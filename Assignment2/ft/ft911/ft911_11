FT  23 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Amoco counters downtrend on
pleasing results

Wall Street
THE DOWNWARD trend in share prices established since record highs for the
major indices were reached last week continued yesterday, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 37.87 at 2,927.72,
near its low for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell
3.25 to 380.95. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks, which
had enjoyed the best run since the start of the year, continued to
underperform yesterday, dropping 6.81 to 494.38.
Turnover on the New York SE was relatively light at 164m shares, and with
declining stocks outpacing rises by a margin of about three-to-one the weak
tone of the overall market was clearly evident.
The recent market rally was fuelled primarily by expectations of US economic
recovery, lower interest rates and a return to corporate profitability later
this year. These hopes are now fully discounted in share prices, and in the
absence of a strong lead from fresh economic news there is little reason for
investors to buy stocks at the moment, said analysts.
Among individual issues, quarterly earnings figures continued to produce a
mixed reaction. In the oil sector, Mobil initially rose against the market
trend after reporting a jump in three-monthly net income to Dollars 1.73 a
share, up from 94 cents posted in the first quarter of 1990. However, the
stock was unable to stand up against the general sell-off and closed down a
net Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 67 5/8 . Amoco proved more resilient, holding on
to its gain to end up Dollars 1/2 at Dollars 54 after also revealing
improved first-quarter earnings, up from the Dollars 466m of last year to
Dollars 803m.
The long-running bid battle between NCR and AT&amp;T took another turn yesterday
as NCR's stock forged ahead Dollars 5 1/8 to Dollars 101 7/8 on turnover of
1.8m shares after AT&amp;T said it was ready to improve its offer for the
computer group to the equivalent of Dollars 110 a share. The development
left AT&amp;T down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 36 1/4 on 2.7m traded.
NCNB retreated Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 37 in active trading after the
regional banking group said it had held merger talks with Southeast Bancorp
and was considering making an offer for the Florida group in the near
future. Southeast rose on the news at first, but eased back to close down
Dollars  1/4 on balance at Dollars 5 3/4 . Bankers Trust put on Dollars  1/2
to Dollars 49 in spite of unveiling a 19 per cent decline in first-quarter
profits to Dollars 160m.
Martin Marietta, the defence equipment manufacturer which makes components
for the Patriot anti-missile missile system used in the Gulf war, fell
Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 55 in the wake of just a modest improvement in
first-quarter net income to Dollars 1.44 a share, against Dollars 1.32 a
share a year ago.
Canada
TORONTO partially recovered from an early decline during a quiet trading
session. The composite index was finally down just 4.4 at 3,491.6, while
declining stocks led advances by 333 to 205. Volume fell to 17m shares from
Friday's 35.4m.
Eight of the 14 sub-groups finished lower, although there were not any
significant declines. Energy, industrial products, financial services and
consumer products all posted small losses. The mining group ended steady
while golds gained 2.49 per cent.
Abitibi-Price, unchanged at CDollars 15 1/4 , saw its first-quarter loss
decrease to 9 cents a share from the 17 cents recorded a year earlier. The
company said it expects 1991 to be 'a difficult year'.

FT  23 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Germany falls 1.7 per cent on
Kohl party's defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff

<TEXT>
THE WEAKNESS of the German government and its currency dragged other bourses
lower yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT reacted to the crushing defeat for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic party in Sunday's state election in the Rhineland
Palatinate, Mr Kohl's home state, and yesterday's fall in the D-Mark to a
16-month low against the dollar.
After an 8.18 or 1.2 per cent fall in the broadly based FAZ index at
midsession, the DAX index closed 27.46, or 1.7 per cent down at 1,571.91,
its intraday low. The heavier falls in the blue chips, said Dresdner Bank in
Frankfurt, indicated that dealers were anticipating foreign selling.
However, the drop in German equity market turnover from DM5.5bn to DM5bn
indicated that prices were marked down, rather than forced down by selling
volume. By the end of the afternoon, too, the leaders were probably a shade
higher than the close on aggregate, in spite of a fall of more than 1 per
cent on Wall Street.
Daimler, Siemens and Deutsche Bank, the main international stocks, fell
DM10.50 to DM680.50, DM10.20 to DM583.30 and DM13 to DM628.50 respectively,
Daimler after stating that 1990 group operating profit was about 10 per cent
below the 1989 level and Siemens on higher net profit for the half year to
March.
PARIS slipped to a five-week low on the last day of the monthly account,
depressed by the French franc's weakness against the dollar and by a finance
scandal which threatened to endanger the government. The CAC-40 index lost
23.92 or 1.3 per cent to 1,767.20, its lowest close since March 20, in
volume estimated at just below FFr2bn. Trading was dominated by arbitrageurs
tidying up their positions at the end of the account.
Among the day's big losers was Paribas, down FFr14 to FFr443, with most of
the 123,025 shares traded attributed to arbitrage activity ahead of the
close of the share swap with Ciments Francais. Alcatel Alsthom, which was
weak last week, fell another that a consortium led by Alcatel had won a
FFr10bn train order from the French state railway. Peugeot gave up some of
last week's recovery, losing FFr10 to FFr543.
In the retail sector, Galeries Lafayette rose FFr70 or 4.1 per cent to
FFr1,800 in thin volume of 380 shares after the company said it would not
make a full bid for Nouvelles Galeries, in which it has a 38 per cent stake.
Nouvelles Galeries fell FFr40 or 5 per cent to FFr760 with 1,350 shares
traded.
MILAN fell across the board in moderate trading, reflecting declines on
foreign markets. Insurance and banking shares, which were sought after last
week, were particularly hard hit as speculative buying petered out. The
Comit index fell 6.65 to 595.99 in volume estimated below Friday's L170bn.
Trading is expected to quieten before the public holiday on Thursday.
Fiat fell L69 to L5,460 and dropped further to L5,435 after hours. Among the
insurers, Generali lost L400 to L38,100 but eased to L37,975 later in the
day, while among banks, Mediobanca fell L415 to L16,215.
Hopes that the protracted feud between Mr Carlo De Benedetti and Mr Silvio
Berlusoni for control of the publisher Mondadori would soon be resolved
lifted Cir, the holding company of Mr De Benedetti, to L2,680 after hours,
after an early fixing at L2,610, down L20. Shares in L'Espresso, 80 per cent
controlled by Mondadori, were suspended at L17,000 amid frantic buying
before being fixed L920 or 5.9 per cent higher at L16,500.
Olivetti eased L75 to L3,845 ahead of its 1990 results due tomorrow.
AMSTERDAM slumped in low volume on fears that the ever-stronger dollar would
do more harm than good to corporate earnings and force the Bundesbank to
raise rates to protect the D-Mark. Bonds were easier. The CBS Tendency index
fell 1.9 or 2 per cent to 94.1.
Fokker, the aircraft manufacturer, lost Fl 1.70 to Fl 31.30 on a weekend
report in the Dutch press that the US airline AMR Corp might not convert 75
aircraft options into firm orders.
STOCKHOLM continued to worry about interest rates and first quarter results.
The Affarsvarlden general index fell 15.8 or 1.5 per cent to 1,058.1. Volume
fell from SKr308m to SKr264m, with one-third generated by Trelleborg and
Ericsson. Trelleborg free B shares fell SKr1 to SKr138 and Ericsson free B's
fell SKr7 to Skr192. SKF free B's fell SKr2 ahead of its first quarter
earnings report due today.
MADRID was lower. A 21 per cent increase consolidated net profit failed to
support Banco Santander, which fell Pta70 to Pta5,510. The general index
closed 2.85 lower at 279.58 in low turnover of Pta15bn.
BRUSSELS saw continued interest in Gechem, the polyurethane foam producer,
on rumours that Societe Generale de Belgique would soon sell its stake. The
ordinary shares jumped 5.9 per cent to BFr832. The Bel 20 index fell 7.54 to
1,203.29 in volume of BFr635m.
ZURICH saw the Credit Suisse index fall 7.3 to 550.0 as a slight firming in
domestic interest rates kept most investors on the sidelines.

FT  23 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar keeps up the gallop
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR was very firm yesterday, particularly against the depressed
D-Mark. The defeat of the ruling Christian Democrats in Sunday's state
election in the Rhineland Palatinate, the home state of German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, increased downward pressure on the currency.
Mr Kohl's political difficulties weighed on the D-Mark at a time when it is
already suffering from the economic problems caused by German unification
and concern about growing instability in the Soviet Union.
The decline of the D-Mark weakened all members of the European exchange rate
mechanism against the dollar, but the US currency was strong in its own
right, improving against non-ERM units such as the Swiss franc and the
Japanese yen.
Hopes of a gradual recovery in US economic performance and fading
expectations of lower US interest rates helped to push the dollar up to
another 16-month high against the D-Mark. This followed on from the renewed
surge in demand seen on Friday.
There was no sign of central bank intervention as it broke through technical
resistance at DM1.7620 yesterday and touched the day's high at another
resistance point of DM1.7680, before closing in London at DM1.7660 compared
with DM1.7360 on Friday.
Finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations meet in
Washington next weekend, amid concern at an apparent lack of agreement on
interest rate policy. It was also noted that the US administration's desire
for lower rates does not appear to be shared by members of the policy-making
US Federal Open Market Committee.
A US press report last week suggested that the FOMC has agreed that interest
rates may be low enough to end the recession. This coupled with concern
among some FOMC members about rekindling inflation if rates are cut were
major factors sparking the dollar's surge over the last two trading days.
At the London close the dollar had also advanced to Y139.40 from Y138.35; to
SFr1.4795 from SFr1.4705; and to FFr5.9475 from FFr5.8575. Its index climbed
to 67.1 from 66.3.
The D-Mark maintained the downward trend against the yen, which resumed last
Thursday after the Bundesbank council failed to increase official German
interest rates. In London the German currency finished at Y78.95, compared
with Y79.70 on Friday and Y81.00 on Thursday.
Sterling lost ground in the ERM, but stayed second strongest, according to
figures from the European Commission.
The pound fell 2.95 cents to Dollars 1.6925, after losing 5 cents on Friday.
It remained steady against the D-Mark, however, closing unchanged at
DM2.9900, while falling to FFr10.0650 from FFr10.0875; to SFr2.5050 from
SFr2.5325; and to Y236.00 from Y238.25. Sterling's index weakened 0.6 to
91.6. In New York the pound recovered a modest 30 points to end at Dollars
1.6955.

FT  23 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nickel development plans as
confidence is boosted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIRM NICKEL prices and the prospect of sustained global growth have
persuaded Falconbridge Ltd to commit CDollars 35m (Pounds 17.6m) to
underground development at its remote Raglan property in northern Quebec
over the next 18 months.
Falconbridge, owned 50-50 by Noranda and Trelleborg of Sweden, is discussing
developing a mine at Raglan with annual output of 20,000 tonnes of nickel.
The cost would be around CDollars 375m, including infrastructure.
The property has been long known as Falconbridge's 'perennial mine of
tomorrow'. The deposit was found after World War II by the late Mr Murray
Watts, one of Canada's most successful mine finders. He was looking for
uranium as well as precious and base metals.
Falconbridge bought control of the property in 1957 and spent many millions
of dollars outlining the deposit. However, its location north of
Schefferville and the northern rail terminus, ruled out development.
Raglan is nearly 1,000 miles north east of Montreal and only 60 miles south
east of Deception Bay, on Hudson Strait, the shipping point for the former
Asbestos Hill mine. During the seventies asbestos fibre was mined openpit
and shipped for refining at Nordenheim in Germany until the US Environmental
Protection Agency finally knocked the bottom out of the international
asbestos market.
Last month, the ice-breaking freighter Arctic, used to move zinc ores from
the central Arctic to European refineries, successfully navigated the
forbidding ice in Deception Bay, tying up at the old asbestos dock.
This means the old three-month shipping season for asbestos can be extended
to eight months, helping Raglan's economics significantly. The mine could
operate year-round and production for four months be stockpiled.
Falconbridge will spend CDollars 20m at Raglan this year alone and has begun
a full feasibility study. Most of the money will go for an underground ramp,
lateral work and drilling.
Raglan is a series of deposits along a 30-mile strike length. Estimated
reserves are 18m tonnes averaging 3.13 per cent nickel and 0.88 per cent
copper in one group of mineralised zones. But total reserves are believed
much larger.
In terms of grade Raglan is the best undeveloped sulphide deposit anywhere,
believes Falconbridge.
The mine would be a fly-in/fly-out operation. A rail connection with
Schefferville was considered in the past, but the rugged terrain makes the
cost prohibitive. The tree line ends just north of Schefferville and the
permafrost then begins.
Potentially, Raglan could increase Falconbridge's annual nickel output by 25
to 30 per cent by 1996. Last year Falconbridge produced 62,000 tonnes from
its mines in Sudbury, Ontario, and in the Dominican Republic.
Nickel prices are around USDollars 4 a lb and many forecast tightness in
supply because of problems in the Soviet Union. Together the Soviet Union
and Cuba have been supplying between 12 and 15 per cent of western demand.
Falconbridge says production in Sudbury and the Dominican Republic will
remain flat for the next few years and Raglan would help retain its world
market share.

FT  23 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fears for farm budget if price
ceiling ignored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission expects the EC farm budget to run out of money
before the end of the year, if the community's agriculture ministers
continue to fail to agree to stay within the mandatory ceiling, or
'guideline', on farm price support.
Brussels is understood to have calculated that the first cash shortages in
the Common Agricultural Policy will appear around October, if ministers push
the tangled debate over this year's price package into June.
Such a delay looked altogether likely last night, as the council of
agriculture ministers began their third attempt since February to fix this
year's prices - by agreeing that any accord would have to wait until next
month at the earliest.
Ten of the 12 farm ministers reiterated their demands that the ceiling be
raised to take account of what they claim is the unforeseen cost of
integrating east German farms into the CAP.
Led by France and Ireland, they want to soften the cuts proposed by the
commission on February 27.
These cuts are intended to limit the rise in farm spending this year to
Ecu7.4bn, a record 30 per cent leap from last year, touching the ceiling of
Ecu32.5bn (Dollars 40bn).
Only the UK, and, with some dithering, the Netherlands, are holding fast to
the guideline, both in the council of farm ministers and finance ministers,
whose unanimous agreement would be needed to breach it.
The UK's fiscally rigid stance was one of three emerging from yesterday's
farm council. In addition:
Ireland was advocating the adoption of the guideline but creation of 'an ad
hoc mechanism', a special reserve, in case it is broken. In common with
France and others, the Irish believe the commission has overreacted to
one-off effects on the beef market, such as the 'mad cow' scare and the Gulf
crisis, has exaggerated overproduction trends, is overly pessimistic about
world farm prices, and has misjudged how fast the dollar is strengthening so
reducing the cost of export subsidies.
France appears still to want to take the wrangle to the European summit due
in June, in the hope of winning sanction for a higher guideline, having
failed to get it on to the agenda of the special summit here on April 8,
devoted almost entirely to the Kurdish emergency.
The finance ministers meeting which took place alongside that summit
replicated the 10-2 division among farm ministers over the guideline.
However, it was a European summit, in Brussels in February 1988, which set
the yearly ceilings.
The Irish idea of a special reserve would, commission and UK officials say,
require the unlikely unanimity of the finance ministers.
However, one of its underlying premises - that Brussels has done its sums
wrong - appears to be buttressed by figures from the commission's periodic
'early warning system' survey of expenditure. These show that price support
to the end of this month has been underspent by Ecu1.1bn. France also
pressed last night for an update.
But commission officials maintain that the seeming underspend is because
certain member states, Italy in particular, are behind in paying out
subsidies to their farmers.
They also dismiss the contention that the stronger dollar will save the
guideline, since its effect will not feed through until next year.
There is concern in the commission, however, that if a summit were to
address farm spending, it might fix guidelines into the future, and queer
the pitch for the radical reform of the CAP which Mr Ray MacSharry, EC
agriculture commissioner, is due to present in detail by July.
Its preferred alternative may in the end be simply to roll over last year's
price package, keep formally within the 1991 guideline and pass on surplus
spending to next year, when it hopes to start the reform.

FT  23 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru cuts taxes and declares
mining emergency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori has declared a state of emergency in the Peruvian
mining industry and announced tax concessions to give the beleaguered sector
a breathing space.
From July, small and medium-sized mines will be exempted from the current 5
per cent emergency tax on copper export. Output from mines in this category
is worth Dollars 750m (Pounds 441m) a year, or over a third of Peru's
earnings from mining. Peru's important silver mining sector will also
benefit from new 'drawback' measures which allow it to reclaim income and
business equity taxes.
Although the measures were welcomed by Mr Luis Rodriguez Mariategui, head of
the National Mining Society, (SNM), it is not clear whether they are in time
to save about 14 medium-sized mines under threat of closure. For example
Huaron, a leading silver, zinc and lead producer has been losing Dollars
800,000 a month since January and is now said to have debts of almost
Dollars 13m.
While plummeting international silver prices mean that silver producers have
been worst hit, the entire sector is in poor shape. Preliminary figures for
1990 indicate that direct losses may be around Dollars 130m, close to those
registered in 1986, the worst year in the last decade. State-owned giant
Centromin lost Dollars 50m last year and is contemplating drastic personnel
cuts. Only five mining companies reported profits last year, according to
preliminary data - Southern Peru Copper, Orcopampa, Milpo, Simsa and Arcata.
Copper output fell 13 per cent in 1990 from 1989, while silver and iron
production declined 15 and 20 per cent respectively. Spare parts and
maintenance problems at HierroPeru, the country's sole iron producer, meant
a fall in iron output from 2.9m tons in 1989 to 2.1m last year. High
international metals prices partially masked the crisis - but this year is
likely to be worse, according to industry sources.
Speaking at the close of the national Mining Engineers' Convention in Lima,
President Fujimori acknowledged the importance of the mining industry. It
generates over half of all foreign exchange earnings and employs one in five
of the population. The solution to the sector's problems, he recognised, lay
in a more realistic exchange rate and lower interest rates.
The dollar-inti exchange rate has scarcely moved since December. The inti is
over-valued by a factor of three, according to the mining industry. Mr David
Ballon, president of the Mining Engineers' Institute says the sector has
lost Dollars 1.62bn in the last two years alone through exchange rate lag.
This has meant low levels of reinvestment and failure to spend on
exploration. Many mines' proven reserves are now perilously low.
Short-term debts also plague the sector. Mines have been forced to borrow
heavily to pay taxes levied on total sales, rather than profits and run
between 20 and 30 per cent of turnover. Interest rates exceed 20 per cent a
month, in spite of a gradual fall in inflation, down to 7.7 per cent last
month. Mining companies' debt positions have been exacerbated by Centromin's
failure for the past several months to pay suppliers.
Participants from abroad at the convention emphasised the need for Peru to
stabilise tax policies and standardise contracts along Chilean lines.
Their call appeared to have been heard by President Fujimori. He promised to
promote mining investment under extraordinary facilities recently granted by
parliament. This, he said, would make laws 'more flexible,' attract risk
capital and favour joint ventures.
If the main problem for Peruvian miners continues to be the exchange rate,
there is another to which there is no solution yet in sight - terrorism. The
SNM counts 304 terrorist actions directed at mining companies during the
last decade, mainly with the object of stealing explosives and other
supplies. Attacks have left 62 dead, it calculates, with a disturbing recent
rise - 14 mining employees were killed in remote mountain camps in December
last year alone.

FT  23 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian government support
package criticised as too little
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S federal government plans to bolster 1991 farm income by CDollars
425m (Pounds 214m) this spring through its Farm Support and Adjustment
Programme.
It claims that this will bring realised farm income to CDollars 3.3bn from
Dollars 3bn in 1990. Realised income is operating profit after depreciation.
But both western and eastern farm groups said that this would not be nearly
enough to counter the farm crisis, particularly on the prairies.
Incomes will remain under pressure from the continuing wheat trade war
between the US and Europe, and the impact of Canada-US free trade on
horticulture.
Western groups were the most critical. The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool said that
the prairies alone needed CDollars 1.3bn this year to offset low prices and
'they gave us Dollars 200m.'
However, Mr Donald Mazankowski, the federal agriculture minister, said that
the government 'just doesn't have the dollars.'
The Farm Support programme replaces emergency annual bail-outs, with income
insurance designed to guarantee participating farmers 90 per cent of
long-term average income in case of crop disasters or low commodity prices.
Further changes in the system are due next year.
The federal government picks up part of the premiums but most provinces have
delayed their contributions and farmers have been slow to sign up. Mr
Mazankowski agrees that the premiums are high.
The government has also announced modest help for horticulture and direct
financial incentives to prairie farmers to take marginal land out of
production.

GERMAN government bonds opened sharply lower yesterday as the market reacted
to the defeat of the ruling Christian Democratic Party in state elections in
the Rhineland Palatinate.
The bund futures contract on the London International Financial Futures
Exchange fell to 84.98 during the morning, against Friday's close of 85.27.
However, the market showed resilience in later trading and the contract
closed at 85.15.
The benchmark 10 per cent government bond maturing 2001 closed on a yield of
8.44 per cent, down from an opening level of 8.38 per cent.
The election defeat gives the opposition Social Democrats an overall
majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German parliament.
The Bundesrat can block any legislation which affects the financing of the
regional lander (such as planned VAT increases and reform of the corporate
tax structure) and any moves to change the way in which the regions are
administered. The gloom was increased by the weakness of the D-Mark on the
foreign exchange market against the dollar. The US currency opened at around
DM1.74 but fell back to trade at around DM1.7640 in late afternoon.
There are fears that the strong dollar could increase import prices, adding
to inflationary pressures in the domestic economy.
Any signs of additional inflationary pressure would be countered by tighter
monetary conditions. Fears of further tightening by the Bundesbank
suppressed bond prices at the shorter maturities end more than at the
10-year maturity.
UK government bond prices showed little reaction to retail sales figures for
March which pointed to a sharp upturn in consumer expenditure.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent government bond issue maturing 2003/2007
opened at 110 9/32 and closed just  1/32 down on the day, for a yield of
10.22 per cent.
Figures showing retail sales growth of 3.7 per cent for March over the
previous month were dismissed as a freak by analysts.
Most had predicted a month-on-month upturn of between 0.3 per cent and 0.7
per cent. The unexpected increase was blamed on a rush by consumers to buy
goods before the new rate of VAT (17.5 per cent against 15 per cent at the
old rate) came into effect on April 1. Elsewhere, the evidence remains
mixed. Money supply figures on Friday showed M0, the narrow measure of notes
and coins in circulation, growing at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent. Yet
bank lending was recorded at an all-time low.
JAPANESE government bonds fell back during Tokyo trading as the yen
continued to depreciate against the dollar on the foreign exchange markets.
The benchmark government bond issue No129 closed in Tokyo on a yield of
6.725 per cent, against a close of 6.705 per cent on Friday. In London
trading the 129 slipped further for a yield of 6.73 per cent by late
afternoon.
Trading remained focused on the foreign exchange market, where the dollar
continued to move higher against the major currencies, including the yen.
The US currency opened at Y138.75 and pressed ahead to around Y139.30 by the
close of London trading.
The strength of the dollar will, if sustained, increase the cost of many
imported goods into Japan. This could delay any easing of monetary
conditions by the Bank of Japan later this year.
Tomorrow, the government is expected to issue Y800bn of 10-year securities,
with a coupon of either 6.7 per cent or 6.8 per cent.
IN THE absence of a lead from economic news US government bond prices edged
lower yesterday ahead of this week's injection of fresh supply by the
Treasury. In late trading the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue was down  1/2
at 95 13/32 , to yield 8.285 per cent. The two-year note was only slightly
lower, down  1/32 at 100 1/8 , yielding 7.034 per cent.
The market appears resigned to the fact that the Federal Reserve is not
going to cut interest rates in the near future. The sell-off that came in
the wake of the Fed's inaction is complete, and yesterday's weakness was
primarily a technical move ahead of the two and five-year note auctions due
on Wednesday and Thursday this week, said dealers.
In the money markets the Fed intervened via overnight matched sales
agreements to drain reserves from the system and exert an upward pressure on
the Fed funds rate. The Fed's target for the rate remains 6 per cent, and
yesterday Fed funds were trading just below it at 5 13/16 per cent.

FIRST-QUARTER earnings at Union Carbide, the US chemicals producer, would
have matched last year's levels were it not for the serious disruption
caused by an explosion last month at its chemicals plant at Seadrift, Texas.
Net earnings dropped to Dollars 83m or 54 cents a share from Dollars 94m or
65 cents a share. Sales slipped by 3 per cent to Dollars 1.86bn.
Union Carbide estimates that the Seadrift explosion cost it about Dollars
18m in lost profits. It expects to restore most ethylene and polyethylene
production at the plant by the end of this month, but production of ethylene
dioxide and related products is unlikely to restart before the summer.
Mr Robert Kennedy, chairman, said the first-quarter earnings were better
than expected, thanks to falling raw material costs and strong export
shipments of some chemicals, especially ethylene glycol.
But he warned that the recession and extra capacity coming on stream may
dampen chemicals and plastics earnings for the rest of this year.
Industrial gas sales fell by 17 per cent in the quarter.

643m tax claim

<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS to rehabilitate Executive Life of California, the main operating
unit of troubled Los Angeles-based insurer First Executive, have run into a
serious obstacle from the Internal Revenue Service, which claims to be owed
Dollars 643m.
Mr John Garamendi, the Californian insurance commissioner who seized control
of Executive Life earlier this month, warned that the move 'could force the
company into liquidation and jeopardise the savings of hundreds of thousands
of policyholders and annuitants'.
The Los Angeles office of the IRS, however, said that while it was obviously
concerned about policyholders' welfare, it had a duty to the US public to
make sure that demands for back tax were logged.
The IRS claim covers tax which the authorities say the company should have
paid in 1981, 1982 and 1983, together with penalties and interest due
because of the non-payment. The IRS declined to split the tax sum from the
penalty/interest charges, although there were reports that the actual tax
claim totalled less than Dollars 250m.
The IRS acknowledged that the penalties/interest element was likely to be
substan-tial.
The Californian regulators have recently suggested that rehabilitation
efforts were centring on talks with a European consortium, led by Altus,
part of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank.
Yesterday, officials at the Insurance Department said they did not know what
the reaction of the consortium had been to the tax demand.
However, Mr Garamendi said that he would 'do everything in my power to stop
this IRS raid on the assets needed to pay Executive Life policyholders. I
plan to immediately contact both the Bush administration and Congressional
leaders,' he added.

ITT, the US conglomerate with interests ranging from defence to insurance,
yesterday reported a 9.4 per cent fall in first-quarter profits, to Dollars
229m after tax.
Earnings per share also fell away, from Dollars 1.77 to Dollars 1.7, but, in
both cases, comparisons were distorted by one-off items. On the one hand,
the first quarter of 1991 took in portfolio gains of Dollars 35m - or 26
cents a share - mainly at ITT Hartford, the insurance arm. This contrasted
with portfolio gains of Dollars 4m, or three cents a share, in the same
period a year earlier.
On the other hand, the first quarter of 1990 was boosted by an after-tax
gain of Dollars 47m from the sale of the stake in Alcatel Alsthom. ITT said
that without this item net income in the first quarter would have improved
by 18 per cent.
ITT said that its electronic components business improved on higher volumes
and better efficiencies at ITT semiconductors. ITT Defence also had a better
quarter due to more favourable margins on certain contracts.

restructuring

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OCCIDENTAL Petroleum has begun to reap the tax benefits of a Dollars 2.2bn
restructuring charge taken after the death last December of Dr Armand
Hammer, who presided over the Los Angeles-based energy and chemicals group
for more than half a century.
Net first-quarter earnings were Dollars 136m or 45 cents a share, up from
Dollars 108m (37 cents a share) a year earlier. The latest figure, however,
includes a Dollars 53m tax benefit from operating loss carryforwards created
by last year's restructuring. These carryforwards, which totalled Dollars
1.7bn last December, can be set against taxes on operating income and
capital gains. They are recorded as an extraordinary item.
Mr Ray Irani, who took over as chairman when Dr Hammer died, has taken the
scalpel to Occidental with the aim of concentrating on the core businesses
of oil, gas and chemicals. He has put several of Dr Hammer's pet projects on
the block, and laid off 1,000 employees. He signalled a break from the past
by moving the annual meeting from Dr Hammer's birthday on May 20 to a date
10 days earlier.
Oil and gas earnings in the first quarter rose 22 per cent to Dollars 122m,
reflecting higher oil prices and production, higher international natural
gas volumes and improved domestic gas liquids prices.
On the other hand, earnings from chemicals dipped by 25 per cent to Dollars
139m, as a result, among other things, of higher feedstock prices and lower
farm products volumes.
Amoco Corp lifted its first-quarter earnings by 6 per cent to Dollars 803m
or Dollars 1.60 a share from Dollars 466m, or 91 cents a share a year
earlier, due largely to a benefit from a change in accounting for income
taxes. Excluding this benefit, earnings of the Chicago-based energy producer
rose 6 per cent to Dollars 492m. Refining and marketing income rose to
Dollars 214m from Dollars 129m, due to wider refining margins.
On the other hand, earnings from exploration and production fell steeply,
both in the US and internationally. The drop was due to lower natural gas
prices, a fall in domestic crude oil output and higher exploration expenses.
Olin, the Connecticut-based chemicals and special metals producer, took an
Dollars 80m charge in the first quarter as part of a restructuring. Other
measures include a 10 per cent cut in the salaried workforce and the sale of
several businesses.
These include industrial phosphates, electronic chemical and inter-connect
operations, and some small chemical and metal product lines. As a result
Olin suffered a first-quarter loss of Dollars 59m (Dollars 2.20 a share),
against earnings of Dollars 32m (Dollars 1.60 a share) a year earlier.

MARTIN Marietta, the US aerospace company whose Patriot missiles hit the
headlines during the Gulf war, lifted first-quarter earnings by 6 per cent
to Dollars 71.1m after tax,from Dollars 67.1m in the same period a year ago.
But revenues fell to Dollars 1.4bn from Dollars 1.42bn. Marietta said the
fall stemmed partly from non-recurring sales from a commercial Titan rocket
launch in the first quarter of 1990, and partly from the effects of the
recession and poor weather.
At the operating level, Marietta reported a slightly sharper rise of 13 per
cent to Dollars 108m. But 'other income' fell to Dollars 1.7m from Dollars
6.8m, while interest expenses rose from Dollars 10.2m to Dollars 12.1m. The
earnings per share figure was much in line with analysts' expectations, at
Dollars 1.44, against Dollars 1.32.

recession and war costs

<TEXT>
THE IMPACT of recession on advertising and the cost of covering the Gulf war
has cut the profitability of Capital Cities/ABC, one of the three big US
television networks. It yesterday unveiled a 38 per cent slump in
first-quarter operating income to Dollars 130.3m and warned of a further
decline in the second quarter.
The company owns the ABC radio and television national networks, local
television and radio stations and weekly newspapers, including the Fairchild
fashion trade publications. First-quarter net income fell 45 per cent to
Dollars 58.6m or Dollars 3.50 a share from Dollars 106.3m or Dollars 6.08 a
year earlier on revenues essentially unchanged at Dollars 1.26bn. Operating
income was Dollars 130.3m, against Dollars 211.5m a year ago, while income
before taxes dropped 44 per cent to Dollars 103.4m from Dollars 186.2m.
Capital Cities/ABC's weak first-quarter performance comes on the heels of
poor results from CBS and General Electric's NBC broadcasting, which were
also hurt by higher news costs and the very weak advertising market.
Revenues from the company's broadcasting operating advanced to Dollars 1bn
from Dollars 992.5m, due to the telecast of the Super Bowl and two National
Football League Wild Card play-off games.

</HEADLINE>

   By BERNARD SIMON

<TEXT>
BANKERS Trust, the highly- regarded US banking group, suffered a 19 per cent
fall in first-quarter earnings, with a strong advance in trading income more
than offset by higher non-interest expenses, lower foreign exchange revenues
and write-offs on investments in highly-leveraged companies.
Net earnings slipped to Dollars 160m or Dollars 1.85 a share from Dollars
198m or Dollars 2.36 a year earlier. Interest income fell only slightly to
Dollars 213m.
The company blamed an 8.4 per cent rise in non-interest expenses partly on
the weaker dollar, which accounted for about a quarter of the increase.
Staff severance costs jumped by Dollars 40m.
Trading revenues almost doubled to Dollars 304m, thanks largely to a strong
performance by the capital markets business, which includes interest rate,
currency and equity derivative products. But corporate finance fees tumbled
by 23 per cent.
Loans on BT's books continue to fall sharply, reflecting the policy of the
past four years of distributing a higher proportion of loans to other
financial institutions, such as regional and foreign banks, insurance
companies and pension funds. BT's total loan portfolio stood at Dollars
19.6bn on March 31, down from Dollars 29.2bn in 1986.
BT is less exposed to the depressed real estate market than some other US
money-centre banks, but it has nonetheless not been left unscarred. The bank
lifted loan-loss provisions to Dollars 51m from Dollars 40m a year earlier.
Non-performing assets, other than renegotiated Third World debt, jumped to
Dollars 164m on March 31 from Dollars 65m. Real estate credits made up the
bulk of the increase.

<TEXT>
AVON Products, the world's biggest maker of cosmetics and toiletries,
yesterday turned in a 20 per cent improvement in first-quarter net income.
The result included strong gains from the company's overseas operations
offsetting the deteriorating performance of its US business.
For the first three months of 1991, Avon had net income of Dollars 18.4m or
16 cents a share against Dollars 15.2m or 11 cents a year ago. Revenues grew
9 per cent to Dollars 769.6m from Dollars 703.8m.
The 1991 figures include a Dollars 7m settlement with Chartwell Associates,
the investor group which recently agreed to abstain from launching a proxy
fight for increased control of Avon's board for 10 years, after nearly two
years of consistent pressure on Avon.
Mr James Preston, Avon's chairman, said the company expects a good year in
1991 thanks to its strong international position. 'Avon continues to benefit
from having a global portfolio of businesses that minimises the impact of a
recession in one country or region.'
The New York-based company said pre-tax profits from its international
business grew 40 per cent in the quarter on a 25 per cent improvement on
sales, led by Europe and the Americas. In the US, Avon's pre-tax profit fell
12 per cent on a 7 per cent decline in sales. This reflected the continued
impact of recession, particularly in the northeast.
Avon, which has been steadily reducing its debt, said debt at the end of the
1991 first quarter was Dollars 572.7m, down 18 per cent on a year earlier.

KOHLBERG, Kravis, Roberts, the New York buy-out investment boutique and one
of the most powerful takeover players in the US, and Fleet/Norstar Financial
group have succeeded in their joint bid to acquire most of the assets of the
failed Bank of New England (BNE), once the second-biggest bank in the
region.
The three BNE 'bridge banks', with combined assets of about Dollars 15bn,
will be managed by Fleet, which will raise Dollars 683m of new capital
including Dollars 283m to be provided by investors advised by KKR. The
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp will receive Dollars 125m as a premium -
Dollars 100m in preferred stock and Dollars 25m in cash.
BNE was declared insolvent and seized by regulators in January.
The KKR/Fleet Norstar group had competed against BankAmerica, the big San
Francisco bank and Bank of Boston in a bidding contest for BNE, whose assets
are estimated at Dollars 20bn. Mr William Seidman, FDIC chairman, said:
'Based on an analysis of the proposals the board determined that selecting
Fleet would have the lowest cost to the bank insurance fund.'
Mr Seidman said KKR would not exercise control of bank activity. The FDIC
said the cost of the bailout would cost the treasury about 10 per cent more
than the Dollars 2.3bn originally estimated.
The assistance package, agreed in principle, will give Fleet the right to
put to the FDIC any classified loans and repossessed assets now on the books
of the bridge banks for three years.
The decision to award BNE to the Fleet/Norstar group raises questions about
the future of Bank of Boston. 1990. According to some analysts, there is
concern that without the capital from BNE, Bank of Boston may fail.
Mr Ira Stepanian, chairman of Bank of Boston, said a BNE acquisition would
have accelerated Bank of Boston's recovery, 'but the FDIC's decision by no
means negates it.'

<TEXT>
IFI International (Ifint), the Luxembourg-based holding company partly owned
by Italy's Agnelli family, has acquired an option to become the largest
single shareholder in Exor, the investment group which controls the Perrier
mineral water group.
Ifint told the French stockmarket authorities yesterday that it could raise
its existing 13.5 per cent stake in Exor, to just over 21 per cent. However,
a Perrier spokesman said the deal will have no impact on the mineral water
group.
It is not known whether Ifint plans to exercise its option, although the
mere fact of owning it means the group is considered under French law to
have lifted its stake in Exor to above 20 per cent, at which level it has to
make an announcement.
If Ifint exercises its option, it will overtake Ms Corinne Mentzelopoulos,
whose family is Exor's main shareholder and who now owns 18.6 per cent of
the group. Analysts said this is unlikely to change the Mentzelopoulos'
control of Exor.
Exor made no comment yesterday and securities analysts confessed to being
baffled by the deal. The Agnelli family could be strengthening its French
industrial portfolio, which already includes stakes in BSN, the food group,
Accor in hotels, and the Pechelbronn holding group, said Mr Sylvain Massot,
food and beverages analyst at Morgan Stanley's London office.
Ifint paid around FFr700m (Dollars 119.5m) for its existing 13.5 per cent
share in Exor in January, making it then the group's third biggest
shareholder.
It has now acquired options for another 7.86 per cent from Rovida, a
Swiss-based holding company and currently the second largest shareholder,
which had 18.2 per cent of Exor's stock.
Ifint, 23 per cent of whose ordinary shares are owned by the
Agnelli-controlled Istituto Finanziario Industriale, bought its stake as
part of a complex share swap with Ms Mentzelopoulos.

FT  23 APR 91 / Treuhand poised to boost German paper market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FLEDGLING German commercial paper market is to receive an important
boost from the Treuhand, the state-backed agency responsible for privatising
east German companies, through plans for a large borrowing programme to
finance restructuring investments.
The Treuhand is today expected to announce a commercial paper programme,
arranged by Dresdner Bank, of up to DM2bn (Pounds 600m), making it the
largest programme of its kind since the market began to take shape earlier
this year. If the issue runs smoothly, the Treuhand may test the market
again to cover more of its DM25bn borrowing limit for 1991.
Some Treuhand officials have speculated that the organisation will make use
of commercial paper, among other instruments, gradually to take over up to
DM70bn of the DM100bn in old debts that the corporate sector in former east
Germany is still theoretically carrying.
The Treuhand is already paying interest to the Bundesbank on those debts and
some analysts believe that it would be better to centralise the debt under
one roof. The Bonn finance ministry admits that much of the corporate debt
will not be repaid but it officially prefers a case-by-case policy on debt
forgiveness.
The commercial paper market is only available to the best risk borrowers who
then acquire relatively favourable terms. The Treuhand can exploit its
semi-government status to save money on its extensive borrowing needs. The
maturity of the first issue is expected to be one year.
The Treuhand declined to comment yesterday on when, if at all, it intended
to tap the commercial paper market, but finance ministry officials confirmed
that such a move, rumoured for some time, was now imminent.
The move is likely to be welcomed in Frankfurt where financiers will be keen
to see the commercial paper market given some ballast. German companies have
long complained of restricted financing options in their home market and the
shortage has forced them to turn to the Euromarkets.
Commercial paper only became possible in Germany earlier this year when the
Bundesbank withdrew its previous objections, finance ministry permission for
such issues was no longer required, and the turnover tax on securities was
abolished.
Since then, the biggest issue announced, although not yet completed, was a
DM500m programme for Daimler Benz arranged by Deutsche Bank. Daimler already
has a commercial paper programme in Dutch guilders and in dollars.

FT  23 APR 91 / Ratners to shed jobs despite profit rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATNERS Group, the jewellery chain, will implement a cost-cutting programme
this year leading to the loss of up to 1,000 jobs, as it tries to combat
recessionary markets in the UK and the US.
Although the company pushed annual pre-tax profits up from Pounds 108.22m to
Pounds 110.05m before property gains, Ratners' fully-diluted earnings per
share fell 9 per cent to 23.6p as cost increases outstripped sales growth.
Mr Gerald Ratner, chairman, said the company would reduce staff by 5 per
cent as well as cut stockholding and distribution costs and trim some of its
guarantees and credit terms. 'It is no good just hibernating like a hedgehog
during a recession,' he said.
Sales in the year to February 2 topped Pounds 1bn for the first time,
climbing 24 per cent to Pounds 1.11bn.
The results were buoyed up by the inclusion of Kay Jewelers, the US chain
which was bought for Pounds 207m last year. Kay, which has been quickly
integrated with Ratners' existing Sterling business in the US, contributed
Pounds 14m to operating profits.
Overall, operating profits rose 3.6 per cent to Pounds 134.25m. The UK saw a
reduced contribution of Pounds 79.74m (Pounds 93.37m), but the US added
Pounds 54.5m (Pounds 36.12m).
Most of Ratners' UK high street chains registered comparable sales
increases: H. Samuel produced a 13 per cent gain; Ratners, 18 per cent; and
Zales and Ernest Jones 19 per cent.
Watches of Switzerland, the group's most upmarket chain, suffered from a
drop in tourists and recorded an 11 per cent slide in sales, while
Salisburys, the handbag chain, incurred a loss of Pounds 1m. Salisburys will
be trimmed from 220 stores to 170 at an exceptional cost of Pounds 2m. An
extraordinary charge of Pounds 6.74m was also taken as a result of the
company's decision to shut its Regent Jewellers chain, which operates 43
stock clearance branches.
Ratners said it had increased its market share in the UK by 3 percentage
points to 33 per cent and that it now commanded 5 per cent of the US market.
Mr Ratner said: 'With the competition collapsing there is nothing out there
to stop us.'
A final dividend of 7.6p will lift the annual pay-out to 10p, a 5 per cent
increase.
Ratners Group said that Sir Victor Garland, a non-executive director of the
Prudential Corporation, had joined the board as a non-executive director.

FT  23 APR 91 / AT&amp;T raises stakes in battle for NCR: Offer for computer
maker increased to Dollars 110 per share in paper bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The hostile takeover battle for NCR took a dramatic turn this week when
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US telecommunications group, offered to
increase its bid to Dollars 110-a-share. However, the new proposal also
suggested replacing the cash consideration by all-paper terms.
Yesterday, NCR said that it was concerned that the AT&amp;T offer might not be
worth as much as Dollars 110 a share by the time the offer closed, if AT&amp;T
shares fell heavily. 'That's the sticking point,' said an NCR official.
NCR, the fifth-largest computer manufacturer in the US, has been in
discussions all weekend with AT&amp;T officials. The NCR board has yet to make
any official comment on the proposal announced late on Sunday night.
If AT&amp;T is now in sight of achieving its aim of buying NCR, the only sure
winners are likely to be NCR's own shareholders.
The takeover battle is likely to cost AT&amp;T Dollars 1.36bn more than it
bargained for; and there will be no guarantee that AT&amp;T's dreams of building
a successful global information technology company - spanning computers and
communications - can be realised.
NCR shareholders will have seen the value of their investments increase
almost two and a third times in the past four months if the latest proposal
goes ahead.
They owe thanks for their good fortune to the rugged determination of Mr
Charles 'Chuck' Exley, NCR president, to hold out for the best possible
price once it seemed clear there was no hope of resisting AT&amp;T's embrace.
It was not a universally popular attitude. NCR's shareholders interested in
the future of the company as a computer business applaud Mr Exley's apparent
intransigence; those who are interested chiefly in realising the value of
their investment as quickly as possible - Wall Street's arbitrage community
 -think he has merely been dragging out the inevitable.
AT&amp;T's opening bid in December last year - at Dollars 90 a share - valued
NCR at Dollars 6.12bn. Although Mr Exley immediately rejected the offer -
arguing there was no industrial logic in the takeover - he suggested that
the companies could do business if AT&amp;T valued NCR at Dollars 8.5bn or
Dollars 125 a share.
From that point, resistance deteriorated into price haggling. Mr Exley
reduced his demand to Dollars 110 a share while Mr Robert Allen, chairman of
AT&amp;T, raised his offer first to Dollars 100 a share and then two days ago to
NCR's asking price. The latest offer values the company at Dollars 7.48bn.
Under AT&amp;T's new proposal, investors would get 2.943 AT&amp;T shares for every
NCR share held. AT&amp;T claimed that this was the equivalent of Dollars 110 a
share, based on AT&amp;T's close on Friday.
To protect NCR investors against a future fall in AT&amp;T stock, the bidder
said it would be willing to offer up to 3.099 shares if the price averaged
less than Dollars 37.375 during a 20-day period ahead of an NCR shareholder
meeting to vote on the merger. Yesterday, NCR's shares rose Dollars 5 1/8 to
Dollars 101 7/8 - well short of the Dollars 110 figure - with AT&amp;T falling
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 36 1/8 .
The new offer could break the impasse in what has been one of the most
bitterly-fought takeover battles the modern computer industry has ever
witnessed. If the offer is accepted, then AT&amp;T will have spent more than
Dollars 12m in legal fees and NCR about Dollars 7m on its defensive
strategy.
From the outset, a sizeable proportion of NCR's shareholders had wanted to
accept the AT&amp;T bid. AT&amp;T, however, was constrained from simply buying
shares in the market by Maryland's takeover laws.
NCR showed an appetite for the fight which surprised those familiar with its
sleepy marketing methods. It deployed a series of 'poison pill' defences
including an employee share ownership scheme, which was later declared
invalid.
AT&amp;T set up a proxy battle at the NCR shareholders' meeting in March and
succeeded in ousting four directors, including the chairman.
AT&amp;T's battle for NCR is, however, likely to prove only the beginning of a
very long road for North America's largest telecommunications company.
The history of mergers between large electronics groups is stained with red
ink and littered with failures.
Unisys, for example, the world's fifth-largest computer company forged five
years ago from parts of Sperry and the Burroughs Corporation, lost Dollars
436m in 1990. It is still struggling to resolve the problem of two
completely different product families.
Siemens-Nixdorf, put together just over 12 months ago from the loss-making
Nixdorf and the barely-profitable computer operations of Siemens, is
expected to lose money this year. It is proving difficult to find common
ground between the radically different cultures of the two companies.
Groupe Bull, which two years ago took over the US personal computer
manufacturer, Zenith, has been experiencing similar problems. This is
despite Groupe Bull's declared intention to manage the company at arms
length from the rest of its computer operations.
Groupe Bull is being propped up with FFr4bn (Pounds 397m) of investment from
its largest shareholder, the French government.
Furthermore, over the past decade both AT&amp;T and International Business
Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, have made abortive
efforts to invade each other's territory.
AT&amp;T's basic plan is to merge its small and unsuccessful computer business
into NCR, leaving the Ohio-based company essentially alone to manage the
business. Superficially, it is an attractive idea.
For a new computer company to stand a chance of success today it must:
Have identified a market niche in which it can be a leader;
Offer products based on low-cost, standard microprocessor chips;
Offer 'open' systems based on standard operating software; Have firm control
of 'channels' - dealers, value-added resellers and software houses who
provide the conduit between the manufacturers and their customers.
AT&amp;T developed, and owns copyright on, the software system, Unix, which most
manufacturers now agree will become the industry standard for open systems.
NCR, alone among the large computer manufacturers, has taken the plunge into
designs based on low-cost microprocessors and the Unix operating system.
Despite the fact that it is not among the world's top 10 computer
manufacturers, NCR is a leading supplier of financial systems and dominates
the market for automated teller machines - 'holes-in-the-wall'.
NCR, which began as a manufacturer of cash registers in the 1800s, would
give AT&amp;T's computer ambitious a powerful fillip through its distribution
channels. It has already been identified by Europe's largest manufacturers
as a potential route into the US market.
The big question is whether it will be possible for the staff of two such
different companies to work together profitably.
AT&amp;T has no record of success in computers. Its computer division turns over
about Dollars 1.5bn a year and loses about Dollars 200m.
A merger with NCR may be its last chance. But if it fails, it will bring the
computer manufacturer down with it and Chuck Exley's worst fears about a
merger he never wanted will have been realised.

FT  23 APR 91 / CBI finds upbeat outlook on R&amp;D: Survey contrasts sharply
with last month's gloomy report from the Lords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SURPRISINGLY upbeat picture of investment in innovation by UK businesses,
in spite of the recession, emerges from a survey by the Confederation of
British Industry.
According to the CBI's second annual innovation trends survey, 55 per cent
of UK manufacturing companies are satisfied that their spending on
innovation is adequate to meet future competitive pressures, while 37 per
cent think it is inadequate.
The survey contrasts sharply with the tone of last month's House of Lords
report on innovation in manufacturing industry, which claimed that
British-owned manufacturing industry could almost disappear if the
government did not abandon its 'hands-off' attitude.
Mr John Banham, CBI director-general, said yesterday there was no sense of
complacency in its trends survey. He added: 'The facts do not sit well with
the conclusions of the Lords committee - translated into plain English they
were wrong'.
Mr Banham said UK businesses spent Pounds 6.5bn on research and development
in 1989, a higher proportion of gross domestic product than any other
European Community country except Germany. The survey showed that on balance
this was being maintained last year.
'All is by no means gloom and doom, which is what you might conclude if you
were an avid reader of the Lords report,' he said.
Two thirds of the 336 companies taking part in the survey spent up to 5 per
cent of sales on innovation - which is defined as the development of new
products, processes and services - and just over one fifth spent up to 10
per cent.
The survey identified a marked trend downwards in the use of consultants and
a rise in expenditure on joint ventures or co-operation with other
companies, particularly overseas. New regulations, especially tougher
environmental rules, were seen by some companies as an opportunity and by
others as a threat.
Mrs Fiona Steele, CBI's head of technology and innovation policy, said the
survey showed that UK companies saw an increasing competitive threat from EC
and other UK companies, rather than from Japan and the US. She cautioned,
however, that the survey was intended to identify trends rather than
absolute values.
The survey was carried out in October and November and follows a more
limited pilot study of trends in 1989. It is sponsored for five years by
National Westminster Bank's technology unit.

FT  23 APR 91 / Iraq accused of holding Kuwaitis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT accused Iraq yesterday of continuing to hold more than 5,400 Kuwaiti
civilians and soldiers and of failing to return stolen property, as required
by a United Nations Security Council resolution.
The Kuwaiti ambassador to the UN, Mr Mohammad Abol Hassan, wrote to the
Council saying that Baghdad's failure to adhere to Security Council
resolution 686 'puts the credibility and motives of the Iraqi regime under
suspicion'.
In accepting the resolution, adopted two days after the end of the Gulf war,
Baghdad had pledged to carry it out 'swiftly and honestly'.
The regime of president Saddam Hussein has said it accepts all Security
Council resolutions adopted since the invasion of Kuwait, including two that
impose financial liability on Iraq. But Baghdad has not explicitly announced
that it accepts liability and will pay damages.
The letter also complained that Iraq has failed to begin returning goods it
plundered from Kuwait during the seven-month occupation. Iraq has agreed to
return gold, currency, Kuwait Airways aircraft and museum collections and
antiquities.
Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, said yesterday during a visit to
Kuwait that he had received assurances from the Emir that human rights
abuses against minorities in the country had ceased.
He said that Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah had conceded during talks that there had
been some human rights abuses in the days after liberation and that the Emir
'made it clear the extent to which the government of Kuwait regrets that'.
Mr Baker said that Sheikh Saad al-Sabah, the prime minister, and the Emir
had told him that they would be 'pleased to invite human rights
organisations to interview minorities - Palestinians and others'.
Amnesty International, the human rights group, said in a report last week
that there had been many substantiated cases of abuse against Palestinians
by Kuwaitis since the liberation and that there was evidence that such
abuses continued.
Only hours before Mr Baker's arrival, the Kuwaiti government refused
permission for opposition groups to hold a news conference and ordered the
lights to be turned off in a Kuwait City hotel ballroom where the event was
to be held.
Opposition figures said that the incident showed that the ruling al-Sabah
family was not sincere about allowing greater democracy and free speech.

FT  23 APR 91 / Moscow looks to Ecu for trade fillip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOVIET UNION is to discuss today with three of Europe's leading banks a
payments system that could ease trade among the former communist nations of
eastern Europe and help them to move to a free-market economy.
Officials from Gosbank, the Soviet central bank, are meeting in Turin to
talk about the concept with representatives of Deutsche Bank of Germany,
Credit Lyonnais of France and San Paolo Bank of Italy. These three groups
have indicated general support for the idea, possibly through establishing
lines of credit.
The state banks of Poland, Czechoslavakia and Hungary are also to be
represented at the meeting. An official from the European Commission, which
may support the venture financially, is taking part.
The system under discussion would use the Ecu, a basket of the main west
European currencies, as a common financial unit in settling transactions
between banks in eastern Europe that arise from trade payments.
It would replace the system formerly used in eastern Europe for trade-based
banking settlements, which was based on the transferable rouble.
The transferable rouble was abolished earlier this year as part of the
process of adopting western-style economic thinking in the former
communist-bloc nations. Since then, trade among the countries in the region
has been hit due to the lack of an alternative payments procedure.
The Ecu-based system could start in about a year, assuming planning proceeds
smoothly. It would use computers and financial procedures based on an
existing Ecu payments-clearing system.
It is thought that initially the east European venture would administer a
far smaller total of transactions, involving about 15 commercial banks in
eastern Europe. Later, it could be extended to incorporate transactions
involving banks in western Europe, so bolstering trade between the eastern
and western parts of the continent.
According to one idea under discussion, the system could be run by a
consortium of east European commercial banks, possibly with help from
western partners.
Representatives from four commercial banks from the former communist states
have indicated an interest in this idea and are attending the Turin meeting.
The banks are the International Bank for Economic Co-operation of the Soviet
Union; Investicni Banka of Czechoslovakia; the Inter Europa Bank of Hungary;
and Poland's State Savings Bank. Setting up the system would cost about
Ecu1m.
The meeting in Turin has been initiated by the Ecu Banking Association, a
group of European banks. Mr Dominique Rambure, chairman of the association
and a senior executive at San Paolo Bank, said: 'The system would be a step
in the right direction of getting eastern Europe away from centralised
economic planning.'

FT  23 APR 91 / Tesco chairman's earnings top Pounds 1.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Ian MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, the grocery chain, received total
remuneration of Pounds 1.48m last year, representing a steep increase on his
previous year's basic pay of Pounds 345,000.
The pay of the chairman of Britain's second-biggest food retailing chain
advanced by Pounds 45,000 to Pounds 390,000. In addition, however, he
received a substantial boost from the inclusion of Pounds 1.09m in
performance-related incentive payments.
The payments related to a scheme introduced in 1988 which linked directors'
bonuses to the performance of the company's earnings per share. Over the
three-year period, Tesco's earnings per share rose by 71 per cent.
Four of Tesco's other executive directors benefited strongly from the
incentive scheme. Last year, one earned over Pounds 610,000, another more
than Pounds 665,000, and two are bracketed in the Pounds 785,000 to Pounds
790,000 pay range.
In total, the amount paid out to all directors in the year to February 23,
1991, increased from Pounds 2.24m to Pounds 6.74m. Next year, however, the
directors will receive only Pounds 1.8m between them under the incentive
scheme as opposed to the accumulated three-year total of Pounds 4.33m they
received last year.
The growth in Sir Ian's remuneration follows a series of big rises for
senior executives at a number of the UK's largest companies.

FT  23 APR 91 / Labour's pay plans suffer further blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR party plans to reform wage bargaining were dealt a further blow
yesterday when the AEU engineering union rejected a second attempt in two
weeks by the Trades Union Congress to resolve inter-union differences on the
issue.
The decision of the executive of the the AEU, the UK's fourth-largest union,
illustrates difficulties faced by the Labour movement in formulating a
consensus on plans to create a national minimum wage and hold a yearly
national economic assessment.
Such an assessment, in which a Labour government, unions and employers would
take part, would be used to set a national minimum wage. The two policies
form the centre-piece of Labour's plans to reform wage bargaining.
Failure to find a meaningful compromise could leave the Labour party open to
charges that it and the unions have not resolved the pay-bargaining
difficulties that helped to topple the last Labour administration in 1979.
AEU objections to the plans of the TUC and the Labour party are especially
damaging because the union is one of the more moderate, and normally among
the party's most loyal supporters.
The AEU executive decided it could not accept a redraft of a TUC paper in
which unions were asked to agree that, in pay talks for higher-paid workers
under a Labour government, they would not cite any rise in the proposed
national minimum wage.
The wording has changed from the previous draft, which said unions would
disregard the minimum wage in talks on other pay levels. AEU members fear
the new version still implies an unacceptable erosion of wage differentials.
AEU representatives will press at the TUC general council tomorrow for
further changes, although some executive members believe the clause should
be removed.
The union, which supports a national minimum wage, will also seek amendments
to other parts of the document to emphasise further the rejection by unions
of any form of wage restraint. Mr Bill Jordan, AEU president, said
suggestions that skilled workers' pay should be held down were 'not only
economic madness, but will be implemented over this union's dead body'.
He said the Labour movement needed to study the issue further. Failure to do
so might lead to a dangerous diversion from Labour's central objective of
regaining power.

FT  23 APR 91 / Letter: Why company well-being is a priority for banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PH NUNNERLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As you would expect I totally disagree with the letter from Jeremy
Parker (April 15) suggesting the clearing banks were often too tardy in
helping ailing companies.
We currently have some 400,000 small business customers on our books and are
deeply committed to ensuring that our customers' well-being is a top
priority - it has to be in order to guarantee our own future as a viable
company.
Mr Parker chides us for not using our 'early warning systems' to detect the
first signs of decline in the quality of security. In many respects we are
largely in the hands of the companies themselves - in a recession the most
ominous sign to a good bank manager can be the total lack of contact with a
business customer.
As one of my branch managers in central London put it recently: 'It's when I
don't hear from customers that I start to worry.' That said, there are many
forms of assistance we can and do give - and we constantly remind customers
to come to their bank manager at the first signs of problems. Peremptory
calling in of borrowing may only lose the bank both its investment and its
customers.

FT  23 APR 91 / Passage from India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Indians massacre villagers', read the headline over a short news item from
my colleague David House-go yesterday. His report, detailing the actions of
Indian security forces in Kashmir, came as a salutary reminder of the
internecine strife, government indecision and financial crises that threaten
the world's most populous democracy. We who watch from afar have naturally
been transfixed by events in the Gulf and the slow disintegration of the
Soviet Union; meanwhile the outlook for India becomes more uncertain.
Kashmir, the only one of India's 25 states with a Moslem majority, is being
held within the republic by military force. In the Punjab a Sikh uprising by
proponents of an independent 'Khalistan' - note how like Kurdistan it sounds
 -appears to be continuing. This is complicated by divisions among the Sikhs
themselves. Militancy has been met with brutality. The slaughter of
innocents by terrorists is evident. Yet the grievances endure; the ideal of
Khalistan will persist even if modified by events. There is also a
continuing undercurrent of revolt in Assam, in the north-east, while in the
enchanting southern state of Tamil Nadu the Tamil Tigers take their
recreation leave from fighting in Sri Lanka by imposing their own will on
parts of their home ground. Clearly the peaceful democracy so well espoused
in London salons by the late Mr Jawaharlal Nehru is not working as well as
it should.
This is hardly surprising. The US has cohesion because its original
settlers, who were overwhelmingly from the British Isles or German-speaking
parts of Europe, created a melting-pot into which later arrivals have to be
poured. It works, if imperfectly. But imagine a federated Europe, stretching
from the Atlantic to the Urals and Stockholm to Naples, in which the Germans
predominated and their language and that of a departed army of
Hindi-speaking conquerors were the two official media of government and
business. In the long run it would not work.
Perhaps what we are seeing in India today is the beginning of the end of the
long run. There was no Indian state before the British created its political
boundaries. The legacy of the Raj was picked up by an educated elite wedded
to the notion of a socialist, secular, permanently unified state. The older
members of this elite still retain England - its language, history and
culture - in their heads; their children less so. The more ambitious among
the governing classes still entertain visions of India's grandeur as the
leader of the non-aligned nations, a senior player upon the world stage,
even a nuclear power.
Reality is eating away at the ideas of Mr Nehru and the founding fathers.
Socialism is increasingly out of fashion in most parts of the world, perhaps
puzzlingly so to some Indians. (There are two Communist parties, which
together have 56 seats in the country's 524-member lower house of
parliament.) Yet for the election due next month Mr Rajiv Gandhi, inheritor
of the leadership of the founding Congress party, is fighting on a manifesto
that promises both a programme of privatisation and a cut in government
spending.
It is hard to maintain the secular ideal. The revivalist Bharatiya Janata
Party, BJP, trades upon the paradoxical feelings among Hindus that although
they are the overwhelming majority they are somehow threatened by Moslems,
Sikhs, and other minorities. This reaches deep into the psyche of many
Hindus. Indian acquaintances of wide erudition and a cosmopolitan mien have
confided to me that they see a point in BJP's proposal to construct a Hindu
temple on a site claimed by Moslems. Mr Gandhi needs Moslem votes and cannot
play the Hindu card, but he has offered a compromise on job reservation for
lower castes, offering to support a scheme without giving figures.
As to national unity and international status, post-war Indian foreign
policy has been firmly based on cementing a special relationship with the
Soviet Union. But now we live in a one-superpower world, and any outside
acquiescence in bloody attempts to repress secessionist movements will
depend upon the US. There is not much point in being non-aligned if there is
no balance of power within which not to align yourself. During the Gulf war
India managed to offend almost every party - its old friends, the Iraqis, by
doing nothing, and its potential business partners, the Americans, by
cutting off overflying rights to refuel at Bombay.
It will be difficult to mend such broken fences until the election produces
a new government, probably a coalition, possibly led by Mr Gandhi. The first
step, however, will be to produce a budget, postponed for electoral reasons,
and the step after that will be to sit down with India's creditors. This is
where outsiders, like the IMF and the World Bank, have some leverage. They
will not provide cash without strings. But how far should conditionality go?
It is in everyone's interest to strengthen Indian democracy, and - as the
Gulf war and its aftermath show - it is the prevailing fashion to maintain
existing boundaries however colonialist their origins. But Indians are
independent-minded people. They need not follow fashion. They would be wise
at least to loosen their tight republic and replace it with a true
federation, or, better, confederation - in short, to decentralise
administration outwards and far away from Delhi.
The new government should state its intentions about economic
liberalisation, and clear its mind about whether it welcomes inward
investment or seeks to drive it away by the sheer weight of obstructive
bureaucracy. I have anecdotal evidence about an Indian mega-millionaire who
made his money in the US and wanted to invest Dollars 250m back home but
withdrew after three months of frustrated attempts to meet the demands of
the Indian civil service. There is a huge wealth of talent and drive among
India's 850m people. They need to shed the remaining burden of the Raj, even
take the risk that in the end some of them go their separate ways, if they
are to realise their potential.

FT  23 APR 91 / Into the air with a hold full of hopes: Martin Dickson on
the outlook for the US aircraft maker McDonnell Douglas as it tries to
recover from a succession of blows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three sleek new airliners, their fresh paint glinting in the spring
Californian sunshine, sit on the 'flight ramp' - the very end of the
production line at McDonnell Douglas's Long Beach plant - surrounded by a
clutter of equipment as workers prepare the jets for final delivery.
They are among the first dozen production models of a wide-bodied,
three-engined jet - the MD-11 - to roll off the commercial aircraft line. To
McDonnell Douglas, these jets, and 34 other MD-11s due for delivery this
year, represent much more than routine aircraft sales. To the management at
Long Beach, where McDonnell makes its civilian aircraft, they provide hope
that the chronic problems that have plagued the plant for years are being
solved. And at the group's headquarters in St Louis, Missouri, the sales are
a kind of financial poetry in motion: each departing Dollars 100m (Pounds
55.8m) jet brings in huge amounts of cash flow which the company believes
will extricate it from a tight corner by the end of this year.
For McDonnell Douglas, the largest defence contractor in the US and one of
the western world's three leading civilian aircraft manufacturers, has a
stretched balance sheet. In 1990 much more cash - some Dollars 400m - flowed
out of the business than came in.
Ironically, just when the company has been basking in the success of its
weapons systems in the Gulf war, a succession of blows has left some
Pentagon officials and industry observers questioning whether it could even
become a contender for bankruptcy or a government bail-out.
Mr John McDonnell, the company's bearded, 53-year-old chairman and the son
of its founder, says the Cassandras are just plain wrong. 'We've taken a lot
of strong measures to improve cash flow and they are taking effect,' he
says. 'By the end of this year our cash flow will be getting quite positive
and our debt will be going down, and it will be obvious to everyone that
we're getting in a much stronger financial situation.'
But in 1990 the company reported net earnings of only Dollars 306m on
revenues of Dollars 16bn, while at year-end its debts, excluding its
financing arm, totalled Dollars 3bn, or 95 per cent of its equity. Nor is
the quality of its earnings very impressive: some Dollars 376m of 1990
profits came from a one-time pensions settlement, while the company is in
dispute with the government over military contracts which could eventually
mean writing off hundreds of millions of dollars.
The most serious dispute stems from January's decision by Mr Dick Cheney,
the US defence secretary, to cancel development of the A-12 attack aircraft,
a potential Dollars 50bn programme being jointly developed by McDonnell
Douglas and General Dynamics. The two contractors, having already taken
large write-offs on the A-12, are now locked in litigation over Dollars
1.3bn of progress payments which the Pentagon wants back.
Even if McDonnell's finances are now improving, with a reported profit of
Dollars 58m for the three months to March 31 this year, against only Dollars
2m for a year earlier, it faces a difficult long-term juggling act: its
combat aircraft business, which for years has made up for the weak financial
performance of the commercial side, is shrinking inexorably as the US cuts
its defence budget.
The Gulf war is unlikely to bring in much fresh business - apart from a
replenishment of the Tomahawk cruise missiles. And while McDonnell remains
the leading US manufacturer of combat aircraft, several models - the F-15
Eagle, the Harrier II AV-8B and the Apache helicopter - are nearing the end
of their Pentagon production programmes.
An announcement is expected today on the air force's choice to succeed the
F-15. The contenders are a Northrop-McDonnell partnership and one comprising
Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics. Worth Dollars 64.6bn, according to
the Pentagon, the contract for the advanced tactical fighter, the ATF, is
vital to McDonnell Douglas. This month it lost out to a rival
Boeing-Sikorsky consortium for the US army's new light attack helicopter
contract.
Whichever way the ATF contest is decided, it is clear that McDonnell's
future is becoming more dependent on Long Beach and its ability to develop
profitably new generations of civilian aircraft in competition against the
larger, more efficient Boeing and European Airbus Industrie.
Long Beach, in common with rival manufacturers, has a strong order-book  -
particularly for wide-bodied jets - though in recent months the industry has
become nervous because of deferrals and cancellations by airline customers.
But the plant has been an Achilles heel since the Californian Douglas
company merged with McDonnell in 1967, losing money for much of the past 15
years.
Its profits record might be blamed in part on the competitive pressures of
the aerospace industry, but insiders suggest it results substantially from
years of poor productivity and lack of discipline. The plant's management
did not have a sufficient grasp on real production costs, while suppliers
complained about bureaucracy and inefficiency in the purchasing system.
All these problems were exacerbated in the mid-1980s as Long Beach tried to
cope not only with making the aircraft it already had in production - the
MD-80 twin-engine jet and the now discontinued DC-10 wide-bodied aircraft -
but also with a rush of new developments: there was the MD-11, the successor
to the DC-10; the MD-90, a follow-on from the MD-80; the C-17, a new
generation of military transport aircraft specially designed for use on
short runways; and the T45, a naval training aircraft.
Despite these new ventures, McDonnell Douglas's family of commercial
aircraft is less comprehensive than that of Boeing and the developing Airbus
fleet. Unlike its two principal competitors, it has no presence in the
middle range of the market, but is concentrated at the lower end, with the
MD-80, and at the top with the MD-11. McDonnell and Airbus missed a chance
to challenge Boeing two years ago by failing to agree to co-operate on new
aircraft production. Now McDonnell is understood to be actively looking for
an equity partner to buy a minority stake in the commercial jet side of the
business.
Meanwhile, as the company struggled to meet its commercial aircraft
commitments and programmes, staff levels were rising. At Long Beach, the
workforce went from just 12,000 in 1982 to 52,000 in 1989. As it did the
experience level of the average worker dropped from 10 years to two.
Problems multiplied and the plant's development schedule lagged.
At this point Mr McDonnell, who became chairman in early 1988, decided that
the entire group needed a radical overhaul of its management systems. A new
executive team, drawn from across the company, was despatched to Long Beach
last year, headed by Mr Bob Hood. The new management approach aims to
improve productivity and customer satisfaction by stripping away
bureaucracy, pushing greater powers of decision-making down the line, and
creating greater motivation and inter-departmental co-operation through the
formation of teams. Called Total Quality Management System (TQMS), and
inspired by the Japanese, it has been adopted by several other leading US
manufacturers.
'We started from ground zero,' recalls Mr Hood. Departments were reshaped
into teams working on individual products, drawing together people from
different disciplines. Management layers were cut from nine to five and the
new leaders were selected with an emphasis on what Mr Hood calls their
ability to 'coach and listen' rather than 'old-style dictatorial
management'.
Over the longer term, the changes may well prove to be the salvation of Long
Beach. In the short term, they produced more confusion, demoralisation and
delays. TQMS was introduced gradually and quite successfully at McDonnell's
St Louis division, but was imposed virtually overnight at Long Beach.
Matters became so bad that Colonel Kenneth Tollefson, the air force
representative overseeing the C-17 programme, wrote an article in the staff
newspaper accusing management of lack of leadership.
Morale at the plant still seems shaky, and union relations delicate, but
over the past year progress on the MD-80 and MD-11 lines does suggest that
the shake-up is starting to produce better results. For example,
productivity on the MD-80 improved by more than 30 per cent in 1990 and is
still getting better. For the first time in its history that aircraft has
enjoyed two consecutive money-making quarters, with a third coming up.
All this has not saved the MD-11 from some recent embarrassing criticism
from Mr Robert Crandall, the chairman of American Airlines, who was unhappy
with the first aircraft delivered to his company. Mr Crandall's complaints
seem to involve some easily fixable and relatively minor glitches, and
American says the problems do not alter its enthusiasm for the MD-11.
A far larger Long Beach dispute, which could have a significant impact on
the group's profits and balance sheet, concerns the C-17, which is behind
schedule and looks likely to come in over the Dollars 6.6bn fixed-price
contract McDonnell Douglas accepted from the air force. The air force,
claiming that McDonnell is Dollars 500m above the ceiling, withheld progress
payments late last year and Pentagon officials were recently quoted as
saying that the project might now be Dollars 800m to Dollars 900m over
budget.
McDonnell, however, reckons the aircraft will come in only Dollars 100m
above the ceiling. Mr Herb Lanese, the company's senior vice-president,
finance, says the two sides are working on new figures and insists that 'the
performance indicators at this time are a lot closer to our numbers than to
the air force's'.
The Pentagon's withholding of Dollars 900m last year for work on the C-17
and the cancelled A-12 has contributed significantly to McDonnell's cash
squeeze, as has the tightness of the capital markets, restricting cheap
access to funds for a company with a low investment-grade credit rating. But
the main factor has been the Dollars 3bn cost of developing the MD-11 -
roughly the same as the group's entire equity base.
However, Mr Lanese says the financial picture is on the point of improving
substantially and that March probably saw the peak of the company's
borrowing needs. At the end of the first quarter McDonnell's debt totalled
about Dollars 3.3bn, with some Dollars 370m of cash on hand, against net
equity of Dollars 3.5bn. With loan covenants setting a ceiling of just over
Dollars 4bn on total borrowings, the company still has a sizeable ability to
raise funds.
The improving cash position is due in part to MD-11 sales but also to a
company-wide savings drive: working capital is being slashed, the dividend
has been reduced and capital spending curtailed. The MD-11 production
schedule has also been cut - by five aircraft this year, from 42 to 37,
helping save on parts and labour costs.
All this does suggest that the direst predictions are overdone. That said,
McDonnell's room for manoeuvre will remain tight for the rest of this year,
and there are several wild cards - a Dollars 500m tax claim, the C-17 and
labour issues - which could yet cause it severe headaches.
Next year cash flow is likely to turn positive, but the heat will still be
on McDonnell's management: to improve Long Beach productivity; to find funds
to develop the next wide-bodied jet - a stretched version of the MD-11
called the MD-12X which will compete with the Boeing 747-400; and to handle
the tricky transfer of resources from fighter to commercial aircraft.

FT  23 APR 91 / Leading Article: Listening to employees
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE seeking a lesson in the most productive ways to manage workers would
be unlikely to look first to Britain. Failure to engage the skills and
commitment of workers effectively has been a longstanding problem for
industry. In the 1970s, the symptom of this British disease was industrial
action. In the 1990s, it is unemployment caused by inability to contain wage
growth.
Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, nonetheless believes Britain
has a story to tell. He yesterday praised companies for promoting employee
involvement. Instead of following rigid European practice, companies were
finding their own ways of raising productivity through worker involvement.
Mr Howard's point is that British companies are already addressing this
tricky issue without having to be forced to do so by the European
Commission. He suggested that the Council of Ministers accepts a vaguely
worded endorsement of worker participation in place of the Commission's
draft directive on European works councils. This would avoid large employers
having to establish European consultation mechanisms.
Part of Mr Howard's motive was no doubt political. The government has played
on its resistance to what it regards as the Commission's plan to smother the
Single European Market in the red tape of the social action programme. Mr
John Major has less taste for such public carping than Mrs Thatcher, but Mr
Howard believes he is on firm ground, given the undoubted hostility of
British employers to the draft directive.
Overblown rhetoric
The political motivation accounts for some of the overblown rhetoric.
Companies employing more than 1,000 people and more than 100 in at least two
EC countries would no doubt find it irritating to have to pay for regular
pan-European briefing meetings. Many might question their value, but the
directive would hardly force them into full-blown co-determination.
One reason why the fears appear exaggerated is the long history of the
directive. It is a descendant of more ambitious attempts to impose worker
participation, including the Vredeling directive of 1980. But its roots are
misleading: the European Commission no longer sees itself applying the
German model across the Community. Most of today's debate revolves around
the entirely valid objective of increasing managerial effectiveness and
corporate success.
Code of practice
Mr Howard could do more to catch this mood. For example a code of practice
on employee involvement has already been drawn up by the Institute of
Personnel Management and the Involvement and Participation Association. Mr
Howard should consider endorsing it.
But such signals of encouragement to employee involvement are the limit of
what governments should do. Legislation is not the right way to define or
enforce good management practice. This is as true of employee communication
as it is of the structure of company boards or the planning of a production
line. Inflexible models of how managers should inform workers will not
increase good communication.
Much of this legislative intent at the European level is, in any case,
clearly outdated. Not only European governments, but US management
consultants now preach the virtues of involving employees in production
systems and quality control; wise managements keep workers informed and
listen to what they say. Japanese team-working methods and quality circles
are among the clearest pieces of evidence that worker involvement can bring
a financial pay-off.
The market is thus already deciding in favour of involvement. Changes in
working methods to suit more complex production processes are already making
it more difficult to sustain a clear divide between managers and the
managed. This is something for governments to encourage if they want to
achieve economic success. It cannot be imposed through inflexible
legislation, no matter how well intentioned.

FT  23 APR 91 / Arts: Snowy wastes focus the mind - William Packer on the
Canadian exhibition at the Barbican
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The True North is the self-consciously evocative, not to say portentous
title of the exhibition that now fills the upper tier of the Barbican Art
Gallery (until June 16: sponsored by The Daily Telegraph and Air Canada).
But while its sub-title, 'Canadian landscape painting 1896 - 1939', might
well give us pause, with thoughts inevitable of something more frozen, dull
and provincial than exciting, for once the more hopeful expectation is not
disappointed. As is so often the case with national schools, Canadian
painting has been for far too long too well-kept a secret, to the general
loss. What the Barbican now offers us is quite simply, within its own terms,
as intriguing and physically enjoyable a show of well-made, honest paintings
as we could wish for.
The study of art is littered in paradox, not the least of them that which
suggests that the more national, even local the work might be, the wider its
general interest and significance. So steeped are we in the idea of Paris as
the very heart of modernism through all its earlier phases, that we too
easily accept that franco-centric reading at its own self-valuation, seeing
everything else as but second-hand, second-best and provincial. But, paradox
again, Paris was indeed at the heart of things, and artists came from across
the world to see and respond to what was being done, and measure their own
art by its standards.
The traffic was ever all ways, and in the first decades of this century many
of these expatriates clearly held much in common in that was quite distinct
from Paris. The more worldly and knowing, the more true to themselves they
were. The Canadians were no exception in this, but they might as well have
been Scots or Scandinavians, Spaniards or Mexicans, Americans or even
Japanese. The mistake was only to forget, or rather discount the fact that
artists went on working wherever they were, thinking of home when they were
in Paris, and quite often remembering Paris when they were home.
But while this question of national self-identity is common-place, it is
true that it has concerned Canadians to a peculiar degree. The looming,
over-bearing presence of the US, the sense of existing along a narrow
southern fringe with, at their back, the immense wilderness stretching
endlessly away to the Farthest North, has always concentrated their minds
wonderfully. In their artists it must surely account for the often
self-consciously exhortatory quality of their writings, urging each other
towards a position that is truly Canadian; for the constant groupings and
regroupings of clubs and societies; and above all, for the epic and
celebratory aspect of so much of the work in this exhibition. This last
especially is a quality held in common with certain of the contemporary
Scandinavian and Icelandic painters, but here so much more forceful and
intense.
The show begins with the work of the young artists who were in Paris well
before the turn of the century, where they they were able to respond
directly to impressionism in its later moods and phases, and to early
developments in post-impressionism. These are not the most dramatic images,
but their accomplishment and sophistication are incontestable, two views of
1906 by Maurice Cullen, across the St Lawrence river to and from Quebec, as
subtle and exquisite in their suggestive tonality as any Monet, and the most
beautiful in the entire show. Suzor-Cote, Clarence Gagnon and James Morrice,
make up this first most distinctive and distinguished group.
But the best known group, and indeed central to the whole study of Canadian
painting in the early 20th century, is the Group of Seven, which came
together informally in the 1910s and formally constituted itself just after
the Great War. With certain individual artists loosely associated with it,
such as Tom Thomson who died in 1917 and, much later, Emily Carr, it
addressed itself consciously to the landscape not merely as a visible
phenomenon, but as a moral force.
In the work of all the Seven: Harris, MacDonald, Lismer, Jackson, Varley,
Johnston and Carmichael, the landscape takes on an almost mystical presence,
not personal exactly but alive in its physicality, the space across the
lake, the form over the mountain febrile in definition, fraught with
feeling. Cloud, mountain, lake and forest alike are simplified and
celebrated almost as symbol and totem, the individual tree or rock itself
become a monument. But there is rather more to it than simple symbolic
signification. The works are beautifully painted, and with a raw but
contained energy in the drawing, and rich paint on the surface. Landscape,
image and experience alike are beautifully observed, realised and felt.
As much is true of the work of Tom Thomson, perhaps more so, which is as
impressive as anything here, though shown separately by the accident of his
early death. If the exhibition does nothing more than establish his wider
reputation, it will have been worthwhile.
The show is rounded off by the later work of those artists who continued, by
Emily Carr's overt symbolism, by younger artists such as Charles Comfort,
and by perhaps the most idiosyncratic and particular of them all, David
Milne, whose delicately mannered touch exquisitely combines any number of
modernisms, from impressionism on.
Back to the Seven for a moment, Arthur Lismer and Frederick Varley were both
from Sheffield and their work is the subject of a coincidental exhibition,
Our Home and Native Land, organised by the Sheffield City Art Galleries,
which comes to Canada House next month (May 3 to June 18). Showing them as
it does in depth, it is a necessary pendant to this Barbican exhibition.
Un-Natural Traces, which fills the Barbican's lower gallery, is a
complementary show of current Canadian art.

FT  23 APR 91 / Arts: Robert Wilson's 'Night before the Day' - Paula Deitz
on the American director's latest presentation: a retrospective exhibition
of his work together with his new production, Ibsen's 'When we Dead Awaken'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAULA DEITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Wilson, the theatre director, writer, designer and artist, was born
in Waco, Texas, lives in New York City, and has preferred to work in Berlin,
Paris and other cultural capitals of Europe. During the past season, though,
Boston and Cambridge have provided the artist, who will be 50 this year,
with two opportunities for world premieres that will travel across the
country. They mark a new stage in his career.
Wilson's stock-in-trade is to give concrete form to a combination of
visionary images and gestures gleaned from daily observation. Placed in a
theatrical, indeed operatic setting, these fragments are made to cohere by a
third ingredient - the attention and imagination of his audience.
In many ways, he is closer to Wagner than Ionesco, for though the absurd may
be buried in the material, it is the epic themes and variations,
repetitiously unfurled during long performances like those of Einstein on
the Beach, that shape the disjointed parts into a memorable whole. And even
where a performance may lag, there is the architecture of the set and his
painterly use of light that make the experience more than just a worthwhile
representation.
At the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Robert Wilson's Vision, the first
retrospective of the artist's work in a decade, is as much a performance as
an exhibition. And across the Charles River in Cambridge, the American
Repertory Theatre at Harvard premiered Wilson's production of Henrik Ibsen's
last play, When We Dead Awaken, which will now be moving with the exhibition
to Houston, Texas, and, one would hope, to other cities here and abroad.
As is often the case, an outside discipline can channel creativity into
unusual depths, and here an 1899 play (Wilson usually writes his own
scripts), whose symbolist themes are compatible with Wilson's techniques,
has given the director a chance to cut loose in amazing ways. Not the least
of these are the inclusion of some hauntingly beautiful blues songs,
composed and sung by tap dancer Charles 'Honi' Coles, sometimes with the
whole cast, during the 'Knee Plays', the brief performances in the intervals
that are the joints between the acts. Both the exhibition and the play are
accompanied by sound environments composed by Wilson's longtime
collaborator, Hans Peter Kuhn.
In designing the exhibition, a work of installation art in itself, Wilson
created a journey through three major galleries that, like any classical
drama, suggests the passage of a single day. 'The Night before the Day,' as
he calls the installation, features objects and furniture used as props,
drawings, paintings, maquettes and actual sets from his past productions.
The entrance through a long dark corridor sounds like a wind tunnel with
distant bird calls and leads to a room the colour of dawn, where, among
other objects, his hanging wire mesh chairs and tables are doubled by their
perfect shadows on the walls. Such objects as the Japanese-style puppets,
used in 'Knee Plays' during CIVIL WarS, and the glass and neon light bulb
from Death Destruction and Detroit are elegant in themselves though somehow
denuded of their active stage roles.
More illuminating are the black-and-white drawings of his stage designs that
convey with solid and luminously transparent planes the great sense of stage
distance he achieves. One drawing, for 'A Letter for Queen Victoria,'
demonstrates how something as simple as the back of an envelope can inspire
the diagonals of his stage design. The final gallery, dark as night, is
aglow with the moving lights of the grid - like the interior of the
spaceship from the climax of Einstein on the Beach: being so close to it
fulfils an audience fantasy of wanting to be in it.
Having recently seen a more traditional production of When We Dead Awaken
performed by the Jean Cocteau Repertory in New York, I am convinced that
Wilson has given a more thoughtful and penetrating interpretation of this
enigmatic play, which Ibsen saw as the epilogue of his previous works. The
new translation is by Robert Brustein, the ART's artistic director.
Rubek, the famous but ageing sculptor who attempts to rekindle his creative
spark, rejects his young, earthy but boring wife, Maya, for a kind of
spiritual meeting with the model, Irene, who inspired his greatest work and
who may or may not be alive. The sets of mountainous seaside scenes, with
rivers of glass and glacial peaks are realistic enough and make one sense
the starkness of the terrain. The 'music' of clanking metal and roaring sea
evokes a desolate landscape as well. But the constructions, as of a metal
cage cum labyrinth where Irene and her keeper, here her inner self, take
interminable walks, add to the psychological force of the dialogue.
The sets and costumes recall the sombre beauty of 19th-century Scandinavian
landscape and figure painting. Wilson has hewed to the force of the script
and each act takes his audience higher into the mountains in a natural
ascent to the fatal avalanche. The line from Charles 'Honi' Coles' first
song - 'I was alone when I met her/ Now I wish I was alone' - becomes a good
refrain for the play.
When We Dead Awaken will be presented by the Alley Theatre in Houston,
Texas, May 22 - May 26. Robert Wilson's Vision will go on exhibit in Houston
at the Contemporary Arts Museum, June 15 - August 18 and at the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art, September 12 - December 1. AT&amp;T is the
corporate sponsor.

FT  23 APR 91 / Arts: Prokofiev symphonies - Royal Festival Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most interesting features of the current 'Russian Spring' series
on South Bank is the programming on two weekends of all seven Prokofiev
symphonies. This is much rarer than it ought to be; and even individually,
the fortunes of the symphonies are mixed - the First ('Classical') and Fifth
are played a lot, the Sixth slightly less often, and the remaining four very
little.
In addition, the chance to hear the seven given in chronological order, as
the two BBC Philharmonic weekends allow, tells one a great deal not only
about the development of an important composer, but much that is central to
the whole notion of a 'Russian Spring' in music. For, while Prokofiev may
not have been a revolutionary composer in any committed ideological sense,
it is in his brilliant, audacious, and copious musical outpourings that we
come to appreciate most fully the trends of the immediate pre and
post-Revolutionary period.
The BBC Philharmonic under Edward Downes played the 'Classical' and the
Second on Saturday evening (separated by Nikolay Demidenko's superlatively
fine account, technically impeccable, formidable, sparklingly witty, of the
First Piano Concerto) and the Third and Fourth on Sunday afternoon (the rest
follow, in similar programme divisions and timings, next weekend). The
'Classical' (1916-17) is a jeu d'esprit indicative of the saucy wit and love
of 18th-century forms and counterpoint that would stamp Prokofiev all his
life. But from there to the Second is a big, fascinating step; and under
Downes's sympathetic and knowledgeable guidance it was rewarding to be able
to take it.
The following three works, all scored for gigantic forces, are stepchildren
of the repertory; the Second (1924-5), a piece of steel-and-smoke musical
machinery unparalleled in Prokofiev's output, is the most neglected and
misunderstood of the trio - unsuccessful at its Paris premiere, apt to be
dismissively viewed even now.
The title of Mossolov's notorious short ballet, Iron Foundry, could with
some aptness serve as its subtitle, though in the second movement, a set of
theme and variations, there is relief, of a quietly and mysteriously
beautiful kind, from the pounding, braying and chains of dissonances (all of
which Downes and his orchestra clarified with masterly patience).
The Second is not exactly a decorous or tidy piece of symphonic construction
(Prokofiev never got round to revising or re-scoring it, as he planned). But
in a carefully considered performance such as we heard on Saturday, the
wealth of combative, rhythmically intricate, densely vibrant material it
contains can knock an audience sideways.
The next two symphonies gained their existence via a different route: both
are re-thinkings of existent material, the one operatic, the other balletic,
and so it is understandable that both, while no less thunderous at climaxes,
should be cleaner and trimmer in their proportions. And both, in their
different and more mature ways, seem to mark the most artistically striking
point of balance between the 'iconoclastic' Prokofiev and the 'popular'.
Both contain extraordinarily rich and exciting invention: their blends of
sounds and harmonies - intense, pungent, and sweepingly lyrical by turns -
are like no other I know. The Third (1928) is the symphony that Prokofiev
drew from the opera The Fiery Angel (which Downes will be conducting - happy
news] - at Covent Garden in two seasons' time); the Fourth (1929-30, revised
1947) is an adaptation and extension of material from the ballet The
Prodigal Son.
Whether or not Prokofiev was a symphonist in the traditionally understood
sense is a question that has been hotly debated before, and will no doubt be
again; but it seems to me that, particularly in the Third, with its
depiction of worlds earthly and demonic, of states of mind 'normal' and
wildly out of kilter, a discourse of confronted opposites is very much in
the fabric of its four movements. While the Fourth does not grip the
listener in quite the same way, the diversity of its sound-worlds -
comic-pastoral, sparkishly jazzy, and broadly melodic - is even more
immediate in its appeal.
I formed the impression, perhaps unjustly, that of all the works on the bill
of the first BBCPO weekend, the Fourth had been the one least precisely
prepared. There were patches of scrappy ensemble, and it was here that one
noticed most often the orchestra's relative narrowness of string tone (the
brass played expertly throughout). But in Downes's hands, lack of orchestral
inflation was an interpretative feature, and a wholly positive one, of both
concerts: while performances of more extravagantly virtuosic, or 'Russian',
characterisation are easily imagined, those of more musicianly style and
substance can hardly be. On to next weekend]

No generation in English history had more influence on the way we lead our
lives today than those who lived in the first half of the 17th century. From
the winning of the initiative by the House of Commons via the civil war,
with the defeat and execution of the king in 1649, to the Cromwellian
Commonwealth, it was a period packed with crucial incident.
It can be argued that it was the earliness of their 'revolution' which gave
the English such a stable constitutional life for the next 300 years.
Channel 4 starts a 6-part series on England's Civil War (8.30).
ITV starts a second series of the entertaining drama Chancer (9.00) about
the cockney yuppie Stephen Crane. BBC2 begins a six-part documentary series
about the British experience of sex in the first half of this century: A
Secret World Of Sex (9.50). Under the Mental Defectives Act of 1913 young
women could be locked away in mental homes if they had illegitimate babies,
and for many the annual seaside holiday was one of the few opportunities for
sexual activity.

FT  23 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Sleepy Commons takes on funereal
atmosphere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRIME-time debate in the Commons on the funeral industry is not a normal
feature of parliamentary life. Coupled with rumours, which began immediately
MPs reassembled after a fortnight's Easter recess, of a two-week break at
Whitsun, it produced a feeling at Westminster that the session had
effectively turned up its toes.
Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, is quick to dispel such ideas.
Parliament is dealing with more bills this session than in both the two
previous years, he says, and the government is carrying through a heavy
legislative programme. Yesterday's debate was a routine occasion for a
backbencher's choice of subject.
Mr MacGregor points out that so far 34 bills have been launched in the
1990-91 session, compared with 26 in the 1989-90 period and 30 the year
before.
In terms of controversy and length, the picture is slightly different.
The Commons will indeed be disposing of four bills this week, but
discussions on bills dealing with Scottish natural heritage and the atomic
weapons establishment are unlikely to attract full houses.
Every year has some politically inconsequential measures, such as the
Overseas Superannuation Bill which the Commons passed almost without
noticing, but most sessions have blockbusters as well.
Only the Criminal Justice Bill this year is comparable with heavyweights
such as last year's legislation on broadcasting, environmental issues and
health service reforms.
Alongside the deliberate pre-election mix of bills, MPs are also benefiting
from Mr MacGregor's positive management of the programme.
In refusing to allow his colleagues to hijack bills and expand them to
overflow the time provided, and in creating special committees to leave most
European Community legislation to the enthusiasts, he has lightened two
traditional scourges of backbenchers in search of more time with their
families.
Outside factors have also helped. Ministers mention MPs' pre-occupation with
the Gulf, and with local government elections and finance. The most
effective distraction, however, was the one that dares not speak its name -
the Tory leadership contest in November.
While the Tory party went through the most dramatic political events in most
politicians' memories, in just a fortnight, the Commons went through all
stages of three bills and the second readings of five others.
Even after Mrs Thatcher's departure, politics continued to dominate over
government. It would not have been the way of expediting legislation that
the government would have chosen, but it certainly worked.
Its effect has been to end the business managers' annual nightmare of ranks
of MPs increasingly bad-tempered and tied to Westminster by three-line whips
through long, hot July evenings.
Instead, in order to avoid both the opposite trap of devilish work being
found for idle hands and the charge of running out of steam, ministers are
emphasising the amount of business still to be done.
They acknowledge privately, however, that MPs have largely lost interest in
legislation, with the possible exception of the Finance Bill. 'They're just
looking to the election now,' said one cabinet minister.

FT  23 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Chalker to press United Nations to
play much more active role - Kurdish refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is to press the United Nations to inject a greater sense of urgency
into the direction of its relief programme for the Iraqi refugees on the
Turkish border and in Iran.
Mrs Lynda Chalker, minister for overseas development, clearly shocked by the
'horrendous' conditions she saw for herself at the end of last week, is to
make urgent representations at the UN headquarters in New York.
She will see Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the UN secretary general, today. Mr
Douglas Hogg, foreign office minister of state, will have parallel talks in
Geneva with Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the UN delegate in charge of the
refugee programme in Iraq and Kuwait.
Mrs Chalker warned the Commons yesterday that the role of British troops in
creating safe havens for the Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq would extend
over 'several months'. She called on the UN to play 'a much more active role
right away'.
She made it clear that, if necessary, she would go beyond normal diplomatic
niceties to ensure that Mr Perez de Cuellar was in no doubt about Britain's
concern.
Mrs Chalker, who acknowledged that local UN representatives were making
strenuous efforts, stressed: 'It is at the centre and the top where me must
get things sorted out.'
Describing the plight of the Iraqi refugees as 'truly harrowing' she said
the assistance being provided was greater for those on the Turkish border
than for those in Iran.
She announced that Britain would make an initial contribution of Pounds 2m
to help the refugees in Iran, from the Pounds 20m programme pledged by Mr
John Major, the prime minister.
Britain wants the UN and other international agencies to join in a drive to
at least double the rate of delivery of supplies for the refugees.
MRS CHALKER rejected Labour charges that she had been wrong to link efforts
to secure the release of British hostages held in the Lebanon with the
provision of aid for the refugees.
She insisted she had not linked the two issues, but claimed she would have
been open to criticism if she had not referred to Britain's anxiety to
secure the hostages' earliest possible release.

FT  23 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Full circle for Thatcher's nemesis
 -Philip Stephens on Michael Heseltine's replacement for the poll tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BACK in 1981 when Mrs Margaret Thatcher first pushed for the abolition of
domestic rates, Mr Michael Heseltine offered a simple solution to her most
pressing concern.
The then environment secretary told the then prime minister that if her main
worry was the high bills faced by little old ladies living alone in large
houses, the answer was simple. He would make local authorities give them a
big discount.
The rest is history. Mrs Thatcher did not take his advice. Mr Heseltine
moved on and then out of the Cabinet. The prime minister solved her problem
by replacing the rates with the poll tax. Mr Heseltine pushed her out of
Downing Street.
Today Mr Heseltine, back at environment under a new prime minister, will
outline his plan to replace the poll tax with a property tax which provides
a 25 per cent discount to little old ladies living alone in large houses.
The important details have already emerged; and despite of talk of further
consultation, the scheme will represent a firm proposal rather than an
option.
At first glance it looks a neat synthesis of political imperatives and
economic logic, though the realistic in Whitehall are still unsure of how
strong the joins are.
The tax will be levied on property classified in seven bands according to
capital value. Bills will be applied to households - with an assumption that
they contain two adults - rather than to individuals. The poorest will be
exempted entirely.
The present system of grant distribution using Standard Spending Assessments
will remain as will draconian 'capping' powers to prevent 'excessive'
spending by local authorities. There is little talk nowadays of preserving
'local democracy'.
The economic logic is there in the fact that a property tax restores some
relationship between individual wealth and the size of bills. The Duke in
his stately home will pay more than the dustman in his council flat. The
Treasury, which has always regarded property values as a reasonable proxy
for income, is satisfied. So too are the politicians who can claim this
makes the tax 'fair', or at least much fairer than the poll tax. All single
adults, including the famous little old lady, will get a 25 per cent
discount.
The political compromise reveals itself in the decision to compress and then
'cap' the increases in bills which can be applied to the different bands.
The government will set the bands nationally along with strict 'multipliers'
to regulate the proportion of revenue raised from properties in each
category.
Most importantly, the bill for a house worth, say, Pounds 1m or more in band
7 will not be more than 2.5 times higher than for the flat worth Pounds
40,000 in band 1. So the system will be progressive - about 90 per cent of
households will be unaffected by the 'cap' on band 7 - but, like the present
income tax structure, only up to a point.
Mr Heseltine hopes this compromise will calm Tory fears that a return to any
property tax would automatically create a swathe of 'losers' in the south.
The Budget switch of more than Pounds 4bn of local taxation to VAT should
ensure that average bills across the country should not be much more than
Pounds 350 per household. The multipliers will prevent councils from loading
the burden on to southern Tory voters who have benefited from the sharp rise
in property values over the past decade.
Bills for similar properties will not be identical across the country. A
three-bedroom semi in London will typically be in a higher band that a
similar house in Barnsley, so will attract a higher bill. The Treasury
thinks it should - incomes are higher in London than Barnsley. But the
politicians will control the size of the differential.
It all looks ingenious, and ministers are convinced that it will work. This
time, they insist, the Treasury is fully behind the new system. It has been
tested on the computers in Great George Street as well as those in Marsham
Street.
There is even a fig-leaf for those still wedded to the principle that all
should contribute to the cost of local services. Mr Heseltine will argue
that the two-person household assumed by the tax will capture 38m of the 42m
adults theoretically liable to pay the poll.
There is still, though, one serious weakness. Whatever the initial level of
bills, the commitment to the Uniform Business Rate means that any local tax
will be highly 'geared'. A 10 per cent rise in spending beyond that allowed
for in government grant would produce a 70 per cent rise in bills. More than
one senior minister is convinced that the UBR cannot survive in its present
form. But talk of raising the tax burden on industry is for after, not
before, the general election.

THE Bruges group, the Tory-dominated organisation opposed to a Federal
Europe, last night reprimanded Mr Patrick Robertson, its secretary, for
issuing a statement earlier this month attacking the leadership style of Mr
John Major.
The group stopped short, however, of accepting his offer to resign - leading
to claims from some Conservatives that the group remained discredited. Mr
Major was accused in the statement of 'wobbling' and of engaging in gesture
politics over the Kurdish issue.
At a special meeting, the group approved a tightening of rules for issuing
statements on behalf of the group. Mr Robertson and Dr Alan Sked, who helped
draft the comments, offered 'an unqualified expression of regret'.

FT  23 APR 91 / Cathay will operate flights from Heathrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CATHAY PACIFIC will on May 1 become the second international airline to
offer its first services from London's Heathrow airport. The move follows
the government's decision to open Heathrow, the world's busiest
international passenger airport, to all carriers.
The start of Cathay's daily non-stop service between Heathrow and Hong Kong
will increase competition for British Airways at its home base of Heathrow.
Mr John Dance, Cathay's UK manager, said it was important for the airline to
operate from Heathrow as well as Gatwick to match BA's services. Heathrow
would give Cathay access to about 50 per cent of the UK market.
BA is already in competition with United Airlines for transatlantic
services. United started flights to Heathrow this month after winning
approval to take over Pan Am's London services.
A total of 10 international airlines, barred up to now from operating from
Heathrow, have successfully applied for rights to start services at London's
leading airport.
Royal Brunei will launch a twice-weekly service on May 7 from Heathrow to
Bandar Seri Begawan stopping at Dubai and Singapore.
Virgin Atlantic, Korean Airlines and All Nippon Airways are among airlines
planning new Heathrow services this summer.
These services are expected to lead to a fierce war on fares and promotions
between airlines vying for passengers in a depressed air-travel market.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, warned that the airline's
passenger volume was not expected to recover to levels reached before the
Gulf war until September or October. BA's traffic fell 13.2 per cent in
March compared with March 1990.
Mr Dance said Cathay intended to match all the promotions and lower fares
offered by BA, but added: 'I hope when we get to the peak season, there will
be a bit more sense seen by carriers.'

FT  23 APR 91 / Slowdown in managers' pay rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RATE of increase in the total pay of managers slowed slightly in the
first quarter of 1991, leaving them on schedule for an increase of 13 per
cent for the full year.
That is the finding of the executive pay index produced by Noble Lowndes,
management consultants and actuaries.
The index, which includes the value of fringe benefits such as cars and
pensions as well as salaries and bonuses, is calculated quarterly for the
Financial Times. The latest figure is based on a survey of 5,085 managers in
396 companies throughout the UK.
In the first quarter the average total pay for all ranks of executives rose
by 3.3 per cent to Pounds 71,633.
The rise compares with a 3.5 per cent increase for the first three months of
1990 and a rise for the whole of last year of 13.8 per cent.
Although total pay increased, the recession was reflected by a decline in
the element made up of incentive bonuses to an average of Pounds 4,242 at
the start of this month, against Pounds 4,369 in early Jan-uary.
The salary element increased by 3.3 per cent to Pounds 50,771, the average
value of company cars by 4 per cent to Pounds 8,329, pension entitlements by
5.8 per cent to Pounds 7,014, and other benefits by 7.3 per cent to Pounds
1,277.

FT  23 APR 91 / Abta warns of delay in refunds when tour companies collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOOLS which had booked holidays through companies that later collapsed may
have to wait up to three months for a refund, according to the Association
of British Travel Agents.
Mr David Hurst, Abta's head of public affairs, said schools should apply to
Abta for their money and then book their trips again, rather than assign
their refunds to other companies.
Some schools are confused about how to respond to other companies, some
non-Abta, offering to take over trips which had been booked with failed
operators.
Abta has so far received 200 claims from customers of Adventure Travel
International (ATI), which ceased trading at the end of March, and a similar
number for Adventure Express, an un-related company which has also ceased
trading. The failure of Sun Living, a school tours group that went into
liquidation in February, has led to 1,000 claims.
The Earl of Scarborough High School at Skegness, Lincolnshire, has been
caught in the failures of two tour companies since February, and is awaiting
more than Pounds 20,000 in refunds from Abta. ATI's receiver has written a
letter saying the school remains 'principally liable' for a further Pounds
7,625.
According to Abta, the school will eventually receive its refund and should
not have to pay anything to the receiver. Mr Jim Whittaker, the school's
headmaster, said he planned to veto future group holidays.
The school had booked three holidays with Sun Living. Within an hour of the
announcement that the company had collapsed, Mr Whittaker received a call
from ATI offering to take over the planned trips on identical terms and
without further payment. With one group due to leave at the end of that
week, Mr Whittaker instructed Abta to pay the refund direct to ATI. Although
the holiday took place, it was 'substantially defective', he said.
The other two parties never boarded their coaches. In spite of its previous
undertaking, Mr Whittaker said, ATI asked for additional cash if the trips
were to proceed. He had to get an emergency payment of Pounds 13,066 from
Lincolnshire County Council.
Mr Whittaker said ATI assured him on March 28 that the groups would leave
the next day as planned. He learned three hours later that the company had
ceased trading.
'We have incurred considerable administrative costs in organising holidays
and dealing with cancellations for which there is no compensation,' Mr
Whittaker said .

affiliation
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRADES Union Congress is set to agree to the affiliation of the
breakaway Electrical and Plumbing Industries Union at a meeting of the TUC's
council tomorrow.
The move does not mean that the door is closed to the readmittance of the
EETPU electricians' union, the TUC said yesterday.
The EPIU, which has about 4,000 members, was formed by disaffected members
of the EETPU after that union's expulsion from the TUC in 1988. The
expulsion followed a recruitment row involving two single-union deals. The
TUC finance and general purposes committee yesterday put forward a
recommendation to the council that the EPIU should be allowed to affiliate.
The union was given observer status at the 1989 TUC congress, but was
refused full membership. The AEU engineering union argued then that the EPIU
was dependent on other unions, had no funds of its own or recognition deals
with employers and therefore could not be counted as an independent union.
Mr Gavin Laird, AEU general secretary, said from his union's annual
conference in Eastbourne yesterday: 'The wisdom of the F and GP decision is
questionable. However, this reinforces the case for the EETPU amalgamating
with the AEU.'
The TUC said that the EPIU was considered now to be self-sufficient and no
longer dependent on other unions.
A decision on the union's standing is also expected soon from the
government's certification officer.

<TEXT>
EXTRA financial help is being provided by the government to ensure that its
guarantee of a place to all young people on its main training scheme for 16-
to 19-year-olds is met.
Essex Training and Enterprise Council warned last month that its funding
allocation of Pounds 12.3m for Youth Training in 1991-92 would leave about
5,000 young people without a YT place, out of an estimated total of 6,450 in
the county.
The warning came when many Tecs were expressing fears that cuts in funds for
YT, coupled with rising un-employment, could leave them unable to meet the
guaran-tee.
Mr Roy Lawrence, chairman of Essex Tec, said: 'Essex Tec is delighted that
the government has moved so swiftly to provide an extra amount - more than
Pounds 4m - in response to the recent review of YT in Essex.'
The Department of Employment said Essex Tec had been told that the
government would underwrite any overspend after the Tec had spent on YT the
Pounds 12.3m and any operating surpluses arising from savings on its other
training budgets.
The department said it believed Essex was the only Tec which had said it
could not meet the guarantee. If other Tecs made similar claims they would
have to be reviewed.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Civil Service union to urge rejection
of 8% pay offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of Britain's second-largest Civil Service union will be advised by
their leaders to reject the government's 8 per cent pay offer.
The executive of the NUCPS union also left open the possibility of a ballot
on industrial action if members accepted their rejection recommendation and
the government continued to refuse arbitration.
In contrast, the leadership of the CPSA, tbe largest Civil Service union,
decided to recommend their members to accept a separate 8 per cent offer.
The leaderships of both unions believe the 8 per cent offers break the
spirit of long-term pay agreements which allow a form of comparability with
the private sector.
Under the agreements, offers fall within the middle range of comparable
private-sector settlements in the previous year.
This year the range was 8 per cent to 10 per cent, with a median of 9 per
cent.
Although the offers are 8 per cent the majority of both unions' members will
receive less - 7.6 per cent in the case of CPSA and 7.8 per cent in NUCPS.
The balance is made up of high awards of up to 11 per cent for lower-paid
civil servants.
The Treasury has refused the two unions' request for arbitration.
Ms Marion Chambers, CPSA president, said her union executive felt the
alternative to recommending acceptance was industrial action and there was
no mood for this among members.
Some members of the NUCPS executive believe their members will also be
reluctant to take action.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Howard to put plan for workers' rights
to EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Howard, emp-loyment secretary, yesterday voiced his continuing
opposition to the European Commission's proposed directives on employees'
rights to information and consultation.
He said he would seek to replace them with his own five-point plan.
Mr Howard announced the initiative at a conference to launch a joint
government and Confederation of British Industry campaign to improve
business performance through employee involvement.
He will present the plan on employee involvement to an informal meeting of
his fellow employment ministers in the European Community in early May.
Mr Howard will urge the EC to adopt a voluntary approach towards encouraging
company policies for informing and consulting employees.
The EC has proposed more formal machinery for companies with concerns in
more than one member state, such as the formation of a works council
containing employees from each of the countries covered by the company.
Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the
British initiative looked like 'a smokescreen to cover the government's
embarrassment at being out of step in Europe'.
He said the UK government had consistently tried to veto European proposals
to give employees rights to information and consultation over company
decisions.
The aims of the five-point plan are:
To generate the commitment of all employees to the success of the business.
To enable the business to adapt to changing market requirements and improve
its prospects for the future.
To increase the satisfaction that employees get from their work.
To improve performance and productivity by drawing on the skills and
knowledge of all employees.
To provide all employees with the opportunity to contribute to the
development of their company.
Mr Howard said the voluntary approach allowed companies to establish
arrangements best suited to their own circumstances. He said: 'We shall
therefore continue to resist the imposition of Community legislation on this
subject. That is true of the worker participation proposals in the Fifth
Company Directive and the European Company Statute.' Mr Howard yesterday
said a study by his department showed Labour's economic policies could cost
2.2m jobs - leading Labour to protest at the use of government officials to
compile Tory 'propaganda'.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): London Tube workers vote to strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPERVISORS and booking clerks on London Underground have voted to strike
over cuts of up to 1,800 jobs and changes in working practices, even though
the organisation says it will suspend any employee who takes part in
industrial action.
The ballot held by the TSSA white-collar union will be followed next week by
the result of a ballot about the same issue by 13,000 members of the RMT
transport union working on London Underground. The RMT has threatened a
series of one-day strikes after London Underground's refusal to negotiate on
job losses and changes in working patterns which are intended to help reduce
an anticipated loss of Pounds 92m.
The dispute has broken out at the same time as annual pay talks at British
Rail which resume today. The dispute threatens a repeat of the industrial
action on London Underground in 1989 at the same time as an industrial
dispute at British Rail.
Mr Richard Rosser, TSSA general secretary, said supervisors and
booking-office workers on London Underground did not have a history of
taking industrial action. He hoped managers would realise the strength of
feeling among workers. The TSSA has been upset both at the size of job
losses and at the effect on earnings of changes in working patterns. London
Underground has guaranteed no loss of earnings to staff for the first 18
months of the new rosters.
TSSA members voted for strike action by 575 votes to 289, out of a total of
1,553 ballot papers. London Underground said this result was 'certainly not
an example of a popular uprising'.
The RMT yesterday released a briefing paper given to London Underground
managers advising them of procedures for first warning and then suspending
any staff who take part in industrial action if strikes are called.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said the briefing paper was 'the
action of a desperate, inadequate management' and was already rebounding on
them by making workers more determined to vote for and take industrial
action.
Mr Knapp said the savings from single staffing of stations and reductions in
overtime and weekend working would amount to only Pounds 400,000. The
savings would have little effect on the expected loss even if they were
implemented in full.

FT  23 APR 91 / The Guinness Appeals: 'Ambivalence' over Roux highlighted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN appeal court judge yesterday referred to the 'ambivalent attitude' of the
prosecution towards Mr Olivier Roux, the former Guinness finance director
and the principal prosecution witness.
Mr Justice Ognall said he was 'very troubled' about the status invested in
Mr Roux at the trial last year.
Mr Roux had admitted having known about an allegedly unlawful share support
operation mounted by Guinness during its takeover battle for Distillers, so
why had he not been an accomplice as far as the Crown had been concerned,
the judge asked.
Mr John Chadwick QC, for the Serious Fraud Office, replied that Mr Roux had
consistently said he had not regarded what was done during the bid as
dishonest.
How, the judge asked, did a witness's assertion that he was not dishonest
alter his status?
Mr Chadwick said that if Mr Roux had been treated as an accomplice from the
start, that would have taken the decision from the jury: they had to decide
whether they believed his evidence as to the honesty of the support
operation.
Mr Justice Ognall said: 'I suspect that at least some of the mischief that
has arisen in this particular case may have arisen because of the ambivalent
attitude of the Crown towards Mr Roux and his role in this enterprise.'
Mr Chadwick said the Crown had to form a view as to whether a person had
accepted his criminality. Mr Roux clearly had not, and the Crown had taken
the view that this was something to be left to the jury.
The exchanges came on the fifth day of appeals by Mr Ernest Saunders, former
Guinness chairman and chief executive, Mr Anthony Parnes, a City
stockbroker, and Mr Gerald Ronson, head of the Heron group, against their
convictions and sentences.
The appeals continue today.

BRITAIN'S latest nuclear weapon, the Trident II warhead, should be
redesigned, suggests a draft report from Basic, a London-based think-tank
which specialises in critiques of Nato policy.
The study also calls for a halt to all movements of nuclear weapons in
Britain while an independent review is made of their safety in storage and
transport.
Basic's report draws upon criticism of US nuclear weapons levelled by
independent scientific assessors over a year ago, and assumes that British
weapon designs relate closely to their US counterparts.
Britain's first Trident submarine is scheduled to enter service in 1994. Its
warheads are believed to be behind schedule because of production
difficulties.
They were designed by the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston,
Berk-shire.

FT  23 APR 91 / The Blue Arrow trial: County man 'unaware' of stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER DALE, former managing director of County NatWest Securities,
yesterday insisted to the Blue Arrow trial that he had no knowledge of other
shares taken by County NatWest, CNWS's merchant banking co-subsidiary, until
the day the holding of a discloseable stake was publicly announced.
Mr Dale, a prosecution witness, said that until December 17 1987 he did not
know of the stake, worth almost 5 per cent of Blue Arrow, bought by County's
corporate advisory division.
He knew only of the 4.5 per cent holding taken by CNWS and a similar stake
held by Phillips &amp; Drew which, along with County, advised Blue Arrow on its
1987 rights issue.
County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and
seven individuals all deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the
outcome of the Pounds 837m rights issue.
Mr Dale said he had seen no problem in CNWS accepting its 31m shares from
County's corporate advisory division.
'It was only a problem if you were aware, as NatWest's senior management
were, of the corporate advisory holding and the P&amp;D holding,' he told Mr
Alun Jones QC, for Mr Stephen Clark, a County director and one of the
defendants.
He denied the suggestion from Mr Jones that he had known what was going on.
Mr Dale agreed that he had allowed Stock Exchange rules to be breached by
delaying the reporting to the exchange that the 5 per cent disclosure limit
had been exceeded in normal trading, but described this as 'relatively
trivial'.
Mr Dale told the court that he had been informed by Miss Elizabeth Brimelow,
then compliance director, that County was considering making a larger
disclosure and that the matter was being dealt with at a senior level within
NatWest, the parent bank.
When he learnt of the stake held by the corporate advisory division, he had
said the full holding should be disclosed.
However, since he still thought legal advice had been taken, his concern was
not fully aroused.
The trial continues today.

<TEXT>
AN ANGLO-SOVIET cargo airline is being set up to specialise in transporting
heavy loads, using the Russian-built Antonov AN124 Ruslan, one of the
world's biggest aircraft, capable of carrying 150 tonnes of cargo.
The joint venture airline involves a partnership between HeavyLift Cargo
Airlines, a subsidiary of the UK Trafalgar House group, and the Soviet
Volga-Dnepr company. The airline is expected to start operating in June,
adding more AN124s to its fleet before this year ends.
The Soviet transport aircraft, equipped with on-board hoist and crane
systems to load heavy goods both front and back, with minimum ground
equipment, will be used to carry the largest tracked or wheeled vehicles,
aerospace and space-related components, oil pollution control gear, building
materials and relief supplies for international agencies.
HeavyLift Cargo Airlines operates a fleet of large Belfasts, Hercules,
Boeing 707s and Guppy aircraft to transport heavy loads.
Soviet officials described the joint venture as 'an important contribution
to developing Anglo-Soviet trade and economic relations'.
The Soviet partner is one of the first joint stock enterprises set up in the
Soviet Union. Still ultimately controlled by the state, these new
enterprises do not come under the rigid departmental control, enjoying
greater operating flexibility.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T Microelectronics, a division of the US telecommunications company, and
NEC of Japan will jointly develop technologies to make future generations of
semiconductors, they said yesterday.
The agreement comes as Washington and Tokyo are negotiating a new pact on
semiconductor market access in Japan, and is a sign Japanese companies
intend to build closer links to the US electronics industry, in an attempt
to reduce trade tension.
For the next two years, the two companies have agreed to develop jointly the
manufacturing processes for further miniaturisation, enabling them to
increase the memory capacity and functions of an individual chip.
While other semiconductor companies compete to develop similar technology,
executives of the two companies said the joint effort would provide big
advantages.
Mr William Warwick, president of AT&amp;T Microelectronics, claimed developing
the 0.35-micron process, as the system is known, is likely to cost Dollars
400m (Pounds 232m) to Dollars 500m.
A micron is a millionth of a metre. The smaller the micron measurement, the
more advanced the chip. The next generation of memory chips, 16-megabit
chips, are being developed using 0.5-micron technology.
AT&amp;T and NEC are aiming for even more chip generations with the 0.35-micron
technology. The companies will be sharing sensitive technologies in
ultra-fine etching and circuiting, but say they are likely to have few
problems in sorting out ownership rights of new processes.
'If the patent is developed from the joint effort, it will be used by both
of us. If there are necessary patents that we already own, they will be
licensed for the joint work,' Mr Warwick said.
The companies plan to break down the development process into tasks they
call 'modules', with 50-70 researchers from each company working on each
module. There will be about 25 of these modules, and the two companies will
exchange at least one researcher for each module, and have agreed to report
regularly on progress.
The project follows a more general pact signed in March last year, where the
companies agreed to co-operate in semiconductor development.
'The relationship represents a win-win situation for both companies. Through
partnering, each company shares resources, lowers individual company risks
and gains timely access to technology,' Mr Warwick said.
Mr Tomihiro Matsumura, NEC executive vice-president, said the agreement
represents 'true co-operation between two multinational semiconductor
companies', and proves the enthusiasm of each for 'a long-term co-operative
relationship'.

FT  23 APR 91 / World Trade News: US prepares to repel Chinese software
pirates - Peking is being challenged to prove it can protect foreign
intellectual property, writes Lynne Curry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNE CURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDER pressure from the US and other foreign business executives, China is
attempting to strengthen its patent law and develop a code for the
protection of computer software manufacturers, but is hampered by
conflicting domestic interests.
The Chinese government is also making efforts to revise its patent law and
draft copyright regulations to protect computer software manufacturers, but
doing so involves many Chinese companies and 'could be a hard job',
according to the official English language China Daily.
China's lack of copyright regulations and its limited patent law were the
subject of discussion between the Chinese and a visiting US official in
February.
'The concern is enormous', said the official, Mr Joseph Massey, assistant US
trade representative. 'If the problem of piracy of software doesn't get
fixed, we will have to take action.'
While software piracy is rampant, illegal copying of other proprietary works
is also widespread. Entire sections of some bookstores only sell
unauthorised copies of foreign books.
Other examples of piracy include records, video tapes, computer hardware and
even the Disney characters, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. The purpose of Mr
Massey's visit was to determine how much progress the Chinese have made
towards drafting copyright legislation which would provide effective
protection for computer software manufacturers.
'It's at an early stage, but we have a lot of problems with what we have
seen,' Mr Massey said.
The trade representative said China must show progress on its draft
copyright regulations before April 15, the statutory deadline under US law,
when the trade office makes recommendations to the administration about
retaliatory actions against countries deemed to be following unfair trade
practices with the US.
This can result in additional tariffs on a country's exports to the US.
China is already on a 'priority watch' list, because of concern about the
piracy problem and inadequate efforts to prevent it.
In an effort to resolve the problems, a Chinese delegation was expected in
Washington in mid-April for talks on intellectual property rights and
bilateral scientific co-operation.
China's current patent law does not provide adequate protection for chemical
and pharmaceutical products, according to western lawyers. It protects only
the process by which a compound is made, not the product. If a chemical
process is altered only slightly, pirated versions of an already patented
compound could be made legally in China. The Chinese are considering
expanding the patent law, extending the protection period for inventions to
20 years from the present 15 and widening protection to include the product
directly obtained by such a process, according to the China Daily.
But the debate is believed to be deadlocked, with some ministries supporting
the proposed revision and the Ministry of Chemical Industry fighting it.
Apart from problems with pharmaceutical products, software piracy has
reached epidemic proportions in China. US software manufacturers estimate
that unauthorised copying of software has resulted in Dollars 400m of annual
lost sales to China.
The traditional Chinese approach to copyright and other intellectual
property issues differs significantly from the western view that some works
have proprietary ownership.
'The Chinese consider it an honour to lift someone else's work and publish
it,' said one Western businessman involved with copyright problems.
'The Chinese have a much harder time formulating a law which is acceptable
to the west, because the idea of certain work belonging to an individual is
antithetical to socialist precepts,' one western lawyer said.
A vague copyright law will become effective in June. Western observers say
problems with the legislation arise not only with its vagueness but with the
implementing regulations being debated by Chinese officials. The law does
not stipulate on the time limit that a work can be protected, and it states
that a foreign work can only be protected if it was first published or
produced in China, according to western lawyers.
Much secrecy surrounds implementing regulations which would provide more
detail about the scope of the copyright law.
Mofert is believed to favour strong copyright regulations, while ministries
 -such as the Ministry of Chemical Industry - with vested interests in
continuing to make cheap, illegal copies of software have opposed the
legislation.
'Certain ministries have been told to pirate as much software as they can,
so that when the law does go into effect, they will have everything,' one
western executive said.
'Mofert has overall responsibility for this issue, but the other ministries
are telling Mofert to get lost.'
Not all ministries are copying software illegally, and some do recognise
proprietary rights.
But Western analysts say that China's ability to provide adequate protection
for foreign intellectual property is vital if the country wants continued
access to investment and high technology.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH SNCF rail board yesterday placed orders for FFr10bn (Pounds
990m)-worth of double-decker high-speed trains with a consortium led by
GEC-Alsthom, the Franco-British engineering group.
This is one of SNCF's biggest orders and aims to boost capacity of its
near-saturated domestic Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV) routes in the second
half of the decade, so cutting the need for new track.
This will be greeted with relief by environmental groups, which have
protested against plans to extend the 10-year-old Paris-Lyon TGV line to the
Mediterranean.
The double-deckers will take the expected strain on the Paris-Brussels TGV
route, two years after it opens in 1993, but will be too large for the UK
end of the Channel Tunnel line.
The order comes as GEC-Alsthom is negotiating against Italian, German and
Swiss competition for four overseas TGV contracts, in Canada, the US, South
Korea and Taiwan.
The double-deckers will carry 520 passengers, 35 per cent more than existing
single-deckers, but cruise at the same 300 kmh as the newest TGVs now in
service. Each train includes eight carriages, with a locomotive at each end.
The contract includes firm orders to develop and produce 45 trains, with 55
more under option. Other consortium members include ANF Industries, France's
second biggest maker of railway rolling stock, and De Dietrich, the French
electrical engineering and household appliance group.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPROMISE proposal, introduced yesterday in the US Senate, improves the
chances for congressional approval of the 'fast-track' negotiating authority
necessary for an extension of the Uruguay Round trade talks.
However, under the plan submitted by Senator Donald Riegle, chairman of the
Senate banking committee, Congress would hold a much tighter rein on talks
for a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.
The fast track is a parliamentary procedure that speeds trade negotiations
by allowing Congress only a single yes-or-no vote on trade pacts. Mr Riegle
is proposing to grant the fast track for the Uruguay Round but to permit
Congress to amend the FTA in selected areas.
The senator is typical of many in both houses of Congress, supporting the
Uruguay Round but concerned that an FTA would mean the loss of manufacturing
jobs to Mexico.
The combined opposition to both has put in jeopardy the administration's
prime trade objectives. Either the House or the Senate can kill the fast
track by voting against it by June 1.
In a press conference yesterday, Mr Riegle accused the administration of
proposing the pact for foreign policy, rather than economic policy,
considerations. The US economy is getting worse, he said, not better.
'Mexico is too poor to buy most of our products, but is often willing to
sacrifice its environment and worker safety to lure US companies with
low-wage rates,' he said. Mexican workers earn one-tenth of that earned by
US workers, and the country's work safety, child labour and environmental
laws are only loosely enforced.
Under Mr Riegle's proposal, Congress would be permitted to amend an FTA pact
in the five areas of greatest congressional concern: labour standards;
environmental protection; 'rule of origin' which would prevent other nations
from funneling goods through Mexico into the US; assistance for American
workers displaced by imports; and dispute resolution.

FT  23 APR 91 / Washington bank group attacks Polish debt deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Euromarkets Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision by the Paris Club of creditor governments to forgive at least
half Poland's debt is unhelpful for the stability of the international
financial system, the Institute of International Finance, the
Washington-based group which promotes the views of international banks, said
yesterday.
Mr Horst Schulmann, IIF managing director, described the forgiving of
Poland's debts as foreign aid through the back door. It would lead other
debtor governments to seek similar treatment, he said, suggesting it would
contribute to the breakdown of order in international finance.
He also criticised the pressure on banks to match the Paris Club. 'In
contrast to governments, banks cannot be in the aid business,' he said.
This pressure was one of two developments over the past six months - the
other being the continued growth of interest arrears owed by developing
countries to commercial banks - which were damaging the prospects for flows
of private capital to middle-income countries, he said.
The IIF calculated that interest arrears owed to banks grew to Dollars
26.8bn (Pounds 14.9bn) at the end of March, from about Dollars 18bn six
months earlier. The figure includes Dollars 9.5bn owed in interest by
Brazil, which reached a preliminary agreement with banks on clearing Dollars
8bn of interest arrears this month - an agreement which must be ratified by
Brazil's senate and 95 per cent of creditor banks.
Mr Schulmann said the fact that some countries were allowed to build up
arrears while others, particularly in Asia, did not, showed a double
standard. Financial institutions should refuse all new loans to countries in
arrears until they have an effective agreement to eliminate them.
He called on finance ministers, in Washington this week for the spring
meetings of the IMF and World Bank, to address three issues: the global
capital shortage, which could not be managed merely by lowering interest
rates; interest arrears by debtor countries; and the growing 'moral hazard'
in the international financial system, epitomised by the Polish debt
forgiveness deal.

FT  23 APR 91 / De Klerk urges more UK links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT F W de Klerk of South Africa last night appealed to Mr John Major
the UK prime minister to help him win investment as apartheid is steadily
dismantled. It was the two leaders' first meeting.
At a working supper at the British premier's official residence in London Mr
Major told him efforts to end race policies should be rewarded by the
scrapping of sanctions and the sports boycott which has left South Africa
isolated.
Mr de Klerk, on a two-day visit to London, earlier held a private meeting
with representatives of banks and financial institutions, at which he called
for the strengthening of trade and investment links between Britain and
Pretoria.
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank of England governor, was among senior
bankers present. Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank and
Sir John Quinton, his Barclays Bank counterpart, are also believed to have
attended the meeting.
Mr de Klerk is accompanied by his deputy foreign minister, Mr Leon Wessels,
who met Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, in the afternoon.
Today Mr de Klerk will address the conference of the Institute of Directors,
and speak at the Royal Institute for International Affairs. He leaves
tomorrow for Denmark, before flying to Ireland on Thursday and back to
London on Friday to speak to the Confederation of British Industry and the
UK-South Africa Trade Association.
Amnesty International, the human rights organisation, yesterday criticised
what it called 'the lack of accountability' of the South African security
forces.
Amnesty said there was 'a pattern of unlawful behaviour by members of the
security forces' which lent weight to 'allegations of unprovoked use . . .
of lethal force.'
The statement called on the government 'to bring to justice those members of
the security forces responsible for human rights violations'.

<TEXT>
EXTREME right-wing members of the Israeli government said yesterday Mr
Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, had promised them he would not
compromise on Jewish settlement of the occupied territories, despite
Washington's protests that continued settlement could upset its Middle East
peace effort.
Meanwhile Mr Yossi Ben-Aharon, head of the prime minister's office, said the
government would not accept any Palestinian from Jerusalem in a Palestinian
delegation to talks and opposed extending the role of a proposed regional
peace conference beyond an opening function for later bilateral
negotiations.
Both issues - along with settlements - are among the obstacles to convening
Arab-Israeli talks that Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, will seek
to overcome when he returns to Israel today for further talks.
Mr Shamir met the Tehiya party, a three-member faction in the coalition led
by the Likud party, and a group of settlers to discuss their concerns. Ms
Geula Cohen, a Tehiya junior minister, said afterwards Mr Shamir had
'promised that settlement will not be harmed'.
Ending Jewish settlement of the West Bank and Gaza Strip is a key demand of
Palestinians and other potential Arab peace conference participants. But Mr
Shamir's government has repeatedly vowed that it should continue.
Yesterday, opposition politicians published a report they said showed
mortgage subsidies beyond those available in Israel proper were on offer to
settlers to encourage faster settlement.

FT  23 APR 91 / Soviet Union collapse not in west's interest, warns Hurd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISINTEGRATION of the Soviet Union into separate states was contrary to
the interests of the rest of Europe and the west as a whole, Mr Douglas
Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said in London yesterday.
Mr Hurd, who was addressing the British Atlantic Group of Young Politicians,
conceded that the western European states could not have much influence on
developments inside the Soviet Union. That was a matter for the Soviet
people themselves.
'But what we can say is that it is not in the interests of Europe as a
whole, or of the west, to see the Soviet Union disintegrate into a
kaleidoscope of republics, some quite weak, some divided within their own
boundaries, and leaving a possibility of continuing disorder and weakness .
. .'
What the west wanted to see was a Soviet Union which was dedicated to
reform, and in which the links between the various republics were based on
consent rather than on command and force. It wanted to help the Soviet Union
to reform itself.
Turning to the lessons that Europe should draw from the events of the past
year and the Gulf war, in particular, Mr Hurd expressed strong support for
greater foreign policy co-ordination within the EC.
'I can see in our dealings with the Soviet Union . . . over events in the
Baltic states, that it really would be crazy if there were separate and
contrasted British, French, German, Italian policies towards what is
happening in the Soviet Union,' Mr Hurd said.
However, he reiterated Britain's opposition to majority voting on foreign
and security policy issues, which, Mr Hurd claimed, would have led to a less
effective European reaction in the Gulf crisis.
In the aftermath of the Gulf conflict, one particular problem which the
Twelve should now be considering, in co-operation with the US, the Soviet
Union and China, was the problem of arms exports and the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction.
In spite of calling for greater intra-European co-operation on security and
defence policies, Mr Hurd stressed that Nato remained 'the main defence
institution of western Europe and the Atlantic'.
While Nato had to be reformed if it were to survive and remain relevant, to
allow it to disappear would be 'to spit in the face of the lessons of
history. It would be a great foolishness, the kind of foolishness we
committed in the past and regretted.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Lech Walesa arrives in London today hoping for good weather and
determined to convey some 'home truths' about the way western countries are
dragging their feet over reuniting Europe in the twilight of the cold war.
'I perform badly when its rainy and misty' he said, adding: 'I've had the
sun on my other trips,' referring to recent journeys to Washington, Paris
and Brussels where he has urged western investors to come to Poland.
These visits have revealed west European leaders unwilling to speed
integration with post-Communist countries at the moment when, according to
Mr Walesa, 'everything is possible'.
In Britain he will be encouraging businessmen to put money into Poland,
where the government is maintaining strict monetary controls in an attempt
to lower inflation to a monthly 1 per cent by the end of the year.
Mr Walesa will meet bankers at the Bank of England on Thursday and urge them
to halve the Dollars 11bn his country owes them, as western governments have
agreed to do.
His visit comes in the wake of 40 hours of talks in Paris at the weekend
between Polish negotiators and representatives of 17 western countries to
whom Poland owes Dollars 33bn. The talks produced a framework for a 50 per
cent debt reduction.
This foresees Poland devoting Dollars 600m a year until 1994 to debt service
payments, by which time the debt should have been reduced by half on
condition that Poland maintains its anti-inflation programme agreed with the
International Monetary Fund.
Repayment of the entire debt, however, should be complete by the year 2014.
President Walesa will be staying with the Queen at Windsor during his
three-day visit. Meetings with Mr John Major and Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the
present and former prime ministers, and Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour party
leader, are also envisaged.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE TO protect the European Community's troubled electronics industry
intensified over the weekend at a crisis meeting between key members of the
European Commission and the EC's five main electronics companies.
The industrialists pressed their case for specific support measures going
beyond the general plan presented by Brussels last month to channel more EC
research money into demand-creating infrastructure projects. The
commissioners apparently expressed sympathy for the companies' increasing
difficulty with Japanese competition, but in no way committed the EC
executive, officials said yesterday.
The secret meeting was called last Friday and Saturday in a small town in
Burgundy by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, with Bull and
Thomson, France's state-controlled electronics companies, Siemens of
Germany, Olivetti of Italy and Philips of the Netherlands. Also present were
Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC industry commissioner, Mr Filippo Maria
Pandolfi, the research commissioner, and their two directors-general.
The attempted secrecy of the meeting, news of which leaked into the French
press over the weekend, reflects the sensitivity of the issue, as much
within the Community as in relations with Japan.
Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner who had succeeded in pruning
dirigiste elements out of the Commission's March paper on the electronics
sector, was a notable absentee from the Burgundy meeting, though he was
assured in advance that it would not compromise his policy of controlling
state aids. Sir Leon is examining the complaint by ICL of Britain, which is
majority-owned by Fujitsu of Japan, against the French government's recent
decision to inject FFr6bn (Pounds 590m) of fresh capital into Bull and
Thomson.
Mr Alain Gomez, the chairman of Thomson, recently called for the
establishment of high EC customs duties on Japanese electronic goods for an
adjustment period of five years. 'That will be enough for us to catch up the
unwarranted advantage acquired by the Japanese thanks to 30 years of unfair
competition,' he told Le Monde newspaper. An EC official said yesterday that
Mr Gomez's ideas could not be considered close to Commission thinking.
Tomorrow, EC research ministers will discuss, at France's insistence, the
issue of whether foreign-owned companies should participate in EC research
programmes. ICL was recently barred from a couple of Esprit information
technology programmes in which it had been marginally involved. But UK
officials said yesterday Mr Pandolfi had assured them that ICL would not be
excluded from any important research on grounds of its ownership.

FT  23 APR 91 / Kohl's chickens home to roost: Chancellor's problems are of
his own making, writes David Marsh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST AS Chancellor Helmut Kohl's problems over German unity have been
manifestly increasing, his capacity to do anything about them has now
plummeted. Sunday's crushing defeat for his Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate leaves Mr Kohl's party in control in
only one of the 10 west German states making up the old Federal Republic.
The loss of the right's majority in the upper house of parliament, the
Bundesrat (federal council), which has a veto over all tax legislation,
significantly constrains Mr Kohl's ability to govern. Less than five months
after the Chancellor gained a sweeping victory in the December 2 all-German
general elections, German politics is facing a confused period of
confrontation, uncertainty and drift.
The centre-right coalition in Bonn, made up of the CDU, the Bavarian
Christian Social Union (CSU), and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP),
still has a secure majority in the lower house, the Bundestag. But Germany's
highly developed system of political checks and balances now deprives Mr
Kohl of the necessary means to push through unpopular decisions.
A large part of his misfortunes stems from his lack of foresight last year
in failing to present voters with a more accurate picture of the economic
and social challenges caused by German unification. Mr Hans-Werner Meyer,
the head of Germany's Trade Union Federation (DGB), believes that, if Mr
Kohl had announced the likelihood of tax rises before the December
elections, he would probably have won with a still higher majority.
As it is, following the large rises in taxes and social security levies
decided in February, the Chancellor is now paying a triple price for his
foolishness. First, as was widely predicted at the end of his year of
victory in 1990, his personal credibility has taken a nosedive.
Second, the round of Social Democrat election successes in recent state
polls has resurrected regional coalitions between the SPD and the Greens in
Lower Saxony, Hesse and now (probably) Rhineland-Palatinate. This has
effectively resurrected at a regional level the Greens party which is one of
Mr Kohl's pet hates, and which appeared to be close to extinction after its
collapse in the national December elections.
Third, Mr Kohl's misfortunes have prepared the way for a new spate of
coalition bickering. The Chancellor's slightly bizarre revelation a
fortnight ago that Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the wheelchair-bound interior
minister, was the most likely man to succeed him has been roundly criticised
by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and CSU chairman. Mr Waigel - who
shares the blame for last year's extraordinary economic policy insouciance -
believes that the premature start to a leadership debate has damaged the
coalition's poll standing.
Mr Waigel himself has done his bit towards incurring the wrath of the
free-market wing of the FDP, by announcing at the end of last week his
decision to water down plans for cuts in the next few years in taxes on
companies and high-earners. But these would anyway now have been blocked by
the SPD majority in the Bundesrat - as well as by the need to trim the
swelling budget deficit.
In view of decision-making disarray, and the sharp deterioration in
Germany's financial position, Mr Kohl's main hope is that an international
economic recovery later this year come to Germany's rescue.
Unfortunately, the foreign exchange markets - where the D-Mark fell
yesterday to a 17-month low against the dollar - may upset the prospects.
With the Bundesbank signalling its desire to press harder on the monetary
brakes to bolster the D-Mark, Mr Kohl may face before too long, in addition
to the recession in east Germany, a sharp slowdown in growth in the
previously booming west.

FT  23 APR 91 / Gas price formula may go to MMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Gas could face a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation if
it fails to agree in the next week to revise its formula for setting the
price of gas for 17m domestic and small business customers.
The company was last night finalising its response to an 11-month review
into the formula and said it would respond to the industry regulator's
proposals by the end of April.
The Office of Gas Supply (Ofgas) is apparently planning to turn the review
over to the MMC if British Gas does not respond in the next week. The
pricing formula review is the first since British Gas was privatised five
years ago.
If British Gas accepts Ofgas's proposals, it will face tighter controls on
standards of service and a less generous pricing formula, which should
reduce consumers' energy costs.
Ofgas argues that, in the absence of competitive suppliers of gas, it must
force British Gas to set public standards, for example on call-out times and
disconnections, against which it can be held to account.
Under its current price formula, British Gas can increase prices by the rate
of general price inflation, less an efficiency clawback of two percentage
points. The company is also allowed to pass on to customers all increases in
the cost of North Sea gas.
Gas users have complained that this structure provides no incentive for
British Gas to seek lower-priced supplies. Ofgas has also queried whether
British Gas operates its own gas fields in the most efficient way.
At the same time, Ofgas is likely to reduce the amount British Gas can add
to prices to account for inflation. This is most likely to take the form of
increasing the so-called efficiency factor from two to perhaps three or four
percentage points a year.
When the regulator revamped British Telecom's pricing structure three years
ago, this element was increased from three to 4.5 percentage points.
The Gas Consumers Council has called on British Gas to cut the
inflation-related increase it adds on to prices, but not by cutting the
quality of service it offers consumers.

FT  23 APR 91 / Dollar hits 16-month high against weakened D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR rose to a 16-month high yesterday on the back of a fast-falling
D-Mark, weakened in the political aftermath of the weekend's state election
in Germany.
Sterling was also undermined as the US unit kept up its gains on hopes of an
imminent end to the US recession.
In Germany and abroad, the vote against the ruling Christian Democrats was
seen as a further blow for Mr Helmut Kohl, the chancellor, when the
condition of the east German economy is causing increasing concern.
The defeat in Mr Kohl's home state of Rhineland-Palatinate also removes the
government's majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, which
has the power to veto legislation.
The dollar was also helped by comments from Mr Otmar Issing, a Bundesbank
director, who restated the bank's policy of following a monetary and not an
exchange rate goal.
Dealers took this to mean the Bundesbank did not intend to intervene heavily
to stem the dollar's rise, although it is keen that the German currency
should remain strong to help ward off rising inflation.
Central banks have not been intervening to curb the marks recent falls with
concerted dollar sales. This has added to market perceptions that the US
authorities are happy to see the dollar strengthen further, and that the
Federal Reserve is content with the current level of interest rates.
As the Bundesbank is thought to be unwilling to stem the D-Mark's fall, the
markets are expecting the currency volatility to last at least until
agreements about interest rates emerge from this week's meeting of the Group
of Seven in Washington.
The dollar climbed to a Frankfurt close of DM1.7585 - its highest since the
end of 1989 - and continued to gain in New York where it finished at
DM1.762.
German share prices fell back with the currency. On the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, the DAX index shed 1.7 per cent to 1,571.91.
US share prices were also weaker. Disappointment at the Federal Reserve's
refusal to cut interest rates combined with profit-taking to leave the Dow
Jones Industrial Average 37.87 lower at 2,927.72. The Dow has fallen more
than 76 points since it reached its record 3,004.46 on Wednesday.
There were also sharp falls in the pound - losing 3 cents in London to
Dollars 1.6925 before edging back to Dollars 1.6955 in New York - and on
London's equity market, where the FT-SE 100 index ended 29.3 lower at
2490.8.
Sterling, which has been weakened by recent economic data suggesting that
the recession has yet to touch its trough, is also becoming vulnerable to
political uncertainty ahead of the local elections on May 2.

FT  23 APR 91 / Budget sparks big rise in retail sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S high streets saw their sharpest increase in business for almost 12
years last month as shoppers hurried to beat the April deadline for VAT and
excise increases announced in the Budget.
Retail sales figures from the Central Statistical Office yesterday showed
that volumes rose by a provisional 3.7 per cent in March, after a fall of
0.1 per cent in February.
This was the largest monthly rise since June 1979, when volumes surged by
6.9 per cent in the wake of a similarly unexpected decision to raise VAT.
Few industry analysts, however, expect volume levels to be sustained into
April.
In the Budget Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced his intention to
raise VAT to 17.5 per cent to pay for big reductions in individual poll tax
bills. This increase had a particularly marked effect on sales of large
electrical goods, televisions, furniture and carpets in the last two weeks
of March, according to the Retail Consortium, which says it represents 90
per cent of the industry.
The Budget's indexation of excise duties on alcohol led to 'excellent' sales
of wines and spirits ahead of the price increases on April 1, the consortium
said.
The other big factor boosting sales was that the whole Easter period -
traditionally a time for heavy purchases of confectionery and gifts - fell
in March, said the CSO.
The month also benefited from the stimulus of balmy weather and interest
rate cuts.
The CSO said no adjustment had been made to account for the timing of
Easter. The monthly value of sales in March was Pounds 12.2bn against Pounds
9.26bn the previous month.
Trends in retail sales remain depressed. In February, a provisional 1 per
cent rise was subsequently revised into a final 0.1 per cent fall. The
underlying rate of growth in sales volumes during the three months to March
was still only 0.9 per cent, and 0.6 per cent lower than the same period a
year ago.
The Treasury said it was 'difficult to draw any underlying conclusions' from
the figures, which had been 'propelled upwards by the VAT measure and the
Easter holiday.'
Mr David Walton of Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, said record rises
in unemployment and sharp contraction of credit growth suggested a
consumer-led recovery was still a long way off. He expects sales volumes
this month to fall by about 3 per cent.
The surge had little impact on London's financial markets, which remained
preoccupied by the internal troubles of Germany and the rise of the dollar.
The provisional index of retail sales volumes was 122.9 (1985=100) in March,
after 118.5 in February.

PLANS FOR sharp curbs on strikes and political rallies in the Soviet Union,
coupled with an emergency system for distributing grain and other foodstuffs
were put before parliament in Moscow yesterday by Mr Valentin Pavlov, the
prime minister.
The proposed programme to deal with the country's escalating economic crisis
also calls for financial stabilisation measures, giving Gosbank, the central
bank, the power to control spending by republican governments.
The measures are almost certain to be approved by the parliament and Mr
Pavlov suggested that the Kremlin may resort to force to implement them. The
proposals involve banning strikes and political rallies during working
hours.
Hard-liners in the Soyuz (Union) group called for the declaration of a state
of emergency which would impose a ban on strikes and bring rebel republics
to heel. Mr Pavlov said in response: 'They are right in two respects. There
is a need for a special regime in certain crucial branches of the economy,
such as energy and transport, and in certain regions.'
Although it seeks to encourage privatisation and foreign investment, the
plan has been criticised by the country's leading economists as too vague to
combat the budget crisis.
Mr Pavlov stressed that the so-called anti-crisis programme required
co-operation with the republics and that any use of force would be limited.
In the case of the current coal strikes, he suggested that force could be
used to allow working miners to cross picket lines.
He said: 'A state of emergency, or special regime, does not mean that people
will be forced back to work, but it is possible to let people work with the
help of force. For that purpose, we do not need the army.'
President Mikhail Gorbachev, who faces threats to his leadership from his
own Communist Party and as a result of strikes backed by opposition forces,
is under pressure to opt for a coalition government.
However, Mr Pavlov rejected calls for a coalition. He said his appeal a few
months ago for alternative cabinet nominations had been ignored by the
republics.
He added that it was not up to him to decide whether to agree to the
proposal by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader, for 'round table' talks
with republican leaders and opposition forces.
Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan, said, however, that
the government could not introduce market reforms without recognising the
sovereignty of republics.
Mr Pavlov's programme also proposes that republics which refuse to sign a
union treaty and contribute to the union budget should be charged hard
currency for raw materials and energy. Only eight out of 15 republics have
agreed to sign the treaty incorporating them into a political federation.
The economic union proposal, approved by the republics last year as the
foundation for economic reform, committed republics to a common market and
currency, a financial stabilisation programme, and rapid privatisation.
Mr Gorbachev is due to discuss the draft treaty with the republics today.
One possible compromise would be to stop trying to push republics into
signing the treaty if they agree to drop trade barriers, subscribe to a
common financial policy, and delegate limited responsibilities to the
central government.

Slow but steady take-off - Patrick Blum discusses Madeira as an offshore
business centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS not exactly been plain sailing for Madeira's offshore business
centre. Establishing a new legal framework to cover financial institutions,
manufacturers in the free trade zone and a new international shipping
register has taken up more time and encountered more bureaucratic obstacles
than expected. Nevertheless, Madeira is slowly taking off as a viable
alternative or addition to existing offshore centres in Europe and
elsewhere.
'If you look at the early years of other centres, their own development was
not any faster than ours. Early days are always difficult,' says Mr
Francisco Costa, chairman of the Madeira Development Company (SDM), which is
responsible for developing the island's offshore activities.
In spite of initial problems, Madeira already has attracted a good number of
businesses including 13 banks, 231 service and trading companies, and 10
manufacturing companies. Another five banks have applied to set up an
offshore branch, 10 more service companies have applied for a licence, and
three more manufacturing companies are waiting for authorisation to operate
in the free trade zone. Response to the shipping register has been slower
with only five vessels registered so far.
Initially, only branches of banks and investment companies could operate in
the offshore centre. This was later extended to all financial institutions.
Now new laws are being prepared to allow funds to be domiciled locally and
to enable the local incorporation of full banks and insurance companies as
opposed to only branches. Mr Costa expects these to be in place this year.
The shipping register has posed bigger problems. Until now, all crews for
Portuguese registered ships had to be 100 per cent Portuguese, a standard
requirement in Portugal. This is in the process of being changed so that
crews will only need to be 50 per cent from the European Community.
Restrictive and uncompetitive Portuguese mortgage regulations were another
problem, and this is also being changed to allow ship-owners to choose the
law under which they will operate when registering a ship. New legislation
will also allow private yachts to be registered.
Mr Carlos Sousa, general manager of Steermar, a ship management services
company, says he expects to register 80-100 ships in the first year after
the new law is approved. 'Foreign shippers are waiting for the change. We've
had many enquiries, especially from Germany,' he says.
The free trade zone has had more success with a mix of companies from as far
apart as Brazil (plastics), Ireland (gold and jewellery), Lebanon (textiles
and marble), Liechtenstein (precision optical instruments), Hong Kong
(garments), and Portugal (construction materials, tobacco, electronics,
food, and chemicals). Only a handful have started work, the others are
building their own factories or in the process of installing machinery.
The free zone is on a 120-hectare site on Madeira's eastern coast some 8km
from the airport and 30km from Funchal, the island's main town. Next to the
smaller town of Canical, it is easily accessible though the roads and a
tunnel leading to the site are having to be widened and upgraded to cope
with the heavier traffic. About half the initial 40 hectares to be prepared
in a first phase of development have been completed: the land levelled,
roads and infrastructures including water supplies and telecommunications
installed. Work on a new deep sea port directly serving the site began in
October 1990 and is due to be completed by the middle of next year. The
island's main airport will be expanded to enable it to receive bigger
aircraft and to improve freight facilities.
Officials say rents are competitive at Dollars 13.50 per square metre of
land per year for a minimum of five years for companies building their own
installations, and Dollars 40 per square metre for ready-made building.
Offshore financial business is centred in Funchal. So far all but one of the
bank branches established are Portuguese. The exception is Lloyds Bank Fund
Management of Guernsey, to be joined soon by Banque Franco Portugaise of
France. Mr Costa believes this is to be expected of the centre's
development. 'It is important to have Portuguese banks. It has a
demonstration effect showing Portuguese banks are confident about the
centre's prospects.'
The banks do any type of business from taking deposits - there is strong
competition for remittances of emigrant Portuguese workers and the savings
of the wider Portuguese community around the world - to trade financing,
fund management and granting credit.
There are considerable attractions for investors and companies. Incentives
include full tax holidays until 2011 for all financial institutions, trading
and manufacturing companies setting up offshore or in the free zone. This
allows banks, for example, to offer better conditions to their customers at
no extra costs.
Foreign exchange rules have been liberalised. However, this has caused some
concern to the financial authorities in Lisbon. Accordingly, the central
bank has asked for clarification on regulations covering the operations of
Portuguese non-banking institutions which it argues should be treated under
the same tax regime as their mother companies and not as foreign companies.
The central bank would like all non-financial Portuguese companies wishing
to operate offshore to first seek the bank's approval. 'There's a hole in
the legislation on this,' a bank official says.
Several Portuguese or Madeiran companies, such as Companhia Insular de
Moinhos (CIM), a biscuit and pasta manufacturer, are moving into the free
zone to take advantage of the favourable tax regime. CIM is also using the
opportunity to restructure and modernise its production.
Requests for information have been 'pouring in', according to Mr Joao Luis
Dias, director of Dixcart Management (Madeira), a subsidiary of the Dixcart
group. He says establishment procedures have greatly improved, making it
possible to incorporate a company within a little more than two weeks.
Office space has been scarce, but supply is improving. Dixcart recently
moved into new premises while The New Madeira Investment Servicos, another
management company, prepares to make its own move. The original optimism
appears unchanged. 'The centre is well regulated and we keep standards high.
I don't have any doubts about the future,' Mr Costa says.

Standards are rising - Doing business in Portugal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM

<TEXT>
'PORTUGAL,' quipped a Mozambican friend, 'is an African country with a
European vocation.'
The remark, neatly turning round a popular saying about Portugal's historic
links with Africa, has more than a grain of truth in it.
Life in Portugal, especially in the southern half of the country, is
tempered by a distinctly non-European nonchalance; spontaneity, a tendency
to leave decisions to the last minute and a desire to please, all mixed with
a strong streak of fatalism, seem designed to test the patience of visitors.
If you are in a hurry, Portugal is not the place for you.
If you add to that problems that result from an as yet under-developed
infrastructure, poor though improving telecommunications, and the dead
weight of a massive state bureaucracy with its over-abundant 'red tape,' it
is easy to see why business people occasionally despair they will ever get
anything done.
Portugal's ties with its former colonies in Asia, with Portuguese-speaking
Brazil and more especially with Africa, are still much in evidence.
Immigrants from Cape Verde, Angola and Mozambique make up a good proportion
of workers on building sites in and around Lisbon.
In late afternoons, the northern side of the Rossio, the capital's main
square, is animated with groups of immigrants who have made it a meeting
point to exchange gossip or simply while away the hours.
But for all these vivid reminders of Portugal's colonial past, Lisbon has
been rediscovering Europe with an official enthusiasm matched only by
generous helpings of European Community funds.
EC membership is assisting Portugal to overcome decades of neglect and
changing attitudes. Foreign investment has poured into the country helping
to modernise industries and infrastructures.
The pressure of EC integration is forcing the pace of change.
The range and quality of goods and services is improving, new businesses are
bringing more ideas and promoting the cause of efficiency. Standards of
living have risen, though wide disparities of wealth are still noticeable.
Wages are the lowest in Europe, and this has been an important attraction
for foreign investors.
While the public sector is plagued with poor industrial relations and
strikes from government bureaucrats to policemen, teachers, doctors, and
museum attendants, the private sector is practically free of strife.
Managers of multinational companies say that while local workers generally
have lower initial skills, they respond well to training and can achieve
levels of proficiency that can compete with levels elsewhere.
Housing is often sub-standard with poor safety and hygiene. There is a
serious housing shortage, but foreign executives can find better quality
accommodation in Lisbon or Oporto though at prices closer to those in other
European cities.
Office space is a problem and prices are high though after 1992 they should
stabilise as more commercial property comes on the market.
Bureaucracy and red tape are infuriating, though the right connections will
usually help speed matters, but not always.
Brush a local government official the wrong way, and the water link that you
so desperately need will be dammed at source by forms and unanswered
letters. Construction work is slow and requires constant supervision; delays
are common.
Appointments will often be changed, sometimes at the very last minute, and
few will actually start on time playing havoc with business schedules.
Minor officials can be wrong-headed and infused with an exaggerated sense of
their own importance. Service, especially in the state sector, is bad -
reflecting the fact that many state employees are poorly paid and trained.
Taxi drivers are probably among the rudest in the world and you will be
lucky to get a grunt back as an acknowledgement after you mention your
destination.
Finding a garage to park your car is difficult and expensive, but it could
save having to pay for broken windows and stolen car radios if you leave
your car in the street, even if you live in a smart part of town.
If you are planning to live outside Lisbon and drive in, travel before or
after the rush hour to avoid long jams. And always drive defensively  -
Portuguese drivers are among the worst and probably the most dangerous in
Europe, giving Portugal the highest proportion of fatal road accidents in
the Community. Insurance premiums are high.
But for all these drawbacks, there are big compensations. Apart from four
months between December and April when it can rain torrentially for days and
temperatures are low, the climate is mild, the summers long and hot, and the
beach is never very far away.
At the height of the tourist season, it is best to avoid the main resorts
along the Algarve, but there are still many places left to visit along the
coast and in the interior.
From the green hills of the Minho where vinho verde (red and white) is
produced in the north, along the Douro river and valley that runs downhill
from Spain in the east through stunning landscape to Oporto, through the
Serra da Estrela mountains in the centre, and south, across the Alentejo,
with its miles of practically-deserted beaches and torrid interior
landscape, there is plenty to delight and discover.
Portugal has much to offer those who like to live outdoors. There is a wide
choice of sea food and some good wines, and once off-duty a temporary
resident can enjoy a pleasant and relaxed lifestyle.

Step by step to private ownership - Case study, Banco Totta &amp; Acores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT happens when a state-owned bank becomes private, and how does it
prepare for the change?
For Mr Alipio Barrosa Pereira Dias, president of the Banco Totta &amp; Acores
(BTA), the first Portuguese bank to be privatised, save for about 16 per
cent remaining in state hands, privatisation was a crucial factor for the
bank's future development not just because of the change in ownership, but
because it enabled the bank to do several things that it could not do
before.
The privatisation itself took place in three separate stages: an initial
floation on the stock exchange of 49 per cent of the bank's share capital in
July 1989, followed just over a year later with the sale of anothger 31 per
cent stake.
A capital increase last December, finally brought the private shareholding
in the bank to above 84 per cent.
Despite government limits on the purchase of privatised shares by
foreigners, Banesto, the Spanish banking group, managed to build up directly
and indirectly a controlling interest in the bank.
Today, Banesto holds directly around 10 per cent of the shares, while
Valores Ibericos - a joint venture with a Portuguese partner in which it
holds 49 per cent, has another 28 per cent. Other shareholders are small and
in practice Banesto has effective control of the bank.
From the very begining, the privatisation had a dramatic impact on the bank.
First and foremost, it allowed it to strengthen its capital base and grow.
Like all Portuguese state-owned banks that were nationalised in 1975, BTA
had seen its need for fresh capital frustrated by the unwillingness of
successive governments to provide new funds.
A weak capital base was a common problem for the nationalised banks. It was
a double handicap at a time when a system of credit ceilings - established
in the late 1970s and only recently abandoned - limited the amount a bank
was allowed to lend on the basis of its capitalisation.
With expansion thus constrained, BTA had to face increasingly tough
competition from new foreign and private Portuguese banks allowed to operate
once more after an initial liberalisation of the banking system in 1984.
By 1989, the need for fresh capital had become urgent if the bank was going
to remain competitive and grow. Privatisation came just at the right moment.
'It became possible to raise the bank's capital and with more capital we
could expand our activities. This was the most important effect of
privatisation,' Mr Dias says.
Paradoxically, the credit ceilings now started to work in BTA's favour. The
state-owned banks which were denied new injections of funds from the
government could only strengthen their own capital base either by issuing
limited amounts of participation certificates, or by ploughing back into the
bank what profits the state as main shareholder would decide to leave them.
This clearly hampered their development, which was already more difficult
because of their heavy burden oif bad debts, inefficient structures and
overstaffing.
The second most important effect was to give the bank a new sense of
direction.
Mr Dias who had joined BTA in 1988, prepared a new strategic plan for the
bank aimed at modernising operations, improving research and internal
controls, increasing the number of branches, and making more efficient use
of human resources.
Staff had to be reduced and productivity raised, older employees were
retired early or retrained.
Whereas in December 1987 the bank had on average 37 employees per branch,
this is now down to 23 employees.
The total number of employees has been reduced from about 4,500 in 1988 to
4,200 today in spite of an increase in the number of branches from 127 in
February 1988 to 173 now.
Mr Dias says he expects to open up another 10 to 15 branches by the end of
this year. Productivity has risen dramatically, helped by the introduction
of new computing and software systems.
Privatisation also meant changes in the image of the bank and in the
attitude of its employees.
'Sometimes it was simple things, like employees coming to work in casual
clothes without a tie. We had to explain to them this gave the bank a bad
image. But you couldn't legislate this, you had to win their cooperation,'
he says.
Another problem was the length of the privatisation process. For a period of
months, the future of the bank and of its shareholding structure remained
uncertain. This made it especially important for the bank's management to
maintain the full confidence of both the financial authorities and of its
staff.
'It was crucial during the privatisation to make people understand the need
for the process,' Mr Dias says.
Consultations and persuasion created a better climate than edicts from above
and sackings, though some lay-offs were inevitable.
But over a year and a half after the initial part-privatisation, Mr Dias
feels he has overcome the biggest obstacles - 'now we compete on equal terms
with the private banks. By next year we'll be in a position to do much
more.'

Fragile but promising - David Waller on the stock market's development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE THE mid-eighties, the Portuguese stock market has been through an
exaggerated surge of business and endured a severe collapse. Only now, with
a package of reforms due to be put in place this summer, are optimistic
observers saying the market has calmed down after the excesses of the past
half-decade.
Six years ago, the market barely existed. There was a stock exchange, but
volume was minuscule and there had not been a rights issue since before the
1974 revolution. All this changed in 1985-1986. The minority Social Democrat
government stimulated business confidence. Portugal joined the European
Community. A bull market was born.
'The market took off in 1985-86 and carried on rising until October 1987,'
says Joao Rendeiro, managing director of Gestifundo, a Lisbon-based
securities house. 'In the run-up to the election in June 87 there was
incredible euphoria. In other countries, the bull market took 10 years to
build up. Here the whole process was concertinaed into just six months.'
From 1983 to 1987, the number of quoted companies rose from 41 to 176; the
value of share transactions rose from Esc 5.7bn (Dollars 39m) to Esc
282.4bn. The total value of securities issued on the capital markets soared.
The Banco Totta e Acores (BTA) index began 1987 at 1,220, rose to a peak of
6,812 just before the crash, but fell back to 2,990 by the end of the year.
If it took a relatively short time for Portugal to enjoy a bull market, it
has taken correspondingly longer for the market to revive after the crash.
There have been two serious attempts at rallies, but the index ended last
year at 2143.4, a fall of 34.6 per cent in local currency terms over 1990
and still well below its level at the end of 1987.
'After the crash Portuguese investors sold in panic like anywhere else,'
says Mr Rendeiro, 'but all the weaknesses of a fragile infrastructure came
to the forefront dramatically. There was a huge shift in sentiment and for
more than a year afterwards the market continued to sink downwards as
investors tried to come to grips with the mess left by October 1987.'
The post-crash problems have been psychological and structural.
Psychological, because local investors had their fingers severely burned in
October 1987 and thereafter proved reluctant to get into the market.
Structural, because of an antiquated settlement system and a lack of
liquidity in the majority of stocks, which has discouraged all but the
bravest of foreign investors.
Although the number of companies quoted on the exchanges of Lisbon and
Oporto rose from 135 to 182 between 1987 and 1990, the bulk of activity is
concentrated on a dozen liquid stocks. Just 10 stocks - including Soporcel
(a pulp and paper company), Sonae (an industrial holdings company), Radio
Marconi Portuguesa (telecommunications), Banco Comercial Portugues, and
Banco Portugues de Investimento accounted for 52 per cent of the market's
capitalisation at the end of 1990, while trading in these shares invariably
accounts for most of the average daily Dollars 5-Dollars 6m turnover.
In January this year, the government finally approved a package of reforms
meant to remedy some of the structural defects of the market. The main
features are:
The setting up of a Securities &amp; Exchange Commission as the main regulatory
and supervisory body;
The privatisation and unification of the markets in Lisbon and Oporto. The
two trading floors will remain but in future each will be managed by an
association of local brokers and dealers who will be responsible for setting
up an investors' compensation scheme;
The creation of a central depository and settlement system;
The implementation of a new paperless trading system, at first only for the
blue-chips, eventually for the market as a whole, giving investors
continuous stock prices; and rules and penalties on insider dealing,
takeovers and mergers; share manipulation and disclosure rules.
The package will be implemented in June at the earliest; preliminary reforms
were introduced earlier this year (when the two exchanges introduced a
second daily price-fixing for the most liquid stocks) and at the beginning
of this month when a new partially computerised trading system was
introduced in Lisbon.
'The initial impact of the stock market reform is difficult to assess,' says
Mari Vargas, a London-based analyst at BNP Securities, 'but it should bring
greater efficiency and liquidity to stock exchange transactions for the
benefit of investors.
'Costs are also expected to go down . . . and the major foreign
institutional investors, including the Americans, that have been reluctant
to face the difficult trading conditions should reconsider their investment
decisions.'
Foreign investors, while accounting for much of the turnover, and owning 15
per cent of the market by market capitalisation (at the end of September
1990), were net sellers in the fourth quarter of 1990.
The market's recovery in the first months of this year - up from 1986 at its
lowest point in mid-January to 2515 - is thought to be driven by domestic
investors awash with cash because of the delayed privatisation programme.
A revival of this programme in the months ahead will soak up that demand and
is likely to tempt back foreign investors who have traditionally been keen
on new issues.
As the early privatisations will be banks and insurance companies, the
market's heavy skewing towards financial services will be exacerbated: large
sectors of the economy such as property and tourism are under-represented,
while banks alone accounted for 39 per cent of the market's capitalisation
at the end of last year.
The Portuguese market is the EC's smallest stock market and last year was
the worst performer. But it gives investors the opportunity to invest in a
small but dynamic economy.
Thus, if the market is still fragile, it certainly has potential - 'for the
first time in five years, stocks and p/e ratios are in line with
international standards,' says Mr Rendeiro.
'Prices react to events and information in a normal way. For the first time
we begin to have a real market.'

LEICA camera bodies, the most expensive and prestigious in the world, are
made in Germany. But an important part of their manufacture, together with
the full production of high-precision binoculars and microscopes, is carried
out near the town of Vila Nova de Familicao in north-west Portugal.
Here, 500 employees match their German colleagues for quality and are only
marginally behind in productivity, according to Mr Wolfgang Koch, the
group's general manager for Portugal. The only difference between the
Portuguese plant and Leica's two factories near Frankfurt is that labour
costs are 65 per cent lower.
'We would not be in the market at all if it were not for our lower wage
costs in Portugal,' says Mr Koch. Leica, now owned by Cambridge Instruments
of the UK and Switzerland's Wild group, set up a subsidiary in Portugal in
1973 when the pressure of Japanese competition forced the company to choose
between cutting costs or closing down.
The Portuguese operation, Leica Aparelhos Optica de Precisao, has since
increased its workforce more than twentyfold, investing a total of Es1.5bn
(Dollars 10.6m) over the past five years.
Two new factory units were recently opened, raising the value of the
company's exports to Es3bn a year. Management is now considering negotiating
a new investment contract with the Portuguese Institute of Foreign Trade
(ICEP).
Leica's success in Portugal bears out the assertion of Mr Antonio Neto da
Silva, the secretary of state for foreign trade, that, 'allied to efficient
management and modern technology, Portuguese workers achieve productivity
and quality levels to equal the best in Europe'.
Twelve German technicians work at the Vila Nova de Familicao plant. But the
head of the quality department is Portuguese.
'They like to say he is more German than the Germans,' says Mr Koch. Local
women, who make up 60 per cent of the workforce, show particular prowess at
close precision work.
'The calibre of our workers; their willingness to learn skills and work hard
is one of the most satisfying aspects of being in Portugal,' says Mr Koch.
Low costs and high productivity such as those enjoyed by Leica are drawing
other foreign investors to Portugal in record numbers. Direct foreign
investment grew to Es509bn (Dollars 3.6bn) in 1990, a 46-per cent increase
on the previous year - the increase in dollar terms was over 60 per cent.
Most investment originated from Britain, followed by France and Spain.
German investment, in fourth place, increased more than fourfold to Es60bn.
Foreign companies already established in Portugal accounted for 56 per cent
of the total through capital increases and expansion projects.
Heavyweight projects such as the Es27.5bn investment by Continental of
Germany in a tyre manufacturing joint venture made the headlines. But only
two out of a total of 3,500 foreign investment projects went above Es10bn.
'It is the small and medium-sized foreign investments that are providing our
industrial fabric with density and critical mass,' says Mr Miguel Athayde
Marques, vice-president of ICEP.
Besides illustrating the comparative advantages that are pulling foreign
investors to Portugal, the Leica subsidiary is also a prime example of why
the government is so keen to attract them.
The high-tech, high value-added plant is set in the Vale do Ave, the most
depressed industrial region in the country, where the government estimates
45,000 jobs could be lost by 2000 as textile, clothing and footwear
companies - Portugal's principal sources of export revenue - fall victim to
increased competition.
'Investment in new areas with a high technological component is vital for
the structural adjustment of Portuguese industry and the efficient
reallocation of manpower and resources,' says Mr Athayde Marques.
The sectors pinpointed by the government as having the most potential for
investment are information technology and electronics, biotechnology and
pharmaceuticals, technical ceramics, special purpose plastics, medical
equipment, agribusiness, cars and components, equipment and machinery,
sporting goods and tourism.
Foreign investment in such areas has been highly beneficial to the
Portuguese economy over the past six years. Exports are becoming
increasingly less dependent on the labour-intensive, low value-added sectors
of clothing and shoes and moving into more technologically sophisticated
areas.
Foreign manufacturers are forming upstream links with local suppliers. Their
demanding requirements are helping to promote the upgrading of Portuguese
companies, forcing them to improve their performance in terms of
specifications, quality, and delivery times.
The benefits are also being felt in Portugal's backward agricultural sector
where productivity is less than a third of average EC levels. The Plein Sud
group of the French entrepreneur Mr Thierry Roussel recently launched the
first stage of a planned Dollars 100m investment in two large farms to
produce off-season fruit and vegetables in the southern Alentejo, and plants
and flowers in northern Portugal. Both farms use modern production and
management techniques that contrast dramatically with traditional methods.
The Lisbon government's eagerness to capture foreign investment is backed by
attractive investment incentives for projects considered to have a positive
structural impact. According to the Institute for the Support of Small and
Medium-sized Industries (IAPMEI), foreign investors account for 16 per cent
of the Es149bn that has been awarded in investment incentives since two
EC-funded grant schemes were launched at the beginning of 1989.
That percentage is likely to undergo a substantial increase if a plan by
Ford Europe and Volkwagen to invest more than Es300bn to manufacture a new
multipurpose passenger vehicle in Portugal goes ahead. Officials are waiting
for Brussels to approve finance for an incentive package reportedly worth
between Esc 100bn and Esc 130bn before finalising the project.
The Portuguese Confederation of Industry complains this will be equal to the
amount of incentives awarded to Portuguese companies over the past three
years and has called for more support for local industry.
But government officials say the amount of incentives for the
Ford/Volkswagen plant has been exaggerated. They defend the project, which
will be the largest single foreign investment ever made in Portugal, not
only for the 5,300 jobs it will create directly but for the structural
impact it will have on the economy as a whole, increasing the value of
exports with the planned production of 173,000 vehicles a year, promoting
the growth of supply industries and indirectly creating thousands of other
new jobs.

Independence strengthened - Patrick Blum discusses the central bank's
changing role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM

<TEXT>
SINCE 1984, Portugal's financial system has been through more change than
any other sector of the economy. New private banks and financial
institutions sprung up from nowhere to become leading players on the
domestic market, offering new services, using more modern methods, and
bringing fresh ideas to shake the complacency of the state-owned and
state-run banking establishment. Deregulation gradually helped open up
markets and the economy to international market forces.
Liberalisation was given a further push by European Community membership and
the need to meet requirements for financial services and institutions. By
1992, Portugal will have to comply with the bulk of EC directives on the
liberalisation of the financial system except for short-term capital
movements for which it has won a reprieve likely to last for another two to
three years.
The Banco de Portugal (central bank) which for years after the 1974
revolution had been little more than a conveyor belt for Finance Ministry
edicts has not escaped the movement for reform, winning a new, more
independent lease of life.
It is now undergoing a programme of important changes that has already
strengthened its independence and improved its operations. Mr Jose Alberto
Tavares Moreira, the bank's governor, says that within three to four years
the reform will be completed and the bank will have radically changed
structures.
'At the end of that period we'll have a structure composed of six main
departments organised on the basis of the essential functions of the bank,
compared with 19 departments when we started with the reform, and 12
departments now,' he says. The six departments will be responsible
separately for economic research, the money markets, foreign exchange
operations, banking supervision, staff and administration, and issuing
currency. Each one will have its own director.
The streamlining of functions will be accompanied with a streamlining of
staff which will be reduced from about 3,000 at the start of the reform
almost two years ago (now 2,300) to about 2,000 employees.
But at least as important for the bank are the reforms outlined in a draft
law approved last autumn enhancing its autonomy. While Portugal's central
bank will not be as independent as Germany's Bundesbank, it will be more
independent than the Bank of England or the Banque de France.
In the past, the central bank was independent only in theory. It was
described as the country's issuing bank, responsible for foreign exchange
regulations and currency management, as well as for the orientation and
control of monetary policy, but with an important proviso: that it would
carry out all these functions 'within the guidelines' established by the
Finance Ministry. And while it could give its opinion on monetary and fiscal
policy, in practice the last word always belonged to the government. The
bank was essentially an administrative, and at times, political, instrument
of government.
In what was a highly regulated financial environment the central bank acted
as a gendarme to ensure that the minutiae of economic and monetary policy
dictated by the Finance Ministry in great detail was properly enforced.
Under its new statutes, it has won far greater freedom of action and is
required to fulfil its functions 'taking into account' government policies.
It 'collaborates in defining' monetary and exchange rate policy and 'keeps a
watch over the stability of the financial system'. It advises on monetary
and financial policy, and is responsible for supervising the monetary,
financial and foreign exchange markets.
It is also no longer obliged, as in the past, to lend funds to the
government. It was not uncommon for a government suddenly pressed for cash
to ask the bank for the money. This was a convenient way for governments to
hide part of their indebtedness and raise money cheaply since interest rates
were set administratively. The bank could argue, but in practice it could
not reject a government request for credit.
The bank's management and the position of its governor have also been
strengthened and given greater responsibilities. In the past the bank's only
authority was its collective management board of which the governor was an
administrative chairman, but under the new statutes the governor's role and
authority have been enhanced.

Painful changeover - Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGAL is grossly under-insured by the standards of the European
Community.
According to a study conducted by Arthur Andersen, total premiums in 1989
amounted to Es220bn (USDollars 1.5bn), which works out at about 3 per cent
of GDP - less than half the EC average. Premiums per head are around
one-eighth of the level of the rest of Europe.
The opportunities for such an underdeveloped sector are enormous, especially
in view of Portuguese people's high propensity to save. Recognising this,
the number of insurance companies operating in Portugal has risen from 50 in
1986 to 65 now and an estimated 75 by the end of the year.
Like the banking sector, the insurance industry was owned and controlled by
the state until the mid-1980s. The pace of change has been slower, though,
than in banking and deregulation has in many cases brought pain rather than
prosperity.
The market is extremely concentrated - the six biggest companies account for
approximately 70 per cent of the industry. In 1986, all were state-owned; by
now one is totally private, another is in the throes of privatisation, and
three more are to be sold off by the end of next year.
Between 1984 and 1989, the state relinquished its control over tariffs in
segment after segment of the insurance market. This ushered in an era of
fierce price competition, which according to Mr Ruy de Carvalho, president
of the Portuguese Insurers' Association, lingers on still.
Thus, in sectors such as motor insurance, big-ticket industrial insurance
and workmen's compensation, premiums have fallen dramatically recently.
'After decades of control competition is now very lively,' Mr Carvalho
acknowledges.
It is in the life sector that premiums rose most comfortably last year, by
26 per cent, twice the rate of inflation. It is the life business which
offers the biggest opportunity for profitable expansion. This accounts for
only 20 per cent of the market against an average of 40 per cent across the
EC.
In total, the life market grew from Es45.5bn to 69bn over 1989-90 and the
non-life from 175.5bn to 221bn.
New companies - such as Ocidental Seguros, the insurance subsidiary of the
Banco Comercial Portugues - have tended to concentrate on life. Older ones -
like Fidelidade, Portugal's second largest insurer now owned by the giant
Caixa Geral - are scurrying to form distribution links with the banks. This
form of selling is gradually replacing the army of agents who act as
intermediaries.
Mirroring the success of its parent company in the banking sector, Ocidental
has come from nowhere to be the 14th largest insurance company. Seguros
predicts its premium income will grow by 80 per cent this year, an
indication of the vigour of the life business.
The company would occupy a higher position still if motor insurance were
stripped out. This accounts for a substantial proportion of the premium
income generated by the top six insurers but, according to Mr Joao Talone,
president of Ocidental, losses in this segment of the market amounted to
Es7bn last year.
The total profit across the sector was Es6 - 7bn last year. Talone says that
two thirds of this is not trading profit - 'the only thing the big companies
can do is cut their rates to keep market share,' he comments. 'They have
made most of their money by selling properties in the middle of a bull or by
selling shares bought long before the 1974 revolution.
'All the big insurers are engaged in window-dressing to make themselves look
good for privatisation,' he says.
'The state sector companies are hampered from doing deals with banks to
secure distribution channel for life products,' he continues. 'Nobody knows
who's going to end-up owning whom. We are selling well into our own bank
because we are part of the same culture. They have been forced to compete
very strongly without having the tools to take the necessary strategic
decisions.'
Mr Jose Antonio Santos Texeira, president of Imperio, the largest insurance
company in Portugal and yet to be privatised, rejects any suggestion that
the state sector is grossly inefficient.
He admits, however, that the company is handicapped by its public-sector
status.
Mr Texeira would like to have a bank and a large foreign insurance company
as shareholders. Rivals comment that the problem with the privatisation
programme is that the state will demand a high price for its insurance
assets, but will want control to remain in the hands of the Portuguese. The
trouble may be that only outsiders will be willing to pay the price.
Foreign interest in the sector is high: Andersen calculated that Portuguese
companies will have less than 60 per cent of the market by 1995. The main
foreign entrants are from France and Spain, and they have considerably
greater financial muscle. Ruefully, Mr Texeira says that his company's
capital amounts to Pounds 2.5m, compared to the Pounds 1bn of UAP, the
French group which has acquired Garantia, Portugal's seventh largest
insurance company, and which is poised to take control of Alianca, another
state-owned insurer - when its privatisation is finally completed.

Serious underlying problems - Although the economy appears to have performed
remarkably well, Patrick Blum discovers . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT FIRST sight Portugal's economy appears to have performed remarkably well.
Last year, the gross domestic product grew by 4.4 per cent, exports surged,
investment was up by 8.7 per cent with direct foreign investment rising by
more than 60 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn, the current account balance closed
with a hardly noticeable Dollars 61m deficit, and unemployment was below 5
per cent. Only inflation, at 13.4 per cent for the year, appeared to cloud
the horizon.
Yet, in spite of the good news which merited praise from the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European
Commission, there remain serious underlying problems of which inflation -
which officials seem at times to perceive as only a temporary difficulty
caused by too much success - is just one.
True, exports are rising, but not as much and not sufficiently fast to
overcome an enduring trade deficit. Merchandise imports have grown much
faster than exports. The value of imports of goods rose by 31.5 per cent
from Dollars 17.6bn in 1989 to Dollars 23bn last year, while the value of
exports of goods grew by a sturdy but more modest 25.2 per cent from Dollars
12.7bn in 1989 to Dollars 16.4bn. The deficit in traded goods rose by almost
35 per cent in 1990, resuming an upward trend that had been reversed in
1989.
It will not be easy to overcome this imbalance, although some important
manufacturing projects now under way will help in the future. But for the
time being, Portuguese manufactured goods tend, with few exceptions, to be
of lower quality and geared to the mass market. Inefficient production
methods are compensated for by the lowest labour costs in the Community,
Portugal's largest market. But that comparative advantage is being
increasingly eroded as competition from other EC and non-EC producers
becomes more intense, and as wages rise to come more into line with those in
the rest of Europe.
Mr Jose Alberto Tavares Moreira, governor of the Banco de Portugal (central
bank), argues that the growth in exports demonstrates that Portuguese
industry is becoming more competitive: 'In spite of the strong appreciation
of the escudo we have managed to have a current account practically in
surplus. This shows that there has been a considerable restructuring of the
economy. There have been extensive productivity gains."
That is true in some industries though the extent and significance of the
restructuring is less certain. Traditional sectors such as textiles or
agriculture - the two biggest areas of activity - are deeply in crisis.
Repeated complaints about high interest rates - at between 21 per cent and
23 per cent for prime corporate clients for a year, or 24 per cent to 26 per
cent for small companies - and recurrent calls for help from Portuguese
business groups in the face of foreign competition suggest that industry
remains deeply apprehensive about the future.
The current account has improved with the latest figures for 1989 showing a
surplus of Dollars 139m instead of the forecast deficit of Dollars 550m, and
initial - likely to be revised - figures for 1990 showing a deficit of
Dollars 61m compared to a forecast deficit of Dollars 1.2bn. But this was
achieved not simply because exports grew - though that helped - but in large
part because of higher than expected earnings from tourism, up by almost 30
per cent from Dollars 2.1bn in 1989 to Dollars 2.7bn last year, and higher
emigrants remittances worth Dollars 4.2bn.
For Portugal to be able to benefit fully from European integration and
European economic and monetary union (EMU) inflation must be brought under
control and the inflation differential between Portugal and its European
partners reduced. But while inflation was brought down from its 1984 peak of
nearly 30 per cent to an annual rate of 9.4 per cent in 1987, it has edged
back up since then.
Mr Miguel Beleza, the finance minister, appointed more than a year ago, is
more cautious than his predecessor when it comes to forecasts, but his own
10.5 per cent target, later revised to 11 per cent, still fell short of the
13.4 per cent annualised average rate actually achieved - more than double
the European average.
This year, the government hopes to bring down inflation to a maximum 11 per
cent. Mr Tavares Moreira says this is feasible though it will be difficult
because of strong demand pressure. 'It is not easy to deflate an economy
under these conditions,' he says.
There are signs that price rises may have slowed a little with the
annualised average rate in February falling 0.1 of a percentage point to
13.3 per cent, but this is still a long way from the 8 per cent which he
says would be desirable to bring the escudo into the Exchange Rate Mechanism
(ERM) of the European Monetary System (EMS), a move the government would
like to make as soon as possible.
Another factor may now also be entering the inflation equation. In recent
years, wages have lagged behind rather than led inflation, but this could be
changing. An agreement last autumn between the government and some of the
unions to keep wage increases to 13.5 per cent may limit rises in the state
sector, but low unemployment and labour scarcity, especially in parts of the
private sector, is causing strong upward pressure with pay deals this year
reaching 16 per cent. Yet wages must go up if higher productivity gains are
to be achieved.
The government is caught between conflicting pressures. In the past,
interest rates were kept high administratively as part of efforts to curb
credit demand and consumption to fight inflation. Now, with moves towards
market set rates, the main and enduring cause of high interest rates remains
the budget deficit which represents between 6.5 per cent and 7 per cent of
GDP. Government borrowing effectively sets the rates for the market.
Privatisations which last year brought the government an extra income of
nearly Dollars 1bn, cannot help since revenue from the sale of state-owned
assets cannot be used to finance the budget. Meanwhile, high interest rates
and a stable currency encourage capital inflows thereby adding to
inflationary pressures.
Moreover, as the economy is opened up and the financial system is
liberalised it is increasingly difficult for the authorities to control
capital movements. Short-term capital inflows proved especially troublesome
last year having increased from Dollars 770m in 1989 to Dollars 1.8bn which
represented more than one third of all capital movements in 1990. To
discourage these mainly speculative capital movements the authorities
tightened up foreign exchange rules and allowed greater fluctuations in the
value of the escudo by ending the practice of maintaining a 'crawling peg'
according to which the escudo was depreciated by 0.25 per cent a month. The
immediate effect, however, was to send the escudo up rather than down.
So those hoping for a depreciation of the escudo are unlikely to see their
wishes satisfied. 'We have to see the exchange rate level on a long-term
basis, and (on that basis) the escudo is about right at the moment,' Mr
Tavares Moreira says, adding, 'there is no alternative to maintaining a very
firm monetary policy'. And that means the squeeze between high real interest
and exchange rates is likely to continue.

Spanish banks invade - Patrick Blum records the end of an era for Lloyds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETIME soon the distinctive rich, blue colours of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
(BBV), Spain's biggest banking group, will be hoisted on to the front of the
modern headquarters of Lloyds Bank Portugal on Lisbon's busy Avenida da
Liberdade.
The occasion will mark the end of an era for the British bank which put down
its first roots in Portugal in 1865 as the Anglo Portuguese Bank, later
transformed into the Bank of London and South America, and which has
operated under its present name since the 1970s.
One of the few banks to escape the 1975 revolution's sweeping
nationalisations, Lloyds kept and developed a small but highly profitable
business niche in the country.
When the bank's sale to BBV for Pounds 110m is approved by the Portuguese
authorities, it will also highlight the recent inroads made by Spanish banks
into the Portuguese market. It is not quite a flood, but it is already a
good deal more than a trickle.
Apart from BBV, Banesto has bought a leading stake in Banco Totta &amp; Acores
(BTA), Banco Santander has a substantial share of Banco de Comercio e
Industria (BCI), and Banco Exterior de Espana has a main branch in Lisbon
and plans to open several more branches this year.
Furthermore, Banco Hispano Americano is waiting for authorisation to
transform its Portuguese investment company into a bank, Banco Central has a
representative office and a standing request for a branch and several
regional savings banks have representations in Portugal.
All this, of course, excludes specialised investment, leasing and real
estate companies.
But whereas most Spanish banks chose either to build up their stakes
gradually in local institutions as Banesto has done through BTA's
privatisation or start from scratch with an investment or fund management
company, BBV has taken a different route by buying up an existing private
bank with a small but well-established network of a dozen branches.
It was an unexpected move, but one which fitted the Spanish group's
strategy. Mr Gonzalo Terreros, BBV international manager, says the bank
wanted to be in the Portuguese market to offer universal banking services
with an emphasis on corporate and private banking.
He sees Portugal as a rapidly expanding market with reactions similar to the
Spanish market in the early 1980s.
'Spain and Portugal are the fastest growing areas in Europe,' he says.
Lloyds was chosen after a study of various other possibilities including
that of buying a bank that was being privatised. This was discarded as too
slow, too uncertain, and as a potential source of conflict with the
Portuguese authorities.
BBV wanted to avoid the controversy that surrounded Banesto's move into BTA
as well as the need to have to negotiate with too many diversified
shareholders.
At the same time it was not seeking a commercial bank with a large branch
network. For size and nature of its business Lloyds fitted BBV's ambitions.
Calculating that Lloyds which had been cutting back on its international
operations may be willing to sell, BBV approached the bank and was able to
clinch a deal within a relatively short time.
'We were sure that the bank would be healthy, productive and without bad
surprises. So the Lloyds trademark was a guarantee,' Mr Terreros said.
Another of the bank's assets with BBV was that although Lloyds was not a
typical retail bank, it had a network of branches and operated in all BBV's
target markets: wholesale and retail banking with a good corporate customer
base in the state and private sectors, among medium and small companies, and
with a solid private clientele of high net worth individuals.
Since 1986, Lloyds has more than doubled its total assets which where valued
at Es87.3bn at the end of last year with profits of Es1.2bn.
Once it is authorised to transform the bank into a 100 per cent BBV-owned
Portuguese subsidiary it intends to build on the bank's present strengths
and seek to capture a greater chunk of the market among small and
medium-size companies and among private customers.
'We think we will be able to develop immediately new products, new customers
and markets, and compete with highly attractive products in those parts of
the market that are growing very fast,' Mr Terreros says.
Plans are to increase the number of branches to around 35 within 18 months.
In the longer-term, the goal is to establish BBV as an important Portuguese
bank with 'a Portuguese team and character, not a marginal foreign bank'.

Preparing for turbulence - The Banking Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE past five years the Portuguese banking sector has risen swiftly from
a very low base. The question troubling bankers now is whether the growth
can continue in the years to come.
'There have been five terrific years of banking,' reflects Mr Carlos
Rodrigues, president of Manufacturers Hanover (Portugal). Margins have been
high, competition from the state-owned banks - which even after the latest
privatisations account for 75 per cent of the sector - less than vigorous.
Up until earlier this year, the financial authorities maintained a strict
credit ceiling on bank lending. According to Mr Timothy Bradbury, managing
director of Lloyds Bank, Portugal (recently bought by BBV, Spain's largest
bank), this meant that corporate customers 'were competing to borrow. In the
meantime, the private banks could buy liquidity from the public banks and
lend it out under their own credit ceiling.'
Even now, savers are paid 14-15 per cent on their deposits, subject to 20
per cent withholding tax, which works out at less than inflation. Banks then
lend out the funds at 26 per cent retail and 22 per cent wholesale. With
such handsome margins, it is not surprising that the banks have prospered.
The growth of the sector as a whole is captured in the extraordinary story
of Banco Comercial Portugues. When the bank started in 1986, it had 205
shareholders, capital of Esc 3.5bn and 255 employees. Now it has nearly
25,000 shareholders, capital of Esc 66bn and it employs 2,500 people.
There is more turnover in BCP shares on the Lisbon stock exchange than in
any other company's shares. Coming from nowhere five years ago, BCP is now
one of Europe's top 100 banks in terms of capital strength and one of the 60
largest in terms of market capitalisation.
The banking industry today cannot be understood without remembering that in
1975 all Portuguese banks were nationalised. It was not until ten years
later that the government promoted legislation allowing private banks to be
set up. The first stage of deregulation drew six foreign banks into Portugal
within 18 months, and local entrepreneurs founded four banks, of which BCP
is the best-known.
This sudden influx of competition had a profound effect on the sleepy public
sector banks. They were exposed as not merely grossly inefficient by
European standards - they had more employees per branch than any other
European country and fell behind by all other yardsticks  - but downright
insolvent.
'Throughout the 1970s and early '80s, we had a social role and we were not
driven by normal financial and economic goals,' reflects Mr Pedro Rebelo de
Sousa, president of the Banco Fonsecas &amp; Burnay, a state-owned bank which is
hoping to be privatised later this year. By the mid-1980s, the consequences
of this uncommercial approach were clear: the average percentage of bad
credit to total loan portfolios among the state-owned banks had climbed to
20 per cent.
'Many of the borrowers simply didn't exist,' quips one banker. Add-in
unfunded pension liabilities and dubious accounting policies and the result
was most of the state-owned banks were insolvent.
The reaction of Fonsecas to the new environment is typical of that of the
whole state-owned sector. It shrunk its staff by 25 per cent. It shored up
its balance sheet by selling off properties amid a bull market for real
estate. It sorted out its provisions for bad debts and unfunded pension
liabilities. It has invested heavily in information technology.
Fonsecas now considers that it is virtually indistinguishable from
Portugal's private-sector banks. a feeling shared by the large state sector
banks such as Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa, which is also
hoping to be privatised later this year. The tidying up process completed,
these banks like to think of the state as just another shareholder.
In this vein, Mr Alipio Dias, president of the Banco Totta &amp; Acores, in
which the government retains a residual 15 per cent holding, says 'the
treasury is a shareholder like any other.' According to Mr Alexandre Vaz
Pinto, president of the Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa and the
chairman of the Portuguese Bankers' Association, the average percentage of
bad debts to loan portfolio is down to 14 per cent across the state-owned
sector.
More recently, the public and partially-public banks have shared in the
general prosperity of the sector. For example, the 85 per cent privatised
Banco Totta reported a 76 per cent increase in cash flow last and assets
were up 33 per cent, with profits rising from Esc 73m in 1985 to 3.26bn in
1989. This year the rise in cash flows will be less, but lower provisions
will mean that net profits rise by as much as 50 per cent.
The pattern is repeated at Caixa Geral de Depositos, the gargantuan
state-sector bank which on its own has 25-30 per cent of the Portuguese
banking market, a fact easy to understand when one considers that it has
8.5m customers out of a population of 10.5bn. Here, profits have risen from
Esc 8.9bn in 1984 to Esc 29.9bn in 1989, with cash flows rising from Esc
15.5bn to Esc 82.2bn.
Caixa, which will never leave the public sector, is planning an aggressive
branch-opening programme, and aims to increase its branches from 420 to 500
by the end of next year. Caixa is not alone in expanding its branch network
 -all the other banks are doing it too. This is but one symptom of
increasing competition in the banking sector.
The government has yet to deregulate its rules forbidding banks to offer
interest-bearing current accounts at anything paying anything other than
nominal rates. But relaxation of this rule is expected sooner or later.
Another factor behind the increasing competition is the presence of foreign
banks - in particular Spanish banks eager to repeat in Portugal the success
they have had on domestic territory. More significant, though, is the recent
abolition of the credit ceiling. This frees the banks' lending capacity.
Combined with increased competition in the market for retail deposits, it is
inevitable that banks' spreads and profit margins will narrow.
'When we were founded we realised we only had a limited time to reach a
certain dimension,' reflects Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, President of BCP.
'In 1985, we calculated that we wouldn't face intense competition for 5-7
years and that we could reach a certain market share by launching innovative
products and introducing new technology. We were were always clear that in
1992 and afterwards there would be intense competition from foreign and
domestic private banks.'
Competition from foreign banks will be restrained for as long as the
government keep in place its restrictions on short term capital flows.
Looking ahead, one banker reflects that the days of easy money are over  -
'it's going to be war out there,' he said, 'and it's going to be bloody.'

Tougher days ahead - As Portugal faces increasing political and economic
change, the time of easy successes for the financial community is over,
reports Patrick Blum. The sector is experiencing stronger competition from
abroad and further restructuring is needed
</HEADLINE>

Lisbon waterfront, the Finance Ministry, Stock Exchange and several
government departments are located in this area of the city. Lisbon is also
Portugal's chief port and lies on the right bamk of the Tagua River, 13 kms
from the river's entry into the Atlantic Ocean, at the westernmost fringe of
the European continent. Portugal's main towns and cities include Oporto,
Setubal, Colombra and Brage. Pictured below, Lisbon's main square, the Praca
do Comercio.
THIS YEAR is likely to go by unusually quickly for Portugal. First, it is
having to speed up the pace of reform to meet next year's European Community
deadlines for the internal market. It must prepare also for its first EC
presidency starting on January 1 - exactly six years after it joined the
Community.
Before that, a general election, due by October at the latest, will decide
whether Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister and leader of the ruling
Social Democratic party, remains in power for a third term of government.
At stake will be a particular model and style of government whose
achievements and shortcomings are likely to come under close scrutiny in the
run-up to the election.
The result of the vote cannot be forecast, but the tenant at the Sao Bento
prime ministerial residence will have his work cut out. Economic pressures
are building up in spite of some striking successes.
In the years that followed its accession to the Community, Portugal
benefited from propitious domestic circumstances, a favourable international
environment and considerable goodwill and assistance to help it modernise
and catch up with its European partners.
But it is still a relatively poor country, and after five years of rapid
growth and development, new problems have emerged and some old ones are
re-asserting themselves with a vengeance.
The good news is that Portugal continued to grow at a faster rate than any
of its European partners last year with the gross domestic product rising by
4.4 per cent. Investment, up by more than 8 per cent, remained sturdy, and
foreign investment rising by over 60 per cent was buoyant. Official
unemployment was negligible and industrial activity high. The current
account was almost balanced.
The bad news is that inflation at 13.4 per cent - more than twice the EC
average - resisted official efforts to bring it down.
The budget deficit at close to 7 per cent of GDP is proving equally
difficult to reduce, and it is keeping interest rates at punishingly high
levels squeezing industry. Traditional sectors from agriculture to textiles
are inefficient and facing their most serious crisis yet.
In the past few years, the government has carried out or began several
important reforms. A land reform has opened the way for privatising the
large collective farms, the gradual privatisation of companies nationalised
in 1975 and 1976 has started to reduce the weight of the public sector in
the economy, new labour laws have relaxed some of the rigidities of the
labour market and eased conditions for dismissals, a tax reform has made tax
collection more efficient, and the financial sector has seen the most
extensive liberalisation and deregulation of all, spurred along by the need
to meet the approaching 1992 deadline for an EC-wide internal market in
financial services. But there is still much to be done.
Mr Rui Machete, past minister in several governments, former president of
the Social Democratic party and the chairman of the parliament's budget,
finance and planning committee, identifies four areas in need of fundamental
structural change: agriculture, industry, social welfare and education.
Portuguese agriculture employs about 19 per cent of the active population
but accounts for only six per cent of gross domestic product. Fewer than 15
years ago, Portugal's population was predominantly rural, yet it cannot feed
itself and depends for more than half of its food on imports.
Part of the problem is due to an excessive division of the land into a
plethora of tiny unviable plots, mainly in the north, and inefficient huge
co-operative farms created after the revolution, mainly in the south.
Productivity is among the lowest in the EC and most farmers survive thanks
to generous subsidies. Mr Machete says the land structure and the system of
agricultural price subsidies will have to change, though he expects it will
take several years of transition.
Industry also faces the challenge of the internal market. Most Portuguese
companies remain unprepared for the inevitable increase in competition after
1992, and continue to rely on old production methods, low wages, and
outdated management methods. There are exceptions, and larger companies,
many of them foreign or with international links or partners, find they can
achieve productivity levels comparable to those in other European countries.
In contrast to the growing apprehension of some Portuguese business groups,
foreign investors exude optimism, seeing in Portugal's relative backwardness
the springboard for sustained and dynamic development.
In the long run, foreign investment can have a ripple effect throughout the
economy, encouraging the development of local suppliers and helping to raise
quality standards, but the adaptation will be difficult. A large number of
small and medium-size companies will face a straightforward choice:
modernise or close - many will probably have to close. Industrial
restructuring will inevitably lead to job losses which will have to be
alleviated through a more efficient and expanded social security system
since it will not be possible to retrain all displaced workers.
Education is in a sorry state. Teachers are underpaid, career conditions
unattractive and schools and colleges plagued with recurring strikes.
Illiteracy at anything between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the
population, depending on the statistics, is still widespread and educational
standards are generally low. As old industries give way to new ones or
modernise, training and retraining have become more important. The EC is
helping through its social fund to finance training in private industry. But
as Portugal prepares for the future, education will need greater resources
with more emphasis placed on quality.
Reducing the weight of the state in the economy is another huge task. In
economic terms, the state accounts for nearly 40 per cent of GDP, but its
weight in particular sectors is overwhelming. In the financial sector, it
still controls about 80 per cent of the market. Once the privatisation
programme is completed, the two big financial groups remaining in state
hands together will have between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of the market.
Privatisations are a key element in the government's strategy to reduce the
weight of the state and open the economy to market forces, but the process
has been slow and prone to delays.
Conditions are less favourable now than they were 18 months or a year ago,
investors have become more wary especially since share prices of privatised
companies have tended to fall below their original, often high, selling
price. This may not matter too much for big domestic or foreign groups whose
objective is to win market positions, but it has shaken the confidence of
smaller investors.
Diminishing the size of the state is only part of a wider need to reduce
bureaucracy and bureaucratic interference.
'There is an enormous bureaucracy run by incompetent people who interfere in
too many areas and in excessive detail,' says a senior businessman airing a
common complaint. Political parties and trade unions which should
counter-balance the state, often operate as if they were state institutions,
making it difficult at times to dissociate administrative from political
decisions.
'We've progressed and reached a higher stage of problems and issues to deal
with,' Mr Machete says. Some of the government's critics are less charitable
and argue it has wasted a unique opportunity since it had a free hand with
an absolute majority in parliament.
The truth probably lies somewhere in between: quite a lot has been achieved
but a lot more could have been done. Given the scale of the challenge, the
task of restructuring the economy and the state may have only barely began,
but the process will have to be accelerated if Portugal is to develop into a
modern and competitive economy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HINT of a weak performance on Wall Street sent UK stock index futures
scurrying lower yesterday and dragged the share market down in its wake.
A dearth of buyers initially left the London market vulnerable to
profit-taking. It then only took suggestions of a decline on Wall Street to
send equity futures still lower.
Brokers said the lack of buying made it difficult to execute even the small
number of institutional sell orders placed with them. Instead, turnover was
dominated by market professionals and securities houses.
There was also interest in FT-SE 100 index options, with some investors
short of futures buying April calls and others buying puts and selling
calls, all of which are deals that assume the equity market will weaken
further.
The June FT-SE futures contract traded for much of the session just 20
points above the spot index, compared with the 30-point premium brokers
estimate is necessary to take account of future dividend payments and
financing cost.
June FT-SE closed at 2,511, down 33 points on the day and 17 points above
the spot index.
Hanson August 220 and 240 calls were actively traded as investors in the
recent Euro- bond issue continued to sell calls as a hedging trade against
the bonds.
GEC August 200 puts were a busy contract as a large technical trade was
executed.

FT  23 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Weaker yen and bond
prices prompt profit-taking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE WEAKER yen and lower bond prices brought profit-taking by investment
trusts yesterday, but overall trading remained dull, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
Volume fell to 250m shares, dropping below 300m for the first time since
February 4. The Nikkei average, which lost 256.93 on Friday, fell a further
304.96 to 26,237.01, the day's low in spite of sporadic buying by
arbitrageurs. The index opened at the session's high of 26,492.45.
Declines overwhelmed rises by 818 to 164, with 151 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks fell 22.54 to 1,975.53, and in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 3.19 to 1,489.05.
Traders said the only activity of note was small-lot, short-term trading. Mr
Bill Wilder, director of research at Schroder Securities, said domestic
institutions were uncertain of the central bank's interest rate scenario due
to the weak yen. 'The market could be in the doldrums for another three
weeks, since the earliest possibility of a discount rate cut will be
mid-May,' he added.
The smaller markets, which attracted investors looking for quick profits
last week, retreated on profit-taking. The second section slipped 8.76 to
3,396.12 and the over-the-counter market fell 30.53 to 3,065.53.
Interest rate-sensitive issues also declined on profit-taking, with Nippon
Steel shedding Y9 to Y471. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone lost Y19,000 to
Y991,000, falling below the important Y1m level for the first time since
February 15.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries receded Y12 to Y771 on reports that it had
decided to write off Y30bn worth of bills receivable that are due from Iraq.
Chiyoda, the plant engineer, dipped Y30 to Y3,030 on profit-taking after
rising for the last three days.
Nihon Nohyaku, an agro-chemical manufacturer, rose Y70 to Y2,320 in heavy
trading. Some investors were attracted by rumours that speculative buying
has boosted the issue recently. Demand spread throughout the sector, with
Kumiai Chemical adding Y40 at Y1,200 and Hokko Chemical Y50 at Y1,240.
Securities houses weakened on concern that poor market conditions would
affect earnings. Daiwa Securities fell Y60 to Y1,350 and Nomura Securities
Y30 to Y2,140.
The land transportation sector was the worst performer of the day, losing
4.03 per cent. Traders attributed the weakness to the decline of Seino
Transport, which retreated Y150 to Y2,250 on selling by foreigners.
Medical equipment makers improved on reports of new requirements stipulating
that ambulances would have to carry electro-cardiographic equipment. Nihon
Kohden gained Y10 to Y1,430.
Iwasaki Electronics, a lamp maker, gained ground in the morning on reports
that it has developed an ultra-violet ray lamp which decomposes harmful
substances in pesticides used on golf courses, but closed unchanged at
Y1,260 on profit-taking.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 342.44 to 29,557.25 on volume of 21.4m
shares, down from Friday's 33.7m.
Roundup
A MIXED DAY for equities in the region emphasised the old saying that what
goes up must come down, with Hong Kong and Manila as the illustrations.
HONG KONG lost 2.3 per cent in heavy trading, but the 84.91 fall to 3,582.49
in the Hang Seng index, its lowest close in seven weeks, still left it
nearly 45 points above the day's low of 3,538. Turnover rose from HKDollars
1.22bn to HKDollars 1.41bn.
Dealers said London institutions were taking profits on currency, as well as
on the market. The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the ascending US dollar;
but support for the Hang Seng was lost after Mr Douglas Hurd, the British
foreign secretary, failed to secure an agreement from China on the colony's
HKDollars 100bn international airport plan earlier this month.
MANILA's downswing accelerated with a drop of 4.1 per cent, the composite
index sliding 44.38 to 1,027.12. Some observers blamed last week's Supreme
Court ruling which allowed industrialist Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, a close
associate of the late Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos, to vote his
sequestered shares in San Miguel, the brewer and market leader.
Turnover fell from 142.9m pesos to 95.9m. San Miguel declined 5.50 pesos to
52.50.
TAIWAN, in contrast, set a 10-month high in modest trading as an historic
political reform package was passed. The weighted index advanced 69.91 or
1.2 per cent to 5,824.00.
The index has climbed 510.69 or 9.6 per cent since last Wednesday. However,
turnover continued to dwindle yesterday, falling from TDollars 76.7bn to
TDollars 69.7bn.
JAKARTA, which has been criticised for not doing enough to protect
investors, tightened disclosure regulations for companies hoping to list on
the market. The official index, meanwhile, celebrated its return from a
week's holiday by rising 3.07 to 415.55 in heavy volume of 5.83m shares.

FT  23 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Mexico in pole position yet again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL STREET's historic breach of the 3,000 level changed the direction of
the FT-Actuaries World Index last week. Overall, it rose 0.3 per cent in
local currency terms. Excluding the US, the world was 0.1 per cent lower.
Japan held the world back in spite of reports in midweek that the central
bank was loosening its monetary policy. Speculation of an early cut in
interest rates was fanned by last Friday's release of better than expected
March money supply figures.
From a technical standpoint the Nikkei average was unable to break
decisively through the important 27,000 mark. Without Japan the world index
would have risen 0.7 per cent last week.
The best performer of the week and of the year to date was Mexico, which put
on 9.5 per cent and 62 per cent respectively in local currency terms. Mr
Jeremy Campbell-Lamerton of Baring Securities attributed the advance to
unabated buying of shares in Telmex, the telephone monopoly and a rise in
foreign investment on optimism that the Free Trade Agreement between the US
and Mexico will succeed.
The government is due to make an international offering of its remaining
Telmex shares next week, expected to raise over Dollars 2bn. Telmex has
risen over 50 per cent to over Dollars 3 in the last month and now accounts
for one-fifth of average daily market volume of Dollars 32m. However, it
showed signs of tiring last Friday, which could herald a much-needed rest
for the market, Mr Campbell-Lamerton says.
Interest rates continued to steer most stock markets last week. Hopes of an
early cut boosted Australia 5.1 per cent and New Zealand 4.4 per cent in
local currency terms, while receding hopes of a reduction cost France a fall
of 1.5 per cent and rising domestic rates left Sweden 2.2 per cent lower.
Hong Kong lost 1.7 per cent on worries about the new airport project
following the stalemate in negotiations between the UK and China.

FT  23 APR 91 / Money Markets: London rates firmer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS OF a sharp rise in March UK retail sales pushed interest rates higher
on the London money market yesterday. Dealers expected a very small increase
of about 0.1 per cent, and were concerned that March sales rose 3.7 per cent
after falling marginally in February.
The authorities said retail demand was boosted by buying ahead of VAT
increases, announced in the Budget on March 19, but not effective until
April 1. Nevertheless the market is concerned that the figure may delay
further cuts in UK bank base rates. Three-month sterling interbank rose to
11 7/8 -11 3/4 from 11 25/32 -11 21/32 per cent and 12-month money firmed to
11 7/16 -11 5/16 from 11 3/8 -11 1/4 per cent.
On Liffe short sterling futures weakened following the retail sales news.
June delivery opened at 88.69 and fell to a low of 88.63 before closing at
88.64 compared with 88.71 previously.
Day-to-day credit was in short supply on the cash market. The Bank of
England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 900m, but revised this to
Pounds 1,100m at noon and to Pounds 1,050m in the afternoon. Total
assistance of Pounds 875m was provided.
An early round of help was offered and at that time the authorities bought
Pounds 161m bills outright, by way of Pounds 23m bank bills in band 1 at 11
7/8 per cent and Pounds 138m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent.
Before lunch another Pounds 153m bills were purchased, via Pounds 45m bank
bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 108m bank bills in band 2 at
11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon Pounds 561m bills were bought, through
Pounds 81m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent, Pounds 42m Treasury
bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent and Pounds 438m bank bills in band 2 at
11 13/16 per cent.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 949m, with exchequer transactions absorbing
Pounds 250m and bank balances below target Pounds 270m. These outweighed a
fall in the note circulation adding Pounds 570m to liquidity.
In Frankfurt call money rose to 8.85 from 8.80 per cent in response to
Friday's warnings by top Bundesbank officials that German monetary policy
will stay tight.
Dealers said they expect call money to remain just below the 9 per cent
Lombard rate, but are waiting for further guidance from the terms of this
week's securities repurchase agreement tender.

FT  23 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Amax optimistic of a bright
outlook for aluminium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM'S OUTLOOK remains exceptionally bright, in spite of the present
very low prices, according to Mr Alan Born, chairman of Amax, the
third-largest US aluminium producer.
He told London analysts and institutional investors that he predicted the
market would be about balanced - as long as there is no sharp deterioration
in economic growth in Europe or Japan. His view contrasts with that of most
analysts who expect a supply surplus this year.
Mr Born admitted that very few of the west's aluminium smelters were
profitable at today's prices. 'But we think the market is at or near the
bottom of the current price cycle,' he said.
Market sentiment had not been helped by the delivery to the west of about
100,000 tonnes of aluminium from the Soviet Union in the past 30 days.
Aluminium for immediate delivery closed at 62.79 cents a lb on the London
Metal Exchange last night. Mr Born suggested 80 to 85 cents a lb was more
likely to be a sustainable price.
The highest-cost smelters were in Europe and cuts would probably come in
this region, he pointed out. Some of the older smelters in North America,
which were benefiting from power contracts related to aluminium prices,
might close as their power contracts came up for renegotiation.
Amax estimated that primary aluminium demand would rise from 14.6m tonnes
this year to 16.2m tonnes in 1995. This forecast indicated that a new
200,000-tonne smelter was required every second year, Mr Born said. But he
added: 'I don't see that happening. Not enough new smelters are being
built.'
The group had enough faith in its forecasts to invest heavily in new primary
aluminium capacity. It had a 25 per cent interest in the recently-completed
expansion of the Becancour smelter in Quebec and was constructing a
USDollars 1bn, wholly-owned smelter at Deschambault, also in Quebec.
Together these projects would add about 50 per cent to Amax's primary
aluminium capacity, taking it to an annual 750,000 tonnes. About 20 per cent
of this would be surplus to Amax's own requirements. More than two-thirds of
Amax's capacity by 1992 would be based on hydro-electric power, up from just
over 49 per cent at present, and would put its costs 'among the lowest of
the low.'
Amax also expected to go ahead with the proposed Dollars 1bn (Pounds 588m)
Antlantal smelter in Iceland in which it would have a 40 per cent interest.
Mr Paul Drack, president of Alumax, the group's aluminium subsidiary, said
negotiations about power contracts for the Iceland project were almost
completed but capital costs needed to be trimmed and government permission
to use foreign workers would be required. He hoped the Iceland smelter could
be operating in 1995.

Brightest and good medium teas showed some irregularity but were mostly
fully firm to dearer. Plainer mediums were barely steady. Coloury Tanzanians
and the better Central Africans attracted increased competition at firm to

convertible

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BAYERISCHE Hypotheken und Wechsel-Bank, the smaller of Bavaria's two leading
banks, is increasing its capital by an issue of DM500m worth of convertible
participating certificates.
The certificates give investors a share of the profits, but do not carry
voting rights. Under German banking law, they count as risk but not core
capital, and under future EC guidelines will be classed as tier two
supplementary capital.
The bank is boosting its capital reserves after a year of rapid credit
expansion in all areas, including in east Germany.
The participating certificates are being offered, at a price yet to be
fixed, to holders of shares and to holders of warrants in the ratio of 39
shares or 39 warrants for one convertible participating certificate with a
face value of DM1,000.
The certificates mature at the end of 2001 and pay a coupon of 9.25 per
cent. Investors have the option to convert one certificate into 3 shares in
the period June to December from 1992 to 1999.
Spain's Banco Hispano Americano and Commerzbank of Germany have agreed to
open a joint offshore banking operation in Gibraltar. The bank, to be called
Hispano Commerzbank, will begin operations with Pta1bn in start-up capital.

NORWAY'S Norske Skog, one of Scandinavia's biggest pulp and paper producers,
plans to issue a convertible bond in the range of NKr550m to NKr700m, with
maturity on December 31, 2000.
The proposal will be made at the company's annual general meeting on May 14.
The bond will be convertible into B shares.
The issue is the last phase of a NKr6bn financing programme which was
initiated in 1990 when a NKr500m convertible bond was launched.
Norske Skog said that the new issue will be aimed at international capital
markets and placed with a selected number of investors.
To retain flexibility in fixing the terms, a framework for the new issue has
been decided. The final proposal will cover the conversion premium, coupon,
subscription period and payment date.
The placement is scheduled for the period between May 6 and May 15, if the
convertible bond is approved at the annual general meeting.
Topdanmark, the Danish banking and insurance group, said its banking unit
Aktivbanken will take over Sydfyns Discontobank as part of its strategy of
building a nationwide financial services network. Sydfyns' end-1990 balance
sheet total was DKr1.1bn.

FT  23 APR 91 / FT Conference (European Securities Markets in the 1990s):
Securities chiefs split as deadline looms - Ahead of next month's Athens
meeting which aims to approve a pan-European stock market trading system,
the views of industry leaders are polarised, reports Richard Waters.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SENIOR officials of the largest stock markets in the European Community
still have markedly different ambitions for a proposed system to support
cross-border share trading, just one month before they are due to reach
agreement on the system's final form.
Speaking in London yesterday at a conference on the development of the
European securities industries, officials from Germany, France and the UK
seemed as far apart as ever on the future for securities trading in Europe.
Yet at a meeting in Athens in a month's time, they and other EC exchanges
hope to agree the development of Euroquote, a network which could form the
basis for cross-border share trading.
Mr Rudiger von Rosen, executive vice-chairman of the Federation of German
Stock Exchanges, said that there is no demand in Germany for Euroquote to
act as a pure information system - the planned first phase of the
development. Instead, he said, 'the obvious need remains for a European
settlement system'.
Mr Jean-Francois Theodore, chairman and chief executive of the Paris Bourse,
did not specifically address the question of Euroquote in his speech, but
later said that the system was not a necessary part of cross-border share
trading. Commercial information suppliers could disseminate information just
as effectively, he said.
Mr Peter Rawlins, chief executive of London's International Stock Exchange,
said that to be useful, Euroquote should carry regulated company news -
something that only two of the 12 EC exchanges could currently provide about
companies they listed. He added: 'We are sceptical about the development of
Euroquote into any (as yet wholly undefined) kind of trading or settlement
system . . . We must first decide what it is that Europe's markets need.'
Mr Patrick Gifford, a director of Fleming Investment Management, challenged
many of the assumptions made by the exchanges when he said that, for an
investor, the current fragmented European markets offered greater
opportunities than would exist in a single, efficient, transparent market.
Instead, he called for cheaper settlement costs and changes that would make
the job of fund managers easier. These include a common settlement period in
all markets, to make international switching easier, and more information
from exchanges about corporate actions like the timing of dividend payments.
Differences also arose over the regulation of cross-border share trading.
The EC hopes by June to agree an Investment Services Directive to regulate
securities business, but this has so far foundered on strong differences of
principle.
Mr Theodore said that cross-border share trading would develop through
co-operation between existing national markets, each of which would remain
the main centre of liquidity in its own domestic shares. What was needed was
high standards of transparency and listing requirements on each market.
He defended the view that this should be extended to all equity markets,
including wholesale markets developed for professional investors, such as
SEAQ International in London. 'Investors need some sort of price
transparency, whatever the market they are dealing on,' he said.
Mr Rawlins, though, argued against imposing a common level of price
transparency, adding that such ideas 'could drive business away from
regulated markets or, indeed, drive it away from Europe altogether.'
Mr Geoffrey Fitchew, director general of the EC directorate for financial
institutions and company law, laid out the terms of the EC's planned
compromise. He said that investors should be able to give a blanket
authorisation to intermediaries to deal off-exchange on their behalf, and
that it should be left to member states to decide whether and when the
details of transactions are published, provided they are all reported to a
market authority.
Mr Jeffrey Knight, conference chairman and a special adviser to the
Federation of Stock Exchanges in the EC, said Europe's various securities
markets would inevitably grow closer.
'The question is not whether markets will become integrated, but how,' he
said.

FT  23 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Brazil warms to overseas
mediums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN-issued medium-term notes have become one of the hottest corporate
finance tools in Brazil this year, as tight credit and high inflation at
home force companies to look abroad for funds.
Brazilian companies have so far issued Dollars 620m of medium-term notes
overseas in 1991.
The product is officially known as 'commercial paper'. But because it must
be placed at maturities of at least two years, bears more resemblance to
medium-term notes.
Brazilian banks have been quick to take advantage of the change in rules.
Banco Frances e Brasileiro (BFB), an associate of Credit Lyonnais, has
issued Dollars 100m during the past few months, and is currently negotiating
another Dollars 100m issue. Credibanco has made a Dollars 100m placement and
Banco Real Dollars 20m.
'The product has given us an important new option in obtaining medium-term
financing,' said Mr Ruy Raya, head of commercial-paper issues at BFB.
'Inflation is still so high here that it is extremely difficult to obtain
funds with maturation more than a few months out.'
One of the main attractions of medium-term notes is their tax-exempt status.
This allows multi-national companies to use the product to replace
inter-company loans, which are fully taxed.
The success of this product contrasts sharply with domestic commercial paper
issues which have failed to catch investors' imaginations. Since the product
came on the market in November last year, not a single issue has been made.
According to a spokesman for the Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios (CVM),
Brazil's stock market watchdog, this is because a flat tax of 0.64 per cent
of the total value of the issue has proved prohibitively expensive.
The issuing group must be registered with the CVM, itself a costly process.
Domestically issued commercial paper also carries a maximum maturity of six
months, a term unappealing to companies in dire need of longer-term funds.

FT  23 APR 91 / International Capital Markets (International Bonds): Spain
issue could spark Ecu primary sector revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ecu bond market, which has been subdued for the last month or so, looks
set to revive, as the Kingdom of Spain prepares an Ecu750m-Ecu1bn issue of
registered bonds. However, dealers say there is an overhang of paper from
the deluge of issues earlier in the year.
Banesto will lead manage the issue, which may emerge later this week.
Spain's debut in the Ecu market a year ago, an Ecu500m offering due 1995,
has performed strongly and is yielding 9.08 per cent, a relatively expensive
level compared with other secondary market issues.
An intensive marketing campaign in Spain will seek to encourage domestic
participation, which ran at around 5 per cent for the last issue. On the
face of it, Spanish investors have little incentive to buy Ecu bonds
yielding 9 per cent or so, when Spanish government bonds denominated in
pesetas yield more than 12 per cent and carry no foreign exchange risk.
However, the peseta is expected to weaken against the Ecu over the medium-
to long-term, so domestic investors' returns may be enhanced by currency
gains.
In addition, Banesto will again be offering Ecu bank accounts to retail
investors.
Nevertheless, despite its domestic, registered structure, the deal will be
mainly placed internationally, and will trade like a Eurobond. The issue,
which will not be swapped, is expected to be attractively priced, given its
political purpose.
The maturity and size of the issue could be fixed later today, once the
extent of institutional interest in the French Treasury's offer to exchange
an outstanding six-year Ecu bond issue for longer-dated bonds has been
gauged.
In the Australian dollar market, the State Electricity Commission of
Victoria launched an ADollars 100m 10-year deal. The borrower's outstanding
debt is currently under review by Moody's for possible downgrade from
Double-A1. However, the pricing took account of any uncertainty, dealers
said. They added that investors know Australian states (the borrower is
guaranteed by the State of Victoria) are declining credits. In the
equity-linked sector, Unitika, a Japanese textile manufacturer, launched a
Dollars 110m four-year deal, quoted at a premium of three points to its par
issue price.

FT  23 APR 91 / Brazilian steel group plunges into red

<TEXT>
USIMINAS, the steel group due to be one of the first companies to be
privatised in Brazil this year, announced an inflation-adjusted net loss for
last year of NCrz1.5bn, or about Dollars 5.3m at today's unofficial rates.
In 1989, the group registered an inflation-adjusted net profit of NCrz36bn.
Using another accounting method, the group claimed a net profit of
NCrz1.9bn, a result which led Usiminas to claim it was the only steel group
in Brazil last year to record a positive result.
The group blamed recession at home and an overvalued cruzeiro for the feeble
figures. Demand for steel dropped 30 per cent in Brazil last year, dipping
to its lowest level in 13 years. These factors, however, did not exact a
heavy toll on gross receipts, which rose in real terms from NCrz129bn in
1989 to NCrz139bn last year.
A bigger problem seemed to be mounting expenditures on debt service. In
1989, Usiminas earned large amounts of interest on its resources but in
1990, the situation had turned around, and led the group to declare a loss
on operations of NCrz2.1bn.
This loss was despite what the group referred to as a 'rigorous programme to
reduce costs'.

FT  23 APR 91 / Venezuela may sell 35% of airline overseas

VENEZUELA, in announcing the conditions under which it will privatise its
Viasa international airline, says foreign airlines will be able to buy
around 35 per cent of the airline's shares.
The government stipulates that although it plans to sell up to 60 per cent
of Viasa, it will keep at least 51 per cent in the Venezuelan hands. It also
says airline employees can own up to 20 per cent of Viasa under stock
purchase plans.
Viasa, which flies to Europe, the US, Latin America and the Caribbean, made
a loss last year. Profits in previous years were due mainly to government
export bonuses.
Viasa operates five DC-10 jets (four are owned by the airline, one is
leased) and three leased Airbus 300-B4s.
Officials say they plan to complete the privatisation of Viasa by July of
this year. Potential bidders must set up consortia that will be able to
operate the airline, the government said.
Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) plans capital investments of Dollars 48bn for
domestic and international projects by 1996, including direct capital
outlays of Dollars 34bn by PDVSA itself.
In addition, Dollars 14bn is to be invested by overseas subsidiaries,
partners in existing joint ventures and private companies which are
developing new projects with PDVSA.
PDVSA is one of the world's largest petroleum companies and has oil refining
and distribution assets in the US, Germany, Sweden and Belgium. The Dollars
34bn in direct investments programmed by PDVSA represents an increase of 36
per cent - or Dollars 9bn - over the Dollars 25bn investment programme for
1991-96 announced at the end of last year.
In 1990, PDVSA's total turnover topped Dollars 23bn. The company has over
60bn barrels in proven reserves of crude oil, the largest in the western
hemisphere.

VME Group, the construction equipment group owned jointly by Volvo of Sweden
and Clark Equipment of the US, plans to invest SKr135m (Dollars 21.8m) in
its articulated dumptruck business, including SKr80m for a new factory in
Sweden.
The investment is one of the very few so far this year in the construction
equipment industry, which has been hit by recession in the US and UK. In
February VME announced a 10 per cent rise in 1990 operating profits to
Dollars 79m, against the industry trend and helped by a strong performance
in continental Europe.
VME is the world's largest producer of articulated dumptrucks and will be
investing the money in its Swedish-based subsidiary VME Articulated Haulers.
Manufacturing will be moved to a new plant near the existing one at Braas,
Sweden. VME plans to modernise the dumptruck frames and bodies and
reorganise the workforce. Production at the new plant will begin in autumn,
1992.
VME also plans to concentrate production of rigid dumptrucks at its plant in
Guelph, Canada. Production at the group's rigid hauler operations in
Landskrona, Sweden, will cease at the end of 1992.

<TEXT>
CUMMINS Engine, one of the world's leading diesel engine makers, suffered a
first-quarter operating loss and warned of a further decline in the North
American heavy truck market.
Cummins' bottom line was bolstered by various accounting changes, which
resulted in net earnings of Dollars 17.2m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, compared
with Dollars 8.9m, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier.
But sales slipped to Dollars 811.5m from Dollars 861.4m, and there was a
loss before the accounting changes of Dollars 34.3m. A new inventory
accounting method and an adjustment to the method of depreciating engine
production equipment produced a one-time gain of Dollars 26.5m.
The company expects to decide within the next month whether to cut its
dividend from the present annual rate of Dollars 2.20 a share.
This month Cummins said its second-quarter operating loss would be cut
substantially provided production volumes hold, but it warned yesterday that
a further drop in the truck market is expected over the next few months.
North American heavy-truck output has sunk by 45 per cent since the first
quarter of 1989 and by 14 per cent since last summer.
Cummins said the UK truck market and worldwide orders for off-highway
vehicles have also weakened 'significantly'.
The company has laid off another 170 workers at its US heavy-truck engine
plants this month, bringing the cuts to 3,800 people, or 14 per cent of the
worldwide workforce, in the past months.

FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: San Miguel debt plan overturned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PLAN by San Miguel, the Philippine brewing conglomerate, to issue
convertible debt has been voted down by shareholders after the company's
former chairman had argued that the issue would prejudice his interests.
The vote at the San Miguel annual meeting on Friday represents another
winning round by former chairman, Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, in the fight to
reassume a substantial role in the management of San Miguel.
At stake, according to Mr Cojuangco's lawyer, was ultimate control of San
Miguel, the Philippines' biggest industrial company.
Under the management's debt plan, shares in San Miguel nominally owned by Mr
Cojuangco, but held in trust by the government, would not have qualified for
the convertible issue.
Mr Cojuangco's 18 per cent equity stake in San Miguel was taken into
guardianship by the Good Government Commission in 1986 because of
allegations that the shares were acquired illegally.
The shares remain in dispute and were thus unavailable for Friday's
shareholder vote. Since the plan involved the eventual issue of 7.5 per cent
of San Miguel's outstanding shares, it threatened to dilute seriously Mr
Cojuangco's potential shareholding.
Mr Andres Soriano, the chairman of San Miguel, said the company's management
believed the 3bn pesos (Dollars 110m) convertible debt issue was 'in the
best interests of the company', and that its rejection 'could hurt some of
our plans'.
The issue, together with 2bn pesos from internally generated sources, was
earmarked for an expansion and modernisation programme.
The Good Government Commission holds stakes in 300 Philippine companies
pending a determination of whether they represent unlawful proceeds.
Mr Estelito Mendoza, Mr Cojuangco's lawyer, said the decision was likely to
have a knock-on effect for another Cojuangco case pending before the Supreme
Court.
This relates to shares seized by the commission in the United Coconut
Planters Bank, which, if freed, would unlock the bank's indirectly-owned 30
per cent stake in San Miguel.
Along with the 18 per cent stake and residual proxies, this would give Mr
Cojuangco effective control of San Miguel together with eight of the 15
seats on its board of directors.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KAO, the Japanese toiletries maker, last year suffered losses in its
overseas operations which virtually wiped out the increase in profits made
inside Japan.
The group yesterday posted a rise in consolidated pre-tax profits for the
year to March of just 0.4 per cent to Y38bn (Dollars 274m), compared with an
increase of 3.4 per cent to Y40.1bn at the parent company. The parent
company accounts for the bulk of Kao's operations within Japan. Six
subsidiaries, including the US business, made losses.
The parent company saw sales rise 4.5 per cent to Y570bn. Growth was held
back by intense competition in the market for household detergents, where
Kao's highly-successful Attack has spawned imitators. Also, Kao made little
new headway in hygiene products, including disposable nappies, where it
launched New Merries. On a consolidated basis, sales were up 6.7 per cent at
Y662bn.
For the current year, Kao forecasts parent company sales of Y585bn, an
increase of 2.6 per cent, and pre-tax profits of Y42bn, up 3.4 per cent. Kao
said it hoped for increases in sales and profits despite a slow-down in the
Japanese economy. It said that because the domestic market for household
products was mature it was pouring its energies into developing new markets.

ABITIBI-PRICE, one of Canada's three biggest integrated pulp and paper
groups, yesterday revealed that it had posted a small loss in the first
quarter.
It also warned it expected a difficult year because of poor markets,
especially in newsprint.
Sales in the period dipped 7.5 per cent to CDollars 726m (USDollars 625m)
and the first-quarter loss was CDollars 5.5m or 9 cents a share, against a
loss of CDollars 11.3m or 17 cents a year earlier, including a CDollars
13.7m special charge.
During the quarter, Abitibi, controlled by the Reichmann brothers of
Toronto, made two disposals for CDollars 53m.
More non-core assets will be sold to reduce debt.
Even the paper distribution and converting businesses, though profitable,
will be adversely affected by the recession throughout 1991.
In the first quarter Abitibi lost money on an operating basis in all its
activities, except distribution and converted products.
Newsprint production was 444,000 tonnes and groundwood papers were 105,000
tonnes, both around the same level as a year earlier.
Campeau Corp has sold a 10 year old office building in Montreal to
Confederation Life Insurance, raising the total generated by property sales
in eastern Canada to about CDollars 500m in the past year.

<TEXT>
NOVA, a large Canadian energy, pipeline and petrochemicals group, is
considering splitting its business into two separate companies, with
shareholders maintaining their proportionate interests.
Nova is the main natural gas pipeline operator in Alberta, a
provincially-regulated business and hiving off this activity would ease the
task of raising new capital.
The other entity would hold the oil and gas and petrochemical interests and
raise capital on its own.
Petrochemicals and plastics are subject to big price swings. At present the
gas transmission business accounts for more than half Nova's total business.
In 1988 Nova bought Polysar's petrochemical business for well over CDollars
2bn (USDollars 1.7bn) and last year sold the synthetic rubber division for
CDollars 1.35bn. Its 43 per cent interest in Husky Oil would be rolled into
the new energy and petrochemicals company.
RBC Dominion Securities and Morgan Stanley of New York are advising Nova on
the restructuring.

examined by Canada

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Canadian government's Bureau of Competition Policy has begun a formal
inquiry into the proposed acquisition of Square D of the US by France's
Groupe Schneider.
Both companies, which produce electrical equipment, have significant
competing businesses in Canada.
Under Canadian law, an inquiry begins only if there are reasonable grounds
to believe an acquisition could substantially prevent or lessen competition
in Canada.
Square D has been fighting off Schneider efforts to take it over since
February, when Schneider made an unsolicited offer of USDollars 78 per
share, or Dollars 1.9bn, for the company. Square D wants to remain
independent and is looking for third parties with which to make alliances.
Mr Jerre Stead, chairman of Square D, said Schneider's takeover effort
'raises substantial questions under the Canadian competition laws as well as
under the US anti-trust laws and competition laws of several European
countries'.
A US District Court is scheduled to consider Square D's allegations that the
Schneider acquisition would violate US anti-trust laws on May 13.
Square D is also urging the US Federal Reserve to review the Schneider
takeover bid on the grounds that it would violate US banking laws. American
bank holding companies are prohibited from owning more than 5 per cent of a
non-banking company.
At issue, according to Square D, is the control of Schneider by Paribas and
Societe Generale, the big French retail bank, which hold 9.7 per cent and 10
per cent, respectively, of the shares of SPEP, which in turn holds a
majority interest in Schneider.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNUSUALLY high refining margins in Europe and the Pacific Rim helped boost
Mobil Corp's first-quarter earnings by 78 per cent.
North America's second biggest integrated oil company lifted net earnings to
Dollars 710m, or Dollars 1.73 a share, from Dollars 400m, or 94 cents a
share, a year earlier.
The 1990 figure included a Dollars 28m tax charge from a prior period. Sales
climbed by 10 per cent to Dollars 16.6bn.
The improved earnings were due largely to the strong performance of several
international businesses. Income from marketing and refining soared
four-fold to Dollars 442m, with non-US operations contributing Dollars 342m,
compared with Dollars 81m a year earlier.
Mobil ascribed the wide international refining margins to a shortage of
capacity. Earnings were especially strong in Singapore and in Australia,
where Mobil has acquired Exxon's refining and marketing operations.
Natural gas output outside the US rose to record levels, due partly to the
cold winter in Europe. On the other hand, North American exploration and
production earnings were hit by the unremitting fall in natural gas prices
caused by warm weather, weak demand and competition from alternative liquid
fuels.
Crude oil prices were about level with a year ago, but some Dollars 10 a
barrel below the fourth-quarter average.
Mr Allen Murray, the chairman, said that although refining margins have
recently narrowed from the peaks earlier this year, 'they should continue to
support good earnings, although below first-quarter levels'. He noted,
however, that earnings from petrochemicals have recently come under
pressure.

THE IMPACT of recession on advertising demand and the cost of covering the
Gulf war has cut into the profitability of Capital Cities/ABC, one of the
three biggest US television networks.
It yesterday unveiled a 38 per cent slump in first-quarter operating income
to Dollars 120.2m and warned of a possible further decline in second-quarter
earnings.
The company owns the ABC radio and television national networks, local
television and radio stations and weekly newspapers, including the Fairchild
fashion trade publications.
It said first-quarter net income plunged about 45 per cent to Dollars 58.6m
or Dollars 3.50 a share from Dollars 106.3m or Dollars 6.08 a year earlier
on revenues which were essentially unchanged at Dollars 1.26bn.
Operating income in the first three months of 1991 was Dollars 130.3m,
against Dollars 211.5m a year ago, while income before taxes dropped 44 per
cent to Dollars 103.4m from Dollars 186.2m.
Capital Cities/ABC's weak first-quarter performance comes on the heels of
poor results from CBS and General Electric's NBC broadcasting business,
which were also hurt by higher news costs and the very weak advertising
market.
Capital Cities/ABC said yesterday there had been a return to more normal
business patterns since the end of the Gulf war.
However, the company said levels of advertising demand might not be
sufficient to prevent earnings from declining in the second quarter of this
year.
Capital Cities/ABC said the operating profits from its television network in
the first quarter of 1991 represented a significant decline from the
previous year's results.
In the three months ended March 31, revenues from the company's broadcasting
operating advanced to Dollars 1bn from Dollars 992.5m, thanks to gains from
the telecast of the Super Bowl and two National Football League (NFL) Wild
Card playoff games.
Capital Cities/ABC's publishing operations brought in revenues of Dollars
250.6m in the latest quarter, down about 7 per cent from the previous year.
Operating income from publishing dropped 24 per cent to Dollars 18.4m from
Dollars 24.3m, with declines in all operating groups.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISTITUTO Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the big Turin-based bank, is
negotiating to buy Banco Catala de Credit, a
medium-sized Spanish bank owned by Banco Banesto.
The purchase would substantially boost San Paolo's expansion plans in Spain,
where it bought a 35 per cent stake in Banca Matutes, a small 32-branch
private bank, last year.
Banco Catala de Credit has 105 branches, 26 of which are around its
Barcelona base, and the remainder in Catalonia. It had net profits of
L12.3bn (Dollars 9.59m) last year. Banca Matutes is concentrated on the
Balearic Islands. San Paolo itself last year opened a Madrid branch.
San Paolo could not comment on the likely price for the acquisition, but
confirmed talks were under way on a letter of intent.
Separately, the company denied recent Italian press reports that San Paolo
had substantially raised its stake in Hambros, the UK merchant bank,
following the sale by Baltica, the Danish insurance group, of a 14 per cent
stake.
San Paolo's holding has recently risen to about 14.9 per cent from 14.3 per
cent, but this was due to the exercise of convertible bond holdings.
Sasib, the quoted food, packaging and industrial group controlled by Mr
Carlo De Benedetti's CIR holding company, raised net profits by 16.6 per
cent to L70.2bn from L60.2bn last year.
Total sales jumped by 22 per cent to L619.7bn, with foreign turnover,
boosted by acquisitions, surging by 50 per cent to L439.2bn. The company is
paying a dividend of L230 for ordinary shares and L250 for its savings
shares respectively.

Banesto slips back

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO SANTANDER, the Spanish commercial bank which owns 10 per cent of Royal
Bank of Scotland and which recently bought 13.3 per cent of First Fidelity
Bank in the US, said yesterday its first-quarter net consolidated profits
increased 21 per cent to Pta20bn (Dollars 187m).
Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), one of Santander's main Spanish rivals,
reported a 17.15 per cent drop in net first-quarter profits for its
financial group (which excludes its industrial corporation) to Pta12.99bn,
largely because of a sharp fall in extraordinary profits.
Santander, which recently sold control of Electra de Viesgo, a northern
electricity utility, for Pta40.5bn, giving it a net profit on the deal of
Pta14.8bn, said its cash flow in the first three months of 1991 had
increased 65.46 per cent to Pta54.4bn, almost half of which had been made
over to provisions and reserves.
Santander said shareholders would receive its second 1990 dividend payment -
Pta100 - on April 30, making the total payout for the year 16.22 per cent
higher than in 1989.
Banesto's lower results were due to sharply reduced extraordinary income
which usually involves disposal of assets. Banesto's financial group made
Pta2.9bn from such sales in the first three-quarters of this year against
Pta8bn last year.
Gross operating profits for the financial group rose, in contrast, by 12.5
per cent to Pta19.3bn due to a 9.8 per cent rise in the financial margin to
Pta42.9bn and to strongly increased income from commissions which were up by
51 per cent to Pta11.6bn. Operating costs were up by 19.5 per cent to
Pta35.3bn.
Total consolidated assets of the financial group, which exclude those of
Banesto's industrial conglomerate, increased by 26.4 per cent to Pta5,399bn
in the first quarter.
A notable feature of this figure was a 29.7 per cent rise in loans to
Pta2,606bn. In the first three months of 1990, loans to the private sector
were limited to a 10 per cent increase under the government's credit
restriction policy.
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Spain's largest bank, said yesterday it had bought a
further 6 per cent of the large Catalan water utility, Aguas de Barcelona,
to take its stake in the group to 14.5 per cent.
The bank bought the extra stake from the Catalan gas utility, Catalana de
Gas. Its efforts to form a giant Catalan energy and resources group were
frustrated last year when Repsol, the state-owned oil conglomerate, and La
Caixa, the Barcelona savings bank, combined to take control of Catalana de
Gas and merge it into Repsol's growing gas interests.
The government, however, has been keen to prevent Aguas de Barcelona falling
into French hands and will have actively supported BBV increasing its stake.

<TEXT>
DAIMLER-BENZ, the diversified German motor group, said its pre-tax profits
fell by around 10 per cent last year, much of the decline caused by currency
movements.
Because of a lower tax payment, however, net profits were 6 per cent higher
at DM1.8bn (Dollars 1.03bn) compared with the comparable figure of DM1.7bn.
It actually announced a net profit of DM6.8bn for 1989, but DM5.1bn of this
was due to a change in accounting methods. Daimler gave no pre-tax figure
for last year. Turnover rose by 5 per cent to DM85.5bn.
It said it would maintain its dividend at DM12 a share. Mr Edzard Reuter,
the chief executive, said in February that Daimler had considered raising
its dividend until it became clear last autumn that the dollar's weakness -
which especially affects Mercedes-Benz car sales in the US - and worsening
economic conditions would hold back profits.
Last week, AEG, its electrical and electronics subsidiary, announced a
DM205m loss for 1990; Daimler said a further loss was expected this year as
a result of restructuring measures.

FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Nixdorf holds back Siemens
result

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIEMENS made a first-half loss of DM380m (Dollars 227m) on its computer
activities in the first half of the financial year to September 30, 1991, as
it began to integrate the business of Nixdorf, the company which it rescued
last year.
The continuation of Nixdorf's losses added to the burdens on the German
electrical and electronics group at a time when worldwide economic
conditions have deteriorated.
Its total first-half net profits rose by 6 per cent to DM793m. Siemens did
not spell out the extent to which the Nixdorf loss held back its full
result; analysts, who pointed out that German companies have considerable
accounting leeway in arranging how they report their results, have already
forecast lower group earnings per share this year.
The group said the loss made by Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme, created
by the merger of its computer interests with Nixdorf, partly reflected a
backlog of DM500m in unbilled sales. This was caused by the time taken to
integrate the two companies.
New computer orders in the first half totalled DM5.7bn, a fall of 5 per
cent, with invoiced sales 17 per cent lower at DM5.1bn; allowing for the
backlog, however, sales were less than 10 per cent lower.
Siemens said the integration of Nixdorf was going well, but was not
completed.
Strong gains in orders and sales were recorded in the second quarter.
Siemens Nixdorf said recently it might not show a profit for the whole of
1990-91. Nixdorf made a DM800m loss in the last nine months before its full
absorption by Siemens in last October; DM300m of this was to meet
restructuring costs and valuation changes.
The group has already warned that growth in total profits would be difficult
this year.
In the last financial year, net income rose by 6 per cent to DM1.7bn and
Siemens raised its dividend.
Outlining overall group progress in the first half, Siemens said it booked a
15 per cent rise in new orders to DM41.4bn, though half the improvement
stemmed from the first-time inclusion of new businesses.
Domestic orders showed a 30 per cent advance, with business in east Germany,
much of it linked to vital infrastructure improvements, totalling DM1.4bn.
The group said foreign business stagnated. The 6 per cent rise in foreign
orders to DM23bn was mainly due to the inclusion of the merged Siemens
Nixdorf operation and the activities acquired from Plessey of the UK.
Turnover during the period totalled DM33.1bn, a rise of 9 per cent; of this,
7 percentage points were due to the enlargement of the group.

SHIZUSHIN Lease, a Japanese financial company with debts of Y255.5bn
(Dollars 186m), filed for court protection from its creditors yesterday in a
further sign of the pressures imposed by high interest rates and weak
property markets.
Shizushin, a medium-sized leasing company, will go bankrupt if its creditors
fail to agree on a reorganisation plan.
If it goes under, it will be the fourth-largest corporate failure in Japan
and the second-biggest this year after Nanatomi, a property developer, which
went bankrupt owing Y300bn.
Shizushin would be the first financial company to fail during the squeeze on
credit in Japan. It was founded in 1982 and began by financing the lease of
office equipment. It subsequently expanded into property lending.
Its borrowers include a company run by Mr Suemitsu Ito, a property developer
connected with Itoman, the trading company which got into financial
difficulties through investment in land. Mr Ito worked for Itoman for eight
months until he resigned late last year. During that time, he was
responsible for expanding its property investments.
Shizushin, based in Shizuoka, a town west of Tokyo, was established with the
help of the Shizuoka Shinkin Bank, a local institution.
Shizuoka Shinkin has a 4.7 per cent stake in Shizushin, but it is not
thought to be threatened by the leasing company's difficulties.

<TEXT>
NORWAY'S Vard shipping group said yesterday that in the first quarter of
this year it had plunged into a pre-tax deficit of NKr37.3m (Dollars 5.53m),
compared with profits of NKr104.4m in the same period of 1990.
Vard said that the poor result was due mainly to a large number of
cancellations by customers for Kloster Cruise, the group's cruise unit,
during the Gulf war.
Kloster Cruise reversed its 1990 first-quarter NKr67.5m profit into a
NKr25.9m loss for the first quarter of this year. The figure includes a
currency exchange gain of NKr84.1m.
The group warned that Kloster Cruise's bookings in the second quarter will
also be affected by a general decline in the cruise market but suggested
that results would improve.
Vard said that the capacity in Royal Viking Line, another cruise operation,
is to be reduced by 70 per cent in 1992.

stake
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TEXAS CORPORATE raider Mr T. Boone Pickens is considering selling his 26.4
per cent stake in Koito Manufacturing, the Japanese motor parts manufacturer
which has repeatedly spurned his advances.
A spokesman for Mr Pickens yesterday told the Associated Press news agency
that the disposal of the Koito shares, currently worth about Dollars 850m,
is among several options being considered by the Dallas-based financier.
'We're not in any rush, but it's one of the things we're looking at,' the
spokesman said.
However, he denied Japanese reports that Mr Pickens has already sold his
shares back to Mr Kitaro Watanabe, the Japanese speculator who secretly
financed the purchases with a loan secured by the shares.
A Koito spokesman said in New York yesterday that the Japanese company had
no 'direct information' on the reports of Mr Pickens' retreat, but that 'we
would certainly not be surprised by such a turn of events'.
Mr Pickens has had several well-publicised run-ins with Koito, which has
refused to give him any representation on its board and has consistently
accused him of being a front for Mr Watanabe's efforts at short-term
speculation.
The market price of Koito shares has halved since Mr Pickens made his
initial investment two years ago through his privately-held holding company
Boone Co.
Besides Koito's unremitting hostility, Mr Pickens' willingness to put his
shares up for sale may be influenced by the financial difficulties of Mesa
Limited Partnership, the large US natural gas producer of which Mr Pickens
is the general partner and in which he has a 4.5 per cent stake.
One New York analyst also suggested yesterday that Mr Pickens may see his
continued involvement with Koito as a hurdle to his apparent ambitions to
run for election as governor of Texas.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: How Group declines 19% and warns of bigger
fall this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW GROUP, the Midlands-based building services contractor, warned that
profits were likely to be much lower this year as the trading environment
remained difficult.
Mr Peter How, chairman, said: 'In a recession the bigger companies and the
smaller companies come out better and it's the people in the middle who get
squeezed. But we're not ultra dispirited.'
The group made its forecast as it reported a 19 per cent decline, from
Pounds 5.18m to Pounds 4.21m, in pre-tax profits for 1990.
However, the 1989 figure included Pounds 1.15m from investment disposals.
A fall in margins had put pressure on profitability, Mr How said. Margins
were down about 1 per cent on order book values.
Turnover rose 6 per cent to Pounds 236.58m (Pounds 222.83m) while orders
overall had fallen about 15 per cent.
The group was particularly hurt by a 20 per cent fall in the engineering
division's order books since that accounted for a large proportion of its
businesses. Costs associated with delayed orders were a main factor, Mr How
said.
On the other hand, the distribution division, which supplies refrigeration
and air conditioning machinery, saw its order book climb, helped by the fact
that its business was outside the construction industry.
Steps had been taken to try to maintain profit margins, tighten credit
controls and cut costs through staff reductions.
Recent bids were on very slim profit margins so that the group has had to be
extremely selective in what it tendered for, Mr How said. It still had a net
cash position.
Earnings per share were 5.94p (8.32p) and an unchanged final dividend of
2.25p is recommended, holding the total at 3.6p.
In order to bring more accountability to the organisation, the
decision-making and managerial functions have been split.
A main board will be responsible for planning and monitoring performance,
and a group executive board will be responsible for implementing policies
and overseeing the management of divisions.
Mr David Summerfield has taken over as chief executive from Mr Arthur
Hogarth, who is retiring as managing director.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Ramco rises to Pounds 1.1m and seals Soviet
joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAMCO OIL Services, which provides tubes to the North Sea oil industry,
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.13m for 1990, compared with Pounds
942,000 previously.
The heavy burden of maintenance currently underway in the North Sea, which
requires the shutdown of installations, kept turnover static at Pounds
4.78m, but Ramco is paying an annual dividend of 2p - its first for five
years. Earnings rose 0.1p to 3.96p.
Mr Stephen Remp, chairman, said he was looking for a boost to turnover next
year when extensive North Sea maintenance work would be complete.
At the beginning of this year, Ramco set up a joint-venture operation to
import oil pumps from the Soviet Union in a bid to capture 10 per cent of
the Dollars 500m (Pounds 292m) western market for electric submersible
pumps.
Alnas, the Soviet company which makes the pumps, has taken a 50 per cent
stake in the Aberdeen-based venture to market the pumps in the west and two
Soviet directors sit on its board.
The first shipment of pumps is due to arrive in June.
In an effort to break into the market, Mr Remp said the company would try to
get round any reluctance it encounters among western firms by offering
generous guarantees to replace any pump which fails in its first year of
operation.
Alnas started making the electric pumps 12 years ago in a bid to reduce the
dependence of the Soviet oil industry on imported equipment. Its
manufacturing facilities were set up using western technology to make a
Soviet-designed pump.
Mr Remp said the high quality of the pumps meant that they could last up to
800 days while western pumps will last 200-600 days. Nevertheless, he said
he thought the venture would have to offer some price advantages to make
them attractive to western buyers.
Flexible arrangements would also be offered on hire or hire-purchase and
giving companies the chance to have the pumps on a trial basis. Alnas is
carrying the cost of holding stock by supplying pumps and taking the payment
when they are sold.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Polymark prospects justify 1p dividend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POLYMARK International, the industrial laundry equipment and technographics
group, is returning to the dividend list after an absence of 10 years as
'medium-term prospects are sufficiently encouraging'.
Fully diluted earnings per share benefited from a low tax charge and moved
ahead to 5.07p in 1990, against 4.49p. The proposed dividend is 1p.
Pre-tax profit, however, fell from Pounds 2.01m to Pounds 1.51m in the year.
That reflected a substantial reduction in operating income from discontinued
activities of Pounds 421,000 (Pounds 2.51m), which was offset somewhat by an
improvement in continuing operations from Pounds 237,000 to Pounds 594,000
and interest credit of Pounds 442,000 (charge of Pounds 785,000).
Mr Len Weaver, chairman, said the laundry division held its profit at Pounds
352,000 after reorganisation costs of Pounds 42,000. In technographics, a
programme to improve productivity and enhance margins led to a turnround
from a loss of Pounds 114,000 to a profit of Pounds 242,000.
He said much was done to create a more stable and profitable basis for the
continuing operations.
Below the line there was an extraordinary profit of Pounds 2.92m, being the
final dividend from Polymark France and surplus on the sale of the French
division.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: New EFM trust comes to market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK market's current enthusiasm for split capital investment trusts
continues with the Pounds 15m flotation of EFM Income Trust.
There are two classes of shares in the trust, managed by Edinburgh Fund
Managers. Zero dividend preference shares, with a par value of 25p, are
being issued at 35p each. The trust will repay zero holders at 95p per share
in the year 2000, a compound growth rate of 11.75 per cent.
Although repayment at that level is not guaranteed, the trust will be able
to do so, provided net asset value does not fall between now and 2000.
The ordinary shares, issued at 65p apiece, will be entitled to all the
income. EFM expects the yield on the shares to be above that on the FT-A
All-Share Index. Net assets of the trust will need to grow at 6 per cent per
annum compound for the shares to be repaid at the issue price in 2000.
The trust will invest in the UK, with about 80 per cent in equities and the
rest in convertibles, bonds and cash.
Allied Provincial Securities is underwriting and sponsoring the issue, which
consists of a placing of 15m of each class of share. Dealings are expected
to start on April 29.

BURNFIELD, a manufacturer of electric surface heating systems, returned
profits of Pounds 1.41m pre-tax and exceptional items for the 11 months to
end-December.
For the previous 12 months the group, which has been restructured and now
operates under a new management team, achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.06m.
Turnover for the period under review totalled Pounds 15.31m (Pounds 17.03m).
Exceptional items accounted for Pounds 701,000 (nil) and tax for Pounds
542,000 (Pounds 868,000). Extraordinary provisions of Pounds 3.06m reflected
reorganisation costs and a deferred tax write-off.
Excluding exceptional items, earnings per share emerged at 7.5p (10.8p)
basic or at 7p (9.5p) fully diluted.
An unchanged final dividend of 3.85p makes a same-again 5.5p total.

the production and development group, made Pounds 608,624 in 1990, compared
with Pounds 720,673 in the 18 months to December 31 1989.
Kingston's directors maintained that the conversion from dollars to pounds

Turnover rose to Pounds 3.43m (Pounds 2.84m for 18 months), but operating
profits were down at Pounds 583,702 (Pounds 699,286). Earnings worked
through at 4.86p per share, against 7.07p, and the final dividend is a
proposed 1p, to make 1.56p for the year. The total pay-out in the 18-month
period was 1.66p.
Last August Kingston bought Orcol Fuels, a waste oil reclamation business,
for Pounds 4.5m, providing the company with its first UK earnings base.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: BP nightmare haunts sale of stake in BT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS MINISTERS finalise their proposals for the sale of part of the
government's 48.6 per cent stake in British Telecom, the 1987 flotation of
British Petroleum is weighing heavily on their minds.
BP was the last major secondary sale, valued at Pounds 7.5bn, including a
Pounds 1.5bn rights issue, and proved something of a nightmare. Although
considered a one-off because of the collapse in the stock market government
officials believe there is much to be learnt from the issue.
The shares were originally offered at a 20p discount to the 350p market
price. But when the world's markets crashed in late October potential
investors were looking at a 70p loss.
No-one is expecting a collapse in the market this year; however, even the
smallest of movements between pricing the BT sale and trading in the new
shares could have a significant effect on the issue.
A fall in the market wipes out potential investors' discounts while a rise
leaves the Treasury open to Labour accusations of a giveaway.
Government advisers believe the key lesson from the BP sale is that the time
between pricing and trading was too long.
Government sales normally take three weeks, a week to print and send the
prospectus after pricing is announced, a week for investors to receive and
fill in the form and a final seven days for allocation and processing.
If the prospectus could be sent out without the price officials believe they
could shave off seven days. This was suggested in the sale of the regional
electricity companies but rejected on the grounds that two weeks can create
as much nervousness as three.
For the BT sale to be made BP-proof and immune from market movements the gap
between the pricing and trading needs to cut to less than two weeks.
Shareholders need a guarantee that their discounts will not be wiped out by
movements in the market.
If this can be achieved Government advisers believe they may be able to do
without sub-underwriters. (Primary underwriters were dispensed with in the
last privatisation).
There are two other main lessons to be learnt from the BP sale.
The first is that ringfencing allocations to different markets is
counter-productive. In 1987 BP wanted more shares to be sold abroad.
Government officials now believe it was a mistake not to do so since it
would have generated greater competition between the institutions.
The Treasury is expected to introduce more flexibility into the BT sale,
allowing more than half of the shares to be sold in foreign markets,
creating fierce competition between institutions, thereby maximising the
price.
The second lesson is that while advertising can work wonders in druming up
interest in a issue - more than 6m people registered for the BP shares - it
does not mean that those registered will buy shares. A little more than
200,000 of the 6m parted with their money.
As a result much of the funds earmarked for advertising may end up paying
banks and building societies bigger commissions to trade BT shares, making
it easier for the small investors to take part in the sale.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Cronite puts two problem offshoots into
receivership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRONITE GROUP, the Birmingham-based industrial holding company, said
yesterday that it was putting into receivership two of its subsidiaries
where irregularities, including misappropriation, had been discovered.
The shares, suspended at 12p on April 5, rose to 23p when were restored to
listing after the announcement.
The bigger of the two subsidiaries is Cronite Alloys, which recycles
stainless steel. The other is Abtex, which manufactures hand portable fire
extinguishers.
The company said it also intended to close or dispose of two other
businesses, Hy-Tech, a machining company, and North American Cronite, a
sales organisation.
Accounts for the five months to end-February, also published yesterday,
showed total losses for the four companies, including closure costs, of
Pounds 3.05m. At the pre-tax line, the company incurred a Pounds 2.18m loss.
That compared with a Pounds 1.22m profit for the year to end-September.
Cronite said it had discovered that Alloys had suffered a shortfall in
expected income amounting to about Pounds 400,000 while management accounts
had overstated the value of certain stock by Pounds 500,000. At Abtex,
continuing trading difficulties had been exacerbated by misappropriation of
stock.
Concluding that continuation of losses at these two subsidiaries would have
an unsustainable effect on cash requirements, Cronite had requested
Barclays, its bank, to appoint receivers.
Mr James Lindsay-German, chief executive, said he could not comment on
whether the irregularities would give rise to any legal action. The decision
follows investigations by Arthur Anderson, the accountants.
Cronite said Barclays had confirmed the availability of facilities for the
remainder of the year, subject to an Pounds 8.2m maximum, and with this
arranged it hoped it would be able to develop its profitable businesses.
But there will be no interim dividend owing to a shortfall in distributable
reserves.
At the trading level, five-monthly losses at discontinued businesses were
Pounds 1.87m (against Pounds 70,000 for the 12 month period) while profits
at the rest of the group were Pounds 262,000 (Pounds 2.4m). Net assets per
share were 31.1p (48.2p).
The deterioration follows a sharp fall in profitability during the previous
year when pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m were about half their 1989 level.

The interim dividend is unchanged at 1p, and comes from earnings per share
down from 1.39p to 1.07p.

<TEXT>
THE OFFER for sale of Greencore, the formerly state-owned Irish Sugar group
which is being floated in London and Dublin, has been about 2.8 times
subscribed.
Yesterday the company said applications had been received for 111.8m shares,
against the 39.46m available. The offer price was IPounds 2.30.
Stripping out shares for which firm undertakings had been received and which
have been fully allotted, and those laid aside for employees and beet
growers, 15.52m shares were available generally. These attracted 87.86m
applications and they are being scaled down as follows:
Applications for 100 to 299 shares will result in the allocation of 100
shares; for 300-599, 200; for 600-999, 300; for 1,000 to 2,499, 400; for
2,500 to 4,999, 700; for 5,000 to 9,999, 1,250; for 10,000 to 15,999, 2,000.
Applications above 16,000 shares will receive one seventh of the amount
requested.
The sale, which marks the first big privatisation of an Irish state concern,
is of 55 per cent of the shares. Dealings are expected to commence on
Friday.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Travis Perkins declines to Pounds 20.36m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION in the UK housebuilding industry has caused pre-tax profits to
fall for the second year in succession at Travis Perkins, the builders'
merchant and timber group.
Last year profits fell by almost 38 per cent, from Pounds 32.8m to Pounds
20.36m. In the previous 12 months pre-tax profits fell by 16 per cent.
Mr Tony Travis, chairman said: 'The current year will be another difficult
one for the construction industry. The first three months of this year,
particularly January and February, were very poor. First-half profits,
therefore, will be down sharply on those achieved in the corresponding
period last year.
'The downturn is such that it will be very difficult to catch it up during
the rest of the year - even allowing for a recovery in the second half of
the year.'
Pre-tax profits last year were reduced by about Pounds 4m charged against
bad debts: 'Bad debts, as a proportion of sales, were about three times
higher than we would expect in a normal market,' said Mr Travis.
Redundancy costs reduced profits by a further Pounds 1.5m. There was an
exceptional charge of a similar amount to cover the final costs of
integrating the Travis Arnold and Sandall Perkins businesses, merged in
1988.
There was a net reduction of about 400 staff last year, achieved through a
combination of natural wastage and redundancy. The group, on the other hand,
raised about Pounds 3m from property sales.
Turnover fell by 3.6 per cent from Pounds 360.9m to Pounds 347.7m. Volume
sales were down by about a tenth. Profits in the second six months fell by
more than half to Pounds 6.9m. This compares with a 21 per cent fall to
Pounds 13.5m in the first half.
'The last quarter of 1990 was particularly gruelling, with bad debts and
redundancy costs adding to overheads as building activity continued to
decline,' said Mr Travis.
The group declared a final dividend of 5.5p making a total payment of 8p,
the same as in 1989. Dividends were 1.7 times covered by earnings per share
of 13.8p (22p).
COMMENT
About three quarters of Travis Perkins' sales go to the housing market for
repair, maintenance and improvement, as well as new house building. It is
therefore an ideal recovery stock as mortgage interest rates come down and
confidence in the housing sector starts to pick up. The company has no debt
and is well managed - gross margins actually improved slightly last year in
one of the most difficult periods for construction sales. The problem is in
gauging the timing and likely extent of the recovery. Housebuilders have
reported a rise in sales since interest rates began to fall in February.
Much of this, however, will be stock and it will take time for a recovery to
work through to building material sales. The company is right to be
cautious. Profits this year could slip further to about Pounds 18m. This
would put the group on a prospective p/e of 19 which looks expensive. Hold
for the long term and buy on weakness.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Mrs Fields warns of loss as Gulf war hits
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Mrs Fields cookie company yesterday slumped 4 1/2 p to 11p after
warnings that it had fallen back into the red in the last financial year.
In a brief statement, the USM-quoted company said its preliminary results
for the year to the end of December 1990 would be published late next month
and the company would show a net loss.
It is expected to blame television coverage of the Gulf war for keeping
people at home and depressing sales of cookies on the high street.
The company had previously been scheduled to announce its results today, and
the announcement dashed hopes that it would build on its modest return to
profit in 1989.
Last September, Mrs Fields reported lower net losses of Dollars 2.63m
(Dollars 3.53m) for the first half, fuelling hopes that the full-year result
could reach about Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.75m) against 1989's Dollars 1.53m.
After it floated on the USM in 1986, Mrs Fields acquired a notoriety for
disappointing shareholders, most notably in 1988 when it clocked up a net
loss of Dollars 18.9m.
Founders Mrs Debbi Fields and her husband stepped back from day-to-day
management last year.

<TEXT>
Arncliffe Holdings, the Leeds-based housebuilder, has requested a temporary
suspension of its shares, pending the conclusion of negotiations on a
capital injection and a strengthening of the board, writes Michiyo Nakamoto.
'We have been in negotiations for some time and they are now at an advanced
stage,' directors said. Once the negotiations are completed, the group plans
to announce both results for the year to October 31 and details of the
proposed capital investment in the group. The shares were suspended at 83p.
In the half-year to April 30, Arncliffe suffered an 83 per cent plunge in
profits to Pounds 148,000 (Pounds 868,000). Profits were hurt by a sharply
higher interest charge of Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 593,000). The group said at
the time that it was working to reduce borrowings as quickly as possible.
Turnover dropped 18 per cent to Pounds 7.52m (Pounds 9.18m) and the interim
dividend was passed (2.25p). Earnings per share were 1.94p (11.28p).

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Institutions attempt to install new
management at Budgens - Board considering a number of options for future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of institutional shareholders is attempting to remove Mr John
Fletcher as chairman of Budgens and install a new management team at the
troubled grocery chain.
IEP Securities, Electra Investment Trust, and Gartmore Investment Trust,
which together hold 27 per cent of the shares, have put a proposal to the
board 'concerning the future direction of the company'.
This is understood to involve the appointment of three new directors
including Mr John von Spreckelsen, and two associates, Mr Christian Williams
and Mr Graham Rigby.
Mr von Spreckelsen is credited with having rejuvenated KAFU-Wasmund
Handelsgesellschaft, a supermarket chain which is based in Bremen, Germany.
The group's proposal is said to be 'under active consideration' by the
Budgens' board although the company stated that it was also reviewing a
number of other options for developing the business.
In recent years, Budgens has recorded poor results having suffered from high
borrowings and the disruption caused by setting up a new distribution
centre. Yesterday one analyst described the performance of the company as
'utterly disastrous'.
Earlier this year, the company announced a severe drop in interim pre-tax
profits from Pounds 4.71m to Pounds 505,000 and analysts suggested it might
only make Pounds 1.5m in the full year.
Budgens, formerly known as Barker &amp; Dobson, runs a chain of 95 neighbourhood
grocery stores. It has faced stiff competition from Marks and Spencer and is
seen as being under further threat as J Sainsbury and Tesco again express
interest in developing their high street outlets.
Mr Fletcher, who became chairman and chief executive of Budgens in 1985,
failed to consummate a planned merger with Wm Low, the Scottish-based
supermarket chain, in 1989.
This followed a highly ambitious but ultimately abortive attempt to buy Dee
Corporation for Pounds 2bn.
Budgens has recently strengthened its board through the appointment of Mr
Derek Pretty as finance director in December 1989 and Mr Keith Clarke as
managing director in April 1990.
Budgens' shares, which have fallen sharply during the past two years, closed
2p higher yesterday at 47p.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Boddington makes strong attack on Devenish
board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BODDINGTON yesterday launched a blistering attack on Devenish, the West
Country brewer, accusing it of wasting millions of pounds of shareholders'
money.
In a document sent out to Devenish shareholders, containing details of its
Pounds 127.7m hostile takeover bid, Boddington, the pubs, hotels and
health-care group, accuses the Devenish board of wasting more than Pounds
80m on advertising new brands marketed under the Newquay Steam label.
Boddington says the investment by Devenish 'was ill-conceived from the
outset' and alleges that its failure has had an adverse effect on the
company's profitability.
It accuses Devenish of U-turns in its strategy in first buying wholesalers
only to sell them later, and queries the value attributed in the company's
accounts to the brewery.
For good measure, it says plans by Devenish to expand the number of its pubs
'has failed to materialise'.
Mr Hubert Reid, managing director of Boddington, said:
'Devenish's decision to invest in brewing and brands was a grave mistake.
'It was also badly executed. Its board is guilty of poor judgement and then
poorly carrying out those decisions.'
A spokesman for Devenish denied the charges and said there was nothing
substantially new in the document which still failed to address the fact
that Boddington's hostile bid 'substantially undervalues' the company.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Empire 'oui' to 125p cash bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPIRE STORES Group, the mail order retailer, has recommended its
shareholders to accept the 125p per share cash offer from Redoute Catalogue,
part of La Redoute, the French catalogue retail group.
Mr Martin Mays-Smith, chairman of Empire, recommended the offer although the
board believed it did 'not fully reflect the value of Empire'.
Empire claims a 7 per cent share of the UK mail order market. Its shares
were unchanged yesterday at 127p.
The recommendation was not supported by Gecos, the Italian retail group
which holds 24.2 per cent of Empire, has been a shareholder since 1984 and
has two representatives on the board. It is taking independent advice and
will clarify it's position by May 1.
It could remain a minority holder even if Redoute's offer succeeds, and if
sufficient other holders did not accept, the listing might be kept.
Redoute said last night it was pleased with the recommendation, but
concerned about a 'very gloomy trading statement' made by Empire as part of
its recommendation, and the lack of a profit forecast for the financial year
ending this weekend.
The first closing date for Redoute's offer is tomorrow but Redoute has
already promised to extend this to May 8.
Redoute said from the start that its offer, launched in mid-March, would not
be increased. This followed its purchase of a 12 per cent stake in Empire
from Great Universal Stores, the retail, property and finance company, and a
promise to GUS that the subsequent offer would be final.
Redoute already held almost 26 per cent of Empire when it bought the GUS
stake, giving it 37.9 per cent.
Mr Mays-Smith said Empire was recommending the offer, which values the group
at Pounds 49m, because trading had worsened since the group announced an
interim loss of Pounds 951,000 in January.
Sales had 'held up less well than we had expected' he said, and 'sales in
recent weeks have been particularly disappointing'. The group had also
suffered a rise in bad debts.
He said 'as a result the group's results in the current year will fall short
of those for which we had hoped at the time of my interim statement'.
Another reason for the recommendation was that the UK mail order industry
was being shaken up following the sale of Grattan to Otto Versand, the
German retailer, and the possible sale by Littlewoods of its mail order
side. This was likely to make the market more competitive. Also the
performance of Empire's shares, if it remained independent, was likely to be
affected by Redoute's holding.
The recommendation to shareholders also said they should accept 'unless a
higher offer is announced'. However, analysts said the chances of a rival
bid were slim given Redoute's stake. If a rival bidder had been interested
it would probably have shown its hand by now. Mr Mays-Smith said the group
was not in discussions with any other bidder.

FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Boot bucks sector trend with 19% rise to
Pounds 6.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAXABLE PROFITS of Henry Boot &amp; Sons, the Sheffield-based construction and
property group, rose by 19 per cent to Pounds 6.36m in 1990 to provide a
rare profits advance in what was a very difficult year for most construction
groups.
Turnover declined to Pounds 131.03m (Pounds 136.13m), but earnings rose 15
per cent to 76.1p (66.1p) per share. The company proposed a final dividend
of 18p to make a total of 25p. This compares with 21p in 1989.
Mr Jamie Boot, managing director, said the group had a much lower exposure
to residential and commercial property markets than many construction
companies which have suffered as a result of falling demand in these
markets. Boot has no borrowings.
At the end of 1989 Boot had cash of about Pounds 9m. This position is
thought to have remained largely unchanged at the end of last year.
The company, of which the Boot family owns just over 50 per cent, said the
construction market had of late become more difficult. It warned that it was
unlikely 'that the past level of growth in earnings will be maintained in
the foreseeable future'.

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN INTERNATIONAL investor group has reduced its bid for Consoltex, the
Montreal-based fabric maker, from CDollars 38 to CDollars 33 per share and
Coats Viyella, which has owned 81 per cent of the Canadian company for the
past decade, has said this was fair value and it would accept.
In February, Consoltex reported 1990 profits of CDollars 9m (Pounds 4.54m),
or CDollars 3.14 per share, on sales of CDollars 169m, up slightly from
1989. At that time the investor group was willing to pay CDollars 38 per
share. Coats stood to collect to well over CDollars 110m.
However, in the first quarter of this year, Consoltex incurred losses of
CDollars 596,000, or 20 cents per share (profits of CDollars 2.7m, or 95
cents per share). Sales dipped 25 per cent to CDollars 34m. Federal and
Quebec sales taxes were applied to apparel for the first time on January 1,
causing a deep decline in clothing sales and thus fabric sales.
Consoltex expects some improvement in the rest of the year as interest rates
come down and the economy picks up steam.
The old offer was withdrawn and 'a revised investor group' made the new
offer, subject to 90 per cent acceptance, said Coats and Consoltex. Details
will be mailed early in May.
Consoltex would not reveal the principals behind the investor group.

FT  23 APR 91 / Guinness Mahon losses soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS MAHON, the merchant banking group which is 65 per cent owned by the
Bank of Yokohama, warned yesterday that it would report a heavy loss in its
interim results because of mounting bad debts.
The company is making a Pounds 30m provision for loan losses, and will
report an after-tax loss of Pounds 35m for the six months ending March 31.
An interim dividend is unlikely to be declared.
The group will seek to raise Pounds 50m through a rights issue. This will
have the full support of the Bank of Yokohama. The Pounds 50m will more than
double the Pounds 45m level to which Guinness Mahon's capital has been
reduced by the losses.
Mr Geoffrey Bell, chairman of Guinness Mahon, said yesterday that the losses
had been incurred mainly because of the bank's policy of lending to the
property and small company sectors, both of which had been badly hit by the
recession. The bank had also lent Pounds 5m to Polly Peck, which collapsed
last year.
The provisions were decided on after a team from Bank of Yokohama came to
the UK to examine the Guinness Mahon loan book, Mr Bell said. It was decided
to deal conservatively with all possible losses to avoid having to make
further provisions later on.
No management changes are planned, but Mr Bell said that the Bank of
Yokohama would be placing more people in London to keep a closer watch on
operations. The Japanese have three representatives on Guinness Mahon's
12-person board.
The news triggered a sharp fall in Guinness Mahon's share price. The stock
closed at 42p, down 8p on the day. This compares with the 146p per share
paid by Bank of Yokohama. The Japanese group bought its stake for Pounds 95m
in 1989 in the first significant acquisition of a merchant bank by a bank

FT  23 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Ratners
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the reaction to yesterday's figures, investors think Ratners has
turned some kind of corner. The shares have underperformed the market by a
third in a year and by a half over three years, so a change was overdue.
Last year's small rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 112m was a reasonable
performance, especially when measured against other retailers. But there was
no hiding the dilutive effect of the undigested Kay Jewelers acquisition in
the US. Worryingly, too, costs in the UK rose much faster than sales.
Ratners is trying to persuade investors that it has grown up. Out has gone
the image of the mindless pursuit of sales. In its place is a sober
management culture in which costs must be contained to protect the bottom
line from the effects of flattening turnover. It all looks appropriate,
comes perhaps six months late and is arguably inevitable at such a low point
in the economic cycle.
In the medium term, Ratners will push ahead with the integration of Kay in
the US and try to grow organically towards 50 per cent market share in the
UK. Less expansionist shareholders might prefer to see the company
exploiting its UK leadership by forcing immediate price increases on a
sector where volume growth has tailed off. On forecast profits of Pounds
125m, the shares at 177p are on a prospective p/e of nine, backed by a solid
yield of 8 per cent. If Ratners can prove that it has cracked the US market,
its shares will doubtless more than make up lost ground. The rating seems
fair until then.

FT  23 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Retail sales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The quirky nature of the latest UK retail sales figure leaves the markets in
the dark on consumer spending just when guidance is most needed. Analysts
were yesterday kicking themselves for forgetting that the last VAT rise in
1979 led to a near-7 per cent jump in sales on the month, followed by a 10
per cent plunge the month after. But the rise in the VAT rate this time is
insignificant compared with last, especially since many retailers were
prompt to announce that they were not passing it on. If there has been a
real underlying recovery, it will be the more welcome after a run of seven
months in which retail volume was down on the year before. It is also the
more vexing to have to wait another month to find out.
That apart, the prospects for a consumer-led recovery are as opaque as ever.
It might be thought that real wage increases would be an important
determinant. But it remains to be seen what will happen if workers settle
for low nominal rises on the basis of plunging headline inflation, only to
find that the stubbornness of core inflation leaves them worse off than
before. The markets may have to settle for guidance on production rather
than consumption. Next Tuesday's quarterly survey from the Confederation of
British Industry, which ought to show the first signs of revival, will be
the most closely scrutinised for a long while.

FT  23 APR 91 / The Lex Column: AT&amp;T/NCR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
American Telephone and Telegraph's five-month bid for NCR looks to be over
bar a little more shouting. Sunday's improved offer from Ma Bell delivers
the Dollars 110 per share demanded by NCR, at least on the basis of the AT&amp;T
price at Friday's close. While the target company is demanding still more
protection for shareholders in the event of AT&amp;T stock slipping back, there
is a limit to which such guarantees can be reasonably extracted.
An agreed deal has always been on the cards, though Wall Street's strength
is helping resolve a corporate battle which has been grubby even by US
standards. AT&amp;T has been beleaguered on several fronts. It may have
scuppered NCR's plan to put 8 per cent of the votes into the hands of its
employees but, as things stand, it is due back in court soon to try to
remove another poison pill. The telecoms giant has managed to unseat only
four members of the NCR board and is faced with the ousted chairman
continuing the fight as chief executive, while staff morale at both
companies may soon become an issue. With all these problems banking up, it
seems prudent to take advantage of the healthier share price, pay a little
more and hope NCR goes quietly.
The all-paper nature of the new offer is crucial, since it would allow AT&amp;T
to account for the takeover without having to write off goodwill against
earnings. AT&amp;T shareholders nevertheless face some short-term dilution. They
will also have a long wait for the benefits, though that is not to say they
will not come. It is just that the precedents for merging computer and
communications businesses - very much a 1980s idea - are not terribly
auspicious.

FT  23 APR 91 / The Lex Column: The Bundesbank marks time
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,490.8 (-29.3)
Despite the headlines about the surging dollar, the real story in the
foreign exchange markets still looks to be the weakness of the D-Mark. Given
the dissent among the Group of Seven, there might seem a hint of perversity
about this. Germany argues for monetary tightness and the US for laxity, yet
money continues to flow from the D-Mark to the dollar. Allowing for the
difficulty of measuring the unified German economy, it is not even clear
that money supply growth in the two economies is wildly different by now.
With the help of such mishaps as Chancellor Kohl's election defeat at the
weekend, sentiment on the D-Mark is running downhill.
To an extent, one can see the market's point. The way ahead for the US
economy is pretty clear, apart from matters of timing. The outlook for
Germany is profoundly unclear on virtually everything, including basic
economic policy. The risk premium on the D-Mark, as measured by the interest
rate differential, has been rising steadily for the past six months and now
stands at a full 3 percentage points. For the Bundesbank, the immediate
problem is that the US interest rate cycle may already have hit bottom, so
that a rise in German rates may be needed merely to stop the differential
widening further. It is hard to see how the Bundesbank can reassert its
authority other than by catching the market unawares with the timing and
extent of its next rate rise. By definition, if the Bundesbank gets it right
there could be shocks ahead for the other members of the ERM.

FT  23 APR 91 / Letter: The case for an international adviser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN READING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader ('The new consensus', April 20 ) spots the irony in the
announcement on the same day last week of Sir Terence Burns' promotion from
chief economic adviser to permanent secretary to the Treasury, with news of
a record rise in unemployment and an accelerating fall in industrial
production. Later you support the need for some sort of National Economic
Assessment - while your Job in the News article below the leader sought a
bright, pragmatic economist for Sir Terence's old job. Following the
failures in economic management in the 1980s, perhaps you should have gone
further.
Fiscal policy is now on auto-pilot and monetary policy is dictated by
exchange rate considerations. British economic prospects depend largely on
what is happening to the rest of the world. The Treasury no longer uses
macro-economic forecasts to steer the economy. Nor does it produce reliable
forecasts for others. This job, and the National Assessment, should be
handed over to independent well-financed economic research institutes.
The Treasury's forecasting errors for the British economy are well known.
But it is possibly worse at predicting international economic prospects on
which our future now rests. The 1990 budget forecasts, for example,
predicted that the US current account deficit and the Japanese surplus would
increase while the large German surplus, despite unification, would remain
broadly unchanged.
This suggests that Sir Terence's old post, as chief economic adviser, might
also be abolished. Instead, the government should appoint an international
economic adviser, so as to be better informed on what is going on in the
rest of the world. Moreover, in looking for candidates, it should consider
an American, German, French or even a Japanese.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From DB ROBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial (Housing and inflation, April 16) suggests that lowering
the value of housing would help to curb inflation. The only sound long-term
way of reducing price pressure on housing is to increase supply, and that
would naturally follow a full revival of the letting sector.
Sadly, that can happen only when all political parties are in agreement,
since too many fingers have been burnt for landlords to enter the letting
market with confidence.
In the meantime you can hold back house price inflation with high interest
rates in the same way as a dam holds back water - the pent-up demand is
still there, and will manifest itself when it is able to.

FT  23 APR 91 / Letter: Interim solution for Treuhand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DEREK MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'So much to do, so little time' (April 9) mirrors
precisely the fundamental problem of managing change. David Goodhart's
report on the Treuhand's fear that lack of appropriate management resource
could lead to wastage of money on a massive scale echoes the gap being
experienced by many more developed commercial and industrial organisations.
Their recourse has been to interim management.
For a long time the concept of short-term executives has been one of a
stop-gap solution. That this is no longer the case is a tribute to the
high-level experienced people from all over Europe who are prepared to roll
up their sleeves, tackle a specific assignment, achieve significant results
and move on to the next project, adding value through their business skills,
motivation, and lack of emotional excess baggage.
If the Treuhand wishes to attract the type of manager who will enjoy the
challenge of participation in the resurrection of a market economy, the
interim management route is an obvious solution.

FT  23 APR 91 / Visionary seeks an equal chance: Lech Walesa, the Polish
president, who begins a state visit to Britain today, outlines his hopes for
his country's future in an interview with FT writers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's first democratically elected president, Mr Lech Walesa, arrives in
London today for a three-day state visit. He is a complex mixture of
intuitive vision, political shrewdness, religious conviction, unexpected
naivety - and personal charm. It is a combination which helped him play a
key role in the collapse of communism, and is now being used to win Poland a
place in Europe and woo foreign investment.
Last week in Warsaw he talked to FT correspondents about Poland's hopes and
fears, starting with the prospect of 2m unemployed before the year is out.
Q: Will you have to ask Poles for 'blood, sweat and tears'?
A: I don't agree with this perspective. Poland can't afford unemployment. It
has so much work to do, so many needs. Our problem is not over-production
but shortages. We have an educated society but antiquated systems and
machines. That's why we need help from abroad. Even if Poland had twice as
many people we could not catch up with the west in 20 years. So let foreign
business come here, then there won't be unemployment and I can save the
country.
Are you saying there won't be unemployment?
No, no. There could be more than 2m unemployed. The point is there should
not be any, given the size of our needs.
What will you be seeking in Britain?
I'll be doing some blunt talking. Europe is not Europe without Britain, but
there are mistakes in western thinking. Europe fears that we'll take away
markets. But I'm convinced there is work for all here in Poland for 10 years
just to fill in the gaps in our economy. We should learn to assess our
potential on a Europe-wide scale. Look at Nowa Huta (a big steel works). Its
pollution is destroying Krakow. Shouldn't we give up producing steel and buy
from France which has non-polluting factories? But then France has to help
find work for the 60,000 who lose their jobs.
We allow imports of all goods but the west is not buying ours. Why are we
being punished? We could end up like Romania which has nothing but
shortages. If we don't find a common language my farmers won't allow the
import of food from the west. But this is not what should be happening.
We want to join the European institutions. But Europe is afraid to let us
in. Yet, it's so simple. We should all stand at the starting line as if in a
race. I'll be on a bicycle, others on tractors, some in cars. Who wins is
his affair. That's the thinking we should have - everyone should have an
equal chance.
Computers should have a hand in all this. The computer should fire a public
starting signal. It should not be a confidential one so that someone gets an
unfair lead.
That places a lot of faith in computers. Comecon tried that and failed.
That's true. But the first fruit is always full of worms.
What do European leaders say when you make these points to them?
No one has countered my arguments yet. They may complain that the way I put
my views is too brutal but no one has found convincing counter-arguments to
my vision of European development.
Do you see these leaders as short-sighted?
No, but things are changing so fast, and they can't take all factors into
account. I have a great advantage. I'm not tied to any party. Politicians as
a rule are limited by their political affiliations and programmes.
It is said you model yourself on Pilsudski. (Marshal Jozef Pilsudski, who
gained enormous popularity by defeating the Red Army at the gates of Warsaw
in 1920 and later established an increasingly authoritarian regime in the
inter-war years.) Is that right?
No. Of course, I respect Pilsudski. But I'm a different person. Look at the
contrast in our achievements. Pilsudski won great victories with enormous
losses and people were very enthusiastic. We have achieved an enormous
victory over communism without bloodshed - but people aren't happy.
We've achieved so much and so subtly. We've handed Europe victory on a
plate, and the opportunity to link all Europe up on a healthy basis. Yet
just look what Europe is doing. (At this point the president screws up his
face in a gesture of fastidiousness and waves his hands from side to side.)
It does not want to get involved . . . it hums and haws.
Generations have fought for this great chance. Well, now we have it. The
question is, Will we screw it up?
Everything ought to be possible - entry into Nato, into the European
Community, everything. But what are we doing? Just waiting for the next
earthquake. It's amazing. Incredible.
If there'd been the usual victory with corpses all over the place there
would have been enthusiasm.
Somehow everything has changed. It used to be the Germans who did the
fighting and the Jews the trading. Now it's the Germans who are fighting for
peace, the Jews who are fighting and the Poles who are trading. Maybe that's
why things are upside down, everybody is playing unfamiliar roles.
What about the situation to the east?
This is a new era. Of course, new nations and social groups want their
freedom. They are casting aside their chains. Take the Czechs and Slovaks.
Now they're arguing. But this is just the initial phase. After that they'll
start coming together again. Modern economies transcend national boundaries
and dangers like Chernobyl are also no respecter of borders.
Five years ago I said that the Soviet Union had only one option - to
dissolve itself. But no one took me seriously. I'm now saying that it will
dissolve but come together again on new principles, on logical principles.
As for Poland, we need foreign investment because it also gives us security.
Having a Frenchman or an Englishman here with his factory is like having a
division of troops. You in the west have over-production. You can make money
out of our shortages and our stupidity - and we have plenty of that.
We can't just escape in your direction because it is already full up. I want
to turn round the escape routes. That's where business can be done. Business
should come here rather than wait for people to flee west. Come and set up a
factory here. Make money.
Some people say, 'Walesa is selling Poland cheap'. Our people are
intelligent but we received our education under communism. We need western
help to show us how to do things. We don't want charity or sentiment. We
have to be taught in the brutal school of life. The quicker we start the
quicker we'll learn.
You won power because the communists could not deliver economically. But
aren't things getting worse for many?
If I was to run for election now I'd get 90 per cent. The new government
(led by the prime minister Mr Jan Bielecki) is full of competent people.
True, they are from the third division. They're not well-known. But that's
how I wanted it. They want to join the first division and they'll work hard
to get there. You know how the first division acts. They sit there smoking
their pipes and thinking about things. That's OK in other conditions but not
now.
I'm a man who gets down to resolving problems. I don't ask whether it's the
done way or not. I raise issues. People don't always understand my motives.
But the president must always have answers and propose his own solutions -
he can't allow himself to be taken by surprise. I'm not taking a
conventional approach and you should be careful how you assess what I am
doing.
My role is a fluid one, searching for solutions and forcing people into
democracy. Let parliament get angry. Let them rebel. I want to force people
to think. I want to provoke them out of the theories of communism.
After 50 years of communism you cannot just impose a better system on
people. The thing is to provoke them and point them in the right direction.
But if there was a threat (to democracy) and events go in a wrong direction
then something decisive would have to be done.
We won't get to democracy with an apathetic society. People have been fooled
by politicians in the past and have to understand what's going on. That's
why I provoke them into arguing and thinking. I don't want them sitting on
sofas smoking pipes. That's for 50 years' time.

FT  23 APR 91 / Letter: Pensions below 60 still a matter of discretion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL GREENWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Waters' article on pensions in the Finance Bill ('Revenue paves
way for curbs', April 18) gives a strong inference that pension ages below
60 are no longer allowed in any circumstance.
The change in clause 33 of the Finance Bill amending allowable retirement
ages applies only to schemes approved by the Inland Revenue under mandatory
approval.
Few occupational schemes are approved under this route. The vast majority,
probably more than 99 per cent, are approved under Revenue discretionary
approval. The clauses on discretionary approval give the Inland Revenue very
wide powers. For instance, in some circumstances for certain occupations,
footballers and deep sea divers for example, they have approved pension
schemes with normal pension ages considerably below those allowed under
mandatory approval. There is nothing in the Finance Bill which changes or
restricts such practice.
The Inland Revenue is believed to be currently reviewing its discretionary
practices. An announcement is now expected in September in the form of the
issue of new Inland Revenue Practice Notes. These notes summarise how it
exercises its discretion granted to its under the legislation. It could well
be that for ordinary schemes under its discretionary powers the Inland
Revenue restricts pension ages to the band from age 60 to 75, irrespective
of sex.
However, until the issue of new Practice Notes or some other announcement,
it is not actually known what the Inland Revenue's attitude with regard to
pension ages will be for the vast majority of pension schemes.

FT  23 APR 91 / Leading Article: The price of British gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most important moments so far in the short history of regulating
Britain's privatised but still over-mighty utilities is almost upon us.
British Gas is in the final stages of negotiations with its regulator, the
Office of Gas Supply, to determine the formula which will set the prices
paid by 17m domestic gas customers from April 1992.
The Ofgas review of domestic prices began in June of last year and has been
a wide-ranging affair. It needs to be; last year, gas prices went up twice -
by 7.5 per cent in March and by between 3.3 and 3.7 per cent in November.
These increases were justified under the current formula, which links the
price of gas to the retail price index, minus 'x', plus 'y', where 'x' is a
2 per cent efficiency factor and 'y' is the cost to British Gas itself of
obtaining raw fuel.
It is to be hoped that Ofgas, with the help of two external accountants, is
taking a robustly sceptical view of both the 'x' and 'y' factors. Although
the British Gas publicity machine has been active in recent months in
presenting the results of its own customer surveys, there remains a
suspicion that this private sector near-monopoly still needs to shed more
than a few pounds in weight. It has not, to take just one example, been
driving particularly hard bargains on the pay front.
Searching inquiry
As for the cost of British Gas's raw materials, there are also good grounds
for searching inquiry. The company's dominance of the retail market does not
necessarily give it the strongest possible incentive to obtain the lowest
cost supplies and there is, at the very least, room to question British
Gas's efficiency as an operator of its own gas fields. At the point of
privatisation, it was impossible for any outsider to unscramble British
Gas's accounts to make a fair judgment on these points. Ofgas will have let
down gas customers very badly if it has failed to sort out the figures.
Ofgas has also served notice that it intends to reconsider the appropriate
return for British Gas, the value of its assets and new ways in which it can
be held accountable for standards of service.
The next stage of this lengthy process, due in the next week, is that
British Gas has to inform Ofgas whether it accepts the regulator's proposed
pricing formula. If it does not, the matter is automatically referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission for detailed examination.
MMC involvement
There is a very strong case for MMC involvement, not least because it would
expose to public scrutiny the detail of Ofgas's case and British Gas's
response. One of the biggest problems caused by the misjudged privatisation
of British Gas, which was allowed to keep most of its monopoly power, is
that the kind of public disclosure which was to some extent required of a
nationalised industry can now be resisted on grounds of commercial
confidentiality.
As the rules stand, however, British Gas can avoid a bruising run-in with
the MMC simply by agreeing to the Ofgas plan. It is to be hoped, in that
event, that one element in the Ofgas proposal is that there should be full
public exposure of its analysis. There is no point in Ofgas setting itself
up as a policeman of the meter man's punctuality if its essential
calculations about prices are lost in obscurity.
Nor should the politicians who designed the regulatory regime in gas make
the mistake of thinking that these are matters of little interest to voters.
Energy prices are uncontroversial so long as they are relatively stable. But
the new gas price formula will cover the period from 1992 to 1997. It will
only take a modest oil and gas price shock in that period to turn the arcane
algebra of Ofgas into front page news.
Regulating a company as powerful as British Gas is not easy, and so far
Ofgas has had only modest success in stimulating competition in the
industrial gas market. For domestic customers, Ofgas looks like remaining
the only protection against the abuse of monopoly power. That is why its
next move on prices needs to be rigorous and visibly so.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One person who won't be at today's annual general meeting of National
Westminster Bank - although he probably should be - is John Tugwell who has
been handed the unhappy job of sorting out NatWest Bancorp. He is the one
banker who knows how bad things really are at NatWest's problematic US
subsidiary.
Then again, since he arrived in New York less than a fortnight ago and only
five days before NatWest Bancorp revealed it lost Dollars 191m in the first
quarter, perhaps his absence can be excused.
Even by US banking standards NatWest Bancorp has been doing pretty badly,
and 50-year-old Tugwell says he has been working day and night since he
first arrived. He has rented an apartment on Manhattan's East side and is
intent on rallying his 7,500 troops by being NatWest's man in the trouble
spot.
Parachuting Tugwell into the top spot at NatWest Bancorp is a risk both for
him and his employer. Having been involved in the 1977-78
acquisition of National Bank of North America, he is closely associated with
NatWest's expensive acquisition strategy in the US. With interest rates
falling there, the injection of yet more of the parent's capital means
Tugwell may be able to stage-manage an impressive turnaround.
If he can, then he's well placed to follow in the footsteps of Tom Frost,
NatWest's chief executive, who made his name in the US. But if matters take
a turn for the worse,
Tugwell could face a similar fate to Midland Bank's John Harris. Once viewed
as the next chief executive, Harris never recovered from being sent to keep
an eye on Midland's disastrous Crocker acquisition in California.
Unlike Harris, who had to work alongside a US chief executive, Tugwell has
been given sole responsibility for NatWest's US operations. It is make or
break time all round.

In itself, frost is not all that unusual at this time of year. But the
attack last Saturday night fell in parts as low as - 7 deg C, and it
followed a particularly mild spell which had brought on the vegetation of
the vines unexpectedly early.
In consequence, the total Bordeaux vintage this year is already expected to
drop by around half, from 800m to 400m bottles. Moreover, not merely will
the quantity be down, the quality will also be jeopardised.
Some vineyards will be much worse hit than the average; the harvest in Medoc
may be down by 70 per cent, and the vintage in some individual vineyards in
St Emilion, Graves, Entre-Deux-Mers and Pomerol may be completely wiped out.
Wine experts, who last year were groping for superlatives to describe the
recent run of superb vintages, are now groping for comparisons for an
equally disastrous frost.

While Manchester United seek stock-market flotation, Sheffield Wednesday,
who beat them in Sunday's Rumbelows League Cup final, might turn to the FT
Ordinary index to appreciate just how long it had been since they last won a
Wembley final.
It was 1935, the year the Ordinary was launched. On Sunday, the index (base
100) stood at 1980.1. We are told that the 1935 Wembley programme cost one
old penny. Sunday's cost Pounds 3 - a 720-fold increase.

FT  23 APR 91 / Observer: Wrong signal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an awful lot of humbug talked about top executives' pay. Even so
the news that Sir Ian MacLaurin, Tesco's retailing superstar, is taking home
Pounds 1.5m is bound to raise eyebrows.
He is not in the same league as Sir Ralph Halpern, Burton's ex-chief
executive, and he has made a lot of money for Tesco shareholders. But the
problem with such seemingly massive pay increases today is twofold.
They send the wrong sort of signal to a workforce under pressure to squeeze
costs.
Second, tying management incentive schemes so closely to earnings-per-share
growth - perhaps at the expense of balance sheet prudence - can be
dangerous.
It is time companies spelt out the terms of their executive incentive
schemes in the annual report right from the start. Then bonanzas like
MacLaurin's would not be such a surprise.

Forget the opening of Miss Saigon on Broadway. It will be thoroughly
upstaged by this year's biggest first night on October 12, bringing the
first performance of John Godber's comedy Happy Families at the Caxton
Theatre in Grimsby . . . the Questor's in Ealing . . . the Progress, Reading
. . . not to mention 47 more.
The whole lot are building their autumn season of amateur theatricals around
the play, thanks to what used to be called British Telecom which has
extended its arts sponsorship into the cut-throat world of amateur
dramatics.
Sponsors usually avoid amateurs like the plague. But when consultant James
Cook proposed the commissioning of a new play for simultaneous performances
by the 64-strong Little Theatre Guild, BT saw the PR possibilities.
The idea has been taken up by 50 members of the guild, which represents the
top league of Britain's 12,000 theatrical groups. In July all the directors
involved will gather at the BT Training Centre to be guided by Godber, who
has written Happy Families with amateurs in mind - a cast of a dozen,
heavily weighted towards women.
The event will cost BT around Pounds 50,000, and be repeated in two years
time, perhaps with Alan Ayckbourn as the playwright in charge. The sponsor
will use the first nights for entertaining customers. You have been warned.

FT  23 APR 91 / Arts: Osud - Semper Opera, Dresden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One's heart goes out to Dresden. With blackened stone ruins still peering
out of the rubble in parts of the city centre and socialist architecture
dominating the rest, the people now face another form of reconstruction -
their economy, their livelihood, their self-esteem.
With industry at a standstill, tens of thousands out of work and a growing
disillusionment with the promises made at reunification, what priority does
music have in people's lives? The city's two main music institutions - the
Semper Opera and the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra  - will survive, but
much of the cultural substructure will not. The first night of Osud was less
than three-quarters full. That says less about the Dresdeners' lack of
curiosity (or about ticket prices, which are still extremely low), than that
they have other preoccupations in these hard times.
Osud marks the end of an era: it is Joachim Herz's last production in
Dresden. He has worked there in comparative obscurity for the past ten
years, but his production style and cantankerous personality have made him
superfluous to the incoming artistic team led by Christoph Albrecht. Herz's
decision to take the Saxon state government to court over the ending of his
contract makes a sad spectacle.
Osud illustrated two classic traits in postwar German opera production - a
natural animation of the stage, releasing the inner impetus of the music,
which is Herz's inheritance from Walter Felsenstein; and a congenital
tendency to over-interpret. Act one was beautiful. Reinhart Zimmermann's
permanent set consisted of a gently stepped wooden platform, which together
with Eleonore Kleiber's costumes preserved the period charm of Janacek's
setting. Behind lay a wall of large slanted mirrors, reflecting the stations
in Zivny's relationship with Mila - the first rapture of eyes meeting, the
exchange of roses after one of Zivny's concerts. But the chief distinction
lay in Herz's choreography of the spa scenes - the sedate bourgeoisie, the
carefree couples, the brood of schoolgirls - so that everyone on stage was
an individual, without a trace of the artificial movement that has become
synonymous with Herz's successors at the Komische Oper.
The domestic setting of Act two was suggested by little more than a settee,
a kitchen dresser and a precipitous flight of stairs. Here Herz depicted the
interlocking pressures on Zivny - mother-in-law, creative crisis, marriage
strains, alcohol problem - through a series of equally convincing vignettes.
Having respected Janacek's awkward but viable dramatic outline thus far,
Herz then made a complete mess of the final act. Zivny's tortured solos were
transposed to the beginning, as he wrestled with skeletons of the past
(bombed-out buildings, machine-gunfire and the usual German militaristic
cliches) in an attempt to reactivate his creative inspiration. After a
shortened conservatoire scene, with Mila reincarnated as the impressionable
student Souckova, Zivny ended up in a mental clinic. For anyone who saw the
ENO and Dusseldorf stagings in the mid-1980s, both of which were faithful to
Janacek's original, Herz's solution was nothing more than a piece of
interpretative hack-work.
No such reservations about the musical performance, which was consistently
inspired. The rhythmic buoyancy and clean, light-fingered articulation of
the orchestral playing under Hans Zimmer showed that the Staatskapelle can
be as idiomatic in Janacek as they are in Richard Strauss. Zivny was sung by
Michael Rabsilber, whose pointed Germanic high tenor and sensitive acting
made him a near-ideal interpreter. In spite of being handicapped by dark
glasses and a spooky white cape, Kerstin Witt as Mila's mother acted the
disintegrating old harridan to the hilt. But the chief glory of the
performance lay in Vlatka Orsanic's Mila, a vibrant, radiant soprano who
phrased her soaring lines with moving eloquence.

FT  23 APR 91 / Management (The Growing Business): Clubbing together in a
local network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authorities should be required to assess the economic impact on small
and medium-sized businesses of all policy proposals they make. This is one
of the recommendations made in a study* of local support networks carried
out by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte and Business in the Community.
Councillors and local government officers should be encouraged to think
through the impact of their programmes on local firms with the aim of
reducing the burden on business.
The models for this suggestion are the economic impact assessments required
by the European Commission and the UK government on draft legislation.
A first step to building a healthy local business environment is to identify
key players in the community, the study says. These would include the local
council, businesses, the Training and Enterprise Council (Tec), enterprise
agencies, chamber of commerce and higher education.
These organisations should agree the outline of the future economic
development of the area and identify their role in achieving it.
Enterprise agencies should be best placed to counsel small businesses; the
chamber could provide information on continental European markets; while the
local authority economic development unit might have details of sites
available.
The availability of information about local business support also needs to
be improved, the report says. Businesses requiring assistance should be able
to get help by making not more than two telephone calls. Many organisations
advocate the grouping of different help organisations under one roof but the
development of information technology makes this less necessary, the study
argues.
However, the use of information technology between providers of business
support is patchy and compares unfavourably with the systems in use in
continental Europe.
The study urges better publicity about business support groups through the
publication of directories and free magazines. The local authority also has
an important role to fulfil in promoting a positive image of the area.
As a next step Business in the Community has set up a target team to
investigate good practice in other European countries which could be applied
in the UK.

FT  23 APR 91 / Management (The Growing Business): Lower overheads and
increased productivity: Subcontracting - Charles Batchelor on the benefits
of off-site production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elf Holdings, a Slough-based company which supplies audio equipment to
schools, is well into a programme to run down its own manufacturing
operations and to subcontract the work to Remploy, which provides
manufacturing services to a wide range of businesses.
Elf will cease manufacturing at its Brighton factory and hand over
responsibility for making products such as cassette recorders and public
address systems to Remploy's factory in Islington, north London. Some of the
Brighton employees will switch to repair and service work but the overall
result will be the loss of 10 jobs, reducing Elf's workforce to 22 people.
Chris Crump, managing director of Elf, expects that the move to
subcontracting will reduce production costs and relieve it of the burden of
coping with an uneven order flow. (Remploy produces for many companies so it
can control its own workload.)
Elf, which has sales of Pounds 2m, will assemble kits of components and
deliver them to Remploy though it may later arrange for its suppliers to
deliver directly to the subcontractor.
Crump, who joined Elf a year ago to ginger up a flagging performance, says
he considered moving production to Slough but this would still have required
him to make a judgment on the size of the workforce he would need to meet
fluctuating demand. Sourcing products from the Far East was not an option
either because schools frequently require modifications to the standard
items Elf supplies.
The complexity of many products has meant that large companies in areas such
as automobile manufacture and engineering have long moved to extensive
subcontracting of specialised components. Increasingly, smaller companies
are turning to subcontracting, either to reduce the cost of getting started
or to bring down the overheads of a long-established activity.
Small and medium-sized businesses, those employing fewer than 500 people,
account for no less than 82 per cent of Remploy's customers and 61 per cent
of its turnover, the company calculates.
'It is even more important for the smaller company, with its limited
resources, to focus on certain activities and subcontract out the rest,'
says Brian Small, managing director of Ingersoll Engineers, a Rugby-based
consultancy.
The present recession, which has made companies even more aware of the need
to reduce costs, is providing a spur for more businesses to subcontract out
parts of their operations. Manufacturing savings, together with reductions
in other areas such as premises and stocks can allow businesses to finance
the restructuring of their operations from their own resources, says Small.
Frequently the crunch comes when a business decides it needs to modernise
its production capacity. Gent, a Leicester-based manufacturer of fire
detection and alarm equipment, took a hard look at its metal fabrication
shop when it was planning a move to a new factory.
'We had lots of ancient small presses and turning machines making rings,
contacts, even screws,' says Andrew Robinson, managing director. 'We
realised our main strength was electronics so we didn't want dirty, oily
activities alongside. In addition our tooling was getting old and it would
have taken a big investment to replicate.'
Gent, which has sales of Pounds 24m and which forms part of RTZ Corporation,
shed most of its metal fabrication activities. The buy-in value of the
abandoned components was only Pounds 500,000 a year and the profit
improvement was less than Pounds 100,000 but the saving in terms of the
'distraction value' to management of these peripheral activities was
significant, Robinson says.
But there are further considerable benefits to be gained from buying in or
subcontracting parts of a company's activities:
Deciding to buy in rather than make can have an important impact on the
market-awareness of a company, argues Brian Small. Companies which make a
fetish of manufacturing all or most of the components required are less
likely to be oriented towards the needs of their customers.
Small businesses may be able to improve quality control by handing over
responsibility for manufacturing to a large, more sophisticated
subcontractor. 'If something goes wrong Remploy's quality control can pick
it up,' says Robert Belcher, managing director of Manrose Manufacturing, a
supplier of domestic fans. Both Remploy and Manrose's supplier of plastic
mouldings have obtained BS5750, the main UK standard for quality control,
but Manrose itself has yet to qualify. Increasingly, customers are requiring
suppliers to conform to this standard.
A subcontractor can help a customer even out uneven order flows and hold-ups
in the supply of components. Hayward Tyler Fluid Dynamics, a Luton-based
manufacturer of specialised pumps, has subcontracted out fabrication and
plating operations accounting for 5-10 per cent of total activities as part
of a far-reaching restructuring programme. Hayward Tyler employs 250 people,
down from 440, and has sales of Pounds 20m.
'This will give us flexibility,' says Roger Harrop, chief executive of
Hayward Tyler and of its parent company, Sterling Fluid Systems. 'It will be
easier to switch off a subcontractor than our own people.' The company's
plating shop had anyway only been used for three days a month, he adds.
Sub-contracting can also improve a company's cash flow. Instead of paying
weekly wages to the shop floor workforce the company moves to paying the
subcontractor on 30 or 60-day terms. The company can also set the cost of
the subcontractor's services immediately against profits whereas investment
in capital equipment usually takes place over a number of years.
But the decision to subcontract out parts or even all of a business's
manufacturing operations can be highly charged. Some companies believe the
benefits of subcontracting outweigh the loss of total control of their
activities. Others are sensitive about admitting that they are sticking
their own label on someone else's product.
Production specialists say that before considering whether to buy-in rather
than make a particular item managers must decide which activities are core
to their company's survival. High value items and products which involve
confidential design features and manufacturing techniques should always be
made in-house, says James Byers of Ingersoll Engineers. Stock items such as
nuts, bolts, bearings and washers, or loss-makers essential to the company's
range should be contracted out.
In addition, managers must be prepared for a short-term disruption of
production when they subcontract work out. 'We had a few teething problems
in the first six months,' says Gent's Andrew Robinson. 'It was not easy to
get someone else to make items which our own skilled workers had been making
for 20 years.'
Managers must monitor the relationship with the subcontractor very closely.
One start-up business which subcontracted out the plastic injection moulding
on which it depended was set back for a year when it was forced to replace a
large number of products which customers returned as being faulty. 'We
assumed there would be someone at the subcontractor who had an overall view
of the project but there wasn't,' says the company's executive director.
But the difficulties do not always lie with the subcontractor. Companies are
frequently unrealistic in their forecasts of production volumes, says Edward
Selby, business manager of Remploy's southern region factories. Managers
sometimes misjudge the market for their product but they may also
deliberately exaggerate volumes to negotiate a keen price from the
subcontractor.
Nor is it unknown for managers to order wildly excessive volumes of raw
materials. 'If a customer thinks his product will sell for a number of years
he buys a massive quantity of raw materials. If a juggernaut pulls up
outside your door with three years' worth of materials it is difficult to
tell the customer you can't let them in,' Selby explains. Subcontracting
should not be seen as an easy way of disposing of the complexities of
running a manufacturing operation, the experts warn. But properly handled it
can have a significant impact on costs and on the ability of a smaller
company to service its customers.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH venture capital companies are increasingly willing to consider
making direct investments in small publicly-listed companies, according to
UK Venture Capital Journal*. This would mark a significant shift in the
industry's traditional role and could confuse investor perceptions of
venture capital.
The journal signals three reasons for this development:
The increasing size of venture capital investments in recent years, in
particular the industry's involvement in financing buy-outs, means there
would be little difference in scale between the funding needs of quoted and
unquoted companies. Thirty four per cent of the 1,700 companies with a full
stock market listing are capitalised at less than Pounds 20m while 70 per
cent are valued at less than Pounds 100m.
There is little difference between the management style of smaller quoted
companies and those remaining private.
As their portfolios mature more venture capital com-panies have holdings in
com-panies which have obtained a listing.
Investments in listed companies are potentially attractive because they are
more easily disposed of while smaller quoted companies have traditionally
outperformed large companies, the journal notes.
On the downside venture capitalists might be hard put to explain to their
own backers why they should invest in quoted companies by means of a venture
capital company when they could invest directly in the stock exchange. The
venture capitalist would also have difficulties gaining the same detailed
information from a listed company that he demands when making a private
company investment. Despite these drawbacks more venture capitalists are
inserting discreet clauses in their fund-raising prospectus which would
allow them to make direct investments in listed companies, the journal
notes.
Among recent listed company deals it identifies a Pounds 14.2m investment in
Hunter Saphir, a food group, in the form of convertible preference shares,

FT  23 APR 91 / Technology: Technically Speaking - Software directive makes
users losers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Computing policy is undoubtedly too important to be left entirely to the
technical experts, but problems arise when officials and politicians try to
resolve arguments between differing computer factions without fully
understanding the implications of their actions.
Look at the current state of affairs resulting from Brussels' seemingly
meritorious efforts over the past couple of years to protect suppliers of
computer software from piracy, a mess compounded by the peculiar procedural
requirements of the European Parliament.
To recap briefly. Two years ago, an EC directive was drafted with the aim of
harmonising measures to outlaw software piracy across the member states.
It specifically forbade unauthorised reverse engineering - analysing a piece
of software to understand what its does and how it does it. That proposal
was flawed in that while reverse engineering is used by software pirates, it
is also a key technology for computer manufacturers. They need to be able to
attach their equipment to that of their competitors; computer users have to
be able to modify and extend their existing software.
It is unlikely the authors of the draft fully understood the implications of
their work. The directive suited PC software suppliers and the larger
manufacturers - namely IBM and Digital Equipment - but outraged their
smaller competitors and customers. The competitors, including Groupe Bull
and Olivetti, formed a lobby called the European Committee for Interoperable
Systems (ECIS); users formed the Computer Users of Europe.
There was a second dimension. IBM and Digital saw the directive as a way of
defending their software against the Japanese. The issue became a war or
words fought between the US and Japan in the cockpit of Europe.
Commissioners in Brussels and Members of the European Parliament in
Strasbourg are by now no doubt heartily sick of the issue. They have been
lobbied mercilessly by representatives from all sides of the dispute for the
past 12 months.
A compromise solution or 'Common Position' was reached in December which
proved satisfactory to the software suppliers and the big computer
manufacturers, but left ECIS together with computer users across Europe
concerned about the legitimacy of reverse engineering for maintenance or to
facilitate the interconnection of one maker's computer with another.
These issues were addressed in a series of amendments which came before the
European parliament last week. Some 235 MEPs voted for the amendments, 89
voted against and 197 abstained. But under EC rules a minimum of 260 MEPs
have to vote in favour of an issue for it to pass.
The directive now goes back to Brussels for final ratification later this
year. Some nations - the Netherlands, Italy and Spain among them - are
expected to adopt the measures as they stand; France, Germany and the UK
will have to modify their existing copyright law.
The overall result is that the big manufacturers and the software suppliers
seem to have all they wanted; the smaller manufacturers are discontented but
prepared to live within the terms of the directive while users are confused
and angry.
What is now likely to happen is a series of court battles in each member
state as users squabble among themselves to define the exact interpretation
of the directive with regard to reverse engineering. There is still the
possibility that new proposals can be put to the Commission after the
effects of the directive have been assessed in practice. Perhaps the
commission's own drafting mechanism would benefit from a spot of reverse
engineering?

FT  23 APR 91 / Technology: At the sharp end of a supply chain - Dave Madden
explains how United Stationers has turned the distribution of its goods into
a fine art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVE MADDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Distribution is one of the duller business ghettos - dusty warehouses,
broken pallets and diesel oil. But the image, and the reality, are beginning
to change.
As Fiat shows off its robot-controlled inventory stacks in glossy
advertisements and IBM switches off the lights in its automated warehouse in
Greenock, it is clear that this Cinderella operation has a new set of
high-tech glad rags.
Britain's high street retailer Marks and Spencer has long appreciated that
sophisticated distribution processes are an important part of supply chain
management. They influence customer loyalty, product differentiation and
profit margins. According to Lee Iacocca, chairman of Chrysler: 'The company
with the best distribution systems and service level will win all the
marbles.'
In short, advanced logistics is no longer a luxury. One consequence of this
shift is the emergence of a new type of wholesale service company where
distribution is just as important as the product that is shipped.
Take paper clips. If you are an office products wholesaler, how do you get
retailers to buy such a simple, undifferentiated item from you, rather than
from any number of your competitors?
The answer, in the US at least, is 'value-added' distribution. United
Stationers, the country's biggest office products distributor, can sell and
ship a single pencil or one box of paper clips and still make a profit.
The same is true on all 25,000 items in its catalogue, from pens to filing
cabinets. And if a customer places an order by 6.00 pm it will be delivered
by 9.00 am the next morning to any location in the US.
Not surprisingly, this demands an extensive physical operation. United
Stationers, based near Chicago, sells products from around 400 manufacturers
to some 10,000 retailers across the US, via 14 regional distribution
centres.
This physical network is entirely dependent on a complex computing and
telecommunications infrastructure: Amdahl 5995 and IBM 3090 mainframes
supported by robotic storage devices from Storage Technology as well as
telephone and satellite communications networks. In all an incremental
investment of some Dollars 200m (Pounds 115m).
United's customers obtain information on the company's inventory via a
computer network which connects their machines to United's system of 1,400
PCs. This automates the ordering process and allows clients to see whether
United has a particular product in stock.
'Our customers enter upwards of 70 per cent of our orders for us,' says
Patrick Murray, IT vice president. 'We do it in lots of different ways. We
talk to everybody's computer. We do it in batch mode, we do it online -
however a customer requires it.'
Ultimately, Murray expects United's terminals to be on the desks of his
customers' customers too, and he intends to apply the same technology to
links with his own suppliers.
Ordering is only part of the value-added process. The sooner the retailer
knows that United has shipped goods, the sooner he can bill his customer and
collect his money, says Murray. Similarly United uses the system to get the
latest manufacturers' pricing information to these retailers, so that they
can manage their prices too.
Giving retailers such access to and control over the ordering and inventory
process, and the imperative to turn orders around in hours, has had serious
implications for United's warehousing operation.
Items are not stored in pre-defined areas. Rather, they are put in the next
available bin, as dictated by United's disparate product range: boxes of
pencils and desks do not take up the same shaped space. The warehouse map is
computer-controlled and the system tracks every individual batch of items.
Surprisingly, this random binning is not completely arbitrary. The system is
able to analyse the inventory and track 'hot' products - high moving items -
and guide them to where they are most accessible.
When a piece of inventory is manually put into store, staff use radio
frequency data entry terminals, complete with bar-coded reading guns, to
update the control system directly on line.
The logical extension of all this, says Murray, is to use similar tools and
the same bar code in the transportation and delivery process so that a
driver can verify that the right carton has been dropped at the right door,
and give proof of delivery. United hopes to introduce such an innovation
this year.
The same integrated technology feeds United's sales and marketing effort.
Its primary marketing tool is a catalogue of products, and United publishes
and distributes some 4m copies a year.
But because the catalogue becomes out of date almost immediately after it is
issued (with products being added or dropped), Murray has to provide regular
updates. He is hoping in the near future, however, to produce an electronic
catalogue, with colour pictures, dimension data and moving price
information.
At the hub of United's operation is a central IT development and operations
staff. Typically this is pared to the bone - 40 people to manage data and
voice communications, systems operations and a help desk (there is no
computer expertise in the regional centres). In addition, Murray has 100
staff in applications development and product introduction.
The effect of this technological commitment is two fold, Murray says. First,
United has grown significantly - it is now a Dollars 1bn company, and one of
just four national office products distributors in the US. Second, its
technology culture has enabled United to set pioneering service levels.
For example, Murray explains: 'We are doing lots of small orders. About 80
per cent of what we sell is not in the same packaging that it came to us in.
We don't sell a whole carton of paper - we'll sell one ream. Now the service
we provide for our reseller says you go out to each of your customers and
you take the orders the way they want them.
'You send the orders to us and we'll package them in such a way that they
can be delivered directly to the end user and you don't have to add labour.
When we put the label on the box the label says it came from you not from
us. Our dealer doesn't have to handle the merchandise at all. The most
profitable dealer is the guy who never sees the merchandise, absolutely
never sees it at all.'
The downside is that higher expectations become institutionalised. Because
United delivers anywhere in the US by the following day, and guarantees to
be in stock on all of its inventory, that has become the service norm.
Similarly United cannot afford to let up on its technical innovation. Murray
claims that the company currently has a lead of six to 12 months, but 'the
competition is pretty good at copying - so we better have the next thing
coming up to keep the gap open. To get the order we've got to be the easiest
company to do business with,' he says.

FT  23 APR 91 / Technology: Digital's load gets lighter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNTON MCLAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the price of computers has halved over the past five years, the cost
of distributing the finished product has continued to rise. Faced with the
need to sell twice as many computers just to maintain revenues, computer
companies have begun to focus on how they can reduce the cost of their
distribution systems.
Digital Equipment, with European sales of Dollars 5.2bn (Pounds 3bn) in
1989/90, has halved its distribution costs over the past five years. One way
it has done this is by cutting the computers in stock, down from 12 weeks'
supply to three and a half weeks.
Further ways of cutting the costs have been created at Digital's European
distribution centre in the Netherlands. Staff at the Utrecht centre no
longer carry order papers around the warehouse. Instead, the warehouse is
served by fork-lift trucks fitted with small keyboards, visual display units
and a miniature laser gun for reading barcodes.
The day starts with the driver signing on to the computer and taking note of
the first instruction of the day. This information consists of a string of
numbers which defines the precise location of the computer to be collected,
including the aisle, shelf and position of the computer in its box as well
as the order for the computers to be stacked, with the most robust equipment
at the bottom. When the driver approaches the box he confirms it is the
correct one by reading the barcode label on the side with the laser gun.
'The technique eliminates all possibilities for error,' says Co Berendsen,
manager of the Utrecht centre. An attempt by a driver to collect the wrong
box generates a warning signal and if he ignores this he will not receive
instructions for his next collection.
Berendsen says that the introduction of radio communications has cut the
time taken by the fork lift trucks to do the job by 40 per cent. 'Accuracy
has also increased and the trucks no longer do journeys around the warehouse
without a load.'

FT  23 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Tories to direct fire at Labour
over-spending: Local Elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY's expected announce-ment of the proposed replacement for the poll tax
will signal a Tory bid to fight the second half of the local election
campaign on their own terms - by directing attention at high-spending Labour
councils.
Foreshadowing the new phase of the campaign, Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party
chairman, yesterday launched a document giving examples of Labour
'mismanagement, inefficiency, failure and lunacy', such as the
non-collection of council rents, and high levels of debt per head.
'They don't collect the money owed to them, they fritter away funds on
pointless projects, and they obstruct competition for local services,' he
said.
Tomorrow's press conference - only the party's second of the campaign - will
see Mr Patten, together with Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment
secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, emphasise
the claim: 'Conservative councillors cost you less.'
The Tories' determination to put their poll tax troubles behind them was
underlined in a speech by Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, as he
called on the party to unite behind the prime minister and the party's
central beliefs.
'The Conservatives united are an almost unbeatable force; the Conservatives
disunited are not long off the opposition benches,' he said.
Labour, however, remains confident that the method of financing local
government will continue to be the main issue in the campaign, and that the
government's proposals are still vulnerable.
The opposition has changed its earlier tactics of attacking the new charge
as the 'son of poll tax'.
It has tacitly admitted that the new tax is different by publishing a range
of ministerial criticisms of a property tax, to indicate the likely extent
of disagreement among Tory MPs over the basis of the system.
'There is root and branch opposition to any form of property tax from the
top to the bottom of today's Tory party,' Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment
secretary said yesterday.
While Labour officials acknowledge that the party may not be able
convincingly to accuse the new charge of being a form of poll tax, they
believe it will still be attacked as unfair and too complex.
The opposition will point, in particular, to the way in which a banding
system will reduce the progressive nature of the tax, the use of capital
values alone to determine the band into which property falls and the fact
that the single-person discount is not linked to ability to pay.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, also cast doubt on
the trustworthiness of the amounts for projected bills under the new system,
claiming they were 'fairy-tale figures'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE market, that for silver, seems to have bucked the recession in the
antiques trade. London dealers were busy in New York at the weekend paying
extraordinary prices for silver and other ornate works of art.
SJ Phillips gave Dollars 159,500 (Pounds 92,544) for a Louis XIV silver
pitcher, made by Francois Guillou, which had belonged to Henry Ford II and
carried an estimate of just Dollars 25,000. The same dealer paid Dollars
330,000 (estimate Dollars 80,000) for an ornate French silver, gold, and
hardstone neo-Gothic clock set with emeralds, made in 1881.
Another London dealer, Partridge, secured for Dollars 66,000 an English
Victorian parcel gilt 'Gothic' ewer set with enamel and jewels, made in
Birmingham in 1855 by John Hardman. In 1983 it was sold for Dollars 5,000.
One of the rare private collections of pre-revolution French silver sold for
Dollars 2m at Christie's. All the 72 lots found buyers. The collection had
been assembled by the late Rodolphe and Williamina Meyer de Schauensee.
English furniture was less popular at Sotheby's, and a pair of George III
kingwood and satinwood parquetry collector's cabinets of about 1770 sold for
Dollars 88,000, below forecast.
At Christie's, however, there was a satisfactory price of Dollars 660,000
paid for a George III walnut and parcel gilt secretaire-bookcase made in the
mid-18th century.
Buying was selective in an auction of Chinese export porcelain and works of
art at Christie's in London yesterday. Two large 19th century hand scrolls
depicting battle scenes doubled their forecast, selling for Pounds 24,200 to
London dealer Sydney Moss. But an interesting punch bowl made in China in
the late 18th century was bought in at Pounds 7,000.

FT  23 APR 91 / Names allege that Lloyd's kept them 'in the dark'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of Names were kept 'in the dark' about the true state of loss-making
Lloyd's syndicates that they backed in the early 1980s, Mr Michael
Lyndon-Stanford, QC, alleged yesterday in the High Court in London.
Mr Lyndon-Stanford, representing 24 Names on syndicates managed by Oakeley
Vaughan Underwriting Agents, now in liquidation, was outlining why the Names
are taking action against the Corporation of Lloyd's.
Nine other Oakeley Vaughan Names are consenting to the action while 15 more
Oakeley Names are involved in supplemental actions.
The case, in which the Oakeley Vaughan Names allege that the Corporation of
Lloyd's was negligent in failing to supervise the Lloyd's insurance market,
was adjourned yesterday until Monday. The delay is necessary to allow the
judge, Mr Justice Gatehouse, to study extensive background documentation.
The 24 plaintiffs suffered gross losses of more than Pounds 5m as a result
of their membership of syndicates 168, 420/423, 551 and 862 in the 1980,
1981 and 1982 underwriting years.
Total losses by the 250 or so Names who were members of the syndicates
amounted to more than Pounds 30m.
The Names are seeking to prove that Lloyd's owes Names a duty of care, and
that in failing to supervise the Oakeley Vaughan agency properly, Lloyd's
was at least partially responsible for the loss.
Mr Lyndon-Stanford said that during 1980 and 1981 the authorities at Lloyd's
received information indicating that the Oakeley syndicates were guilty of
'overwriting' - accepting more premiums than allowed according to Lloyd's
rules - and also, along with Oakeley's sister broking company, breaching
other market regulations.
Following subsequent internal investigations, Lloyd's had taken disciplinary
measures against a number of insurers linked to the Oakeley Vaughan agency.
The Names say Lloyd's had not ensured that Names were informed of the
problems. 'Names therefore continued to back Oakeley Vaughan syndicates in
ignorance of its real position,' said Mr Lyndon-Stanford.

FT  23 APR 91 / Discrimination decline is seen in Ulster employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland's new fair-employment laws are beginning to reduce
religious discrimination in the workplace, Mr Bob Cooper, chairman of the
province's Fair Employment Commission, said yesterday.
Mr Cooper's comments followed publication of the commission's first broad
religious profile of the Ulster workforce, based on information from all
public and private-sector companies employing more than 25 workers. The data
cover almost 350,000 people - about two thirds of the province's workforce.
The breakdown showed that 61 per cent of those employed were Protestant and
33 per cent Roman Catholic. A further 6 per cent were described by the
commission as 'non-determined'. The commission estimates the total working
population to be about 62 per cent Protestant and 38 per cent Roman
Catholic.
Although the figures generally suggest the numbers of Roman Catholics in
jobs are almost in line with those available for work, the small percentage
variation has a significant difference on unemployment rates.
Male Roman Catholics remain twice as likely as Protestants to be unemployed
with under-representation and are particularly under-represented in senior
positions. Roman Catholics are also under-represented in the public sector,
where their they are reluctant to apply for jobs with the security forces.

FT  23 APR 91 / FT Law Report: British Gas employees to get inequality
compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOSTER AND OTHERS v BRITISH GAS PLC House of Lords (Lord Keith, Lord
Templeman, Lord Ackner and Lord Jauncey): April 18 1991
BRITISH GAS is a state controlled statutory body with special monopoly
powers for the provision of public services and accordingly, though it is a
commercial enterprise, its employees, like public sector employees, can rely
directly on the European Community equal treatment Directive when
complaining of a discriminatory retirement policy operating before UK
enactment of equality legislation.
The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by Mrs M Foster and five
other female employees of British Gas plc (formerly the British Gas
Corporation), from a Court of Appeal decision that they were not in a
position to seek compensation against British Gas for discrimination on
grounds of sex.
LORD TEMPLEMAN said that article 5 of the EC equal treatment Directive of
February 9 1976, provided that member states of the EC should apply the
principle of equal treatment to working conditions, so that 'men and women
shall be guaranteed the same conditions without discrimination on grounds of
sex'.
The UK took the view that the Directive did not render unlawful a rule that
men and women must retire at pensionable age, even if that meant that women
must retire at 60 whereas men need not retire before 65.
In Marshall (1986) QB 401 the European Court of Justice ruled that a general
policy of retiring women when they reached pensionable age at 60 and men
when they reached pensionable age at 65, was an infringement of the equal
treatment Directive.
The Court reiterated that a member state which had not adopted measures to
give effect to the Directive 'may not plead as against individuals, its own
failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails'.
It ruled that where a person involved in legal proceedings was able to rely
on a Directive as against the state, he might do so regardless of the
capacity in which the state was acting, whether employer or public
authority. It said, 'In either case it is necessary to prevent the state
from taking advantage of its own failure to comply with Community law.'
As a result of Marshall section 2 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1986, which
came into force on November 7 1987, rendered unlawful any discrimination by
any person against a woman in relation to retirement age, so that the
anomaly between employees in the public sector who could rely on the equal
treatment Directive, and employees in the private sector who could not, was
eliminated.
The position remained, however, that a woman in the public sector who was
discriminated against by retirement between February 9 1976 and November 7
1987, might be able to obtain compensation for breach of the Directive.
British Gas had a policy that women should retire at 60 and men at 65. It
infringed the Directive. The appellant employees were compulsorily retired
between December 27 1985 and July 22 1986. They claimed compensation for
unlawful discrimination.
The House of Lords referred to the European Court the question whether
British Gas was a body of such a type that the appellants were entitled to
rely directly on the Directive.
The Court gave its ruling on July 12 1990.
By paragraph 22 it said that article 5 (1) of the Directive might be relied
on in a claim for damages against 'a body whatever its legal form which has
been made responsible, pursuant to a measure adopted by the state, for
providing a public service under the control of the state and has for that
purpose special powers beyond those which result from the normal rules
applicable in relations between individuals'.
Accordingly, the question for the House was whether British Gas was such a
body.
By the 1972 Gas Act, replacing the 1965 Act and repealed by the 1986 Act,
the British Gas Corporation was established as a body corporate. The
secretary of state was authorised to make regulations with regard to the
appointment, tenure and vacation of office by Corporation members. Section 2
provided that it was the Corporation's duty to develop and maintain an
efficient and co-ordinated system of gas supply for Great Britain.
Thus British Gas was a body which was made responsible pursuant to a measure
adopted by the state, for providing a public service.
By section 4 the Corporation was directed to report to the minister, who was
authorised to give it appropriate directions for securing its efficient
management. By section 7 he was authorised to give it general directions as
to the exercise and performance of its functions in relation to matters
affecting national interest. By section 8 it was ordered to report annually
to the minister on the exercise and performance of its functions, policy and
programmes.
By section 29 of the 1972 Act, 'no person other than the Corporation shall .
. . supply gas to any premises except with the consent of the Corporation'.
That section conferred on British Gas 'special powers beyond those which
result from the normal duties applicable in relations between individuals'.
Accordingly, British Gas was a body which was made responsible pursuant to a
measure adopted by the state for providing a public service under the
control of the state and had, for that purpose, special powers beyond those
which resulted from the normal rules applicable in relations between
individuals.
British Gas could therefore not take advantage of the state's failure to
comply with the equal treatment Directive.
The appellants' complaints of unlawful discrimination were dismissed by the
industrial tribunal and the Court of Appeal on the ground that, for the
purposes of the Directive, British Gas was a private individual against whom
the Directive could not be enforced.
Before the European Court and before the House, British Gas repeated the
arguments which had found favour in the courts below. It submitted it was a
statutory corporation engaged in commercial activities; it did not perform
any of the traditional functions of the state; and it was not the agent of
the state. It argued that the European Court could not have intended to made
the Directive enforceable against a commercial concern.
Those submissions were irrelevant to the tests laid down in the Court's
ruling.
The sole question were whether British Gas, pursuant to a measure adopted by
the state, provided a public service under the control of the state, and
exercised special powers.
British Gas submitted that the secretary of state did not possess the
control contemplated by the Court because it had wide powers in the
performance of its functions. It submitted that monopoly in the supply of
gas was not a 'special power' contemplated by the Court, and that the Court
in its ruling had not clearly provided that nationalised industries carrying
out commercial functions were to be regarded as organs of the state.
The principle laid down by the European Court was that the state must not be
allowed to take advantage of its own failure to comply with EC law.
British Gas's policy was no doubt thought to be in its commercial interests.
The advantages of that policy would accrue indirectly to the state which
provided, through British Gas, a supply of gas for citizens generally and
was entitled to surplus revenue. If British Gas were allowed to escape the
consequences of an admitted breach of the Directive, the state would be
taking advantage of its own failure to comply with EC law.
In those circumstances there was no justification for a narrow or strained
construction of the Court's ruling.
Applying the words of the ruling, the 1972 Act created a body which provided
a public service to citizens generally under the control of the state, which
could dictate its policies and retain its surplus revenue. British Gas had a
special monopoly power created by the legislature. It was therefore a body
against which the Directive might be enforced.
The appeal was allowed. The proceedings were restored to the industrial
tribunal to assess compensation.
Their Lordships agreed.
For the appellant employees: James Goudie QC and John Cavanagh (Bruce Piper
&amp; Co).
For British Gas: Michael Beloff QC and Elizabeth Slade (CEH Twiss, British
Gas solicitor).

FT  23 APR 91 / Second bidder likely to pull out of ECGD sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SECOND company is likely to pull out of the bidding for the short-term
credit insurance business of the Export Credits Guarantee Department.
Management of Cobac, the private sector Belgian credit insurance company, is
to recommend to its board this week that it pulls out. The decision will
embarrass the government as it will weaken the field further, just as the
controversial privatisation legislation is scheduled to come before the
House of Lords.
Eagle Star was the first of the six shortlisted bidders to withdraw and
another, Sun Alliance, is still considering whether to submit a bid by the
April 30 deadline.
Mr Jason Hadick, Cobac managing director, said that the move reflected
doubts about the availability of re-insurance cover for credits to
politically risky developing countries. Whitehall policy on this meant that
British exporters 'would be at a structural disadvantage to their
competitors'.
He added he was 'extremely disappointed' by the move earlier this month by
Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, to overthrow an amendment to the
privatisation bill which would have required Whitehall to provide political
risk re-insurance cover for three years after the privatisation.
Without such cover from the government, the newly-privatised ECGD would
either have to charge very high premiums or sacrifice its rate of return, he
said.
Export credit bankers say they expect the bidding to end in a battle between
NCM, the Dutch credit insurer, and Trade Indemnity, which dominates the UK
domestic credit insurance market. They believe NCM has the edge at present,
although Italy's Assicurazioni Generali is understood to have made a
forceful sales pitch to ECGD management.
Cobac's move comes as major exporters, including Trafalgar House and GEC,
are mounting a fresh but discreet campaign to prevent what they see as a
concerted effort by the Treasury to withdraw government support for exports
to developing countries, including those sold under long-term credit.
The business of insuring such credits will remain a government
responsibility even after the privatisation of ECGD's short-term business.

FT  23 APR 91 / SIB may trigger investment industry shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHAKE-UP of investor-protection organisations and of investment
intermediaries may result from a review of investment-product retailing
initiated by the Securities and Investments Board, writes Barry Riley.
SIB, the chief investment watchdog, yesterday announced that it would work
with the Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers' Regulatory
Association (Fimbra), the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory
Organisation (Lautro) and other organisations to produce a formal
consultative document by the autumn.
The investigation of the working of existing rules - which split
intermediaries rigidly into independent financial advisers (IFAs) on the one
hand and company salesmen or tied agents on the other - has been triggered
partly by the mass switch by almost all leading banks and building societies
from independent to tied status within the past three years.
SIB has been disappointed by results of public opinion surveys that suggest
that the public does not understand or care about the differences between
IFAs and company salesmen.
Also, serious difficulties have been encountered by Fimbra, which oversees
IFAs.
Membership has been falling sharply, leading to financial problems that have
been worsened by the burden of the investors' compensation scheme.
SIB has already been requested by the Department of Trade and Industry to
investigate disclosure of commissions and other details to investors,
following a report by the Office of Fair Trading. IFAs complain that they
must disclose much more than company salesmen.
As part of its formal review of retail regulation, SIB is inviting
submissions from interested parties such as investors' representatives,
although it says it wants to discuss the overall framework rather than
address individual points of grievance.

PAKISTAN yesterday announced more steps in its programme of economic
liberalisation aimed at scrapping government controls and launching a drive
towards privatisation, Farhan Bokhari reports from Islamabad.
Mr Shujaat Hussain, industries minister, said foreign businessmen no longer
needed to seek permits to work in Pakistan. They would only need an ordinary
visa.
Mr Malik Naeem, commerce minister, announced a new export policy, with fresh
incentives for Pakistani businessmen. To boost exports, the government would
provide two-thirds of the cost of setting up new institutions for improving
workers' training, if business associations paid the rest.
A new export-import bank providing specialised help for Pakistani exporters
was announced. A marketing promotion programme would begin soon to train
trade attaches serving abroad.
Officials say the government intends to sell off at least one-third of
Pakistan's 150-strong public-sector units by the end of this year. The
exports drive is aimed at ending Pakistan's Dollars 2bn annual trade
deficit.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MILLIONS of Americans celebrated Earth Day yesterday amid concern about
political stalemate over environmental legislation.
Two controversial laws are due for renewal this year: the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, the federal law governing disposal and
management of hazardous wastes, and the Clean Air Act. Environmentalists say
the outlook for both is dim, thanks to lack of leadership by the White House
and in Congress.
Mr Jim Middaugh, spokesman for the Environmental Defence Fund, said bills to
renew and strengthen both acts were plagued more by regional disagreement
than by partisan differences. In the case of the waste disposal legislation,
those states with large tracts of surplus land were concerned about becoming
dumping sites for those with little free land and high populations.
No consensus has emerged about incineration methods. 'Do you incinerate or
do you prevent production?' Mr Middaugh said. 'Some want recycling, some
want wastes burned as fuels, some want that prohibited. Environmentalists
generally want to see a reduction in the process of materials that create
hazardous wastes.'
On the Clean Water Act, there are disputes between those who want to develop
stricter standards and those municipalities desperately in needs of federal
funds to meet current standards. Growth plans of some cities are being
limited by disputes over sewage treatment.
Little progress is also expected on energy conservation measures, despite a
study published by the National Academy of Sciences this month demanding
action to combat the 'greenhouse effect'.
The academy's recommendations included: tax incentives or regulation to
achieve a 30 per cent increase in car fuel efficiency; use of new
fluorescent bulbs to reduce the power used in lighting by 50 per cent; more
efficient motors to reduce industrial energy demand; tougher standards for
appliances; and a restructuring of energy prices to reflect their costs to
the environment.
The administration responded by restating its opposition to energy taxes and
to more stringent federal efficiency standards.

FT  23 APR 91 / Farm deal upsets Falklanders: Is the unloved FIC being paid
too much? John Barham reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the Falkland Islands government announced on April 6 that it planned to
buy out the last big absentee landowner left on the islands, it probably
expected the deal to be received as a triumph of local power over the
unloved Falkland Islands Company (FIC).
However, opposition to the sale quickly began to grow as purchase terms for
the four FIC farms emerged. Less than a week after the announcement, a straw
poll by the local radio station found that 36 of the 50 people questioned
rejected the deal.
The government has agreed to pay Pounds 4.85m for the farms, which cover
974,000 acres of prime land in the southern half of East Falkland. Other
payments raise the net price to Pounds 5m, or 13 per cent of government
revenues.
Most critics focus on the price FIC won for the farms. Mr Bill Luxton, a
councillor who bitterly opposes the acquisition, said: 'It's not the concept
that is wrong. I'm all for getting the land out of the hands of FIC.' But he
argues that the farms and their 200,000 sheep have been grossly overvalued,
claiming that the Falklands have handed Anglo United, FIC's troubled parent
company, a Pounds 3m 'donation'.
Mr Gerard Robson, one of the councillors who negotiated with Anglo, conceded
that 'with the present state of wool prices you can't argue that this is a
brilliant deal.'
The farms' only significant product is wool. Wool prices have crashed to a
50-year low and no farmer is making money. So the Falklands should have
received a discount from FIC instead of paying a premium.
However, FIC says it had another potential buyer who had offered as much as
Pounds 6m for the farms.
Officials admit that covering losses at the farms, which produced 29 per
cent of last year's wool output of 2,591 tonnes, will raise the acquisition
price to Pounds 8m over the next three years. Mr Derek Howatt, chief
financial officer, says the purchase may push the government into an
operating deficit this year.
Still, the legislative council is unlikely to reject the sale. Mr Robson,
like most councillors, says it is worth paying a premium to wrest control of
the islands' economy from FIC, which, established by royal charter in 1852,
wielded almost feudal powers in the Falklands until the 1970s.
Naturally, many people are questioning the wisdom of making the government a
big landowner at a time when state economic intervention is being rolled
back all over the world. However, Mr Ronald Sampson, the government chief
executive, says: 'We will take a very hard commercial line in running the
business. But we will not announce redundancies in the medium term. If (the
farms) have no long term future they will be allowed to go to the wall.'
The government can also be criticised for failing to loosen FIC's grip over
the islands' economy. Its shipping, retail and service operations remain
intact. These sectors are probably the most lucrative part of FIC's
operation.
Although Anglo United refused a government offer to buy FIC outright, it
decided to give the government 'for no consideration' a half-share in its
subsidiary Darwin Shipping. Darwin is a charter company that handles nearly
all the islands' foreign trade. By making the government a partner, FIC
probably expects it will be less anxious to break its oligopoly.
Strangely, the sale has highlighted the islanders' lack of self-confidence.
The Falklands remain very much a colony with appointed officials such as Mr
Sampson running local government. All big decisions must first be approved
in London, sometimes at cabinet level.
British officials say in private that the islanders often fail to grasp
complex issues, such as the land deal, fully. For their part, islanders fear
that the British government subordinates their interests to its own
political aims.
Conspiracy theorists suspect that obscure geopolitical or vested interests
were the 'real' reason behind the land sale. They say the government was
suspiciously quick to accept a sale that may not be in the islands' best
interests.
The Falklands have grown rich quickly through the sale of fishing licences.
This year licences will raise Pounds 23.7m for the treasury. The government
had earlier convinced the islanders to save as much of the windfall as
possible. But now it has agreed to a deal that will cost this year's budget
surplus.
Mr Ray Evans, a farmer, says: 'If they could only give a solid reason for
paying such a high price, it would calm a lot of people.'
But Mr Rodney Lee, once a farm hand and now the owner of a successful sheep
farm, summarises the islanders' dilemma: 'I've done a lot of bowing and
scraping in my time. We have been dictated to all our lives. All that ended
after the (1982 Argentine) invasion. But we don't have many local people who
are qualified to take complex decisions.'

THE US General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, has
begun an inquiry into the dozens of trips taken by Mr John Sununu, the White
House chief of staff, using military aircraft for what may have been
personal and political purposes.
The investigation was requested by Congressman John Conyers, chairman of the
House government operations committee. The Michigan Democrat lost no time in
pouncing on the opportunity to discredit Mr Sununu, who is heartily disliked
by many congressional Democrats.
An account of Mr Sununu's trips was given in the Sunday editions of the
Washington Post and US News and World Report magazine. The Post said Mr
Sununu had taken more than 60 trips in the past two years which included
visits to New Hampshire, his home state, and to Colorado ski resorts.
Mr Sununu reimbursed the government for the trips at the rate it would have
cost him to fly commercially. However, his use of military aircraft costs
thousands of dollars more.
On one trip, to Aspen, Colorado, he reimbursed the government Dollars 1,076
(Pounds 601). However, according to the Post, the cost to the Air Force was
more than Dollars 30,000.
Administration officials rushed to Mr Sununu's defence, portraying the use
of military aircraft as necessary so that the chief of staff could maintain
constant communications with the president.

<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S National Assembly yesterday rapidly finished revising the
constitution to end a state of war with China that has lasted for 43 years -
in the absence of opposition and independent delegates who walked out in
protest.
Chiang Kai-shek's nationalist Chinese government suspended the constitution
with additional emergency clauses, and declared a 'Period of Communist
Rebellion' just before it was driven to Taiwan by Mao's Communist forces in
1949.
The removal of the clauses allows President Lee Teng-hui to end the period
of 'Communist Rebellion' in early May and usher in a new era of
constitutional democracy for Taiwan.
Taipei hopes it also signals the start of a new relationship with the
communists in Peking, from whom it is expecting a positive response. Both
governments still staunchly claim sovereignty over all of China including
Taiwan, but a rapprochement of some sort has been forced upon them by
growing interchange between their peoples in recent years.
The opposition Democratic Progressive party and a number of other groups
oppose the National Assembly's adoption of a constitutional reform package
that allows the president to keep emergency powers.

   KUWAIT CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIGHTS may be on again in Kuwait City, but not, it seems, for the
fledgling opposition parties.
Their attempt yesterday to hold a press conference to comment on the
composition of the new government, just hours before the visit of Mr James
Baker, US secretary of state, left everyone literally in the dark as the
plug was pulled on the lighting system of the ballroom at the International
Hotel.
'Things are really going to get hot here now. We can already see what this
new government is going to be like,' said one opposition leader as his
colleagues, journalists, television crews, the hotel management - and the
wife of a US senator, dressed in medical garb - milled in confusion around
the ballroom. The seven main opposition groups had called their press
conference for 10am.
The management of the hotel then claimed that no booking had been made,
therefore no press conference could be held.
On to the scene came Mrs Cindy McCain, whose every second sentence reminded
the listener that her husband is Senator John McCain (Republican, Arizona).
Senator McCain's political career has, apparently, not been prospering of
late.
Mrs McCain was also due to give a press conference in the ballroom about the
work of her American Voluntary Medical Team, which she founded five years
ago and which explained her attire. Sadly for Mrs McCain, who travels with
her own television team, she failed to grasp the attention of the audience,
and, after a few minutes, offered to donate the rest of her allotted time to
the gentlemen from the opposition.
At this point, the hotel management had to come clean. There was not going
to be an opposition press conference in the hotel now, or perhaps at any
time. To emphasise the point, the ballroom was plunged into darkness.
Questions about the origin of the order met no response.
'It's obvious what is behind this,' said Dr Sami al-Katrash, an economist
from the University of Kuwait, carefully avoiding greater precision. Mr
Mohammed al-Kabiri, a former ambassador who in the last eight months had the
unusual distinction of being jailed in Kuwait by both his own government and
Iraq, was less cautious.
As the press conference informally reassembled in the open air, Mr al-Kabiri
said the newly constituted government was not representative of anyone. The
occupation and liberation of Kuwait had changed nothing, he asserted, except
that the opposition was now stronger and was determined to see the
introduction of democracy, especially freedom of speech.

FT  23 APR 91 / Hong Kong stumbles badly in its battle of wills with China:
Peking is out-manoeuvring colonial officials over the contentious issue of
who will control a proposed Pounds 7bn airport, reports John Elliott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG is losing on points in a tense diplomatic battle with China over
plans to build a HKDollars 100bn (Pounds 7bn) international airport, which
Peking is refusing to back until it has achieved extensive control over the
project.
The British colony is not prepared to concede such control before it returns
to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and it is threatening to shelve the project
indefinitely. This is creating uncertainty which is knocking business
confidence - yesterday the local stock market plummeted by 2.32 per cent,
the biggest fall since the start of the Gulf conflict last August.
Hong Kong's colonial government has also lost points recently to China on
three other occasions while trying to defend its constitutional rights.
The latest occurred yesterday when Mr Gordon Wu, a prominent construction
entrepreneur, was invited to Peking for talks on plans drawn up by a group
of Hong Kong Chinese property developers to take over the project and
finance it themselves for about HKDollars 60bn.
Mr Wu's ace card would be to suggest to China that he and the other
developers could build the airport rapidly after 1997 if Hong Kong refuses
to come to terms in the next few weeks. Infuriated Hong Kong government
officials see this as a spoiling tactic at a time when they are trying to
persuade China to come to terms.
Another loss on points came last week after Hong Kong refused to publicise
details of its options for the project, despite considerable local pressure.
Top Peking officials provocatively said that they were willing to publish
their ideas as soon as Hong Kong agreed, so that local people could judge
which alternative they prefer. This led to an outspoken debate in the
colony's Legislative Council last Wednesday when legislators turned on
Britain and Hong Kong, not China.
But perhaps most humiliating of all was a lecture read to Hong Kong
officials recently by China about fiscal discipline, control of public
borrowings, and maintenance of fiscal reserves. This was not a new line,
because China has been arguing that the airport project will drain reserves
and weaken the economy before 1997.
The humiliation arose because the Chinese, who are not themselves renowned
for strong fiscal discipline, read the lecture from Hong Kong's 1979 budget
speech delivered by Sir Philip Haddon-Cave, the then powerful financial
secretary. The inference was that, in order to build a massive British
memorial to over 150 years of colonial rule, Hong Kong's current top
officials had over-ridden the strict financial ethics on which the colony
had thrived.
China acknowledges a new airport is needed to replace existing congested
facilities. But it has been objecting to the plans since late 1989,
initially for a mixture of political and economic reasons. Now it is seeking
a continuing say on the project - for example the right to examine financial
borrowing and contract decisions - in addition to having seats on an airport
authority board. 'It wants control,' says a senior official.
Hong Kong says it is only prepared to consult China. It argues that any
further consensus-seeking measures would slow the project and establish a
precedent for China to gain virtual control of other medium- and long-term
economic and fiscal decisions before 1997.
Hong Kong's aim now is to persuade China that it is not bluffing when it
says that it would prefer to shelve (or effectively cancel) the project and
expand its existing Kai Tak airport. This refusal to give Peking a precedent
for control is backed by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, who
failed to reach agreement during a recent visit to Peking and who would have
to sanction any final breakdown with the Chinese.
The airport is now estimated to cost HKDollars 100bn at 1990 prices and is
the world's largest new infrastructure project apart from Gulf
reconstruction.
Officials had hoped the private sector would finance 40 to 60 per cent of
the HKDollars 127bn plans (at 1988 prices) originally announced in 1989,
which included linked port developments to be carried out later.
Recently it has emerged that the expected private sector element has dropped
to only about 25 per cent of the HKDollars 100bn - including bonds, loans,
equity stakes and franchises for parts of the airport.
But whatever the percentage, the government now believes that China's
support is essential. It fears China would attack the project if there were
no agreement and that this would scare off financial backers because
franchise periods and debt repayments would not start before 1997.
It might even deter six pre-qualified international construction consortia
which are now waiting to be invited to submit tenders for the Lantau Fixed
Link. Business confidence, on which Hong Kong depends, would slump.
Politics apart, Hong Kong could build the airport without the private
sector. It has HKDollars 75bn of basic fiscal reserves, plus an Exchange
Fund which has a secret amount of accumulated investment earnings, believed
to be about HKDollars 50bn-70bn (in addition to HKDollars 40bn needed to
prop up the currency and about HKDollars 60bn transferred temporarily as
investments from the fiscal reserves).
Most of the Exchange Fund earnings could be used for the airport, but the
government does not regard this as a viable option because it would be
strenuously opposed by China and, possibly, by Hong Kong people.
So the future of the project before 1997 depends on agreement with China.
This is a dramatic turnround from two years ago, when Hong Kong saw no need
even to consult Peking fully on the plans. As late as last year top
officials were saying they would go ahead on their own if China did not fall
into line, using public sources for the bulk of the funds.
Hong Kong is learning painfully about China's determination to protect its
inheritence over the final six years of British rule.

FT  23 APR 91 / Saddam seeks policy to partner brute force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAMIS ANDONI

<DATELINE>
   IRAQ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Iraqi government's decision to launch negotiations with Kurdish
opposition leaders is the latest sign that President Saddam Hussein is
attempting to remain in power by means of political flexibility as well as
brute force.
It might be going too far to suggest that President Saddam, who has just
deployed his security forces to crush Kurdish and Shia Moslem rebellions in
the north and south of the country, is in a conciliatory mood.
But the Ba'athist leadership, weakened by the allies' crushing victory over
the Iraqi army in Kuwait, is desperate to secure popular support by
implementing - or appearing to implement - a programme of liberalisation. It
is almost as if Mr Saddam has been studying recent events in the former
communist dictatorships of eastern Europe; he is trying to tinker with the
old system without allowing it to collapse.
Even those Iraqis who supported the government are now aware that three
decades of Ba'athist rule has suppressed rather than resolved the sectarian
and ethnic problems of Iraq. The appointment of Mr Saadoun Hammadi, a Shia
Moslem, to the post of prime minister (previously occupied by Mr Saddam) is
one of the most visible signs of the new mood in Baghdad.
For the first time someone other than the president has been allowed to
assume a high profile, with Mr Hammadi addressing the people and announcing
plans for political reform and economic liberalisation. Iraqis, however,
believe this is partly to deflect domestic and international attention from
the unprepossessing personality of Mr Saddam until the pressure eases. With
the president portrayed for the time being as a symbolic figure, any policy
disasters can be laid at the door of Mr Hammadi.
Iraqi newspapers, closely controlled by the state, are even allowed to
criticise Mr Hammadi and for the first time in recent memory cartoons of a
senior official have appeared in the newspapers. Al-Qadisiya, the Defence
Ministry newspaper, led the way with a half-page of satire in which
cartoonists reminded Mr Hammadi of the shortcomings of the system.
Ordinary Iraqis, even some Ba'athists, remain very sceptical about the
ability of the regime to change. Post-defeat calls for radical reform have
been replaced by a sense of helplessness and despair.
From the Kurdish north to the predominantly Shia Moslem south people feel
that they have no control over their own lives after the destruction of much
of their infrastructure by the allies and the crushing of the internal
uprisings across the country.
Those Kurds trickling back to their homes in Kirkuk and Suleimaniya do not
hide their sympathy for the opposition or their fear of the government.
Journalists who went on government-organised trips to the holy Shia cities
of Najaf and Kerbala in the south were confronted by the defiant stares of
local men and women. Damage in the south is much more serious than in the
Kurdish north.
Even in Baghdad there are indications that the army's suppression of the
rebellion has provoked militant feelings among Shia intellectuals.
The prospect of anarchy in a fragmented Iraq and the unconvincing political
performance of the multi-party Iraqi opposition has done something - in
Baghdad at least - to persuade people to give the government's much-heralded
reforms a chance to work.
Kurdish leaders themselves are reluctantly talking to the government despite
what they regard as previous betrayals, although they are insisting on
international guarantees for any autonomy plan accepted by the regime.
Many Iraqis, however, fear that President Saddam will backtrack as soon as
he feels that his grip on the country is secure.
He has pledged in a number of speeches that the process of reform is
irreversible, but Iraqis say he has a long way to go before they will take
him at his word.

FT  23 APR 91 / S Korea's industry giants pick their core businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF South Korea's largest chaebol, the highly diversified conglomerates
which dominate the country's economy, have selected the three subsidiaries
which they will develop as core businesses under a government plan to
increase industrial specialisation and international competitiveness.
In submissions to the Office of Bank Supervision and Exchange - the
government banking watchdog - which were released yesterday, all but six of
the conglomerates nominated their three 'core' business groups. The selected
subsidiaries will be freed from restrictions on bank lending which were
imposed on the chaebol in 1984 and which were aimed at limiting economic
concentration.
The six which have not yet selected core businesses have had the deadline
extended from last weekend until the end of this month.
The selections have raised concerns about overlapping investments and fierce
competition in several industrial sectors. Many of the chaebol have chosen
subsidiaries from the same industries for specialisation. Twelve of the 30
conglomerates, for example, have selected petrochemicals. Cars and
electronics were also common choices.
The new policy, which will be implemented from June 1, is intended to
increase specialisation among Korea's business giants by providing credit
incentives to concentrate on a smaller number of activities. The government
argues that more focused investment in technology and productivity is needed
to increase Korean competitiveness in international markets.
Chaebol subsidiary companies other than the three selected will see existing
credit controls tightened. The Ministry of Finance said the government was
deciding how to apply the squeeze.
While the chaebol oppose the existing policy of credit constraints, they
have strongly criticised the government's moves to make them specialise. A
statement by the Federation of Korean Industry, which represents the large
business groups, compared the new policy to a lottery.
Most industry observers believe it will be difficult for the government to
enforce the policy and, in particular,to prevent funds flowing from selected
group companies to other subsidiaries.
There were few surprises in the subsidiaries selected by the various
companies. Samsung Group, the largest of the conglomerates, which last year
recorded sales of Dollars 43.4bn (Pounds 24.2bn), selected Samsung
Electronics, Samsung Shipbuilding and Heavy Industries and Samsung General
Chemical as its core businesses.
Hyundai Group, the second biggest conglomerate, and Lucky Goldstar, the
third biggest, also selected petrochemicals as one of their choices. Daewoo
Group, the fourth largest chaebol, did not select Daewoo Motors, its 50-50
joint venture with General Motors of the US. But it did select Daewoo
Shipbuilding and Heavy machinery, which will soon start to manufacture
mini-cars.
As well as free access to bank credit, the companies chosen will have

HUNGARY yesterday attacked a Slovak plan to divert the Danube river,
accusing it of breaking international law, after talks about the
controversial hydro-electric project broke up in disagreement, writes
Nicholas Denton in Budapest.
Slovakia appeared determined to continue with the Bos-Nagymaros project,
despite Hungary's opposition. Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovakian Prime
Minister, even made a veiled threat to complete construction within
Slovakia's own territory, according to Hungarian officials.
'It would infringe the integrity of Hungarian territory,' an official said
of a Slovak scheme to divert the Danube.
Mr Meciar refused to rule it out as one way of circumventing Hungarian
opposition. 'Slovakia will not give up its intention to continue
construction,' he said. Digging a new channel was one of nine possibilities
being considered.
Hungarian public opinion is so concerned about the environmental
consequences of Bos-Nagymaros that the issue was at the centre of opposition
to the country's former Communist regime. Slovakia, on the other hand, has
done 90 per cent of the work on its side of the river.

THE enfant terrible of the French Socialist Party, Mr Jean-Pierre
Chevenement, who resigned earlier this year as defence minister in protest
against the Gulf war, is planning a come-back to national politics and shows
every sign of intending to live up to his reputation.
Yesterday he announced that he would be standing for parliament again, in a
by-election in his old Belfort constituency, which is being voluntarily
vacated by one of his loyal followers, Mrs Gilberte Marin-Moskovitz.
Under the French system, a politician who becomes a minister automatically
surrenders his parliamentary seat, and it is then filled by the next person
on his electoral list. Only the generosity of his successor, as in this
case, allows him a chance of recapturing it.
Despite Mr Chevenement's resistance to official policy during the Gulf
crisis, the Socialist party spokesman yesterday said that it would support
his campaign.

INDUSTRIAL production in Yugoslavia fell just over 23 per cent last month
compared with a year earlier.
Croatia, the independence-minded western republic, was hardest hit ; its
output fell by 29 per cent. The three-month figure for the predominantly
ethnic Albanian province of Kosovo was 31.2 per cent below that for the same
period last year.
The republics of Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia are all resisting the market
reforms proposed by Mr Ante Markovic, the prime minister. These reforms call
for the total overhaul of the country's financial and banking system and
introduction of a restrictive monetary policy. The programme aims to break
the hold over the economy of local political authorities.
Mr Markovic criticised the republics sharply last week for sabotaging his
plans and he appealed to the federal parliament to back the reforms in the
'transitional period' while the country's leaders sought a resolution to the
political crisis. He said Dollars 5bn-Dollars 6bn in loans from the
International Monetary Fund and western banks depended on the republics'
compliance with the programme.
Yugoslavia's foreign debt totals Dollars 16.1bn and its trade deficit is
more than Dollars 4.5bn.
In his address to parliament, Mr Markovic announced a 30 per cent
devaluation of the dinar. He also outlined plans for restructuring the
banking system and the privatisation of state enterprises which the
governments of the republics have brought to a standstill.
Mr Markovic this week faces a battle in parliament for the approval of his
economic reforms.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUNDAY'S Social Democrat victory in a key German state election, giving the
party control of the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, is certain to
strengthen the trend towards co-operation between government and opposition.
For the first since the process of German re-unification began it has also
placed a question-mark over the future of Chancellor Helmut Kohl himself.
Mr Kohl admitted yesterday that the loss of Rhineland-Palatinate, his home
state, was a 'bitter defeat' but said that his government could not duck
unpopular decisions. He added the Social Democrats would now enjoy 'a new
dimension of responsibility' but stressed there would be no strategy change
in Bonn and that he was not considering early retirement.
Mr Kohl, echoed by other leading members of the ruling Christian Democratic
party, did say, however, that the generation change at the top of the party
had to be speeded up. Mr Theo Waigel, head of the CDU's sister party, the
Christian Social Union, called the result a 'disaster'.
Mrs Anke Fuchs, SPD general secretary, said that Mr Kohl was politically
exhausted and had sunk to the level of unpopularity of 1989 before being
saved by German unity 'which he manipulated for electoral ends'.
However, despite the boost to the SPD, the party has still to find a
convincing leadership team, and as it gets drawn into accepting more
responsibility for national politics will find it more difficult to score
points at Bonn's expense. In national opinion polls the centre-right
coalition continues to comfortably lead the SPD.
In the Rhineland-Palatinate itself the SPD will negotiate first with the
liberal Free Democrats, also coalition partners in Bonn, but may following
Hesse and Lower Saxony with a 'red-green' coalition.
In Bonn the SPD will use its blocking power in the Bundesrat to stop the
coalition's plans to abolish two local taxes mainly levied on companies.

MR VLADIMIR MECIAR, Slovakia's controversial prime minister, could lose his
job after forming a break-away populist political movement.
His Public Against Violence (PAV) party and the Christian Democratic
Movement (CDM) are now negotiating to form a new coalition government in
Bratislava, the Slovak capital. Mr Jan Carnogursky, CDM's leader and
currently deputy prime minister, is widely favoured to succeed Mr Meciar.
Earlier this month, the volatile Mr Meciar antagonised his party's
leadership by forming a rival wing called PAV-Platform for Democratic
Slovakia. He also aroused suspicion in the federal capital, Prague, by
holding talks in Moscow with the Soviet military about resuming arms
production at workless Slovak weapons factories.
He is now expected to split formally with PAV at its congress later this
month and set up a new party. While Mr Meciar is mistrusted by leaders of
the PAV, whose ratings have plummeted in recent opinion polls, but is very
popular with ordinary Slovaks.
President Vaclav Havel has called for a referendum in the Slovak and Czech
Republics on the emotive issue of independence for the former. Parliament is
expected to adopt the proposal shortly and the referendum could be held this
summer.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (33): Reaching a far wider
audience - Object Oriented Programming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE computer industry throws up new jargon with monotonous regularity and
nowhere is this more true than in the software sector.
Software developers appear to adore arcane language and have produced a
succession of intriguing, high-sounding phrases to describe the artefacts
they create.
Non-procedural programming languages, life-cycle management, user-friendly
systems and relational databases are examples from the last decade.
The start of the 1990s has seen the arrival of another: object-oriented.
Its main virtue for the marketing department is its universality. It can be
applied to virtually every facet of software. In the last couple of years
databases, languages, design methods and systems architectures have all
become object-oriented.
However, behind the awkward American-English (it should, of course, be
object-orientated), there is a serious intent.
Object-oriented design suddenly achieved a higher level of legitimacy when,
last month, the important US software company Microsoft announced its
membership of the Object Management Group (OMG), an industry group founded
to promote object-oriented standards. IBM is expected to follow and OMG can
now boast all of the prime movers in software technology as its members.
OMG was founded in 1989 by a group of companies who wanted to push the
object-oriented approach into the limelight and supervise the creation of
common standards. Membership has tripled in the last year and now numbers
over 100.
Although OMG is primarily a technical body, it will exert a crucial
influence over the design of future computer systems. The concepts of
object-oriented design reach into the heart of information technology
systems and the OMG and its members will be responsible for laying the
foundations of the new order.
That IBM and Microsoft should suddenly make their interest public at this
time is no surprise. The commercial exploitation of object-oriented design
is just beginning, with bullish predictions for growth for tools which
conform to the emerging standards.
In a report sponsored by the OMG, Ovum, the UK researcher, forecasts a
European market worth Dollars 196m this year, rising to Dollars 1.6bn by
1996. The US market is expected to be even larger with total product
revenues of more than Dollars 2bn by 1996.
Ovum's analysis is based on growth in three areas: languages and tools,
developers' tools, databases and CASE tools. 'Object technology has emerged
from the early days of religious fervour and is experiencing rapid
acceptance,' says Ovum.
Although it is a new way of looking at computer systems, object-oriented
design has its roots in the past. The approach views computer systems as a
set of objects, which can be directly related to objects in the real world.
An invoice is an object; a manufactured product is an object and they are
both represented as such within an object-oriented computer system.
Object-oriented design evolved out of the same research at Xerox Palo Alto
Research Centre (PARC) which produced the windows-icon-mouse-pointer
interface popularised on the Apple Macintosh.
Similar interfaces, such as Microsoft's Windows 3, are also available for
IBM-compatible personal computers.
The Apple Macintosh and Microsoft's Windows 3 are both described as
object-oriented interfaces and, while this is true, the object-oriented
technology goes much further than a better user interface.
Object-oriented evangelists in the software industry talk of a paradigm
shift in thinking about how computer systems can be built.
Objet-oriented design includes several important ideas which help to clarify
systems design and make better use of existing technology.
The formal definition of object-oriented systems covers useful concepts such
as inheritance and code re-use. Inheritance allows different objects to
share the same characteristics. All invoices, for example must contain an
invoice date - a characteristic which is inherited by every object called an
invoice.
The re-use of code is of more pragmatic use and can be seen in some personal
computer software. A PC equipped with Microsoft Windows 3, for example, will
use the same display-screen driver program (the software which sorts out
text and graphics) in many different applications.
Language developers are in the frontline in object-oriented technology with
Microsoft and Borland both offering language compilers which are described
as object-oriented.
Database developments have been restricted to specialist suppliers such as
Objectivity and Ontologic. But both Oracle and Ingres among others are
reported to working on the technology and will deliver products later in the
1990s.
Suppliers of computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools, especially
those at the technical end of the market, have been at the forefront of the
technology with US companies such as Interactive Data Environments (IDE) and
Cadre Technologies leading the way.
More important, the OMG is well on the way to formulating the first of the
standards which will allow object-oriented systems to work across different
computer systems.
The OMG published its draft architectural specification last year and has
requested tenders for the technology which will form the core of a method to
control objects and the communications between them.
Later this year it is expected to publish a formal definition of what an
object is and this is likely to spur on the tool, language and database
providers to produce object-oriented products.
Object-oriented design promises to change computer systems design beyond
recognition in the next decade. One of the advantages of the approach is
that it opens the door to computing power - what was once called programming
 -to a much wider audience.
Although complex objects, such as invoice transactions, will still need
professional expertise, less crucial processes can be engineered by users
themselves.
They will be able to combine their objects with those that already exist
within a system and produce their own customised working environments.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (32): A story of niche
markets - Expert Systems, great expectations and disappointments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN recruitment expert Mr Nigel Schollick retires in 1995, the knowledge
gained in 30 years of interviewing and recruitment will keep working.
His judgments on skills and personality, from 'tactless' to 'shy on the
phone', will be delivered on people he will never meet, through the medium
of a software product called STARS II. It is an expert system which performs
preliminary interviewing and delivers some guideline judgments to the human
interviewer.
This is a typical example of what expert systems are supposed to do -
distill the expertise of individuals and deliver them in rule-based systems.
Five years ago, there were predictions that expert systems would be a good
area for software sales, comparable with spreadsheets in the 1980s. By
drawing on the advice of expert systems, not-so-expert people would be
enabled to perform skilled tasks with the minimum of training, a process
described as de-skilling.
In fact, the expectations have been largely disappointed: some of the most
vaunted expert systems pioneers have collapsed in the shake-out of the last
couple of years.
From the Japanese, who so publicly waved the banner of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) research as a platform for government investment, very
little has emerged. Expert systems are nevertheless the most visible of all
the AI techniques to have surfaced in commerce.
Expert systems have become the domain of a few small specialised companies,
working in niche markets, rather than a recognisable market sector. However,
they have penetrated various unrelated niche markets, not by presenting any
mystique-laden breakthrough, but by integrating with software that users
know and understand.
The story of the STARS product is typical of niche usage, because it uses an
expert front-end to accepted psychometric testing techniques. The system is
for use by in-house interviewers, and has been designed to help non-experts
(rather than personnel specialists) through the first tricky and
time-consuming steps of staff interviewing.
Mr Schollick, of European Personnel Counsellors based in Buckinghamshire,
has built his interviewing skills into STARS II. His expertise is packaged
in the wording of the questions, and in the expert rules which dictate which
questions the system asks.
STARS II chooses its own path through the labyrinth of up to 300 questions
per interview, selecting the questions in the light of the previous answers.
It delivers judgments from a possible 2,000 descriptions - along with
carefully-worded suggested questions to probe sensitive areas.
These help the human interviewer prepare for the face-to-face interview that
no computer can emulate or replace. STARS supplies a consistency of decision
making, and a short cut in assessing applicants.
This is typical of the niche approach. Expert systems seem to be winning
acceptance largely as an extension of other applications, and particularly
in industries which are comfortable with advanced technology.
The best known examples come from finance and industry. One Australian bank
uses an expert system to judge credit card applications. In the UK, ICI uses
the technique to assist paint analysis. The Financial Times Business
Information report on Successful Expert Systems, published in 1989, cited 20
large UK organisations using expert systems, including a few in mainstream
areas.
Mr Tim Johnson, director of London-based research company Ovum, points to
the commercial basis which is necessary to win wide acceptance of any AI
techniques.
'A lot of systems are for diagnostics - problem tracking of some sort, or
providing consultancy, everything in fact from diagnosing medical conditions
to finding errors in the production process for gas turbines. Another
interesting usage is as a front end to access text databases, to help find
the way through the maze of what information is available,' says Mr Johnson.
Ovum's report on the European market for expert systems, Knowledge Based
Systems: Markets, Suppliers and Products, puts the total for product
revenues in expert systems at Dollars 70m in 1990 with US revenues of
Dollars 128m: excluding expenditure on consultancy and customisation.
Mr Johnson notes that the UK, once a hotbed of development, no longer
provides Ovum with ready examples of advanced technology. In part, he blames
the dissolution of the UK Alvey programme, which funded a number of AI
research projects, although there are some signs of life in the AI
community, and Ovum is about to publish a new report on Natural Language,
the first update since 1985.
'Since Alvey declined, we've had to travel to France or the US to find the
latest technology, there seem to be fewer people in the UK to talk to. The
US in particular has progressed more rapidly because US companies were quick
to adapt when they realised that the early products of research were not
quite what people wanted,' he explains.
Neuron Data, the US company Ovum cites as having the largest share of the
expert systems market in Europe, has just opened a UK direct sales operation
in London, a sign of its confidence in the future.
Neuron Data sells Nexpert Object, an expert 'shell' which puts the emphasis
on integration. This means working with existing databases, on over 30
different platforms, including Macintosh, PCs, workstations, minis, and IBM
mainframes, and with different graphical user-interfaces for ease of use.
'Expert systems are just another software technology,' says Mr Richard Stow,
Neuron Data's UK sales and marketing manager who would like to distance
expert systems from the AI tag.
'To customers it's just one technology among many others. The old world of
AI - to which Neuron Data never subscribed - was about specialist hardware,
very complex software needing esoteric programing skills, systems with
guru-level intelligence which learn from experience - no mention of
integration or portability. The old world has gone: what predominates is now
a view of expert systems from the developer's perspective,' says Mr Stow.
He divides Neuron Data users into three categories; the end users, the
providers of packaged software, and systems integrators such as Andersen
Consulting. Among notable US Nexpert users are Manufacturers Hanover Trust,
which has built a system called Inspector, for monitoring fraudulent or
high-risk deals, and computer manufacturer Tandem, which uses online expert
diagnostics for its Integrity S2 system.
Mr Stow believes the UK market is probably 12-18 months behind the US in
terms of take-up of expert system technology, but it will catch up.
Andersen Consulting has about 25 users worldwide, including four UK sites
for its Expert Configurator which is built on to the MAC-PAC manufacturing
(MRP II) package on IBM AS400s. The expert front end allows the user to
match up a specific task needing certain machines with existing tasks and
schedules.
'We'd like to think that expert systems are becoming a mainstream
technology,' concludes Mr Stow. 'In the future you might see companies
amassing knowledge-bases - with PC networks and shared information, you
might even be able to put a value on knowledge as a corporate asset.'

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (31): Consultants come under
software attack - Case, engineering approach fails to match expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE adoption of traditional engineering principles has helped to improve
both the quality of computer software and the process which creates it.
Software developers have turned increasingly to the disciplines of
engineering to solve the problems which have plagued computer users since
the beginnings of the industry in the 1950s.
The engineering method, first adopted by the military and academic community
in the 1970s, is universally acknowledged - if not universally applied -
throughout the computer industry.
It has spawned a large and growing market for tools, consultancy and
re-training. It has caused businesses to re-evaluate their use of
information technology and promised to change the skill needs of the
industry. Software engineering makes labour-intensive program coding
obsolete and offers greater control over the design and maintenance of
software.
In spite of significant backing from industry leaders such as IBM and DEC,
the engineering approach has not delivered its expected promise. Its
supporters face new challenges. The shift away from proprietary, monolithic
systems to multi-vendor, networked systems makes it harder to build
information technology systems and has increased the pressure on software
engineers.
Mr Richard Barker, head of Oracle Software's software engineering
operations, says this is the biggest problem facing the software industry in
the 1990s. 'The problem of designing one logical program to run across
multiple hardware platforms will occupy the next few years,' he says.
The engineering approach will play a leading role in solving the problem.
Until quite recently, software production was haphazard and mysterious. Good
results were achieved by a mixture of luck and schooled intuition.
However, in the 1980s the engineering analogy grew in credibility and
software production was increasingly seen as a craft rather than an art. It
was subject to scientific laws and the design and production of a computer
program could be defined in the same way that an engineer specifies a bridge
or a motor car.
This change coincided with increased use of computers as design aids across
industry. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) - and the workstation technology it
inspired - could be applied equally well to software design and developers
quickly discovered how to apply it to their own products.
The results were lumped together under the umbrella name of computer-aided
software engineering (Case) and packaged up for a market, eager to find ways
to build better software at low cost.
Software pioneers such as Mr James Martin went as far as to say that the
application of formal engineering methods to business systems design not
only improved the quality of software, they could also give a business edge
in the market.
The vision is yet to be fulfilled. For every moderate success, there is
equal evidence of failure.
Consultant Butler Cox noted in a report, published at the end of the 1980s,
that Case tools only worked successfully, where a formal design method -
such as Mr Martin's information engineering - had been introduced. In other
words, the principles of systems engineering must precede the use of
software engineering tools.
However, there are other reasons for the apparent slow progress.
Mr John Lowrie, who worked with Mr Martin on Information Engineering
Facility and now leads Information Architechs, puts some of the blame on
consultants: 'The consulting world took over the whole concept of Case and
it resulted in complete culture shock in user computer departments. Case
changes the skill needs - de-skilling the programming back-end job and
re-skilling the front end analysis and design.
'It is a fundamental change and means that companies need a lot of change
management - an ideal market for consultants,' says Mr Lowrie.
He sees this attitude running against real advances in the software
technology: 'Consultants are not interested in producing the best software
technology - they just want to put in armies of consultants.'
A more compelling reason for the failures of software engineering is that
the technological goalposts have moved.
Early Case tools were conceived at a time when software was built for a
single machine and operating environment - usually a large IBM mainframe or
a DEC minicomputer.
The information technology systems of the 1990s will be based on networks of
PCs, clusters of database 'servers' and high-speed transaction processing
computers.
'The current tools were based on the software technology of 1983-84. We are
now moving into second-generation products based on late-1980s technology,'
says Mr Lowrie.
He is cautious about raising expectations too soon. 'I don't think anyone
really knows the answer yet - it is very early days. Our view is that we can
evolve into other environments because in Case you are maintaining designs
not machine code. But it is few years off.'
Information Architechs, launched in autumn 1990 as a spin-off from British
Gas, says its future developments in Case are aimed at multiple-platform
applications.
'We are attracted to the idea that future systems will be based on
client/server databases and local-area networks of personal computers,' says
Mr Lowrie.
Mr John Lewis, vice-chairman of IPSYS, UK software engineering company, is
cautious and points to IBM's problems with its Systems Application
Architecture (SAA) as an example of the difficulties.
'IBM announced SAA four years ago to provide a model for bringing its three
main hardware architectures together. But its hasn't brought out much of it
yet. At the same time it has its AIX/Unix developments, which lie outside
SAA,' says Mr Lewis.
He sees Unix playing an increased role in software engineering, as a
development environment and as a platform for applications. IPSYS is working
on Case tools to support Unix alongside proprietary environments.
'It is a question of economics. If you set up IBM's AD/Cycle you need an
expensive dedicated mainframe and PS/2 for every programmer. The cost is
between Pounds 3m and Pounds 4m. With Unix workstations you can set up an
equivalent system for about Pounds 1.5m and get far more power for your
money,' he says.
Oracle says it has plans to extend its Case products so they can produce
applications for multi-vendor networks. At the end of this month, Oracle
will announce a new generation of Case products which will allow designers
to specify the characteristics of the target environment and customise the
system.
This Oracle says, has implications for users. The company intends to include
more features which let the user extend the system and define new objects.
The company anticipates that within the next five years the distinction
between the development of a system and its live running will disappear.
This is a little optimistic. But there is no doubt that this is where
software engineering is heading.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (30): Systems that shed
fresh light on information - Geographic Information, 'the biggest step
forward since the map'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYND MORLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTER-based geographic information systems seem set to take their place
among those developments which will embody the information age.
They are described by the government as 'the biggest step forward in the
handling of geographic information since the invention of the map'.
The systems facilitate the display and manipulation of data among such
established users as the large utilities and national and local government -
organisations that have traditionally made extensive use of paper maps - and
are increasingly recognised as an accurate and effective marketing tool by a
variety of commercial organisations.
GIS, essentially systems which allow the analysis of stored information on a
geographic basis, consist of both graphic and alphanumeric data.
Automated mapping provides pictorial representation of maps and plans using
precise numerical information, while text-based data covering any number of
factors such as cabling, sewers, parks, schools, types of housing and so
forth are combined to facilitate analysis and planning.
The main benefits of their use, according to the Chorley Committee of
Enquiry set up by the Department of the Environment in 1987 to investigate
the handling of geographic information, include fast and easy access to
large volumes of data; the ability to analyse spatial characteristics of
data and to search for particular characteristics or features in a given
area; to link or merge one data set with another; and to produce flexible
forms of output such as maps, graphs and summary statistics tailored to meet
particular needs.
Mr Glenn Carver, a GIS consultant with information management company CMG,
comments that access to data and its proper management are important
elements in the successful use of GIS.
'A well managed GIS in a local authority could, for instance, hold all the
data for the various departments, updating and distributing information to
each department as changes were made. So, a map referenced by, say, a
postcode could be called up on screen, and depending on the information
required, be marked differently.
'Thus the housing department could ask for all empty council property to be
displayed, highways for all traffic light systems, and social services for
all registered child-minders,' he says.
Such systems, however, require an enormous effort of data input, and Mr
Carver notes that from the initial decision to develop a GIS, to final
implementation, normally takes between five and eight years.
'It is a massive undertaking, you certainly can't just dip your toe into
GIS. But we are talking about the complete integration of information within
an organisation. It is vital for users to think and plan strategically, and
it is part of our job to help them do so.'
The extent of the undertaking may have slowed the progress of GIS and until
recently confined its use to governments and utilities, but the technology
is being increasingly recognised as a powerful commercial tool, enabling
companies more tightly to target groups of people as potential customers for
specific projects and services.
Retailers, such as Gateway Stores have recognised how GIS can help support
decisions about store location, while sectors such as the oil industry look
to GIS to improve transport, distribution and work scheduling decisions.
A number of systems providers and consultants are active in the market in
this country, these include McDonnell Douglas, the leading aerospace company
whose information systems division recently announced its Spatial Modelling
System, which, according to Mr Barrie Laver, who is director of the
company's Applied Graphics Group, puts paid to the long-standing gripe of
academics that GIS is merely an adjunct to computer aided design.
'Spatial database systems are distinguished by their ability to link
graphics and text, thus creating smart graphics which provide a visual
window into the administrative database,' he says.
Pinpoint Analysis, another company active in geographic information systems,
provides demographic and geographic information which, the company claims,
when combined with clients' internal information will ensure more effective
targeting and delivery of products and services.
Pinpoint is among the leading suppliers of highly detailed digital address
and road data for use in GIS and has built up a wide range of databases
including a market-specific classification system geared to the financial
services market, and a profiling system which analyses UK neighbourhoods
into marketing-oriented categories.
In keeping with the increasingly high profile of personal computers,
Pinpoint offers Geopin, a geodemographic information system which runs on a
desktop computer and was developed specifically to meet the needs of
marketers.
Mr Martin Higgings, a GIS consultant with Pinpoint, explains that the system
was designed for users who are not computing experts, but who are
increasingly aware of the relevance of geographic information systems to
their business and so require the facility to perform complex analyses with
the help of simple pull-down menus.
The PC version of Geopin can be extended into a networked system and a
compatible mainframe version is also available.
The technology for GIS is well and truly in place, but it is the data needed
to make it work which, as well as requiring a considerable time effort, may
not always be easily available.
The Chorley report noted, for example, that 'information needs to be seen as
a corporate resource and be more widely shared between departments and
organisations', adding that 'the full potential of geographic information
systems will only be secured by co-ordinating the interests of the widely
dispersed community of users.'

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (29): The potential of
pictures - Multi-Media, tools to create  more informative systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of 12 computer hardware and software manufacturers has put its name
to a trademark.
This is not in itself so remarkable. The establishment of a trademark does
not require any great degree of commitment. However, the object of this
collection of companies is to establish a way forward for the personal
computer industry - and that future will encompass television pictures and
sound as well as the more conventional aspects of data processing. The name
for this is multimedia, and the trademark is MPC - Multimedia Personal
Computing.
Most computer systems are constrained to store and display information in
ways more acceptable to machinery than human beings. Text or numbers are the
norm, and, where pictorial information is kept, it is most often in a form
more akin to a cartoon or drawing than to a photograph. The storage of sound
for computerised manipulation is not any more advanced.
There are exceptions to this - a good example being the Domesday Project
machines, which use a BBC micro to access all sorts of geographical and
demographic data from a video disk, for display on a television screen.
However, in the mainstream of computing such applications are rare. One of
the leading suppliers is VideoLogic, a British company. It provides a board
which can go into an IBM-compatible PC or Macintosh. It can capture
television pictures and sound for editing and inclusion in a presentation
alongside other computer data.
Integration of video, audio and conventional data within a data processing
system is known as multi-media. A multi-media system should enable the user
to manipulate and view all such data. He could, for example, press a help
button, and not only view a manual but bring up an interactive tutorial,
where a film can be seen and heard of a teacher explaining a topic of
interest.
Such manipulation should be an integral part of the system's capabilities.
In a windowed environment, this would mean that the user would see the film
in a window alongside other data, and be able to drag it around the screen
or desktop or re-size it.
If such machines were readily available, it is easy to see what their
potential would be. Wherever pictorial information was needed it could be
invoked as easily as more normal text. For example, a travel agent could
store the whole of his catalogue of holidays, and then show a customer film
of a chosen spot, with appropriate sound track, as well as the normal
textual descriptions.
Sceptics might argue that all this is more appropriate to killing martians
on a screen and certainly the games or leisure market is where much of the
development of such systems has taken place. Multi-media enthusiasts,
though, such as Mr Bill Gates of Microsoft, believe that, by the end of the
1990s, it will be the norm, and that computer users will expect to be able
to deal in all forms of data, and interact with their machines in far more
sophisticated ways than they do now.
'Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is most readily enjoyed if it is delivered in
audio form,' says Mr Gates, in a piece on the subject published in
Encyclopaedia Britannica. He has a point.
One wonders in what other form it might be delivered, apart from a printed
score. Obviously, whilst the latter might be useful to a musician, it leaves
a lot to be desired to the layman. Merely to provide
conventionally-displayed computerised information can be just as limiting
because it does not provide the user with a form of data readily interpreted
by the most appropriate human senses for the information under review.
Multi-media promises to deliver information in the most appropriate fashion,
but with the same degree of control that you experience with any other
computerised data. A company might, for example, need a system to enable
them to look at geographical data. You could start by displaying a map. From
there, the user might select a town and look at a picture of the
architecture, or at a list of companies which have offices there, and then
at pictures of their products.
Those pictures could be revolved or walked around to enable the viewer to
see them from any angle.
They could be accompanied by a spoken sound track describing what is on
view. At each stage, the correct medium would be used to communicate the
information.
It would be easy to dismiss this as just another piece of enthusiastic
marketing, a product looking for a problem. However, that would be to ignore
the way other products have blossomed, and, if not changed the world,
certainly made an impact.
Spreadsheets, for example, were originally intended merely to provide a way
of doing cash flows, to take the pain out of re-calculating when information
changed, but that in itself could not account for their phenomenal success.
Users have driven that change, and spreadsheets are now embedded within the
corporate culture to such an extent that it is hard to imagine how we could
have managed without them.
The Multi-media PC will not be an end in itself, rather it will provide the
tools necessary to create more colourful and informative systems. Doubtless
it will provide the games player with an even more realistic view of his
imaginary worlds, but it could also bring the benefits of computing to a
wider business audience than hitherto. At least, that is what the gang of 12
are banking on.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (28): Advanced technology
lifts desktop publishing systems - DTP, new software products for a maturing
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INNOVATIVE software producers are giving a lift to the maturing market for
desktop publishing systems.
Publishers of larger magazines and newspapers may once have only considered
buying, say, a dedicated newspaper production system from one of the leading
suppliers, such as Atex or Systems Integrators (SII) of the US, or N. D.
Comtec, a division of Norsk Data of Norway.
However, publications across Europe and the US are produced on Apple
Macintosh's range, for example, using standard or enhanced software packages
from Quark (X-Press) or Aldus (PageMaker), which started life as suppliers
of desktop publishing software.
These advanced software products operate on the standard DTP 'platforms,'
such as IBM's PC, the Mac or other computers that can be bought 'off the
shelf' to produce a wide range of magazines and newspapers.
The Spanish newspaper, El Sol, in Madrid is just one example of a large
circulation daily paper produced on a Mac system, using software from Quark
X-Press.
'Many of the most innovative of these newspaper and magazine software
systems are produced in the UK - they achieve great results on what,
initially, were desktop platforms,' says Ms Laurel Brunner of Seybold, the
independent information resource group for publishing technology.*
Among these new UK software systems which operate on the Mac are those from
DPS Typecraft; Talbot of Bournemouth, and QED of Cheltenham.
Meanwhile, across the DTP industry, the Dollars 1.83bn European market is
the biggest in the world, and set to continue growing as technology has
brought 500 years of graphic communications techniques to the computer
industry.
Sales of Dollars 3.9bn are forecast by 1994 - by then, there will more than
97,000 new desktop publishing installations up-and-running in Europe, with
at least 18,000 of them located in this country, according to a report from
Frost and Sullivan, the leading market research group.**
But the rate of growth is likely to slow after 1992, as software and
scanning input devices take an increasing share of sales from hardware and
new DTP systems. While most DTP software programmes are English-based,
companies such as Apple and Adobe have tackled the language problem, with
increasing sales in non-English speaking countries.
Several leading Arabic newspapers and magazines are prepared in London on
Apple Mac systems using Diwan software. They include such daily broadsheet
newspapers as Sharq al-Awsat, Al-Hayat and Sawt al-Kuwait which are produced
in London and transmitted electronically to the Middle East for printing.
Because a large proportion of software comes from the US, many packages are
English-based, and the UK is - and will remain - the largest market in
Europe for DTP installations, with sales reaching Dollars 737m in 1994.
A typical DTP system includes a personal computer, a high resolution
monitor; a 'mouse' or other hand-controlled digitiser for positioning text
and graphics; plus software for word processing, graphics and
page-composition; and a laser printer. DTP systems, which may or may not be
networked, are generally at the low end of a larger market for electronic
publishing systems.
Colour continues to be a big topic in the DTP world - as systems move on
from basic monochrome to colour, the biggest issue is how users can achieve
colour-tone consistency across various computer screens, proof printers and
presses - a facility which is especially important to advertising agencies,
for example.
Innovation abounds in all areas of the market, with higher performance PCs
and new software packages. For example, the processing speed of Postscript,
the page-description language from Adobe, has been significantly enhanced in
the past year as somputer speeds have increased.
Vendors of proprietory hardware for professional publishing systems are also
'porting' software on to the Macintosh platform.
Apple has announced a new operating system, called System 7, which give a
new environment for many applications, particularly publishing.
One of these new enhancements is called 'Publish and Subscribe' which allows
users on a DTP network to call up 'live' material, such as text, artwork or
up-to-the-minute price lists.
In the European market for DT systems, analysts expect an upsurge in demand
in a number of application areas, particularly the production of magazines,
advertising literature and public consumption information. Scanning - and
particularly the input of higher definition with greater grey-scale and
colour - is expected to push up the cost of scanners and attendant software.
Sales of core hardware, personal computers and printers in Europe could be
worth almost Dollars 1.3bn by 1994.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (27): Some severe image
problems - Computer Leasing, collapse sparks an eventful year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STATISTICALLY speaking, 1990 was a dull year for the UK computer leasing
sector.
Figures released last month by the Equipment Leasing Association (ELA) show
a 4 per cent decline to Pounds 2.25bn in computer/office equipment leased by
its members, who represent more than 80 per cent of the UK leasing industry.
This is the first decline registered for at least eight years, although 1987
produced only minimal growth following exceptionally strong demand from the
financial services sector in the preceding year.
According to Mr Brian Hassell, ELA chairman, 'the decrease in 1990 reflected
the general slowing down in the economy.'
In all other respects, the last 12 months have been extraordinarily
eventful.
Starting last April with the British &amp; Commonwealth subsidiary Atlantic
Computers, a succession of independent equipment leasing companies have
collapsed or found themselves in serious difficulties.
With 1,800 employees at the time the administrators were called in, Atlantic
was once the world's third-largest computer leasing specialist.
Its customer list in 1983 included the UK Atomic Energy Authority, BAT
Industries, Hanson Trust, ICI and Penguin Books. Its 1988 turnover amounted
to Pounds 756.9m.
The most prominent of the subsequent casualties was Blackspur Leasing, the
specialist printing-press leasing company, and ICS, a diversified leasing
group whose turnover, at its peak, was approximately Pounds 70m.
In addition, the trading position of Capital Computers - another computer
leasing specialist - has deteriorated to such an extent since the end of
March 1990, according to the most recent directors' report filed at
Companies House, that it has been considering 'the sale of all or part of
its lease portfolio to third party companies and is also taking steps to
review its position in the leasing market place.'
While the increasingly recessionary business climate has undoubtedly been
partly to blame for the problems that companies have encountered, in certain
cases lax management and the questionable structure of the profferred leases
also played a role.
Atlantic pioneered an arrangement called the Flexlease which offerred
customers the ability to take advantage of advancing technology by upgrading
their computers yet which appeared - at least initially - to be extremely
attractively priced.
Unfortunately, the Flexlease concept also resulted in the accretion of
contingent liabilities due to the leasing company's commitment under certain
circumstances to make good its customer's payments over the final year or
years of the lease.
Not surprisingly, this year's collapses appear to have been the Flexlease's
death-knell.
According to Mr Geoff Sewell, director general of the European Computer
Leasing &amp; Trading Association (Eclat), 'it is very rare now that anyone
tends to look at the Flexlease, although most of the operating leases
written give customers the option of going back and renegotiating a new
deal.'
With the Department of Trade and Industry investigating Atlantic and the
fraud squad in at ICS, the collapses have also left the industry with a
severe image problem.
This can itself have serious knock-on effects.
One of the factors cited by Capital Computers for the deterioration in its
performance was 'the lack of confidence in the leasing market . . .
following the failure of the number of leasing companies trading in the UK.'
Perhaps the chief beneficiaries of the turmoil in the independent leasing
sector have been the computer manufacturers themselves, particularly IBM.
Ms Carolyn Jacks, director of Grosvenor Consultancy Services, the leasing
consultant, says the situation 'provided a marvellous opportunity for the
computer manufacturers to market their own lease offering as the safe
alternative.'
The annual European computer leasing survey commissioned by Solihull-based
Eclat underlined 'the increasing dominance of IBM's captive financing
subsidiaries.' More than 70 per cent of the survey's respondents ranked IBM
among the top three competitors in the industry, versus 16.2 per cent for
Comdisco, its nearest rival.
A year earlier, IBM had polled 54.9 per cent, versus 27.5 per cent for
Atlantic in second place.
The survey also claimed to reveal 'a rising trend of involvement by IBM' in
used equipment and buy-back transactions - a field traditionally dominated
by the independent leasing companies with their often painstakingly acquired
expertise in the market for second-hand computer equipment.
Though competition remains intense, the pressures being brought to bear on
the independents are now prompting expressions of mild concern from some
industry observers.
Mr Sewell says: 'Few people can specify five years ahead the equipment that
will meet their needs.
'The independent sector gives them the option of mixing and matching to meet
their technical requirements. Without them we would be back to the original
position at the end of the 1970s where the only alternatives available were
finance leases.'
Mr Sewell stresses, however, that 50-60 per cent of the installed computer
base is still leased through independent leasing companies.
According to Ms Jacks: 'For the manufacturers, leasing is a sales-aid method
which assists with marketing their new products - they cannot be expected to
provide their customers with the ability to change suppliers readily.'

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (26): Saboteurs are on the
loose - Networking, the art of knowing a Lan from a Wan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gordon Douglas is not a happy man. He manages user relations for the
European end of Netware Users International (NUI) the 80,000-strong user
group for Novell's Netware, the world's most popular networking software.
Local area networks (Lans) are on the up and up, and Netware is the code
that binds them together allowing dozens of people to share files and
peripherals such as printers. What concerns Mr Douglas is that software
saboteurs are on the loose, networks are their prime target and publishing
houses in Germany are printing their methods.
'They publish books that tell you how to plant a virus. You might as well
bring out a title on how to make an atom bomb in your living room,' says Mr
Douglas. His anger at the virus authors becomes understandable as he details
the precautions NUI and Novell have been forced to take.
'Virus attack has been the main issue in the last 12 months, and preventing
it is very expensive. A lot of leading companies do not allow employees to
use diskettes at all, so they can't unwittingly introduce a virus into a
network. The problem with networks is that they are meant to be open to many
users.'
Mr Douglas talks of protective shells, software that checks a program every
time it is entered on to the network to make sure the code has not changed.
NUI has pressured Novell to improve the security features written into
Netware. Since Netware is a computer operating system in its own right it is
not easy for the virus peddlars to get details of its workings.
Documentation is a closely guarded trade secret. But the interface between
Netware and the users' floppy disks became a focus for attention.
'Novell has now boosted protection for files entered through Netware. I
won't say exactly what they've done, NUI tested the new release by running a
virus specifically designed to attack MoveIl networks,' says Mr Douglas.
Metware's extra defences repelled the virus.
A successful virus attack can corrupt networked data across a company. 'They
can act in a nasty way. You find all your storage for the last year has
gone. Generally the motivation isn't for gain through blackmail, it's just
anarchy,' says Mr Douglas. His scorn for the unseen enemy is very real. The
other current passion the networking community admits to is economy.
'Security and money are the two big concerns at a typical user group
meeting. In the past, networking solutions had to be high-tech and
expensive. Now the emphasis is on cutting costs,' he adds. Mr Douglas reels
off the quick fixes users are resorting to. One site has found it can use
power lines as a medium for the local area network (Lan) rather than
co-axial cable.
If you don't mind the odd hiccup in non-essential data transmission this
makes some sense. 'It's daft but cheap]' is the Douglas verdict.
Mr Gary Dyson has been in a good position to observe the rise of the Lan. In
1985 he broke away from IBM with two colleagues and formed Persona Faculty.
The dual role company selling products (Persona) and training services
(Faculty) was started up to exploit networking.
In 1988, Dyson's Pounds 825 a day training courses attracted just 50 end
users. In 1990, 1,500 people signed up to get the most out of their
networks.
Two factors contributed to this growth says Mr Dyson. The political war over
the management of data, with corporate IT departments reluctant to see too
much power shipped down to the users, was resolved. The idea of a Lan of PC
workstations has been absorbed into the corporate computing model.
International standards have moved on, reconciling the IBM sponsored
Token-ring with Ethernet, a networking protocol with its roots in the
Digital Equipment world.
'The user shouldn't have to worry about choosing between them. They both
offer adequate performance, says Mr Dyson.' Faculty has ridden out the
collapse in hardware sales.
'In these times you can't sell hardware because companies have got enough.
But networking means they can turn their PC resources into a system. You
make the employees more productive. They cope better with fewer people,' he
says.
If the Lan is now an accepted standard, what are the big corporate buyers
doing to squeeze extra value out of it? As is usually the case in the
computer industry, any vaguely fresh idea is the cue for a crop of
buzzwords.
The Lan world has now spawned groupware. Referred to in the same breath as
joint authoring and discussion databases, groupware allows users to pool
documents across a network.
The secret of the software is to co-ordinate contributions without the user
being aware of this stage management. Although it is portrayed as structured
discussion it is probably better compared to the notorious bulletin boards
used to disseminate hackers' tips.
Lotus Notes is one of the pioneering groupware products. Price Waterhouse,
management consultants, use it to control activity on the international
front, when consultants work for a common client across national boundaries.
Ms Susan Challenger, an international marketing manager at Lotus, admits
that Notes may have fuelled the buzzword business.
'We're probably to blame, but groupware is a means to exploit network
software rather than just sticking a program on a network and sharing it,'
she says.
Lotus finds that network versions of popular programs now make up as much as
a third of its sales.
Ms Challenger confesses that the distinction between the Lan and its less
famous sister the wide area network (Wan) is not something to tax Lotus's
network development teams.
'When does a Lan become a Wan? I don't know. I prefer to think of everything
in Lan terms,' says Ms Challenger.
Perhaps a recent Dataquest survey offers the best explanation for the low
profile of Wans. European Lan spending is predicted to grow from Dollars
2.6bn in 1989 to Dollars 5bn by 1993. Over the same period Wan spending will
increase by a modest Dollars 100m, from Dollars 400m to Dollars 500m.
Interconnection between Lans is proving an attractive alternative to Wans
managed by expensive mainframes. And LANS are big in Japan.
The high cost of office space in Tokyo forces a rigorous assessment of every
square foot. Encouraging staff to share peripherals is one way of keeping
the rent in check, with a Lan saving precious space.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (25): Mix of cussed
independence and some mutual self interest - The User Groups, an
idiosyncrasy of the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVE MADDEN

<TEXT>
HEWLETT Packard has an invitation to show off its new Series 700 workstation
later this month at its user societies' annual general meeting.
However, this arrangement is not quite as cozy as it looks. Mr Steve
Chatterton, chairman of ADUS UK (the HP Apollo workstation user group) has
asked HP's main rivals IBM, DEC, Silicon Graphics and SUN, to bring their
their top workstations, and to compete in a demanding benchmark test devised
by ADUS.
HP is confident that it will not be embarrassed in its own backyard - on
paper the 700's specification is superior - but there is little doubt that
the move has ruffled HP's feathers, and it is taking the challenge seriously
 -to the extent that its worldwide workstation manager will attend.
This little drama illustrates the curious mix of cussed independence and
mutual self interest that characterises relations between user groups and
their suppliers.
The fact that user groups exist at all is testament to this ambivalence.
Fiercely protective of their separateness, yet loyal, and often genuinely
proud of their particular affiliation, in the same way that some people are
bound to their cars, user groups remain one of the idiosyncrasies of the
computer business.
At once ginger group, talking shop and social club, historically these
associations were the users' response to the technical complexities of
computing and the too often dictatorial tendencies of predominantly US-based
hardware vendors. They have developed over the last 20 years into sizeable
organisation in their own right: the IBM CUA has 1,500 members, and the DEC
group, DECUS, turns over Pounds 500,000 in the UK annually in spite of
administrative costs donated by DEC.
These national groups are invariably affiliated to larger pan-European or
international organisations or groups such as the National Computer Users
Forum (NCUF) the UK user groups' user group.
Does this complex network have anything other than a self-sustaining role?
In particular, when so many of the old loyalties and dependencies between
vendor and customer are threatened by open system environments, is their
much point in vendor specific user groups?
The short answer seems to be yes.
First, one of the primary functions of these groups is educational. 'They
act as a forum for sharing best practice. The IBM CUA serves as a
peer-to-peer information exchange both informally and through its extensive
seminar programmes. It helps us to avoid re-inventing the wheel,' says Mr
Michael Moore, CUA chairman.
DECUS's formal mission is similar exchange, both within the group, and
between the group and DEC, says Mr Steve Dawes, chairman.
As long as computing remains technically difficult, and in the short term at
least it can only get harder in a multi-vendor, open systems world, then the
user groups' basic role seems assured.
The same is true of their place as lobbyists.
This function is increasingly elevated to a formal consultative status. So,
for example, DECUS submits annual System Improvement Requests to the DEC
main board, a list of technology developments derived from polling
individual members worldwide.
At the same time, says Mr Dawes, the UK group is constantly plugging away at
local issues - anything from invoicing or licensing practice to an upgrade
path for companies using non-standard DEC hardware from the long-defunct
Systime.
Nonetheless the prospect of open environments is making its mark.
The fundamental challenge of open systems has prompted a basic restructuring
of the ICL CUA, says Mr David Stewart, its chairman.
The 35 erstwhile individual special interest groups under the CUA umbrella,
have set up a policy and review forum to consider, for the first time, their
common problems, and in particular to clarify a single voice in dealings
with ICL over open system and UNIX issues.
Mr Stewart argues that the users' voice generally has not been articulate
enough to influence open systems standards, and so far suppliers have
dominated the debate. He thinks that ICL will be delighted by the CUA's
initiative to define its own coherent set of priorities.
Similarly, Mr Moore and Mr Dawes report that open systems issues are
beginning to preoccupy their respective groups. Yet, paradoxically, they
also comment that IBM and DEC have never been more attentive in their
dealings with their users.
'IBM is relying more and more on user organisations,' says Mr Moore. Witness
the 50 senior IBM technical staff who attended the CUA's Common Europe
Conference in Brighton this month, just to listen to users, he comments.
So what is going on?
Could it be, the argument goes, that far from undermining these user groups,
open system, multi-vendor environments, could actually stimulate them?
User groups are persuaded that, as customers become more transient, then
suppliers will appreciate just how critical they are in marshalling customer
opinion, and ultimately, in keeping their loyalty.
Does this work out?
In part, perhaps. Certainly the days of user coercion are long gone. Mr
Richard Owen, HP's workstation marketing manager, who will have to face the
ADUS challenge, remarks that HP has long been a customer-led company. 'ADUS
is one place we can listen to them,' he says.
However, the rub, Mr Owen argues, is that whilst user groups are peopled by
technologists - MIS managers and systems administrators - then they will not
drive IT strategy, and in the long term, it is that, rather than the
practical consequences of open computing, that will marginalise them.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (24): Innovation under
scrutiny - R &amp; D, from technology push to market pull
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, International Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS the shock waves of fiercer competition and accelerating structural change
flow through world computer markets, debate is intensifying on both sides of
the Atlantic about the policy measures needed to stimulate faster innovation
in information technology industries.
The debate is broad because the nature of innovation and the ingredients
which contribute to it are hard to pin down precisely. Most studies identify
a wide range of contributing factors, including the macro-economic
environment, industry structure, education and training, management culture
and capital markets.
Most of these elements, however, respond to policy changes only over the
longer term. Hence the search for faster-acting remedies has frequently
focused on deepening the technology base by stepping up investment in
research and development and encouraging research collaboration between
companies and universities.
Since the early 1980s, subsidised joint research programmes such as Esprit
have constituted the main thrust of European Community efforts to enhance
the competitiveness of its electronics industry. In the US, there has been a
growth of industry consortia such as Sematech, the MCC and the SRC.
The trend has been inspired partly by the mounting costs of staying at the
forefront of electronic technologies and partly by the widespread belief
that government-orchestrated collaboration has played a decisive role in the
rise of Japan's electronics industry.
So far, industry performance has not perceptibly improved. Many larger US
computer makers, including IBM, are suffering a severe profit squeeze, while
in Europe the industry is fighting for survival as heavy losses at companies
including Philips, Nixdorf and Bull have prompted drastic retrenchment and
restructuring.
Why has the industry failed to respond? One explanation was given in a
recent paper by Dr Brian Oakley, former head of the Alvey programme, a
five-year electronics industry research project launched by the UK
government in the mid-1980s.
He says that though Alvey achieved its technical goals, few of the
participating companies turned the resulting research into successful
products. That suggests that the weak link in the innovation chain is not a
shortage of good technology but companies' failure to exploit it
commercially.
A broadly similar conclusion is supported by a number of recent studies of
government-sponsored industry collaboration in Japan. These suggest that
government schemes played only a minor role, and that the Japanese
industry's strength owes much more to the stimulus of fierce competition on
its home market and to the structure and organisation of individual
companies.
In successful Japanese electronics manufacturers, research and development
are much more tightly integrated with production and marketing than in
western industry. A team approach ensures the rapid feedback of information
between all concerned - including suppliers and sub-contractors - at every
stage of the process.
Unlike western companies, which have traditionally viewed innovation as a
sequence of separate leaps forward, in Japan it is a continuous process
achieved by simultaneous incremental advances across a broad front.
Typically, Japanese manufacturers have many more, smaller development
projects under way at once than do their western counterparts.
The benefits of the Japanese system include shorter product development
cycles and greater flexibility in responding rapidly to market changes.
Furthermore, by spreading their development effort across so many different
projects, Japanese companies are less vulnerable to the consequences of
individual product failures.
Stung by Japanese competition, many western technology companies are seeking
to speed up innovation by attacking barriers between research, product
development and manufacturing. IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Philips and
Daimler-Benz have all recently taken steps to strip away layers of
bureaucracy which slow down their response time.
However, turning technology into manufactured products efficiently is only
one aspect of the challenge facing the computer industry. Indeed, as even
Japanese suppliers are discovering, it is no more than a necessary condition
for staying in the race.
As technology becomes ever more mobile, component prices continue to fall
and product lives grow shorter, many types of computer hardware are becoming
low-margin commodities. That trend - which is being accelerated by the
spread of open systems standards - is compelling manufacturers to seek more
of their value-added downstream by competing on functions, services and
software.
As this process gathers momentum, the driving force behind the computer
industry's development is shifting from technology push to market pull.
Increasingly, innovation is stimulated by the way in which computer power is
applied, rather than by the specifications of the equipment used to deliver
it.
That has placed more influence in the hands of users, particularly larger
ones, and is obliging suppliers to tailor information systems ever more
closely to the organisation and specific requirements of individual
customers.
A number of western manufacturers, such as IBM and ICL, have responded to
that trend by directing more of their marketing effort into alliances with
partners which possess intimate knowledge of specific industry sectors.
Japanese computer companies are starting to realise that they can no longer
rely simply on technical and manufacturing excellence to sustain their
growth. Fujitsu's recent acquisition of ICL was heavily influenced by the
Japanese company's desire to improve its access to European markets and to
benefit from the British company's expertise in systems integration.
Over the longer term, this is likely to mean that computer manufacturers'
competitive performance will depend critically on the sophistication and
quality of demand in their main markets. Furthermore, as information
technology becomes more pervasive and deeply-embedded, the economic benefits
it confers will be found increasingly in its application, rather than its
production.
However, the heavy preoccupation among western policy makers with technology
as the main competitive battlefield suggests that they have still to absorb
the full implications of these trends. If their efforts to strengthen the
performance of the computer industry are to bear fruit, they will almost
certainly need to widen their focus beyond the supply side and place more
weight on measures to stimulate vigorous demand.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (23): Moore's law passes the
test of time - Memory Devices, a prime driving force in computer
developments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prime driving force behind the panoply of developments in computing has
been the ever-increasing availability of memory. It is considered quite
normal for a portable computer to have more main memory and on-line disk
storage than could have been crammed into a mainframe system 15 or 20 years
ago.
A significant element in such developments has been the fundamental law of
semiconductor manufacturing first postulated by Mr Gordon Moore, chairman of
Intel. This states that the number of transistors which can be designed into
a given circuit area doubles every 18 months.
This law has held true since Intel developed the first semiconductor memory
in the late 1960s. This held just 1,024 binary bits, roughly equivalent to
20 words of text. In the intervening 20 years, the capacity of a
conventional Dynamic Random Access Memory (Dram) has risen to 4 Mbits, the
equivalent of about 77,000 words of text.
The next big step, to Drams holding 16 Mbits, will take that figure to about
300,000 words per chip.
The availability of this capability to store programs and data has created a
large demand for it, which in turn has led to a continual stream of new
players entering the market and, in their turn, dominating it.
At the start it was US manufacturers such as Intel, National Semiconductor,
Mostek and Motorola. However, in a highly competitive market with high
demand, and with other product lines such as microprocessors to service,
they were soon overtaken by other companies that specialised in memory
production.
These were the Japanese suppliers that still dominate the semiconductor
memory business, such as Hitachi, NEC and Fujitsu. It is they that have
taken the lead, not only in memory product, but also in research and
development in the area. Few US companies now bother making memory chips at
all.
Because of the nature of semiconductor manufacture, where the investment
required to make devices of this capacity is large whether 1m or 2m are
produced, the volume production skills and benevolent investment climate of
Japan was always likely to make those companies significant in the market.
Similar circumstances are leading manufacturers in other Asia Pacific
countries to target the Japanese suppliers.
Well-known names from Singaporean, Tiawanese and Korean consumer
electronics, such as Samsung, Goldstar, Daewoo and Hyundai, are established
as suppliers of leading edge devices that rival the dominant Japanese for
capacity, quality, quantity and price.
There is a certain irony in this last factor, for they are proving to be
highly price competitive at a time when their presence is creating the
potential of an over-supply of components.
This same sequence of events brought the Japanese suppliers to prominence in
the first place when their aggressive pricing on world markets pushed most
US semiconductor manufacturers out of the memory business and prompted the
imposition of trade tariffs and sanctions by the US.
The fact that Moore's Law continues to hold true means that it is perfectly
possible to predict the future capacity of memory devices, and when they
might appear. Not only brute capacity will feature, for by the turn of the
century it is confidently predicted that a wide range of special purpose
memory devices will have appeared.
For example, the turn of the century should see a technology capable of
producing 512 Mbit memory chips but there is, according to companies such as
Fujitsu, a more important market in using some of that potential capacity to
produce other functionality on the same chip.
It could be possible, for example, to provide logic circuitry on a 256 Mbit
chip that will allow the memory to be customised to suit the requirements of
a specific application.
Fujitsu suggest it would be possible to include several current state of the
art 32-bit processors in just one corner of such a memory chip, with other
logic such as analog to digital converters - important for turning
real-world measurements into a form which can be handled by a digital
computer - also squeezed on to the same device.
Such a memory could have wide-ranging applications in industry, engineering
and commerce, simply because it would be re-programmable.
Another area which is expected to see rapid developments is the Flash Eprom,
a type of Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory which offers high capacity,
non-volatility and a fast re-write capability.
What this means in practice is that companies such as Intel, which is a
leader in this particular technology, can produce memory cards the size of a
credit-card for portable computers and other space/size critical
applications that can be written to with applications and data, stored
safely without the need to be electrically refreshed, be read from as often
as needed, and be erased and over-written as required.
In all but two important areas, price and capacity, this is an excellent
semiconductor analogy of the magnetic hard disk system. Even the most
enthusiastic semiconductor suppliers do not see the technology, which boasts
1Mbyte memory cards, taking over from the hard disk in the near or
medium-term future as the prime vehicle for on-line data storage.
For shear on-line, available data storage capacity, the magnetic disk is
still waiting to be beaten. It is also unbeaten on the classic measure of
price per megabyte of storage.
The manufacturers show no signs of giving up such advantages without a
fight. Conner Peripherals, the leading US purveyor of small disk systems,
has helped to open up the burgeoning notebook PC market by producing systems
using disks just 2.5 inches in diameter, yet capable of storing more than 20
Mbytes of data.
At the other extreme, high capacity 5.25 inch disks are being cascaded
together in desk-side PC systems from the likes of Dell and Compaq to
provide over 1 Gigabyte of capacity - more than many a mainframe system.
The long-standing role of magnetic tape as the medium for storing archive
data is under threat. Variations on the CD-ROM, based on established Compact
Disk Technology, are providing much higher capacities in a safer and more
usable form. In addition, they are starting to prove an excellent delivery
vehicle for comprehensive published data, such as directory information.
Most important of all, they open up new markets for companies to publish
vital product information such as documentation. Using multi-media systems,
such information can be shown in many new forms, including speech, videos
and animations, as well as the old standby of text.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (22): Testing the water for
entry to mainstream - Imaging and Scanning, an immature technology grows up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE technology for scanning documents is most commonly seen in the
ubiquitous fax machine. It is not complex: a scanner detects the presence of
shaded dots on the page and then converts this information into an easily
manipulated stream of ones and zeros.
In spite of the relative simplicity of the technology, document scanners for
reading this information into computers are still rare.
Scanners have, for the most part, been eschewed as an immature technology
although the big banks have long used scanners for automatically reading
cheques and simple forms, and supermarkets and manufacturers have bar-code
readers to identify products.
For at least 10 years, market forecasters have been predicting an explosive
growth in the use of scanning and its related applications, most notably
document image processing (DIP).
So far, almost all the projections have proved to be optimistic, many of
them wildly so, but there are at last signs that DIP is about to enter the
mainstream and that market growth rates are accelerating. As a result, all
the big computer and office equipment suppliers are introducing products and
investing heavily in research and development.
There are several reasons why image processing has remained a niche
activity.
The specialist equipment can be expensive; in addition to the scanners for
reading documents or other items, a user must have software to manage the
information, terminals with big clear screens for displaying the images, and
powerful computers and high capacity disks for holding large amounts of
information.
Software for converting the scanned image into character-based text (optical
character recognition) and for managing the movement of images (usually
known as workflow) has only recently reached a point where it is widely
available, reliable and cost-effective.
Most of the products available have not been developed with specific
applications in mind. This means that potential users must customise their
systems and develop their own application specific software. Inevitably,
this has limited the market.
'The problem is that vendors have been selling the technology as a
technology, not as a solution to a business problem,' says Mr David Kelly,
document management systems marketing manager for computer supplier NCR.
Users often end up developing simple, sometimes ineffective systems: 'If you
look at the applications, they are not very sophisticated, nor as widespread
as the technology will allow,' he says.
Image systems have been developed separately from other business
applications. The big banks and insurance companies which have invested in
DIP systems have all struggled with the issue of how to integrate their
image applications with their traditional business applications.
The technical problems of putting effective image systems together have been
compounded by a simple one of scale: a normal A4 page of wordprocessor text
takes up about 1 kilobyte of computer memory or disk space, but a scanned A4
page can take up as much as 30K to 80K of memory (depending on complexity).
Such large volumes of information can quickly fill up magnetic disks and
clog up communications networks.
Each of these obstacles is now being tackled and to a large extent overcome.
The cost of raw computer power has fallen rapidly over 10 years, while
optical disk technology has solved the storage problem: each compact disk
can store thousands of scanned images.
Compression techniques, high-speed local area networks and high band width
communication lines have solved the document distribution problem and now
make it feasible for scanned images to be distributed across large
companies.
Scanners have improved and fallen in price, with the Japanese taking a
growing market share. At the top end, specialist scanners for reading
cheques can read up to 400,000 documents a day, some reading both sides.
Full colour scanners, although still expensive, are also finding their way
into some desk top publishing applications.
The biggest market for document scanners is at the low end, where quality is
improving and costs are falling. Kurzweil, a leading supplier, has a system
in the Pounds 15,000 bracket which can read up to 50 pages a minute at a
high-quality 400 dots-per-inch resolution.
Hand-held scanners for attaching to personal computers are available for a
few hundred pounds. Last year, an international group called the Scanner
Programmers Interface Association announced they were developing
international standards to make it far easier to use scanners with simple
office software programs.
Until now, fax machines, photocopiers and computer-attached scanners have
been separate devices serving separate purposes. But some suppliers believe
that eventually the use of 'scan servers' will become widespread: documents
will be scanned once and automatically indexed, after which any user on an
office network can make copies, distribute them electronically, or
manipulate them on-screen.
Xerox, developer of the photocopier and the inventor of the windows
graphical user interfaces used by Apple and others, is leading the way. It
announced in October 1990 that in the US the Xerox Docutech Production
Publisher 'will ignite a revolution as profound as the introduction of the
first plain paper copier in 1959'. The system can be used to scan colour
images from paper, manipulate them on-screen using 'cut and paste'
techniques, and print up to 135 high quality copies a minute. But it is not
cheap: an initial configuration costs in the region of Dollars 220,000.
The most impressive examples of document image processing in use can be seen
in the financial sector, where the big paper-bound institutions have
developed corporate-sized systems. Norwich Union, for example, recently
revealed its new mainframe-based insurance claims handling system, based on
IBM's Imageplus system. Eventually, it intends to deliver document images to
as many 10,000 terminals throughout the organisation.
The benefits of image processing can be seen at Royal Life, part of the
Royal Insurance Group. It installed an Olivetti Filenet document image
processing system in late 1989 to store copies of its pension plan
documents. It has spent a bout Pounds 500,000 on the computer hardware and
about Pounds 300,000 on software.
The Filenet system is being used to hold about 180,000 executive pension
plan documents which have been scanned in and are then stored on video disks
which can hold up to 40,000 A4 pages. The Filenet scanner is theoretically
capable of scanning 40,000 A4 pages a day; Royal Life uses it to process
3,000 a day (it is not an automatic process; each document needs to be
scanned, checked and indexed in a process which takes about 20 minutes per
page).
Before the system was installed, the paper files were kept in vast archives.
Existing policies took several days to retrieve manually and new policies
took between eight and 30 days to process. Financial intermediaries
frequently complained about the long delays.
Now, new policies can be processed within 24 hours, while checking on
existing policies is immediate. 'We can get any A4 page off the system in
between two and 17 1/2 seconds,' says Mr Alex Littlejohn, Royal Life's
customer service manager.
The fastest growth in demand for image processing applications is being seen
at companies such as Royal Life, where there is a serious paper storage and
management problem which is affecting business efficiency. According to
market researchers Ovum, the price of a typical multi-user DIP system will
fall from Pounds 750,000 to Pounds 400,000 over the next four years,
attracting thousands of new customers.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (21): Computer virus is the
biggest threat to companies - Security, or confidentiality, integrity and
availability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN computer systems were monolithic machines in air-cooled offices, locked
away from most of the employees, the security of the data was relatively
easy to guarantee. But the pervasiveness of personal computing and computer
networking now means that almost every employee in many large companies has
access to the main computer. Ensuring the data is not maliciously altered or
misappropriated is therefore increasingly difficult to achieve.
Most organisations are beginning to realise the importance of sound security
measures. According to accountants Price Waterhouse, security accounts for 9
per cent of expenditure on new computer systems, up from 5 per cent, five
years ago. Today only 5 per cent of companies spend nothing on it compared
to 25 per cent in the mid-1980s.
One difficulty for commercial organisations is that there is no single
source of risk: instead companies have to secure what is known as the 'CIA'
of computer data:
'Confidentiality' - so that only those who are authorised to see or alter
the information can do so.
'Integrity' - to ensure the information is not changed.
'Availability' - to guarantee the computer is operating correctly when
required.
One of the biggest threats to companies is the computer virus, says Mr Peter
Jenner, business manager of PA Consulting's security consultancy centre. In
the UK, both Rolls-Royce and British Rail, for example, have experienced
viruses this year.
Viruses, computer codes which replicate themselves from one computer to
another and destroy the integrity of the data, come in a wide variety of
forms, many with exotic names. With the 'cascade' virus, for example, all
the characters fall from the top of the screen into a pile at the bottom.
While with the 'Italian' virus a ping-pong ball bounces across the computer
screen.
Virus checking software is available from companies such as Sophos, of
Abingdon, SS International, of Berkhamsted, and International Data Security,
of London. It works by checking for the individual pattern that every virus
leaves in the program.
However, virus developers see the increasing sophistication of anti-virus
software as a challenge to develop ever more complex viruses, says Mr Chris
Frost, senior manager in the European data security division of Price
Waterhouse, making it increasingly difficult to spot the interloper. The
latest stealth viruses change their identification code every time the
program is loaded - so the detection system cannot look for a specific
string of code.
Other viruses are armoured to prevent detection. When they latch on to a
program they encrypt it entirely, making it difficult for the scanning
software to detect where the virus code begins and ends. Other viruses have
even been developed that remove themselves altogether from the program when
the detection software is run.
As often as not, viruses are introduced into a company by an employee
bringing in his or her own floppy disk to play computer games at lunchtime.
Far more sinister is the hacker who breaks into the computer system by
imitating the sign-on procedure of a company employee - by using his or her
computer password.
The biggest problem with computer passwords is that employees often do not
take them seriously - they are likely to use the name of their spouse,
children or pet dog as the password, all of which can be easily guessed by
the would-be hacker. Or they use series of easily guessed numbers, or even
the word 'password' itself.
To overcome this the latest software packages contain lists of unacceptable
passwords - up to 20,000 words of them in some cases. More secure means of
preventing unauthorised access to computer systems are on the market or
under development. One is biometric devices, such as retina scanners,
thumbprint recognition machines and sign-on machines where users have to
sign their name.
While somebody can change their password into a computer system easily
enough, it is impossible to change a thumb print, or a retina, but this can
bring drawbacks. Once a hacker has taken a thumbprint, for example, they can
gain access to the computer system repeatedly without anyone noticing.
More complex are combinations of hardware and software. Dynamic password
tokens, for example, use devices about the size of a credit card which
produce a new numeric password every few seconds. This change is controlled
by an algorithm, or mathematical formula, which is synchronised with the
mainframe's software. To use the system the user types in a name and
password, and then types in the password that is displayed at that moment on
the token.
Once a hacker gets into a computer system the results can be horrendous. The
widespread use of computer systems in financial applications - payroll,
funds transfer or bill payment - has offered organised crime a lucrative
opportunity for replacing the security van robbery with split-second
electronic fraud.
Most frauds are discovered by regular checks, but expert computer systems
are helping to minimise the cost of these. In the case of a bank, for
example, the expert system would be programmed to know that a Pounds 1,000
transaction at an exclusive clothes shop would probably be genuine, whereas
a transaction of the same amount from the local supermarket would not.
There is a growing awareness among computer companies that their operating
systems software must be made more difficult to crack. ICL, for example, now
offers a high-security version of its VME operating system for commercial
use which incorporates mandatory controls: files cannot be moved from one
section of the computer to another - from accounts, say, to manufacturing.
Such security measures have also been adopted for the Unix operating system,
with the latest version of Posix - which interfaces between Unix and the
applications software - having the capability to create these mandatory
controls.
Last but not least, computer manufacturers and consultants are selling their
wares as disaster recovery companies. Back-up sites and mobile computer
units are there to ensure that even if your computer room is flooded or
struck by lightning, your business is not destroyed as well.

COMPUTER workstations are 'not just for 'techies' anymore', Sun
Microsystems, market leader, has declared.
These high performance desktop computers have until recently been aimed
primarily at engineering and scientific applications. Sun and others see a
new market opportunity for workstations as high-powered business computers.
'The mass penetration of workstations into markets dominated by personal
computers, minicomputers and mainframes isn't a future event - it has
already happened,' Sun claims.
The marriage of computer workstation performance with the vast software base
of the PC is luring dozens of computer makers and software developers into
this emerging market. PC companies such as Compaq Computer and Apple
Computer are planning to build more powerful desktop machines based upon
Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessors borrowed from the
engineering workstation world.
Workstation manufacturers such as Sun, Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard
are targeting business users as well as their traditional engineering and
scientific markets. The technical features and market characteristics that
divide the PC and workstation markets are fast disappearing.
Business applications are increasingly being ported to varieties of the Unix
operating system which is widely used on engineering workstations. The raw
data processing power of the PC vies with that of low end workstations.
Distribution patterns are also overlapping.
Traditionally, workstations have been sold primarily by direct sales forces
or through value-added resellers who add specialised software. Increasingly,
however, workstations are being offered by the computer dealers and retail
outlets that dominate the PC market. However, as workstations enter the
business market a conflict between PC and workstation software standards has
arisen.
While Microsoft's DOS operating system dominates the PC world, Unix - in
various forms - is the operating system of choice for workstations. Backers
of the Advanced Computindustry consortium of 21 companies, have declared
their support for both a future unified version of Unix and a future version
of Microsoft's OS/2 operating system.
Members of the group acknowledge that they are hedging their bets, until it
becomes clearer which way the business workstation market will move. The
emergence of workstations as business computers has added to the fierce
competition in all sectors of the Dollars 7.5bn workstation market.
Sales of workstations are expected to total Dollars 9.2bn this year and
reach over Dollars 12bn in 1992, according to Dataquest, the market research
company. Sun Microsystems is the clear winner in workstations, with a
dominant 32 per cent market share.
Sun's combination of the Sparc Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC)
microprocessor and SunOS version of Unix has attracted several licensed
cloners who offer Sun-compatible computers.
Sun's strategy has been to establish Sparc as an industry standard and
mostly through the success of its own products it is succeeding. Industry
analysts predict that Sun will continue to lead the workstation market
throughout the early 1990s although International Business Machines may
aggressively challenge Sun.
'By 1992-93 Sun and IBM may tie for first place among workstation vendors,'
predicts Ms Vicki Brown of International Data.
IBM has made a remarkable resurgence in the workstation market since its
introduction, a year ago, of a range of products based upon its own RISC
design.
The company sold Dollars 1bn-worth of its RS/6000 workstations in 1990 and
gained a 6.6 per cent share in the market. Sales are expected to rise to
Dollars 1.7bn-Dollars 2bn this year.
Hewlett-Packard, the number two workstation vendor, lost market share in
1990 but is expected to make a strong recovery this year with the recent
introduction of a new product range.
Using an enhanced version of the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC)
architecture upon which its minicomputers are based, HP has taken a
technological leapfrog to produce machines that greatly outperform
comparably priced workstations from its main competitors.
HP's new top of the range Series 700 Model 730 workstation is twice as fast
as IBM's fastest workstation, and 3.5 times the performance of Sun
Microsystems Sparcstation 3, HP claims.
Digital Equipment saw its share of the workstation market reduced in 1990 to
17 per cent from 23 per cent in the previous year, according to IDC.
Digital is aggressively supporting Ace, the Advanced Computing Environment
initiative, and plans to upgrade its DEC station product line with new
workstations based upon the powerful R4000 Mips computer RISC chip, when
that device becomes available.
'Marketing prowess and execution - not pure technology - will ultimately
determine the winners in the workstation market,' predicts Ms Brown of IDC.
A challenge for all workstation participants will be to maintain profit
margins as average workstation prices fall and to adjust to new distribution
channels as the market for workstations expands.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (19): 'Let the industry do
what it does best' - Reverse Engineering, conflict and compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE

REVERSE engineering, the practice of unravelling a competitor's product to
learn how it works in order either to emulate it or to attach proprietary
equipment, achieved unlikely political notoriety last year after a European
Commission draft directive designed to protect software makers unleashed one
of the fiercest bouts of lobbying ever witnessed in Brussels or Strasbourg.
The purpose of the draft directive was both simple and honourable; to
protect the creators and suppliers of personal computer software who are
being cheated annually of about Pounds 3bn in Europe through unauthorised
copying of their products.
The idea was to eliminate existing disparities between the copyright
protection systems for software in the member states as part of the
Commission's general plans for the harmonisation of EC law for 1992.
As such, it was supported to the hilt by organisations such as the Business
Software Alliance, the Software Publishers Association, and the Federation
Against Software Theft.
The Business Software Alliance, established by six of the world's leading PC
software suppliers - Aldus (desk top publishing) Ashton Tate (database)
Autodesk (computer aided draughting) Lotus (spreadsheets) Microsoft
(operating systems) and Wordperfect (word processing), has taken a leading
role in initiating legal proceedings against companies it believes guilty of
software theft.
However, what turned a commonsense measure designed to protect software
companies in a uniform manner across Europe into a political hot potato was
the fine detail in the draft. Computer manufacturers realised quickly that
the provisions of the directive would specifically forbid unauthorised
reverse engineering and in doing so, hamper their efforts to compete with
the leaders of the industry such as International Business Machines (IBM)
and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).
A campaign led by the hastily formed European Committee for Interoperable
Systems (ECIS), to persuade members of the European parliament and the
Commission to modify the directive was immediately initiated.
The software suppliers, together with IBM and DEC who saw the opportunity
legally to forbid Japanese manufacturers access to their technology, took
the opposite line and for some months the two lobbies fought a fierce war of
words.
It was not surprising that the Commission's draftsmen failed to anticipate
the scale of the row they were to precipitate. Reverse engineering, while
simple in concept is complex in detail and the extent to which it is used is
essential. Furthermore, its use in the computer industry is rarely
appreciated by outsiders.
It is an easy concept to understand in conventional engineering. Automobile
manufacturers routinely take their competitor's vehicles apart to see what
makes them tick. So what is reverse engineering in computer software?
It is software archaeology, according to Mr Gilles Lafue, a software
specialist with Andersen Consulting. 'It consists of extracting the
software's functionality (what the software does) and the design (how it
does it) by analysing the software's implementation - that is, programming
code, data structures, files and databases.'
It is necessary because of the dominant position of a small number of
manufacturers who are able to set de facto standards for data processing
systems. That means essentially IBM and DEC. Other manufacturers must so
design their equipment that it can be connected to IBM's or DEC's if they
are to have a share of the data processing cake. To do so, they have to
understand the design of the connection, or interface, in great detail.
That knowledge can be acquired either directly from IBM or DEC - leaving the
competitor at the mercy of the industry leaders - or it can obtained by
reverse engineering with or without their permission.
Of course, reverse engineering can be used to create a competitive product
through copying or improving on the original which is why software makers
are keen to have it banned. Many of the best software innovations are not
patented but simply hidden away in thousands of lines of computer code to
prevent copying; legal reverse engineering, the software specialists
complain, would be tantamount to a plagiarist's charter.
It was not simply hardware manufacturers and software houses who were upset.
Europe's computer users realised their ability to carry out essential
maintenance on their software would be hindered by the directive.
(Maintenance, in the software business, means modifying and extending
existing programs rather than repair.)
A compromise position was reached in December last year when a version of
the directive was agreed in Brussels which provided for:
Classification of software as literary works
A definition of originality
A common term of protection in accordance with the Berne Convention
Legal reverse engineering in limited circumstances.
These circumstances are when the retrieval of information is confined to the
parts of the original program necessary for inter-operability, when the
information retrieved is not communicated to third parties except to the
extent necessary for the operation of the new program and the information
retrieved is not used to create or market a program that infringes a
copyright in the original program.
The compromise proved broadly satisfactory to the hardware manufacturers and
to the software suppliers. However, the issue has continued to spark
controversy.
Earlier this month, the European parliament's committee on Legal Affairs and
Citizen's Rights proposed 11 amendments to the draft directive which clarify
the scope of the directive for research and analysis and the status of
interfaces between hardware and software under copyright law.
It has resulted in a new round of lobbying with ECIS in the forefront of a
campaign to persuade MEPs to vote in favour of most of the amendments.
Meanwhile, the Business Software Alliance which represents over 800
publishers of PC software, has decided it is time to call a halt.
In an open letter to the legal affair committee earlier in the year it said:
'After over a year of extended lobbying, it was finally possible last
December to reach a compromise that virtually the whole computer industry
could accept. We believe that it is now time to include all of the lobbying
and political debate and let the industry get back to what it does best -
producing hardware and software - under the terms of this compromise'.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (18): Software takes the
driving seat - Mid-Range Systems, hardware architectures under review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE undeniable driving force in much of the mid-range systems market is
systems software, and in particular Unix and the broader issues of open
systems. These, in turn, are changing some of the rules that govern
mid-range hardware architectures.
Unix is insinuating its way into a position of dominance in the mid-range
market, and the leading manufacturers are all reacting to it. Some, such as
Digital Equipment (DEC), have arguably come to it somewhat later than
others, while IBM is at last showing some signs that is taking the subject
seriously.
The operating system is starting to have an impact on the way mid-range
systems are designed and built. Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) chip
sets are increasingly the order of the day, for example, and those systems
manufacturers that do not have their own designs are signing supply and
technology licensing agreements with those that do.
DEC is committed to the RISC chips produced by MIPS Computer, so much so
that it holds a minority stake in the company. The MIPS-based DEC Station
systems are still largely at the low-end of the company's product range, but
MIPS has a new, more powerful 64-bit processor on the drawing board, which
is likely to form the basis of any successor to DEC's successful VAX
minicomputer architecture.
These chips lie at the heart of the new consortium of leading hardware and
software companies, known both as the 'Gibraltar Group' and the Advanced
Computing Environment (ACE) group, which is aiming to build a new industry
standard for both the lower reaches of mid-range systems and workstations.
Most estimates suggest that the first new machines built to this standard
will not appear for three years.
Evidence to bear this out comes indirectly from DEC, which is pressurising
its existing VAX users into updating their applications code to take
advantage of future RISC systems within three years, otherwise they will be
effectively locked out of future open systems developments. The company
plans to shift to RISC-based systems and away from the VAX architecture in
the long term.
Prime targets for the ACE group are Sun Microsystems, which claims to own
about 60 per cent of the workstation and low-end mid-range market place, and
a newly reinvigorated IBM, which has scored some significant recent
successes with its own RISC-based machines, the RS/6000 range.
Sun Microsystems is fast becoming an important player in the mid-range
market, not only for its own systems but also for its SPARC RISC-chip set,
which is being aggressively marketed to other systems vendors. Several names
in the mid-range market, with UK's ICL leading the way, have signed up to
use the SPARC chip set and have established their own systems in the market
place. The chip set offers systems builders a scalable platform, allowing
them to develop machines that range from 12 mips (million instructions per
second) workstations to 100 mips superminicomputers, all running the same
operating system and applications software.
Stretching from the desktop workstation through to large corporate server
systems, the IBM RS/6000 has ruffled some feathers among established Unix
mid-range suppliers by winning an order for 2,500 systems from Barclays
Bank. This cuts across the standard industry perception that IBM only pays
lip-service to Unix, and even then takes an alternative stance by having its
own version of the system, a extensively re-engineered superset of the Unix
standard called AIX.
From the company's early efforts in the RISC-based workstation and mid-range
markets with the 6150, which were generally considered to be down on
performance and up on price in comparison with the competition, the
completely re-worked RS/6000 series looks like making a success of itself.
This, in turn, may prompt IBM to take an even more positive stance about it,
rather than always managing to give the impression that it is something of
an afterthought to other, more strategic product families.
In this context, the company's main mid-range offering is the AS/400 family.
Though by most other manufacturer's standards it would be considered a large
success, sales of these machines have generally been considered as somewhat
disappointing. It has largely been seen as the replacement for the company's
old System 3/X line of minicomputers which have a good, if stolid reputation
in the traditional small and medium-sized business market.
System 3X replacement sales have been good for the AS/400, but its
penetration into new markets, especially those dominated by DEC with its VAX
systems, has not been excessive.
The machine has been plagued recently with technical problems, particularly
in the area of disk storage. It has been found that disk drives for the
machine are suffering from excessive vibration which causes disk crashes and
consequent failure of the system. What has made this worse is the fact that
the system software is spread across all drives used on an AS/400, which
means they all must work for the system to work.
AS/400 users are subject to the changing pricing policies that can come with
such proprietary systems. Recent changes in IBM's software pricing for this
machine have left users that upgrade their existing systems facing a 50 per
cent jump in software costs for enhanced code that had previously been free.
One growing trend in the mid-range market is towards multiprocessor systems
built around common devices such as the Intel i486 processor. One of the
leading contenders, Sequent, has systems available using as many as 18 of
these devices, offering a capability of servicing up to 500 users.
NCR has recently announced systems using a similar architecture which, like
the Sequent system, runs Unix. Once again, the basis of the trend is towards
scale in both the hardware architecture and the applications software to
give mid-range users maximum flexibility.
Such systems go some way towards meeting the growing need for fault
tolerance by the simple expedient of using a lot of processors. This is only
a partial solution, however, and rarely satisfies those users with
business-critical applications that demand the maximum in reliability.
That market place remains the domain of two main contenders, Stratus
Computers and, the market leader, Tandem. The latter's Integrity S2 machines
use multiple processors, but instead of tasks being shared out among a
number of small units, these use large processors to run the applications
together, monitoring each other's output and voting between them to discover
and isolate faults.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (17): Right-size gains
credence - Mainframes, life in the old system yet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE mainframe computer will it not lie down and die. It continues to
demonstrate it has a viable, long-term place in information processing and
management, in spite of the inevitable effects of the recession, and the
continuing suggestion that it is to be supplanted by a collective of
mid-range, workstation and PC systems.
One of the main assumptions in the suggested demise of the mainframe, and
one which has had a significant impact of late, is downsizing. This is the
concept that, as technology allows the same performance to be packed into an
ever-smaller physical size, so the need for the big boxes will diminish to
an eventual vanishing point of economic non-viability.
The evidence is now starting to point away from this inevitability. Instead,
the term 'right-sizing' is starting to gain credence. With that credence
comes an appreciation that the mainframe will continue to have an important
role. What is more the corollary of downsizing, that the technology will be
exploited to add more power and performance to a system of any given
physical size and price, will provide continued justification for that role.
Right-sizing takes as its basis the fact that different types of
applications in information management require different systems
architectures to run them most efficiently. Therefore, while it is far more
sensible to run a highly user-interactive mix of spreadsheeting, graphics
and text report writing applications together on a PC, the same platform is
totally inadequate as the host of a large, on-line transaction processing
system.
Here, there is really no alternative to a large mainframe installation and
an extensive disk farm of on-line data storage. As such on-line transactions
processing (OLTP) systems are the life-blood of most large corporations,
such as the financial institutions, there is unlikely to be any significant
reduction in either the role of or demand for mainframe systems.
The main differentiator that defines mainframes, minicomputers and
workstations/PCs, is the relationship between an application's data and
functionality.
An application that is data-rich but functionally poor, such as OLTP or
large database management, is ideally suited to a mainframe solution.
Applications with the inverse ratio suit the workstation/PC, while the
minicomputer matches applications which require a reasonable mix of these
two elements.
The fact that there is still very much a role for mainframes has not meant a
healthy flow of business for the manufacturers. Industry-leader IBM
indicated that the slump in its business, thought to have been stemmed
following a good fourth quarter last year, looks set to continue for at
least the first half of this year.
The company has laid the blame on the spreading recession throughout Europe
and Japan, though US analysts, such as Mr Ulric Weil of Weil Associates,
have suggested that downsizing aspirations by customers is also having a
considerable impact on the company's mainframe sales.
There is a negative impact felt from the problems in computer leasing
business, which has been a significant sales route through which IBM has
reached its customer base.
The recession is, a big worry for IBM's mainframe business, for it has
followed smartly on its introduction of a complete new range of systems, the
System/390 range, described by Mr Tony Cleaver, IBM chairman and chief
executive, as the biggest and most important announcement for a quarter of
century.
In spite of that significance, sales of systems in the range have been slow,
except for a small increase which occurred during the fourth quarter last
year. Then, sales of the most powerful, six processor systems, the ES/9000
Model 900, and the top of the entry-level machines, Models 330 and 340, rose
sharply.
This looks as though it has been a temporary excursion, and that sales will
continue slowly. As well as the problems of recession, the machines mark a
fairly radical step function both in performance and compatibility with the
the existing IBM mainframe product family, the 370 Series.
There are only a limited number of bridges between the two families, and
users of 370 series machines may first have to upgrade their existing
systems to one of the configurations at which a transition to the equivalent
ES/9000 can be made. There have also been some missed compatibility
opportunities in fairly obvious, even rather silly areas.
For example, the upper range of the ES/9000 series is water-cooled, as are
the 370 series machines, yet they use different diameter piping to supply
the coolant.
In spite of the continued reliance on proprietary architectures and
operating systems from the mainframe suppliers, there are signs that open
systems concepts are now penetrating deeply.
Amdahl, for example, is still the only mainframe supplier to offer an
implementation of Unix as a native operating system on its machines. Others,
including IBM, only offer it as a guest running under the proprietary
operating system.
Unix on the mainframe has been a slow starter, but some users see it as a
way out of being locked in to not only proprietary systems, but the pricing
that can go with them. It offers opportunities in providing more coherent
communications between different hardware platforms, a fundamental element
of open systems, if they are all running broadly the same operating system.
If Unix does become more prominent on mainframe systems, it offers the
chance of greater freedom for the IBM plug compatible systems manufacturers,
which include the likes of Amdahl and Fujitsu.
These have built their businesses on making hardware that runs IBM software
but is cheaper and/or more readily available than IBM kit. Any significant
switch to Unix in the market could allow both them and the users a wider,
more competitive choice of sources for applications software. It could
reverse the current situation and allow a native Unix to act as host to a
manufacturer's existing proprietary operating system. This would provide
current users of proprietary systems with continuity as well as broadening
the choice of upgrade path.

THE trend to downsizing where applications previously carried out on a
mainframe can now often be done on a mini; and the power that one expected
from a mini now being available in today's top of the range PCs is having a
profound effect on the market for printers.
On the one hand, advanced features and performance is required and yet, at
the same time, the market will not bear prices which appear to be out of all
relationship with the falling prices of the PCs to which the devices will be
connected.
Some users want colour, others need improved quality such as higher
resolution (in dots per inch) while many departments need to handle
multi-part forms. Furthermore, a growing proportion of users need a graphics
capability to handle a variety of text fonts and sizes as well as charts and
more complex images. This is a facility which is widely available,
especially in the non-impact page printers.
One long-felt business need is colour to enable, for example, profits/losses
to be more readily seen in a spreadsheet. The simplest way of achieving this
is to use a printer with a two-colour ribbon as was used in a manual
typewriter. Where this would be too slow, colour ink jet and thermal
transfer printers come into their own.
'The market for high quality colour printers is one which, until now, has
been supplied with high priced machines,' says Mr Richard Bright of
Mannesmann Tally, printer manufacturer. 'By introducing a sub-Pounds 2,000
thermal transfer page printer we have significantly reduced the cost of
colour page printing, without sacrificing print quality. What was a
specialist piece of equipment is now available to general business users.'
According to BIS CAP International the European colour printer market is set
to expand from 170,000 units in 1990 to 500,000 in 1994 and will be worth
about Dollars 1.3bn by 1994. The UK printer market is likely to grow from
45,000 units in 1990 to 180,000 in 1994. It will be worth Dollars 400m by
1994.
While, no doubt, some of this growth will come from normal business users, a
growing proportion will be in computer-aided design (CAD) and desktop
publishing where users will be able to get a colour representation of their
documents before going out to print in high volume.
The widely-used laser printer with its 300 x 300 dots per inch (DPI)
resolution is frequently not considered adequate for DTP. Hence, once the
work has been completed on the Macintosh (or PC), the actual camera-ready
artwork is prepared on a higher resolution printer often of more than 1,000
DPI.
Bridging the two markets is the Qume CrystalPrint Express. Not only does
this 12 page per minute (appreciably faster than the average laser printer)
provide 600 x 300 resolution which is adequate for many applications it
incorporates a number of interfaces (including AppleTalk) and emulations
which together offer the compatibility required when the printer is a
'shared resource' on a local area network (LAN).
Also vying for this market are other versatile printers such as the Kodak
Ektaplus 7016 and the HP Laserjet III Si from Hewlett-Packard, the market
leader in the non-impact market. While both of these are 16 pages per minute
(PPM) the former incorporates a 6 PPM photocopier 'designed for those simple
one or two copies tasks common in the busy office environment thus
increasing productivity by reducing waiting time at the photocopier'.
The latter, using HP's resolution enhancement technology together with
microfine toner, is claimed to give resolution akin to that of a 600 DPI
printer. One of its options is that it can have a direct high-speed
connection to a LAN, such as Novell, so obviating the need for a separate PC
as a printer-server. This is far more cost-effective than with many
networked printers.
Laser and ink jet printers are 'non-impact' unlike dot-matrix machines which
tend to have a low-tech image and are often derided for their lower quality
and high noise level. In spite of this they are the workhorses of industry
and commerce and are able to handle multi-part forms which the other
technologies cannot handle. According to Romtec, the market analyst, for
those reasons plus cost they still account for 57 per cent of the UK market
with laser and inkjet holding for 27 and 11.7 per cent respectively.
For example, Epson which tends to be identified as the world's predominant
supplier of dot matrix printers (in spite of claiming to take a growing
share of the non-impact market) produces both general purpose and
specialised products. A good example of the latter is its DFX-1000. This is
a heavy duty system printer which will handle high-speed printing of
multi-part forms at up to 300 lines per minute making it, they believe, the
fastest serial impact printer in the world.
However, Romtec also reports that, during the fourth quarter of 1990, Epson
and Hewlett-Packard had 29.2 and 23.6 per cent respectively of the printer
sales (in units) to business end users via dealers, distributors. Retailers
direct sales by the manufacturers only accounted for a very small
proportion. But, as the Epson business is largely in the lower-cost dot
matrix market, the value of HP's sales is higher.
The dot matrix market is facing tough competition - especially from inkjet
printers - as users become more conscience of the image that their own
printed output creates.
Ms Nicky Ayre, product manager at HP says the Deskjet HP DJ500 is 'the
better alternative to the dot matrix and that there is no longer a
price-penalty to pay for higher quality'. She says HP is focusing on the
higher quality that is being expected by the discerning users. The HP DJ500
is ideal as a personal printer where the requirement is for about 50 pages
per day and is increasingly being installed in people's homes.
It can be seen that there is no universal requirement. As a result, the
variety of printers continues to grow. Unfortunately, it is not easy to find
the collection of features that are needed at an affordable price.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (15): It all depends on the
number of chips - Semiconductors, when is a computer company not a computer
company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

MR Bernard Giroud, vice-president of Intel, takes strong exception to anyone
calling his organisation a computer company. By contrast, Mr Tom Beaver,
vice-president of Motorola, positively insists on his organisation being
called a computer company.
Regardless of how they prefer to be styled, both of these leading US
semiconductor manufacturers now make products which used to be made by
computer companies. As computer companies concentrate on profitable
activities such as software and systems integration, semiconductor companies
such as Intel and Motorola are spending more of their time manufacturing
computers.
Ten years ago, the computer companies simply provided customers with their
computers. Now the task of traditional computer companies has shifted, says
Mr Giroud. 'The end user is asking for more software, more assistance, more
training,' he says.
As computer companies have moved away from their older manufacturing role,
Intel, the world's leading manufacturer of microprocessors, has moved in.
'We are doing what an ICL or a Nixdorf was doing 10 years ago,' Mr Giroud
says. 'We are making the central processing unit that ICL used to make 10
years ago.'
The reason he insists on Intel not being called a computer company is that
it does not deal directly with the end users of computers. 'A computer
company is a company that sells solutions to the end user. We supply
hardware to the system integrators. They supply the technology to the end
user, combined with the software. We are not in competition with Compaq,
Hewlett-Packard or IBM.'
Motorola, America's biggest semiconductor maker, sees itself as being more
directly involved in the computer industry. Mr Beaver says the company
regards itself as a manufacturer of standard computers, along with their
operating software. The only area in which Motorola is not involved is in
the provision of applications software.
Five years ago Motorola established a separate computer division, which Mr
Beaver heads. One of the reasons why Motorola wanted to move more decisively
into computer manufacture was to help influence the debate over common
operating standards.
The computer industry worldwide has seen a move away from computers which
are unable to communicate with those provided by other manufacturers.
Customers are increasingly insisting on common standards or open systems.
They are demanding that different manufacturers provide computers that can
talk to one another. Motorola makes computers which use A T &amp; T's Unix
operating system.
The move from proprietary to open systems provided Motorola with what it saw
as a commercial opportunity.
'We saw a lot of computer companies struggling through the transition from
proprietary to open systems. We saw a lot of them deciding to become niche
companies, specialising in banking, insurance, what have you. They're
letting someone else build the hardware. We saw that as an opportunity
because our corporation is good at competing in commodity products. We make
computers as a commodity item,' says Mr Beaver.
Mr Beaver says he sees the world computer industry today as being divided
into three groups. The first consists of companies providing a mixture of
computers adhering to both their own and to common operating standards. He
says the American companies IBM, DEC, Unisys and Hewlett-Packard belong in
this category, along with Siemens of Germany.
The second group consists of companies providing computer systems to clients
in particular fields, such as banking or law, and contracting out much of
the hardware manufacture. He puts Wang of the US, Olivetti of Italy, Philips
of the Netherlands and Nixdorf of Germany (now part of Siemens) in this
group.
The third group consists of companies providing products for the open
systems market. NCR, Intel, A T &amp; T, Sun Microsystems and Compaq - all of
the US - fall into this category, as do most of the Japanese computer
companies. So, he says, does Motorola. Participating in a commodity market,
he says, these companies have to sell computers on the basis of price and
performance.
The move by many computer companies away from manufacturing is not the only
reason that some chip companies have become computer manufacturers. Mr
Giroud points out that technological developments mean that computers use
fewer and fewer chips.
'At the moment, you take two chips from Intel, eight chips from someone
else, add the memory, and you have a personal computer. In 1984 or 1985, you
needed 170 chips plus the memory to make a computer. In 1993, the 10 chips
plus the memory you need today will become one chip plus the memory,' Mr
Giroud says.
As the number of chips used in computers shrinks, semiconductor makers
effectively become computer manufacturers. 'What we are doing is we are
putting a PC on a chip,' Mr Giroud says. 'The chips we are designing now
have 4m to 5m transistors.'

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (14): Three-tier structure
crumbles - Distribution Channels, a year of change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LETTICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE past year has seen big changes in the ownership of the companies which
distribute computer equipment in the UK. In general, control of the leading
companies has moved outside of this country.
In the past 12 months Frontline, one of the most successful of UK computer
distributors, has been taken over by German distributor Computer 2000, while
network specialist QDL has fallen to Micro Macro, a Netherlands combine, and
in the past few weeks Software Limited has been taken over by Ingram Micro
of the US.
These changes of ownership are arguably less important than the changes in
the structures of computer distribution channels that have been taking
place.
A few years ago computer distribution channels in the UK could be defined
quite easily. The manufacturer at the top would sell equipment to
distributors, who in their turn would sell it on to computer dealers. But
more recently this three-tier structure has begun to erode.
Pressure on profit margins has encouraged manufacturers to remove the centre
distributor tier, and to deal direct with computer dealers, and even with
customers. At the same time, we have seen the growth of the super dealer,
operations such as Computacenter and Technology which are large enough to
deal directly with suppliers, and dealer/distributors.
The two types of operation meet in the middle, with dealer-led companies
such as Computacenter and Technology becoming, to all intents and purposes,
distributors, and with distribution operations such as Rossendale, adding
computer dealer operations to broaden their base. Pressure on margins is
such that it is difficult to see, in the minds of many analysts, how an
operation that deals solely as an intermediary, taking equipment from a
manufacturer and passing it on to a computer dealer without gaining any
extra profit margin from selling direct to users, can survive.
One danger for the trade-only distributor is that the market will split,
leaving such companies handling mainly the more esoteric product ranges and
lower volume shipments to smaller dealers.
As the bigger dealerships are beginning to show, and as smaller distributors
which move back into direct sales confirms, large amounts of money can be
made through a combination of relatively limited product ranges shipped at
high volumes.
Mr Derek Lewis, head of Technology, argues that large corporate dealerships
such as his own company should concentrate on on two, maybe three ranges of
computer hardware. Mr Lewis's company is a member of Comec, one of two big
European dealer associations, and the implications of this are clear - if
the dealers throughout Europe who are members of Comec decide on an official
range of computers, they can drive a very hard bargain, forcing the margins
of manufacturers down.
This worries Mr Don Pinchbeck, managing director at Epson UK. He feels that
'the reseller who is pan-European can seize power from manufacturers'. Comec
and the International Computer Group (ICG), which is the rival association
of which Computacenter is a member, can through the combined buying power of
their membership overturn the food chain, controlling the manufacturers
rather than being controlled. If this happens, Mr Pinchbeck sees computer
manufacturers becoming very much like the suppliers of UK supermarkets,
having prices, terms and conditions dictated to them by a few all-powerful
chains. A possible escape-route, he feels, involves manufacturers learning
from the motor industry and moving machines tailored to individual
specification straight off the production line. The manufacturer, in effect,
would become a systems integrator.
Other manufacturers are however exploring different routes to survival. One
of the basic planks on which Compaq was founded was its determination not to
sell direct, but in recent years, as the power of its equipment has
increased, the company has found itself evolving what is in effect a direct
sales force that does not sell direct.
With the exception of the large chains, a company's individual dealers do
not have the resources to sell adequately into what is, in effect, the
minicomputer market. If a company will not set up the kind of direct sales
force traditionally used to sell minis, it finds itself forced to do an
increasing amount of hand holding for the dealers who are making the sales.
Compaq UK has in the past few years hired a number of staff from mini
manufacturers, and Mr Gian Carlo Bisone, head of European marketing, is no
stranger to these techniques.
The nature of the market accentuates these problems. Mr Bisone describes the
primary characteristic of the dealer channel as being that it has no money,
and Compaq pursues intricate schemes in order to inject money into it
without the extra cash disappearing in the shape of increased discounts to
customers.
Training and joint marketing programmes are examples of how this can be
done. Other manufacturers are engaged in heavy support programmes for their
dealer base, and one possible consequence of such approaches is that dealers
 -particularly those who are not part of large associations - will become
more closely bound to single manufacturers. These manufacturers may, albeit
accidentally, convert their dealer base into what is effectively a direct
sales force.
In the UK, Apple has traditionally taken a similar approach to Compaq,
attempting to keep prices and the level of its dealer expertise high, and
taking a highly combative line with discount houses. However, it has created
a problem for itself, in terms of sales channels, with its new low-cost
range of machines. There are rumours that the company will later this year
release a range aimed fair and square at the home/games market which
indicates that the problem can only get worse.
Selling these without overturning the applecart and forcing down prices on
its higher specification machines is a puzzle Apple is still working on. Mr
John Sculley, chief executive officer, has made confusing and perhaps
ominous references to rapid turnover-style outlets.
There is an alternative that Apple will almost certainly reject. If
manufacturers in general find themselves facing lower margins on the
machines they sell into distribution channels, is it not logical for them to
consider reducing the number of tiers in the channels, or perhaps eliminate
them completely by selling direct to users?
Speaking at a conference in Dusseldorf last month, Mr Billy Ho, Mitac
associate vice-president told the company's distributors that, at least for
machines that are priced at commodity level, the company would have to face
up to a reduction in the number of tiers in the channels.
Mitac, a Taiwanese company, is one of the largest computer manufacturers in
the world, although its name isn't that well known to users because it has
traditionally built for other computer companies. His view was that Mitac
distributors worldwide would have to begin to sell direct to users in order
to increase sales and maintain profitability, and if as seems likely other
manufacturers are thinking along similar lines, the future could hold
increased terrors for independent dealers.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (13): Consortia add to
confusion - Standards, users wait in vain for common technologies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPUTER industry is driven by fashion, and industry standards is the
current craze. At one time, indeed, it seemed as if a genuine enthusiasm for
common standards might result in lower costs and greater simplicity of
operations for customers, a notion much promoted by the manufacturers
themselves.
The belief was that if manufacturers were prepared to agree common
technologies for operating computers, connecting them together and running
software, users would be saved the cost and complexity of connecting
dissimilar hardware. At the same time, software suppliers would be able to
write programs capable of being run on any machine, cutting the cost of the
multiple versions they have to produce at present.
That, however, has proved a vain hope. For most computer users, the
standards issue has become hopelessly confused. The suppliers have done
little to help matters, taking part in seemingly endless series of industry
consortia to promote one standard or another. There are compelling financial
reasons for this apparent waywardness - backing the wrong standards horse
can be an expensive mistake. But somewhere along the line, the idea of
common standards to which everybody in the industry adheres for the benefit
of the customer has been lost.
Common standards are crucial to the idea of open systems, which most
observers believe will play an increasingly important part in data
processing over the next decade.
What is an open system? According a new handbook*, they are defined as:
'those that conform to internationally agreed standards defining computing
environments that allow users to develop, run and interconnect applications
and the hardware they run on, from whatever source, without significant
conversion cost'.
The author goes on to point out that the key factors for users are that no
single supplier actually 'owns' (that is, has control of) the environments
involved and that the mixing and matching of applications and hardware can
be achieved without significant cost.
The reality is that every supplier of any size is scrabbling to own, or at
least share ownership, of any hardware or software element which looks as if
it stands a fair chance of becoming a standard. The result has been a series
of pitched battles which show no real signs of abating.
Even the oldest standards war, the fight over how best to connect computers
together in telecommunications networks, has yet to be resolved after more
than 15 years.
On the one hand, standards setting bodies are trying to establish a set of
rules called Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) which they have now almost
completely defined. On the other hand, International Business Machines (IBM)
is insisting that its SNA rules will remain the way for its own machines to
be connected together, while many customers are content with rules called
TCP/IP devised by the US Defense Department.
Or consider, for example, the latest industry initiative, a consortium of 20
leading suppliers including the US companies Compaq, the leading supplier of
high performance personal computers, Control Data, the mainframe supplier
and Digital Equipment, the world's principal minicomputer maker. It also
includes the Japanese suppliers NEC, Nippon Kokan KK and Sony.
The consortium has established what it calls an Advanced Computing
Environment (Ace) whose elements include support for software operating
environments from Microsoft (OS/2 version 3.0) and the Santa Cruz Operation
(Open Desktop, a version of the Unix operating systems) and microprocessor
chips from Intel (80/386, 80/486 and so on) and MIPS Computer Systems'
(advanced reduced instruction set computing, or Risc) chips.
The aim of the group is to 'unify' the industry by establishing standards
combining software and hardware technologies from personal computers,
computer workstations and multi-processor computers.
The group does not include, however, IBM, the world's largest computer
manufacturer, which frequently seems to behave as if it feels it has an
inalienable right to decide which standards the industry will adopt. It is a
leading light behind the Open Software Foundation, which has been developing
its own Unix-like operating systems, OSF1.
Some observers see the formation of the Ace consortium as a challenge to
IBM; others as an attempt to displace Sun Microsystems from its dominant
position in the Unix workstation market place.
Sun, an ambitious, fast-growing company, has about two-thirds of the market
for Unix workstations based on its proprietary Risc design called 'sparc'.
It has been licensing this design widely in an aggressive attempt to
establish it as the industry Risc standard.
One of the first licensees was Solbourne, a workstation manufacturer. Mr
Barrie Murray-Upton, its vice-president of European operations, said after
the announcement of Ace: 'Why would 20 of the world's leading computer
manufacturers band together to form a consortium unless they were seriously
worried about the continuing success of sparc technology?'
The Ace group's attempt to appear cohesive was not helped, either, by the
emergence of a splinter group among the 20 declaring its support for yet
another version of Unix. The upshot of all this wrangling is that customers'
need for genuinely open systems has been hijacked and treated with contempt
by rival industry gangs.
Groups of users have attempted to establish their own ginger groups, but
with only limited success - General Motors' attempt to set a manufacturing
automation protocol (MAP) is one example.
Earlier this year, in initiative sponsored by the user arm of X/Open, one of
the earliest standards pressure groups,representing hundreds of users met in
Dallas, Texas, to formulate plans to encourage manufacturers to speed up the
introduction of open systems. They deliberated and drew up lists of their
requirements. The resolutions, however, fell far short of an ultimatum to
the manufacturers. Computer users, to some extent, have only themselves to
blame for the way manufacturers treat them.

performance - Supercomputers, a faster rate of change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER only 12 years service at the Aldermaston Atomic Weapons Establishment,
the world's first modern day supercomputer is already an antique.
The Cray 1A, the pioneering computer designed by Seymour Cray after he
founded Cray Research in the mid-1970s, has been consigned to a disused
aircraft hangar used by the London Science Museum to store exhibits. Donated
to the Museum by the Cray company, it will eventually be displayed as part
of the Computing Collection.
Weighing eight tonnes and operating at 160m floating point operations a
second (Flops), a measure of supercomputing performance, it cost Pounds 8m
in 1979. Now it is: 'Outdated, large and expensive for what it does by
modern standards' according to the Science Museum's Mr Peter Bailes. Today's
top of the range Cray, the YMP-8 with eight processors weighs considerably
less, operates at a peak of 2.5bn flops and costs about Dollars 20m.
The Cray 1A was designed to stand alone; Cray's newest machines are built
for what Mr John Rollwagen, the company's chief executive, calls 'network
supercomputing'; providing number crunching capability as part of a network
of smaller computers.
The rapid advances in technology which have so quickly dated the Cray 1A,
have also changed the shape of the supercomputer business.
Only a few years ago, there were two dominant manufacturers, Cray and
Control Data of the US, supplying a tiny group of customers who both needed
the power and could afford the price of the fastest available computing
hardware. Today, the same customers - meteorologists, oil exploration
organisations, aerospace companies and automobile manufacturers - still need
supercomputer performance.
Peugeot SA, for example, an organisation comprising the two French
automobile manufacturers Automobiles Peugeot and Automobiles Citroen, has
just ordered a Cray YMP2E, a two processor system that nevertheless delivers
some 600 mips. It will be used for general automobile research and design
including structural analysis, crash simulation, acoustic design and the
simulation of car behaviour.
The supercomputer landscape has changed irrevocably, however, over the past
two years. Control Data, the US supercomputing pioneer has moved out of the
area altogether, as commercial difficulties in other parts of its business
made the heavy research and development investment necessary to stay at the
leading edge too great a burden.
Seymour Cray detached himself from Cray Research to establish a new company
devoted to the development of the Cray 3, an innovative machine based on
chips fabricated in gallium arsenide, a material which makes possible speeds
of about three times the maximum possible from silicon.
The new machine depends on a whole range of new technologies including
assembly by robots and is proving a severe challenge even for a man
recognised as the world's foremost supercomputer designer.
International Business Machines, which for many years had tended to ignore
supercomputing as a niche market where the return hardly justified the
investment, changed its mind and came back to the market with a family of
vector processors - conventional high performance mainframes with a bolt-on
accessory giving a performance for certain applications close to that of a
supercomputer. It also funded research into an advanced supercomputer being
developed by Mr Steve Chen, formerly a senior designer with Cray Research.
The three Japanese mainframe manufacturers, Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC
launched supercomputers of impressive performance. While critics argue that
their machines are let down by inferior software when compared to the Cray
range, there can be little doubt that in hardware terms the Japanese
machines are set to challenge the best US designs
The principal change in the market, however, has been wrought by a different
kind of advance. The emergence of two new kinds of supercomputer -
minisupercomputers and massively parallel machines, which offer much of the
performance of a conventional supercomputer at a fraction of the cost - have
opened new markets for supercomputing. Supercomputers, in fact, is a name
not much to the liking of computer engineers who prefer the expression
'scientific computers'.
On this basis, a high performance Sun workstation carrying out scientific
and engineering calculations is in the foothills of supercomputer
performance. Speed is the important factor especially where, for example,
weather forecasting is involved. As Mr Bryan Little, director of operations
for Cray Research in Europe, points out, the calculations involved in
weather prediction can be carried out by a small machine - but by the time
the answer has been delivered, the storm will have passed.
Minisupercomputers have the capacity to tackle many kinds of calculation and
simulation. Some approach the speed of a full scale supercomputer. FPS
Computing, for example, which started out building 'go-faster' processors
has launched a machine which it rates at 2.1bn flops on typical mathematical
routines - close to the performance of a Dollars 20m Cray for less than
Dollars 2m.
The kinds of customer who can take advantage of minisupercomputing power
include scientists carrying out electromagnetic analysis, structural
analysis, signal processing and computational chemistry.
Typical of the new superminicomputer manufacturers is Convex Computer
Corporation, another company experimenting with esoteric gallium arsenide
technology to give speed at low cost.
Cray, faced with the first threat to its pre-eminence in supercomputing in
many years, has been forced to meet the challenge from Convex and other
minisupercomputer makers by launching smaller, air-cooled models in its YMP
series. It also bought a US-based minisupercomputer maker, Supertek
Computers, and now sells its S-1 machine.
Massively parallel machines are constructed by manufacturers such as
Thinking Machines of the US. These rely for their power on hundreds or
thousands of individual processing chips connected together and co-ordinated
by special software.
Where is Europe in all this? Nowhere in conventional supercomputing. It
does, however, have the skills to build massively parallel machines, using,
for example, the Inmos transputer, a processing chip designed for parallel
processing applications.
Edinburgh University, for example, is particularly advanced in
transputer-based supercomputing. But it will require funding on a
substantial scale for Europe to make much headway against the US and Japan.
In the latest in a long series of warnings that Europe is throwing away the
supercomputing future, the Italian physicist Mr Carlo Rubbia and a panel of
experts have urged the development of pan-European high speed computer
communications network backed by a Community expenditure by 1995 of 1bn Ecus
a year.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (10): Unsatisfactory term,
must try harder - The Schools, anxiety for the class of '91
</HEADLINE>

THE UK schools' computer business has been going through an unsatisfactory
term and there seems little prospect of improvement in the near future.
The two principal manufacturers in the sector, Acorn Computers of Cambridge
and Research Machines of Oxford, have been monitoring their sales figures
anxiously as the financial year draws to a close and are becoming convinced
that economic circumstances and legislative changes are conspiring to force
into decline a market which normally expands reliably if unspectacularly.
Mr Michael Fischer, chairman and chief executive of Research Machines, said
the sales bonanza which usually characterises the first three months of the
year had failed to materialise.
'It is pretty bad news for us,' he said, adding that the sales decline was
disappointing after the company's record results last year. Its turnover was
Pounds 63m with pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.25m.
Mr Sam Wauchope, managing director of Acorn Computers, said sales had been
uneven through the year.
He did not think there would be a first-quarter sales increase and overall
he believed total spending in schools would decline.
School computer sales normally surge in the first quarter of the year
because, with the end of the financial year in sight, special grants for
computer purchase, worth perhaps Pounds 1m to Pounds 2m, become available on
an ad hoc basis from the Department of Education and Science and the
Department of Trade and Industry.
In the current economic climate, however, suppliers are not optimistic that
money will be available from these sources this year.
Schools and local education authorities have traditionally raced to spend
their financial allocations by the end of the financial year with the result
that money from a variety of budgets becomes available for computers.
This year, suppliers believe that schools are storing cash away against a
bleak economic outlook. The evidence is that they are deferring decisions to
buy more computers.
While exact numbers have yet to be collated following the end of the
government's financial year this month, it seems likely that a market that
was expected to grow by 10 per cent will contract by the same amount, an
overall decline of some 20 per cent.
This bad news comes at the end of 12 months of unsettling volatility in what
is normally a predictable market.
The spread of local management of schools (LMS), which by 1993 will ensure
that all schools in England and Wales with more than 200 pupils will control
their own budgets, has resulted in confusion and uncertainty among those
newly responsible for, but unused to, taking decisions about computer
hardware and software. In the past, they have relied heavily on advice from
local education authority advisers. Some will continue to do so.
Also, difficulties local authorities are experiencing in administering the
poll tax has added an element of uncertainty to the value of capitation
grants they will make to schools.
School computing is not big business - the whole UK educational computer
market including colleges, polytechnics and universities is worth less than
Pounds 200m.
It is, however, a niche market par excellence in the computing business and
those companies which have made it their own have enjoyed steady returns in
recent years.
The principal players, Acorn and Research Machines, derive their strength
from the intimate relationship they have built up with their customers,
their understanding of the educational process and their willingness to
provide extensive service for modest returns.
Large suppliers like IBM and Apple, while strong in the universities and
colleges, have little part in school computing and are unlikely to make
inroads.
School computing is two markets in one - the market for educational
computing and the market for educational administration. Research Machines
and Acorn, with a wealth of ready-written, high quality educational software
have cornered the market for educational computing in schools. They are less
dominant in educational administration where there is more of a need for
conventional computer power.
Acorn, part of the Italian Olivetti group which developed the BBC
microcomputer, has dominated the schools market since the early 1980s.
Acorn systems are installed in 85 per cent of schools. It is especially
strong in the primary sector where it boasts familiarity and an impressive
range of educational software, with more than 1,000 programs listed in the
Acorn Education Directory.
Company's latest machines feature a high-performance microprocessor of its
own design which has persuaded Apple Computer of the US to establish a joint
company with VLSI Technology and Acorn to exploit the technology.
About half Acorn's revenues of about Pounds 50m come from sales to schools.
Research Machines of Oxford, privately held, is second overall to Acorn, but
holds 44 per cent of the market in secondary schools and 29 per cent in
colleges.
About 60 per cent of its sales of Pounds 63m are to schools and it has a
strong toehold in government computing and computer-aided design.
Research Machines competes in both the computers for education and computers
for administration sectors. Recently it won a Pounds 4m order to provide
every secondary school in Northern Ireland with the hardware and software
for LMS.
While the combined effects of LMS, the economy and the poll tax on computer
sales are depressing for the companies involved, they also raise questions
about the preparedness of schools to teach the national curriculum.
A recent study by the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology - the
independent body that reports to parliament on the scientific and
technological implications of big issues such as food irradiation and the
greenhouse effect - suggested that schools in England and Wales would need
Pounds 310m during the next five years to deliver the computer education
required by the curriculum.
It is worrying that that sum is unlikely to be made available. It is equally
worrying that nobody seems sure of how much money schools will be prepared
to spend on computers in the next few years.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (9): The shift to open
systems unlocks sector - Europe, a crisis that knows no national boundaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A series of stunningly defensive, whole-page advertisements from Groupe Bull
in Europe's leading newspapers last month highlights the crisis facing the
entire European-owned computer industry. They were used to soften the impact
of the announcement of Bull's FFr6.8bn (Dollars 1.19bn) loss in 1990.
Most of the leading players are trading at a loss. Those, such as Olivetti,
that are still keeping their heads above red ink, are showing greatly
reduced profitability. The crisis knows no national boundaries.
Germany: Siemens-Nixdorf chief executive Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig warned last
month that Europe's largest computer company, formed in 1990 from the ailing
Nixdorf Computers and Siemens' computer interests, would not make profits
this year as he had hoped, nor was he prepared to say when it would become
profitable. The difficulties of assimilating Nixdorf, which had losses of
about Dollars 636m in its last year as an independent company, have proved
far greater than expected.
Comparex, a joint venture between BASF and Siemens selling chiefly
mainframes built by Hitachi of Japan, on the other hand, made post-tax
profits of DM42m, 31 per cent up on the previous year.
France: state-owned Bull's loss is thought to be a record for the industry
in any one year. It is made up of a FFr3bn operating loss and restructuring
charges of about FFr3.8bn. The company is already well advanced with an
ambitious programme of corporate changes designed to restore competitiveness
and vitality. It includes cutting the number of manufacturing plants from 13
to five, reducing staff by some 5,000 over the year and rationalising
research and development and marketing.
Italy: Olivetti has remained consistently in the black, but its
profitability has been falling. Its 1990 turnover is not expected to show
much advance on the L9.031bn recorded in 1989 and its profits are expected
much below the L202.8bn announced that year. It is in the process of
trimming 7,000 jobs from the workforce; manufacturing activities are being
rationalised both in Italy and the rest of the world as are direct and
indirect distribution networks.
The Netherlands: Philips is shedding some 50,000 staff worldwide; the
resulting restructuring charges forced a loss of Fl 4.2bn last year; the
root cause, however, was heavy losses in the information systems division.
Now Philips is moving away from computer systems of its own design to those
built to industry standards.
The UK: International Computers, Britain's largest information technology
company, while still generating good profits, was bought from STC by Fujitsu
last year, leaving the telecommunications company free to concentrate on its
core interests.
The deal with Fujitsu came at the end of a series of abortive merger
discussions between ICL and several other European-owned computer companies.
Apricot Computers, manufacturing arm of the Apricot Group was sold to
Mitsubishi Electric of Japan last year.
In a surprising reversal of fortune, both ICL and Apricot are now selling
UK-designed and manufactured computers in Japan. Smaller manufacturers have
been affected by the same malaise.
Norsk Data of Norway and Nokia Data of Finland are going through extensive
restructuring and job losses in their attempts to return to profitability.
The plight of Europe computer makers is, to some extent, a reflection of the
troubles afflicting every large computer manufacturer worldwide.
Customers, especially governments and the armed forces, are beginning to
move rapidly from traditional, mainframe-based data processing systems to
so-called 'client server systems' where the computing power is supplied by
small computers and workstations networked together.
There is growing demand for computers which can easily be connected into
client server networks regardless of the manufacturer of origin. Industry
standard or open systems are becoming preferred to proprietary designs.
The shift in preference from proprietary designs to open systems took place
with remarkable suddenness. It coincided with a rapid, but temporary,
softening in many of the European markets. Companies such as Nixdorf which
had been gearing up on the back of powerful sales of their proprietary
systems suddenly found themselves facing weak markets with systems which
were no longer in fashion.
Europe will remain an important IT market though the US will remain
dominant. According to figures from the consultancy Price Waterhouse, the
world IT market was worth Dollars 212bn in 1984; the US held 55 per cent,
Europe 25 per cent, Japan 10 per cent with a similar percentage for the rest
of the world.
By 1992, according to Price Waterhouse, the overall value of the market will
have grown to Dollars 649bn.
The US share will have shrunk to 44 per cent, the European share will have
grown to 31.5 per cent with Japan and the rest of the world holding 14 per
cent and 10.5 per cent respectively.
It seems likely that US and Japanese manufacturers will profit from the
growth in the European market, however, rather than the local champions.
There are sharply opposed views on what, if anything, should be done to
support European-owned companies. The French government which owns over 70
per cent of Groupe Bull has agreed to support its restructuring measures,
but it understands that the company has to find a partner to share the load.
There have been talks between Europe's main players aimed at establishing a
single transnational computer company able to rationalise research and
development costs and achieve continent-wide economies of scale, but they
have all foundered on issue of management and control.
Some, looking at the example of Unisys of the US, question whether putting
together failing companies is anything more than a recipe for further
failure.
The European commission recently published a fiercely-debated plan to make
the electronics industry more competitive based on training, standards,
bilateral agreements and collaborative research and development projects. No
new money would be involved.
In doing so, it has moved to more of a hands-off approach to encouraging
competitiveness than earlier and unsuccessful interventionist strategies.
The fate of ICL within the Fujitsu organisation is being watched closely as
an example of the most extreme form of survival measure. It may not be too
long before others are forced to follow suit.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (8): Windows to rooms -
Graphical User Interfaces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SYSTEMS for managing large amounts of information are becoming increasingly
important to business computer-users. For example, the concept of
overlapping 'windows' on computer screens has become popular since its
introduction a decade ago.
In the US, the Xerox research centre at Palo Alto unveiled graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) 10 years ago to replace command-driven interfaces which
tend to restrict the working area of computer screens with control codes.
The easier-to-use window-driven GUIs enable various sources of information
and tools to be worked on in separate windows for a single project.
When numerous projects are under way, it can be difficult and time-consuming
to shuffle round a clutter of overlapping windows. Now Xerox has developed
the 'Rooms' concept which takes the graphical user interface into a wholly
new dimension.
The system puts all the windows that are relevant for a single task into a
separate information workspace (or room), with linking electronic doors that
allow users to work on many projects at the same time. The system also
allows users to collaborate with different sets of people for each project.
Xerox's graphical user interface has always been object-orientated - unlike
many of today's icon-driven interfaces - and is based around a concept of an
electronic desktop. The rooms concept is based on research by cognitive
psychologists and computer scientists at the Xerox PARC research centre.
'The system is based on the idea that personal computers are fine in their
place, but what many workers and planners need to get projects under way is
a large table - a place to spread out files and papers for easy access,'
explains Mr Chris Lindesay, integrated systems manager at Rank Xerox.
The new system allows users to co-ordinate desktops: 'With rooms, all you do
is walk into your specific project office and you find it just as you last
left it, with all your information close at hand,' says Mr Lindesay
The concept, which is now at the advanced development stage, allows users to
create a suite of rooms which can passed around, copied to disk or loaded on
to other workstations. To assist users, an overview room is provided where
users can see the layout of rooms on a single screen.
The system, which Xerox is demonstrating at this years Which Computer? Show,
supports the natural way people work, 'rather than forcing them to change
what they do to suit the limitations imposed by screen-sizes and windowing
systems,' says Mr Lindesay.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (7): Advancing on many
fronts - Japan, plans to build on its supremacy in laptop sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S computer makers are betting that the next generation of computer
users will fall into their laps - literally.
Japanese manufacturers believe their increasing supremacy in the production
and sale of laptop computers will lead to a significant expansion of Japan's
role in the overall computer market.
Japan's consumer electronics companies control half of the laptop and
notebook market, the industry's fastest growing segment. And Japanese
dominance of such critical technologies as disk drives and
liquid-crystal-displays (LCDs), together with Japanese skill at shrinking
components, has led such US stalwarts as IBM and Apple into joint ventures
with their Japanese competitors.
While laptops account for 13 per cent and 20 per cent of the European and US
PC market respectively, they account for almost half of all PCs sold in
Japan. Many analysts believe the European and US figures will double within
three years.
Japanese miniaturisation techniques are sure to help them lead the emerging
palmtop and tablet markets. Japanese companies are increasingly dominant in
disk drives, not only at the low end with hard drives for PCs, but at the
high end for mainframes.
The Japanese have worked hard to improve their software and service in
Japan, and hope to begin exporting such skills in the near future. Even with
their relatively limited presence in the computer-systems and software
market, Japanese manufacturers exported over Dollars 20bn-worth of
computer-related products last year, some 85 per cent of which were in parts
and peripherals.
Japanese makers are increasing their control of high density storage systems
as companies such as Epson and NEC continue to gain share at the expense of
small and medium-size US makers. Japanese companies are certain to widen
their dominant lead in display technologies, including those related to high
definition television (HDTV).
Sharp, Epson, and NEC have clearly established themselves as the world's
leaders in LCD technology. South Korea and Taiwan, their closest
competitors, are years behind, while US makers are virtually non-existent.
Such technologies are growing in importance as HDTV-related systems are used
in a widening variety of applications, including workstations which are
still dominated by US companies.
'There's no use in having a Rolls-Royce engine if you have a poor monitor,'
says Mr Barry Dargan, an analyst at James Capel Pacific in Tokyo.
Japanese producers are forging ahead in other areas, including taking
industry leader IBM head-on in mainframes. Japanese producers including NEC,
Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Toshiba believe their growing presence in PCs will
propel them into complete systems integration, particularly as the mainframe
market matures relative to PCs.
NEC boasts the fastest supercomputer in the world, the SX-3. Japanese
service networks continue to trail their US competitors, notably IBM.
However, Toshiba and NEC continue to improve their growing sales channels in
the US, while Fujitsu's purchase of ICL has catapulted Japan's largest
mainframe maker into the forefront of European sales and distribution
network channels.
Although the Japanese still trail in the development of software for export,
Japanese companies have become highly skilled at designing operating
software systems for the Japanese market. Hitachi and Fujitsu, in
particular, have devoted significant resources to the development of
world-class software.
Such investments will pay off in the future, particularly as the world moves
in the direction of more open industry standards such as Unix, the operating
system developed by A T &amp; T which seems destined to become a world standard
for small computers.
In the end, Japanese computer makers greatest strength may be the growing
dominance of other Japanese industrial sectors. As Japanese industries such
as automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and steel continue to expand and automate,
they are sure to bring Japanese computer makers along with them.
'It's much tougher (for Japanese computer makers) to sell to GM than to
Toyota or Nissan,' says Mr Steven Myers, an analyst at Jardine Fleming in
Tokyo. Given that PC use in Japanese offices is one half that of Europe and
one quarter that in the US, Japan's internal market is poised for a period
of explosive growth.
Japan's estimated Y7,000bn information technology market is the world's
second largest, and is expected to more than double by the end of the
decade. Most of the increase in sales will fall to Japanese makers. Japanese
companies will continue to prefer to grow internally. However, more
companies may resort to either taking equity positions or outright
acquisitions in fields in which Japanese companies trail, such as processing
technologies and software.
'The Japanese have to catch up in some areas and they know it,' says Mr
Dargan. 'If they can't do it themselves, they'll engage in joint ventures or
acquisitions.' Joint ventures such as NMB-Intel are bound to increase as
capital-starved US companies increasingly turn to their deep-pocketed
Japanese competitors.
'Small West Coast tech houses are vulnerable to being cherry-picked,' says
Mr Dargan, pointing to TDK's Dollars 200m acquisition of Silicon Systems in
1989.
Still, Japan's dearth of software programmers - estimated at 600,000 - is
expected to top 1m by the end of the century. Such a shortfall, argue most
analysts, can only partially be made up by subcontracting work to Korea and
China and by buying small US producers. But Japanese computer makers remain
undaunted. If anything, the only impediments most Japanese companies see in
the way of their inevitable advance are political.
Fujitsu, for one, has been extremely wary of a political backlash in Europe
following its purchase of ICL and its exclusion from three of the five
European research consortia to which ICL belonged. Consequently, Japanese
makers will continue the less risky strategy of supplying European makers on
an OEM basis.
'Japanese manufacturers realise they just can't take market share through
competition alone,' says Mr Dargan. Japanese companies are diffusing
proprietary technologies in south-east Asia as the Newly Industrialized
Economies (NIEs) repeat Japan's previous policy of insisting on technology
transfer in return for access to their markets.
US companies, burned by their liberal sharing of technology with Japanese
companies in the past, are trying to demand a more equitable sharing of
know-how.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (6): Patient expansion
continues - The Japanese in Europe, a preference for joint ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TOMKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE European information technology companies continue to experience
difficulties, their Japanese counterparts are patiently expanding their
presence on the Continent and in the UK.
Although Fujitsu's acquisition last year of ICL garnered the most headlines,
scores of Japanese companies are developing production facilities, creating
sales networks and searching for potential joint venture partners in the
region.
'We very much respect the marketing and software capabilities of European
firms, especially their network architecture,' says Mr Hideichi Nose,
vice-president for European operations at NEC.
Most observers believe that except for sales channels and some software,
most European companies have little to offer their Japanese rivals besides
political cover.
'European information technology companies rank very low on the list of who
the Japanese fear,' says Mr David Benda, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd (Asia) in Tokyo.
'The Japanese want to have a presence in Europe. But what can they get by
acquiring a company? Not much, except for distribution,' he adds.
Japanese companies prefer to stay away from high-profile acquisitions, even
friendly ones such as ICL. Instead, most are concentrating on establishing
their own production and sales networks, preferably in the form of joint
ventures.
'We have to be certain that investments in fields like semiconductors are
welcome,' says Mr Taizo Nishimuro, general manager for overseas operations
at Toshiba. 'It might be easier to go it 100 per cent alone or to buy out an
existing firm, but it doesn't guarantee us that those actions will be
welcomed by the community.'
Most observers believe Toshiba will not be alone in co-operating with its
European competitors. Olivetti may be forced to strengthen ties with various
Japanese companies, including Hitachi which provides it with hardware on an
OEM basis. Siemens sells Fujitsu mainframes and supercomputers, licenses
Drams from Toshiba, and given its distribution and service networks, is a
natural match for a Japanese partner.
Meanwhile, Bull's increasing problems may force it to fully embrace NEC,
which now provides the French company with mainframes. 'Bull has to figure
out what it's going to cut, what it's going to keep, and what it's going to
source out,' says Mr Steve Myers, analyst at Jardine Fleming (Securities) in
Tokyo. 'It's entirely conceivable, but not certain, that Bull will become
dependent on NEC hardware and choose to add value through software,' he
says.
Such arrangements - Japanese hardware and customised local software - are
expected to increase as more production becomes application specific.
Fujitsu has formed joint ventures with Quotient of the UK and the British
subsidiary of McDonnell Douglas, to develop software for the banking and
CAD/CAM industries respectively.
Toshiba is developing CMOS chips with SGS Thomson Microelectronics of
Holland, while other Japanese producers are sourcing out much of their local
software and design work. Moreover, even with higher capital costs and
mounting overcapacity in the memory chip market, Japanese companies have not
abandoned direct investment. NEC plans to begin construction of a new
computer production facility in Germany and has just completed upgrading its
plant in Scotland to produce four megabit Drams.
Fujitsu will soon finish a new production facility in Durham in northern
England to produce similar chips.
'Investment has slowed,' admits Mr Mike Jeremy, an analyst at Baring
Securities (Japan). 'But not as much as had been expected.'
Many analysts argue that one of the attractions of western Europe is its
position as a springboard for eastern European market. Over 60 per cent of
Japanese products sold in eastern Europe are shipped from Japanese
subsidiaries in the EC.
'Naturally, because of its proximity and its similar culture we do feel
entering eastern Europe is easier through the west, especially Germany,'
says Mr Nishimuro. As personal incomes grow in the former Comecon states,
the market will shift from large-scale infrastructure projects (a relative
European strength) to consumer-driven purchases sure to favour the Japanese,
say most analysts.
Moreover, some Japanese companies are attracted by the East's low wages and
relatively well-educated workforce. Such allures may lead many Japanese
companies to shift much of their assembly operations to the east, and to
concentrate on more value-added production in the West.
'To the extent you put semiconductor production into western Europe, board
stuffing can then be done where it's cheapest,' says Mr Myers.
Political uncertainties remain the greatest fear among senior executives in
Tokyo. Fujitsu, in particular, is wary of projecting a high-profile image.
'ICL is a different company,' says Mr Yuri Momomoto, of Fujitsu. 'They have
their own plans which we don't know about.' Regardless, except for political
sensitivities, and perhaps being privy to the setting of standards, most
Japanese companies seem unconcerned with being shut out of European research
consortia, largely because Japanese companies have much more to contribute
than the Europeans themselves.
'It doesn't make sense to keep out the Japanese,' says Mr Jeremy. 'The
Europeans will lose the opportunity to monitor them. It's a two-way street.
It's no more Machiavellian than that.'
In addition, many argue that dictates from Brussels may ultimately backfire.
A 1990 decision by the European Commission setting minimum prices for
Japanese chips allegedly being dumped in Europe may help Japanese producers
beset by falling prices in the same way a similar 1985 US decree (now
expired) rescued a Japanese chip industry drowning in its own overcapacity.
Moreover, adds Mr Benda, as Europe continues to insist that more products be
manufactured locally, more Japanese companies will come, posing a further
threat to European companies. Others argue, however, that even if Japanese
companies were to show that they are 'politically correct' by participating
in projects such as the research consortia, it is doubtful that they would
be willing to share any of their most advanced technology - something they
have never done in the past.
'There must be another mechanism by which the Japanese are forced to share
some of their technology,' says a Tokyo-based industry observer. 'If the
Europeans don't band together and try to do something then they may as well
throw in the towel.'

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (5): New generation
challenges leaders - The view from the US, Louise Kehoe in San Francisco
assesses changing market strategies and unveils a palmtop

THE US computer industry is in the midst of a broad restructuring driven by
technology advances that have changed the economics of computer
manufacturing.
Some of the largest companies in the industry are being forced to make
painful adjustments, while a new generation of computer makers is growing
rapidly. Making these changes more difficult for all computer companies are
the triple troubles of a recessionary domestic economy, European economic
ills and the interruption of normal purchasing patterns created by the Gulf
War.
The effects of these problems are being keenly felt by many US computer
companies, creating an industry downturn in which revenue growth has been
stalled and earnings are expected to decline in the short term. While these
economic problems are expected to be short lived, the fundamental changes
under way in computer technology could reshape the industry in the 1990s,
analysts predict.
The most important technology trend is the rising power of the
microprocessor - the 'computer on a chip'. The initial impact of the
microprocessor was to create the personal computer, spawning a new
generation of computer companies in the 1980s such as Apple Computer, which
has annual revenues of Dollars 5.5bn, and Compaq Computer with Dollars
3.6bn.
Networking technology, which enables large numbers of PCs to be tied
together so that they can share data, transformed the PC from a stand-alone
single user machine into an important element of office automation systems.
The PC has had a large impact upon the way computers are used in offices.
They have greatly expanded the use of desktop computers and to a significant
extent displaced the minicomputer and computer terminals as standard office
automation equipment. The computer workstation, also based upon
microprocessors, has had a similar impact upon the technical computing
field.
Engineering workstations running computer-aided design programs, for
example, have usurped the role of mid-range computers in thousands of
laboratories and product development departments. Sun Microsystems, the
workstation market leader, has established a Dollars 2.5bn market for
high-powered desktop computers based upon Reduced Instruction Set Computing
(RISC) microprocessors, largely at the expense of traditional computer
companies such as Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard.
However, the inroads of the microprocessor have just begun. High-powered
computer systems that rival the system performance of mainframes and
minicomputers are being built using multiple microprocessors. Companies such
as Sequent Computer can offer mainframe-class computers built around Intel
microprocessors at a fraction of the cost of IBM mainframes.
Stratus Computer Systems is challenging IBM and Tandem Computers in the
market for fault tolerant computers for mission critical applications using
computers built around Motorola and MIPS Computers microprocessors. This
phenomenon, known as downsizing, has had an impact on the entire computer
industry.
'The microprocessor has turned hardware computer economics upside down,'
says Mr Steven Milunovich of Solomon Brothers, in a recent report on the
discontinuities in the computer industry. 'Multiprocessor systems will
directly threaten mainframe and minicomputer solutions,' he says.
'Relational data bases can transform data into information. Object-oriented
programming will reduce the applications backlogs that plague every level of
computing. And sophisticated networks will allow users to access data
seamlessly across the enterprise. Those vendors that can bridge these
discontinuities to aid customers in adopting new technologies, while
protecting prior investments, will benefit the most,' he says. However,
hardware is only one side of the computer industry. Software and services
are growing faster and have higher profit margins.
Companies such as Electronic Data Systems are riding the wave of the
computer services rise, providing computer users with solutions to their
increasingly complex information technology needs.
Another driving force behind the reshaping of the computer industry is the
trend toward open-systems standards that enable different types and brands
of computers to work more efficiently together. With majority of computer
companies are pursuing open systems, with varying degrees of enthusiasm.
For many, open systems represent an opportunity to infiltrate the customer
bases of industry leaders such as IBM and Digital Equipment, HP and Unisys.
The industry leaders have adopted open systems in part as a defensive move.
They view open systems as a means of providing customers with complete
solutions to their computing needs.
One of the critical needs of the 1990s among computer users, is to find a
way to tie together their inventories of computers, which have typically
been acquired in a rather haphazard fashion.
During the 1980s, distributed computing was in vogue. Departments of large
corporations frequently installed their own computer networks or systems
often with little reference to the corporate data processing centre. Now,
companies are trying to tie these computers together to create
enterprise-wide networks.
Enthusiasm for open systems and the trend toward lower-cost computer power
leads some to conclude that the large US computer hardware companies are
dinosaurs. This is to ignore several factors. While the mainframe computer
is challenged by new technologies, it remains a dominant sector of the
computer industry providing, for example, about half of IBM's Dollars 69bn
annual revenues.
Open systems, based upon the Unix operating system, are certainly becoming
more popular, but they represent only 12 per cent of annual computer sales.
The ability of established industry leaders to adjust to rapid changes in
the computer industry is frequently brought into question, but IBM is
turning itself slowly but surely to address the issues of the computer
market head on.
IBM is focusing upon solution selling, reorganising its business units to
more directly address the problems of its customers. Perhaps the best
measure of IBM's success comes from the large systems integrators, who
regard IBM as a direct competitor.
IBM has long been the market leader in the PC sector, which it quickly
recognised as a big new market opportunity in the early 1980s. In the
computer workstation market, IBM has made a late, but remarkably successful
entry. Last year, the company sold Dollars 1bn-worth of its RS/60000
workstations, leaping from nowhere to become the fifth largest workstation
supplier. This year, IBM is expected to climb to number two or three in the
workstation market and by 1993 will be neck and neck with Sun Microsystems,
the market leader, according to industry analysts.
Digital Equipment is undergoing a painful metamorphosis. After suffering a
period of internal strife between supporters of open systems and
traditionalists, Digital is putting together a coherent strategy. Digital
maintains that open systems must incorporate proprietary software if the
promise of the open systems movement - inter-operability among dissimilar
computers - is to be fulfilled.
Standard proprietary systems which adhere to standards that allow
inter-operability, represent the way of the future, many in the industry
believe. Computers such as Digital's VAX would retain their distinct
features, but acquire the ability to work with other types or brands of
computers. HP, the third largest US computer company, has overhauled its
computer product line to take advantage of microprocessor power and to
respond to the open systems trend.
Similarly, NCR and Data General have developed aggressive open systems
strategies. Unisys, in spite of financial woes, is pursuing open systems. It
is too soon to count out the US computer industry leaders of the 1970s, but
it seems certain that they will be forced to concede a bigger share of the
market to the companies that emerged in the 1980s.

HEWLETT-PACKARD'S palmtop computer, introduced today, is the size of a
cheque book and weighs just 11 ounces but the HP 95LX packs all of the punch
of an IBM-compatible personal computer.
Built into the HP pocket-sized computer is Lotus 1-2-3, the most popular
spreadsheet program.
In addition, a phone book and appointments calendar comes installed into the
HP palmtop. Further programs can be loaded by inserting solid-state memory
cards. A plug-in demodulator unit enables the HP 95LX to receive text
messages from cellular paging systems.
It is aimed at technical and scientific users of its desktop PCs, and offers
the power of a machine 10 times its size.

the trend; Mobile Computers - The view from the US, Louise Kehoe in San

SINCE the early 1980s, when the desktop personal computer was still in its
infancy, there have been numerous attempts to create 'portable' versions of
PCs. Only recently, however, have semiconductor, data storage and display
technology advanced to the point where a fully-functional PC can be packaged
in a compact, lightweight, carry-along unit.
These technology advances are creating an increase in sales of laptop,
notebook and pocket computers, with world-wide sales expected to top Dollars
8bn this year.
The market for mobile computers has become one of the fastest growing
sectors of the computer business. The increase in mobile computer sales
comes as sales of desktop personal computers are beginning to sag,
particularly in the US.
By the mid-1990s, portable computers will represent close to 50 per cent of
all types of PCs sold, market analysts predict. In Japan, laptop computers
account for over 40 per cent of all PC sales. In Tokyo's crowded offices the
smaller laptop computers are widely used on the desktop.
Europe is also caught up in the mobile computer revolution with unit sales
expected to rise by over 30 per cent this year. Spurring much of this growth
is the new category of notebook computers - battery-powered machines that
are small enough to fit in a briefcase and weigh 8 lbs or less.
More than 840,000 notebook computers were sold in the US in 1990, according
to International Data, a research company. It predicts that sales could rise
to 1.4m units in 1991 and rise to 6.2m by the middle of the decade.
The US portable computer market has so far been dominated by Compaq Computer
and Tandy of the US, the Zenith DataSystems division of France's Groupe
Bull, and Japanese makers Toshiba and NEC.
However, over the past year, as many as 40 computer companies have announced
new portable computers.
Many have yet to deliver these products with delays blamed on shortages of
displays, disk-drives and microprocessors. Also entering the portable
computer fray are some of the largest US and European computer
manufacturers.
International Business Machines recently unveiled its notebook computer in
its third attempt to find a place in the portable computer market. The IBM
Personal System/2 L40 SX notebook computer is slightly larger and heavier
than most products in this category, but it is designed to provide the full
functionality of the current generation of desktop computers, whereas many
notebook computers compromise performance to achieve lower weight and price.
The IBM notebook features a full-size keyboard virtually identical to that
found on IBM's PS/2 desktop PCs; a standard memory of two megabytes and
maximum memory of 18 MB; a 60 MB hard drive and a 10-inch Video Graphics
Array (VGA) display. All this comes in a 7.7 lb package priced in the US at
Dollars 6,000.
The recent entry of IBM into the notebook computer market, and the
anticipated announcement by Apple Computer this year of notebook-sized
versions of its Macintosh computers are expected to expand sales rather than
to unseat established suppliers.
Digital Equipment, Unisys, NCR and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph are
expected to launch mobile computer products this year. Portability still
comes at a premium price, with most mobile computers up to 50 per cent more
than equivalent desktop machines. Competition is spurring price cuts with
some companies such as AST Research offering substantially lower prices on
notebook computers.
Technology advances are significantly expanding the capabilities of portable
computers.
Flat panel colour displays have recently been introduced by Toshiba and
other leading portable makers.
The portable computer of the future will incorporate 'wireless
communications' according to many industry experts. Last month, NEC of Japan
introduced one of the first portable computers with wireless communications.
The 6.6 lb laptop computer incorporates a radio transceiver which enables it
to send and receive messages without a phone line.
NEC is offering the wireless computer only in Japan. Leading US computer
makers also see radio communications becoming an important feature of
portable computers in the future.
Apple recently filed a petition with the US Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) that, if approved, would let computers transmit and receive
information over radio waves instead of through a wired network.
For today's users of portable computers, wireless communications represent a
potential solution to the difficulties of hooking portable computers up to
telephones. While desktop personal computers that incorporate a model
generally have their own phone line, the portable computer must be plugged
into a phone in whatever location the user finds himself.
Yet to be resolved is one of the toughest technical challenges of building
portable computers - short battery life. Although power-management systems
and low-power components have significantly extended computer battery life,
battery technology is advancing only slowly, computer makers complain.
A new category of PCs that is beginning to show promise is the hand-held or
pocket computer. This market has been pioneered by Poqet Computer of
Sunnyvale, California, whose 1.1 lb IBM-compatible PC fits easily into a
coat pocket or handbag. The Poqet has been picked up by Infonet, the
international value-added network provider, as a portable communications
terminal, for sending and receiving electronic mail and other types of
messages.
Mr Stav Prodromou, founder and vice-chairman of Poqet, sees pocket-sized
computers creating new types of PC applications. These tiny computers are so
unobtrusive, he suggests, that they could be used to take notes during a
meeting. Their light weight also makes them suitable for use as an
electronic appointments calendar or time organiser.
Also about to enter the hand-held computer market is Hewlett-Packard, which
this month will introduce a calculator-sized unit with a built-in version of
the popular Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet.
On the horizon is yet another new type of portable computers known as slate
computers. These notebook-sized devices will replace the familiar keyboard
with an electronic pen. The user will simply write on the 'slate' or point
to icons to select functions.
Numerous applications are envisaged for these pen-based computers among
people who do much of their work while standing or moving around. Doctors
and nurses might use them to update patients' notes or order tests, for
example.
Software that enables the computer to interpret hand-written notes has been
developed by Go Corporation, a California start-up. Microsoft, the leading
supplier of PC software, is also developing handwriting recognition software
that could be used as an extension of its existing PC operating systems.
Grid Systems, one of the pioneers of the portable computer market, offers a
slate computer with limited handwriting recognition capabilities. IBM and
Apple Computer have both expressed great interest in the potential for this
new technology. Market researchers at BIS Strategic Decisions predict that
sales of slate computers will top Dollars 1.5bn by 1995 and could become a
Dollars 7bn market by the end of the decade.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (2): Technology advance
drives sales growth; On-Line Transaction Processing - The view from the US,
Louise Kehoe in San Francisco assesses changing market strategies and
unveils a palmtop

ON-LINE transaction processing has grown to encompass a full third of world
computer market since its beginnings in airline reservation systems and
banking.
These interactive computer systems serve in a growing range of business
applications, from production management to customer service. With sales
last year of approximately Dollars 40bn worldwide, OLTP is growing at an
annual rate of about 20 per cent and will be a Dollars 72bn market by 1994,
according to market analysts.
Growth in the OLTP market is being driven by its broadening use in
telecommunications, manufacturing and retail industries, which have become
big users of OLTP. Technology advances in parallel processing and
microprocessor performance have downsized OLTP, creating applications and
making this mode of computing available to small and medium-sized businesses
as well as large corporations.
OLTP has been impacted by the trend toward open systems based upon the Unix
operating system. Unix-based OLTP will grow to between Dollars 18bn and
Dollars 21bn by 1994, according to Dataquest, the market research company.
The emergence of relational database management systems software has been a
driving force in the growth of OLTP. These programs, which enable users to
access information wherever it resides in a database, have become the basis
for a broad range of business applications running on OLTP systems.
'Fault tolerant', or 'high availability' computers represent an important
segment of the OLTP market. As businesses entrust their most critical
functions to computer systems, the reliability of the systems and their
ability to continue functioning through power failures, component failures,
software updates and all manner of events that can bring the average
computer to its knees has become vital.
Traditionally, OLTP systems have been based upon mainframe computers with
International Business Machines claiming the lion's share of the market. IBM
holds an estimated 55 per cent share of the OLTP market, largely based upon
its dominant role in mainframe computers. While IBM is expected to remain
the market leader, its share of the OLTP market will decline, according to
industry analysts, as microprocessor-based parallel processing systems -
many of them running the Unix operating system - displace traditional
mainframes.
Tandem Computers, pioneered the 'fault tolerant' computer market selling its
proprietary computers to banks and securities companies. Lower spending in
the financial services industries have hurt Tandem's earnings over the past
year but with 1990 revenues of Dollars 506.1bn the company remains the
market leader in fault-tolerant computers.
Last year, Tandem introduced its first open systems products, offering a
range of Unix computers based upon Mips Computers Reduced Instruction Set
Computer (RISC) chips. In addition to selling its Unix computers direct to
end users, Tandem signed an agreement with A T &amp; T under which the
telecommunications and computing company will resell the Tandem products.
Biting at the heels of IBM and Tandem are a new generation of specialist
OLTP computer companies led by Stratus Computer, Sequent Computer Systems
and Pyramid Technology. Stratus specialises in what it terms 'critical
on-line computing' or high availability computing for mission critical
applications.
Stratus's stronghold is in the financial services industry where it provides
systems for stock trading, automatic teller networks and credit card
authorisation. Stratus is, however, expanding its customer base in other
fields such as retailing, manufacturing and telecommunications.
Stratus recently launched a new product line based upon Intel's 860 Reduced
Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessor, following a trend toward
the use of high performance RISC processors in OLTP. The company is also
making a transition from a proprietary operating system to open systems
based upon the Unix operating system.
Some 20 per cent of Stratus's Dollars 404m 1990 revenues came via IBM, which
sells Stratus computers on an OEM basis. Over the past year, however,
Stratus's business with IBM has flattened as IBM increasingly targets
'mission critical' applications with its own computers.
Stratus expects to expand its direct sales to more than compensate for the
IBM shortfall. The company is in particular targeting the emerging market
lligent networks' as deregulated telephone companies offer new services such
as store and forward facsimile, free-phone numbers and voice messaging
services.
Sequent Computer Systems' products, based upon the Intel line of
microprocessors running a version of the Unix operating system, demonstrate
the price and performance advantages that microprocessor-based parallel
processing has over traditional mainframes.
Sequent's Symmetry 2000 family of computers, introduced in January,
incorporates up to 30 of Intel's latest 486 microprocessors and achieves
mainframe class performance at what the company claims is an 80 per cent
price/performance advantage over other Unix mainframe computers and an even
greater edge over traditional proprietary mainframes.
The 8-year-old Sequent, with 1990 revenues of Dollars 249m, has built its
business upon automating applications that cannot be cost-effectively
handled by a mainframe computer. Examples range from a currency management
system for British Airways to an emergency room scheduling system for a
California hospital.
Pyramid Technology, another OLTP specialist, achieved a remarkable 73 per
cent growth in revenues in fiscal 1990, to reach Dollars 180m for the year
ending last September. Pyramid, of the Silicon Valley, is about to launch a
range of products based upon Mips Computer's RISC microprocessors.
While the niche players of the OLTP market are making inroads, the big
companies of the computer industry are not standing still. Unisys,
traditionally a large supplier of mainframe-based OLTP and also a re-seller
of Sequent computers, last week unveiled hardware and software products that
establish its strategic direction toward open-systems based OLTP.
Unisys expanded its product line with mid-range systems, which it will
manufacture in-house. Based on the Intel 486 with up to five processors, the
new Unisys 6000/65 has a peak performance of 118 MIPs and will run the
latest version of A T &amp; T's Unix, System V4.
Unisys also unveiled new Unix OLTP software including an improved version of
A T &amp; T's 'transaction manager' which will improve performance and
reliability, the company claims.
Digital Equipment's OLTP revenues grew by approximately 35 per cent to
Dollars 2.1bn in 1990, according to analysts at Hambrecht &amp; Quist, the San
Francisco investment bank.
Digital is emphasising fault tolerance. DEC launched its first specifically
fault-tolerant computers early last year but according to industry analysts
the products failed to have a significant impact on the market.
Last month, DEC unveiled its second generation fault tolerant products - a
new range of aggressively-priced VAX minicomputers designed for mission
critical applications which analysts predict will do much better.
Hewlett-Packard is also taking a stab at the fail-safe computer market
through an investment in Sequoia Systems, a small manufacturer of
fault-tolerant computers.
HP will resell Sequoia's machines and gain access to its technology. As
competition mounts, the OLTP market will become increasingly segmented,
analysts predict. Increasingly, the ability to perform OLTP will become a
prerequisite of commercial computing systems or all sizes.

FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (1): On the brink of
disaster - The effects of recent changes in the computer industry have been
shattering for many companies. Almost every mainframe or minicomputer
manufacturer in the US and Europe is demonstrating declining profitability,
if not actual losses. Alan Cane reports

<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S large computer manufacturers have become used to rehearsing the
superficial reasons for the present crisis in the information technology
business, a malaise which has brought many of the best-known names in data
processing to the brink of disaster.
These include:
The spread of open systems, computer networks based on standard industry
components which cannot command the gross profit margins inherent in
proprietary designs. The gross margin built into a mainframe computer sale
can be 70 per cent or more; for PCs and workstations, it can be less than 30
per cent.
A seemingly never-ending decline in the cost and growth in the power of data
processing equipment which has further squeezed manufacturer's margins. A
high performance workstation can cost less than Dollars 1,000 for every
million instructions per second (mips) of computer power. Mainframes
typically cost more than Dollars 100,000 per mips. For many, but not all,
tasks it is possible to substitute low cost workstation power for mainframe
power.
The growing importance of service suppliers and systems integrators who put
together hardware and software from disparate sources to satisfy their
customers' requirements. New competitors for the traditional industry as a
result of this change include management consultancies such Anderson
Consulting and Price Waterhouse as well as software houses and value added
resellers.
A slackening in demand for computer systems which has been apparent in the
US for some time and is becoming evident in Europe. The reasons are complex;
they include saturation in some areas of the market, dissatisfaction with
the results of continued computerisation and, in the UK at least, high
interest rates.
The effects of these changes have been shattering for many companies. In the
US, Unisys, the result of a merger between Sperry and Burroughs only five
years old, lost Dollars 436.7m in 1990 and suspended payment of dividends on
both its common and preferred stock in an attempt to reduce debt which stood
at Dollars 3.7bn at the end of that year.
In Europe, Groupe Bull, the French state-owned manufacturer announced a loss
of Pounds 700m for 1990 and said the French government had agreed to provide
Pounds 400m in capital support to the company over 1991-92 in addition to
Pounds 270m earmarked for research and development into Bull's open systems
designs.
Unisys and Bull are simply the most spectacular victims of the sickness
affecting the industry; almost every mainframe or minicomputer company in
the US and Europe is demonstrating declining profitability if not actual
losses.
Earnings per share at IBM, the world's largest computer company, for
example, have been on a plateau for six years now. The company has spent
more time and money than most over the past three years in attempting to
bring its expenses into line with sales, but earlier this month it shook the
stock market with a warning that its sales in the first quarter of 1991
would be significantly weaker than expected; Wall Street analysts were
downcast after the company's apparently strong recovery in 1990.
The key to what is happening is the uneven nature of the picture. Suppliers
of PCs, workstations and high powered small systems have not been damaged to
anything like the same extent as mainframe and minicomputer manufacturers.
Compaq Computer, for example, the world leader in high powered PCs reported
sales in 1990 of Dollars 3.6bn, up 25 per cent from 1989, while net income
was Dollars 455m, up from Dollars 333m the previous year. Its growth was
chiefly driven by international sales, up 54 per cent, while revenues grew
only 5 per cent in the US.
Apple Computer, a PC pioneer which has tended to go its own way in
technological development, had comparatively stagnant sales and earnings in
1990, but began a spectacular turnaround after the launch of new,
aggressively priced computers featuring its proprietary 'Macintosh'
technology.
Pyramid Technology of the US which makes high performance mid-range
computers using the 'Unix' operating system increased revenues by 93 per
cent last year and its pre-tax profits by 110 per cent. The Pyramid machines
are colloquially described as 'Unix hot boxes'; for prices between Pounds
34,000 and Pounds 500,000, they will outperform a mainframe. Other hot box
suppliers include Arix and Sequent.
New players are entering the industry, often from unexpected directions.
Nippon Steel, for example, the world's largest steelmaking concern has
developed notebook computers which it is marketing in the US and Europe as
part of a broad plan to diversify into computers and communications.
All of this is evidence that the traditional computer business is being
displaced by a new industry, with which it has little in common, as surely
as the traditional Swiss watching making industry was brushed aside by
Japanese electronic timepiece manufacturers.
This new computer industry has its origin not in traditional data processing
but in the semiconductor industry and its expression in PCs and
workstations.
The traditional industry is characterised by proprietary computer designs
which lock customers into individual suppliers; prices are set to yield high
gross profit margins which are used to finance substantial direct sales
forces. These are the primary conduits between the manufacturer and the
customer. Applications software is developed chiefly by the customer's own
software staff, perhaps with the help of a software house.
The new industry is very different. Machine designs are similar between
suppliers because they are based on widely available, industry standard
microprocessors. Most of the research and development work has been carried
out by the semiconductor manufacturer. Compaq, for example, spends about
half the industry average on research and development.
Because margins are so narrow, direct sales forces are economically unviable
and sales take place principally through 'channels' - dealers, software
houses, value added resellers and systems integrators. The key to success,
as in the case of Compaq, is a strong positive relationship with the
channel.
Operating software is standard - usually a variation of the Unix system.
Applications software is packaged, developed by software specialists who
prefer to write programs which will run on a wide variety of machines rather
than tie themselves to a single manufacturer.
The question, therefore, is whether the members of the old industry are
sufficiently flexible to become new industry players, or whether they are
doomed to extinction. Against this background, arguments about the value of
state aid to national champions appear increasingly redundant.
At present, most experts agree that only IBM is safe; it has the
determination, flexibility and, most important, the financial security to
change course decisively.
The future of the Japanese mainframe manufacturers, Fujitsu, Hitachi and
NEC, IBM's chief competitors is unclear. They continue to prosper in their
fast growing home market, but have yet to face the challenge of open systems
and networked computing which is causing their Western competitors so much
heartache.
Swiss watchmakers found salvation in fashion. An equivalent safe haven for
the traditional computer industry is not yet in sight.

FT  23 APR 91 / (CORRECTED) Survey of The Computer Industry (11): Take your
partners and consolidate - UK, an industry still to be reckoned with
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 25th April 1991) appended to this article.
THE British computer industry is not what it once was.
International Computers Limited (ICL) is owned by Fujitsu, Apricot has sold
its computer hardware division to Mitsubishi, Sinclair Research is now part
of Mr Alan Sugar's Amstrad computer organisation and Acorn Computers has
long been part of the large Olivetti empire.
That does not mean that it is no longer a force to be reckoned with. Not
only have some British computer companies, notably Amstrad, survived the
market consolidations of the 1980s, but leading international manufacturing
facilities have come to the UK.
In addition, smaller, home-grown companies with innovative hardware and
software products, such as London-based Psion, have built their own
specialist markets.
This has taken place against a background of declining government investment
in high technology, the opening up of European markets in preparation for
1992 and the push for development of open computer systems.
ICL, for example, has been behind a push in both the public and private
sector over the past few years to encourage the use and evolution of
standard, open computer systems in the powerful mid-range and high-end mini
and mainframe sectors.
However, it seems that the open systems aren't always good news for UK
computer interests. According to Mr Tim Taylor, marketing director of
ACT-Logsys, it is open systems which played a large part in inducing Apricot
to sell its hardware division to Mitsubishi.
ACT-Logsys, a new company formed from a part of Apricot which was not sold
off, specialises in consultancy and support for large public and private
sector clients.
'One of the reasons we decided to find a partner for Apricot hardware was
that with standardisation and globalisation, it was getting much harder for
a UK supplier to survive on a worldwide scale,' says Mr Taylor.
That search for a partner eventually led to Mitsubishi buying the company.
He adds that the drive for standards has somewhat levelled the technology
playing field and is forcing many of the smaller players to move into
specialist markets to survive.
Ironically, as computer companies founded by British nationals have either
been sold or folded, international companies, such as Compaq Computer and
Connor Peripherals have moved in to take their places.
Compaq, in particular, has seen a spectacular rise to success for its UK
company - headed by Mr Joe McNally, UK-born managing director. Mr McNally
says that, in many ways, Compaq in the UK is just as much of a British
company as ICL had been.
Compaq has spent more than Dollars 76m on its Scottish manufacturing
facility in the past three years. Compaq has built up an annual UK turnover
in excess of Dollars 1bn thanks largely to a combination of the revenues
generated by the factory and the company's sales in the UK.
It was perhaps a sign of the times when Compaq found wholehearted and very
senior UK government support for location of the factory in Scotland -
although other Compaq European subsidiaries were lobbying heavily to have it
elsewhere.
Mr McNally recalls fondly one of the main elements in finally clinching the
deal to build in Scotland.
'Former prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher personally put pen to paper and
wrote to our US chairman Mr Rod Canion,' says Mr McNally.
'That played an important role in terms of him deciding to come here -
although we did have a lot of support from the government and the Locate in
Scotland office,' adds Mr McNally.
He suggests that investing as heavily as it has in the UK has produced a
lift in sales to public sector bodies, which have in the past largely turned
to Apricot for their personal computers.
He says that public sector sales for Compaq in the rest of Europe account
for only 8 per cent of its business. In the UK, that figure has recently
risen to 18 per cent.
'Clearly the Scottish factory has been an influence,' he suggests. But while
Compaq is enjoying the benefits of increased public sector and corporate
sales, the recession has hit the lower end of the PC industry hard,
particularly in the retail sector.
IBM-compatible PCs have become commodity consumer electronics products and
suffer the same ups and downs as home fax systems, stereos and satellite
television. Amstrad, British electronics company, for example, is feeling
the bite of the recession.
'Business is not very good at the moment, but everyone is suffering,' admits
Mr Alan Sugar, Amstrad founder and chairman. 'But that's no consolation.
It's been bloody slow and probably will be for the next six or seven months
 -even if interest rates drop 2 or 3 per cent. It was a bad January and
February and the satellite business suffered in February. Things are
starting to move again, but not in the volumes we had before Christmas,' he
says.
Mr Sugar, however, has bounced back many times before and is expected to
weather this recession well. At last month's CeBIT exhibition in Germany, he
bullishly announced three new products - designed to help lift his share of
the portables and small desktop computer markets and to pioneer
participation in the colour laptop computing sector.
Correction (published 25th April 1991).
IN TUESDAY'S computer industry survey, we suggested incorrectly that
Sinclair Research was part of the Amstrad organisation. In 1986, Amstrad
purchased the right to use the Sinclair trade name together with Sinclair's
intellectual property rights, patents and stocks of home computers. Sir
Clive Sinclair, however, retained ownership of Sinclair Research.

FT  22 APR 91 / Tunisia counts the cost of the Gulf war: Loss of tourism has
dealt a serious blow to the ailing economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GULF war has dealt a sharp blow to the economy of Tunisia.
The loss of foreign income from tourism and decline in domestic employment
come at a time when industrial growth had been resuming after three years of
drought, locust plagues and severe austerity.
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has pushed through measures aimed at
liberalising the management of Tunisia's economy, while maintaining
austerity.
A budget deficit equivalent to 8 per cent of gross domestic product in 1986
was turned into a surplus of 4 per cent last year but the Ministry of
Planning forecasts no increase in the country's GDP this year.
The government recognises that austerity is all the more necessary today and
has gone ahead with plans to cut five days' pay from all salaried workers.
The government expects exports of goods and services to suffer a shortfall
of TD850m (Dollars 895m), a figure which rises to more than TD1bn if the
loss of loans from Arab funds is included.
This year could turn out to be the first since independence when the number
of job losses is greater than the number of new jobs. The Ministry of
Planning estimates that 51,600 jobs will be lost and 48,000 created - this
at a time when 55,000 young Tunisians are entering the labour market every
year.
The social repercussions are grave. Ever more violent confrontations between
the police and Islamic fundamentalist militants from the major opposition
party, En Nahda (The Renaissance) has led to a climate in which the promises
of greater freedom of expression which accompanied President Ben Ali's
assumption of power have all but disappeared.
The fallout from the war is expected to cost the balance of payments TD600m.
The Tunisian government was quick to react and, three months ago, seized the
opportunity of a routine IMF review of the country's position to activate
the enlarged facility it had arranged with the Fund in 1988, but never drawn
down.
The IMF is expected to agree to Tunisia drawing SDR138m (Dollars 190m) - a
sum equivalent to its quota with the Fund.
Preliminary government estimates give loss of export income and suggest
three sectors will be badly affected:
Tourism and transport where half of Tunis Air's fleet is grounded - TD470m.
This figure is predicated on a 50 per cent decline in foreign visitors
during the first six months of the year; Exports of goods - TD330m of which
one third is accounted for by textiles;
Transfer payments - TD50m, the bulk of which are remittances from Tunisians
working abroad.
To these figures must be added the loss of TD200m worth of loans from
Kuwaiti and Arab development funds which will lead to the delay of major
projects.
A lower volume of imported capital goods and the decline in local spending
will cut the import bill by TD350m, but this will still add TD600m to
initial estimates of the balance of payments deficit.
The domestic economic consequences of the Gulf war will thus be severe,
despite the fact that an exceptionally plentiful rainfall should deliver a
very good crop, thus reducing the need to import cereals. This would be all
the more welcome as US aid has been cut by three-quarters.
The US Congress appeared somehat disgruntled at Tunisia's refusal to join
the coalition against Iraq. The benefits Morocco drew from sending troops to
the Gulf stand in sharp contrast - Saudi Arabia gave King Hassan Dollars
700m last autumn.
Although most sectors of the economy have felt the repercussions of the Gulf
war, tourism has been one of the immediate casualties. It accounts for
one-fifth of foreign earnings and ensures the livelihood of 800,000 people.
To a net loss of 13,500 jobs must be added the pressure on hotel owners to
shed labour if the number of foreign visitors does not pick up fast. In the
transport sector, job losses will amount to 2,700.
The construction industry is also likely to be affected since many new
hotels (Tunisia adds 5,000 beds every year) will not get the go-ahead.
The manufacturing sector, where only a third of the 15,000 new jobs planned
for 1991 will be created, could be further hit by an economic slowdown among
major client countries such as France.
The Tunisian government has been quick to draw up a list of capital
expenditure cuts and increase the price of certain items such as petrol.
If tourism picks up faster than expected, the government will be spared the
worse. If public frustration grows, however, the risks of social and
political unrest will be only too clear.

FT  22 APR 91 / Sun Alliance lends Aldington Pounds 500,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUN ALLIANCE insurance company, the UK's biggest household insurer, will
disclose in its annual report and accounts today that it has given an
interest-free loan, estimated at Pounds 500,000, to Lord Aldington, its
former chairman.
The loan is to cover the legal costs of his nine-week libel case against
Count Nikolai Tolstoy in 1989.
The directors justify the decision on the grounds that the case arose from
his duties as the company's chairman.
Earlier this month Sun Alliance reported a 1990 loss of Pounds 181m due to
claims arising from bad weather and the recession.
The loan to Lord Aldington is repayable if he recovers costs. The legal bill
has been estimated at Pounds 500,000 plus other expenses of about Pounds
100,000.
The company says that Mr Nigel Watts, a Kent property developer and a
co-defendant in the libel action, had claimed that Sun Alliance wrongly
refused to pay a Pounds 50,000 accident policy after his brother-in-law died
in 1975.
At the trial Lord Aldington's counsel said there had been a 'disgraceful
campaign' to force Sun Alliance to reverse its decision over the insurance
claim.
The court was told Mr Watts had circulated 10,000 copies of a pamphlet,
written by Count Tolstoy, attacking Lord Aldington's war record.
It alleged that as a senior officer in Austria at the end of the Second
World War he repatriated thousands of Cossacks and anti-Tito Yugoslavs to
the Communists knowing they faced torture and death.
At the end of the trial Lord Aldington, a former deputy chairman of the
Conservative party, was awarded record Pounds 1.5m damages plus costs but
neither Count Tolstoy nor Mr Watts were able to pay that sum.

FT  22 APR 91 / Economics Notebook: A challenging descent from heaven
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WHEN Mr Detlev Rohwedder
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
assassinated head of the Treuhand agency charged with privatising East
German industry - resigned as state secretary of the German Economics
Ministry in 1980, he left to run a steel company.
As announced last week, Sir Peter Middleton, who is resigning as permanent
secretary of the UK Treasury next month, will move to the City as a director
and deputy chairman of the Barclays Bank group and to head Barclays'
newly-formed markets and investment banking division.
Once in the Square Mile, he will be rubbing shoulders with other ex-Treasury
knights. Sir Geoffrey Littler, one of Sir Peter's former deputies, was
appointed last week to be chairman of NatWest Investment Bank. Sir Douglas
Wass, Sir Peter's immediate predecessor as permanent secretary, is
co-chairman of Nomura International.
The amakudari, or 'descent from heaven', of these eminent gentlemen will
doubtless gild their final working years. But what does it tell us about
Britain, and is it good news for the country?
Just as Downing Street was announcing Sir Peter's departure from the
Treasury, the Confederation of British Industry reported a sharp fall in
industry's research and development since 1988.
The report showed that industry-funded R&amp;D in Britain, in proportion to
output, was about half Japanese and German levels.
The coincidence of these two news items gives powerful backing to an
argument put forward earlier this year by Mr Walter Eltis, the director
general of the National Economic Development Office*, to the effect that
Britain's poor investment record in manufacturing and fragile international
competitiveness can be partly linked to too great a concentration of
national effort in the areas of finance and banking.
Mr Eltis cited figures showing that investment in financial services in
Britain rose 313 per cent in volume terms between 1979 and 1990 while
investment in manufacturing barely rose at all. In the 11 years, financial
sector investment as a share of total investment in plant and machinery rose
to 29.4 per cent from 11.7 per cent.
But while the UK had put a 'great many eggs into the financial basket', the
recent history of UK banking had exposed miscalculations and weaknesses such
as the catalogue of loss-making decisions at the Midland Bank.
Mr Eltis concluded that excessive inflation, poor real rates of return and a
pro-housing bias in the UK's financial institutions had also crimped
investment. But 'the impact on the direction of investment of an apparently
hyper-profitable City, the superiority of which now appears in part
illusory' was a factor.
Worryingly, Mr Eltis suggests that the recent woes in UK banking and
insurance cast doubt over the ability of Britain's financial sector to reap
the promised harvest of the Europrean single market. It will be up to Sir
Peter Middleton and the other mature madarins who make a bee-line for the
City to prove him wrong.
****
A bias in favour of finance is not an exclusively British preserve. When Mr
Jacques Attali, the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, sought a vehicle to turn his vision of a united European
economic area stretching from the Urals to the coast of Portugal into
reality, he thought of a bank.
At last week's inauguration of the EBRD in London, there were plenty of
people suggesting that a better way of helping eastern and central Europe
move to democracy and develop the market economy would be for the west to
lower trade barriers to products in which the former communist countries
have a comparative advantage.
In Washington last week, the Czechoslovak foreign minister Mr Jiri
Dienstbier was giving the same message to President George Bush.
The progress being made towards reaching association agreements between the
European Community and Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia shows that the EC
is responding to these pressures. In London last week, Mr Henning
Christophersen, an EC Commission member, acknowledged that the former
communist states 'had no real economic prospects' without free access to the
industrial world's markets.
This view was echoed by Mr Attali, who said the EBRD would prepare a
strategy for opening up trade relations between east and west. What this
would entail was unclear, however. Like much else concerning the business
operations of the EBRD, it is a question of wait and see.
****
Is the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ripe for
expansion? A South Korean delegation will visit the OECD this week for talks
about joining the 24-nation Paris-based economic think tank of
industrialised countries.
Mexico is also a likely candidate, while several east European countries
have also expressed an interest in joining.
New members are only admitted to the club with the unanimous agreement of
existing members. South Korea's human rights record could pose problems. But
it is a member of the EBRD which has the promotion of pluralism and
democracy among its goals.

FT  22 APR 91 / G7 meeting will expose interest rate splits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIFFERENCES ON interest rates have opened a division among the Group of
Seven industrialised countries which some officials say may be as wide as at
any time since the group began economic policy co-ordination in 1985.
The differing views, which will surface on Sunday at a meeting of G7 finance
ministers and central bank governors in Washington, stem from a US desire to
see lower global interest rates to tackle what it sees as a growing risk of
worldwide recession.
'Next Sunday will probably be the occasion where disagreement on the
emphasis of future economic policy among the G7 will be the most noticeable
of any recent meeting,' a senior European monetary official said.
According to a US administration official, the US believes that the 'balance
of risks' between inflation and global recession has shifted. This is
against a background of an uncertain US recovery from recession and
weakening economic growth in Germany and Japan.
'We must emphasise the importance of growth at this point because most of
the global problems . . . would be more manageable if there is global
growth,' said the US official. These problems included the economic
reconstruction of eastern Europe and Latin America, and German unification.
In a clear reference to tight German monetary policy, he said there was a
need for a 'global perspective' among those economic policymakers who
appeared now to be concerned with purely domestic issues. The suggestion was
that high German interest rates were keeping real - inflation-adjusted -
interest rates at unusually high levels in other countries.
When the US first raised the issue, at an informal meeting of G7 finance
ministers in London eight days ago, there was sympathy for the US stance
from France and Italy, while Japan appeared to remain neutral in the
discussion.
However, the US position is strongly opposed by the UK, Germany and Canada,
which believe that the chief concern of international policy should remain
the curbing of inflation, which in turn will spark economic recovery as real
purchasing power is restored. They say experience shows the dangers of
premature policy relaxation. British officials have reiterated this position
forcefully even after the jump in UK unemployment reported last week.
Their fear is that the US stance is being taken for domestic political
motives, as part of efforts to encourage the US Federal Reserve to ease
interest rates to provide a firm economic backdrop for the run-up to the US
presidential election in November next year. While the US is emphasising
that it continues to desire low inflation, opponents worry that the US is
once more raising the discredited notion of a trade-off between inflation
and recession.

FT  22 APR 91 / Growth seen for final quarter of 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, ALAN PIKE and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST BRITISH industrialists do not expect economic growth to resume until
the final three months of this year, and when the recovery arrives it will
be very gradual.
That sober assessment of the economic outlook among leading industrialists
will be confirmed this week by two business surveys.
The industrialists' prognosis - which has emerged from recent company
reporting for 1990 - was borne out by mixed economic indicators in the past
week, suggesting the economy is delicately poised between fragile recovery
and continuing recession.
The first signs of a thaw in the housing market, with housebuilders
reporting rising sales and faint glimmers of a recovery in the high street,
were offset by a steep fall in bank lending for March and a record monthly
rise in unemployment to more than 2m.
The Engineering Employers Federation will this week raise its forecast for
job losses in the year ahead and predict that a discernible recovery will be
delayed until the middle of next year. The Association of British Chambers
of Commerce quarterly survey published this week will report a rise in
business confidence offset by recent falls in output, home orders and
investment among its 8,000 members.
The CBI's annual survey of innovation will show that almost 40 per cent of
companies regard this investment in innovation as inadequate.
Mr Gary Allen, chief executive of IMI, the Midlands engineering group,
summed up the caution about the economic prospects: 'For us the earliest an
upturn can come is the final quarter of the year.'
Mr Bruce Farmer, chief executive of Morgan Crucible, the industrial
materials manufacturer said: 'There are the first signs of growth trickling
through the dam of recession, but it is a trickle.'
According to Mr David Lees, chairman and chief executive of GKN, the
automotive components group, trading conditions weakened in the first months
of the year. The car industry is concerned that tax changes introduced in
the Budget may stifle recovery later this year.
Mr Sid Taylor, chief operating officer of TI, the specialist engineering
products group, said: 'The UK will remain very tough this year.'
Manufacturers hope a resurgence of US business confidence following the Gulf
war, combined with continuing growth in Germany, will help lead the UK out
of recession.
Today's FT-CBI distributive trades survey suggests a weak rally in trade may
be under way, with sales in March above last year's levels. However,
retailers are concerned the rally may have been caused by consumers seeking
to beat the April 1 rise in VAT from 15 per cent to 17.5 per cent.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI distributive trades panel, said:
'The prospects indicate that there could be a slow and gradual recovery,
tempered by rising unemployment and relatively high interest rates.'

FT  22 APR 91 / GM to challenge Fiat in Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS of the US, the world's largest car maker, is set to challenge
Fiat of Italy's leading role in the development of the Polish car industry.
GM has completed a feasibility study into car assembly in Poland and is
expected to begin negotiations with the government and with FSO, the
Warsaw-based, state-owned car maker within a month.
The US group, which controls more than 12 per cent of the western European
car market through its Opel (Vauxhall in the UK) and Saab marques, is
considering an investment of about Dollars 100m (Pounds 58m) to establish an
assembly operation for 30,000-50,000 cars a year at part of the existing FSO
facility. The operation would involve two or three shifts.
GM, with Volkswagen and Fiat, has led moves by western car makers into
eastern Europe.
It is establishing a car plant at Eisenach, eastern Germany, and engine,
small-volume car assembly and components operations in Hungary.
The GM project will compete with a more far-reaching plan proposed by Fiat
to reorganise the entire Polish car industry, including both state-owned
manufacturers, FSO and FSM.
The US group is understood to be considering assembly of both its Opel
Kadett/Vauxhall Astra and Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier ranges in Warsaw.
The project would be expected to attract automotive components suppliers to
establish operations in Poland.
The GM assembly plan would be aimed at replacing FSO's antiquated assembly
operation of the FSO 125, an outdated Fiat design which stems from a 1965
licensing agreement with the Italian group. Production of the Polski Fiat
125 began in 1968.
The Polish car industry has been based on licensed Fiat designs, with the
production of the 125 and the Polonez hatchback at FSO in Warsaw and the
Fiat 126 mini car at the FSM plant in Bielsko Biala, Silesia.
Fiat is already firmly entrenched at the more modern FSM plant, which begins
production later this year of a new generation small Fiat, the Cinquecento
(500). About L1,000bn (Pounds 450m) has been invested for development and to
modernise the FSM plant.
Fiat's plan, put to the Polish government last year, to modernise and
rationalise the Polish auto industry, included:
Creation of a holding company encompassing the operations of FSM and FSO,
the two state car makers, in which Fiat would take the role of 'strategic
investor'.
The building of engine and gearbox plants.
A licensing agreement for the assembly of the Fiat Tipo at the FSO plant in
Warsaw.
It is understood that elements in the Polish government and FSO are keen to
promote the talks with GM.
The Polish car market totalled about 285,000 last year, and although sales
are expected to fall to some 200,000 annually this year and next, GM
forecasts sales of about 400,000 a year by 1999.

FT  22 APR 91 / ERM Part Two, or Virtue Unrewarded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a time when Britain's entry into the exchange rate mechanism (ERM)
could be satisfyingly rationalised in terms of 17th century drama. Former
chancellor Nigel Lawson, with abundant locks and wayward monetary habits,
was clearly the cavalier of the piece; Margaret Thatcher, the shocked
puritan dame; and John Major, the roundhead from Huntingdon, the hero who
led the charge for anti-inflationary virtue.
Unfortunately, something has gone wrong with the denouement. Not only is
monetary virtue largely unrewarded at the opinion polls in the run-up to the
local elections in May, but Mr Major's puritan credentials (and educational
qualifications) are being questioned. Worse, vice has triumphed within the
semi-fixed exchange rate system itself. As my colleague Anthony Harris
pointed out here last week, the D-Mark threatens to join the French franc at
the bottom of the currency grid, while the high-inflation cavaliers -
Britain, Italy and Spain - are seeing their currencies propelled powerfully
upwards. Where is the discipline, or rather virtue, in the system now?
The conundrum is not entirely new. And since many have difficulty grasping
why the natural order in this morality play has been turned upside down it
will do no harm to recapitulate some recent history. Last summer, when Mr
Major was busily talking up sterling before Britain's entry into the ERM, it
was widely recognised that putting cavaliers into a club run by puritans
would result in a transitional problem. As long as the Bundesbank was
perceived as a guarantor of price stability for the system as a whole,
international investors would flock to the currencies of the weaker
countries on the basis that the reduction or elimination of currency risk
made their higher interest rates attractive.
The weak would thus come under pressure to relax monetary policy
prematurely. But ultimately, after a blip or two, interest rates across the
system could be expected to converge, in the same way that French and German
rates had done, as a preliminary to wider economic convergence. The
underlying assumption was that convergence would take place around a German
norm.
That assumption suddenly looks more shaky in the light of turbulence in the
Soviet Union, huge unemployment in the former East Germany, the mother of
German fiscal deficits and a strong dollar. Even last year there was some
worry that the Bundesbank's anti-inflationary zeal might be diluted on the
way to European monetary union (EMU). Now there is an added internal threat
arising from the battle over the composition of the Bundesbank's council.
Some fear that presidents of the new Lander banks in the east will be more
susceptible to political pressure for looser monetary policy and that, if
Bundesbank president Karl Otto Pohl fails to win support from Chancellor
Kohl for his plan for a smaller council, the influence of the men from
Frankfurt will be weakened. In short, the market has a nasty suspicion that
convergence might come about as much from the German rate of inflation
moving up as the other members' moving down.
The resulting pressure on the D-Mark helps explain why the British have been
able to reduce interest rates four times in two months and why any further
rise in German rates is unlikely to be followed by the rest of the ERM. But
that does not mean that the system no longer exerts any discipline. The
dramatic rise in Britain's unemployment figures last week suggests that
employers have grasped that the disparity between Britain's high unit wage
costs and much lower costs in Germany can no longer be addressed through
devaluation.
Exchange rate discipline is thus being built into expectations, though in a
tragically one-sided way. Workers no more look at the ERM grid when they
bargain over pay than they looked at sterling M3 in the monetarist
experiment of the early 1980s (when the money supply was actually a more
misleading indicator of the stance of policy than the exchange rate is now).
The other discipline that was not present in the early 1980s, or indeed
earlier, was that of high, positive real rates of interest, which are now
universal across the ERM. For over-borrowed British property companies that
cannot restore profitability by sacking workers because they have no workers
to sack, that implies that their finances will continue to deteriorate even
if the property market stabilises. They and other heavy corporate borrowers
are in a debt trap from which inflation no longer provides the exit that it
did after the crash of the mid-1970s.
The escape routes have also been closed at a national level, most notably
for Italy. A peculiarity of the Italian economy has been that Italy's
penchant for high public spending has been financed much less by personal
taxation, for which the citizens have a formidable aversion, than by
borrowing; and the public sector's IOUs have been absorbed by an
exceptionally thrifty personal sector on which the government was able to
impose negative real returns thanks to exchange controls.
There was a certain efficiency to the arrangement, in that Italy avoided the
high tax collection costs incurred by other countries. But it depended
heavily on the inflation tax continuing to reduce or eliminate real
borrowing costs. Now that has gone; the public sector's outstanding debt is
larger than the country's own GNP; and there are additional problems with
wage indexation. Small wonder Moody's, the rating agency, has just put
Italy's triple A debt rating under review.
The irony in this particular commedia is that Italy should have been in the
forefront of the drive for EMU when the state of its public finances poses
one of the biggest obstacles to achieving EMU. But such ambivalence is the
essence of dramatic tension. The curious thing is that the authors of the
wider European monetary piece have no notion of how the inner contradictions
of the ERM and EMU will be resolved in the final act. All we know for
certain is that Karl Otto Pohl is the one undisputed roundhead in the drama.
Can he hold the line when the cavaliers come over the hill?

FT  22 APR 91 / No alternative to a policy of rigour: Reaction to the
current recession shows the strength of the consensus on economic policy in
France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are three remarkable features in the current slowdown in the French
economy. The first is that most economic forecasters believe France is now
in a recession, which has arrived with surprising abruptness. The second is
that it has failed to provoke any significant demand for a change of
economic policy, let alone any general campaign for reflation.
And the third, therefore, is that it seems to demonstrate how deeply the
French are now conditioned by the consensus that there is no alternative to
their existing anti-inflationary strategy of economic rigour.
In four short months the diagnosis of the French economy has shifted from
slowdown to recession. Two years ago it was bursting with vitality, with
growth of 3.7 per cent. Last year the growth rate slowed to 2.8 per cent,
but the government was still counting on 2.7 per cent for 1991.
By last December the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) forecast for French growth in 1991 was down to 2.3 per cent. At the
beginning of this year the government was still forecasting 2.2 per cent
growth, but in its current economic assessment it has trimmed that figure
back to a round 2 per cent. Yet the most recent evaluation by the National
Statistical Institute (INSEE) now reckons on growth of no more than 1.5 per
cent.
The slowdown is likely to lead to a fresh upswing in unemployment recent
years, remains one of the highest among leading OECD countries, after Italy
and Spain. After peaking at 10.5 per cent in 1987, the unemployment rate
declined very slowly to just under 9 per cent in the middle of last year.
Thereafter it levelled out, and in the early months of this year it has
started to edge up again, to 9.2 per cent, or a total of just over 2.5m.
From a political point of view, this is one of the most sensitive aspects of
the recession. And yet there is effectively no discussion of a reflationary
option as an answer to the unemployment problem; quite the contrary.
The slowdown in economic activity is inevitably being accompanied by a
decline in tax revenues, and the fiscal shortfall is likely to be
exacerbated by a rise in payments of unemployment benefit and minimum income
allowances. But the government's response to the shortfall is a renewed
determination at all costs to stick to its target budget deficit of FFr80bn
(Pounds 7.9bn) for this year. Accordingly, Mr Michel Rocard, the prime
minister, has imposed government spending cuts of FFr10bn, plus an
additional cut in investment programmes.
None of the conservative opposition parties has challenged the logic of Mr
Rocard's decision. Within the rank and file of the ruling Socialist party,
it has provoked some controversy, but only about the means, not about the
ends: some deputies argued the case for increased taxation, others urged the
raising of a special Gulf war loan; but almost none has queried the
necessity of holding the line on the budget deficit of FFr80bn.
The explanation for this broad-based consensus is that France has been
pursuing a consistent economic strategy, without significant variation, for
the past eight years, under both left-wing and right-wing governments; and
by common consent it appears to be paying off. It was launched by the
Socialists in 1983, when they abandoned their ill-starred 1981-82 rush for
socialism; it was continued by the conservative Gaullists, when they won the
1986 general elections; and it has remained in force under the Socialists,
after President Mitterrand's second victory in 1988.
The overall strategy originated with the decision to put a stop to the
series of three devaluations of the franc within the European Monetary
System (EMS), in 1981, 1982 and 1983, amounting to a 26 per cent drop
against the D-Mark, which accompanied the inflationary expansion of the
socialist experiment. Arising logically out of the anti-devaluation stance
came a radical decision to pursue an anti-inflation policy, with the
explicit long-term aim of narrowing and, if possible, closing the
inflationary gap between France and Germany.
The critical first move in curbing inflation, after a temporary freeze on
prices and wages in 1982, was the decision by Jacques Delors, then the
finance minister, to abolish wage indexation in the public sector - or
rather, to replace indexation based on past inflation with a wage system
geared to expected inflation. Since the government intended to reduce
inflation, this switch meant it could replace an accelerating wage-price
spiral with a gradual wage squeeze.
Besides helping to reduce inflation, the wage squeeze also implied a shift
of resources back into the corporate sector. It was accompanied by specific
tax incentives for company investment and, starting in 1986, a progressive
reduction in corporate taxation.
Thirdly, the anti-inflation strategy entailed a tight monetary policy, with
a steep decline in the growth of domestic credit. In December 1982, the M2
money supply target for 1983 was set at 10 per cent; a year later, the 1984
target was set at 5.5-6.5 per cent.
Fourthly and finally, it entailed the recovery of control of government
spending, followed by a reduction in the budget deficit. Achieving the first
part of this last objective took two years, since the budget deficit went on
rising until 1985, when it peaked at FFr153bn; but since then it has been
brought down steadily every year, and is expected this year to be no more
than FFr80bn.
At this level, it is by now rather modest, less than 1.2 per cent of gross
domestic product. The problem is that the fiscal extravagance of earlier
years still has to be paid for, in terms of the servicing of earlier public
borrowings. Debt service as a share of total government spending has been
rising steadily since 1980, and last year it cost just over FFr124bn; this
was 9.7 per cent of the total budget, and made it the third-largest
component of the budget after education and defence.
This anti-inflation policy has been accompanied over the eight-year period
by an uninterrupted process of structural adjustment through liberalisation
and deregulation; and this process, too, was started by the Socialists,
continued by the Gaullists, and resumed again by the Socialists: the
dismantling of price controls, the removal of credit controls, the abolition
of foreign exchange controls, the deregulation of financial markets, and the
spasmodic withdrawal of government from industrial intervention.
In fact, across the whole field of economic policy, there have been only two
serious ideological quarrels between left and right during the past eight
years: the wealth tax created by the Socialists, abolished by the Gaullists,
and reinstated by the Socialists; and the battle over
nationalisation/privatisation, which is now being put to rest by the
government's decision to admit the principle that private shareholders can
subscribe up to 49 per cent of the capital of state-owned companies.
But if the French economy is now in reasonably good shape, there is
widespread agreement that the process of recovery was essentially due to the
four-part anti-inflation strategy. 'It is these four axes which have allowed
the EMS to work,' says a senior Bank of France official. 'If you can reduce
your costs, having a hard currency policy is an advantage, because it
protects you against imported inflation. And the abolition of wage
indexation was the most important factor, because wages account for
two-thirds of total costs.
'The only problem,' he added, 'is that this process takes time; it took from
1983 to 1987 for the policy to work through.'
For the French, the true test of their economic performance is the bilateral
comparison with Germany. This is partly an indication of the political
importance of the Franco-German relationship, partly a measure of the
economic weight of Germany, and partly a recognition that German economic
policy is (or has been) the litmus test for all the other members of the EC.
But it is also a reflection of the weight of the bilateral economic
relationship between France and Germany, each of which is the leading
trading partner of the other. Nearly 19 per cent of French imports come from
Germany, compared with only 11.6 per cent from Italy; while 17 per cent of
French exports go to Germany, compared with 11 per cent to Italy.
So it is not surprising that the French should set great store by the
bilateral economic indicators, especially the inflation gap and the trade
balance. Ever since they changed economic course in 1983, the French have
steadily narrowed the interest-rate and inflation differentials with
Germany, to the point where they have now nearly disappeared. The bilateral
French trade deficit with Germany was still rather large last year, at
FFr42bn; but it was significantly smaller than in 1989, and the
month-by-month trend shows a steady improvement.
As a result, Mr Vivien Levy-Garboua, who heads the economic strategy group
for the state Planning Ministry, looks forward almost with fatalism to the
prospect of French participation in an economic and monetary union in
Europe. 'The European Monetary System already determines our interest rates,
and we have no freedom for manoeuvre on budgetary policy. So Emu will not
really change anything. Of course, it is a long, painful apprenticeship; but
in any case, no one is proposing an alternative option.'

FT  22 APR 91 / Saddam's killing field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMIR AL-KHALIL

<TEXT>
In justifying the US reluctance to become involved in the internal affairs
of Iraq, American commentators have tended to draw parallels with Lebanon.
But a more appropriate analogy for understanding Iraq's internal situation
in the wake of the Gulf war would be Cambodia.
The whole of Iraq, excluding the areas zoned off by the allied forces, has
been turned into a giant killing field by the ruling Ba'ath party. The
primary purpose of this carnage is to extinguish hope in any alternative to
the present system. To fulfil this intention the Ba'ath has to eliminate
many more people than ever rose up in arms against it. Given the scale of
the destruction of the war, and the onerous terms of the ceasefire
resolution, the only way that the regime can now survive is through genocide
on a scale similar to that practised by the Khmer Rouge. The Iraqis who
remain will then agree to live in near 'apocalyptic conditions' just as the
Cambodians did.
True, there was an uprising and it was crushed by what remains of the
state's machinery of repression. But an uprising is not a civil war,
although it may eventually turn into one. Iraqis rose principally because
they placed responsibility for the catastrophe that had befallen their
country upon their own government. They rose as Iraqis, not as Kurds or
Shias. Nor were they suppressed just by a minority Sunni regime, but by
troops from all sects who over the years had become bound up with the Ba'ath
through complicity in acts of violence. Some sections of largely Sunni
Baghdad did not revolt, for instance, while the Sunni town of Zubayr in the
south did. In its origins, therefore, the uprising in Iraq was not about
sectarian or ethnic hatreds.
But the regime, as the orders it gave its forces in the north to conduct
mass shootings of demonstrators show, is now trying to create a new internal
constituency held together by the notion that what is at stake is a war to
the finish between Arabs and Kurds.
Similarly in the south the uprising was suppressed by indiscriminate killing
(which is still going on) and the deliberate inculcation of Sunni-Shia
sectarianism. The Republican Guard began by targeting civilian areas.
Residential neighbourhoods were shelled from city outskirts using tanks and
artillery. Tanks rolled into Shia neighbourhoods with the phrase 'no more
Shias after today' painted on their armour. People were hunted down from
house to house and killed. Whole families were found in Kerbala knifed to
death. Women and children were hung from the turrets of tanks as human
shields. Bodies were stripped, mutilated and piled on pavements. Each member
of the Republican Guard was awarded 200 dinars for the killing of a Shia and
instructed to shoot males over the age of 15 on sight.
It is measures like these, and 22 years of knowing what the Iraqi Ba'ath are
capable of, that have led people to flee their cities and towns in an exodus
of almost Biblical proportions.
As it grapples reluctantly with what is happening in Iraq, the outside world
should realise this simple fact: there is no way of avoiding both
interference in the internal affairs of Iraq and mass murder.
The UN Security Council has called the refugee problem in Iraqi Kurdistan a
'threat to international peace and security' - indirectly recognising that
the regime in Baghdad represents a grave threat to the very existence of the
people of Iraq.
Similarly the ceasefire agreement which preceded it is itself all about the
world's long-term and indefinite involvement in internal Iraqi affairs -
through, for example, the establishment of elaborate procedures for the
elimination of nuclear, chemical and biological weaponry.
The problem with the ceasefire agreement is not that it interferes but that
it does not interfere enough. By stressing non-intervention in the internal
affairs of Iraq, the document penalises an entire population for the
murderous crimes of its regime. In this sense it is modelled after the
Versailles Treaty at the end of the First World War which so overburdened
Germany as to give rise to the politics of extremism which ultimately
culminated in the Second World War.
The right and proper approach to the termination of such an enormous event
as the Gulf war is the one pioneered by the US at the end of the Second
World War. Then, the victors reached out to help those they had defeated.
But that kind of political imagination is sorely lacking in the world today.
In its absence the march of events by itself is making the argument for
non-intervention in Iraq's internal affairs slip even in the minds of some
of its hardest advocates. The idea of protected enclaves is an illustration
of this.
It needs to be immediately and more boldly implemented by the UN both in the
north and the south of Iraq to ease the terrible suffering of the refugees.
The Iraqi army and all repressive agencies of the government must vacate
these zones fully and adequate UN forces must be provided to protect the
areas.
These UN protected zones are of course only necessary pending the
establishment of civilised government in Iraq. But to establish such a
government will almost certainly require direct action by allied or UN
forces.

FT  22 APR 91 / Leading Article: The case for road pricing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IMAGINE a supermarket which introduced a Pounds 10 entry fee and halved the
prices of its goods. Demand from its customers would soar, its shelves would
be stripped bare, and it would quickly go out of business. As the last
shoppers staggered home under the burden of their purchases, they might
remark that the proprietor had a poor understanding of the way markets work.
It could never be. And yet, it is argued, something similar happens on the
roads. People pay a high price up front to buy, tax and insure motor cars,
then find that the marginal cost of using them amounts to little more than
the cost of the fuel consumed. The result is that they drive too much.
This mattered less when fewer people were able to afford the motoring
market's entry fee. But as prosperity has risen, and with it the number of
vehicles owned, many countries are finding that the pace of traffic growth
is outstripping their ability to increase their road network.
The problem is particularly acute in densely-populated Britain. Congestion
is already serious in most urban areas and on many trunk routes. And
according to Department of Transport forecasts, the number of vehicle miles
being driven will be two-and-a-half times greater in 35 years.
Although a portion of the growth can be accommodated by roadbuilding,
environmental considerations now rule this out in many built-up areas, and
it is becoming an increasingly difficult option elsewhere. So something is
going to have to restrain demand.
Discriminating use
One way of achieving this would be to encourage more discriminating use of
the available road space by eliminating distortions from the market. At
present, motorists do not pay the full social costs of their driving because
they make no direct contribution towards the cost of road deaths and
injuries, towards the environmental costs of noise, visual intrusion and
atmospheric pollution, or towards the cost of congestion itself.
The solution could be a system of charging drivers on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Electronic devices in vehicles would respond with roadside devices to clock
up charges against drivers according to type of vehicle, time of day and
amount of road space consumed. Vehicle owners would receive a quarterly bill
as they do for gas, electricity and telephone charges.
Political difficulties
The idea is not far-fetched. An electronic system was developed and tested
for a pilot project in Hong Kong. It achieved reductions in peak-time
traffic of up to 24 per cent. But the experiment was dropped on civil rights
arguments because the technology allowed people's movements to be tracked.
The logic for road pricing seems inescapable. Certainly it is preferable to
rationing vehicle ownership or allowing congestion to regulate the imbalance
between supply and demand. Yet progress towards it must recognise the
political difficulties of introducing a charge for something which, like
air, consumers have grown accustomed to receiving free.
Acceptance will be more likely if road users are convinced that other
options have been exhausted. This is not yet the case. The government's
heavily-expanded roadbuilding programme will relieve some trunk road
congestion. In urban areas, where congestion is most pressing, much could be
achieved through measures such as tougher enforcement of parking
restrictions, better control over road works, and taxation of
company-provided car parking spaces.
Nevertheless, the breathing space is limited. One city - Cambridge - has
already decided that the only way to solve its congestion problems is to go
it alone with a road pricing scheme of its own. Others may soon follow.
The government has so far stood back from the road pricing issue. It should
no longer do so. An embarrassing failure of road pricing in Cambridge or
elsewhere would exacerbate the difficulty of introducing the scheme more
widely. The government should lend its support to the Cambridge experiment
and do what it can to ensure it succeeds.

No seminar on the future of the motor industry would be complete without the
obligatory address on the challenges of globalisation. Jack Smith, General
Motors' international boss, summed up the problems in an apocryphal tale at
the Stockholm motor show.
Students at an international school were studying the automobile business.
The Americans wrote a paper on the world's biggest and best cars. The
English concentrated on the motor and the glory of the British Empire. The
French topic was love and the automobile, and the Italians never quite
agreed on what their subject should be.
The Germans devoted 12 volumes to the theory of the automobile, and the
Swedes did a thesis on how to make cars for joy and fulfilment. Finally, the
Japanese students came up with a strategic plan for 100 per cent market
share.

With UK undertakers mourning their own deep recession, I hear that
40-year-old Howard Hodgson, who in his heyday was Britain's highest-paid
funeral director, is planning a resurrection.
Only three months after retiring from the graveyard business with a Pounds
6m fortune and big plans to write historical biographies, Hodgson seems keen
to return to the stock market. Only this time he intends to concentrate on
the pre-dead market.
Hodgson, who began life as an insurance salesman before rescuing the
family's under-taking business, plans to target the over-55s with financial
services to be sold by a small army of retired bank managers and
accountants. 'For the first time ever the third age, over 55, has got money
and does want services,' says Hodgson in a pause from filming 'How Euro are
You?' a BBC-TV series warning businesses to prepare for 1992.
Meanwhile, he insists his writing career is not stillborn. Currently working
on 'How to become Dead Rich: a funeral director tells all' - Hunter Davies
suggested the title - Hodgson has not given up hope of writing the
definitive biography of Paul McCartney.

FT  22 APR 91 / Observer: Zwack's mishaps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trouble hounds some people. After first being sacked as Hungary's ambassador
to the US, then having his Budapest flat gutted by fire, businessman Peter
Zwack now has to worry about his livelihood.
The unfortunate Hungarian-turned-American-turned-Hungarian ex-diplomat has a
serious problem. The family alcohol business is deadlocked over who controls
Unicum, Hungary's favourite tipple.
An enterprising ancestor, physician to the Imperial Court of the
Austro-Hungarian empire, invented the dark-green herbal liqueur in his spare
hours. It made the Zwacks rich enough to afford two castles, and for Zwack's
father to wear only silk shirts and send them to Switzerland for cleaning.
He is also said to have insisted on having three seats to himself at the
opera to ensure he had adequate elbow room.
All this disappeared after the Communists came to power. The family fled,
taking the secret Unicum recipe with them, and after various
adventures - such as selling vacuum cleaners in the Bronx - began making the
brew in Italy. More recently, Peter Zwack was lured back to Hungary by the
promise that he could re-take control of the old family business.
Unfortunately for him, the state-owned Budapest Liqueur owns half, and still
produces a rival version of Unicum which it refuses to give up.
Worse, Zwack's public bust-up with the Hungarian authorities is likely to
encourage his enemies to sell out to someone else. Guinness is one outfit
said to be lurking near the counter.

No doubt it is just a fluke, but have you noticed that there is some sort of
correlation between how well a High Street bank is doing, and the size of
stake the chief executive has in the business?
Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, owns Pounds 800,000 of its
shares, followed by Abbey National's Peter Birch with a Pounds 300,000
holding in his company, and Barclays' Sir John Quinton with Pounds 145,000
in his.
Tom Frost, NatWest's chief executive, has a Pounds 75,000 stake, and Sir Kit
McMahon of Midland and Don McCrickard of the TSB each have around Pounds
20,000 in their charges.

FT  22 APR 91 / Observer: Mr Major's memory aid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Honest John Major continues to be haunted by his past. No sooner has the
little matter of his O-levels been sorted out than the hair-shirted folk at
the World Development Movement have dug up another embarrassing piece of
paper.
They have found to their delight that Britain's prime minister replied to
one of their questionnaires in 1983 saying he 'hoped' Britain would achieve
the UN's aid-spending target of 0.7 per cent of economic output within five
years. It would have meant more than doubling the UK's current Pounds 1.7bn
budget.
The WDM hand-out brigade are hoping that Major is made of more compassionate
stuff than his predecessor. The movement's director, John Mitchell, soon to
become a World Bank fat cat, says Major is clearly aware of the needs of the
Kurds, the 27m Africans threatened by famine, and the suffering and untimely
deaths of millions of others elsewhere.
The embarrassing revelation has been timed to coincide with a less than
complimentary OECD biennial review of British aid policy. Over the last
decade the UK has slipped from being the most generous aid donor among the
Group of Seven leading industrial nations, to the second meanest.
'We will be watching Major closely, hoping he keeps his word,' says Ann
Clwyd, Labour's aid spokesperson. Of course, if the Tories lose the next
election, it will be up to Labour to show that its commitment to the UN
target is more reliable.

FT  22 APR 91 / Leading Article: Steel - crisis, what crisis?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS TIME for the European steel industry to stand up and be counted.
Before the muttering starts in earnest that a recession in European steel
demand should be met with EC support measures, the industry must relinquish
its lingering claim to special status, accept that normal competition rules
apply and disavow the use of subsidies and cartels to prevent market
discipline driving out the weakest and the least efficient producers.
The European Commission's recently announced investigation into an alleged
cartel in steel for the construction industry should mark a turning point
for the industry away from cartels and towards competition.
The durability of an opposite view to this reflects steel's history as a
cornerstone for the construction of an integrated European economy. The 1952
Treaty of Paris, covering coal and steel, was the industrial base for the
European Community. Its aim was to make Europe more stable by binding Krupp
and Thyssen, two of the great industrial engines of Germany's war machine,
into a European system for controlling the industry.
These are the forces which made steel's difficulties in the last recession a
'manifest crisis', in EC jargon, complete with import restrictions,
production quotas, price controls and official sanction of huge subsidies.
Political intervention
The pressures for a new bout of political intervention should not be
disguised by the fact that today producers talk about long-term market
stabilising positions rather than quotas; about 'orderly marketing
agreements', rather than cartels. The fact that two of Europe's largest
producers, Ilva in Italy and Usinor Sacilor of France, are still state-owned
guarantees a political ingredient to the debate. It would only take one
government to provide heavy subsidy to one producer, for private-sector
companies to seek production quotas to prevent predatory pricing. Before
long, we would have spiralled back to a semi-official cartel.
There is no justification for such recidivism. The scale of the current
downturn does not compare with the crisis which engulfed the industry
between 1974 and 1988. Then, arguably, it threatened a political crisis
which could have buried the common market beneath a slag heap of economic
nationalism. This time, the industry faces a normal cyclical downturn, not a
crisis, and it is essential that the community shows itself steadfast
against measures which in the end mean higher than necessary steel prices
and a weaker economy.
Old temptations
The last manifest crisis was only palliated at great cost, as new entrants
were discouraged and technical change retarded. Politically managed capacity
cuts were also too shallow and shared in an inefficient way across the
industry, between low and high cost producers. The EC still has overcapacity
of about 25m tonnes a year; fully open to international competition, the
figure could be 50m tonnes.
It would be possible to feel relaxed about the dangers of politicians
succumbing to old temptations, if Sir Leon Brittan, the competition
commissioner, had succeeded in his campaign to scrap or at least
substantially amend the Treaty of Paris, under which the manifest crisis
measures were imposed. That would have removed an important practical and
psychological prop for the industry.
However, there are many effective steps the EC can take short of abolishing
the treaty. First, Sir Leon should be encouraged in his determination to
subject the industry to stringent competition rules. If the members of the
alleged construction steel cartel are found guilty they should be fined well
in excess of the token sums imposed last year on members of the stainless
steel cartel.
More broadly than this, the EC should use the forthcoming multilateral talks
on steel trade in Geneva to commit itself to a liberal regime. This is
possible within the terms of the Paris Treaty. But it will need a public
commitment by the EC to foreswear use of the infamous Article 58 crisis
powers. That would be the right signal at the right time.

FT  22 APR 91 / Arts: Eden Cinema - Offstage Downstairs, NW1
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE ARMITSTEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marguerite Duras's work has a strange bleached quality, which is taken up in
stagings of her plays. It is as if a drying and denaturing wind has played
over her memories, picking them clean of dramatic flesh, leaving only the
bones to be delicately reassembled.
Susan Todd and Iona McLeish, the director and designer responsible for Foco
Novo's billowing production of Duras's Savannah Bay a couple of years back,
team up again for Eden Cinema. Once more the dominant colour is white: white
sand, pale planks which reach half way up the stairs of this basement
theatre. Even the audience seats are shrouded with white rags.
The memories are of growing up in Indo-China. The narrators, Suzanne and
Joseph, look back on a childhood in which nothing positive seems to have
happened except for one brief moment of optimism after their widowed mother
erected a sea wall to make her lands farmable, and before the Pacific tides
swept it out to sea. This former pianist in the Eden cinema had been conned
by colonial authorities into spending her life savings on a tract of salt
marsh on which nothing would ever grow.
The play, which is certainly not to everyone's taste, functions through a
teasing denial of information. Suzanne knows nothing about her mother's
youth, while memories of her middle age are obstructed by the developing
identity of a lonely adolescent. The older Suzanne (Julia Foster) looks on
as her younger self (Emma Rice) extorts a diamond from a luckless suitor,
then sets off for the city en famille to sell it for money to rebuild the
sea wall.
Almost dispassionately the older Suzanne tells us that her mother was
prepared to sell her as well to make up the money, but we have no way of
knowing whether this is reality or fantasy. Like marriage and escape, and
many other possibilities in her life, it simply did not happen.
Similarly, Suzanne's reports that her mother was mad are undercut by Doreen
Mantle's exquisite portrayal of a sad, still megolith, brooding over the
misfortunes of her own family and the starving peasants. Duras writes
beautifully and unusually for the actress of a certain age, allowing
characterisation to seep out of the cracks between what we see and what we
are told.
Susan Todd picks this up in a moody, elegiac production richly served by a
splendid cast. Emma Rice and Sean Patterson's sullen teenagers, oozing
dangerous passions, are poignantly offset by the sweating pallor of Sam Cox
as Suzanne's suitor and the mellow wistfulness of Julia Foster's
half-comprehending narrator.

FT  22 APR 91 / Arts: Guys and Dolls - Theatre Royal, Plymouth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglo-German relations have taken a theatrical turn with a joint production
of Guys and Dolls by the Theatre Royal, Plymouth and the Deutsches
Schauspielhaus, Hamburg, backed by the Arts Council of Great Britain. Why
the two companies should have chosen an American musical for what is billed
as the theatre's first venture into the single European market is their
business; there can be little no doubt, however, about the universal appeal
of the piece, if it is well done. In Plymouth, it is spectacular.
A great deal of talent has been assembled. The director is Michael Bogdanov,
who has his connections with the German theatre as well as the English
Shakespeare Company. Adelaide, the girl who has been engaged for 14 years
and still cannot quite get Nathan Detroit to the altar, is played by Barbara
Windsor, who will be forever remembered for her performances in the early
Joan Littlewood productions at Stratford East. The Schauspielhaus provides
the sets and properties, and very striking some of them are. The English
provide the players.
A first impression is simply of the sheer ambition of the production. Here
is a large stage well filled with West 46th Street. The skyscrapers tower;
the neon-lighting does whatever it is supposed to do. On the ground, and
under, the Salvation Army competes for space with the crap game and the law.
None of that seems in the slightest way incongruous.
Then there is the attention to detail. Look at the men's jackets, the
gloriously gaudy colours of their suits, sometimes waistcoats, hats and
ties. The gamblers twitch physically while waiting for a game that may not
take place. The production is superb when it comes to highlighting a
particular incident: see the look on Sky Masterman's face when luck really
does turn out to be a lady, or Lieutenant Brannigan's expression on entering
the mission hall only to find the gamblers turned holy.
Again, there is the strength of the ensemble playing. Ms Windsor still has a
lot going for her. She has the old unmistakeable squeaky voice and way of
moving. At Plymouth on Saturday her legs became entangled with a microphone
cord; she got out of it admirably. She is a star in her own right, but when
she sings 'Take Back Your Mink', it is the ensemble as a whole that you will
look at just as closely.
Much the same goes for the even bigger number 'Sit Down, You're Rockin' The
Boat'. It comes when the gamblers are assembled with the brothers and
sisters in the mission hall. There are no stars because everybody on stage
performs with such precision and co-ordination.
It has always been a moot point whether the top couple in Guys and Dolls is
Adelaide and Nathan (played by Gareth Hunt), or Sky the gambler and Sarah
Brown of the Salvation Army. Here let us call it even, while adding that
Paul Greenwood as Sky and Jacinta Mulcahy as Sarah turn it into a race worth
watching. Top of the lot is Steve O'Hara's Nicely-Nicely Johnson. How could
anyone resist a name like that? He joins the Salvation Army in the end and
plays the drum.
The production is at Plymouth until May 4, then tours the English regions.

FT  22 APR 91 / Arts: Our heritage is in a mess - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Everyone has a moment of temporary madness from time to time but it is
worrying when civil servants seem to be afflicted by a state of mind that is
permanently impervious to reasonableness and logic. This, sadly, is the case
when it comes to matters concerning what we have come to call 'the
heritage.'
When Mr Michael Heseltine was last secretary of state for the environment
(in those halcyon pre-poll tax days), he set about the reorganisation of
heritage affairs in order to release another area of activity from
government control. His plans, which included the creation of English
Heritage - an arm's-length semi-autonomous organisation - simply have not
worked.
The act of parliament that established English Heritage intended it to be
the body that advised the Secretary of State on matters to do with listed
buildings. This certainly has not happened. A parallel heritage division
within the department of the environment persistently counters the advice of
English Heritage: it must be those DOE civil servants who are so anxious to
persuade the minister that English Heritage should move to Nottingham, and
its brother organisation, The Royal Commission on Historic Monuments, should
go to Swindon. It is hard to think of a more effective approach to ensure
chaos, failure to communicate and collapse of morale.
Mr Heseltine, I presume, wanted to lift the hand of government from heritage
activities and bring the castles, abbeys and monuments into the market place
so that they could trade and make money. As a marketing organisation English
Heritage has performed well enough. Lord Montagu as chairman (he retires in
August) understood the need to be more commercial. The tiresome logo is seen
widely and there are now 200,000 members of English Heritage. But the
National Trust, with some two million members, shows that heritage concerns
count very highly with a large slice of the population.
What the minister did not seem to understand was the role of heritage advice
and the statutory functions of English Heritage. This whole area has become
so confused that inefficiency and arrogance seems to be the order of the day
over any matter to do with listed buildings and their protection. Leading
proponents of conservation and owners of important buildings find it
increasingly frustrating to deal with English Heritage.
How much more effective will the organisation become when it is in
Nottingham and Swindon with a lot of new staff? In many ways it will be
almost useless. Take the National Buildings Record, which celebrates its
50th birthday this year with a modest exhibition (at the V&amp;A until May 12)
and a book, Fifty Years of the National Buildings Record introduced by Sir
John Summerson (Trigon Press hardback Pounds 14.95, RCHM paperback, Pounds
9.95). This outfit, together with the National Archaeological Record and the
National Library of Air Photographs, produces the National Monuments Record
and is a unique archive of some seven million items. It is something that
scholars, architects and planners consult frequently.
The National Buildings Record (NBR) was set up in 1941 as something of an
emergency measure to attempt a national record of buildings that were under
threat of destruction. In the commemorative book Sir John Summerson tells of
the poignantly inadequate measures that were taken in the 1940s to
photograph and list important buildings. But at least something was done and
it is the stalwart work of people such as Summerson and Miss Dorothy Stroud,
who toiled single-handedly with her camera and without a car in the outer
suburbs of London, that ensured the beginnings of a national architectural
archive.
All architectural writers and historians tend to spend time in London where
they can consult the riches of the NMR at the same time as visiting national
libraries and archives. Who will go to Swindon except in direst need? In a
faintly ludicrous report prepared by Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte, Marketing
Strategy for the NMR published last year, these highly paid consultants
urged all sorts of ways to achieve more 'customers' for the archives. How is
this to be achieved when the raw material is isolated in Swindon? Some civil
servant has been told to decentralise and save money and no-one seems to
have considered the dire effects upon the national capital, which should be
the home of all such archives.
Mr Heseltine seems to be having a tough time at the moment, but he should
realise that the quality of the national environment depends on a re-think
of all aspects of 'heritage' affairs. He could do worse that stop the daft
plans to decentralise as his first step.
It is a pleasure to record that the American architect Robert Venturi has
won the Pritzker Prize - the architectural world's equivalent of the Nobel
prize. His new wing for London's National Gallery opens in July this year -
fortuitously times to coincide with his new recognition as an international
laureate.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There they were, well-preserved ladies egging each other on to slip the
bouncers and make to the front of the stage where they could hand the star
the roses, the china ornaments - and the panties.
Whoever first threw her knickers at Tom Jones should be made an honorary
member of the Guild of Garment Makers because the ritual of the panties has
become the corner-stone of his act. The well-laundered exhibits, ranging
from skimpy red to enormous white bloomers, are handed over for Tom to mop
his brow. They are then returned, with a kiss. It is as decorous as a
Japanese bow.
And as boring. There are signs that Tom Jones, now enjoying at 50 a popular
renaissance, would like to go legit, to wow with his voice rather than his
lower vertebrae. But he is a kindly man and likes to please his fans. So he
stays a tease.
To shouts that he remove his jacket he coyly replies, 'it will all be off
before the night is out - this is just the foreplay', and to the little girl
offering him a flower: 'How old are you love. Nine? Well I can't do much for
you then.' He shakes his body like a gorilla rattling his cage; thrusts
forward on his crotch; and grinds like a corkscrew, surely to share old
memories rather than to excite.
With his cheerful wrinkly smile and his heavy winks, Tom Jones is totally
the entertainer. Yet he could be much more. The voice is still mostly there,
and just as exciting in the lower register. Sustained by a row of six
glasses of water, and what look like mints, he belts out the ballads, rips
off the rockers, and dusts down the old hits for two hours.
The only thing missing is decent songs. The best are the new ones, written
for him by Van Morrison. But there are too many vaguely Latin numbers which
sound like the Romanian entry in the Song for Europe, while the rock and
roll, which currently enlivens the show, is unconvincing pastiche.
You enjoy Tom Jones' act. You like the man. You thrill to the crowd. But not
for a moment do you relate to the music or the lyrics, or imagine that any
genuine feeling inspires the songs. All the genuineness goes into the
love-in between the star and the fans, their appreciation of a jolly rogue -
and that is why the panties play is more important than the performance.

MOWLEM BUILDING has been awarded a Pounds 46.1m contract by Land Securities
for a seven-storey block at 33 Grosvenor Place, Belgravia, London.
Construction work started last month on the contract following the
completion of a six-month enabling works contract also carried out by
Mowlem. The enabling works involved the demolition of the 1950s building and
maintaining the five-storey facade.
The main contract is for a 300,000 sq ft steel-framed building. Steelwork
erection has started and is connected onto brackets that have been welded to
the facade during the demolition contract.
A central feature of the design of the building is the bank of six scenic
lifts within the main atrium. The external windows are triple glazed and the
building is fully air conditioned. Completion of the project is scheduled
for August 1992.
The entire building has been pre-let to Amerada Hess. This will become the
company's European headquarters when it moves in before the end of 1992.

FT  22 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): BR hopes to avert disruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL is to make fresh attempts to reform the bargaining machinery
covering about 115,000 employees to bring it more closely into line with
reorganisation of the railways into separate businesses.
BR's last efforts in 1989 to implement widespread reforms resulted in a
series of one-day rail strikes: trade unions feared that BR wanted to end
all centralised pay bargaining.
Unions and BR management will meet for talks under the auspices of the
conciliation service Acas. BR hopes that, by taking negotiations at a
measured pace through Acas, it can avoid a repeat of the industrial action
of two years ago. Talks are due to start at Acas in May and could continue
for the rest of this year.
The announcement came as rail unions and BR management prepared to resume
this year's pay negotiations. The unions have rejected a 6.5 per cent pay
offer and warned of possible industrial action if their claim for a
'substantial increase' was not met.
Both sides are due to meet again tomorrow and it is unlikely that BR will
make any significant increase in the offer.
On the reform of the bargaining machinery, the RMT rail union said yesterday
that it acknowledged the need for changes but had objected in 1989 to the
way BR had tried to impose a new structure. However, it warned that as a
'minimum requirement' it would want the continuation of a national forum for
pay discussions.

FT  22 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Union plea on pay comparisons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION discord over pay bargaining may be fuelled this week when union
leaders are asked to agree not to use increases for a proposed national
minimum wage as a benchmark for other pay deals.
The controversial suggestions for a scheme under a future Labour government
comes in a heavily revised document on bargaining due to be discussed by the
Trades Union Congress general council on Wednesday. Although a clause on the
minimum wage has been changed, it says unions will be expected not to quote
the agreed minimum pay rise in negotiations for other workers.
This could cause difficulties for craft unions, which were concerned about a
phrase in the first draft in which unions were asked to disregard the
minimum wage rise in talks about more highly paid workers.
The document will form the basis for wage bargaining policy which union
leaders hope to adopt at September's congress. It provides a much tougher
rejection of incomes policies than in the first draft.
The issues discussed in the document are contentious because of fears by
some unions that a national economic assessment (NEA), which is proposed by
the Labour party in part to help determine a national minimum wage, could be
a prelude to an incomes policy.
Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEU engineers, had not seen the
document yesterday but said his union would not accept an erosion of craft
differentials.
Some of the objections of other unions appeared to be answered, however. One
left-wing union official expressed satisfaction that the document appeared
to give a fuller commitment to the pursuit of full employment than the first
draft.
He also noted that it placed less emphasis on the effects of wage inflation
and more on the effects on the British economy of productivity and training.

FT  22 APR 91 / Court case against Lloyd's opens today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST of a series of legal battles involving members of Lloyd's of
London, the insurance market, will start in earnest today when the High
Court in London considers a case involving Oakeley Vaughan Names.
The case is particularly significant as Lloyd's itself is specified in the
action. It will be the first time in the market's 300-year history that it
has been sued by Names, as members of Lloyd's are known.
Four underwriting syndicates managed in the early 1980s by the Oakeley
Vaughan agency - now liquidated - suffered losses of Pounds 30m to Pounds
35m. More than 250 Names were originally members of the syndicates, and 23
Names are suing the Lloyd's Corporation for failing to supervise the market
properly. Twenty-two Names are party to a subsidiary writ.
The case could bring unwelcome publicity when Lloyd's is seeking to persuade
many of its 26,500 Names to increase the amount they commit to underwriting.
It comes less than three weeks after it emerged that the Serious Fraud Squad
was considering an investigation into a separate business deal at Lloyd's.
Furthermore, civil cases by more than 3,000 Lloyd's Names involving
accusations of negligence against agents and - in some cases - brokers are
set to come to court later this year or in 1992.
In the Oakeley Vaughan case the Names are suing Lloyd's to establish whether
Lloyd's owes a duty of care to them in relation to the supervision of their
syndicates. The Names allege that Lloyd's was negligent in that it should
have taken action to close the Oakeley Vaughan agency before the losses were
incurred. They allege that Lloyd's was in breach of its duties to Names
under contract, statutory and common law.
It is understood that Lloyd's denies that it has a duty of care in the sense
that a Name is entitled to rely upon Lloyd's to exercise satisfactory
supervision of the market. Lloyd's will also claim that under the terms of
the Lloyd's Act of 1982 it is immune to any action alleging breach of duty.
The case is to be heard by Mr Justice Gatehouse and is expected to last up
to nine weeks.
Oakeley Vaughan managing agency, originally part of a group which owned a
Lloyd's broker, managed four syndicates specialising in aviation, marine and
non-marine business. It was led by Mr Charles St George, a former Coldstream
Guardsman and racehorse owner, and developed a glamorous image, attracting
celebrities such as Mr Henry Cooper, the boxer, to be directors of its
broking company.
The Names allege that Lloyd's knew as early as 1981 that the syndicates were
breaking market regulations, among other things by 'overwriting' (writing
more premiums than they are allowed to do under Lloyd's rules). But it was
in November 1982 that Lloyd's decided to withdraw permission from the
managing agents to manage the syndicates.

FT  22 APR 91 / Directors' pay rises criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS' pay increased last year while the real value of managers' pay
fell for the first time since 1984, according to a survey by the British
Institute of Management.
Directors' pay rose by 11.5 per cent for the year ended last January, a rise
in real earnings of 2.3 per cent.
Mr Peter Benton, director-general of the institute, warned: 'This may damage
the relationship on which good leadership is based.'
Directors should ask themselves if they were worth the rises they awarded
themselves, he said. Where earnings were tied to profitability, directors
should accept the same medicine as their managers when profits fell.
Managers' pay rose by 9.5 per cent, but once deductions for tax and national
insurance were taken into account the true value of their wages fell by 0.4
per cent.
Their pay was also hit by a fall in bonuses.
The BIM report showed that more than 11 per cent of directors were paid more
than Pounds 100,000 and nearly one in five received Pounds 10,000 in
bonuses.
Directors in companies with a turnover of more than Pounds 600m received the
biggest rises, with chief executives winning average increases of 22.7 per
cent, taking average remuneration to more than Pounds 210,000.

FT  22 APR 91 / Major's exam search produces six results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR took time off from the affairs of state at the weekend to
check his school records. The result was a definitive announcement from his
office about his O-levels - he has six.
The news was delivered with a touch of resentment that the press had
successfully harried a prime minister into crawling about in his attic
looking for old examination certificates.
There was acknowledgment, however, that suspicion of a hidden 'Schoolgate'
scandal was threatening to eclipse the government's success in getting aid
to the Kurds and abolishing the poll tax.
So once Mr Neil Kinnock had set the record straight over his academic
achievements - he has 8 O-levels, but for much of last week thought it was 6
or 7 - the prime minister had to do likewise.
For those more interested in what Mr Major did 32 years ago than what his
government is planning to do now, Downing Street's response to the 'silly
speculation' of recent days was as follows.
Mr Major left Rutlish Grammar in the spring of 1959 without exam passes. But
he returned in June of that year and secured O-level passes in English
Language, English Literature and History.
He then added to those through correspondence courses, clocking up passes in
Economics, Maths and British Constitution. That was before he passed his
Institute of Bankers' examinations, also taken through a correspondence
course.

FT  22 APR 91 / Ashdown underlines terms for a post-election pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, underlined yesterday that the
price of his party's support for a minority government after the next
general election would be a commitment to proportional representation.
His comments came as senior ministers acknowledged that Mr John Major, the
prime minister, would welcome the endorsement of Dr David Owen - the leader
of the erstwhile SDP - during the election. The ministers dismissed as
'ludicrous', however, weekend reports that such an endorsement could win Dr
Owen a place in Mr Major's cabinet.
News of discussions between the prime minister and Dr Owen prompted a senior
Labour party official to comment that it was further evidence of Mr Major's
indecisiveness. 'When the ditherer is so desperate that he consults the
Doctor it is clear that even the Tories have begun to recognise that their
condition is terminal,' the official said.
Mr Ashdown, interviewed on BBC Radio, said that his party was not seeking a
'hung' parliament as a result of the election. Instead, it was intent on
maximising its own support for a radical strategy that marked it out clearly
from the Conservatives and Labour.
But if neither of those parties won an overall majority, the Liberal
Democrats would respond. The 'bottom line' was that he would not be prepared
even to begin talks with Labour or the Conservatives unless there was
agreement to legislate to end the present first-past-the-post electoral
system.
Mr Ashdown said his message to Mr Major and to Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour
leader, was straightforward: 'Don't even pick up the phone unless you are
prepared to talk about a fair voting system for Britain.'
He denied that the competition between the two main parties to reoccupy the
centre ground of British politics was squeezing the Liberal Democrat vote.
He insisted that radical policies in areas such as education and the
environment marked it out clearly as the party which was prepared to take
tough decisions.
Senior Conservatives confirmed that Dr Owen had discussed the political
outlook with Mr Major at a recent dinner which was attended by other leading
Tory party figures. It was said that the prime minister and the leader of
the defunct SDP 'got on well'. But there was no question of a deal to ensure
that Dr Owen kept his Plymouth parliamentary seat or secured a place in the
government.

FT  22 APR 91 / Local Election Diary (Bath): Tories woo small 'c'
conservatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTMINSTER attracts the weighty ponderings of ideologues and theoreticians,
and community affairs are the territory of no-nonsense doers - the
jam-makers and jumble-sale organisers that tend to hog the letters columns
of local newspapers.
In Regency Bath, such concerned citizens are often small 'c' conservatives -
anti-commercial conservationists and strongly opposed to change. But are the
big 'C' Conservatives, so preoccupied with market forces, their natural
party?
The hung city council has 24 Labour councillors, with the remaining 24
shared equally between the Tories and the Liberal Democrats. At Westminster,
Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, holds Bath with a slim majority
over the Liberal Democrats.
Moreover, in the current campaign, Labour is making the most of its promises
that it will return to the rates, protect education and preserve the
National Health Service - deeply conservative stuff to some ears.
A fair number of supplicants at Mr Patten's weekend surgery were small 'c'
conservatives, not to be relied on by the Tories. There was the computer man
concerned about post-privatisation water quality; a lawyer worried about
tourist traffic destroying the old Georgian city; and a mother-of-three now
living in Pounds 500-a-week bed-and-breakfast accomodation after failing to
keep up the mortgage payments on her council house. With his undoubted
personal charm, Mr Patten calmed fears and promised action wherever
possible.
But he could only count on the lawyer's vote.
AS MINISTER for Overseas Development, Mr Patten was widely identified as
champion of the wetter wing of the Thatcher Government.
His elevation to the chairmanship of the party has 'hardened' his image,
Bath Liberal Democrats claim.
Mr Nick Westbrook, their parliamentary candidate, pushes the point as part
of his effort to join his former Edinburgh University contemporaries - Mr
Archie Kirkwood for the Liberal Democrats, and Mr Martin O'Neill and Mr
Bernie Grant for Labour - in the Commons. 'As Patten has got a higher
profile, he has been cultivating a slightly dismissive, arrogant tone that
has been jarring with people,' Mr Westbrook said, while canvassing.
No evidence of this could be found on the doorsteps, however, with many
voters promising to back the Liberal Democrats in the local elections but
reserving support for Mr Patten when the general election comes.
Putting a brave face on it, Mr Westbrook insisted that elsewhere many Labour
tactical voters would come to him in the national poll.
Perhaps hardly surprisingly, Mr Patten, who dedicates so much of his time to
disparaging the national Labour party, readily confesses to being struck by
the exceptionally high quality of Labour's prospective candidate for Bath.
IF MR PATTEN has a personal following, it is muted among Bath's small
retailers.
A highly vocal local shopkeepers' campaign has grown up to protest at the
impact of high rents and the Uniform Business Rate (UBR). Mr Nick Troup,
proprietor of the Broad Street Bakery and a founder of Businesses Against
Rent and Rates Increases in Bath (BARRB), claims small traders are being run
out of town by a greedy city council and the high prices paid for space by
high-street multiples.
With overheads rising by 265 per cent in five years, he says that even those
who want to close down cannot, as the UBR requires new tenants to take on
properties at their fully revalued rates.
'We are Thatcher's children. We started the bakery with the Enterprise
Allowance Scheme, which encouraged people to get on their bikes,' he
complains. 'Now we are just the government's tax collectors.'
BARRB, which claims a membership ranging 'from JPs to anarchists,' is now
targeting Mr Patten in its high-profile propaganda campaign, quoting him as
saying: 'Businesses have been paying too little for too long.'
With the Tory chairman defending majority of only 1,400 votes, it would be
the ultimate irony if it were business that brought him down.

FT  22 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Engineers will establish strike fund
to bring in Pounds 1m a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGINEERING workers' ability to stage industrial action was enhanced at the
weekend when the AEU union approved the establishment of a strike fund
designed to raise more than Pounds 1m a year.
Strike pay will rise from Pounds 25 a week to Pounds 30, with a possibility
of more for special campaigns, and union leaders said yesterday that this
was expected to rise significantly in future years.
Adult members will be required to contribute 10p a week, taking their weekly
union dues to Pounds 1.35.
Mr Bill Jordan, AEU president, said the fund showed how the union was
learning the lessons of the shorter working week campaign. In this, a levy
by the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions of members was
instrumental in the unions winning a two-hour reduction in the 39-hour week
for more than 500,000 workers.
Mr Jordan said the new AEU fund meant that 'we will leave no doubt that,
when we take employers on, we can put our money where our mouths are'.
Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary, said the fund could be used in a drive
for a 35-hour week or for other campaigns.
Mr Laird said that during the past decade the union had spent Pounds 1m a
year on average in dispute benefits, and expected similar amounts in future
to be drawn from general funds. The strike fund would be separate. Of the
Pounds 1.2m expected to be raised annually from it, Pounds 200,000 would be
taken up by the increase of Pounds 5 to Pounds 30 in strike pay; the other
Pounds 1m would be held for campaigns.
This would be topped up if the union spent less than the Pounds 1m a year it
expected on disputes not covered by the fund.
The fund was approved by the union's rules revision body, meeting ahead of
the annual conference which began yesterday in Eastbourne. The committee
also approved the creation of three elected posts of women's officers to add
to the one already in existence.

FT  22 APR 91 / CBI/FT Distributive Trades Survey: High-street sales rise
above last year's levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH-STREET sales in March rose above 1990 levels for the first time this
year but volumes remain poor, according to the latest CBI/FT distributive
trades survey.
A balance of +11 per cent of retailers reported that year-on-year sales rose
in March - the first such increase since December - with sales of clothing,
durable household goods, textiles, furniture and carpets contributing to the
improvement. Sales are expected to continue growing during April, although
at a slower rate than last month.
Taking the distributive trades as a whole, however, companies reported
another fall in sales volume during March compared with a year earlier. The
proportion reporting a decline - a balance of - 25 per cent - is less than
February's - 32 per cent, but compares with +9 per cent in March 1990. For
the 11th consecutive month distributors report that they placed lower
volumes of orders with suppliers than in the same month of the previous
year. The March balance of - 38 per cent is unchanged from February, and a
sharp decline in new orders with suppliers is expected to continue this
month.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI distributive trades panel,
interpreted the survey in cautious terms. He said that the improved sales
may be due to this year's early Easter and a rush by customers to buy before
VAT rates increased.
In spite of last month's improvements, retailers covered by the survey
continued to regard sales as poor for the time of year.
Wholesalers reported a drop in volumes of sales compared with the same
period last year for the sixth successive month. The balance reporting a
drop in March was - 44 per cent - a little better than February's - 48 per
cent, but a contrast with March 1990, when the figure was +14 per cent.
Continuing weak demand led to wholesalers' stocks building up further during
March. A balance of +31 per cent of wholesalers believed that stocks were
too high in relation to expected sales, against +25 per cent in February and
+19 per cent a year ago.

FT  22 APR 91 / Think-tank criticises telecoms white paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS to liberalise the UK telecommunications market have not gone far
enough, says a paper published today by the Centre for Policy Studies, the
rightwing think-tank.
The pamphlet, written by Professor William Letwin of the London School of
Economics, argues that the government should build on its telecommunications
white paper, published last month, by promoting further liberalisation and
tightening the regulatory framework.
The white paper proposed abolition of the British Telecom/Mercury
Communications duopoly for domestic communications and opening the market to
new competitors.
Prof Letwin says the government should in addition abolish the duopoly in
international services because this would help reduce prices.
He also favours greater openness in the way Oftel, the industry watchdog,
regulates BT's prices. Prof Letwin argues that BT should be forced to
disclose detailed accounting data and to hold public hearings about its
prices. 'Transparency in regulation can help to stimulate competitive entry;
a lack of it tends to exacerbate uncertainties that discourage entry,' the
paper says.
Similarly, Prof Letwin argues that excessive vagueness over criteria that
determine whether competitors are granted licences will discourage new
entrants.
The paper proposes that BT and Mercury networks should be treated like
'public highways', with competitors being free to inter-connect with them by
paying charges that reflect costs.

FT  22 APR 91 / Electrical shops 'ready for upturn'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recession has forced electrical retailing companies to refine their
strategies and restructure their operations, allowing them to benefit from
any uplift in demand, according to a report by Verdict, the retail
consultants.
The report says the electrical retail trade was one of the first to be
affected by the recession in the late 80s and will be one of the first to
emerge from it. But the report sees little increase in demand until at least
the end of the year.
Dixons, the market leader, has successfully refocused its operations,
according to the report, although this process was accelerated by the threat
of takeover from the rival Kingfisher group.
It has reduced its dependence on discounting, which will help restore profit
margins.
Comet, the chain which is owned by Kingfisher, has lost market share but
still remains the dominant out-of-town electrical retailer, the report says.
The position of the two leading companies will be challenged by Clydesdale,
the Glasgow-based retailer, and the privatised electricity companies, which
are stepping up their commercial activities.
Collectively, the electricity companies account for 10.6 per cent of the
total electrical retailing market, behind only Dixons with 13.3 per cent.

THE journey from Cambridge railway station to Cambridgeshire County
Council's headquarters was short: but not so short as to prevent the taxi
driver making his point.
'It's a complete load of old cobblers,' he explained.
'It's bad enough that you should have to sit in a traffic jam at all,
without having to pay for the privilege.'
Yet pay he might, along with every other driver in Cambridge: for the city
is planning to be the first in Europe to charge people on a pay-as-you-go
basis for the use of its roads.
The idea of rationing road space by charging for it - known as road pricing
 -is gaining ground as offering the most realistic solution to traffic
congestion, particularly in urban areas.
Until now, European governments have preferred to live with worsening
traffic jams rather than risk the political repercussions of introducing
such a scheme.
But in Cambridge the county council has been thrust into the vanguard of
transport planning by a mounting traffic crisis.
The city's rapid economic growth has caused traffic on the main radial roads
to increase by 47 per cent over the past 10 years, and it is forecast to
rise by another 40 per cent by the end of the decade.
The existing roads simply cannot cope, and increasing road capacity would
mean demolishing swathes of the city centre. The Conservative-controlled
county council has decided that the only alternative is to manage demand.
The method it has chosen is to discourage people from using scarce road
space at the busiest times by charging drivers who add to congestion.
Vehicles would be fitted with meters which monitored their progress through
the traffic. Any vehicle stopping four times or more within any  1/2 -km
stretch, or taking more than three minutes to cover the same distance, would
start clocking up units which would be charged to the driver.
For example, the traffic planners estimate that a typical 5km journey would
clock up between four and eight units. If the units were priced at 20p, the
journey would cost between 80p and Pounds 1.60.
Drivers would pay their charges with pre-paid smart cards, rather like
phonecards, which would be inserted into the meter and debited as the
journey progressed. A visual display would tell drivers how many debits
remained.
The meter would be linked to the fuel system and would theoretically cut off
the fuel supply when credits ran out. In practice, an 'overdraft' would be
allowed up to, say, 50 units to give people time to obtain a fresh supply of
cards.
Normally dormant, the meters would come into operation when activated by
micro-wave signals emitted from roadside beacons at all 17 entry points to
the city. Similar signals would switch the meters off as vehicles left.
Meters would be fitted compulsorily, but free of charge, to all vehicles
normally kept within 12 miles of the city centre.
Some 92 per cent of all journeys into the centre originate within a 12-mile
radius. Visitors from further afield would buy day passes from machines at
city entry points. These would be priced at slightly above the average cost
of a metered city centre journey.
Day passes would be placed in windscreens and, as with the meters, would
respond to the micro-wave signals from the roadside beacons.
Vehicles failing to respond as they passed an entry point would be
automatically photographed so that the drivers could be traced through their
registration numbers and penalised.
Ultimately, the aim would be to use the proceeds from the system to
construct a light rapid-transit railway which would provide car drivers with
an alternative means of entry to the city.
The system is the brainchild of Mr Brian Oldridge, transport director at
Cambridgeshire County Council. It is being developed by Newcastle University
with a grant from the Science and Engineering Research Council.
At present, the only other road pricing system is in Singapore, where
motorists have to buy a daily or weekly permit if they want to drive into
the city centre during the morning peak. Permits are checked by police at
the city's 29 entry points.
Mr Oldridge says the fault with the Singapore system is that it represents a
tax on entry to the city which does not relate directly to the use of the
road space.
Under the Cambridge system, people will pay only when they add directly to
congestion. The cost, too, will depend on the motorists themselves. If large
numbers of them insist on using busy roads at busy times, their journey
costs will rise as delays worsen. If, conversely, they try to avoid adding
to congestion, the traffic jams will ease and journey costs will come down.
'Our plan follows simple free-market principles,' he says. 'Motorists
themselves will define the tolerance level. If the congestion price is too
high, it will meet resistance from the market and the price will come down.'
Mr Oldridge is hoping to get a trial of the system in operation by 1994 with
a view to introducing a full-scale system in 1996. Before then, the county
council will have to seek appropriate powers through a private bill.
Inevitably, this will cause controversy.
Surprisingly there seems remarkably little opposition locally. Mr Oldridge
says a city-centre pedestrianisation scheme has brought more objections. He
has received only eight letters on the subject of road pricing, with more of
them in favour than against.
If the taxi driver represents the majority, it appears to be a silent one.

FT  22 APR 91 / Top law firms maintain growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's top law firms continued to grow in size over the past 12 months in
spite of the recession in the property market and the sharp downturn in
mergers and acquisitions work.
Clifford Chance, the largest UK law firm, increased its number of assistant
solicitors by 92, a 17 per cent rise on the April 1990 figure.
Three other top 10 City law firms, Linklaters &amp; Paines, Lovell White Durrant
and Simmons &amp; Simmons, all increased their number of assistants by 11 per
cent, according to The Lawyer magazine's annual review of the top 100
solicitors' firms in England and Wales.
The continued growth in the size of law firms is partly a reflection of
commitments made to trainee solicitors several years ago. The effect of the
recession on law firms is seen more clearly in the 10 per cent fall in
demand for graduates by the top firms this September.
Nevertheless, the overall demand for graduates remains strong. The top 100
law firms are looking for just under 2,000 graduate trainees between them.
Non-law graduates are in increasing demand. At City solicitors Slaughter and
May, 50 per cent of last year's trainees were non-law graduates.
Medium-sized law firms also show a growth in numbers. Richards Butler, in
spite of making some property lawyers redundant last autumn, reported a
year-on-year increase of 25 per cent in assistant solicitors. Leading
provincial firms appear to have been more affected by the recession, with
seven of the top 10 regional firms showing a fall in the number of
assistants over the past 12 months.
The highest starting salary being offered by a law firm to its graduate
trainees this September is Pounds 18,500, the same as last year's highest.
The average starting salary offered to trainee solicitors by the top five
City law firms has risen from Pounds 16,180 to Pounds 16,844.

FT  22 APR 91 / SED '91 show aims to revive construction equipment industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'COLD-SELLING' took on a new meaning in a windswept field near Milton Keynes
as the construction equipment industry attempted the unenviable task of
digging its way out of the recession.
About 200 exhibitors at SED (Site Equipment Demonstration) '91, one of the
UK's largest shows for construction equipment, spent three days last week
watching their products make large holes in a small corner of rural
Buckinghamshire while scouring the landscape for the intoxicating sight of a
genuine buyer.
Sales in the UK construction equipment market fell about 35 per cent last
year because of the recession, and SED, organised by Contract Journal, was a
chance for the industry to find out if recent cuts in interest rates had
prompted a recovery.
There are other shows where the backhoe-loaders, wheeled excavators and
countless other types of equipment stand in pristine showroom conditions,
but the attraction of SED for contractors and plant hirers is the chance to
assess the machines in action.
As the excavators, driven by men in shirts and ties, dug ever deeper,
watched by men in wellies, the men in blazers on the stands adjusted their
metaphors to suit the occasion: 'It looks like we've bottomed out', or
'we've turned the corner', or even 'we're still in the slough of despond'.
For JCB, the largest British-owned construction equipment group, January was
'the pits', said Mr Howard McCallum, distribution manager.
However, the company was now picking up 'pockets of business which simply
could not wait any longer' and was receiving a reasonable level of inquiries
at the show, which for many was the first chance to see its new Fastrac
high-mobility vehicle (above).
No one could accuse the industry of turning up its toes in the current
downturn. SED, in its first year on a new site, was the biggest-ever, with
70 new exhibiting companies and 38 new products.

FT  22 APR 91 / Dublin hint of shift on claim to Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GERRY COLLINS, foreign minister of the Irish Republic, has hinted that
his country's constitutional claim on Northern Ireland could be up for
negotiation when talks on the province's future start on April 30.
British and Irish ministers will meet this week for the last conference
meeting under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement before the April 30 talks,
arranged by Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary.
Mr Collins said on BBC Radio in Belfast yesterday that the talks could well
include Unionist leaders' deep-seated concern about Articles two and three
of the republic's constitution, which lay claim to the north. The talks will
cover a successor to the 1985 agreement and devolution.
'There is no restriction on anybody to raise any matter they want,' Mr
Collins said, adding that he expected a 'vibrant and open' dialogue.
His comments come amid hopeful signs of mutual goodwill among all parties
involved in the talks, but optimism is tempered severely by an appreciation
of the sectarian differences in Northern Ireland.
Mr Collins said that if talks succeeded, 'the reason for the terrorists'
existence will no longer be there'. Mr Brooke told businessmen in the US
last week that he thought success was a 'possibility' rather than a
probability.
Northern Ireland's political parties have been busy preparing - mostly in
secret - position papers for the talks which will see Unionist and
nationalist leaders meeting for the first time in 15 years. Each side is
expected soon to nominate a three-man negotiating team plus seven in
support.
Friday's meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference has deliberately been kept
short although the agenda includes recent allegations over leaks to IRA
terrorists by the Irish police, the economy, tourism and transport issues,
as well as the political talks.
Conference meetings under the 1985 pact have been abhorred by Unionists
because of the influence they are seen to give to the republic's government
in the affairs of the province. The round-table discussions will start with
bilateral talks between Mr Brooke and all the parties, followed by plenary
sessions in Belfast on devolution.
Friday's meeting is expected to consider the location of the subsequent
strands of the talks, which include alternatives to the 1985 agreement.
The aim is to cover 'the totality of relations' within Ireland and with the
UK. No points will be agreed until a complete package is in place.
The Northern Ireland Office is offering administrative back-up to the
political parties involved - the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour
party, the Alliance party, the Democratic Unionist party and the Ulster
Unionist party.
Dr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, said at the weekend that it
was the 'last chance' for some of Northern Ireland's senior politicians to
take part in what could be a historic settlement, a thinly veiled reference
to Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, veteran leaders of the Ulster
Unionist and Democratic Unionist parties respectively.

FT  22 APR 91 / London still in grip of recession, says chamber
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC activity in London continues to suffer from the recession,
according to a survey published today by the London Chamber of Commerce.
The survey suggests that companies are still shelving investment plans and
shedding jobs at an accelerating rate, with output in manufacturing and
service sectors continuing to fall.
The gap in performance between the two sectors has narrowed, according to
the chamber. Tough trading conditions have left once-buoyant service
companies as vulnerable as those in manufacturing.
The survey covers the first three months of 1991 and involves 268 businesses
employing 250,000 people. It shows that the proportion of companies working
at full capacity has halved in the past year, with fewer than 20 per cent
saying they were operating at full strength.
Exports by service-sector companies continued to decline in the first
quarter. Nearly half of respondents reported reduced overseas business. The
same proportion said they were cutting employment levels, and the chamber
says it expects redundancies to continue, although at a reduced rate as the
economic downturn levels off.
The squeeze on profits means that businesses are still making sharp cuts in
investment plans. Some 44 per cent of those involved in the survey said
revised plans meant they would not invest in new plant and machinery over
the next year. Only 13 per cent said they intended to raise investment
during the same period.
The chamber says that, although it does not expect any further deterioration
in short-term domestic conditions, business confidence in the longer term
remains subdued.
Further cuts in interest rates are needed, it stresses, to boost demand and
help alleviate cash-flow problems.

FT  22 APR 91 / Mulroney makes big changes in Canadian cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S LONG-SERVING finance and external affairs ministers have both been
assigned new duties in the most extensive cabinet shuffle since Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative government took office
seven years ago.
Mr Michael Wilson, who has held the Finance Ministry post since 1984, is
taking over an expanded international trade and industry portfolio, where he
will be in charge of Canada's negotiations with the US and Mexico on a North
American free trade agreement.
Mr Joe Clark, the external affairs minister, has been named president of the
Privy Council and chairman of a new cabinet committee on constitutional
affairs. Mr Clark, who served briefly as prime minister in 1979, will have
the job of finding a constitutional formula to keep Quebec in Canada without
alienating the other provinces. He has the dual advantage of coming from
Alberta and, unlike most westerners, being bilingual.
The new finance minister is Mr Don Mazankowski, who is deputy prime minister
and has a wealth of political experience, but only limited exposure to
either domestic or international economic issues.
Mr Clark is succeeded at external affairs by Ms Barbara McDougall, who
previously held the immigration portfolio.
Yesterday's cabinet shuffle is an important part of Mr Mulroney's
preparations both for the forthcoming constitutional talks with Quebec, and
for the next general election, which is likely to be held late next year or
in early 1993.
The Conservatives have a popularity rating of less than 20 per cent but are
given a reasonable chance of bouncing back if the constitutional talks go
well, the economy revives, and if they can outflank two regional parties in
Quebec and the west which have recently siphoned off a substantial part of
their support.
Mr Clark and Mr Wilson are both considered to have performed well in their
previous portfolios, but electoral and other domestic political
considerations appear to have dictated their moves.
Mr Wilson, for instance, has become closely identified with the goods and
services tax implemented earlier this year, and with other unpopular
measures to hold down inflation.
Mr Mulroney also needs a new face at the constitutional talks to help defuse
bitterness caused by the collapse last year of the Meech Lake accord, which
aimed to bring Quebec into the 1982 constitution.
Other changes in the cabinet: Mr John Crosbie (trade) goes to fisheries; Mr
Bill McKnight (defence) to agriculture; Mr Marcel Masse (communications) to
defence; Mr Benoit Bouchard (industry) to health. Mr Jean Charest, who
resigned as sport minister in a scandal in 1989, has returned as environment
minister.

FT  22 APR 91 / Al Sabahs keeping their hold on power: Kuwait's new cabinet
still includes no opposition members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT's organised opposition groups yesterday condemned the emirate's new
cabinet as 'frustrating and disappointing', saying it indicated no will by
the ruling al Sabah family to cede any power.
Although there were 11 new faces among the 20 men sworn into cabinet by
Sheikh Jaber al Sabah, the emir, yesterday to replace the government which
resigned four weeks ago, no opposition or resistance members appeared on the
new cabinet roll.
Moreover, although the list contained fewer members of the al Sabah family,
those who did appear continue to hold the most powerful ministries.
Opposition groups, which have been calling for cabinet representation as a
prelude to the establishment of full democracy in the emirate, were quick to
condemn the new team.
'Kuwaitis will be frustrated and disappointed with this cabinet,' Mr Isa
Shaheen, spokesman for the Islamic Constitutional Movement (ICM), said
yesterday. 'Despite the immensity of the disaster in Kuwait, it seems that
nothing has happened as far as the government is concerned.'
Nevertheless, the emir did not turn a completely blind eye to Kuwait's
post-liberation pressures for change in appointing his new cabinet - a
process which appears to have been the subject of strong internal debate.
He responded to widespread criticism of the government's handling of events
leading up to Iraq's invasion by replacing the defence and foreign
ministers, Sheikh Nawaf al Sabah - who moves to the Social Affairs Ministry
 -and Sheikh al Ahmed al Jaber al Sabah, who have taken the brunt of popular
charges of incompetence.
Equally, though, the emir kept an al Sabah hand on each key ministry by
naming Sheikh Salem Sabah al Salem, the former interior minister, as the new
foreign minister and Sheikh Ali Salem al Sabah as the new defence minister.
The other significant change was the removal of Dr Rasheed al Almeeri as oil
minister after what is widely seen as his belated and inefficient action in
dealing with the oil well fires. He was replaced by Mr Hamoud al Rogba,
formerly minister of electricity and water.
Although no opposition members appeared on the cabinet list, this came as
little surprise to the the anti-government groups which have emerged since
liberation, most of whom recognised that their conditions for joining the
government would not be acceded to.
These included the replacement of the entire cabinet and a firm government
commitment to a date for elections to the national assembly, which was
suspended in 1986. The emir has promised only that elections will be held
some time next year.
The organised opposition, including the ICM and Democratic Forum, a
predominantly leftist umbrella group, yesterday promised to sustain their
anti-government campaign by holding demonstrations both inside Kuwait and in
European and Arab capitals housing large numbers of Kuwaiti exiles.
Their options, however, appear limited. 'It's hard to see what levers they
hold, apart from moral pressure and the denial of consensus,' said one
diplomat.
However, most observers agree that the government will succeed in quieting
demands for deeper reform only by demonstrating greater efficiency than
hitherto in effecting Kuwait's reconstruction programme.
Kuwaiti opposition groups yesterday rejected the new cabinet as a challenge
to the people's will and demanded more democratic reforms.
A statement signed by all opposition groups - representing western-style
liberals, pan-Arab nationalists, conservative Sunni moslems, Shia Moslems,
fundamentalists, merchants and former deputies - said the al Sabah family
was 'opening many doors, threatening national unity, blowing the winds of
unease, doubts and evil'.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SOFIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DECISION by the Paris Club of sovereign creditors to reschedule Bulgaria's
Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.04bn) debt is likely to pave the way for a complete
rescheduling of its Dollars 8.5bn debt to the London Club of commercial
creditors, according to Mr Todor Vulchev, head of the Bulgarian National
Bank.
But the Bulgarian government will not yet ask for cancellation of any of its
debt. The debt to the Paris Club is to be rescheduled over 10 years, with a
six-year grace period.
Also, negotiations aimed at trying to arrange new terms for repaying Dollars
8.6bn are under way with Deutsche Bank, leading a consortium of commercial
creditor banks. All payments of interest and principal were suspended by the
Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank in March 1990. Western banks immediately
imposed a moratorium on fresh credits until the Bulgarian government
guaranteed further payments.
A lack of new credits led to sharp falls in industrial production, down by
10 per cent in 1990. Mr Atanas Paparizov, Bulgaria's foreign economic
relations minister, said at the weekend he expected GDP to fall by 30 per
cent by year-end.
However, he remained adamant that Bulgaria 'will not favour the private
banks to the detriment of the official creditors. We will not repay private
banks from government guarantee credits and medium-term credits. We will
have to pay these banks on the basis of a growth in GDP and exports.'

FT  22 APR 91 / Heseltine pledge on property tax bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government will tomorrow seek to regain the initiative in the local
election campaign with a pledge that most households would pay less than
Pounds 400 a year under its planned replacement for the poll tax.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, will promise a 25 per cent
discount for single-person households and a strict upper limit on bills for
the wealthy, when he unveils details of the new property tax in the House of
Commons.
The bill for a couple living in a property worth less than Pounds 50,000 in
a low-spending local authority could be Pounds 200 or less.
Those on the lowest incomes will be exempt from payment entirely, abandoning
the poll tax principle that everyone should contribute to the cost of local
services.
Mr Heseltine's announcement will be followed on Wednesday morning by a
relaunch of the Conservative campaign for the local elections. National
opinion polls show Labour and the Conservatives each claiming about 40 per
cent support. However, the signs so far have been that Labour is heading for
sweeping gains on May 2.
Ministers last night were voicing confidence that what one described as a
'lorry load' of illustrative figures, accompanying Mr Heseltine's statement,
would persuade many wavering voters to return to the Tory fold.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, had intended to put forward the property
scheme - a property tax based on two-person households with a discount for
single people - as an option for consultation. Charges that he was
'dithering' over replacing the poll tax, have persuaded him to make it a
firm proposal to be introduced in 1993.
Labour did not wait for the full details before launching its attack. Mr
David Blunkett, its local government spokesman, said Labour's proposal for
'fair rates' was the only option which would allow abolition of the poll tax
from next April.
Ministers forecast that the new system would provide Mr Major with an escape
route from the poll tax fiasco. 'It is credible, fair and, above all, it is
not the poll tax,' one member of the cabinet said.
The tax will be progressive, because household bills will be linked directly
to the seven bands into which properties will be slotted according to their
capital values. The bands, covering properties worth less than Pounds 50,000
to those costing a Pounds 1m or more will be set nationally by the
government.
The bands will be relatively tightly compressed to ensure that average bills
for the most expensive properties are no more than 2.5 times those for the
cheapest.
That should produce a ceiling of about Pounds 700 for the most expensive
properties, apart from a few exceptional cases.
Ministers said the tight banding was necessary to ensure that voters in the
south of the country were not unfairly penalised by a return to a
property-based system. It will be seized upon by Labour, however, as a
device to protect the rich.
Mr Heseltine will say that a comprehensive 'capping' system to hold down
local authority spending will ensure that bills for the tax are kept much
lower than under Labour's alternative.
The government estimates that, despite the need for valuation officers to
slot nearly 20m homes into the new bands, the system will save Pounds 300m a
year in collection costs compared with the poll tax.

FT  22 APR 91 / DTI probe to help boost post office competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is conducting an audit of the Post Office to help it decide
how to increase competition in postal services.
The Department of Trade and Industry, in the first independent investigation
of its kind, is looking into the cost of all Post Office functions and hopes
to finalise its report by July.
After the audit a DTI committee, chaired by Lord Hesketh, industry minister
responsible for the Post Office, will draw up its favoured option for
introducing competition into the business.
The Hesketh committee may fall short of advocating outright privatisation
but will almost certainly propose opening the Post Office to some form of
competition in its letters business by encouraging competitive tendering for
particular services.
The audit reflects the priority Mr John Major, the prime minister, has given
to privatisation as an ingredient in the Conservatives' general election
manifesto.
Ministers are frustrated by the lack of financial information provided by
Post Office management. They hope the report will show the extent of any
cross-subsidy between the different geographical and business divisions
within the Post Office.
The Post Office, which has a monopoly on letters costing less than Pounds 1,
is divided into three divisions - parcels, counters and letters. Labour
costs account for more than 80 per cent of total costs.
The DTI wants to know why Post Office profits fell last year from Pounds
170.1m to Pounds 116.4m on turnover up from Pounds 3.9bn to Pounds 4.4bn.
Ministers are also concerned that the consumer is not getting value for
money.
While the DTI has not committed itself to any option, a proposal to
introduce competitive tendering, which falls short of straightforward
privatisation, is gaining support within the department.
Under competitive tendering collecting and sorting the mail would be
contracted out to private bidders. The bidders could include the in-house
Post Office organisation, private couriers or management buy- outs organised
by Post Office staff.
Ministers are sceptical of the ability of private couriers, such as TNT, the
Australian-based delivery company, to run a full letters service in
competition with the Post Office.
Government officials believe that sub-postmasters, who run the corporation's
Post Office Counters division selling stamps and stationery, could be
encouraged to bid for the franchise to collect and sort the mail in their
district.
DTI officials believe there could be scope for competitive tendering at a
regional level for collection, sorting and delivery.

FT  22 APR 91 / Kohl shaken by poll defeat: Economic collapse in east
Germany dogs Christian Democrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HELMUT KOHL, the German chancellor, appeared increasingly beleaguered by
the social and economic problems of the unified country last night as his
Christian Democratic party was crushingingly defeated in an important state
election.
In yesterday's Land (state) election in the Rhineland Palatinate, Mr Kohl's
home state, the Christian Democrats (CDU) lost control of the state
parliament to the opposition Social Democrats. This is the first time the
CDU has lost the state since the Second World War.
The result will also cost the ruling Bonn coalition of Christian Democrats
and Free Democrats its majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house of the
German legislature. The Bundesrat has veto powers over all legislation
affecting the states, including tax law, and the loss of the coalition's
majority would hamper the government considerably.
Yesterday's election amounts to a severe rebuff for Mr Kohl, who made no
fewer than 14 appearances in the state during the campaign. Coming only five
months after his triumph in the first pan-German general elections, it
underlines the extent to which the economic collapse of what used to be
communist East Germany is dogging the CDU.
In particular, voters appear to have been influenced by controversy over Mr
Kohl's handling of an increase in taxes needed to pay for the costs of
reconstruction in the east.
The CDU in the Rhineland Palatinate firmly laid the blame for defeat at
Bonn's door. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democratic candidate who seems
all but certain to lead the Land's next government, called the result 'a
clear defeat for Helmut Kohl'.
Mr Volker Ruehe, CDU national secretary general, termed the outcome 'a
bitter defeat'.
Support for the CDU fell abruptly at Land level in February after the Bonn
government - going back on repeated assurances last year that taxpayers
would not be called upon to finance the rapidly mounting costs of
unification - announced a hefty tax surcharge for a year from July.
Last year the 'unity chancellor' reaped the political dividend of the
historic unification of the two halves of Germany. However, Mr Kohl's
position now looks increasingly difficult, as the true complexion of the
eastern economic and social collapse comes to light.
Mr Scharping's campaign had capitalised on the so-called 'tax lies' with the
biting slogan on placards across the Land: 'One doesn't vote for people who
lie like that.'
The CDU's electoral fortunes appear to have been sliding for some time.
Yesterday was the 13th occasion in 15 national and west German regional
elections since January 1987 that the conservatives have slipped at the
polls - the most recent exception being the December general election.
The CDU, with just 38.7 per cent of the vote according to the provisional
final count, kept 40 seats in the state parliament, a loss of eight; the
Social Democrats, with 44.8 per cent, gained seven seats for a total of 47.
The Free Democrats, previously in coalition with the CDU in the state, were
left with an unchanged seven seats and 6.9 per cent of the vote.
The Green party, experiencing something of a revival in its fortunes after
its failure to attain the critical 5 per cent in the December federal
elections, slipped comfortably into the Mainz parliament with 6.5 per cent
of the vote.
This leaves the SPD, mathematically, with a majority whether it seeks the
Greens or the FDP as its partner.

FT  22 APR 91 / Bush may seek UN forces for northern Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US may seek United Nations Security Council approval for a UN
peace-keeping force in northern Iraq to provide security guarantees to the
Kurdish refugees, Vice-president Dan Quayle said yesterday.
This would allow the early withdrawal of US marines and other allied forces
 -whose presence has drawn protests from Baghdad - in spite of their lead
role in erecting the first refugee camps for hundreds of thousands of Kurds
trapped in the mountains.
Mr Quayle stressed in a television interview that the US presence in
northern Iraq was temporary, possibly lasting between 60 and 90 days.
Last week, President George Bush abruptly reversed policy and ordered US
troops to take up positions inside northern Iraq, to take the lead in the
international relief effort and toprovide security to the Kurds.
A US military convoy of 50 vehicles moving into the northern town of Zakho
to help build a refugee settlement was confronted yesterday by 200 armed
Iraqi police whose deployment, the US military said, violated an agreement
for Iraqi security forces to withdraw from the town.
US and allied commanders met Iraqi army officers on the Iraqi side of the
border on Friday and told them to withdraw their forces to a line 30km south
of Zakho to make way for refugee havens and to allow residents to return
home.
Both the marines and the Iraqi police, who seemed to have just emerged from
several coaches parked in the town centre, were taken by surprise by the
encounter. Moments later, two marine armoured vehicles drove up to the scene
and the Iraqi police withdrew.
In Baghdad, a delegation of Kurdish leaders started surprise autonomy talks
with the Iraqi regime believed to focus on ways of encouraging the return to
their homes of some 2m refugees.
The leader of the delegation, veteran guerrilla chieftain Jalal Talabani who
arrived in Baghdad at the weekend, wants the revival of a 1970 agreement on
autonomy for some 4m Iraqi Kurds.
A spokesman for the group,which includes representatives of all the main
opposition groups, said it would insist that any autonomy agreement to end
conflict between Kurds and Baghdad be backed up with guarantees from the
international community, preferably the UN.
Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the UN delegate in charge of the refugee
programme in Iraq and Kuwait, called for 'reconciliation and convergence'
between the US desire for early withdrawal and the need for an effective
police force to protect the Kurds.
The UN effort is centred on providing safe passage for the Kurds to enter
refugee camps where they can be fed, sheltered and treated for disease. The
next vital step was to encourage the Kurds to go home, said Prince
Sadruddin.
He came close to hinting that the only country with the authority to
persuade the Kurds to go home was the US, with its 'thousands of troops and
hundreds of helicopters'. The alternative was to risk creating a permanent
Kurdish refugee camp like the Gaza Strip, home of thousands of Palestinians.
Iran, meanwhile, voiced strong reservations about the involvement of western
governments in the establishment of Kurdish sanctuaries in northern Iraq.

FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Export and Technology 1991 (Company
Profiles): A slate substitute for weather-beaten roofs - Redland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDLAND, the world's largest tile manufacturer, is best known for its market
leading concrete tiles. It has recently been building on its worldwide
strength to increase output of other types of tiles, notably clay tiles
which command better profit margins.
Last year the group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 245m - only Pounds 5.2m
lower than in 1989 in spite of a deep downturn in UK commercial and
residential construction. The group's strengths lie in its geographical
spread of businesses together with a wide range of roofing products which
enable it to tap different areas of demand when markets are in recession.
The development of new products to keep up with changing tastes is essential
if the group is to sustain its position in the roofing market.
The Queen's Award for technical achievement was made to three Redland
subsidiaries which together developed a high strength, lightweight,
composite tile which looks like slate but is cheaper and easier to use. The
companies have replicated a building product which took the earth millions
of years to make, says Redland.
Redland Roof Tiles, the UK tile manufacturing division, Redland Engineering
and Redland Technology share the award for the Cambrian slate tile, a
combination of 65 per cent natural slate, stone, resin and glass fibre
reinforcement. Redland describes the tile as 'having an authentic appearance
of genuine quarried slate, whilst being lightweight, quick and simple to
use, and offering the cost benefits of precisely controlled high speed
production. The product is approximately half the laid price of Welsh
slate.'
The tile was launched on the British market in 1985 and now holds about 10
per cent of the UK slate market. Its technical performance since the launch
persuaded Redland to give it a 60-year guarantee - at least 10 years longer
than that on any other man-made slate, it says.
The tile comes with a three-point fixing system to cope with high winds.
Demand for the product has been particularly high in areas where strong
winds, heavy rainfall and slate roofs are traditional.
The development of the Cambrian tile dates back to the late 1970s when other
slate 'look-alikes', generally made of fibre cement, started to replace more
costly natural slate. Redland Roof Tiles set out to develop an alternative
and during the early 1980s Redland Engineering came up with the product
prototypes as well as the tooling and plant for its manufacture. Redland
Technology then conducted tests for weather resistance at its wind tunnel in
Horsham, West Sussex.
In 1985 a factory for the Cambrian slates was built at Rassau in south
Wales, which has since added further slate lines and a fittings section.

FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Export and Technology 1991 (Company
Profiles): Image change extracted cash from cashmere - Ballantyne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the most famous names in Scottish knitwear. Ballantyne is based in
the little town of Innerleithen, in a fold of the hills by the River Tweed
in the Borders. For years it produced smart sporting attire under the name
Ballantyne Sportswear.
But two years ago its image and products were dramatically changed.
'Ballantyne Sportswear conjured up a picture of jogging suits and sneakers,
despite its use of cashmere,' says managing director Mr George Peden.
'Ballantyne really should be about cashmere.'
The company is now known as Ballantyne Cashmere and has a completely new
corporate image, designed by the Mayfair design consultants Landor
Associates. Mr Peden, who formerly ran Barrie - like Ballantyne, a knitwear
subsidiary of the Edinburgh-based Dawson International - called in leading
fashion designers including Alastair Blair and Oscar de la Renta to create a
completely new line of cashmere clothes.
The new range included sports jackets, dressing gowns and blazers, in
contrast to the classic V-neck pullovers of the past. The new ranges, says
Mr Peden, have been well received and he believes the company's image change
has succeeded.
Ballantyne has always exported a substantial amount of its turnover. 'We
export about 85 per cent of what we make,' he says, while much of what the
company sells in Britain is bought by overseas visitors. Turnover is now
around Pounds 27m a year, compared with Pounds 25m two years ago.
Mr Peden believes his company's Queen's Award is for a consistently high
export performance, rather than a spurt in overseas sales.
Ballantyne's change of strategy was, in part, a response to difficult times
in the cashmere industry. In common with other knitwear companies, cashmere
makers were affected by changing fashions as people opted for woven rather
than knitted garments.
The price of raw cashmere soared by about 50 per cent in two years as China,
where most cashmere comes from, allowed individual farmers to market their
own produce - but the quality of Chinese output became highly variable. The
decision to upgrade the design of Ballantyne's products reflected the belief
that if people were to pay high prices for cashmere, it needed to be very
special.
'Textiles are still going through a difficult time but if we hadn't updated
our lines and our image, it would have been very hard for us', says Mr
Peden.
An important part of his strategy has been further to differentiate the
Ballantyne brand. Part of this has been done by creating dedicated
Ballantyne shops: the first opened in London's Bond Street last April and
new shops will open in Paris, New York and Tokyo.
Ballantyne's biggest export market is Italy, followed by Switzerland, Japan,
France, the US and Germany.
Unlike many other Borders knitwear companies, Ballantyne has had no
short-time working or redundancies in recent years, although the workforce
has declined from 750 in 1989 to 670 today due to natural wastage under a
productivity improvement programme. The bulk of the workforce is in an
old-fashioned building at Innerleithen with the rest at Bonnyrigg near
Edinburgh.
Dawson International recently reached a new agreement with China which
should led to stabilising the price and improving the quality of Chinese
cashmere.
Mr Peden says that knitwear is still going through difficult days. 'A lot of
our sales are to tourists and many of them stopped flying because of the
Gulf war,' he says, though he adds that the situation is beginning to pick
up.

FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Export and Technology 1991 (Company
Profiles): Happy occasion for greetings card maker - Second Nature
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rod Schrager's business maxim is 'focus at the top end of the market'. In
10 years he has turned a chance holiday encounter into a successful
greetings cards company using just that principle.
'A Queen's Award puts the seal on our success in building up a British
presence in an international industry', he says. His company Second Nature,
a publisher of quality cards and Christmas decorations, has a projected
turnover of Pounds 7m this year, and expects to sell more than 1m cards a
month - one quarter of which will be outside the UK.
By contrast, most greetings card manufacturers do not export very much, he
says. The reason is that they focus on the bottom end of the market.
Low-priced cards can easily be produced locally, and some designs -
including those with a particular country's humour - often do not easily
translate to overseas markets.
He points to three segments in the greetings card industry: those bought for
associates; for family and close friends; and 'the one or two beautiful,
more expensive cards for those you are closest to'. Second Nature focuses on
the latter two categories, with a series of elaborate cards at higher
prices.
The company was launched in 1981 after Zimbabwean-born Mr Schrager, who was
then working as an accountant for Peat Marwick in the UK, went on holiday to
the US. He met a Californian designer who asked him to try to sell some of
his greetings cards with floral patterns in Britain. Keeping up the theme,
he also suggested a name: Second Nature.
Schrager was surprised to find British retailers greatly interested, and on
an investment of Pounds 3,000 of his own money, he started to produce the
cards himself, with designs under license from the US.
His big break came four years ago, when he began to sell pop-up cards. The
pop-up was originally invented by the Victorians and then faded out in card
designs, although a number of books using the same principle were beginning
to emerge in the early 1980s.
'I just brought the idea back up to date,' he says. 'We wanted an unusual
design, but one we could produce commercially. It was quite a bold move
then.' Second Nature began selling cards at Pounds 2.50, at a time when the
average card price was about 65p. 'But there was a definite need for a
contemporary card with a higher price.'
Now the company has a total portfolio of some 800 cards. Half a dozen of the
designs have even been patented, and many use sophisticated paper
engineering techniques.
The cards are still entirely made in the UK, using labour-intensive hand
assembly that can take up to three minutes for each card. The company
searched overseas to see if they could be produced more cheaply, but the
difference in costs was negligible.
None of the company's 65 staff are involved directly in production, however.
'I don't believe it's good to vertically integrate,' says Schrager. 'By
contracting out all our assembly work, we can stay on top of innovation and
creativity.'
The focus on higher-end cards also means that the company's business is less
seasonal than for many manufacturers. Nevertheless, Second Nature has
launched high quality Christmas decorations using similar sophisticated
designs.
In two weeks' time, representatives from the company will be anxiously
sitting in New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel. They have 11 nominations for
the 'Louie awards' - named after Louis Prang, inventor of US greetings
cards. But it will be hard to improve on last year, when they were the first
company outside North America to win 'Card of the Year'.

FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Export and Technology 1991 (Company
Profiles): Propellers cut a slice of the market - Dowty Aerospace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNTON MCLAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWTY Aerospace Gloucester has won a Queen's Award for Technology for its
advanced composite bladed propellers for aircraft and hovercraft.
All the composite propellers manufactured by Dowty have been exported. They
have operated in commercial airline service for more than 3m hours, and are
in service with more than 300 commercial airliners, including 300 Saab 340
twin engine aircraft made by Saab Scania of Sweden and 100 Dutch Fokker 50
airliners. The propellers are also used on hovercraft landing craft made by
Bell Textron of the US.
The blades are made from carbon and glass fibres injected with resin,
producing a low weight structure which reduces the total weight of a
propeller system by up to 40 per cent compared with more conventional metal
bladed propellers.
Dowty Aerospace Gloucester has automated the production of the blades. This
involves an automated fibre braiding machine, designed and produced in
collaboration with Babcock, the UK engineering company. The braiding machine
weaves the carbon and glass fibre skins for the propellers in three
dimensions simultaneously on a machine which Dowty says is unique.
The blades are of a simple, lightweight construction, with a retention
system to secure them to the hub at the root. This allows very large
diameter propeller blades to be used for improved efficiency at slower
revolution speeds, which in turn helps to reduce noise levels.
Mr David Davis, the managing director of Dowty Aerospace Propellers, part of
Dowty Aerospace Gloucester, says the two four-bladed Dowty composite
propellers on the Saab 340 34-seat commuter airliner save 200lb in weight,
'equivalent to an extra passenger'.
The propellers use a new aerofoil section which is efficient at take-off as
well as when the aircraft is flying at cruising speed, a range of efficiency
which was difficult to achieve with older aerofoils.
The company is exploring new markets for its composite bladed propellers,
including their use on maritime reconnaissance and military transport
aircraft. The propeller has already been tested on the US Lockheed P3 Orion
aircraft.

FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Export and Technology 1991 (Company
Profiles): Vision of a world covered in chocolate - Cadbury Schweppes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CADBURY SCHWEPPES sees its future in global terms. 'We have retained a tight
focus on our two business streams, beverages and confectionery, which we
have continued to develop by a combination of organic growth, targeted
acquisitions and partnerships,' said Sir Graham Day, the chairman, in the
last annual report.
The company's Queen's Award for Export Achievement is a reflection of this
strategy in the chocolate business, part of the confectionery stream. Within
the group organisation, this particular company is responsible, through
Cadbury International, another subsidiary, for marketing chocolate abroad -
by direct exports from the UK, by direct investment in overseas markets, by
joint ventures with local companies in particular markets and through
franchising.
Broadly, Cadbury Schweppes International has two strands of revenue: from
direct sales and from dividends and royalties. Concerned about its
competitive position, the group does not separate chocolate sales from
general confectionery sales in any single market or group of markets. Direct
exports of chocolate from the UK, however, are worth nearly one-third of
domestic chocolate sales. Markets served by direct exports include some
European countries, the Caribbean and the Far East.
In 1990, total group confectionery sales came to Pounds 1.32bn, of which the
UK share was just over half. But there were sales of Pounds 195.6m in
Europe, Pounds 30.2m in North and South America, Pounds 290.3m in the the
Pacific Rim and Pounds 91.2m in Africa and elsewhere.
Confectionery produced a trading profit of Pounds 163m, with the UK again
accounting for slightly more than half, while Pounds 19.3m came from Europe,
Pounds 8.9m from the Americas, Pounds 42.3m from the Pacific Rim and Pounds
9.2m from Africa and elsewhere.
This stream of the Cadbury Schweppes business therefore produced nearly 49
per cent of group trading profits, which totalled Pounds 333.9m. Group
pre-tax profits for 1990 were Pounds 280m, or 14 per cent higher than in
1989.
The Cadbury business works with a high degree of decentralisation. The
ownership and general management of the brand names works through the two
business streams but the operational control, country by country, is done on
a local basis. The stream managers develop the products, the operational
managers are responsible for sales.
Business techniques differ from country to country, depending on the
commercial conditions. Cadbury works through associated companies (joint
ventures with local groups) in, for example, Nigeria, India, Zimbabwe and
Egypt, but has wholly owned operating subsidiaries in Ireland, France, Spain
and the Netherlands. The group is also seeking penetration of the US and
Canadian markets through partnerships with, respectively, Hershey and
Neilson.
With such a spread of interests, performance varies. Last year Ireland was
good, Spain developed along predicted lines, the Netherlands traded well,
but France was difficult. Returns were higher from Australia and New Zealand
while companies in Malaysia and Indonesia turned in good performances.
However, a drive into Middle Eastern markets was thwarted by the Gulf crisis
and, as the last annual report put it, 'resources were quickly deployed
elsewhere'.
Last year's trading was abnormal to the extent that considerable energy was
devoted to absorbing acquisitions made the previous year. This was not only
a question of management but also of finances, as moves were taken to
translate short term debt into longer term funding to reflect the
international spread of interests.
One aim, as the group said, was to 'match overseas borrowings with overseas
assets and currency flows'. The group's global aspirations found their
financial concomitant in, for example, preference share issues in the US and
Canada, and an Australian dollar Eurobond issue.
For the future, Cadbury Schweppes will continue to seek acquisitions and
expand organically on both the confectionery and beverages sides of the
business. The group is confident that the market for chocolate and
chocolate-related products will continue to expand.

FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Export and Technology 1991 (Company
Profiles): Excavators clear a path - Komatsu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Komatsu, Japan's largest construction equipment group, announced in
December 1985 that it was to begin manufacturing hydraulic excavators and
wheeled loaders in the UK, the move took many in the industry by surprise.
Komatsu had been more reluctant than most Japanese companies to set up
production overseas, preferring to supply foreign markets from its
well-managed factories in Japan.
But the previous two years had seen the Japanese construction equipment make
significant inroads into the European market, and in July 1985 the European
Community introduced anti-dumping duties on Japanese hydraulic excavators of
26.6 per cent.
That was one reason why Komatsu decided to take over a factory at Birtley
near Newcastle-upon-Tyne that had been closed one year earlier by its larger
worldwide rival, Caterpillar of the US, with the loss of 1,000 jobs. But the
chief aim was to respond more quickly to the needs of European customers.
It is in that context that the receipt by Komatsu UK of a Queen's Award for
export achievement should be seen. Komatsu's aim was to make Birtley the
European manufacturing centre for hydraulic excavators, and it remains the
Japanese company's only facility in Europe devoted solely to manufacturing.
Komatsu is now the largest hydraulic excavator producer in the UK, and with
annual sales of nearly Pounds 100m it believes it is on the way to being the
largest in Europe. It exports around 70 per cent of its output of around
2,000 units a year.
The Birtley plant has become an integral part of Komatsu's European
oper-ations. Until a few days ago, it produced a mixture of excavators and
wheeled loaders, but production of the latter has gradually been transferred
to Hanomag in Germany, which has been controlled by Komatsu since late 1989.
This will allow Komatsu to expand its range of excavators produced at
Birtley. The company makes six basic machines in the 12 to 30-tonnes class
and offers 16 variations on each product.
Mr Saichi Etchuya, Komatsu UK's managing director, says the company chose
the north-east as its home for its 'outstanding combination of skilled
labour, available resources and excellent communication links with the rest
of Britain and Europe'. The company claims it is the first Japanese group in
the north-east to receive the export award.
Komatsu's approach to running Birtley has been to adopt 'the best of both
worlds' by integrating Japanese management practices with UK resources.
Local content of its machines is around 70 per cent.
This strategy, along with increasing steps towards autonomous, localised
management, has enabled Komatsu UK to win recognition as a 'UK company'. In
October 1988 it was accepted as a full manufacturing member of the UK
Federation of Manufacturers of Construction Equipment and Cranes, and hence
of the Committee for European Construction Equipment.
Mr Etchuya says the award 'clearly recognises the contribution made by all
of our employees and the efforts of our sales and distribution outlets'.
Employment at the plant has been fairly stable in recent months at 450,
which compares with an earlier target of 370.
The award comes at a testing time for Komatsu and its rivals in the
construction equipment industry. Producers are facing a severe fall in
demand in the UK, but this has been offset by extremely buoyant conditions
in Germany, prompted by reunification.
The decision by Komatsu and other Japanese producers to set up plants in
Europe may have been forced upon them, but the environment in the early
1990s is very different from that of the mid-1980s. Around 85 per cent of
Japanese excavators sold in Europe are produced there too, mainly by Komatsu
at Birtley and a Fiat/Hitachi joint venture in Italy.
And the anti-dumping duties, imposed for a five-year period, expired quietly
last year.

FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Export and Technology 1991 (Company
Profiles): Success comes from behind a smokescreen - JEM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CLIFF RICHARD, the Clash and the Dutch fire brigade do not have much in
common, but they all share a need for one vital ingredient: smoke without
fire. From its Lincolnshire headquarters, JEM Smoke Machine Company has a
solution.
About 60 per cent of JEM's business comes from the entertainment world,
supplying machines which churn out smoke for artists, pop groups, television
companies, theatres and nightclubs.
A recent contract for the Cure rock group demanded that the band be
completely submerged in smoke during its performance. Other clients with
strange and taxing requests have included the Rolling Stones, the London
Hippodrome and Disneyworld. JEM can provide a few seconds to an hour of
smoke, with depths of 10mm to more than 2m.
Another 40 per cent of the company's turnover comes from projects such as
fire emergency training for the London Fire Brigade, the Swedish and British
navies and Boeing aircraft flight simulators.
Emergency evacuation procedures used to create smoke by setting light to a
bundle of hay, but the smoke was toxic, and the simulations could become as
dangerous as real fires, since smoke inhalation normally causes more
injuries and deaths than flame burns.
The Royal Aerospace Establishment in Farnborough uses JEM smoke in its wind
tunnels; Shell tests for leaks in pipelines with the smoke; and a recent
contract for Belgian market gardens uses the smoke to keep fruit warm and
protect it from frost.
Mr Nigel Morris started the company in 1981 after becoming joint director of
a sound and lighting equipment company, but without any equity stake. 'I was
at a dead end,' he says. 'There wasn't any further I could go, so I decided
to set up on my own.'
He began importing and exporting lighting and special effects, particularly
those for smoke generation. By late 1984, he was ready to launch a machine
of his own on to the market. 'The marketplace was open. Margins were getting
smaller and smaller in our business. But no one had ever designed a
custom-made smoke machine,' he says.
Conventional smoke machines use 'dry ice' which has to be stored at
extremely cold temperatures and then added to boiling water. It dissipates
quickly and can cause severe frostbite if not handled properly. 'It's very
old fashioned,' says Mr Morris.
JEM has developed 20 types of fluid, storable at room temperature, which use
highly refined polyglycols mixed with de-ionised water. When the fluid is
passed through a heat exchanger in the machine, it turns into safe,
non-toxic smoke. The machines retail for between Pounds 250 and Pounds
6,000.
The company employs 40 staff, and manufactures about 1,000 machines a month.
It also employs a part-time chemist, who is developing a product ready for
launch in the next few weeks: a pryotechnic machine, which will create
firework effects and coloured smoke. JEM has spent Pounds 180,000 developing
the device and has a number of patents pending.
'We take the most difficult and complicated things we can do, which makes us
insulated from competition and the machines difficult to copy,' says Mr
Morris.
JEM's turnover was Pounds 2m last year, and the company expects that to rise
to Pounds 3.5m this year. It is one of the largest companies in its industry
with only a handful of competitors.
Exports - which account for nearly 80 per cent of turnover - have been built
up through a worldwide distribution network of theatrical agents and
exporting companies. JEM now only tends to handle the larger orders itself.
'We're not geared up to the Pounds 200 per product market,' says Mr Morris.
'But we handle the artists, who are invariably extremely temperamental.'

FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Export and Technology 1991 (Company
Profiles): Far East specialists - Baring Securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARING Securities stands out among Queen's Awards winners in two ways: not
only is it the only stockbroker to win an award, but it does so for the
second time.
'It's helpful for staff morale . . . and intriguing for our foreign client
base', Mr Christopher Heath, founder and managing director of the company,
says thoughtfully. After its last award in 1988, one Japanese business
magazine mistakenly credited it as being newly-appointed stockbrokers to the
Queen. That certainly did not harm business.
Overseas earnings have tripled since 1988. Over the same period the number
of offices around the world has increased from five to 19, and the number of
staff from 370 to more than 1,000.
The significance of exports is such that all but 2 per cent of revenues come
from abroad, principally the Far East. Earnings were estimated to be around
Pounds 70m during the last financial year.
The vast majority of earnings - some 70 per cent - are from Japan. Around 20
per cent derive from south-east Asia, with the remainder coming from Europe
and Latin America.
The company has focused on the Japanese market since it was launched in
1984, and makes its money from both equities and derivatives - warrants,
futures and options. More than half of that business is notable in coming
from Japanese businesses themselves, which are buying Japanese products.
Mr Heath points to three factors which have helped the company do so well in
a difficult foreign business environment: a commitment to research; a strong
distribution team; and an acknowledged expertise, including strong
market-making capabilities. It also helps that 215 of the 250 staff in the
Tokyo and Osaka offices are Japanese.
'We are unique among stockbrokers', Mr Heath adds. 'Japan has always been
our business. We are not simply a UK business that has decided to
diversify.'
'Culturally, we run as a broking operation. Our success since Big Bang is
due to the fact that we started from a blank sheet', he says. Baring has not
had to fight the internal battles that have hampered and destroyed many
financial service businesses since the mid-1980s.
Mr Heath himself was a Far Eastern specialist with stockbrokers Henderson
Crosthwaite when he was asked to establish Baring Securities in the build-up
to the changes in the City wrought by Big Bang in 1986.
'I had personally been following the Japanese market since 1974, and
believed it had a lot to offer', he explains. 'We had a research base and an
office in Tokyo, and built up a business based on Japan.'
Baring Brothers, the merchant bank, approached him to set up an independent
company, to be run on similar lines as Baring Asset Management: financed by
the parent company as a 100 per cent owned subsidiary, but operating
entirely independently.
However, intense concentration on Japan has brought someproblems. 'We were
fortunate up till last year', says Mr Heath. 'Then the Japanese market
collapsed.'
The declining volume of equities being traded cut into earnings.
Nevertheless, business from other regions - and in derivatives, which were
less affected by the stock market crash - meant the company did not cut
employment, but actually increased the number of staff.
'I think things will consolidate and we will be well positioned to benefit
from sustained recovery in the market,' Mr Heath says.
At the same time, he has also increasingly steered the company into new
regions. Barings' earnings from Japan have declined to 70 per cent from 85
per cent three years ago.
Looking to the future, Mr Heath predicts that the company will continue to
diversify into new areas. He is sceptical of new opportunities in eastern
Europe, at least in the short term. But he is looking carefully at Latin
America, and planning further expansion in the emerging markets of Indonesia
and Thailand.

FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Export and Technology 1991 (Company
Profiles): Clean sweep for new dust extractor - British Coal
</HEADLINE>

a lung disease contracted by inhaling dust - because of a new device that
has just won the company its sixth Queen's Award for technology.
Credit for developing the dust extractor goes to a team at the British Coal
Technical Department (BCTD), headed by Dr Vic Ford, whom his colleagues
describe as 'a dust expert'.
Dr David Buchanan, director of research at BCTD, which employs around 500
people, explains how the extractor works. 'The actual coal cutting machine
is like a bacon slicer - it carves off a couple of feet of coal at a time
from the coal face.
'On that machine there is a rotating disc, with metallic picks that knock
the coal off. What we've done is to drill holes round the outer part of the
disc, or drum.
'Then we blow air through to the other side of the drum, using pressurized
water. The dust sticks to the water droplets and is blown through to the
other side of the drum, where the water hits a metal plate and drains to the
bottom.'
A beneficial side effect of the new drum is that the airflow it creates
dilutes the methane that naturally occurs in coal mines and can ignite
accidentally during mining.
British Coal has been tackling dust for some time: it won a Queen's Award
for a dust measurement device in the 1970s, and another for a dust filter in
1984.
Although dust levels in British Coal mines are low by world standards,
explains Dr David Buchanan, director of research at BCTD, it is important to
keep pace with improvements in productivity - more work means more dust.
The award-winning extractor has now been in use for around five years, and
more than 150 have been produced each year for the last three years.
The technology has been licensed to outside manufacturers. A small number of
extractors have already been sold overseas.
Funding to develop the extractor, which costs Pounds 7,500, was provided
partly by British Coal Corporation, and partly by the European Steel and
Coal Community.
British Coal has previously won Queen's Awards for steering technology on
coal cutting machinery, and for developing geological exploration
technology.

Draught taste to take home - Guinness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MAY not rank with the ring-pull; it may even sound like a contradiction.
But to one brewer, it represents a revolution in packaging: draught beer
from a can.
Just 30 years ago, Guinness drinkers were faced with change. The dark brew
they had only been able to buy in bottles was suddenly available in their
local pub on tap.
It was the dawn of a new era. Pressurised pumps were being introduced,
allowing barrels of beer to be rapidly disgorged into glasses. Gas mixed
with the beer as it churned out of the tap through a series of tiny nozzles,
causing tiny bubbles to rise to the surface and form a creamy head.
Experienced bar staff could carve shamrocks out of the thick foam that
gathered at the top of the glass.
But then things changed once more. Drinkers began to abandon the pub for
parties and solitary sips in their own homes. Demand for 'take-home' beer
grew sharply, to the extent that the market is now worth Pounds 1.5bn a
year.
How could Guinness keep their 7m drinkers around the world content and
prevent them switching to one of the rival 300 brands of canned beer? How
could they sustain the volume of one million Guinness pints pulled each day?
The company spent Pounds 5m and five years working on a solution. It applied
for a patent and launched the result in mid-1988: a beer called Draught
Guinness, packaged in the 'in-can system', a can with a special
bubble-generating device sealed inside.
A plastic moulded ring with a small hole in it sits at the bottom of each
can. As the beer is poured in, the oxygen is removed and extra nitrogen
added, so that the pressure inside the can exceeds the atmospheric pressure
outside.
Once the can is sealed, the internal pressure forces beer and gas into the
ring at the bottom. When it is opened, the beer and gas is forced back out
through the hole, creating a stream of bubbles which rise to form the head
on the beer, just as with a draught pint.
Three years later, as Guinness Brewing Worldwide accepts its Queen's Award
for Technological Advancement, it considers the design a success. The award
reflects the introduction of a 'genuine innovation to the beer market',
according to managing director Mr Brian Baldock.
Some 120m cans of Guinness Draught have been sold, making it the sixth best
take-home variety by value on the market. Current sales are estimated to be
Pounds 45m a year.
There have been a series of minor modifications to both the technology and
the production of the draught can since it was first introduced, although
the company is coy about revealing details.
Drinkers have also had to learn the importance of preparing the beer before
serving: keeping it chilled in a refrigerator for at least two hours before
opening.
Canned Guinness Original, without the head created by the new device,
retains a larger market share than the draught. The original, a spokesman
explains, has a slightly more bitter taste, while the draught variety
appeals to newer converts to the Guinness brews and younger drinkers.
The company refuses to comment on current research projects and future
plans. Nevertheless, it has been keenly watching the market for bitter,
which makes up 50 per cent of beer sales in pubs but only 30 per cent of
those in cans.
Guinness has begun test marketing a new canned draft bitter using the same
'in-can' system. Trials began in several UK regions last month. 'We are
actively considering the potential of other markets', says Mr Baldock.

FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Export and Technology 1991: Firm
success with software - Synon and Systematica
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE skills of Synon of north London and Systematica of Bournemouth have won
them a Royal accolade for technology and a place among the world's software
elite.
Both have recently been named IBM 'business partners' in applications
software development, the only UK companies to be so honoured. IBM, the
world's largest software manufacturer, has appointed only five business
partners in this area; the other three are US companies. Indeed, IBM's
sponsorship of this fairly esoteric computing field gives it both legitimacy
and significance.
The Queen's Award is timely recognition of the UK industry's expertise in
this special and sophisticated software. Their products are called
computer-aided software engineering (Case) tools - in other words, computer
software which writes computer software.
The world computer industry, contrary to its high technology image, has been
backward at applying engineering disciplines to the business of software
production; computer programs are still developed in ways which owe more to
craft skills than to science, and as a result the software industry has a
woeful reputation for software which is delivered late, fails to work or
does not meet the customer's specification.
Synon and Systematica have developed software tools - special computer
programs - which help programmers to write applications programs more
quickly, more accurately and at less cost. Their approaches to the problem,
however, and the kind of case tools they have developed, are quite
different.
Synon (the name is derived from the 'please sign on' request which greets a
user when he or she turns the computer on) has developed a case tool called
Synon II specifically for IBM's most important current mid-range machine,
the AS/400. Synon II accelerates the development of software for the AS/400;
programs which typically take a day to produce can be written in an hour or
less using the tool.
The company was formed in 1983 by three people, Mr Simon Williams, now group
chairman, Ms Melinda Horton and Mr Nicholas Knowles. All three had been
working for a small software house developing bespoke applications for IBM
mid-range machines.
They were inspired by the idea of developing a application generator for
IBM's System/38 mid-range computer, an innovative machine so far ahead of
its time that it had not proved a huge commercial success. The Synon team
reasoned, however, that there was great potential in the design and that
there would be powerful demand for a good applications generator to match
it. Their faith was justified when IBM used the System/38 design as the
basis of the AS/400, a computer which is proving outstandingly successful,
generating an estimated Dollars 14bn in sales last year.
The level of funding necessary to develop Synon II was modest; the founders
of the company funded development out of income from providing computing
services and a capital injection of Pounds 50,000 from a satisfied customer,
the French Connection clothing group. French Connection sold out at the end
of 1989.
A key ingredient in the success of Synon was the opening of its US
operation; sales soared from Pounds 700,000 in 1986 to more than Pounds 2m
in 1987 and Pounds 7.2m in 1988, as US owners of AS/400 machines realised
that Synon II was the only software generator both available and tuned
specifically for their hardware. The company now has some 2,500 customers
around the world ranging from the Salvation Army to major banking groups.
Mr Williams says he believed that Synon was about 12 months ahead of the
opposition in the early days. He now thinks the margin is very much wider.
Only now are competitive products appearing and they seem to be much
narrower in scope than Synon II.
Synon's future seems relatively secure; IBM has just launched a new, more
powerful version of the AS/400 while Synon is moving into applications
software development using its own case tool. Its first target is an
accounting package.
A close relationship with IBM (and Digital Equipment and Hewlett Packard)
was part of Systematica's business plan when it was formed in 1986; that
wish was fulfilled in September 1990 when the US giant took a 20 per cent
stake in the company and announced it was appointing it a business partner.
Systematica is unusual even among case tool makers. It makes a case tool
called VSF, which is used to build other case tools. To use a manufacturing
analogy, Systematica makes the tools to make machine tools.
The company grew out of the frustration of the founders, Dr Andrew Wells, Mr
John Pocock and Mr John Nicholls, who discovered as engineers and managers
working for Plessey that the case tools they needed were not on the market.
Plessey decided not to invest in software tools development, so the three
secured Pounds 1.45m venture capital funding from Venture Link and a Pounds
350,000 Department of Trade and Industry grant and went into business for
themselves.
Dr Wells explains that world class case tools typically take Pounds 20m to
develop and have to be created to very exact specification for each industry
 -says telecommunications, submarine operations or commercial data
processing.
The Systematica team, with Mr John Pocock providing the theoretical
underpinning, reckoned they could use knowledge engineering - artificial
intelligence - to cut the cost of building the tools by up to 95 per cent
and making them available to the two million software engineers world wide
who could make use of such sophisticated aids.
Now Systematica's VSF has been licensed to IBM, Digital equipment, Informix,
Cognos and Information Builders, among others.
Customers include British Telecom, the European Space Agency and Barclays
Bank. The product has generated some Pounds 7m in revenues in three years.
VSF is a considerable piece of mathematical inventiveness, but its principal
virtue is high speed at low cost. Case tools exist which will do all that
VSF does - but at a price. They run chiefly on mainframe computers. Dr Wells
points out: 'No one else has managed to develop a case tool that runs fast
enough on a cheap work station'.

FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Export and Technology 1991: Treatment
gets under the skin for curing cancer - ICI Pharmaceuticals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI Pharmaceuticals, based in Alderley Park, Cheshire, has won a fourth
award for technological achievement. This year's award is for Zoladex, an
innovative prostate cancer treatment which is a step forward not only in
pharmaceutical chemistry but also in drug delivery technology.
Zoladex cannot be taken orally because it breaks down quickly in the
gastro-intestinal tract. It can be administered as a daily injection, but
ICI researchers did not consider this method to be suitable for long-term
use. Instead, they developed a sustained release formulation.
The active drug is dispersed in a small cylinder of biodegradable polymer,
about the size and colour of a rice grain. This 'depot' is injected under
the skin and then gradually releases the drug over a period of one month.
The patient - typically an elderly man - only has to visit his doctor once
every four weeks to have a new depot inserted.
Zoladex is a synthetic chemical analogue of a natural hormone, LHRH, which
is released by the hypothalamus and acts on the pituitary gland. It is much
more potent than LHRH and blocks the action of the natural hormone. This
interferes with a series of hormone-driven reactions in the body. The
outcome of Zoladex treatment is to stop the testes producing testosterone, a
male sex hormone.
Tumours of the prostate gland depend on testosterone to grow. If its
production stops, the cancer is effectively cured. This has traditionally
been achieved surgically by removing the testes. Zoladex brings about the
same effect chemically - and therefore avoids the psychological trauma and
medical risks of surgical castration.
ICI chemists first synthesised the active ingredient in Zoladex in 1976 and,
after initial biological tests had shown promising results, it entered the
development stage in 1978. But Zoladex was not launched commercially until
1987. This 11-year interval between discovery and marketing is about average
for the international pharmaceutical industry - and shows the long
timescales on which its R&amp;D strategists have to operate.
Zoladex is now on sale in more than 20 countries, including most major
pharmaceutical markets. Although its use so far has been for prostate
cancer, Zoladex has recently been approved for treating breast cancer in
several European countries and ICI is developing it for various other
hormone-related diseases.
ICI declines to disclose current or projected sales figures for Zoladex, but
some analysts believe that they could eventually reach Pounds 100m a year
for prostate cancer and a further Pounds 100m a year for breast cancer and
other diseases.
Last November ICI opened a Pounds 13.5m plant in Macclesfield, Cheshire, to
make Zoladex; demand has been so great that a Pounds 8.5m extension was
sanctioned before the main plant was complete. The whole factory will have
the capacity to make 2m monthly doses of Zoladex per year.
The development of Zoladex grew out of ICI's long-standing expertise in
hormone-based cancer treatments. Its anti-oestrogen breast cancer drug
Nolvadex, launched in 1973 and winner of a Queen's Award for Technological
Achievement in 1978, is now the world's best-selling cancer medicine.
Mr David Friend, chief executive of ICI Pharmaceuticals, says that cancer
therapy accounts for 'a large proportion' of the company's Pounds 200m a
year expenditure on drug research and development.
The pharmaceuticals business is currently the star performer of the ICI
group. The 1990 accounts show sales of Pounds 1.4bn and a trading profit of
Pounds 489m for ICI Pharmaceuticals; it accounted for only 11 per cent of
group turnover but contributed 47.5 per cent of profits. The company expects
further strong growth from ICI Pharmaceuticals this year, while its other
businesses remain mired in the depression affecting the general chemicals
industry.

entrepreneurial growth - Exploiting the enthusiasm for technology can be
rewarding

IN THE mid-1980s the entrepreneurial high technology start-up was seen as
the engine for Britain's economic growth. Now a clutch of small computing
and telecommunications companies which took advantage of that enthusiasm are
among the 1991 winners for the Queen's Awards for technology, and can stamp
their notepaper with the coveted logo.
'The mid-1980s was a time when the UK was very positive to the formation of
new companies', recalls Mr Geoffrey Manning, Chairman of AMT (Active Memory
Technology), of Reading.
He believes that the ideas enthusiastically propounded in Thatcherite
Britain fostered the establishment of high technology start-ups, such as his
own. 'It requires more than ideas to be successful. It needs people who are
willing to trust small companies without a track record,' he says. 'The
venture capitalists have to invest.'
When Mr Manning took up the post of AMT's chairman in 1986 he was joining a
company in which 60 per cent of the money came from venture capital
companies. A further 20 per cent had been invested by ICL, which also
provided the base technology for the digital array processor  - a computer
system which can process over 4,000 pieces of information simultaneously.
The confidence of the investors has paid off, with deliveries of the AMT
equipment to customers in the US and UK for both defence and commercial
applications.
Shareholders in software company Intelligent Applications, of Livingston
Village, in Scotland's 'silicon glen', can also afford themselves a quiet
smile. The company, which had start-up funding from fund managers Baillie
Gifford, was founded five years ago to develop industrial applications for
expert systems - computer systems which are programmed to emulate human
decision-making.
The company has been profitable for the past two years with over 300
companies in the US and UK using the Amethyst software - which diagnoses
faults in rotating machines by monitoring the vibrations. It is this
widespread use, says managing director Mr Robert Milne, which earned
Intelligent Applications the first Queen's Award for expert system
technology.
Two other 1980s software houses, Synon, of London, which was set up in 1983,
and Systematica, of Bournemouth founded in March 1986, were also among this
year's winners. Systematica was set up with Pounds 1.45m venture capital
funding from Venture Link and Pounds 350,000 from the DTI's grant coffers.
The liberalisation of the telecommunications marketplace, in particular the
licensing of companies to compete with British Telecom, proved a further
spur to Telsis, of Fareham, to develop its Hi-Call telephone system. Anyone
who calls up the latest share information, weather or horoscope phone
services could well be listening to information recorded on the Telsis unit.
The innovations for which Telsis won the Queen's Award are interactive
technology - by pressing certain buttons, certain options or courses can be
followed - and voice response technology. Systems are now available which
can recognise simple words, says Mr John Symes, sales and marketing director
of Telsis, and the company is pursuing further developments in this area.
Although Telsis was only set up in June 1987, it already had a turnover of
Pounds 6.9m last year.
For this year's smaller winners, all eager to make their mark in the 1990s,
there are few better companies to emulate than Quantel, the innovative
television production company. Quantel revolutionised coverage of sporting
events with its 'picture in picture' techniques, enabling two moving images
to be combined in the screen.
Although only in operation since the early 1970s, Quantel this year won its
seventh Queen's Award for technology - it also won an export award in 1980.
Quantel's Mr Dominic Lunney says this string of honours is a reflection on
the company's policy of continuing to innovate. 'This is not the kind of
field where you can rest on your laurels,' he says.
This year's award is for Quantel's Graphic Paintbox, an electronic pre-press
system used in printing and advertising for the manipulation of images.
Although this year's awards have marked the achievement Britain's industrial
heavyweights have also been roundly rewarded with GEC, ICI, and STC all
picking up Queen's Awards.
Telecommunications company GPT Payphones, now owned 60 per cent by GEC and
40 per cent by Siemens of Germany, won its first Queen's Award for
technology for public phone systems which take credit cards instead of cash.
As well as the phones GPT has developed the card validation unit - to check
that the credit card has not been stolen - and the charging unit to ensure
that the call charges are apportioned to the appropriate credit card
company.
'We have been instrumental in moving the payphone from being just a social
service to being a social service and a valuable tool for the businessman,'
says Mr Colin Beardmore, director of engineering at GPT Payphones.
The company's cashless phone systems, manufactured in a high-tech factory
nestling in the suburban area of Chorley, Liverpool, are installed as far
afield as Hong Kong, Moscow, Finland and Mexico, as well as the UK.
Other GEC companies to win technology awards are GEC Alsthom, of Stafford -
for thyristor valves used in power transmission - and the military
communications division of Marconi Communication Systems for its 'Scimitar
H' radio.
ICI scooped two awards, one for its Katalco company's catalysts and
absorbants used in the purification of hydrocarbons and carbon dioxides and
the second for its pharmaceutical division's 'Zoladex' drug, for treating
prostate cancer.
Britain's leading position in the world pharmaceuticals and medical
technology market led to seven other Queen's Awards for technology in the
health arena. The Royal Marsden Hospital in London, together with the
Johnson Matthey Technology Centre and the Royal Cancer Hospital, for
example, won its award for platinum anti-cancer drugs, while the central
research division of Pfizer was honoured for its development of a drug to
treat systemic fungal infections, especially in cancer and Aids patients.
Pharmaceuticals company SmithKline Beecham was singled out for its
development of 'Eminase', the clot-buster. Because the drug can be injected
intravenously to treat heart attack victims quickly - they do not have to
admitted to hospital before it can be administered - SKB believes Eminase
could save up to 10,000 lives a year in the UK alone.
More mundane, perhaps, but bringing considerable quality of life
improvements to patients is a colostomy bag which can be flushed down the
lavatory. It won its developers, Eschmann Bros and Walsh, of West Sussex, a
1991 Queen's award. A sensing device used for recording the movements of
patients over long periods - comprising a flexible stainless steel wire with
a number of sensors attached - brought a similar award to the biometrics
division of Penny and Giles.
Bede Scientific Instruments and a combination of Bio-Rad and the Medical
Research Council both won awards for scientific instruments - in the case of
Bio-Rad for a special laser scanning imaging system which enables scientists
and medical researchers to study the components of cells.
As ever, the Queen's Awards have thrown up a myriad of industrial
developments, from composite aircraft propellers (Dowty Aerospace) and parts
for aircraft gas turbine engines (TI Reynolds) to machinery for textile
producers (Fibreguide) and ceramic inking rolls for the printing industry
(Sandon Flexographic Printing Rollers).
A computer system developed by Foseco, of Tamworth, Staffordshire, to
simulate the processes which take place in the metals casting industry, won
its inventors an award,while Portals, of Basingstoke, won fame for its
metallised plastic strip which provides the windowed thread in bank notes.
Oxford Magnet Technology was honoured for the development of 'active shield'
magnets, to reduce stray magnetic fields; Anson for a swivel joint for use
in steel piping systems for oil and gas fields; and Wood Group Production
Technology for oilwell instrumentation.
Three of the Redland group of companies got together to pick up a technology
award for the development of the Cambrian interlocking slate. Although they
look like traditional roof slates they contain only 65 per cent natural
slate, combined with stone, resin and glass fibre. This makes them lighter
and easier to use, as well as cutting the costs to the home owner.
And although it may not be politic to drink and drive, two companies have
been given Queen's Awards for - separately - doing just that.
Guinness Brewing, of London, has won its award for a canning system which
enabled the company to promise that beer as good as the draught variety
could be made available in cans.
BSH Industries, of Manchester has developed a heating element for a car's
rear window which can also act as a radio aerial system - enabling drivers
to listen to the latest chat show while demisting the windows at the same
time.
