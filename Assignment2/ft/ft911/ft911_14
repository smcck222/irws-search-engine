FT  18 APR 91 / The Finance Bill: Higher relief on dereliction costs -
Oil/Gas Companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Finance Bill has broadened the definition of the expenditure made by oil
and gas companies in abandoning North Sea production platforms that
qualifies for relief from Petroleum Revenue Tax.
Although the bill will not have a big effect on the main operators - since
it merely tightens up the wording of existing legislation rather than
altering the spirit of the law - it once again raises the controversial
issue of what oil companies do when a North Sea field runs out of oil.
Companies have not yet tested government legislation on abandoning
installations because North Sea fields have only just started to run dry.
The bill announced yesterday broadens the rules on tax relief for
abandonment which means that companies will be able to write off all the
costs incurred against tax.
It also stipulates that partners in an oil or gas field which obtain bank
guarantees against one partner's defaulting on the cost of abandoning that
field can write off the cost of getting that guarantee against tax.
At the same time, if an oil company has to pick up the cost of abandonment
for a defaulting partner, it can also obtain tax relief on that payment as
well as on its own share of the costs of abandonment.
Government rules state that oil companies must return the sea bed to its
natural state once they have finished producing oil or gas. This means, at
least in theory, that they have to recover the immense production platform,
drag it onshore and break it up. After that, they must plug the well heads
with concrete to prevent oil leakages.
The cost of this operation could run into billions of pounds and as it is
entirely allowable against Petroleum Revenue Tax - which runs at 75 per cent
 -the government could end up footing three-quarters of the bill. For this
reason, many big oil companies privately believe that when it comes to it,
the government will allow them just to blow up the rig and leave it.
Occidental Petroleum was given a special concession to topple the damaged
Piper Alpha rig into the sea after the explosion that killed 167 men.
But there are at least six fields that look as though they may run out of
oil in the next four years and are not making much of a profit now - which
means they could be abandoned at any time. On Friday, a House of Commons
select committee will publish a report on abandonment after hearing evidence
from oil companies, fishermen and environmental lobbyists.

FT  18 APR 91 / The Finance Bill: Benefits from a wider definition - Debt
and Equity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM GAMMIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TAX system distinguishes debt from equity in a variety of ways. Most
clearly, dividends and interest are treated differently, both for the paying
company and the recipient investor. The difference in form, however, does
not necessarily reflect any difference in economic substance: fixed rate
preference shares can look more like debt, and certain debts, such as
non-recourse loans or borrowings where the rate of interest depends on the
results of the borrower's business, can be more akin to equity.
The different treatment of debt and equity distorts the financing decisions
of companies. Having created the distinction, the tax system seeks in places
to undo it, for example, by treating interest in certain cases as if it were
a dividend. However, in its present form, the system can do little to
counter the basic attraction of debt compared with equity.
Related problems arise where special reliefs are available between a parent
and its subsidiary companies. These enable the losses of one company to be
set against the profits of another, dividends to be paid without ACT and
capital assets to be transferred without tax charge. To take advantage of
such reliefs the companies must establish the requisite common ownership.
This is done through ownership by one company of a particular percentage of
the equity of another, entitling the owner to that percentage of the
dividends and assets of the other company. This is designed to identify the
true owners of the underlying profits and assets of the company.
Accordingly, 'equity' for these purposes does not include fixed rate
preference shares. But debt may be counted as equity unless the debt is a
'normal commercial loan'. It can be important, therefore, for a subsidiary
company to ensure that a third party loan qualifies as a normal commercial
loan. If not, it may cease to be entitled to the benefits of the group
provisions between itself and its parent or sister subsidiaries, as its
parent may cease to own the required percentage of its equity.
A change in the definition of a normal commercial loan set out in the
Finance Bill goes some way to ensuring that genuine borrowings can be made
on the commercially desired terms without jeopardising reliefs.
Up to now, a loan was not a normal commercial one where it provided for the
interest rate to fall as the borrower's results improved. Similarly, certain
limited or non-recourse loans secured on particular assets were not regarded
as normal commercial loans.
Now certain of these loans will qualify as 'normal commercial loans'.
However, the changes are limited: a loan where the interest rate falls as
the business or asset values improve is 'normal', but not if the rate can
increase as the business or asset values deteriorate. Similarly, a
non-recourse loan secured on investment land is 'normal', but not
necessarily one secured on other assets.

FT  18 APR 91 / The Finance Bill: Cut-price option for share schemes - ESOPS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST mouth watering provision in the Finance Bill for many directors
will be clause 37, which gives companies the opportunity to grant options
under an Inland Revenue approved executive share scheme at a 15 per cent
discount to market price.
This cut-price option facility will only be available to companies which
also have an approved all-employee incentive scheme - either a profit
sharing or an SAYE option scheme. Simply setting up a wider scheme will not
be sufficient. The company will also have to notify all eligible employees
of the scheme's existence in the 12 months immediately preceding the grant
of options.
The time for determining which employees are eligible is the date on which
the executive rights are created. This creates a potential trap.
Participation in most wider schemes is restricted to those who have
completed a qualifying period of service. If there is a significant interval
between despatch of the all-employee notice and grant of the executive
options, some employees are likely to become eligible during that period.
Failure to communicate with these new qualifiers will scupper the
executives' arrangements.
No individual can be granted an executive option over shares worth more than
four times his or her salary. Since this limit operates by reference to
market value rather than to the subscription price payable by the option
holder, the grant of discounted options will not increase the number of
shares which can be taken up.
For example, a director earning Pounds 50,000 a year is subject to a Pounds
200,000 option ceiling so that if the shares are worth Pounds 1 each he can
be allotted 200,000. Discounted at 15 per cent, the same shares will cost
him only Pounds 170,000, but since the shares are worth the full Pounds
200,000 he will be deemed to have reached his limit.
Finally, the bill puts beyond doubt that any company wishing to offer this
incentive will first have to amend its scheme rules. For quoted companies
shareholder approval will almost invariably be required.
There will be plenty of time to convene the necessary meeting - discounted
options cannot be handed out before January 1 1992. Companies may also need
time to canvass their institutional shareholders who are aware of the
potential cost of cheap options and are therefore likely to suggest that
such options should only be exercisable if performance targets are achieved.

FT  18 APR 91 / The Finance Bill: Foreign companies set to benefit from
change - VAT Group Treatment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MANY foreign companies
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
particularly in the financial services sector  - will benefit from the
change to the regulations concerning VAT treatment for groups of companies.
These should make company accounting more convenient and should ease cash
flow.
Following Royal Assent, an overseas company will be eligible for VAT group
treatment if it has an established place of business in the UK, rather than
if it is resident.
The advantage of VAT group treatment is that it allows groups of associated
companies to account for VAT under a single registration number. It means
that VAT does not have to be accounted for on transactions between such
associated companies. The amendment is intended to reduce the administrative
burden on companies.
At present, a foreign company - for example a bank with a London branch
which is active in various areas in financial services - is not allowed VAT
group treatment unless it is resident in the UK.
Many foreign companies cannot meet this residency qualification because it
means that at least one director with full voting rights has to be resident
in the UK.

Excise duty
Clause 1 (1) increases the excise duty on spirits; (2) increases the excise
duty on beer; (3) and Schedule 1 increases the excise duty on wine and
made-wine; (4) increases the excise duty on cider.
Clause 2 increases the excise duty on cigarettes, cigars, hand rolling
tobacco and other smoking and chewing tobacco.
Clause 3 (1) increases the rate of excise duty on petrol and derv; (2)
increases the excise duty on fuel oil and gas oil by amending the rebate
payable; (3) increases the excise duty on unleaded petrol by amending the
rebate payable; (4) increases the rate of excise duty on furnace oil by
amending the rebate payable.
Clause 4 Introduces a single rate of vehicle excise duty (Pounds 50) for
tricycles, increases the rate of VED by up to Pounds 10 for 900,000 motor
cycles, by Pounds 14 for 385,000 special machines and by Pounds 25 for
20,000 recovery vehicles. The changes affect licences taken out after March
19 1991.
Clause 5 (1) reduces the half-yearly fixed licence fee of gaming
establishments to Pounds 10; (2) amends the payment arrangements for gaming
licence duty payable by casinos, and; (3) increases the new gross gaming
yield thresholds for calculating the main charge to gaming licence duty.
Clause 6 Schedule 2 introduces a new system for charging duty on beer based
on the alcoholic strength of the finished product.
Clause 7 exempts all mine rescue vehicles from VED from March 20 1991.
Exempts pedestrian-controlled mowing machines from licensing and
registration. Removes exemption from licensing for non-operational fire
engines from June 1 1991. Removes redundant exemption from licensing for
civil defence vehicles with effect from October 1991.
Clause 8 provides the transport secretary with powers to make refunds of VED
to vehicles over 3,500 kg travelling by train between member states in
combined transport operations.
Clause 9 and Schedule 3 Parts I and II repeals the Vehicle (Excise) Act 1972
(Northern Ireland) and extends the Vehicle (Excise) Act 1971 to encompass
Northern Ireland. Consolidated act to come into force on a day to be
appointed by the secretary of state by order made by statutory instrument.
Clause 10 and Schedule 4 introduce a new type of trader, to be known as a
registered excise dealer and shipper (Reds), who may import and pay excise
duty on goods from another EC member state without having to submit customs
entries for clearance of the goods. This measure will be introduced from
royal assent to the Finance Bill although registration as a Reds will not
commence until 1992 in preparation for the completion of the single market
in 1993.
VAT inspection
Clause 11 and Schedule 5 extend to excise duties the powers officers already
have to inspect commercial records for VAT purposes, in preparation for the
completion of the single market in 1993.
Clause 12 Increases the rate of value added tax to 17.5 per cent with effect
from April 1 1991.
Clause 13 states that input tax may continue to be reclaimed by a business
where the supply of goods and services, specificed by Treasury order, is
provided direct to an employee for use in the course of that business. This
is already current practice, where road fuel is paid for by a mileage
allowance, but will by placed on a statutory basis by means of a Treasury
Order to be laid after royal assent.
Clause 14 reduces the waiting period for recovering value added tax on bad
debts from two years to one. This amendment will be deemed always to have
had effect.
Clause 15 extends the Value Added Tax Act 1983 to permit overseas companies,
established in the UK, to be a member of a value added tax group without the
requirement for a resident director in the UK.
Clause 16 introduces a statutory right for taxpayers to receive interest in
cases where an error on the part of Customs &amp; Excise has resulted in loss of
funds to them.
Clause 17 introduces a reduction in the rate of the Serious Misdeclaration
Penalty from 30 per cent to 20 per cent.
Clause 18 extends the relief from car tax for cars supplied for leasing to
the disabled for at least three years, to leases which end within this
period - when the lessor is a charity. This will become operative from royal
assent.
Clause 19 Proposes to allow relief from car tax on cars used by registered
car tax traders for research and development purposes only. This puts on to
a statutory basis a long-standing concession.
Clause 20 provides for unchanged basic and higher rates of income tax (at 25
and 40 per cent respectively) and for the basic rate limit to be set at
Pounds 23,700 for 1991-92.
Clause 21 provides for the married couple's allowance to remain unchanged
(at Pounds 1,720) for 1991-92.
Clause 22 reduces the main rate of corporation tax for the financial year
1990 from 35 per cent to 34 per cent. It also sets the fraction used for
calculating marginal relief at nine four-hundredths (equivalent to a
marginal rate for marginal relief of 36.25 per cent).
Clause 23 sets the main rate of corporation tax for the financial year 1991
at 33 per cent.
Clause 24 sets the small companies' rate of corporation tax for the
financial year 1991 at 25 per cent and sets the fraction used for
calculating marginal relief at one-fiftieth (equivalent to a marginal rate
for marginal relief of 35 per cent). It also increases the ceiling for the
small companies' rate from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 250,000 and the ceiling
for marginal relief from Pounds 1,000,000 to Pounds 1,250,000.
Clause 25 sets the limit for mortgage interest relief (and relief for home
annuity loans for the elderly) for 1991-92 at Pounds 30,000 (unchanged).
Mortgage tax relief
Clause 26 restricts tax relief on mortgage interest payments made on or
after April 6 1991 to the basic rate of income tax both for loans not in
Miras and for loans in Miras. Schedule 6 makes changes to the rules for
taxing the benefit arising from beneficial loans made to employees by virtue
of their employment. The main changes are consequential to the removal of
higher rate relief for mortgage interest payments (Clause 26). The schedule
also corrects technical defects in the calculation of cash equivalents of
beneficial loans for employees who have both loans on which the interest
qualifies for tax relief and other loans at different rates of interest.
Clause 27 removes the requirement that to be eligible for mortgage tax
relief a caravan should either be: (i) 'large' (more than 22ft long or more
than 7ft 6in wide), or (ii) a 'rateable hereditament'.
Clause 28 sets the car benefit scale charges for 1991-92. These are 20 per
cent higher than the scale charges for 1990-91.
Clause 29 provides for an income tax charge on a standard amount of Pounds
200 from April 6 1991 on the benefit derived by employees from the private
use of each mobile telephone provided by employers. There will be no charge
if there is no private use by the employee or if the employee is required
to, and does, make good the whole cost of any private use.
Clause 30 increases from Pounds 200 to Pounds 300 the de minimis limit for
taxing benefits arising on loans made to employees by virtue of their
employment.
Clause 31 introduces the new tax relief for vocational training which will
apply from 6 April 1992.
Clause 32 empowers the Board of Inland Revenue to make regulations for the
administration of the tax relief for vocational training provided by Clause
31.
Pension schemes
Clause 33 amends the conditions for mandatory approval of occupational
pension schemes by adjusting the allowable retirement ages; and by removing
an inconsistency between tax and social security requirements.
Clause 34 extends, to existing approved occupational pension schemes, the
effect of any regulations made after April 17 1991 which restrict the
conditions on which discretionary tax approval may be granted.
Clause 35 clarifies the present provisions dealing with withdrawal of tax
approval from, and alterations to, occupational pension schemes. The clause
is deemed always to have had effect.
Clause 36 doubles (subject to unchanged limits) the rate of tax after April
1 1991 in establishing employee share ownership plan (Esop) trusts which
satisfy the qualifying conditions laid down in the Taxes Acts.
Clause 37 permits options under a discretionary employee share option scheme
approved by the Inland Revenue to be granted at a discount of up to 15 per
cent of the market value of the shares. The measure takes effect from
January 1992.
Clause 38 increases, from a date to be fixed by Treasury order, the limit on
the size of share options which may be granted to individual participants in
an approved all-employee savings-related share option scheme. The limit,
expressed in terms of monthly savings, is increased from Pounds 150 to
Pounds 250.
Clause 39 increases the limit on annual appropriations of free shares to
individual participants in an approved all-employee profit-sharing scheme.
The limit is increased to the greater of Pounds 3,000 or 10 per cent of
salary (subject to a ceiling of Pounds 8,000).
Clause 40 provides a tax relief for the costs which companies incur on or
after April 1 1991 in setting up employee share schemes approved by the
Inland Revenue.
Clause 41 provides a tax relief for the costs which companies incur in
establishing employee share ownership plan (Esop) trusts which satisfy the
qualifying conditions laid down in the Taxes Acts.
Clause 42 extends the income tax exemption for directors and employees who
benefit from being given priority rights in a public offer of shares. From
January 16 1991, the exemption is extended to cover circumstances in which
the public offer comprises a package of shares in two or more companies. The
clause also extends from the same date the existing exemption for 'special
benefits', such as bonus shares, in respect of shares acquired under such a
public offer but outside an approved employee share scheme.
Clause 43 increases, from April 6 1991, the limits on the availability of
tax relief for the foreign earnings of seafarers who work abroad for a
qualifying period of 365 days.
Clause 44 extends the tax relief for foreign earnings so that employees in
Kuwait and Iraq forced to return to the UK early because of the Gulf crisis,
or unable to return to those countries because of it, qualify for relief
from UK tax on their foreign earnings up to the date of their return to the
UK.
Clause 45 extends the relief insurance companies get for levies imposed
under investor protection schemes. Payments made already under statutory
schemes qualify for relief. Provision is made to extend relief, by
regulations, to non-statutory schemes.
Clause 46 and Schedule 7 bring forward insurance companies' entitlement to
repayment of tax on exempt pension business income. They will be able to
claim back the tax in the year in which the income is received rather than
having to wait until their overall tax liability is agreed. The change will
be phased in from a date, to be specified in regulations, linked to the
introduction of Pay and File planned for 1993.
Clause 47 and Schedule 8 raise from Pounds 150 to Pounds 200 the annual
premium limit for tax-exempt policies issued by friendly societies.
Clause 48 and Schedule 9 change the tax rules for existing building society
shares to deal with a new form of share: permanent interest bearing shares
(Pibs). They exempt sterling-denominated Pibs from tax on capital gains;
bring Pibs into the accrued income scheme; give relief for the incidental
costs of issuing Pibs; and prevent capital gains arising where Pibs are
issued to existing building society members on preferential terms.
Clause 49 and Schedule 10 ensure that interest on building societies' Pibs
will be paid after deduction of income tax at the basic rate, and that
building societies will not get relief for any interest on Pibs that exceeds
normal commercial interest.
Clause 50 provides that interest and dividends paid by building societies to
investors during transitional periods leading up to the 1986 change in the
system of accounting for composite rate tax may be charged to tax at rates
in force for 1985-86.
Clause 51 and Schedule 11 make technical changes to the accrued income
scheme and the deep discount and deep gain legislation to deal with the
issue of securities in tranches. Accrued interest included in the issue
price of securities will qualify for relief under the accrued income scheme.
Tax relief for the interest paid by the issuer will be restricted to the
amount taxable in the hands of the subscriber. The definition of 'issue
price' for determining deep discount/deep gain securities will exclude any
accrued interest. The changes apply to securities issued on or after March
19 1991.
Clause 52 relaxes the anti-bondwashing rules, so that the six-month period
during which a charge can arise when securities such as shares are bought or
sold using options will generally be reduced to one month.
Overseas securities
Clause 53 (and associated regulations to be made later in the year) change
the rules governing the lending of overseas securities. They will enable a
lending chain of more than three parties without a tax charge arising on the
resulting disposals.
Clause 54 and Schedule 12 provide for arrangements to govern the accounting
for tax on manufactured dividends and interest paid as compensation for
non-receipt of the real dividends or interest (for example, by a borrower to
a lender of securities). Broadly, manufactured dividends and interest will
be treated in the same way as their real counterparts.
Clause 55 and Schedule 13 adapt the capital allowances system to take
account of retrospective adjustments made, under the VAT Capital Goods
Scheme, to the amount of VAT payable on certain capital assets.
Clause 56 extends capital allowances to expenditure on the construction of
toll roads. Relief will be given through the industrial buildings code of
allowances at 4 per cent per annum.
Clause 57 provides corporation tax relief to an oilfield participator for
expenditure incurred on or after March 19 1991 in obtaining an abandonment
guarantee (defined in Clause 90). In the event of a guarantee being called
it also denies relief to any participator in the field for expenditure met
out of the payment by the guarantor.
Clause 58 restores corporation tax relief where a defaulting oil field
participator reimburses a guarantor who has been called upon to meet the
participator's liability to contribute to oil field abandonment costs.
Clause 59 provides corporation tax relief to an oil field participator for
any expenditure which it is obliged to meet after June 30 1991 on behalf of
a defaulting co-participator which has failed to meet its own share of the
cost of abandoning the field.
Clause 60 restores corporation tax relief where a defaulting oilfield
participator reimburses a co-participator which has been required to meet
the defaulter's share of field abandonment expenditure. It also provides for
the reimbursement to be treated as ring fence income for corporation tax
purposes in the hands of the non-defaulter.
Clause 61 makes a minor technical correction to the rules dealing with the
interaction between capital gains and capital allowances for oil licences
relating to undeveloped areas. It restores a cross-reference to scientific
research allowances which was omitted from the 1990 Capital Allowances
Consolidation Act.
Clause 62 paves the way for regulations, to be made in the autumn, enabling
investors to have both a single company Pep and a general Pep in the same
year.
Clause 63 removes the upper limits on single charitable donations by
individuals or companies which qualify for income tax or corporation tax
relief. The change applies to donations made on or after March 19 1991.
Clause 64 enables proprietors of unincorporated businesses to set their
trading losses against their capital gains, for the year in which the loss
is made or the following year.
Clause 65 increases the limits for tax exemption enjoyed by trade unions and
employers' associations which pay provident benefits. The limit for gross
sums increases from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 4,000 and the limit for annuities
increases from Pounds 625 to Pounds 825.
Clause 66 amends the definition of a normal commercial loan for certain tax
purposes. It deals with loans where the rate of interest reduces when the
results of the debtor company's business improve or the value of its assets
increase. It also deals with limited recourse loans based on land not used
for dealing.
Clause 67 updates one of the rules that remove tax obstacles to the
conversion of a building society to a plc, to take account of the abolition
of composite rate tax.
Clause 68 amends Schedule 11 of the Electricity Act 1989 to ensure that all
interest paid on debentures issued under that act is tax-deductible.
Clause 69 widens the terms of the present exemption of UK investment
managers acting on behalf of non-resident clients.
False declaration
Clause 70 introduces a penalty where someone makes a false declaration in
order to receive deposit interest without deduction of income tax, or
deliberately fails to inform the building society, bank etc, that he or she
has become liable to income tax.
Clauses 71 to 80 make a number of changes to the taxation of non-resident
trusts, including imposition of a charge to capital gains tax when a
settlement ceases to be resident in the UK on or after 19 March 1991.
Clause 81 changes from one acre to half a hectare the maximum amount of land
which can normally qualify for capital gains tax private residence relief.
Clause 82 provides that the last three years (previously the last two years)
that an individual owns a property which has at any time been his or her
home will automatically continue to qualify for relief from capital gains
tax. The Treasury will have the power to change the period back from three
to two years and vice versa in future. The clause also increases the maximum
special exemption available to individuals who let part or all of their home
from Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 40,000.
Clause 83 confirms that the capital gains legislation governing transactions
between the Housing Corporation and housing associations should apply
equally to Housing for Wales.
Clause 84 makes a correction to the rules allowing capital gains on foreign
assets to be deferred where they cannot be remitted to the United Kingdom.
It makes it clear that the relief is available where the unremittability
arises in the country where the assets are situated.
Clause 85 makes minor changes to the capital gains tax rules which exempt
Qualifying Corporate Bonds so that bonds convertible into other corporate
bonds are exempt and bonds convertible into shares or securities of the
issuing company's quoted parent are not exempt.
Clause 86 provides that shares acquired between April 6 1982 and April 5
1983 under the Business Start-up Scheme are no longer to be pooled with
other shares for capital gains tax purposes.
Clause 87 reduces the qualifying age for capital gains tax retirement relief
from 60 to 55; and increases the exemption ceilings so that all of the first
Pounds 150,000 (previously Pounds 125,000) and half of the next Pounds
450,000 (previously Pounds 375,000) of gains are exempt from capital gains
tax. The changes apply to disposals made on or after March 19 1991.
Clause 88 corrects minor defects in the capital gains tax rebasing rules.
Clause 89 replaces the existing definition of oilfield abandonment costs
allowable for petroleum revenue tax (PRT) purposes with a broader definition
(also covering relevant land and seabed restoration costs) for expenditure
incurred after June 30 1991. A rule is provided for apportioning costs
between oilfields where appropriate; and PRT relief is made available to
oilfield participators for expenditure incurred on or after March 19 1991 in
obtaining an abandonment guarantee (defined in Clause 90).
Clause 90 defines an 'abandonment guarantee' for the purpose of Clauses 57,
58, 89, 91 and 92. For relief purposes an abandonment guarantee is a
guarantee obtained by an oilfield participator from an unconnected third
party to cover the participator's share of the costs of abandoning the
field.
Clause 91 precludes PRT relief for oilfield expenditure met out of a payment
by a guarantor under the terms of an abandonment guarantee taken out by a
field participator.)
Clause 92 restores PRT relief where a defaulting oil field participator
reimburses a guarantor who has been called upon to meet the participator's
liability to contribute to oil field abandonment costs.
Clause 93 provides PRT relief to an oil field participator for any
expenditure which it is required to meet after June 30 1991 on behalf of a
defaulting co-participator which has failed to meet its own share of the
cost of abandoning the field.
Clause 94 restores PRT relief where a defaulting oilfield participator
reimburses a co-participator which has been required to meet the defaulter's
share of field abandonment expenditure. It also provides for the
reimbursement to be treated as a PRT chargeable receipt in the hands of the
non-defaulter.
PRT penalties
Clause 95 removes doubts over the law on enforcing PRT penalties.
Clause 96: Amendment of Government Trading Act 1990. The purpose of clause
is to correct a technical defect in the way the order-making powers work in
relation to establishing the values of assets and liabilities under the
Government Trading Funds Act 1973 as amended by the Government Trading Act
1990.
Clause 97: National Savings - repayments to customers. This clause validates
certain payments to National Savings customers. National Savings has
followed a long-standing practice of dating repayment warrants for the
expected date of receipt, which has also been the date used for valuing the
amounts to be repaid, and for other rights such as participation in Premium
Bond prize draws. National Savings received legal advice last year that some
of their regulations required repayments to be valued for the day on which
they were posted.
The necessary amending regulations to validate National Savings' practice
came into force on February 11 1991. Finance Bill provision is necessary to
cover the period before that date.

FT  18 APR 91 / Business Law: Light at end of Europe's software tunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN NAPIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME THREE years after the publication of its green paper on the legal
protection of computer programs, the European Commission is within sight of
realising its grand objective.
Following an intense exchange of views involving manufacturers, Community
institutions, and diverse interest groups, the Council of Ministers last
December unanimously adopted a common position with regard to the
Commission's proposed directive setting out the principles for copyright
protection for software.
The parliament has this week given second consideration to the directive
embodying the council's common position. Barring accidents the proposed
directive should be ready for adoption by the summer. Changes in domestic
law to comply with the new standards will have to be in place by January
1993.
The proposed directive is readily recognisable to anyone familiar with the
UK's Copyright Patents and Design Act 1988, which itself provided the model
for many of the individual provisions.
Computer programs are classed as literary works, and are granted copyright
protection provided they pass a test of 'originality' (ie, not copied). The
copyright holder (developer) is given a clutch of 'exclusive rights', the
most important of which is the right to reproduce, adapt and distribute to
the public the work which the program constitutes.
Control ceases, however, when a copy of the program is sold, so that
post-sale distribution of that copy is left to the purchaser's will - except
in the case of rental to the public, where a specific exemption is made.
The piracy of computer programs will thus, under Community law, be equated
with the illicit copying of books, sheet music, films or other works already
regulated by copyright.
Given the value of the software market to Europe - about Dollars 40bn in
1989 and employing more than 300,000 workers - this looks like a big step.
However, all EC countries already acknowledge the intellectual property
rights of software developers under their domestic law. Thus the real
advance made by the directive lies not so much in giving protection, but in
the harmonisation of these different national laws, to create the 'level
playing field' judged necessary for the completion of the internal market.
At the heart of the controversy over the proposed directive lies the problem
of reconciling conflicting interests. The Community needs a stable legal
environment in which the European software industry can continue to thrive.
In particular, clear rules are needed to specify the extent to which a
program developed by one software producer can be copied, adapted or limited
by another developer or user. The Community institutions, like the member
states and all other developed countries, have settled on copyright
protection as the best mechanism for striking a fair and realistic balance
between developers, competitors and users.
To be sure, the accepted principles of copyright law have had to be modified
to take the special status of software into account. For example, the making
of back-up copies of programs (which could in principle be prohibited under
the conditions on which software is marketed) is, under the proposed
directive, given as an unqualified right to users where a back-up is
necessary for the use of the program. But the core principles of copyright
provide the basis for the regime being put forward for approval.
One issue vigorously debated in the run-up to the council's common position
was whether there should be a specific exception to copyright protection to
allow a process called 'decompilation'.
This involves taking a program to bits in order to see how it is made and
works. Because decompilation means that one or more copies or translations
of the program being studied have to be made, the activity could involve a
breach of copyright by those who engage in it. Therefore, it has been
argued, a specific exception should be enacted in the directive to
legitimate such behaviour. Some believe that decompilation is necessary in
order to achieve 'inter-operability' - ie, making different programs work
together.
At the same time, however, decompilation also makes it much easier for a
competitor to develop a rival program - in effect, a disguised copy. Where
decompilation is improperly used, it allows a competitor to produce a low
cost imitation by avoiding the development expense that the original creator
has incurred.
After the Commission first published its proposal for a directive, some
manufacturers and developers urged the addition of a broad exception
allowing a decompilation without the permission of the copyright holder.
Others argued that such an exception, lacking adequate safeguards, would
have posed a great risk to both large and small innovative European software
houses that are a key engine of software competition in the Community.
A novel program achieves market acceptance because it satisfied a user need.
That stimulates competitors to try to imitate its functions. Because the
independent writing of such imitative programs takes time, the initial
innovator has a window of opportunity to reap a fair return on the costs and
risks of writing the original program.
If competitors were allowed to take a short cut to developing imitative
programs by decompiling original software, the window of opportunity for the
innovators to earn a fair return on their investments would narrow. The law
would favour imitation over innovation - a formula for stagnation of the
sector.
The compromise adopted in the council's common position is, first, to allow
decompilation but, second, to limit the purpose for which it can be
undertaken. Specifically, decompilation can be performed only for the goal
of enabling independently created programs to interwork with each other.
The copyright owner's permission is not needed where the reproduction of the
code is indispensable as a means to achieving this result, provided:
the act is done by the person having a right to use a copy of the program;
the information necessary to achieve inter-operability has not previously
been made available; and
the acts are confined to those parts of the original program which are
necessary to achieve inter-operability with it.
Furthermore, the information so gained may not be used except for the
purpose of achieving intero-perability; it must not be given to others
(except where necessary for interoperability); and it may not be used for
the 'development, production of marketing' of a program substantially
similar to the original program.
The compromise represented by the council's views on the decompilation
exception continues to embody a measure of risk for software producers.
Whether or not this exception to traditional copyright principles will open
the door to piracy remains to be seen. Despite this, the directive should go
far in providing within Europe the safeguards which are needed to sustain
lengthy and expensive software development projects.
Whether the council-Commission common position achieves a fair balance
between competing interests remains a matter of opinion, but the time has
surely come to close a debate that has raged for well over a year.
No one can claim that the issues have not been properly ventilated, and the
industry now deserves a rest from continued squabbling and recriminations.
Should there be a case of an abuse of a dominant trading position by the
industry giants, as some have argued, then the Commission has other weapons
of Community law (Articles 85, 86) at hand to combat this.
As far as the UK is concerned, the balanced approach of the present version
of the software directive appears to be in line with the approach taken to
copyright protection in the 1988 act. Thus, adoption of the directive might
not require extensive legislative amendment in Britain.

FT  18 APR 91 / Safety of tap water questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRINKING water in some areas might pose 'a significant risk to health'
because the government has secretly allowed privatised water companies to
relax standards, Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's shadow minister for environmental
protection, alleged yester-day.
She claimed some companies had been allowed 'blanket relaxations of toxic
and microbiological standards'.
Mr David Trippier, minister of state for the environment, denied the claim
and accused Mrs Taylor of 'the worst sort of scaremongering'.
He said: 'All drinking water supplied in this country is safe to drink.'
The Water Services Association, which represents the privatised water
companies, said: 'None of the water supplied breaches safe limits as
determined by the government's independent medical advisers.'
The association said a few unsatisfactory water supplies had been identified
and undertakings to put them right had been made public in 1989. Work was
being carried out to the timetable agreed, it added.
Labour intends to bring the matter to the attention of the European
Commission to check whether the water companies are in breach of the EC
water directive.

FT  18 APR 91 / Ruling may save Names up to Pounds 17m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 400 Names (members of Lloyd's) on the troubled Pulbrook syndicate
90 may save as much as Pounds 17m as a result of a ruling yesterday by an
independent arbitrator on the validity of a Lloyd's reinsurance run-off
contract placed by the syndicate in 1982 with another Lloyd's syndicate.
The Names have already paid losses of more than Pounds 34m (just over 200
per cent of the stamp capacity) for the 'open' 1982 year of account but
still face further potential losses of up to Pounds 90m.
Last week 306 Pulbrook 90 Names served writs against the syndicate's
managing agents, Names' members' agents and brokers, alleging that
negligence was responsible for their losses.
The Names' losses would have been increased by 50 per cent had the
arbitration case gone against Pulbrook.
The disputed reinsurance contract covered US liabilities insured by Pulbrook
before 1974.
Claims on such so-called 'long-tail' policies arise many years after the
policy inception.
Pulbrook 90, now owned by Merrett Underwriting Agencies, was a leading
underwriter of such insurances in Lloyd's in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.
Claims from asbestosis victims have led to huge losses on the policies.
Meacock syndicate 727, which wrote 20 per cent of the reinsurance policy in
January 1982, contested its validity on the ground that there had been
material non-disclosure by Pulbrook.
Sir Michael Kerr, QC, the arbitrator, ruled that a run-off reinsurance
contract placed with two groups of Lloyd's syndicates was valid.
Outhwaite syndicate 317/661, which wrote 50 per cent of the run-off policy,
had agreed a settlement outside the arbitration procedure.
Pulbrook was unable to place the remaining 30 per cent of the policy.

FT  18 APR 91 / Lloyd's agrees on computer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARTICIPANTS ON the London insurance market yesterday announced agreement on
a new system based on electronic communication and designed to harmonise the
way brokers place risks with syndicates at Lloyd's and insurance companies.
Live use of the system is expected to begin in April 1992. It should help to
improve the efficiency of the market and to reduce costs at a time when
profitability is under pressure as a result of intense rate competition.
The London Insurance Market Network (Limnet) already provides a common
framework for communication between brokers and underwriters on the London
market.
The new system was agreed by the London network management committee. It
brings together insurers from the Lloyd's market, the Institute of London
Underwriters, the London Insurance and Reinsurance Market Association and
the London Insurance Brokers' Committee.
The objective is to allow brokers to place electronically policies currently
written on a subscription basis with underwriters.
Such risks are offered to a number of Lloyd's syndicates and companies
outside the Lloyd's market, each of whom subscribe to part of it an agreed
premium rate.
Face-to-face negotiation of terms, conditions and price will remain a
feature of dealing in bigger and more complex risks.

GOVERNMENT moves to tighten the rules on marketing credit were attacked last
night by Mr Bob Wyatt, chairman of the Finance Houses Association, Richard
Waters writes.
Mr Wyatt said at the association's annual dinner in London that debt
difficulties experienced by individuals and companies had not been caused by
irresponsible credit marketing but were the result of the boom-and-bust
cycle in the economy in recent years.
'We see nothing in the credit-marketing proposals that will bring genuine
further protection to the consumer,' he added. 'I hope the authorities will
be responsive to the reasonable suggestions we are making to limit the
damage and cost of these changes.'

AN IMAGE by El Lissitzky, the avant-garde artist who worked in Germany
during the 1920s, sold for Dollars 132,000 (Pounds 73,537) at Christie's in
New York on Tuesday, a record for a photograph at auction. Entitled 'Pelikan
Tinte', it uses photomontage to form an advertisement for an office supply
company. The buyer, who paid twice the high estimate, was a private European
collector.
The auction totalled Dollars 1.49m, with 'Sans Titre', a 'Rayograph' of 1922
by Man Ray, selling for Dollars 104,500. Many lots sold at, or below,
forecast. Three large photogravures by the controversial artist Robert
Mapplethorpe made Dollars 28,600, slightly below their estimate.
Italians dominated the bidding at Sotheby's successful Old Master auction in
London. The auction totalled Pounds 1.7m, with only 11 per cent unsold. A
still life by Cristoforo Munari, the Italian artist, was sold for Pounds
79,200, compared with a top estimate of Pounds 20,000, and a painting of the
'Turin Shroud held by Angels' by Octavanius Montfort, another late
17th-century Italian artist, also far exceeded forecast at Pounds 52,800.

<TEXT>
BLUE ARROW shares worth 4.5 per cent of the company were taken by County
NatWest Securities for genuine market-making purposes, Mr David McMullan,
the former CNWS finance director, told an Old Bailey jury yesterday, John
Mason writes.
Mr McMullan, a prosecution witness, said the size of the holding did not
matter. He had no reason to think that even such a large stake was not for
market-making purposes.
Mr McMullan agreed with Mr Roy Amlot, QC, for Mr Alan Keat, a solicitor with
Travers Smith Braithwaite and one of the defendants, that he took it for
granted that legal advice given before the 1987 rights issue was that
market-makers would be exempt from disclosure obligations if the shares were
bought for the purpose of the business.
County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and
seven individuals deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the result of
the Pounds 837m issue.
The trial continues today.

FT  18 APR 91 / The Guinness Appeals: Allegation against Saunders was
'devastating'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'DEVASTATING' new and highly prejudicial allegation had been made against
Mr Ernest Saunders, the former chairman and chief executive of Guinness, on
Day 75 of the Guinness trial last summer, the Court of Appeal was told
yesterday.
The prosecution had suggested that Mr Saunders had intended for himself
Pounds 3m of a Pounds 5.2m payment he had authorised Guinness to make to Mr
Tom Ward, a US lawyer and Guinness non-executive director, for his services
during the company's Pounds 2.7bn takeover bid for Distillers.
Mr Anthony Shaw, for Mr Saunders, said the allegation, which was denied by
Mr Saunders, had been devastating - as had been demonstrated by the
following day's headlines such as 'Saunders intended to steal Pounds 3m for
his own use'.
The allegation and the way it had been dealt with by the judge were material
irregularities in the trial, Mr Shaw claimed.
Mr Saunders is serving a five-year jail sentence for theft, conspiracy and
false accounting. He, Mr Anthony Parnes, a City stockbroker serving 2 1/2
years, and Mr Gerald Ronson, Heron group chairman, who was freed in February
after serving just under half his 12-month jail sentence, are appealing
against their convictions and sentences, which in Mr Ronson's case included
a Pounds 5m fine.
Mr Shaw said the Pounds 3m had not been mentioned in the indictment or the
statement of the prosecution's case, which had been that the Pounds 5.2m had
been stolen by Mr Saunders for Mr Ward's benefit.
The basis of the new allegation was that the Pounds 3m had passed through Mr
Saunders' Swiss bank account. The prosecution had suggested he had had
second thoughts about keeping it and transferred it to a Swiss account
opened by Mr Ward.
The matter had only been raised during cross-examination of Mr Saunders as
to credit - questioning designed to test his reliability as a witness and
not directed to a specific charge, Mr Shaw said.
The defence had objected that if it was alleged that the Pounds 3m was Mr
Saunders' reward for his part in illegal activities during the bid it should
have been part of the prosecution's primary case against him.
Appalling though the prospect of a retrial had been, the judge had been
asked to discharge the jury because such an allegation at that stage had
been prejudicial and unfair.
Mr Justice Henry had refused to do so but had ruled that the matter could
only affect Mr Saunders' credit.
The hard reality, Mr Shaw said, had been that the jury had been left to
think that here was a man charged with theft who had made Pounds 3m out of
it.
Miss Clare Montgomery, for Mr Parnes, challenged the prosecution's claim,
and the judge's ruling, that under the City code on takeovers and mergers,
Mr Parnes should have disclosed arrangements with which he had been
concerned for payment of indemnities to supporters of Guiness's share price
during the bid.
The appeals continue today.

FT  18 APR 91 / World Trade News: Japanese lack confidence in chip talks
with US
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE officials are publicly confident - but privately cautious - about
prospects for a quick settlement of a new semiconductor pact with the US
government.
A new round of negotiations was to begin here today, but the Japanese
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) said last night that the
delayed arrival of US representatives would mean a resumption delayed until
early next week.
Japanese negotiators are doubtful that the pact will be settled at this
meeting, and say that the US position on several sensitive issues, such as a
target for market share for foreign semiconductor chips in Japan, is
'unreasonable'.
The present five-year pact is to expire at the end of July. US and Japanese
industry officials have wanted the new agreement to be finished well before
then.
The most serious disputes are problems unsettled from the present pact,
including the prickly question of whether Japan agreed that a 20 per cent
foreign share was a target.
US officials insist that 20 per cent was part of the agreement, and want at
least that figure clearly stated in the new agreement.
At the end of last year, the foreign share was reckoned to be 13.2 per cent.
Japanese negotiators say that, if they allow the 20 per cent figure to be
identified, the pact could set a dangerous precedent for managed trade
agreements with the US. Tokyo fears that US frustration in disputed areas -
ranging from cars to computers - could lead to a rush of market share
targets.
'The market share problem will not be settled by the pact negotiators. This
is a political problem and it will need a political solution,' a senior
Japanese trade official said.
Miti officials expect that they will have to include a reference to 20 per
cent somewhere in the new agreement, but they want the final wording unclear
enough to make any claim by Washington to establish the pact as a precedent
for other products difficult to secure.
Although the concept of a target remains disputed, Japanese negotiators say
that the two sides are close to agreement on how to measure the market
share. Until now, two sets of figures have been used - a survey of
chip-makers by the independent World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS)
body and a Miti survey of users.
Since the start of negotiations, the Japanese government has insisted that
Washington drop sanctions imposed under the present agreement. One
negotiator said US officials presume that 'we will drop our opposition to
the 20 per cent figure', if the sanctions are removed.
'We know that they are using these old sanctions as a bargaining chip. It is
quite unreasonable. The sanctions are ridiculous and our concerns about the
20 per cent are very reasonable,' he added.

FT  18 APR 91 / US copes with rail strike, but a day could make the
difference: Industry is holding its breath
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US INDUSTRY was hoping yesterday that Washington would intervene quickly to
halt a national rail strike that threatened to disrupt the economy. The
American Association of Railroads said the stoppage, which began yesterday
morning, was affecting freight traffic across the entire country, with
picketing widespread.
The association said it was not aware of any freight carrier which was
trying to operate, although Amtrak passenger traffic in the north-east
seemed to be flowing normally.
The Illinois Central Railroad said: 'If it drags on, some customers that are
dependent on rail transportation will have some real problems. They won't be
able to get product out of their plants.'
Mr Thomas Hanna, president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association,
said 70 to 80 per cent of motor manufacturing plants would be affected
within 24 hours. All sites could be closed by tomorrow.
Chrysler has warned about 'massive closures' in the industry if the strike
were to drag on, but said yesterday morning it had made no immediate changes
at its plants. It warned, though, that the position 'could change in a day'.
USX, the steel and natural resources group, also suggested that there was
unlikely to be any impact from the first day of the strike. It declined to
say when the halt in railroad traffic might start to bite, but steel
companies generally will probably be affected in a matter of days rather
than weeks.
USX said it had 'done what it could' by stockpiling raw materials before the
stoppage, and by lining up alternative means of transport.
The coal industry is also hoping for a short strike. Most US coal production
is shipped by rail but, with winter over, the seasonal peak has past.
Industries including chemicals, ore, and lumber, as well as second-, third-
and fourth-class mail, also face slowdowns or outright stoppages if the
strike is prolonged.
The US Postal Service said it stopped sending mail via rail last weekend and
planned to use trucks until the strike was settled.
Minneapolis-based Cargill, one of the largest American grain companies, said
it was working closely with customers to manage supplies and was operating
its businesses by using alternative transport, stockpiled materials and
additional storage facilities.
Grain elevators, most of which use railways for shipping, are also being
affected. There was no immediate impact on prices for grains and livestock
on the Chicago futures markets yesterday.
Livestock moves largely by truck and this is not the critical harvest time
in the US grain season. In any case, traders do not believe the government
will allow the strike to continue more than a few days.
Chicago area companies that depend on rail shipments for supplies would be
safe for the moment from the strike, if they have built up stocks. RR
Donnelley, one of the largest US printing and publishing houses, for
example, says that it is using stocks and increasing these by truck.
Trucking companies reported rising business as a result of the strike, but
played down notions of massive additional demand. 'It's been a trickle
effect,' said Arkansas-based JB Hunt. 'It started slowly yesterday, and all
our capacity is now fully utilised.'
Ryder System, another big trucking group, painted a similar picture. 'Huge
would be too strong a word for the upsurge,' it said. 'We have seen quite a
few requests in the past week,' mainly from companies which had 'extremely
time-sensitive requirements'.
In Chicago, the biggest worry was commuter transport. However, some 75,000
Chicago-area commuters were virtually unaffected yesterday morning after a
court order late on Tuesday had required the Chicago and Northwestern
Transportation Company, one of the largest commuter lines, to continue
operations. The case was brought by Metra, the Chicago-area commuter agency
which contracts the railways. The order is to last 10 days.
Railway companies had turned down union offers to keep operating the
commuter lines, saying they would close all operations because of fears of
vandalism and passenger safety.
Mr Jeffrey Ladd, Metra chairman, said C&amp;NW was trying to inconvenience
commuters so as to press Congress into legislating a solution unfavourable
to the unions. He accused the company of a 'lack of corporate citizenship'.
Incoming car traffic to Chicago, was normal. Service on Amtrak between
Chicago and other key mid-western cities such as Milwaukee and Minneapolis
was expected to be disrupted.

MR Roque Fernandez, president of Argentina's central bank, has predicted
that 'as from May, inflation will be zero or close to zero'.
Less optimistic officials say they expect inflation to fall gradually to
about 10 per cent a year. Unofficial forecasts indicate April's rate may
range between 4 per cent and 6 per cent. Prices rose by 11 per cent in
March, less than half February's rate of 27 per cent.
Argentina introduced its toughest adjustment policy yet on April 1, when it
implemented legislation forbidding the central bank from printing money to
cover the government's spending deficit and made the currency convertible.
Mr Fernandez also said the government hoped to reach agreement with the IMF
this month opening the way for a standby loan of about Dollars 1bn.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN to double British exports to Japan during the next three years
was launched yesterday by chairmen and chief executives of some of Britain's
biggest companies.
Companies will be encouraged to establish offices and manufacturing capacity
in Japan. Previous sales campaigns supported by the UK Trade and Industry
Department have concentrated on promoting exports, rather than investment,
in Japan.
The aim is to raise the value of British exports to Pounds 5bn, compared
with Pounds 2.63bn last year, said Mr Michael Perry, vice-chairman of
Unilever and chairman of the Priority Japan campaign. 'An important
objective over the next three years will be to increase market share as well
as the value of exports.'
The campaign - launched yesterday by Mr Perry, Sir David Plastow, chairman
and chief executive of Vickers engineering group, and Sir Paul Girolami,
chairman of Glaxo pharmaceuticals group - is being supported by the DTI and
the British Overseas Trade Board.
Mr Peter Lilley, Trade Secretary, said the government would provide
financial support of Pounds 400,000 during the first year of the campaign.

FT  18 APR 91 / Brazil seeks to boost standing abroad: Country tries to shed
its image as the black sheep of Latin America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Brazilian government is to launch a campaign to improve its
international standing, after last week's agreement with foreign bank
creditors on the payment of arrears.
'We feel we've turned a corner with this accord and can now hope for a new
climate in our international dealings,' said Mr Marcos Azambuja,
director-general of the Brazilian foreign office. 'The impasse with the
banks was like an albatross round our necks. Now it's time we got Brazil
back into fashion'.
As part of this move, Ms Zelia Cardoso, Brazil's finance minister, is
planning trips to Japan, Europe and the US to try to recapture the support
initially given to the government's adjustment plan. President Fernando
Collor plays host to Britain's Prince Charles next week and, in June, will
visit President George Bush.
Before the US visit, Brazil intends to remove the major thorns in trade
relations between the two countries by introducing patent protection and
ending a law which prevents importing of information technology similar to
products manufactured in Brazil.
Brazil is blacklisted by the US commerce department for failing to deal with
these matters and for pirating of US films. The US, Brazil's biggest
creditor, was most instrumental in the recent delay by Group of Seven
countries of a Dollars 350m loan from the Inter-American Development Bank.
This loan is expected to be released soon, following the accord on arrears,
but Brazil is still far from shedding its image in the international
financial community as the black sheep of Latin America.
While many Brazilian officials regard their country as a golden egg which
outsiders are eager to get their hands on, potential investors are
increasingly moving into Mexico, Chile and Venezuela.
Brazil's image has not been helped by what seem ad hoc decisions, such as
the suspension last month of coffee exports, which caused chaos on world
markets, or drastic moves such as the government's seizure of 80 per cent of
domestic assets and savings last year.
Mr Toshiro Kobayashi, director of the Bank of Tokyo, said: 'Brazil is seen
outside as a country one cannot trust. It needs to forget the illusion that
it is a great and rich country, where everything one plants turns to milk
and honey, and torealise that there are other countries where one can make
money without fearing that debts won't be honoured and contracts will be
breached.'
Brazil's next step towards normalising its international relations starts
next Monday, with the arrival of an IMF mission, but continuing economic
instability means an early agreement is unlikely.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Mikhail Gorbachev's attempt to open a new relationship with Japan
and ease political tensions in the Asia-Pacific region appeared to be on the
brink of failure yesterday.
He was politely received in separate magnificent occasions by government,
MPs and business leaders - but nowhere has he made the political or personal
breakthroughs which had been his hallmark in the West in the late 1980s, and
which he hoped to repeat during a four-day visit to Japan.
The issue at the core of the frigid relations between the two countries  -
the Soviet Union's refusal to return the four Kurile Islands seized from
Japan immediately after the war - continues to prevent radical improvements
on any level: political, commercial or diplomatic.
Mr Gorbachev and Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the Japanese premier, met twice
yesterday, the latter session with only one or two aides each and devoted to
the problem of the disputed islands - but without evident agreement. A
further session, billed as the final one, is to be held this morning.
All the indications are that Mr Kaifu has urged a series of compromises on
the Soviet president - notably, that he return to the Soviet position of
1956, under which two of the four islands were offered and the status of the
other two left open. Mr Gorbachev has apparently responded by proposing more
talks on the dispute in the future - but with no hint of leaning towards the
Japanese position. Most speculation in Tokyo last night pointed to a
communique today which recognised the existence of a territorial dispute,
but stated the two countries' different positions.
In a speech to the Japanese Diet yesterday, Mr Gorbachev implicitly
recognised the existence of the territorial issue - something the Soviet
side has previously refused to do. In a passage added to the official text,
he said the outcome of the meetings would be a resolution of the issues the
war had left behind - 'including the most difficult one of all - that of
territorial demarcation'. In the same speech, he talked of 'past mistakes
(which) should be corrected'.
But these were symbolic gestures to a Japanese audience - and fell far short
of the major steps for which Mr Kaifu has asked, and which Mr Gorbachev
would have to deliver for substantial amounts of investment and aid to be
released.
The main substance of Mr Gorbachev's Diet address - a wide-ranging plea for
a new security order in the Pacific, involving a conference of China, India,
Japan, the Soviet Union and the US, together with unilateral Soviet military
reductions to be followed by multilateral cuts - carried little weight with
MPs and was not even put formally to Mr Kaifu by Mr Gorbachev.
A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry said last night that Mr
Gorbachev mentioned only the five-power conference, and otherwise did not
raise the security issue. Asked if Mr Kaifu had received the idea without
enthusiasm, the spokesman said: 'You would not be wrong'.

<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S government was yesterday attacked by local legislators for
running a secretive administration and for failing to disclose details of
its plans to build a HKDollars 100bn (Pounds 7.18bn) international airport,
which has become the subject of a diplomatic confrontation with China.
During a long and tense debate on the project in the colony's Legislative
Council, the government was accused of being 'draconian and irresponsible'
and 'out of touch with people on the streets'.
This marked a significant escalation in domestic terms of the issue, with
the Hong Kong government becoming the butt of public criticism instead of
Peking. The diplomatic confrontation has arisen because China wants to
establish a measure of control over the project and over other issues before
it regains sovereignty in Hong Kong in 1997.
Talks initiated by Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, during a
visit to Peking failed last weekend. The Hong Kong government is now
considering whether to try to reopen talks.
Yesterday's debate was initiated by Mr Martin Lee, leader of the colony's
main pro-democracy party, who arrives in London today to urge British
politicians to stop Hong Kong giving way to China's demands for a measure of
control.

<TEXT>
IRAQ is asking the UN Security Council to relax the ban on the sale of its
oil so that Baghdad may obtain a total of Dollars 942.5m (Pounds 526.5m) to
buy food and to meet 'basic humanitarian needs'.
UN officials said last night they expect the Council's sanctions committee
to meet tomorrow to consider the request. Easing the ban would require the
assent of all 15 committee members.
The responses of the US, Britain and France will be guided by Iraqi action
following a decision of the three powers to set up secure camps in northern
Iraq in an expanded relief programme for Kurdish refugees fleeing brutal
repression by Iraqi troops.
Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari, the Iraqi delegate, discussed the situation
yesterday with Mr Thomas Pickering, the US representative. He told reporters
later: 'We believe there is no need for foreign forces to protect the Kurds
because they are really protected by our own people.'
Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the UN secretary-general, who discussed the
Kurdish crisis in Paris with French officials, again emphasised a need to
respect Iraqi sovereignty. If refugee camps were to be maintained under UN
auspices the entire operation must be approved by the Iraqi government and
the Security Council, he said.
The western permanent members' attitude towards Baghdad's request to resume
oil shipments is expected to be influenced also by how far Iraq goes towards
complying with the Security Council's order for the destruction of its
chemical, biological and ballistic weapons and nuclear weapon-usable
material.
Under the Council's terms for a permanent ceasefire, which Iraq accepted
unconditionally last Friday, details of the amounts and locations must be
given today to the secretary-general. The International Atomic Energy Agency
in Vienna has to be informed by the same deadline about any nuclear weapons
material that Iraq possesses.
An international commission is to be set up to supervise the destruction of
all of Iraq's most dangerous weapons.

THE German government yesterday agreed a sharp increase in aid for Kurdish
refugees in the area around northern Iraq, with a total of DM440m (Pounds
146m) now earmarked for a humanitarian operation given all-party support in
Bonn.
Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the foreign minister, said German hospitals would
offer beds for victims of Baghdad's aggression against the Kurdish people.
Mr Genscher, who will fly to eastern Anatolia tomorrow to inspect the relief
operations, said the lives of 'hundreds of thousands' were at stake.
In an unusual display of harmony, the German Bundestag unanimously condemned
Iraq's persecution of the Kurdish people as 'attempted genocide'. A motion
proposed by the government and opposition supported the use of military
force in the region if necessary to dissuade the Baghdad regime from further
action against the Kurds.
Yesterday's increase in aid to the refugees, agreed at the weekly cabinet
meeting, came as the German army sent more helicopters to eastern Turkey for
use in supply missions for the displaced population. A total of 20
Bundeswehr helicopters are planned to be in use there later this week.
The German government funds will be used to finance help organised by the
German Red Cross and other international charity operations. It will also go
towards the rescue efforts mounted by the German army.

FT  18 APR 91 / Kurds foresee a long-term need for protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION to send US, British and French troops to establish and defend
Kurdish refugee camps in northern Iraq raises the question of how long the
Kurds will need protection from their own government.
The answer, according to Kurdish refugees and exiles, is that the United
Nations or the western powers will have to safeguard Iraq's 4m Kurds at
least until President Saddam Hussein is overthrown and possibly longer.
Kurdish groups yesterday welcomed President Bush's announcement on the
deployment of troops to protect Kurdish zones in northern Iraq, but they
emphasised that the move responded to urgent humanitarian needs without
providing a political solution to the Kurdish problem.
Most Iraqi Kurds, including the main opposition groups fighting the Iraqi
government, have officially rejected separatism and are demanding autonomy
within a united and democratic Iraq.
Few of them, remembering the killings of recent days, the gassing of Kurds
at Halabja in 1988 and the destruction of 4,000 Kurdish villages on
President Saddam's orders, will ever be persuaded to accept at face value Mr
Saddam's periodic offers of amnesty to Kurdish refugees.
Kurds say that even if President Saddam is removed, Arab nationalist and
anti-Kurdish sentiments fostered by the Iraqi authorities may cause further
misery for the Kurdish people.
'We don't want to be reduced to a refugee population in a number of camps,'
said Dr Kamal Mirawdeli, director of the Kurdish Information and Educational
Project in London.
'But even if the Shia come to power, or another government - a pro-Saudi
government - there is no guarantee that they won't behave in the same way ..
The only guarantee is for there to be a federal state and for the UN to
recognise that.'
Kurds facing long stays in bleak refugee camps are acutely aware of the
mistakes made by their Palestinian fellow-refugees. They fear they may live
to regret leaving their homes in the face of real or threatened persecution,
and moderate Kurds are anxious to restrain those who advocate terrorism.
'If we're going to have a permanent refugee problem then obviously it's
going to be worse, a lot worse than expected,' said Mr Abbas Vali, senior
politics lecturer at the University of Wales at Swansea. 'It's going to be a
breeding ground for all sorts of negative tendencies in the Kurdish
movement.'
The Kurds have few qualms about seeking military help from the outside
world. They argue that the world has obligations under the Genocide
Convention of 1948. They point out that foreign intervention to help peoples
subjected to tyranny is not unprecedented, and cite the US invasion of
Panama in 1989 and the Tanzanian overthrow of Uganda's Idi Amin ten years
earlier.
Kurdish guerrilla groups resent the suggestion that they miscalculated by
launching an ill-advised rebellion throughout Iraqi Kurdistan after the
allies defeated President Saddam's army and drove it out of Kuwait.
What in fact occurred was a spontaneous popular uprising that the guerrillas
could not ignore. At first they had only 10,000 fighters under arms, but
their ranks were swelled by mass defections from the government's Kurdish
militia.
All were lightly armed, and could not hope to hold the towns when confronted
with Iraqi tanks, artillery and helicopter gunships. They were defeated in
Kirkuk but elsewhere they simply melted into the hills to continue the
fight.
Civilians in towns, meanwhile, took fright as the government again seized
control and took its revenge; in the old days they would have taken refuge
in their mountain villages, but President Saddam had destroyed them.
If the Iraqi Kurds are ever to leave the refugee camps, which have yet to be
built to receive them, and if the international community is ever to be
relieved of the responsibility of protecting them, the Kurds will have to
become part of Iraq's political system.
'If the allied forces, the west, are looking for a stable Iraq - which is
really their primary objective rather than democracy - they must take into
consideration the fact that there can be no stability in Iraq if 4m to 5m
Kurds are excluded,' Mr Vali says.

LUXEMBOURG'S proposals on political union risk turning the Commission into a
mere 'secretariat to the other (EC) institutions', Mr Jacques Delors,
president of the European Commission, warned yesterday.
At the same time, members of the European Parliament expressed fears that
they would be given only a limited new role in the legislative process under
the plans tabled by Luxembourg, which holds the European Community
presidency, on Monday.
The two attacks on the proposals revealed the deep-seated concerns of the
two EC institutions about where democratic decision-making power will lie in
a united Europe.
The draft treaty on political union drawn up by Luxembourg proposes
increasing the powers of the parliament by giving it the right of
'co-decision' with the Council of EC governments on certain legislation.
At the moment the parliament's legislative role is principally advisory. It
is the Commission in Brussels which initiates laws, and later attempts to
broker compromises between member states and between the council and the
parliament, which can propose amendments to legislation.
The Commission is worried that it will be squeezed out of the legislative
process altogether under the new proposals.
'How can one explain the willingness on the part of certain of the
Community's founder members to weaken one of the institutions of the Treaty
(of Rome) - the Commission?' asked Mr Delors, in yesterday's debate on the
progress of the inter-governmental conference (IGC) on political union.
MEPs concede that the Luxembourg proposals are superficially attractive for
them, but they are worried because the draft limits the right to co-decision
to a new category of EC act called 'laws'. These EC laws would deal with
'fundamental principles and general rules', undefined in the Luxembourg
paper.
Mr David Martin, British Labour MEP for Lothians and a member of the
parliament's committee on institutional affairs, said after the debate: 'The
draft treaty is better than we anticipated but that's only because our level
of expectation was pretty low. It's far short of what parliament would
accept in terms of treaty reform.'
Mr Jacques Poos, Luxembourg's foreign minister, apparently believes that the
draft proposals would win the support of nine of the 12 member states.
Although he has not named the dissenters they are thought to be the UK,
Denmark, and either Ireland or Portugal.

BRITAIN'S Carroll Group yesterday became the first western company to obtain
a long-term lease on Soviet land when it finalised an agreement to build a
Pounds 150m trade centre in Moscow.
It has created a joint venture with Moscow city council's Association of
Hotels for the project. The British-Soviet Trade Centre is due to open on a
5-acre site in 1994.
The 99-year lease is the closest thing to foreign land ownership allowed
under new legislation in the Russian Federation, the country's largest
republic, which has tried to press ahead with radical economic reform. But
the legislation has stopped short of allowing outright ownership by
foreigners, partly because of fears that it would allow them to swallow up
land at bargain prices.
The centre will include 20,000 square metres of office accommodation as well
as 500 hotel rooms. To facilitate approval of the deal, Carroll has also
agreed to build a kindergarten for the local district, as well as homes for
150 families.

DEMONSTRATIONS against unemployment in east Germany appear to be giving way
to apathy and resignation. Only 35,000 people turned up for a rally in
Berlin yesterday compared with the 100,000 expected by the organisers.
On Monday night only about 5,000 people demonstrated in Leipzig, where
weekly rallies earlier this year attracted tens of thousands protesting
against the collapse of industry.
East Germans are expressing increasing scepticism about whether they can
change the economic situation by demonstrating, an attitude bred by 40 years
of enforced passivity under the Communists.
Addressing yesterday's demonstration, Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of the IG
Metall union, hit back at conservative politicians who had accused him of
creating a climate of confrontation which enabled terrorists to assassinate
Mr Detlev Rohwedder, president of the Treuhand privatisation agency, on
April 1. His critics have also condemned him for organising the weekly
protest demonstrations in Leipzig against unemployment.
Mr Steinkuhler said it was 'abominable' to use Mr Rohwedder's murder to
equate peaceful demonstrations with violence. He demanded an end to
'willy-nilly' privatisation by the Treuhand which he said was demotivating
workers.
IG Metall is hoping to win an extension of the one-year no-sackings
agreement it negotiated last year for the east German metal industry. The
agreement runs out on July 1 but the union is to hold talks with employers
on April 26. Many employers have been waiting for it to run out before
announcing big redundancies.

This double retreat has spurred fresh speculation that Prime Minister Michel
Rocard could be in danger of being dropped by President Francois Mitterrand.
Speculation has surfaced repeatedly since Mr Rocard was first appointed
three years ago. He and the president are known to have an uneasy personal
relationship, and Mr Mitterrand is widely believed to be alert to any
opportunity of dumping him.
Until now, however, Mr Rocard has successfully guided his government through
the difficulties of assembling shifting majorities in parliament, and he
continues to enjoy high popularity in opinion polls.
The government's reluctance to press ahead with the two reform bills may
suggest that its political fortunes are taking a turn for the worse,
however.
The bill withdrawn from parliamentary consideration was a plan to reform
voting rules in regional elections next year. The purpose was blatant
gerrymandering, being designed to disadvantage the conservative opposition
parties.
The voting method being proposed would have embarrassed the moderate
conservatives by confronting them with an uncomfortable choice between an
open alliance with the extreme right-wing National Front and an open
rejection of such an alliance.
The irony is that the bill could probably have found a majority, if it had
not been for some fine print required by Mr Mitterrand against Mr Rocard's
wishes.
The second bill, which has been postponed, would have reformed the savings
banks and turned them into a large-scale retail banking network.
The government has retreated there because the opposition was using the bill
as an opportunity to mount an attack against the associated, state-owned
Caisse des Depots et Consignations (CDC).

(7): Aiming to be a stepping stone off Europe - The differences between two
Channel Islands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JERSEY, SAYS Mr Colin Powell, the island's economic adviser and top civil
servant, is aiming to be 'a stepping stone off Europe for people worldwide
to use'.
Already a substantial and comparatively sophisticated financial centre, but
one geared in primarily to the UK and to British expatriates around the
world, Jersey is hoping to broaden its appeal, so as to become 'offshore
Europe' rather than 'offshore UK'.
Perched just off the coast of Normandy the island is certainly
well-positioned, and already plays host to a good range of international
financial institutions. But perhaps it needs to improve its linguistic
skills and become more accommodating to Continental practices before it can
fully assume a multinational role.
Jersey's financial industry has been growing strongly for many years,
although there is now a hint of a slowdown, as a reflection of the
international economic recession.
Bank deposits of Pounds 44.4bn at the end of 1990 (in some 60 licensed
banking institutions) showed a rise of Pounds 4bn in the year, a
satisfactory figure, though indicating a deceleration compared with the much
more buoyant conditions of the late 1980s.
Investment funds had a tough year, especially in the second half. From
Pounds 6.7bn at the end of June the total assets of funds registered in the
island dropped to Pounds 5.3bn in September, reflecting poor stock market
conditions as well as a stagnation in the number of funds.
In the final quarter the total value edged up to Pounds 5.6bn, however, and
clearly will have surged forward in recent months in line with buoyant share
prices worldwide.
It is in this offshore funds sector that Jersey has felt competition from
the two 'onshore/offshore' European Community centres in Luxembourg and
Dublin. A few fund management groups have shifted funds to those locations,
hoping to find it easier to market their investment products on the
Continent. However, most of the fund groups have found their Luxembourg
'umbrella' funds to be disappointingly slow sellers.
Jersey funds, in contrast, can only be sold through normal retail channels
in EC member states by means of bilateral agreements. Only one such
agreement has been concluded with the UK, and about 25 funds out of 170-odd
can be sold on the UK mainland.
An important business in Jersey, as in its rival Channel Island of Guernsey,
is the management of offshore trusts. However, this received a sharp (though
long expected) setback in the UK Budget on March 19 when UK taxes were
slapped on new trusts set up by UK residents.
However, the Jersey view is that the damage will be small. 'The loss of that
business is marginal in its impact,' claims Mr Powell. 'The majority of
trust management firms have non-UK oriented trust business anyway.'
In fact, the government of Jersey has been forced into something of a
reconsideration of the island's future development as an offshore centre in
the light of the progress of the European Community towards a Single Market.
At one stage the island's isolation from the EC - it has links, but is a
non-member for most purposes - was viewed with a degree of anxiety. More
recently, though, the potential of the 'Offshore Europe' role has been seen
to be considerable.
A comparatively well-developed legal and regulatory framework offers
considerable advantages compared with, say, the upstart centres of the
Mediterranean. At the same time, the limited physical capacity of the
island, with a population of some 86,000, which it is determined to
restrain, has caused concern.
It is hard for new financial institutions to enter Jersey, although the
government is anxious to deny suggestions that it is full up. The zero job
growth policy is designed to reduce employment growth to nil by 1992, and
yet Mr Powell insists that flexibility will be applied, and it is still
possible for new companies to enter if they bring additional connections and
skills to the island.
Public relations advisers have been hired to create a more positive
marketing formula, and Jersey will soon publish a Strategic Policy Report
setting out five-year objectives. But no great departures are expected:
relationships with the UK and the Continent are already regarded as
satisfactory, and as providing the basis for future growth.
The 'offshore Europe' role could get a boost soon from a deal with Japan
allowing Jersey funds to be sold to retail investors in Japan. Already a
large volume of Japanese institutional investment money enters Europe
through Jersey, where it is cushioned from the hazards of mainland taxation.
If Luxembourg and Dublin should ever lose their tax privileges, and succumb
to the pressures for EC-wide investment income withholding taxes, the
Channel Islands would be waiting to pick up large volumes of displaced
financial business.

(9): Cyprus woos more Gulf investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 600 offshore companies and firms have offices in Cyprus, by no
means all of them in the financial services sector.
Those that arrive there find a banking system modelled on that of the UK and
well-experienced in handling trade finance and investment.
Exchange controls are light for foreign companies, though Cyprus residents
are not allowed to hold foreign currency. Non-residents can hold Cyprus
pounds and foreign currency accounts with authorised banks. There are no
controls over the transfer of funds to these accounts. Equity capital for
foreign investors must come from abroad and the terms of foreign loans have
to be approved by the Central Bank. Capital invested and gains from the
disposal of shares can be freely remitted abroad. There is no ceiling on
profit remittances or minimum period for disposing of investments.
Moves to encourage offshore financial investments for the eastern
Mediterranean and the Gulf have been under way for some years. To date,15
offshore banking units have been established, entitled to tax, customers'
and other benefits.
One advantage enjoyed by Cyprus is the time zone with a 'window' which fits
neatly between the closing time of financial centres in east Asia and the
opening time of those in the western hemisphere.

(8): Ahead in insurance - Guernsey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LITTLE smaller than its neighbour Jersey, the other main Channel Island of
Guernsey (population 60,000) has successfully cultivated an equally
respectable image as a well-regulated UK offshore centre, and is now also
seeking to develop its business with the Continent of Europe.
It has the same territorial status as Jersey - it is a British Crown
possession rather than a part of the UK, and is for most practical purposes
 -certainly in respect of financial services - outside the European
Community.
But inevitably there is confusion about the two islands in the minds of many
foreigners, and the debate in Guernsey is whether it should seek to
differentiate itself from Jersey in some way, perhaps through a marketing
campaign.
The Guernsey authorities have been pondering the merits of a recent report
prepared by the London advertising and public relations agency Streets. For
example, should the leaders of Guernsey's financial community set out on a
series of Continental road shows?
A recent slackening of the momentum of financial business expansion may be
concentrating minds. The influx of new 'managed' banks in the past 18 months
has stopped for the moment, probably because in the face of the global
recession banks around the world have shelved their expansion plans. Still,
with 72 resident banking institutions Guernsey boasted bank deposits of
Pounds 14.9bn at the end of 1990, up nearly Pounds 2bn on the year.
As for investment funds, after a noticeably quiet winter, when the Gulf war
choked off business, the rise in global stock markets appears to be
producing a revival of activity. Some five new A class collective investment
schemes are in the pipeline (A schemes are eligible for recognition by the
Securities and Investments Board in the UK). At the end of December 1990
there were 156 authorised open-ended, 50 in class A and 106 in the
offshore-only B class.
These open-ended funds had assets of Pounds 3.07bn in aggregate last
December, and there were also some 55 closed-ended schemes worth an
additional Pounds 1.3bn-plus.
One area in which Guernsey is distinct from Jersey is in offshore insurance.
With some 190 captive insurance companies Guernsey is the European time zone
market leader, albeit a long way behind Bermuda.
However, Guernsey is under competitive pressure in captive insurance
business at the moment from Dublin and the Isle of Man, and may need to
respond by improving the incentives for new captives to set up in the
island.
In offshore life business, Guernsey hopes to follow Jersey by enacting
offshore personal pensions legislation, probably later this year, though
there have been disappointing delays. Guernsey plans will be capable of
origination by local life companies: lacking insurance companies of its own,
Jersey relies on plans marketed by mainland life companies through Jersey
intermediaries.
The offshore trust sector was braced for a blow in the UK Budget in March
and it duly fell. But Mr John Roper, director-general of the Financial
Services Commission (FSC), tries to make the best of a bad job. He argues
that existing trusts are unlikely to be repatriated to the UK, even if new
business stops coming.
In any case, Guernsey's strategy is anyway to reduce the links with the UK.
'This is a blessing in disguise because it will stimulate our industry to
find new sources of business,' he argues. Like his Jersey counterparts, Mr
Roper is expecting a breakthrough after several years of negotiations with
the Japanese Ministry of Finance over the eligibility of Channel Island
investment funds for retail marketing in Japan. This could attract business
which at present goes mostly through Luxembourg.
Over several years, largely to cope with the consequences of the UK's
Financial Services Act 1986, Guernsey has built up a substantial regulatory
body in the FSC, staffed at senior levels mainly by ex-Bank of England
officials.
A point of debate now is whether the FSC should actually take part in the
promotion of Guernsey's offshore finance industry, perhaps by funding all or
part of a marketing exercise.
But there are potential conflicts. Not only is it doubtful whether
regulators should get mixed up in promotion, but the cost would presumably
have to be met out of the fees charged to existing financial institutions.
The latter might be happy to see this done to attract new business to the
island, but less pleased if the emphasis were on bringing in new
institutions which would increase competition for those already established.
Still, Guernsey needs to address some of these issues if it is to make a
serious impact in the European market place.

(6): Haven for tax-free gains - Luxembourg / The Grand Duchy has
traditionally appealed to French, Belgian, Dutch and German investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS AN offshore financial centre, Luxembourg has developed two important
lines of business - private banking and Ucits, (Undertaking for Collective
Investments in Transferable Securities).
Luxembourg's bankers shudder if you refer to Switzerland in the same breath
as the Grand Duchy itself. However, though members of Luxembourg's financial
community dislike the suggestion that Luxembourg is a 'down-market'
alternative to Switzerland, there is no denying the fact that Swiss banks
have long appealed to a wealthier class of investor - whether a Middle
Eastern sheikh or an Asian dictator.
Luxembourg has traditionally appealed to continental investors who wanted to
keep their investments offshore and for whom Luxembourg's financial district
was only a short train or car ride away.
These investors tend to use the centre as a safe home for deposits and
bearer bonds where their gains can accrue tax-free. Many are attracted by
the fact that Luxembourg does not have a withholding tax on profits, unlike
some of the rival offshore centres.
Although drug-dealing and fraud are regarded as criminal activities in
Luxembourg, tax evasion is not. Like the Swiss banks, those in Luxembourg do
not see why they should act as policemen for the tax authorities, and this
has undoubtedly contributed to its appeal for many years.
Luxembourg originally developed as a centre specialising in currency
investment: many of the investors from neighbouring countries are familiar
with investing in a range of currencies and want advice on currency
diversification: they want to know which particular currencies are offering
the highest interest rates while keeping their exchange rate risk to a
minimum.
However, in recent years, many of the banks in Luxembourg have been
expanding in the wider field of asset management. For the wealthy investor
this may mean private portfolio management, but for those with less than
about Dollars 300,000 it usually means investing in pooled funds which in
turn invest in real estate, bonds or equities, whether in Europe, the US or
one of the emerging East Asian economies.
The fact that Luxembourg is a member of the EC, unlike Switzerland, means
that some doubt hangs over its future as a tax-evasion centre. The main fear
is that Luxembourg could be forced to share information about investors from
other EC countries with the relevant tax authorities. However, even if
Luxembourg's attraction in this field is diminished, it has already carved
out a position as the centre for Ucits.
These are pooled, open-ended investments (similar to unit trusts) which
allow small investors to invest in a range of shares or bonds. They can be
marketed across the EC - in other words, a German or UK group is free to
sell its products to French investors. Many of the large fund management
groups, including such names as Fidelity, have set up their administrative
offices in Luxembourg with the result that there are now several hundred
funds based in the Grand Duchy.
Luxembourg took the opportunity early on to attract fund management groups
to market their funds in the EC from the Grand Duchy as it provides a
centrally located base.
Furthermore, with its favourable tax environment - no withholding tax on
distributions and no income tax on the fund - it has proved a relatively
cheap place from which to set up Ucits, even though in many cases the actual
fund management is carried out in more sophisticated financial centres such
as London or Tokyo.

(4): Nervous newcomer - Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRELAND is the nervous newcomer among offshore financial centres. In 1987
the government came out strongly in favour of the idea of an International
Financial Services Centre (IFSC), to be based on the banks of the River
Liffey in central Dublin.
In return for tax concessions and other incentives, companies were invited
to base their treasury functions in Ireland, in the process creating
thousands of much-needed jobs. The government successfully convinced the EC
Commission that Ireland suffered because of its geographical isolation in
Europe and needed special favours to counter this 'peripherality'. The IFSC,
costing more than IPounds 450m Dollars 703m), is now opening for business
and the time of truth has come.
So far the outlook is good. A carefully co-ordinated marketing exercise has
persuaded about 150 companies to set up operations in the IFSC. Of these, 90
are already open for business, employing more than 700 people.
The Irish economy has traditionally been dominated by the agricultural
sector, but in the decades following the Second World War governments sought
to develop an industrial base to combat rising unemployment levels. Generous
tax concessions were offered to foreign manufacturers willing to invest in
Ireland. The direct precedent for the IFSC was established in 1958, when new
legislation granted 25-year tax exemptions to some trading operations based
round Shannon airport in the south-west of the country. In 1981, a 10 per
cent corporation tax covering the manufacturing sector was extended to
service related activities. By the mid-80s it had been decided that Dublin
could emulate the successful Shannon Free Zone - home now to a number of
financial service companies though more famous for its leading role in the
worldwide aircraft leasing business. A derelict docks site close to Dublin
city centre was earmarked for a large renewal project.
The project's centrepiece would be the IFSC, a cluster of office blocks
where international financial services companies could operate under a
special tax regime. Apart from the 10 per cent corporation tax rate, the
government offered incentives including a 10-year exemption from rates,
double deduction of rent expenses for companies holding leases of 10 years
or more, and write-offs of up to 100 per cent of new building costs for the
first year.
Until last year the EC had restricted the concessionary tax rate period to
2000, and the end of 1990 had been set as the deadline for the approval of
new projects. Following a meeting between Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish
minister for finance, and Sir Leon Brittan, vice-president of the EC
Commission, the tax concession period was extended until 2005 and new
projects could be approved up to the end of 1994.
While the EC Commission has shown itself to be well disposed to the growth
of the IFSC, some European tax authorities are discreetly letting it be
known that they will not tolerate firms moving operations to Dublin merely
as a means of tax avoidance. The Irish government has highlighted its
exclusion of 'brass plate' companies from the site. 'We don't want to
promote it as a tax haven,' says Mr Reynolds.
Only genuine companies are being admitted - ones which employ identifiable
staff and hold out the prospect of indirect contributions to the Irish
economy through using local banking and professional services.
Generating employment remains one of the government's primary aims, and it
has predicted that eventually up to 7,000 jobs may be provided by the
Centre. The Industrial Development Authority, the state body which promotes
inward investment, wants 5,000 jobs created at the centre by 1993.
As well as the tax concessions offered at the IFSC, its promoters also
highlight Ireland's EC membership, proximity to London and low rents
compared with other centres - though there have been complaints that there
is a need for more supervision of the letting process. Much emphasis has
been placed on the ready availability in Ireland of well-educated,
English-speaking young people. While the employment 'shake-out' in London
and elsewhere has eradicated any labour shortages in the sector, the Irish
have built up considerable financial services skills.
Against these attractions is the unusually high rate of personal tax in
Ireland, where a single man can pay taxes of almost 50 per cent on earnings
of less than IPounds 15,000 per year. The government is making efforts to
reduce personal and indirect tax rates, but the burden of interest payments
on an IPounds 25bn national debt has made any substantial progress
difficult.
Domestic institutions have tended to lead the way in establishing a presence
in the IFSC. Allied Irish, the country's biggest clearing bank, took the
lead by purchasing the first office block to house its treasury activities.
Bank of Ireland has purchased its own block and several big companies -
Daiwa Securities, Chase Manhattan, Citicorp and Swiss Bank Corp - have added
their names to the tenant list.
Activities which qualify for the IFSC's incentives package include dealings
in foreign currencies, general asset management, Undertaking for Collective
Investments in Transferable Securities (ucits), plus related activities such
as insurance, accounting and the development of computer software to meet
the specialist demands of the sector. Those responsible for marketing the
IFSC have had to adjust some of their more ambitious targets as the
recession has begun to take its toll. But the IFSC is very much open for
business.

(2): Confirmation of Swiss superiority - Zurich bankers have been reassured
by the Gulf crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DULLFORCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GULF crisis has brought Swiss bankers a reassuring confirmation of
Switzerland's superiority in attracting offshore capital.
A year ago the bankers were worried about a slowdown in the growth of monies
seeking management in Switzerland. Among the many reasons cited were the
depreciation of the Swiss franc, the impression among foreign clients that
Swiss bank secrecy was being eroded and, perhaps most important, tougher
competition from other financial centres which had relaxed capital controls.
Offshore Switzerland was losing its comparative advantages, it was said.
After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last August funds flooded into Swiss
banks from the Middle East. Arab bankers estimate that in a couple of weeks
between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 15bn bolted from the Gulf to safer havens,
the bulk finding its way into Switzerland.
Most went into short-term, money market placements in dollars, not into the
managed portfolios of diversified assets which are the classic instruments
of Swiss private bankers. But, at a time when Swiss banking is really in a
period of transition and is having to change old habits, the knowledge that
Switzerland was still the haven to which the wealthy turned in a crisis has
been an important psychological stimulant.
It was all the more important because Swiss bankers have been stressed over
the past two years. Not only have they experienced sharper competition from
other financial centres, they have also been obliged to adjust to new
legislation against money laundering and have had to face the dismantling of
long-standing cartel arrangements, which had previously underpinned their
profits.
In addition, an element of uncertainty has been injected by the movement
towards a single market for financial services within the European
Community. EC action postulates the possibility that the Swiss will need to
bring their practices, particularly in tax matters, into conformity but,
until the 12 EC member-states agree among themselves, the Swiss can only
speculate about the direction in which they may be pushed.
Nevertheless, in spite of the doubts that had been raised, Swiss primacy in
managing the assets of the rich has yet to be seriously challenged. If an
offshore centre is defined as a market for non-domestic money, then
Switzerland continues to dominate the offshore business.
By virtue of the confidentiality of the business no reliable statistics
exist. Among more recent estimates one from a real insider, Pictet &amp; Cie,
the biggest Swiss private bank, put the total of clients' assets under
management in Swiss banks at roughly SFr1,800bn (Dollars 1,250bn). A
Citibank study suggested that the Swiss controlled about half the
international market for non-domestic money management; more modestly, Mr
Jean Bonna, partner in Lombard, Odier, the second largest Swiss private
bank, had earlier estimated the Swiss share at 40 per cent.
Swiss private banking tradition dates back more than two centuries but the
mass of funds under management have accumulated over the past four decades.
Switzerland's attraction has been a combination of bank secrecy, political
and economic stability, a firm currency, strongly capitalised banks and
conservative asset management. Some of these advantages have begun to appear
less secure in recent years.
Most of the assets under management still belong to rich individuals but the
proportion owned by institutions, such as pension funds, has grown fast.
Competition for the institutional business has become sharp; it has
compelled the banks to invest heavily in computerised systems and has
affected attitudes towards the private customers.
There has been a burgeoning of bank-managed funds, many of them domiciled
outside Switzerland to avoid Swiss withholding tax. Clients whose assets are
not large enough to warrant the construction and management of a personal
portfolio are advised to use the funds. The limit varies, some banks
suggesting that they need at least SFr2m to construct a portfolio, while
independent portfolio managers mention SFr1m or even less. But the private
bankers insist that the personal relationship with their clients remains
their crucial and studiously cultivated advantage.
Pictet put the value of clients' assets under management in the private
banks at SFr110bn at the end of 1989. By far the larger part of the
estimated total, SFr1,800bn, managed in Switzerland is with the three big
banks, Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Suisse.
At the other end of the scale are several hundred independent investment
counsellors or boutiques, advising clients on the placement of monies on
deposit with the banks; the counsellors receive a management fee and the
banks earn commissions on the transactions.
A little insight into the volume of business done by these independent
counsellors was given recently when the private bankers started to lift a
corner of the secrecy surrounding their operations. Lombard, Odier, for
instance, reported that some 6 per cent of the SFr30bn-SFr35bn in assets it
controlled were managed by independent professionals.
Moreover, Lombard, Odier revealed that a surprising 45 per cent of the
assets belonged to institutional investors and that it runs 43 funds
designed to cover the widely varying needs of its private clients.
Two recent developments have, or are about to, influence the Swiss banks'
relationship with their foreign clients. One is the abandoning under
pressure from the Cartel Commission and the government of the convention
fixing brokerage fees. The other is the announcement expected soon from the
Federal Banking Commission banning the so-called formula B.
Formula B is the document which authorises Swiss lawyers or fiduciary agents
to place clients' monies with Swiss banks without divulging the identities
of their clients. The Banking Commission considers this method of preserving
the anonymity of customers is incompatible with the new law against money
laundering which requires the banks to know the beneficial owner of monies
placed with them.
The dismantling of the convention setting brokerage commissions has already
led some Swiss banks to start emphasising management fees rather than
continuing to rely, as in the past, on their brokerage income. Banks'
reactions have varied, there has so far been no sign of severe price-cutting
by banks seeking to win market shares and it is still not clear to what
extent investors can benefit from shopping around to find the bank offering
the lowest charges.
An important signpost remains hidden over the hump of the EC's internal
deliberations about its single market. It indicates the direction the
Community will finally take in exchanging information about taxation between
member states.
If Brussels plumps for a thorough-going system of tax controls, some bankers
foresee a flood of money from EC countries moving into Switzerland, which
could, in turn, prompt strong pressure from the Community for the Swiss to
abandon their long-standing refusal to co-operate in tracking tax evaders.

THE Isle of Man finance industry is very buoyant and, with plenty of space
available for expansion, the island expects considerable growth in that
sector over the next few years. The strict regulatory framework, built over
the past eight years, is regarded by Manx-based institutions as helpful
rather than onerous.
The industry and the Manx government are monitoring developments of the
single European market, but more with a view to spotting potential for
business rather than through fear of loss of business.
The Isle of Man, which has its own parliament, is not a full member of the
EC, but as a crown dependency of the UK has a special relationship with it.
It can export certain products, not financial, into the EC but is not
eligible for grant aid.
Most island-based institutions have felt no need to be situated inside the
EC boundaries. However, Clerical Medical and Target International have
opened Luxembourg offices in addition to their bank space to comply with EC
regulations that required fund administration to be in situ. Barclays
Unicorn moved its operation from the island to consolidate all its offshore
work in Luxembourg.
The island's financial industry and its attitude to business have changed
considerably in the past decade. In the seventies and early eighties naivety
and an urgent need for economic expansion left the island open to the ploys
of dubious entrepreneurs and practitioners.
But the much-publicised Pounds 42m crash of the Savings and Investment Bank
in 1982 deeply scarred the island. It forced upon its legislators the
realisation that there is much more to operating a finance sector than
rudimentary checks.
Since the Financial Supervision Commission was instituted in 1983 it has
doggedly pursued and addressed areas within the finance industry that left
the island open to abuse. The commission is on the side of the investor, but
has remained sensitive to legitimate needs of the industry and production of
legislation always involves lengthy consultation with members of the
industry.
Mr Jim Noakes, director of the Finance Supervision Commission, said: 'If we
can establish the broad area of common interest between regulator and
regulated in safeguarding the customer, it's easier to isolate the cowboys.'
The banking sector continues to grow with two new institutions licensed in
the past 12 months, bringing the total up to 60 including the building
societies. Last year the commission announced it was opening the doors for
managed banks, but sought only those with sound, internationally reputable
parents. So far three have been set up.
Private banking is on the increase and in line with other jurisdiction most
island-based banks have set up trust administration arms, using their
international branch networks to build the client base. Barclays, Lloyds,
Midland, NatWest, Bank of Scotland and others offer specialised trust
administration.
Insurance forms a large part of the Manx finance industry and big life
assurance companies, such as Eagle Star, Royal Life and Safe Assurance of
the Danish Trygg group, have centred their offshore businesses there.
The growth of captive insurance companies in the Isle of Man reflects the
solid base of expertise available in this field. Last year the island
secured 30 per cent of captives formed worldwide and to date 102 captives
have been formed. These include such leading companies as Jaguar, British
Gas and Midland Electricity Board.
Investor protection is high on the priorities with legislation for deposit
and investor protection schemes passed this year. The schemes mirror those
in the UK, with deposit protection of maximum 75 per cent of the first
Pounds 20,000 covered and investor protection of maximum Pounds 48,000.
Trust and company formation and administration constitute a large proportion
of the finance sector but many professionals see this area as the weak link
in the chain of respectability and would like to see more control.
The three classes of company available are resident, tax-exempt and
non-resident. Tax-exempt are managed from the island but carry on business
elsewhere and are limited to certain types of business. Non-resident are
managed and do business elsewhere and the degree of anonymity this allows
leaves their use open to abuse.
So far the authorities have refused to eliminate the non-resident company as
an entity, in spite of this having been achieved in the Channel Islands.
Licensing of trust and company administration is being discussed as an
option. Mr Mark Solly, a partner in the accountancy firm Moore Stephens and
a former director of the Financial Supervision Commission, feels this may
prove difficult. He says the key to cleaning up the act is to insist on
accountability within the company by ensuring all companies have at least
one Manx director.
'I believe there are too many difficulties to introduce a licensing system
to make people responsible for companies they formed, and over which they
subsequently have no control,' he said.
While banks and reputable firms forming and administering trusts and
companies carry out rigorous checks on potential clients, unfortunately
there are still some practitioners who do not. Consequently the Manx fraud
squad has more than a full-time job dealing with inquiries from law
enforcement agencies abroad. The majority of these involve a Manx
non-resident company.
But the authorities recognise this gap in the legislation and Mr Noakes says
it is now their No 1 priority. Serious consultation on the issue is under
way between the authorities and members of the industry.

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investment Offshore Centres
(3): Political problems thwart ambitions - Gibraltar / While officials,
bankers and lawyers make an excellent case for the Rock as an international
finance centre, Madriddoes its best to enforce isolation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

<TEXT>
GIBRALTAR'S economic ambitions to become a significant player in the
offshore banking business are indisputable. Just as apparent are the
problems, which have nothing to do with finance, the British Crown Colony
faces in its bid to achieve this ambition.
The current situation, which has everything to do with politics, amounts to
a cruel paradox derived from the fact that Gibraltar is not geographically
offshore at all but linked by a narrow isthmus to Spain. This would not
necessarily matter were it not for the fact that Madrid claims sovereignty
over the Rock and therefore does everything within its power to deny it a
viable independent future.
The paradox is that while Gibraltar's officials and its banking and legal
community make an excellent case for the Rock as an international finance
centre, Madrid does its best to enforce isolation on the colony.
Telecommunications with Spain are appalling, Spanish custom officials ensure
interminable queues at the colony's frontier post with the mainland and
Madrid's diplomatic manoeuvring in the EC has effectively reduced
Gibraltar's regular air links with the outside world to trips to the United
Kingdom.
Such pressure has by no means prevented Gibraltar's success in building up
its economic muscle and its purposeful entry into the offshore business.
Gibraltar had four banks at start of the 1980s, 11 midway through that
decade and now has 30, 10 of which have offshore banking divisions. Total
bank assets stood at around Pounds 1bn three years ago and have now risen to
more than Pounds 2.5bn. Some 9,000 companies were registered on the Rock
four years ago and there are now more than 42,000.
According to the Gibraltar government's calculations the Rock now has 2 per
cent of the global offshore sector and the idea is to double this market
quota in the near future. An international consultancy, hired by the
Gibraltar government, is conducting an overall review of the policies
required to place the Rock solidly on the offshore map.
The offshore niche that the Rock has in its sights is emphatically located
in Europe. Gibraltar sees itself as a tax efficient base for business in the
EC.
'The Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the Isle of Man, Jersey and the rest share
with us a relationship with the UK and have been in the offshore business
longer and more successfully than us,' says Mr Joe Bassano, Gibraltar's
chief minister. 'But none of them is a member of the EC like we are and that
is the special advantage we can offer.'
To the extreme irritation of the Spanish government which views the Rock
either as a British colony or as an integral part of Spain but never an
independent state, Mr Bassano likes to say that Gibraltar is 'de facto the
13th member of the Community'.
Exempted, by its membership terms, from the EC's fiscal system, Gibraltar
has a special jurisdiction, comparable to Luxembourg's and Dublin's, that
affords specific offshore possibilities.
Mr Michael Davidson, who runs Barclays Bank on the Rock, views Gibraltar's
peculiar EC status as its main selling point: 'We are one of the three
offshore centres within Europe and we are able therefore to sell fund
management products throughout the Community.' Bankers in Jersey and
Guernsey, in contrast, have to seek approval from the authorities in each
member state before they can trade such products.
There are additional pluses for the colony. 'There is more confidentiality
in general banking services in Gibraltar than on the Isle of Man,' says Mr
Jose Navarro, who runs the offshore banking divisions on the Rock for
Spain's premier bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. 'We can offer here the same as
Jersey but we can make it far more tailor-made.'
Gibraltar sells itself as better equipped to deal with the EC and also as
more receptive to the medium net worth individual. 'In Jersey I was solely
interested in people with Pounds 20m,' says one banker who moved from the
Channel Islands to the Rock. 'Here, if someone arrives with Pounds 1m, the
red carpet is rolled out.'
The attention that a Gibraltar-based bank will devote to its individual
client is mirrored by the goodwill that the institution itself receives from
a local government that is avidly encouraging the growth of the financial
sector. 'If a bank is going to create five jobs in Gibraltar then it is very
important to us,' says chief minister Bassano. 'A small investment elsewhere
represents a big one here.'
The review of Gibraltar's future as an offshore centre will focus on the
Rock's opportunities to offer fiscal breaks. 'It would be unrealistic to
believe that the EC will achieve total tax harmonisation,' says Mr William
Penman Brown, a former Guernsey banker who was recently appointed the
colony's Financial Services Commissioner. 'There will be little pockets like
Luxembourg and ourselves who will able to give (tax) advantages.'
It is unfortunate in this respect that the Spanish government should be
seeking to close off precisely the fiscal loopholes afforded by offshore
centres such as the Rock.
Draft legislation that aims to tax non-resident property owners in Spain
will hurt Gibraltar far more than other offshore centres because as Mr
Penman Brown puts it 'Gibraltar has so many eggs in the Spanish basket'. A
high proportion of the Rock-based companies created in recent years were
formed by wealthy foreigners seeking to avoid the Spanish taxman when buying
their Costa homes.
In the meantime, Spanish hostility to Gibraltar's offshore pretensions
effectively precludes the establishment on the Rock of meaningful corporate
business. According to Mr J E Triay, one of the Rock's most respected and
veteran lawyers, 'the influence of Spain is too great; Gibraltar cannot
become an offshore centre if Spain does not want it to.'
Put quite bluntly the long-term future of the Rock as a solid offshore
centre requires a radical change in its present political status in order to
accommodate Madrid. Ideally, Gibraltar should be to Spain what the Channel
Islands are to the UK. But Gibraltarians, virtually unanimously, reject such
a future.

FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investment Offshore Centres
(1): Prospering at the fringe - There is plenty of competition among
Europe's smaller states to act as a magnet for tax and regulatory-shy
clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL can be beautiful in the world of finance. Wherever there are
differential rates of tax, and different approaches to regulation,
businesses will flock to those areas with the lowest tax and the most
flexible regulatory regimes. And there is plenty of competition among
Europe's smaller states to act as the magnet for tax and regulatory-shy
businessmen.
The term 'offshore financial centre' in fact covers a multitude of sins and
a wide variety of areas and regulatory regimes.
Many places which have the characteristics of offshore centres, such as
Switzerland and Liechtenstein, are in the heart of the continent. Most, if
they are offshore of anything, are merely outside the regulatory confines of
the European Community.
The existence of these centres creates a knotty problem for the EC. It wants
to integrate financial services in the single market, without driving
business into areas outside the community.
The internationalisation of business, which the EC has helped to foster, has
created the conditions for the offshore centres to flourish. Expatriate
workers have good tax reasons for seeking havens which are outside their
countries of origin and the states where they work. Yet the Community is
hardly going to benefit from a single market, if the main result is for tax
revenues to drain offshore.
The position of Luxembourg is another difficulty for the Brussels
bureaucrats. Euromarket folklore speaks of the typical retail investor - the
'Belgian dentist' - depositing his bearer Eurobonds in Luxembourg to avoid
tax.
Whether or not the folklore has much basis in reality, Luxembourg has built
up a vigorous financial services sector by becoming the EC's 'on-site'
offshore centre.
In principle, the creation of a true single market in financial services
should eliminate Luxembourg's advantages, as tax and regulations would be
the same across the Community. In practice, however, the reforms made so far
have reinforced Luxembourg's position.
The removal of restrictions on capital flows simply makes it easier for
wealthy citizens to transfer their funds to an offshore centre. And
differential rates of reform have also helped the smaller states.
A prime example is the directive on Ucits (Undertakings for Collective
investment in Transferable Securities). Designed as a means of encouraging a
Europe-wide market in open-ended investment, it has sent fund mangement
companies flocking to establish in Luxembourg which was one of the quickest
countries to implement the directive.
Fidelity, for example, chose to use Luxembourg as the administrative base
for its range of Ucits funds, which it sees as the base of its worldwide
marketing efforts for the 1990s.
Perhaps the EC is subconsciously happy to see Luxembourg challenge
Switzerland as the haven for the world's wealthy. The main effect of the
mooted uniform EC withholding tax might simply be to drive business from
Luxembourg to Switzerland or even further afield.
The Swiss have been faced with a series of challenges over the past few
years as the US, in particular, has laid siege to the much-heralded
tradition of Swiss banking secrecy.
The ramifications of the single European market may yet affect Swiss
financial services business (although the impact could be positive) and the
Swiss are facing competition from a host of other areas such as Gibraltar,
Malta and Madeira. The impact of each individual centre might be small but
the collective challenge is great.
For those aiming to flourish as offshore financial centres, the attractions
are obvious. Financial services business brings revenues to the area,
without the environmental side effects caused by other industries. Even a
nominal tax charge on a large financial services sector can bring in
substantial revenues to a small state.
Ireland which has a high domestic tax regime has attempted to attract
international business by creating a low tax financial centre in Dublin. The
centre has attracted 150 businesses and created 700 much-needed jobs.
For those centres trying to attract international capital, there are three
main dangers.
Those attracted to offshore centres are often trying to avoid or evade taxes
and the clientele could easily include drug and other criminal barons.
Some centres have tried to respond to international fears; Luxembourg has
agreed that it will not apply its banking secrecy laws where there is
evidence of criminal activity; the Channel Islands have imposed
drug-trafficking laws on the lines of those in force in the UK.
There is also the risk that a centre grabs so much business that it attracts
the wrath of a more powerful neighbour. The Channel Islands have urged their
financial companies not to market too heavily in the UK, for example, for
fear of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.
Another danger is that the wrong type of financial services group is
attracted to the centre, and the inevitable scandal can then ruin the area's
reputation. The Isle of Man and Gibraltar are both trying to live down the
effects of 1980s financial group collapses.
Offshore centres are unlikely ever to be able to shed their slightly
unsavoury air. After all, avoiding tax is always going to be one of the
primary reasons for heading for an offshore centre; and confidentiality,
another main attraction of such centres, is usually valued because the
taxman is excluded from the confidences.
According to the UK tax lawyer, Mr Philip Newhouse of Taylor Joynson
Garrett, cheapness is not an advantage of an offshore centre since 'if you
want to set up a company cheaply, the UK's the place'.
visionary to imagine that regulators can make offshore centres disappear.
If European authorities find a way of cracking down on their offshore
centres, money will simply flow to havens off other continents. European
offshore centres will continue to flourish for the foreseeable future.

FT  17 APR 91 / Survey of Telford &amp; Shropshire (7): Sweet taste of success -
Muller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION of a new yoghurt production plant for Molkerei Alois Muller of
Aretsreid, Bavaria, has started at Market Drayton - a move which has brought
some smiles to Shropshire County Council, which is celebrating the largest
inward investment that its economic development department has managed to
attract.
Muller's total investment will be Pounds 20m. It has signed contracts to
take 22 acres of land at the Tern Valley Business Park, a venture of the
County Council, the North Shropshire District Council and the Rural
Development Commission.
The decision by Muller to go to Market Drayton followed 15 months of
negotiations with the county council which had originally responded to an
advertisement for a site placed by Muller in the Financial Times.
The first request was for five acres of land, but this demand gradually
increased. The planning permission for the site covers 12 acres.
By any standards, Muller's move is a fillip to the local economy.
Recruitment starts later this year and production will start in summer 1992
with a payroll of about 100. But employment is expected to grow over four
years to 500. This would make Muller the biggest employer in Market Drayton,
replacing Palethorpe, the sausage manufacturer.
Such investments are seen as necessary to bring more competition to the
local labour market so that the level of wages may gradually be raised and
the lagging rural economy reinvigorated with greater spending power. The
investment, in any case, helps to counterbalance the problems faced by local
food processing industry.
The attraction of Market Drayton for Muller were largely twofold.
First, the town is near the motorway network, important for the distribution
of goods with a limited shelf life. Second, the town is within an hour's
tanker drive of 25 per cent of UK dairy production.
Muller will be buying about 50m litres of milk a year to produce initially
about 300m pots of yoghurt a year spread over a range of 15 products. This
is an important degree of import substitution: Muller is estimated to have a
13 per cent share of the UK yoghurt market, but all of this is produced at
the Aretsreid plant.
The Market Drayton plant, the first overseas venture for Muller, a private
company, will provide yoghurt not only for the UK market but also for
Belgium, northern France, Netherlands and Scandinavia. The Aretsreid plant
will service Muller's other European markets.

FT  17 APR 91 / Survey of Telford &amp; Shropshire (8): Farmers feel the strain
 -Paul Cheeseright assesses the county's agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHROPSHIRE farmers, like their counterparts throughout the UK, are feeling
the strain. Markets for their products are increasingly clogged. The level
of subsidies is declining as the European Community seeks to bring its
agricultural support under tighter control and prepare for a dismantling of
farm subsidies under any agreement which may be reached with the
international trading community within the framework of the GATT talks.
What sets Shropshire aside from other counties is the diversity of its
agriculture. Unlike, say, arable Lincolnshire, it is genuinely mixed. On the
plain, in the north and north-west of the county, there is emphasis on dairy
farming. The eastern side is largely arable, but in the hill country of the
south and south-west beef and sheep farming predominates. Holdings tend to
be smaller where the ground is higher, along the Welsh border, and larger
further to the east. For the most part they have shared in increasing
mechanisation and higher productivity.
But within this general and geographical pattern, changes are taking place
under the influence of the external pressures which are gradually changing
the shape of the industry. Because the tight economic policies followed by
the UK government coincide with the particular farming problem that more is
produced than the markets can absorb, and because many farmers are
over-capitalised, financial pressures are forcing a drift off the land. In
many cases, income is the same in money terms, and hence less in real terms,
than it was four years ago.
'There is growing unease,' says the county council, 'amongst the rural
community that the continuing reduction in farm income and investment in the
rural activities is causing major difficulties. As yet, little exists in
statistical terms ng.'
Certainly there are manifestations of difficulty. One is the effect on the
local food processing industry, which has seen farm co-operatives in
difficulties and the closure of of the J. P. Wood plant at Craven Arms and
the Dairy Crest plant at Ellesmere. Such closures are only partly offset by
the decision of, for example, Muller of Germany, to establish a yogurt plant
at Market Drayton. The overall problem is that cash drains out of the rural
economy and affects the fabric of support businesses, such as retail, farm
machinery and transport.
The declining rural economy has led to diminished competition for labour and
this has had a significant effect in making Shropshire wage rates among the
lowest in the UK. In turn this creates social problems, not least the
concern about the availability of affordable housing in rural areas.
At the same time, financial strains in the industry hasten changes in the
shape of farming. There is a trend towards the consolidation of farming
units. This has been happening for some years, but now, in the dairy sector,
some four per cent of producers are leaving the industry each year. And the
process is likely to speed up. 'The trend towards having less farmers will
be intensified over the next year or two unless there is major change in EC
or national support,' says Mr Bill Hall, regional business management
adviser at the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service.
Further, the problems of the industry and, indeed, their mixture with the
more general national process of decentralisation from the conurbations,
have led to volatility of land prices. The market for farm land has been
distorted by the desirability or otherwise of the residence which happens to
be on it and by the ability to sell milk quotas.
Depending on the area of the county, land prices vary from Pounds 1,200 to
Pounds 3,000 an acre. A milk quota is worth roughly Pounds 0.35 a litre, so
that at the top of the market land with a milk quota may reach Pounds 4,000
an acre. But, Mr Hall comments, 'there is quite a lot of land not finding
buyers at the asking price.'
The desire of the affluent in urban areas to move into the countryside is in
some cases changing the pattern of land ownership in rural Shropshire. The
process has not gone as far as it has in the Thames Valley or the Cotswolds,
but there is, for example, a growing number of Wolverhampton businessmen
among farm owners. On one hand, the opening of the M54 motorway into
Shropshire has opened up the possibility of commuting to Birmingham and the
Black Country towns, while on the other parts of the county are within reach
of the North Wales corridor.
All of this points to a rural economy in the process of change. The problems
of the sector have led to a greater concentration on diversification and
this is advocated with increasing urgency by the ministry of agriculture,
the Agricultural Development Advisory Service and the local authorities.
Such diversification is taking the form of providing facilities for tourism,
the development of specialised products - cheeses, ice cream and so on - and
a certain expansion of organic farming. The horticultural sector is not
well-developed, although is a long-established business based on direct
selling to the public in the areas adjacent to Wolverhampton and around
Shrewsbury.
But the desire to widen the scope of the rural economy by attracting new
forms of commercial activity that sit easily with the acknowledged charm of
the Shropshire countryside has been hindered by the lack of serviced land
outside the immediate area of Telford. This is not an area of activity in
which the private property development sector has shown much interest. Hence
the decision of the County Council to go ahead and provide such sites with
its own funds near, for example, Shrewsbury, Market Drayton and Bishops
Castle.
'Once serviced land is in place, the private sector will come', officials
said confidently. But that, presumably, will be after the recession.

FT  17 APR 91 / Survey of Telford &amp; Shropshire (9): Twin attractions of
rural idyll and industrial heritage - Efforts to encourage tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE other parts of the old industrial north of England, Telford and
Shropshire have realised that tourism is big business and that they have a
number of assets which can be turned to good account to attract visitors.
Telford itself could hardly be described as a tourist attraction. It is a
modern town, which in its present form has been built by the Development
Corporation. But some of the scenes of dereliction have been transformed by
imaginative landscaping and other improvements, so visitors staying in
business hotels such as the Holiday Inn or the Moat House will not find
Telford unappealing.
As well as the modern shopping area with sports grounds and an ice rink in
the new centre, there are 450 acres of open countryside in the middle of the
town. There is a miniature steam railway and lakeside amphitheatre, the
award winning Chelsea garden and the Maxell Japanese Cherry garden.
What Telford may lack in historical perspective is more than made good by
nearby Ironbridge. The industrial revolution was born at nearby
Coalbrookdale, where in 1709 the Quaker ironmaster Abraham Darby discovered
the secret of smelting iron ore using coke, which was cheap and plentiful,
instead of the more expensive charcoal - a discovery which opened the way to
large-scale industrial production of iron.
The presence of coal, iron ore and limestone turned east Shropshire into the
centre of Britain's iron trade. It was at Coalbrookdale the first iron rails
were made for railways, together with the first iron cylinders for steam
engines and, of course, the world's first iron bridge in the appropriately
named village of Ironbridge.
Other industries sprang up alongside iron and coal, particularly pottery and
porcelain at Coalport, before the region began to decline in the mid-19th
century.
The industrial past is commemorated by the Ironbridge Gorge Museum which has
seven sites spread over six square miles of stunning scenery. These include
Blists Hill, which is a reconstruction of a Victorian working community. At
Coalbrookdale, the Great Warehouse contains the story of ironmaking, while
the Rosehill House shows how the Darby family lived.
Mr Richard Bifield, tourism officer at Wrekin District Council, estimates
that in 1989 the area (Wrekin covers greater Telford and the towns around
Ironbridge) had 800,000 visitors, compared with 250,000 ten years ago. These
visitors spent around Pounds 20m, and more than half of that was spent by
leisure tourists.
The reason that the district council started to take tourism seriously,
however, was that it provided jobs in an area of traditionally high
unemployment. Although still a small employer compared to other more
established areas, tourism now accounts for 1,400 jobs, or just under 2 per
cent of the work force. Ten years ago the sector employed only 170 people.
Like Bradford with its photography museum, Burton with its beer museum and
Liverpool with the Albert Dock complex, Telford has used its industrial past
to establish revenue producing assets, giving it a foothold in an important,
growing industry.
Of course, there is more to Shropshire than Telford. The county is largely
rural, with rolling hills and vales, quiet, picturesque villages and
hamlets, medieval castles, ancient churches and grand country houses.
Shrewsbury is perhaps England's finest remaining Tudor town, while Ludlow
has its Norman castle. There are other 'products' (as such sites are known
in the tourism business) dotted around the county, including the renowned
Severn Valley Steam Railway and the new Childhood and Costume Museum, both
at Bridgnorth; the Midland Motor Museum at Weston Park; and the aerospace
museum at Cosford. Charles Darwin, of theory of evolution fame, and Robert
Clive - Clive of India - both sprang from Shropshire and their respective
birth places are well noted.
Although final figures have not yet been established, there were probably
more than 1.5m visitors to Shropshire and its attractions in 1990, and they
spent a total of Pounds 49m.
Shropshire has the beginnings of modest tourism industry, which probably
accounts for over 5,000 jobs or around 5-6 per cent of the workforce. The
county and district authorities have been examining whether more could be
done to encourage extra business.
Together with the English Tourist Board and the Heart of England Tourist
Board (which covers six counties in the middle of England), the county
council and the six district councils have been engaged in a Tourism
Development Action Plan.
The TDAP, which cost Pounds 300,000 and is now coming to an end after three
years, looked at ways of improving standards, at signposting and raising
awareness of the county's heritage, at setting up information centres and in
training and business advice.
It also examined ways in which tourism might move forward. Two main areas
were identified: more could be done to develop and widen business tourism
and, in the leisure field, more overseas staying visitors could be
attracted.
Only around 7-8 per cent of visitors to Telford and Wrekin are from
overseas. Unlike Chester, York or Stratford-upon-Avon, Shropshire is not on
the 'circuit' for visiting Americans. Yet evidence of a rich past is as
abundantly evident in Shrewsbury as it is in Chester. A strong promotion in
the US might enable the county to tap this potential vein of business.
In business tourism, while Telford gets many visitors for strictly business
purposes, the idea should be get them to bring their wives and children and
stay for weekends. Telford should also try and develop gatherings such as
board meetings and conferences. It has the hotels, but should try and
broaden their use.
While occupancy rates in other main hotels are down to around 50 per cent in
the current tourism climate, they were running at over 70 per cent a year
ago. With the Gulf war over and people beginning to travel again, there is
no reason why Telford and Shropshire should not gain a larger share of niche
markets.

FT  17 APR 91 / Survey of Telford &amp; Shropshire (6): New premium on training
 -Trends point to changing patterns of employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
INVESTMENT drawn to Telford has been by far the most important factor in the
employment growth of Shropshire. For the medium term, at least, this trend
is likely to continue. But the shape of the labour force is changing in a
way which puts a premium on training.
At the time of the last census in 1987, when the population of the county
was about 400,000, the number of jobs in the county was nearly 130,000,
roughly 10,000 more than in 1980. But a breakdown of jobs, by district
council area, showed that at best there had been a marginal increase and in
some cases a small decline in job numbers in the Bridgnorth, North
Shropshire, Oswestry, Shrewsbury and Atcham, and South Shropshire areas.
Only in the Wrekin district, which contains Telford, was there a marked
increase.
Work carried out by Prism Research for a county labour market assessment
commissioned by the new Shropshire Training and Enterprise Council (TEC)
points out that between 1984 and 1990, 'Telford alone accounted for 95 per
cent of all new jobs. These trends are expected to continue to 1993 with
8,000 new jobs forecast throughout the county; 1,000 through natural growth
and 7,000 through the Telford effect.'
Projections of the County Council suggest that that between 1989 and the
year 2006, the labour force could increase in size by between 22,500 and
40,000. The minimum figure is derived from forecast natural change and
migration. The maximum figure could be reached if there is a high level of
economic activity.
Two points emerge from these separate forecasts. First, if employment growth
is to be more evenly spread over the county in the next decades, land supply
for new commercial activity will have to be greater outside the Wrekin and
Oswestry areas. The decline in the rural economy will have to be halted by
welding new sources of employment on to farming and its associated
industries.
Second, although absolute numbers of jobs and people to fill them may
increase, the constituent parts of the labour force will gradually change,
thus demanding a change in the recruitment policy of companies in the
county. Prism Research has highlighted three features: a 16 per cent decline
in the number of school leavers, to 5,000, between 1989-93; a decline in the
number of those aged between 16 and 44 years; and increase in those older
than 45.
Against this background, the expected labour needs include not only
operatives for manufacturing industry but those with managerial,
professional and technical skills to underpin the growth of manufacturing
industry and those with clerical and secretarial skills to support it. The
services sector has already started to expand in the Telford area and
Shrewsbury traditionally has been a strong commercial centre with an
influence stretching into Wales.
Prism Research concludes that 'employers will need to consider alternative
labour sources such as women returners to meet recruitment needs' and,
because Shropshire traditionally has not had a strong demand for managers,
professionals and clerical staff, there is a growing necessity for 'more
employers to train and develop existing staff.'
Obviously, however, entrants to the labour force will be a minority. The
Shropshire TEC notes that, 'As 80 per cent of the employees of the year 2000
are currently in employment, employers already hold the key to most of their
future labour needs. The competitiveness of individual businesses can be
greatly enhanced through an appropriately trained and skilled workforce.'
The responsibility for providing the framework in which this process of
skill enhancement, of matching skills to needs, of fostering commercial
acumen, now falls on the Shropshire TEC, which formally started operations
on April 2 1991.
The timing was less than encouraging. The onus of effort will fall on
companies currently coping with recession, historically the part of the
economic cycle when there is a tendency to cut spending on investment and
training. At the same time, the UK government is reducing spending on youth
and employment training; indeed, there is an abundance of local complaints
that, proportionately, Shropshire's spending is being reduced by a greater
amount than the average national fall.
Certainly, in budgetary terms, the Shropshire TEC is one of the smallest of
82 around the UK, with an overall budget for the financial year 1991-92 of
about Pounds 12m. Most of that will be spent on youth and employment
training, picking up the mantle of the Training Agency.
Mr Roy Knott, the chief executive, says that in the face of reduced
government spending, the TEC is 'spreading the pain evenly' among the
companies and institutions which provide training. The biggest of these is
Shropshire County Council, which forecasts expenditure on training in 1991-2
of Pounds 5.56m and income from it of Pounds 5.53m. Its training contract
with the TEC this year will be smaller than its contract with the Training
Agency last year.
The scale of the operation is indicated by the fact that in early January,
there were 2,402 people engaged in youth training throughout Shropshire,
while a further 4,700 were taking part in various adult training schemes,
including employment training.
Out of its overall budget, Shropshire TEC has some Pounds 2m to spend on
local initiatives and on enterprise support, largely the administration of
the enterprise allowance. Support for small business is crucial to the
growth of the county economy: 90 per cent of businesses employ less than 25
people and the self-employed sector has grown by 20 per cent since 1981. The
growth has been most marked in the Telford area and least marked in the
south of the county.
It is a significant comment on the county economy that while the TEC is
seeking to devolve its encouragement of training and enterprise down to six
area boards, mirroring the district councils, it has also set up a special
committee of private and public sector leaders to do the same thing
exclusively for agriculture.

FT  17 APR 91 / Survey of Telford &amp; Shropshire (5): Private sector set to
benefit from legacy of development - The TDC is being wound up. Stewart
Dalby analyses its record
</HEADLINE>

NEW TOWN corporations are wound up, or 'realised', when the secretary of
state for the environment feels that the town has reached critical mass;
that is, enough infrastructure has been built and sufficient housing,
factories, offices and leisure facilities constructed for the town to be
self-sustaining. In theory, there should be no need for vast sums of new
public money to be spent.
What will have been achieved when Telford Development Corporation is wound
up in September? Roads, utilities and major public services will all be in
place. There is a wide range of leisure facilities, including an ice rink,
indoor tennis centre, three purpose-built sports centres, three swimming
pools, four golf courses within a three mile (5km) radius and a multi-screen
cinema.
The town is connected to the main link rail link to London's King's Cross.
It adjacent to the M54 motorway and there are anumber of good hotels.
More than 1.4m sq m of factory floorspace had been constructed by last year
and more than 142,182 sq m of office accommodation put up. In addition,
there is 187,924 sq m of retail floorspace.
Around 45,053 houses will have been built during the lifetime of the
corporation, some 14,668 of them by the public sector. For all intents and
purposes this means the development corporation. Since 1968, the development
corporation reckons it has built 11,700 houses.
During the lifetime of the corporation, the population has grown from 74,000
to 120,000 and, on the basis of what has been built, Telford seems a
well-rounded town where people can live, work, play and shop.
Where does it go from here, in terms of the availability and cost of shops,
offices, houses and land?
Telford's new town corporation has divested itself of most of its assets
before realisation. A recent example is the sale of the entire town centre
shopping complex, an area of 750,000 sq ft, to Universities Superannuation
Scheme (USS), for Pounds 100m.
Many of the houses that the development corporation built for rent have been
sold off to tenants under the government's right-to-buy scheme. Indeed, the
development corporation reckons it has been more successful than any public
body under the right-to-buy scheme. Of the 11,700 houses built for rent,
only 4,000 remain in tenants' hands. The local Wrekin District Council would
like to take them over because of the rents. But the decision is up to the
tenants themselves, who will be balloted on whether they want to be taken
over by the council or local housing associations or whether they want to
buy.
Almost all of the factories built by the corporation or constructed on its
land have been sold. Mr Chris MacKrell, the current commercial director at
the TDC who will become executive officer for the Commission for New Towns
in September, estimates that at wind-up, the TDC will have between 500,000
sq ft and 750,000 sq ft of built factory space to dispose of, along with
some 2,000 acres of land, most of it serviced.
The exact amount of factory space is not known because the corporation is
negotiating with the local council over the transfer of community related
assets. These include, for example, some 1,000 acres of parkland. The
corporation cannot simply transfer those assets without the means to
maintain them. This usually involves setting up endowments. The endowments,
in turn, are usually funded by income from other corporation assets such as
factories and offices.
The most likely outcome is that the amount of industrial space the
corporation will have to dispose of will be at the bottom end of its
estimates, that is around 500,000 sq ft. Considering that more than 15m sq
ft of factory space was built on corporation-owned land, this is not a great
deal left to sell off.
The recession has hit Telford like many other places. But Mr MacKrell is
sanguine that the outstanding industrial properties will move once the
climate improves. He also believes there will be demand for the land. It is
reasonably priced. At something like Pounds 140,000 an acre before the
recession, it was very competitive with land in the West Midlands. The
population of Telford is predicted to rise to 128,000 by 1995. Interest from
overseas companies continues to be strong (there are more than 115 in
Telford). Factory space is predicted to rise from the current 1.4m sq m to
1.8m sq mby 1995.
The corporation does not have any commercial property availability of
privately developed commercial premises - particularly B1 properties in
Telford, both in the enterprise zone and elsewhere.
Moreover, although the market is sluggish, developments are going ahead. The
Thoroughbred Property group is offering its flagship Pegasus Court
development, which is 73,000 sq ft in its first phase. This is a mixed
development of commercial, light industrial and warehousing in the
enterprise zone.
Most of the 270 acres of the enterprise zone have now been developed,
although there is a little land left. The advantage of the EZ is that no
rates are payable until 1994.
The Thoroughbred group is also developing Landau Court, on the edge of
Wellington town centre. Mountleigh Northern Developments, in association
with the Brighouse Group, is proceeding with an office development on the
Stafford Court Business Park, a 73,000 sq ft scheme with the 36,000 sq ft
headquarters building, Hollinswood House, as its centrepiece.
Rents in Telford range from Pounds 8.50 to Pounds 15 per sq ft. An average
is Pounds 11.50 per sq ft, even in the enterprise zone. In all, it is
thought that some 250,000 sq ft of office accommodation, both in and out of
the enterprise zone, either is or will be available.
The recession has had its effects on retail property. But when a property
became available in the town centre complex recently it went for Pounds 110
per sq ft for zone A, which suggests prices are holding up. This shopping
centre is now almost fully let, with retailers such as Marks and Spencers,
Debenhams, C&amp;A and Boots.
House building has slowed down in the past year, although it has been
predicted that Telford will need a further 5,000 homes by 1995. The local
district council estimates that there will be a need for more rented
accommodation.
Prices are notional at the moment, but for a new town, Telford has a
surprisingly wide range of houses on offer. They start at Pounds 40,000 for
a two bedroom semi-detached house, rising to Pounds 170,000 for an
'executive-style' home.

FT  17 APR 91 / Survey of Telford &amp; Shropshire (3): New transport links
planned - Paul Cheeseright assesses moves to improve communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHROPSHIRE is not in the fast lane. The M54 which links the county into the
national motorway network, peters out at Telford and turns into the A5.
British Rail Inter City electrified services from London stop near the
county border at Wolverhampton and passengers become subject, for the
journey to Telford and Shrewsbury, to diesel locomotives.
Change is at hand, however. Over the next decade, Shropshire should become
more firmly embedded into the national transport system.
In economic terms, arguably the biggest boost will come from the extension
of the M54 motorway to Shrewsbury. Work started in July 1990 and should be
completed by summer 1992. The extension is taking place in two sections: the
eastern section will cost Pounds 38.6m, the western section, Pounds 25.8m.
Experience elsewhere in the UK has shown that the completion of a motorway
adds economic vigour to the surrounding areas. The M4 from London to Swansea
is a case in point. In the cases of the M11, between London and Cambridge,
and the M40 extension, between Oxford and Birmingham, planners have sought
to channel development into specifically designated areas.
Given the largely rural nature of Shropshire, with its few urban growth
points, a similar policy is likely to be adopted.
Locally, some pressure has been brought to bear on British Rail to electrify
the line between Wolverhampton and Shrewsbury, thus speeding communications
to the south east.
But British Rail has not made its mind up. It does acknowledge that the
diesel locomotives currently in use are aged and unreliable and that a
decision on their replacement will have to be made soon.
Electrification is just one of three choices and carries the financial
caveat that, under British Rail's present funding arrangements, any
electrification investment must return eight per cent on capital employed.
The other choices before British Rail are to put on to the line high speed
diesel locomotives of the sort used on the North Wales coast line or to have
brand new diesel passenger trains which would be attached to the existing
Inner City service and then detached at Wolverhampton.
Any decision will be made against the background of complex business
calculations on likely traffic flows and within the terms of British Rail's
business organisation: most of the rail traffic in Shropshire is regional
traffic and Inter City services, in effect, buy from the regional services a
share in the track.
Over the longer term, most significant communications developments will
largely be outside the county but will, nonetheless, have the effect of
improving links to the rest of the UK.
The only motorway exit from the county at the moment is through the M54
which joins the M6 north of the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation. The M6
then provides direct access to the north west and, through its junction with
other motorways, to the south east, the rest of the Midlands and the south
west.
But there are plans to build around the conurbation a northern relief road
and and a western orbital road. Plans is perhaps too strong a word. In fact,
both projects are being out out to private tender. Both have to define in
detail their routes. Both have to run the gamut of the planning process.
Although the Department of Transport is clinging to a schedule of completion
within five or six years, historical experience suggests this is optimistic.
Should the roads be built, however, access from Shropshire to the south west
through the western orbital road and indeed to the south east through the
more easily reached M42 and the M40, and to the north through the northern
relief road, will be made much simpler. And simpler still if yet another
private sector road, from Birmingham to Manchester, is ever built.

FT  17 APR 91 / Survey of Telford &amp; Shropshire (4): Pounds 65m plant to
create 450 jobs - Japanese-led scheme is Telford's biggest overseas
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPONDENSO has started to recruit staff for the biggest single overseas
investment project in Telford - a Pounds 65m plant to manufacture automotive
heating and air-conditioning units. When full production is reached in 1995,
450 jobs will have been created.
The project is a joint venture between Nippondenso, the Japanese group which
has worldwide annual sales of more than Pounds 5bn, and Magneti Marelli,
which is two-thirds owned by Fiat, the Italian group. But Nippondenso, which
holds 75 per cent of the equity in the joint venture, is managing the
project.
At the beginning of 1992, Nippondenso will start recruiting staff in two
categories: maintenance and general plant workers like assemblers and
machine operators.
Mr Michio Ohiwa, Nippondenso's man in charge at Telford, is following what
has become an established line of Japanese recruitment policy in the UK. 'We
want people who are diligent and have a positive attitude to the job and can
keep good teamwork', he says.
In terms of Telford's economic development, the main impact of the
Nippondenso project, initially at least, is purely that of job creation. It
is doubtful whether the project will deepen the economy, though it will
extend it.
The technology to be used at the plant is solely that of Nippondenso.
There are no plans for a design or technological centre. The plant is a
simple manufacturing facility.
To this extent, the venture is clearly a 'screwdriver assembly' operation of
the type with which Japanese industry has become associated in, for example,
south Wales. But in Telford, it is pointed out that assembly tends to be the
first phase of corporate involvement in the local economy; design centres,
the brains of an operation, can come later.
Certainly there are no local qualms about the presence of Nippondenso.
Mr Ohiwa notes that there are many good places for manufacturing, but he has
been impressed by the support organisation - the Telford Development
Corporation - of the area.
An additional sweetener was the availability of Pounds 2.2m in regional aid.
This is a greenfield operation, says Mr Ohiwa, 'so the support is a big
help'.
Nippondenso is using a site of 53 acres and has enough space to expand if
the market warrants it. Production will start in July 1992 with an initial
workforce of 160. It will be directed at all major European car
manufacturers, but Nippondenso has a contract to supply Toyota, with which
it has a long-term relationship, at its developing plant on the old
Burnaston airfield in Derbyshire.
The Telford venture will consolidate Nippondenso's position as the dominant
supplier in the UK of car ventilation equipment. Production of 800,000 units
a year is planned.
This position of dominance has been reached not only from Nippondenso's own
production but also through acquisition - IMI Radiators, for example.
Nippondenso's main competitors are in continental Europe.

FT  17 APR 91 / Survey of Telford &amp; Shropshire (2): 'Metal bashing' moves
over - Investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1963, the government of the day decided to try and bring about economic
regeneration in the Telford area by creating a new town with a development
corporation.
The chosen solution was to create a new town based on Dawley, but in 1968
the designated area was expanded to take in the more buoyant nearby towns of
Wellington and Oakengates and renamed Telford.
The idea was that jobs and investment would be drawn off from the busy West
Midlands. At the same time, the development corporation would use public
money to provide the land needed for factories, homes, roads and shops, and
would reclaim the violated landscape of slag heaps and played-out mines.
The problem was Telford's dependence on traditional, so-called 'metal
bashing' industries. When recession struck in the late 1970s, the local
economy was hit hard. As one development corporation official puts it, 'when
the national economy sneezed, Telford caught pneumonia'.
Between 1968-78, Telford's population increased from 75,000 to 100,000. But
growth in employment over the same period was more modest, from 36,000 to
45,000. Unemployment, which in 1968 had been 2.9 per cent, had risen to 7.9
per cent by 1978. In the following four years local engineering companies
were devastated, losing one-third of their employees. Unemployment continued
to rise, peaking at 22 per cent in 1984. Telford was almost back where it
had started in 1963.
Almost, but not entirely. By the early 1980s the development corporation had
received permission to spread its net beyond the West Midlands. It started
to pull in investors not only from south-east England, but also from
overseas.
Unusually for a town seeking new investment, Telford remains primarily a
manufacturing centre.
Although there has been some diversification into service industries, in
1990 manufacturing accounted for 44 per cent of total employment, against a
national average of 24 per cent.
The manufacturing base has been significantly diversified. Although
engineering is still important, the town is also a supplier of auto
components, office automation equipment and electrical goods. It is also
becoming an important centre for plastics production.
In the trying to attract new forms of investment, the development
corporation was helped by a number of factors which gelled in the early
1980s. The M54 motorway was opened. The town was designated an assisted
area, which meant that many forms of aid became available.
Some 270 acres of Telford were set aside as an enterprise zone, which meant
capital allowances and rates holidays. As the national economy recovered,
the area's engineering background and high unemployment meant there was a
pool of relatively cheap skilled labour.
But these advantages should not detract from the real marketing coups which
the development corporation has brought off. After years of trying, and
through the good offices of a high-powered agent in Tokyo, Mrs Mie Teno,
Telford managed to attract Hitachi Maxell to Telford. The company, which
manufactures video and audio cassettes and floppy discs, now employs more
than 500 people in the town.
Other Japanese companies followed. There are now 20 such concerns in
Telford, mostly manufacturing companies, employing 2,000 people. It is
thought that this is the largest concentration of Japanese investment in the
UK. Milton Keynes has more companies (34), but they do not employ so many
people and are are not so concentrated in manufacturing as Telford-based
companies.
While Japanese concerns have tended to make the headlines, there has been
considerable investment from other countries.
A total of 115 foreign companies have invested in Telford, creating 9,210
jobs and occupying 411,930 sq m of floor space. Of these, 32 came from the
US, 21 from Germany and eight from Sweden.
Taken together with the hundreds of British companies which have invested or
relocated to Telford since 1980, it means that around 30,000 jobs have been
created. Total gross investment has run into hundreds of millions of pounds.
Given what has happened in previous recessions, it is pertinent to ask
whether there will be a divestment or a collapse in employment. After
falling back to 5.5 per cent in 1990, unemployment is now back at 7.5 per
cent.
Mr Mike Morgan, the general manager of the development corporation, does not
think so. 'There are less than a dozen companies which employ more than 500
people. It is very different to the old days. It is now a much more
diversified economy. Moreover, most of the companies are on freehold
premises. There is very little leasehold. There is a much greater commitment
now. I do not think there is going to be any kind of exodus, although there
will be lay-offs and hardship.'

FT  17 APR 91 / Survey of Telford &amp; Shropshire (1): New phase for a new town
Recession has come as Telford and the county at large are beginning a
process of profound economic change. After the rapid expansion of the 1980s,
growth is slowing and unemployment is almost back to 1979 levels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE economic sun has dimmed over the county of Shropshire and its most
striking point of growth, Telford. Not that there is catastrophe in the air;
rather, that expectations fostered in the second half of the Thatcher decade
are blighted both by the present recession and the likelihood of slower
growth after it.
Retrospectively, the years from 1985 to 1989 look like a brilliant summer
for Telford, albeit rather duller for the rest of the county.
During that period, as the national economy strained to expand, Telford
grew. The new town, first conceived as an overspill for the Birmingham-Black
Country conurbation, found its feet independently: as it turned out, there
was not as much to spill over from the conurbation as had been envisaged 25
years ago. Companies arrived, not only from around the UK, but from
overseas.
The effect, in county terms, was startling. Of the industrial and
warehousing land taken up in Shropshire during the 1980s, 82 per cent was in
Telford. Job creation in Telford, part of the Wrekin district, overshadowed
what was taking place in the rest of the county.
'During the last 10 years', the county council says in a new economic
strategy document, 'Shropshire has experienced a massive cycle in
unemployment with rates returning in 1989 to almost the same rate as in
1979. The continued reduction in unemployment in the county since 1985
appears to have bottomed out and is now on a rising trend.'
Of all the counties in England, Shropshire evokes most strongly the notion
of the rural idyll.
But the dreamy quality of its landscape and the erroneous idea that it is
somehow geographically remote from urban strain hide the harsh fact that, in
the county at large, average earnings for male workers are the lowest in the
West Midlands region and the second lowest of any county in the UK.
Reduction of European Community farm subsidies and the ripple effects
throughout the local economy of diminishing farm incomes, although not
unique to Shropshire, are hurting badly.
Agricultural and industrial recession come together in Shropshire. Telford
has been buoyant and the announcements of new investment plans by various
companies continue to filter through.
But just as changes in national and European Community farming policy hurt
the rural county, so the fall in demand for manufactured products hurt
industrial Telford.
The closures of J. P. Woods at Craven Arms and Dairy Crest at Ellesmere were
the rural economy equivalents of the redundancies at the Telford
manufacturing plants of MCG Lancepack, Tatung (UK), IHW Engineering and
Birtley Building Products.
Unemployment in the Telford and Bridgnorth travel-to-work area, under the
national average at 5.4 per cent in January 1990, had crept up to 7.2 per
cent, the national average, by February 1991. Between January 1990 and
January 1991 the number of unfilled job vacancies fell by more than
one-third.
There are, then, jarring notes in the song of success which the Telford
Development Corporation, which runs the new town, has become accustomed
(with some justification) to chant.
It was able to ride the economic expansion of the late 1980s, attract new
companies and provide the new jobs because, during the lean years of the
early 1980s, it had created the serviced land and readied the facilities.
In a real sense, the Development Corporation had prepared the ground. New
jobs in Shropshire largely went to Telford.
However, Mr Robert Truslove, chief executive of the Shropshire Chamber of
Industry and Commerce, suggests that 'there is a danger in an area like
Shropshire of the creation of new jobs masking the difficulties that
companies are experiencing'.
There is the familiar litany of cashflow problems and interest rate
difficulties. But, for Shropshire in general and Telford in particular,
there is the hazard of inexperience.
'To survive a recession', Mr Truslove says, 'there are two things which are
useful. One is to have survived one before and the second is to have a track
record.
'A lot of the companies here are young, they were set up in the last 10
years, so a high proportion have never gone through a recession and don't
have a track record.'
Most of the new companies were set up in the second half of the 1980s and
high interest rates have hit them hard. 'They borrowed at low rates. When
they came to their second phase development they couldn't afford to fund
it', notes Mr Truslove.
It is a sign of the times that new business activity has slackened. In
1990-91, the number of companies in Shropshire withdrawing from value-added
tax registration was greater than those registering.
It is also a measure of the times that, as Mr Christopher Mackrell,
commercial director of the Telford Development Corporation, acknowledges,
the proportionate rate of growth in the new town is not as fast as in the
past: some projects are being deferred.
'The level of enquiries in pure number terms is down on what it was last
year', he says.
The recession catches both Telford and the county at large at the start of a
process of profound economic change. Clearly, rural Shropshire can no longer
rely on farming and its spin-off industries to maintain an acceptable
quality of life. The development of Telford is entering a new phase.
'Unemployment, the need for industrial/commercial land (and) falling
relative 'real' wages dictate the need for positive action and an adequate
supply of industrial and commercial land throughout the county if the
economy of the area is not to worsen during the next 10 years', declares the
county council.
Moves are being taken to buttress the rural economy with industry, to
encourage the growth of tourism and to wean the farming community away from
excessive reliance on bulk products to those with a higher added value. It
is a slow and painstaking task.
For its part, Telford will soon be in the throes of organisational change.
prise Zone, with its tax concessions, ends in 1993. The Telford Development
Corporation, its work done in providing a momentum of growth, is being wound
up and responsibility for the disposal of public assets passes to the
Commission for New Towns (CNT). The work of luring new companies passes to
the Telford Development Agency, to be established by Shropshire County
Council, Wrekin District Council and the CNT.
More important than organisational change, however, is the growth of a
services sector. Such a sector has always existed as a support for local
industry, but it is beginning to strike out on a life of its own as
organisations as diverse as the Inland Revenue's computer headquarters, the
Land Registry, TSB's training facilities and the Windsor Life Insurance
headquarters set up in the town.
The concomitant is an increase in pure office, as opposed to general
commercial property development - Pegasus Court, Central Park, the Telford
Business park, for example.
Industrial development will undoubtedly continue, if more slowly than in the
recent past. Mr Mackrell observes that 20 per cent of the available land in
the West Midlands is in Telford. But the growth of a services sector is an
indication of urban maturity. And maturity, by definition, implies steady
rather than headlong growth.

FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Elsevier sees increased growth
in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

ELSEVIER, the Dutch publisher, said yesterday that earnings growth will
improve from 1992 after slowing to a projected 10 per cent in 1991 because
of the company's plans to acquire Pergamon Press, the UK scientific
publisher.
In 1990, Elsevier posted a 17 per cent increase in after-tax earnings per
share, which the company regards as the best measure of its performance. As
reported, net profit soared by 60 per cent to Fl 507m (Dollars 268m).
Mr Pierre Vinken, the company chairman, said growth in net profit would slow
substantially in 1991 because 1990's net result had been boosted by
non-recurring items, mainly the book profits from Elsevier's sale of a 33
per cent stake in Wolters Kluwer, a fellow Dutch publisher.
This month, Elsevier also sold its 8.9 per cent stake in Pearson, the UK
publishing and banking group which owns the Financial Times. The proceeds of
both these divestments will enable Elsevier to finance most of its Pounds
440m (Dollars 787m) purchase of Pergamon, but the Dutch company will also
draw on a bridging loan of around Pounds 50m.
The loan will be paid back by the end of 1991, enabling profit growth to
resume its higher trend, Elsevier said.
Elsevier was already the world's biggest scientific publisher before it
announced plans to acquire Pergamon. Oce van der Grinten, the Dutch copier
and office systems group, said net profit in the first quarter of 1991 rose
by 5 per cent to Fl 19.1m on sales up 3 per cent at Fl 585.2m.
The first-quarter result marks a slight improvement from the full year 1990,
when net profit was barely changed at Fl 85.7m compared with Fl 84.7m in
1989 because of a rise in financial charges.
However, operating profit, which had showed an 8 per cent rise in 1990, fell
to Fl 36.1m in the 1991 first quarter from Fl 37.1m in the same period of
1990.

FT  17 APR 91 / La Generale hopes to raise BFr36bn: Group plans to wipe out
short-term debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale de Belgique plans to wipe out virtually all its short-term
debt through divestitures and a capital injection, the company said
yesterday. At the same time it announced a 39.4 per cent fall in net group
profit for 1990. The dividend is unchanged on 1989 at a net BFr84 a share.
La Generale, Belgium's largest holding company, said it hoped to raise
BFr36bn (Dollars 1.05bn) by year-end, and reduce the BFr30.3bn net
short-term debt of the parent company and wholly-owned financial
subsidiaries by at least BFr25bn.
It plans to raise BFr25bn by selling off parts of its portfolio, and BFr11bn
from its two main shareholders, Compagnie de Suez, the French financial
conglomerate which owns 61 per cent, and its insurance company AG, which
holds 14 per cent as head of the Generale consortium.
They will fully pay up the 18m shares issued in 1988 when Suez arrived to
stave off a hostile bid by Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian financier.
Mr Etienne Davignon, SGB chairman, emphasised however that 'the jewels of La
Generale are not going to be sold . . . this will not be a lottery.' He
specifically ruled out CBR, its cement business, Tractebel, its electricity
supplier, Generale de Banque, the banking arm, and AG.
The planned divestiture comes after net group profits fell to BFr12.2bn last
year, against BFr20.1 in 1989, and 'an even worse' first quarter this year.
Worst hit was the group's non-ferrous metals business, where earnings fell
to BFr2.5bn from BFr9.6bn in 1989, depressed by a weak dollar and a
precipitous fall in metals prices.
Higher financial costs from the parent company's increased debt ratios, and
the cost of disposing of most of FN, the stricken Belgian arms maker, were
the two other main reasons for what a group spokesman called 'a lousy year.'
Mr Gerard Mestrallet, sent in by Suez to take over from Mr Herve de Carmoy
as managing director earlier this year, said FN losses plus the cost of
redundancies had cost La Generale BFr5.6bn.
The holding company made significant disposals last year which bolstered its
profits, including stakes in two Belgian insurance companies, a French
construction group, and in Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecommunications
company. It reported extraordinary profits of BFr5.9bn.
The remnant of consolidated current earnings of BFr6.3bn, does not cover the
dividend payments of BFr6.8bn, raising questions among brokers about the
adequacy of its portfolio. 'That is exactly what we're going to work on by
clearing the debt,' a spokesman for the company said.

FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Ciments Francais sales slips 2%
in three months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES volumes at Ciments Francais, the world's third largest cement maker,
fell by 2 per cent in the first three months of the year, but the group does
not expect a drop in business for the whole of 1991.
Mr Pierre Conso, the group chairman, warned yesterday that 1991 would be 'a
year of transition' from the previous five years of growth. Net profits at
Ciments Francais rose by 16.3 per cent to FFr1.3bn (Dollars 229.8m) last
year on turnover up by 23.9 per cent to FFr15.45bn.
The group, holder of second place in the French cement industry after
Lafarge Coppee  - the world's largest  - said the downturn in demand was
worst in North America, where the group made 16.5 per cent of its sales last
year.
Volumes in the US and Canada fell by up to 25 per cent in the first quarter
of 1991, reflecting the impact of a hard winter on construction activity,
coming on top of the recession, said Mr Conso.
French demand picked up slightly in April, while sales through the first
quarter were holding up well in Morocco and Turkey, where Ciments Francais
is building two plants, as well as in Greece and Spain.

FT  17 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Market weakens on the latest data
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London equities staged a sharp reversal yesterday as early bid talk was
overwhelmed by concern that the next cut in UK interest rates was several
months away.
The initial strength followed Hanson's Pounds 500m cash raising exercise in
the Euromarkets. A familiar list of possible bid targets did the rounds in
the market, and several of them managed to hold on to small gains made as a
result. This speculative activity initially pushed the FT-SE 100 index to a
new intra day high of 2555.3 but trading was light and the rise almost
immediately triggered selling of Footsie futures contracts.
Sentiment was not helped by suggestions that the Bundesbank might raise
German interest rates at its fortnightly meeting tomorrow. Last week another
German rate, the repo, moved slightly higher and shares were similarly edgy
before the last Bundesbank meeting.
Some analysts suggested that a rise of about half a percentage point was a
possibility tomorrow, although money market activity in Frankfurt appeared
to point to no immediate change.
The London mood darkened further as the latest statistics on UK output
prices underscored the market's view that there was a floor under interest
rates. Factory gate prices rose 0.7 per cent last month, leaving the annual
rate at 6.3 per cent for the third month in succession.
If traders and investors needed confirmation that this implied that the
underlying rate of inflation is still a problem for the government, they had
only to look at the money markets. If inflation stays high, as output price
statistics suggest, so will the price of money.
Three month interbank rate - which is an expectation of the average base
rate over the next three months - closed at 11 7/8 per cent, compared with
the base rate now of 12 per cent.
The gilts market was dull as a result. Much of last week's tap stock issue
remained unsold and prices generally were trimmed. 'It is cheaper to buy in
the market,' said Mr Paul Walton at James Capel.
Mr Walton added that equity strategists were trying to anticipate the effect
the May local government elections might have on share price sentiment.
Analysts were preparing contingency responses to both good and bad
performances by the ruling Conservative party.
Sterling lost some ground yesterday and this led several
large-capitalisation issues to underperform an already slipping stockmarket.
Shares fell steadily from the day's peak, not helped by a weak opening on
Wall Street, to end just above the day's low at 2519.5, a net decline of
23.3. The swing on the day was more than 37 points.
Turnover at 446m shares was a little higher than the previous session's
depressed level but still less than the volume the market has become
accustomed to in the bull run that started in January.
The reversal of fortune was also seen in the futures market, which moved in
a 50 point range. Traders said that the June contract dropped through a
support level, and it continued to fall in after-hours trading.
Apart from Hanson, corporate news was thin on the ground. There was one
small rights issue from engineering group EIS.
It served as another reminder to the market that with the Footsie so near
its all-time high that more, and larger, rights issues are likely in the
short term.

FT  17 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Hong Kong falters over airport
stalemate - Unfriendly noises from China have reversed a dramatic bull run,
says John Elliott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG's politically sensitive stock market has run into one of its
jittery periods, caused as usual by unfriendly and destabilising noises from
China, which regains sovereignty over the British colony in 1997.
China's target is Hong Kong's plan to build a HKDollars 100bn (USDollars
12.7bn) international airport. The stock market lost its nerve after Mr
Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, failed to generate an agreement
by visiting Peking earlier this month.
This reversed a dramatic bull run which took the local Hang Seng index up
from around 3,000 at the begining of the year to 3,869.7 a fortnight ago -
only about 80 points below the all-time high of 3,949.73 reached just before
the 1987 world markets crash.
The run staggered almost all brokers and analysts because they had not
expected the index to move far above 3,300-3,500 for most of this year. At
its peak it caused serious concern because of the risk of gambling fever
overtaking the colony's ethnic Chinese community and because of the possible
destabilising impact of a heavy correction.
But the correction has not been too severe and the market seems to have
adjusted to the airport impasse. The index is now hovering around
3,700-3,800. It closed yesterday at 3,717.46, just 3.09 points up on the day
amid confusion created by mixed signals from China about the airport. Volume
fell to HKDollars 1.12bn from HKDollars 1.15bn.
The bull run outdistanced other markets during and after the Gulf war
because Hong Kong was underpriced against other markets in the region and
was waiting for a major event to generate activity. International
institutions, which were light on Hong Kong, led the buying spree and then
instigated the correction after it was clear that the market had risen too
far too fast.
Analysts now believe that it could take some time for momentum to build up
again - unless there was an unexpectedly rapid agreement on the airport,
which would generate an instant mood of euphoria because it would help to
smooth relations with China. On the other hand, a total failure to agree,
and consequential shelving of the project, would strike a severe blow to
confidence and the market.
The airport is significant because the Hong Kong government estimates that
it needs to raise about 25 per cent of the project cost from the private
sector in the form of bonds and direct equity investment. Since the pay-back
period will not start till after 1997, investors will want to be sure that
the project is backed by China. That backing has not yet materialised, for a
mixture of political and economic reasons, and the Hong Kong government is
now considering whether to attempt a new compromise.
If it were not for the airport problem the mood would be much more buoyant.
The economy is picking up, fuelled especially by recovery in southern China,
and forecasts for this year's growth range around 4 per cent to 5 per cent
compared with 2.5 per cent last year. These forecasts might be adjusted
upwards if the US economy recovers significantly later this year.
The half-year season of corporate results has just ended without any
unexpected bad news and there are optimistic earnings forecasts for the full
year and for 1992. Relaxations, announced at the weekend, of a ban on
companies buying back their own shares could also spur activity.
On the negative side, hassles in the US over China's most favoured nation
status might knock confidence this year because removal of the status would
hit Hong Kong industry and trade. There could be some politically-inspired
nervousness late in the summer ahead of the first ever direct elections to
the colony's legislative council.
However, there is generally more optimism than gloom about prospects later
in the year, however, subject to the China and airport factors. 'After a
period of consolidation, we'll be looking at an index of 4,000 by July,'
says Mr Barry Yates, research director of Asia Equity Holdings.

FT  17 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Good company results lift
equities after weak start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
THE STOCK market shrugged aside early unfavourable economic news to move
sharply higher in busy trading yesterday on the back of good corporate
results from leading companies, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 53.71 at 2,986.88,
within sighting distance of its all-time high of just below 3,000. The
broader-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also markedly firmer, up 6.43 at
387.62, while the Nasdaq composite index of over the counter stocks bounced
back from Monday's losses to rise 5.91 to 506.75, another new record. NYSE
turnover was exceptionally heavy at 215m shares, with advances outpacing
declines by over two to one.
Prices opened weaker on news of a 0.3 per cent fall in March industrial
production and an unexpectedly large decline in March housing starts. Some
analysts had hoped that a rebound in the number of new houses built would
confirm that the economic recovery was under way.
A sprinkling of positive corporate first quarter results sparked a rally,
however, with the bulk of the gains earned late in the session. A public
prediction that interest rates would come down further from Mr Michael
Boskin, chief economic adviser to the White House, also helped sentiment.
Leading the way with good quarterly earnings was the giant drug company
Merck, whose shares rose Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 113 on news of a rise in
first quarter earnings from Dollars 1.03 a share last year to Dollars 1.25.
American Home Products also did well on good results, advancing Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 62 after reporting a rise in three-month income to a record
Dollars 352.4m on net sales of Dollars 1.76bn. The company also announced a
new product to treat prostate enlargement.
Citicorp rose Dollars  3/8 higher to Dollars 16 3/8 on turnover of 2m shares
in spite of reporting a big drop in quarterly earnings from 60 cents a share
in the first three months of 1990 to 10 cents a share this year. The banking
group warned that 1991 would be difficult but with the bad news already
discounted, the market took little notice.
Of the other banks to report earnings yesterday pride of place went to West
coast bank Wells Fargo, which jumped Dollars 7 1/2 to Dollars 80 on better
than expected profits. Also higher were Manufacturers Hanover, up Dollars
7/8 to Dollars 27 7/8 , Chemical Bank, Dollars 3/4 firmer at Dollars 20 3/8
, and Mellon Bank, up Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 32.
Securities houses again shone with large improvements in quarterly profits.
Merrill Lynch, Wall Street's biggest brokerage, climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 41 1/4 on news of a 338 per cent jump in first quarter income to
Dollars 181m.
On the secondary market Apple Computers steadied after Monday's losses,
climbing Dollars 2 to Dollars 64 1/4 . The stock had fallen on poor
quarterly earnings. In contrast, Intergraph, the computer graphics system
manufacturer, reported first quarter income of 41 cents a share, above
analysts' expectations, sending the shares Dollars 2 higher to Dollars 30
7/8 .
Canada
Toronto prices responded to the afternoon rally in New York and closed
higher in moderate trading.
The 300 composite index, barely changed through most of the session, jumped
in the late going to close at 3539.73, up 23.30. Volume of 22,562,000 shares
was below yesterday's 24,779,000 shares and trading value was CDollars
234.9m (CDollars 256.4m). Winning issues were ahead of losers by 315 to 256.

FT  17 APR 91 / Government Bonds: German bonds hit by wave of heavy futures
selling
</HEADLINE>

HEAVY selling of German government bonds in the cash and futures markets
yesterday afternoon pushed prices down.
Traders expressed surprise as the London International Financial Futures
Exchange Bund future moved through a half-point range yesterday to close at
85.46, suggesting significant selling.
The spread between 10-year German bunds and 10-year French government
securities narrowed to less than 50 basis points. Traders said there had
been a narrowing of the spread in recent days as dealers had marked down
prices in the German market more swiftly than in the French.
Some traders pointed out that the narrowing of the spread could tempt
investors to switch into German bunds. Investors have been selling German
bunds and buying Spanish bonds and UK government bonds.
There are hopes of further interest-rate cuts in these markets, whereas in
the German market the Bundesbank might raise the official interest rate when
its council meets on Thursday.
UK GOVERNMENT bond prices slipped to close down on the day, having increased
slightly as news of the Bank of England's gilt auction were announced
yesterday afternoon.
As prices rose, some dealers sold. The market was not helped by the poor
performance of the US and German markets.
The Bank of England announced that it was to auction a further Pounds 1.2bn
tranche of 10 per cent conversion stock due 1996 on April 24. The existing
stock closed down  1/32 point, as did the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due
2003/07.
The existing 9 per cent Treasury stock due in 2008 closed at 93 1/16 . The
Bank offered a further Pounds 800m of the stock last week with a minimum
tender price of 94 1/2 , which was undersubscribed, and the market is
speculating that the Bank may have to cut the minimum tender price.
JAPANESE government bond prices rallied in response to a domestic news
report that the Bank of Japan would ease monetary policy.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 10-year government bond fell from 6.72 per
cent at Monday's close to a low of 6.615 per cent on the news. However, a
Bank of Japan official later denied the story and emphasised the Bank's
commitment to tight monetary policy. The yield closed in Tokyo at 6.635 per
cent.
Traders in London said they expected to see some profit-taking at the long
end of the market with investors switching into medium-dated bonds. Yen
weakness prompted some light selling among European investors, traders said.
US government bond prices recovered from early weakness yesterday to end
slightly firmer after Mr Michael Boskin, the White House chief economic
adviser, predicted interest rates would fall further.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year bond was up  3/32 at 97 9/32 ,
yielding 8.111 per cent. The two-year note, however was slightly easier,
down  1/32 at 100 7/16 , to yield 6.862 per cent.
Although Mr Boskin has direct influence on monetary policy, his remarks were
taken as fresh evidence that the pressure is still on the Federal Reserve to
ease policy.
Earlier government figures showed industrial production fell 0.3 per cent in
March and housing starts - regarded as a useful leading indicator of
economic trends - declined 9.3 per cent in the month.
Bonds eased after the figures were released, which suggested that
disappointment at the lack of an interest rate cut from the Fed counteracted
the normally positive impact on prices of bad economic news.

FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: The real thing returns to India
 -Gita Piramel on Coca-Cola's move into a market of 860m consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GITA PIRAMEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For parched Coca-Cola aficionados in India deprived of the real thing, happy
days may be on the horizon.
Talks aimed at reintroducing the fizzy drink into India are under way
between Coke and Britannia Brands, an Asia-Pacific snack food processor with
annual sales of Dollars 400m.
'Yes, it is true that talks are going on, but it is too early to make a
comment,' said Mr Rajan Pillai, UK-based head of Britannia Brands.
His reluctance to talk to the media is understandable given the project's
political sensitivity.
In fact, this is the US group's third recent attempt to get back to a market
it walked away from in 1977 following an Indian requirement that most
foreign companies reduce their equity holdings in subsidiaries to 40 per
cent. Both Coke and IBM immediately pulled out of India.
But since PepsiCo, Coke's rival, acquired a toehold in India, one of the
fastest growing soft drink markets in the world, Coke quickly modified its
scruples. At the time Coke 20m cases. Last year, sales bubbled up to more
than 110m cases, according to industry specialists.
To breach the heavily-fortified market, the US multinational shopped around
for allies. Once it became known that Coke was looking out for an Indian
partner, a fiery fight broke out among local businessmen.
Godrej (India's biggest privately-controlled business house), Parle (the
biggest soft drink manufacturer with 70 per cent of the local market) and
Pure Drinks (Coke's pre-1977 distributor) were among the keenest contenders.
It appears that Mr Pillai won on two points: his contacts in Delhi's
political corridors; and Britannia's far-flung snack food empire with
manufacturing facilities in six Asian and Pacific countries.
Britannia, in fact, is probably a rare Indian group which can tailor its
application in line with Indian government regulations with their heavy
export commitment clauses. In return for permission to bottle and sell Coke
in India, Mr Pillai has guaranteed export sales of Rs8bn (Dollars 400m)
spread over 10 years.
This will be done by moving an extruded potato crisp plant from Singapore to
India, probably in a high priority-investment area in Maharashtra. 'This
plant is already selling Rs300m worth of crisps worldwide. So we are
offering real production and sure exports, not pie in the sky,' said Mr
Pillai. However, it may be some time before Coke arrives on the shelves of
Indian stores.
With Indian elections scheduled for May 23, neither businessmen, politicians
nor bureaucrats want to pick up more hot potatoes than they have to.
Even if and when production starts, success is shaky. Its been a long time -
more than 13 years - since the Indian population of 860m had access to Coke.
Now there is a whole new generation bred on the taste of rival brands.
Can Coke's world-famous brand wean the new jean generation away from the
highly popular Indian brands?
Going by Pepsi's latest experience (in a venture with the Tatas and the
Punjab state government, the company launched Lehar-Pepsi across India last
year), this is going to be a big problem for foreign colas.
Last month PepsiCo's Indian operation reported a 1990 loss of Rs130m.
Nonetheless, the Indian soft drinks market is worth Rs10bn a year and is
growing.

FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: United Technologies' first
quarter hit by recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE impact of the US recession on the airline, building and automotive
industries has severely hurt first-quarter earnings at United Technologies,
the diversified engineering group, which yesterday turned in results that
were significantly worse than expected.
Although the company had warned that earnings in the first half of 1991
would decline, the first-quarter net earnings of Dollars 40.2m, or 25 cents
a share, were sharply below the 75 cents a share anticipated by most
analysts. 'I had expected a bad quarter and reduced my estimates to 50 cents
a share,' said one analyst, 'but these figures were terrible.'
In the first three months of 1990, UTC had net earnings of Dollars 134.5m,
or Dollars 1.01 a share. Revenues were flat at Dollars 4.8bn in both years.
Mr Robert Daniell, chairman and chief executive, said harsh economic
conditions had a severe impact on first-quarter performance. 'Airline
travel, building construction and automobile production; all are down
sharply. This is the first time all three of these core commercial markets
simultaneously have been at the bottom of their industrial cycles.
'We are not running our businesses on the assumption that the recession is
nearing an end,' he added.
Operating income in UTC's power segment plunged to Dollars 113m from Dollars
249m a year ago.
At UTC's Pratt &amp; Whitney aero-engine business, which recently said it would
cut between 1,000 and 1,500 jobs by the end of June, revenues from its
lucrative spare parts business dropped 25 per cent in the first quarter. The
company blamed the decline on sharply reduced airline travel and poor
financial results at the airlines.

TRANS World Airlines, the heavily-indebted carrier, yesterday repeated its

FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Kroger returns to the black with
Dollars 5.4m net
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KROGER, the large US retail grocery chain which took on a hefty debt load
when it conducted a defensive restructuring in 1988, yesterday reported
first-quarter earnings of Dollars 5.36m after tax. This compares with a
Dollars 10.3m deficit in the same period a year earlier.
The figure was scored on sales up by 7.6 per cent at Dollars 4.91bn, with
like-for-like sales rising by 5 per cent. Profits before interest, tax and
depreciation, rose by 11 per cent to Dollars 212.7m.
The net figure, however, is struck after interest charges of Dollars 125.2m,
and an extraordinary charge of Dollars 5.43m - the latter relating to the
early retirement of group debt. In the previous year, interest charges were
almost 6 per cent higher at Dollars 132.9m, but there were no extraordinary
charges.
Kroger's chairman, Mr Joseph Pichler, said that the decline in financing
costs was partly due to a lower total debt load, and to moves taken to
restructure the debt so that its cost was reduced. Kroger geared itself up
when it undertook a large restructuring - involving the payment of a
sizeable one-off dividend to shareholders - designed to see off two unwanted
takeover bids.
Mr Pichler added that the sales growth had been spread over the group's
retail operations, which range from supermarkets to convenience stores.
Particularly strong performances came from own-label and speciality goods,
such as delicatessen, floral and pharmacy products.

FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Top banks held back by loan-loss
provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO LEADING New York-based retail bank groups, Chemical Banking Corp and
Manufacturers Hanover, have reported substantial declines in first-quarter
earnings, largely due to continuing problems with loan portfolios.
Chemical's earnings fell to Dollars 87m, or 74 cents a share, from Dollars
151.7m, or Dollars 1.55, a year earlier. Net of a restructuring charge and a
gain from the disposal of a Florida banking group, last year's earnings were
Dollars 101.7m.
Earnings at Manufacturers dropped to Dollars 78m, or 87 cents a share, from
Dollars 96m, or Dollars 1.21.
Chemical's net interest income grew by almost 14 per cent due to the impact
of lower interest rates on margins and a higher level of outstanding credit
card balances.
However fee and other non-interest income fell by 4.3 per cent as a result
of lower trust revenue following the disposal of some businesses late last
year, and of lower loan service charges.
Loan write-offs, excluding third world loans, jumped to Dollars 120.9m from
Dollars 59m, and loan-loss provisions rose to Dollars 135m from Dollars 70m.
Non-performing loans, excluding third world debt, stood at Dollars 2bn on
March 31, a 6.2 per cent increase since December.
Manufacturers' loan-loss provisions have doubled in the past year to Dollars
144m. Although several of the bank's businesses have continued to perform
well, its overall earnings have also been dented by higher deposit insurance
premiums, investment in retail banking systems and the impact of the strong
dollar on overseas expenses.
Mounting loan loss provisions, especially in the troubled property market,
have also pushed down first-quarter earnings at two leading California-based
banks, Security Pacific and Wells Fargo.
SecPac's earnings tumbled by almost a half to Dollars 96.5m, or 71 cents a
share, from Dollars 188.4m, or Dollars 1.54, a year earlier. Wells Fargo's
income dipped to Dollars 152m or Dollars 2.86, from Dollars 160m, or Dollars
3.04, last time.
The one bright spot in SecPac's results was a 16 per cent jump in fee and
other non-interest income. However this was more than offset by a 3 per cent
drop in interest income, a 7 per cent rise in operating expenses, and a
near-doubling in credit loss provisions to Dollars 271.1m, from Dollars
139.7m.
SecPac's first-quarter provision was Dollars 97.9m higher than actual loan
losses, excluding third world debt. Losses of Dollars 173.2m in the latest
three months were substantially down from the Dollars 367.1m in the fourth
quarter of 1990.
Non-performing loans were Dollars 2.3bn on March 31, up from Dollars 2.1bn
in December and Dollars 1.7bn a year ago. The increase is centred on
commercial property business in Britain and the US, outside California, as
well as other domestic loans.
Wells Fargo's net interest income climbed to Dollars 631m from Dollars 560m,
while fee and other non-interest earnings rose to Dollars 204m from Dollars
200m. Loan loss provisions, however, rose to Dollars 85m from Dollars 75m,
and loan write-offs moved up to Dollars 67m.
Wells Fargo's portfolio of problem loans, including non-accrual and
restructured credits, totalled Dollars 1.1bn on March 31, up from Dollars
1bn three months earlier, and Dollars 752m on March 31 1990.
Mellon Bank Corp, of Pittsburgh, said its higher first-quarter net income
reflected increases in net interest revenue and service fee revenue. This
was partly offset by increases in operating expenses and the provision for
credit losses, as well as lower trading revenues.
Net earnings rose to Dollars 68m from Dollars 65m.

FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Scott Paper declines heavily
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTT PAPER, the world's largest producer of toilet tissue, paper towels and
napkins, yesterday combined news of a 51 per cent slump in first-quarter net
earnings, with details of top management changes.
Scott said it made Dollars 29.3m after tax in the three months to March 30,
on sales of Dollars 1.23bn, compared with Dollars 60.1m last time.
However, the 1991 figures exclude earnings and sales from those
'non-strategic' businesses which Scott has put up for sale. If these were
also excluded from the 1990 results, sales would have risen year-on-year by
10 per cent, while operating income would have declined by 17 per cent. The
1990 contribution to net income from these businesses was negligible.
Scott blamed the profits drop on the depressed US economic environment, and
on the repairs to the recovery boiler needed at its Somerset mill in Maine.
These factors, it said, caused a sharp earnings fall at S. D. Warren, the
printing and publishing papers subsidiary.
By contrast, it suggested that Scott Worldwide, the personal care and
cleaning business, showed improved results, while the international
operations had 'an excellent quarter'. Earnings in Europe advanced by 70 per
cent, thanks to an improvement in the UK and the inclusion of results from
the Scott-Feldmuhle sanitary tissues joint ventures, formed at the end of
last year.
Meanwhile, as part of an executive reorganisation, Mr Richard Leaman,
previously president of Scott Worldwide, is becoming vice-chairman of the
company and president of S. D. Warren. Mr Robert McAvoy, former head of S.
D. Warren, 'has elected to retire'.
Mr Philip Lippincott, group chairman, said the changes resulted from 'the
critical need for us to improve our short-term performance and reduce our
debt'.

UNITED Telecommunications, the US long-distance telephone company, unveiled
a sharp decline in first-quarter earnings yesterday, while Pacific Telesis,
the West Coast regional telephone company, saw first-quarter earnings rise
modestly.
UT's income fell to Dollars 84m, or 38 cents per share, from Dollars 108m,
or 51 cents, in the same period a year ago. Revenues were ahead to Dollars
2.2bn, up 7 per cent from Dollars 2bn a year ago.
Operating profit at Sprint, the long distance division, was Dollars 52m on
revenues of Dollars 1.3bn for the quarter, against Dollars 51m on revenues
of Dollars 1.3bn in the preceding quarter.
Sprint's increased traffic volumes were offset principally by a decline from
strong fourth-quarter data systems sales, and by some decrease in the
average rate per minute of long distance usage in the first quarter, the
company said.
At Pacific Telesis, first-quarter income rose 1.5 per cent to Dollars 266m,
from Dollars 262m in the same quarter a year ago. Earnings per share were 68
cents, up 4.6 per cent from 65 cents. Revenues were Dollars 2.41bn, compared
with Dollars 2.37bn in the first quarter of 1990.
Pacific Bell, its principle telephone subsidiary , reported net income for
the quarter of Dollars 245m, up slightly from Dollars 242m in the first
quarter of 1990. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 2.16bn, compared with
Dollars 2.12bn in 1990.

MICROSOFT, the leading personal computer software publisher, reported record
revenues and profits for its third fiscal quarter, exceeding analysts
expectations, writes Louise Kehoe.
Revenues for the quarter jumped 57 per cent to Dollars 486.9m from Dollars
310.9m in the same period last year. Third-quarter net income was Dollars
123.8m, or 98 cents per share, an increase of 65 per cent over Dollars
75.2m, or 62 cents, a year ago.
Revenues for the nine months ended March 31, 1991, were Dollars 1.3bn, 56
per cent more than the Dollars 846.5m for the same period of fiscal 1990.
Net income for the nine months rose 63 per cent to Dollars 324.3m, or
Dollars 2.61 per share, from Dollars 199.2m, or Dollars 1.69, a year ago.
Microsoft's performance is remarkable in light of slowing sales growth in
the personal computer market, particularly in the US. The company said it
achieved record revenues from retail sales of applications programs and from
sales of operating system software through computer manufacturers.

FT  17 APR 91 / UK Company News: EIS builds up bid cash with Pounds 18m
rights - Profits advance of 13% to Pounds 12m represents 20th year of growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIS GROUP, the specialist engineer, is stoking up its acquisition fund with
an Pounds 18.3m rights issue that will add to cash already held.
The group, which has made 14 purchases over the past five years, also
announced its 20th year of profit growth with a pre-tax figure ahead by
almost 13 per cent from Pounds 11.95m to Pounds 13.48m in 1990 on turnover
up 13 per cent at Pounds 177.52m.
The shares rose 3p to 330p on the announcement of the 1-for-4 issue, at 265p
per share. It is two years since EIS's last rights issue which raised Pounds
12.5m.
Mr Peter Haslehurst, chief executive, said that on that occasion the group
had slipped into debt of about Pounds 2m after a series of acquisitions.
This time the cash raised would help avoid short-term borrowings.
'We like to have cash, and not just when interest rates are high. It's
useful when negotiating with vendors, particularly outside the UK,' he said.
Many of its acquisitions would continue to be overseas. Last year the group
made 34 per cent of its sales and just over half its pre-tax profit in the
UK, with other EC countries accounting for 32 per cent of turnover, America
17 per cent and Asia 11 per cent.
Net cash held by the group declined from Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 5m. Interest
income was Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 965,000).
Acquisitions absorbed Pounds 4m and brought in Pounds 4m debt. Capital
spending, notably on computer-controlled machine tools and computer-aided
design equipment, rose to Pounds 7.7m (Pounds 6.9m).
All three division improved their contributions. In the Flexibox seals and
couplings group, operating profit increased to Pounds 4.67m (Pounds 4.16m)
on sales of Pounds 45.86m (Pounds 40.12m).
Process equipment made Pounds 4.43m (Pounds 4.04m) on sales of Pounds 86.08m
(Pounds 77.29m), in spite of a halt in exports to Iraq and Kuwait which led
to a Pounds 505,000 extraordinary provision.
The reorganised aircraft and precision engineering division improved to
Pounds 3.17m after a decline to Pounds 2.63m in 1989.
Mr Haslehurst said action to ward off the effects of recession had included
maximising exports and reducing costs.
Earnings per share, affected by the 1989 share issue, rose 8 per cent to
29.949p (27.685p). A proposed final dividend of 8.375p makes a total of
11.4p (10.45p).
COMMENT
EIS is full of old-fashioned virtues such as rigorous cash management,
investment to improve productivity and a painstaking approach to
acquisition. The decision to launch a rights issue when it still has cash in
the bank is typical of its conservative approach. The policy has worked like
clockwork so far. Through the 1980s, it had a rights issue every two or
three years, always in April, and the resultant purchases have proved their
worth. It will, however, be tough for it to continue earnings per share
growth this year, even if pre-tax profit advances to about Pounds 15m. A
prospective p/e of 11.2 puts it on a small premium to the engineering
sector. Further progress in the price will depend on the scope of future
acquisitions.

MR MEL Blumenthal, chief operating officer of MTM, the US production

chief executive. Further job cuts are expected after his appointment.
The changes come as TVS starts to prepare its bid to retain its south of
England ITV franchise which has to be submitted on May 15.
The management of the ITV company, which took MTM off the market in the past
few days after failing to find an acceptable buyer at the right price, is
now trying to streamline the US company. The great danger is that MTM will
be seen as a source of potential financial instability when the Independent
Television Commission decides on the bids.
The purchase of MTM was the most dramatic diversification of Mr James
Gatward, the former TVS chief executive who won the original franchise. It
also turned out to be his undoing.
He left the company earlier this year after the arrival of Mr Rudolph Agnew
as chairman.
TVS is one of the strongest advertising regions in the country and the
company is likely to face opposition from at least three serious bidders -
Carlton Communications, MAI, the advertising and financial services group,
and a consortium which brings together David Frost and Richard Branson.

FT  17 APR 91 / UK Company News: Peugeot Talbot declines 11% and warns of
worse to come
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEUGEOT TALBOT, the UK subsidiary of Peugeot, the French car maker, reported
an 11 per cent decline in pre-tax profits from a record Pounds 123m to
Pounds 109m in 1990.
Mr Geoffrey Whalen, managing director, warned that profits would be 'clearly
worse' this year in the face of the continuing steep recession in the UK new
car market.
However, last year Peugeot Talbot still achieved its second best financial
result since Peugeot took over the chronically loss-making UK operations of
Chrysler (formerly the Rootes group) in 1978.
Output rose by 8.5 per cent last year to 116,500 vehicles, the highest level
achieved by the Ryton plant since 1971. Production has risen for five years
in succession from only 19,977 in 1985.
Mr Whalen said that productivity rose by more than 12 per cent last year,
while inventory levels had been reduced to five days supply compared with 15
days two years ago.
Turnover rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 1.6bn. Net profits fell by 29 per cent
from Pounds 104m to Pounds 74m, as the company became liable for a full tax
charge after exhausting carry-forward losses in 1989.
Importantly the company disclosed yesterday that it would revert to
producing two model ranges at the Ryton assembly plant from mid-1992, when
it adds production of a new lower-medium segment car to the existing Peugeot
405 range.
The new range will replace the existing Peugeot 309 in the European market
next year.
The 309 was produced at Ryton from 1986 to 1989, when production was
switched exclusively to the 405 in order to ease capacity constraints at
Peugeot's French assembly plants.
Mr Whalen said that work to prepare for the addition of the new range had
already begun at Ryton and would involve a modest degree of automation at
the currently highly labour intensive plant.
The Peugeot group had previously decided against substantial extra
investment at Ryton, however, in favour of increasing capacity at its main
French plants.
Peugeot Talbot said yesterday that car production at Ryton was expected to
fall by at least 23 per cent this year to about 90,000 in the face of
declining new car demand in both the UK and continental European markets.
The company has already cut more than 700 jobs in the last six months
reducing its workforce to just over 7,000.
The plant has been working a four-day week for much of this year with 14
production days eliminated in order to reduce output.
The rate of production has been cut to 2,100 a week from a peak of 2,650
last year, but Mr Whalen said that five-day working would be resumed in May.
Peugeot car sales in the UK last year fell by 11 per cent to 124,000
compared with a fall in the overall UK new car market of 12.7 per cent.
As a result the Peugeot marque increased its share of the market modestly to
6.2 per cent from 6 per cent a year earlier.
In the first quarter of this year Peugeot further increased its market share
to 7 per cent.
Sales fell by 8.6 per cent to 31,857 compared with a plunge in the overall
market of 21.6 per cent.

FT  17 APR 91 / UK Company News: Rationalisation fails to prevent Hartons'
setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECONOMIC downturn in the UK dealt a harsh blow to Hartons Group, the
distributor of plastic sheet and film, which saw profits of Pounds 608,000
in 1989 turn into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.14m last year.
Steps to rationalise operations failed to counter a sharp fall in demand for
the group's products. Turnover, which during the year fell 16 per cent to
Pounds 128.84m (Pounds 153m), was down 14 per cent in the fourth quarter.
Last year's decline 'truly reflected the state of the economy,' said Mr
Colin Astin, chairman. The group's wide customer spread covers a
cross-section of the general economy and for that reason 'when the economy
goes down our business goes down.'
In an effort to stem its sagging profits, Hartons embarked on a
reorganisation programme, closing 11, or a third, of its distribution
branches in the UK and rationalising operations in the remaining 20. These
measures were behind an exceptional debit of Pounds 1.23m.
Additionally, the disposal of the Wakeling Medical manufacturing company and
the closure of its only distribution outlet in Ireland, resulted in an
extraordinary loss of Pounds 578,000. Wakeling was sold at net asset value
of Pounds 215,000.
The effect of the recession on customers, which comprise mainly smaller to
medium-sized companies, was reflected in the increase in bad and doubtful
debt provisions to Pounds 1m.
Among overseas operations, which contribute half of turnover, North America
was hit by deteriorating economic conditions whereas European markets
generally put in a firm performance. France produced record profits on
turnover up 10 per cent while Spain saw turnover increase by 8 per cent.
The group will continue rationalising operations that are not essential to
its longer-term objectives, Mr Astin said. Any disposals would not be in the
UK and would be aimed at concentrating the group's activities on plastics
distribution.
Benefits of the rationalisation should emerge this year. Borrowings have
come down and working capital has been released as a result of lower
interest charges and closures.
'Nothing's changed and it all looks very grim,' Mr Astin said, 'but people
for the first time in many months are begining to talk positively.' The
group saw a slight improvement in March, he said.
Losses per share came to 3.6p (0.06p) and no final dividend is proposed. The
total for the year is 0.1p (0.2p).

FT  17 APR 91 / Hanson issues Pounds 500m bond: Group denies market
speculation of big takeover bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, yesterday launched a Pounds 500m
convertible Eurobond, the largest sterling convertible yet seen in the
international market.
The move triggered widespread market speculation that Hanson was about to
make a sizeable takeover bid, although Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman of
Hanson, said the issue was 'no signal in that sense'.
Mr Taylor said the two aims of the bond were to reduce its sterling
borrowing costs and give international investors a new opportunity to buy
into Hanson.
Analysts pointed out that Hanson had net cash of more than Pounds 500m in
its September 30 balance sheet, and estimated that its borrowing powers
permitted it to spend up to Pounds 18bn. They said the issue was small
compared with Hanson's market value of Pounds 10.6bn at last night's share
price close of 220p, down 5p. The analysts added that a large takeover would
probably involve issuing shares anyway.
Names suggested as possible targets for a Hanson bid included Pilkington,
the glassmaker; Boots, the retail and pharmaceutical group; and the William
Hill betting shop business of Brent Walker, the leisure company.
The bond issue appeared to achieve Hanson's aims. There was substantial
demand from European institutional investors, centred on Switzerland, said
banks involved in the deal.
Most of the paper was placed with new investors, unlike some other
convertible bond issues by UK companies. The strength of demand for
convertible bonds among international investors could attract other UK
companies to the market.
Mr Taylor said that the coupon of 9 1/2 per cent on the bond compares with
current borrowing costs of about 12 per cent in the UK.
In February, Hanson announced a Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.4bn) commercial
paper programme in the US to cut the cost of its short-term dollar
borrowings. Mr Taylor said that well over Dollars 2bn had been issued under
this programme already.
The bonds convert into Hanson ordinary shares at 258 3/4 p, a premium of 15
per cent over the closing share price on Monday. They have a final maturity
date of 2006.
Analysts said that due to the saving on interest costs, the bond should
slightly enhance Hanson's fully-diluted earnings.
On full conversion of the bond, Hanson's share capital would increase by 3.7
per cent, well within the 5 per cent limit set by institutional investors
for issues without a clawback for existing shareholders.
The issue was lead-managed by Credit Suisse First Boston and a syndicate of
just four banks - Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Goldman Sachs, NM Rothschild and
Salomon Brothers.
The five banks will share fees of Pounds 12.5m. However, they took on a
substantial risk since the issue was a bought deal with the terms fixed
before launch.

FT  17 APR 91 / BSN and Nestle agree to Czech food joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NESTLE, the world's biggest food company and BSN, the leading French food
group, have joined forces with the intention of taking a majority stake in
Czechoslovakia's biggest food producer.
The pair, normally fierce rivals in Europe, have signed a letter of intent
with state-owned Cokoladovny. BSN expects to receive a decision from the
Prague government in July, after privatisation laws come into force.
This is the latest in a series of alliances in the world food industry and,
if successful, would be a rare Western acquisition of majority control of
large eastern European company.
It would be a fillip to French industry, following the wave of
self-criticism provoked last year by Renault's failure to beat Volkswagen in
the contest for a large minority stake in Skoda, the Czech car maker.
Cokoladovny employs 8,000 people in 15 plants across Czecholosvakia and last
year reported a turnover of Kcs4.3bn (Pounds 84.3m)on which BSN believes it
made a profit.
The Czech group produced 42,000 tonnes of chocolate in 1990, around the same
as Nestle did in Switzerland. It made 67,000 tonnes of biscuits, the
equivalent of the French production of Lu, BSN's main biscuit brand  -
representing a large slice of the 400,000-tonne eastern European biscuit
market.
On top of this, it produced 38,000 tonnes of sweets and 20,000 tonnes of
miscellaneous products, including cocoa, nougat, soya and soft drinks.
BSN, leader of the partnership, aims to act as a helpful adviser to
Cokoladovny rather than take full management control, said officials. The
aim is to bring technology, commercial, marketing, and financial help to
strengthen Cokoladovny's position on its home market, said a BSN official.
BSN, Europe's leading biscuit producer, and Nestle, Europe's top chocolate
supplier, decided to co-operate when they discovered they were separately
negotiating for a stake in Cokoladovny, said a Nestle spokesman. 'With our
expertise in chocolate and BSN's in biscuits, we felt that by getting
together we could make a more serious offer to our Czech partners,' he said.
If the Czech government clears the deal, the pair aim to form an equally
owned holding company to take a majority of Cokoladovny, with the rest held
by local investors. Full details, including the value and exact size of the
stake, have yet to be worked out.
BSN has followed a steady strategy of expanding in eastern Europe and Asia.
Last week, it announced the creation of a joint venture with Benesov, a
Czech dairy to make the French group's Danone yoghurt there. Earlier this
year, BSN bought Hagenow dairy in eastern Germany and completed a joint
dairy venture in Hungary.

FT  17 APR 91 / Citicorp falls 70% in quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP earnings plunged 70 per cent in the first quarter, hard hit by the
slowdown in the world economy and the slump in the US property market. North
America's biggest banking group was forced to increase loan-loss reserves by
Dollars 200m (Pounds 113m).
Citicorp yesterday reported earnings of Dollars 70m, or 10 cents a share,
down from Dollars 231m, or 60 cents a share, in the first quarter of last
year. However, taking in changes in accounting practices, after-tax profits
for the first quarter of last year would have been even higher at Dollars
371m.
Mr John Reed, Citicorp's chairman, told a lively and unusually crowded
annual meeting in New York yesterday that business conditions were still
deteriorating. 'We will feel pressure in terms of revenue and credit on both
the consumer and corporate business as this slowdown continues,' he said.
Although an economic revival in the US may start later this year, Mr Reed
cautioned that 'there is little evidence of this now, nor is there reason to
expect a robust recovery'.
Analysts said the latest results were much as expected. Mr Jim Hanbury at
Wertheim Schroder said: 'The deterioration is continuing, but at least
they're putting up some reserves against it.'
Citicorp's interest income and operating expenses were virtually unchanged
from a year ago. Fee and commission revenues edged up by 4 per cent, and
income tax provisions were down by almost a third.
But these positive factors were wiped out by a jump in loan-loss provisions
from Dollars 570m to Dollars 812m. The increase includes an extra Dollars
200m in reserves, divided almost equally between consumer and corporate
business.
Net write-offs fell from Dollars 679m to Dollars 646m, but this was entirely
due to lower losses on Third World loans. Write-offs on consumer loans
climbed by 27 per cent, and on corporate business by 33 per cent.
Non-performing commercial loans rose to Dollars 10.6bn on March 31, from
just under Dollars 10bn three months earlier and Dollars 7.9bn a year ago.
The bank's portfolio of foreclosed properties climbed to almost Dollars 2bn,
from Dollars 1.8bn last December and Dollars 624m a year ago.
Citicorp cut its quarterly dividend earlier this year from 44.5 cents to 25
cents, but Mr Reed said that, despite continuing pressure on earnings, he
does not expect a further dividend reduction.

FT  17 APR 91 / UK insurer to sell reinsurance arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECTIVE sale by Royal Insurance of its 80 per cent stake in its
Royal Re reinsurance subsidiary is expected to earn around Pounds 100m for
the company, according to insurance analysts.
The deal, which has been agreed in principle by Royal and General Re, the
biggest reinsurer based in the US, was announced in London late on Monday. A
price of Pounds 100m would be equivalent to roughly 1.5 times Royal Re's net
asset value.
The disposal would mark a further stage in the withdrawal of UK insurers
from their involvement in reinsurance.
Following the sale by Legal &amp; General of Victory Re last July, Royal Re,
with net written premiums of Pounds 153m, was the second biggest UK
reinsurer outside the Lloyd's market. Mercantile and General Re is the
biggest reinsurer, but its owners, the Prudential Corporation, are also
believed to be seeking a buyer.
The disposal is one of the first results of a strategic review by Royal
Insurance of its worldwide operations begun in early 1991.
Although Royal Re is a specialist in engineering and industrial risk
reinsurance, it has decided that it is too small to compete with the giants
of European reinsurance in a sector where size is increasingly important.
Royal had examined a number of options including geographical
diversification and acquisition but decided the potential return on capital
did not warrant the investment required.
In addition, Royal believes that by offering reinsurance cover it may be
helping to subsidise companies who are competing with it for direct
business.
Royal also said insurance prices were depressed in both the primary and
reinsurance markets.
Royal is expected to announce today the appointment of Mr Richard Gamble,
the finance director who was appointed in 1989, to lead the management group
which is conducting the strategic review.

FT  17 APR 91 / Laidlaw and ADT reach agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC feuding at ADT, the security and car auctions group, ended yesterday
when Laidlaw, its largest shareholder, withdrew its litigation alleging
fraud in return for a board-room shake-up and the establishment of an
independent audit committee.
The agreement gives the Canadian waste-management company four seats on an
expanded ADT board and allows for four independent board members to review
the allegations Laidlaw made in its New York case on April 1.
In a joint statement from New York, Mr Donald Jackson and Mr Michael
Ashcroft, the chief executives of Laidlaw and ADT respectively, welcomed the
agreement as an opportunity to work together for the benefit of
shareholders. ADT's share price, which fell to a low of 64p in London
earlier this month from almost 200p a year ago, rose following the
announcement in New York where it is quoted on NASDAQ.
The agreement brings to an end the public phase of the board-room struggle
that began when Laidlaw alleged in a New York court that ADT and some
directors had manipulated its share price by manufacturing an illusory
profit stream through asset transactions.
Mr Peter Widdrington, non-executive chairman of Laidlaw, said the
establishment of an audit committee met in full the company's worries about
the corporate governance of ADT.
'You have a consideration of getting on with the business at hand while not
whitewashing the issues,' he said.
The agreement, which is encapsulated in a contract, specifies that ADT is to
allow Mr William Stinson, chairman and chief executive of Canadian Pacific
to join ADT's board. Canadian Pacific has a controlling interest in Laidlaw
which has seen the book value of its ADT investment fall Dollars 450m over a
year.
Three Laidlaw directors willjoin the ADT board immediately, ahead of an
annual general meeting on June 3 in Bermuda, where ADT is registered. Until
yesterday's agreement Laidlaw had no board representation despite having a
28.4 per cent stake.
The agreement calls for an application to be made to the New York Stock
Exchange for a full listing.
The audit commitee will be able to look at whether ADT fairly represented
and reported past transactions and whether they accord with UK accounting
standards.

FT  17 APR 91 / Maxwell flotation target put at Pounds 250m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robert Maxwell, the publisher, will today launch the flotation of 49 per
cent of Mirror Group Newspapers - a flotation designed to raise in the
region of Pounds 250m.
Mr Maxwell will unveil a tabloid-sized prospectus and the flotation will be
promoted with advertisements in the press and a television campaign from
Monday featuring the Daily Mirror's famous cartoon character Andy Capp.
The hoped-for valuation of more than Pounds 500m compares with the Pounds
113m purchase price paid to Reed International in 1984, although since then
there have been fundamental modernisation programmes including the
installation of colour presses and inserting equipment.
The company is expected to unveil operating profits of around Pounds 80m a
year and a last-quarter performance up on last year, a significant
achievement given the depth of the current advertising recession.
One third of the shares will be set aside for UK institutions, one third for
overseas institutions and the remainder for British small investors.
Mr Maxwell's recent purchase of the loss-making New York Daily News, which
will not be included in the flotation, is expected to heighten interest in
the shares in the US.
The company will be floated as a 'pure publishing company' without property
but with MGN's main popular titles at its heart - the Daily Mirror, the
Sunday Mirror, The People, the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail and the
Sporting Life. It will also include the newspapers' colour presses.
The so-called pathfinder prospectus will form the basis on which the shares
will be marketed to institutions over the next few weeks. It will include
all financial details on the company except the share price, which is
scheduled to be announced on April 30.
The Stock Exchange blocked plans to give MGN readers priority in the
flotation but the minimum investment figure is being set at the relatively
low figure of around Pounds 250 to encourage readers of the papers and other
members of the public. The shares will not be partly-paid.
The MGN flotation marks the first opportunity for the public to buy shares
in a new issue for a company - outside the government's privatisation of the
electricity industry - for about a year.

FT  17 APR 91 / Warsaw exchange opens with bubbly and braces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ADVICE came from France but the bubbly was Californian, and the Polish
brokers wore bright red braces supplied by consultants Arthur Andersen as
Warsaw yesterday re-opened its stock exchange after 50 years.
To underline the point that capitalism is back in favour in Poland, the
exchange is housed in the monolithic building which used to be home to the
Polish communist party central committee.
The volume of trading in shares of the first five recently privatised
companies to come to the market was modest to say the least. But the
assembled officials, putative capitalists and confused onlookers appeared
relieved that a start had at last been made.
Even more relieved no doubt were the 100,000 or so shareholders who invested
in the first public offer last autumn. They finally learned that the value
of their original investment had grown by between 10 per cent and 60 per
cent.
Mr Janusz Lewandowski, privatisation minister, welcomed the opening of an
institution which he said provided 'the most subtle form of contact between
supply and demand'.
The first five quoted companies were all privatised along UK lines with
intensive help from British merchant banks, accountants and lawyers and
finance from the British government's 'knowhow fund'.
Future privatisation is likely to take place on much less structured lines.
Mr Lewandowski, one of a team of private enterprise-oriented technocrats in
the government headed by Mr Jan Bielecki, the prime minister, is co-author
of a mass privatisation scheme effected through vouchers and unit trusts.
This is designed to speed up the transfer of state assets to private
ownership. With thousands of companies to be liquidated and privatised,
flotations such as those used for UK privatisations are seen as too slow and
expensive.
The exchange will operate only once a week until June. It is based on the
French model where offers to buy and sell are matched to fix a price without
any active market - making by brokers. It is modelled on the Lyons bourse
and Poles have been advised by the French Societe des Bourses and Eurogroup
Consultants.
The matching of offers gave Exbud, the Kielce-based construction company,
the best result with a 33 per cent rise on its original price of Zl 112,000
(Pounds 6.58), although a mere 10 shares were actually bought and sold.
The Krosno glass works, whose exports have been hit by the zloty's
appreciation against the dollar and other hard currencies over the past 15
months of fixed exchange rates, showed the poorest performance. It fell 8.5
per cent from its original price of Zl 65,000 on offers to sell 17 shares
and buy six.
Even in Krosno's case, yesterday's price gave a 10 per cent nominal profit
to shareholders who in most cases bought shares with government
privatisation bonds which allowed buyers a 20 per cent discount on the
purchase price.
The next two companies to be sold through a public share offer will be
Swarzedz, a furniture manufacturer from Poznan, and Wolczanka, a textile
producer. The government has told the International Monetary Fund that it
plans to sell the shares of between 40 and 50 companies this year.

FT  17 APR 91 / Labour drops N-arms stand: Draft election manifesto marks
final phase of shift to centre ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL Kinnock abandoned the last vestiges of his party's support for
unilateral nuclear disarmament yesterday as Labour launched its draft
manifesto for the general election.
The shift, designed to defuse defence as an issue in the election campaign,
came at the launch of a 27,000-word policy document promising to combine
economic prudence with a comprehensive programme to 'modernise' Britain.
The Labour document, entitled 'Opportunity Britain' to emphasise its claim
to what is becoming the political slogan of the 1990s, marks the final stage
in the party's shift into the centre-ground of politics.
In an attempt to refute Conservative charges that Labour would negotiate
away Britain's deterrent in return for a fraction of the Soviet nuclear
force, Mr Kinnock said: 'We have at no stage . . . made a commitment to
getting rid of all nuclear weapons for as long as others have them'.
A commitment to revolutionise education and training is put at the heart of
a strategy which Mr Kinnock said would provide a 'commonsense lead into a
better future'.
The document stresses that Labour's spending plans - from those on education
and the NHS to those needed to meet pledges to encourage industrial
investment - will be met only when economic growth permits. Mr Kinnock said
those on average earnings would not be hit by Labour's intention to raise
the ceiling on National Insurance contributions and to increase the top rate
of tax to 50 per cent.
Labour also set out in detail its plan for a radical restructuring of
government decisions on public spending and taxation. In an attempt to
prevent a pay explosion wrecking its plans for increased investment in
industry and in education and the health service, it plans to wrap public
spending decisions into the annual Budget.
This will follow a 'National Economic Assessment' when employers and unions
will be invited to assess what the country can 'afford' - implying that
excessive awards would trigger tough decisions on tax and public spending.

FT  17 APR 91 / Gorbachev to reduce Far East forces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE SOVIET military presence in the Asia-Pacific region is to be cut,
President Mikhail Gorbachev will tell the Japanese parliament today.
He will also call for a five-nation Pacific conference on security and
co-operation and a zone of co-operation in north-east Asia, around the rim
of the Sea of Japan. The call is aimed particularly at the US, which has
military bases in the Pacific, including Subic Bay in the Philippines and
Okinawa in Japan.
Moscow has been reducing its forces on the Chinese border and lowering its
presence in the area but maintains naval bases in the Pacific and Indian
Ocean area.
The principal base for its Pacific fleet of surface ships, submarines and
aircraft is at Vladivostok. Its other bases are at Petropavlovsk, Magadan
and Sovetskaya Gavan in the Soviet Far East. The Soviet navy also has repair
and other facilities at Cam Ranh bay, the former US base in Vietnam.
Mr Gorbachev's move is set in the context of a proposal, which he has
previously foreshadowed, for a conference in 1993 of the foreign ministers
of China, India, Japan, the Soviet Union and the US as a first step towards
creating an organisation of multilateral consultations on security and
economic co-operation.
Neither Japan nor the US is likely to see the proposals as substantial
unless agreement is also reached on the future ownership of the disputed
Kurile islands, which has plagued relations between Tokyo and Moscow. The US
supports Japan's claim to the four islands, seized by the Soviet Union in
1945.
Parts of the speech echo earlier calls for detente in Asia by Mr Gorbachev
during past visits to the Soviet Far East. The US and Japan and other Asian
countries were disappointed then that his remarks were not followed by
decisive Soviet military cuts.
The burden of Mr Gorbachev's speech, parts of which were leaked to Japanese
media last night, was confirmed by a spokesman for the Soviet delegation in
Tokyo. The speech, to parliamentarians in the Japanese diet, will come
during a second day of talks with Mr Toshiki Kaifu, Japan's prime minister.

FT  17 APR 91 / Exchange controls removed by Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN last night removed the last of its controls on capital leaving the
country, in an effort to relieve pressure on its overvalued currency before
further interest rate cuts become inevitable.
The move follows an attack on Spanish monetary policy last weekend by Mr
Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, who called the peseta's
strength in the European Monetary System 'an unexpected phenomenon, even
against nature'.
The franc is sitting at the bottom of its permitted trading range against
the peseta in the ERM, but Paris needs to cut interest rates to help revive
its flagging economy.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, said in London that the
government had decided to allow Spanish residents to hold foreign currency
accounts with banks licensed in Spain. He described the reform, which comes
into effect this week, as 'transcendental' and 'an absolute innovation in
our monetary history.'
Analysts in Madrid said the move could lead to significant outflows of
funds.
The City of London was far from convinced that the deregulation would reduce
upward pressure on the peseta. Mr Jonathan Hoffman, senior European
economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in London, pointed out that such
exchange control relaxation had often been counter-productive in other
countries 'because it simply boosts the confidence of foreigners in the
currency'.
Mr Solchaga also said a second control, limiting loans by Spanish banks to
non-residents to 50 per cent of their convertible peseta deposits, would be
completely lifted.
The measures mean Spain has largely met its promise last year to remove all
capital controls well before its deadline at the end of next year.
The only remaining control forces residents to seek authorisation for any
foreign loan of more than Pta 1.5bn (Pounds 8.13m) for three years or less.
It is used by the authorities to restrict short-term inflows of money. That,
said Mr Pedro Perez, Mr Solchaga's deputy. 'can comfortably be lifted in the
next 18 months'.
Madrid remains in a tight corner. Mr Solchaga has been warning that
inflation has not been beaten and that the time is not right for another
interest rate cut to follow the one made a month ago when the Bank of Spain
cut its official intervention rate a full point to 13.5 per cent.
Although both the February and March consumer prices figures have held
annualised inflation to 5.9 per cent, first quarter figures published this
week show private sector credit and the broad money measure supply growing
21.5 per cent and 16 per cent respectively - more than double their targets.
Faced with this, the Bank of Spain refused on Monday to cut its intervention
rate.
Nevertheless, the Spanish authorities' dilemma is winning little sympathy
from Paris, where Mr Beregovoy warned that current tension in the exchange
rate mechanism of the EMS could only be explained by the fact that the Bank
of Spain's money market rate was 13.5 per cent for an inflation rate of
nearly 6 per cent.

FT  17 APR 91 / Foreign Affairs: Price of rapprochement - Japan could try to
buy the Kurile islands but Mr Gorbachev may not be in a position to sell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since the Dutch paid the Indians Dollars 24 to buy Manhattan, it has
been getting more expensive to acquire territory occupied by somebody else.
In 1803 Thomas Jefferson paid Dollars 27,267,622 to the French in the
Louisiana Purchase because he wanted the port of New Orleans. Admittedly
Alaska, for which the Tsar accepted a measly Dollars 7,200,000 from the US
in 1867, was, in retrospect, a bit of a bargain, but the Russian monarch was
keen to sell.
This week, according to some reports, Japan may offer about Dollars
26,000,000,000 in order to get back four tiny islands with minimal
commercial and questionable strategic value, occupied by the Soviet Union
since 1945. Even then, all these extra zeroes may not be enough, for it is
far from clear that President Mikhail Gorbachev, on his 'historic' visit to
Tokyo, is in a position to sell, even though, heaven knows, his country
needs the money.
Soviet-Japanese relations are indeed one of the more curious anomalies of
the present day. There are historical and contemporary reasons for this,
starting even before the Meiji restoration in the 1860s and running through
the Cold War to the present. What they seem to amount to is an almost
inherent mutual nervousness and suspicion, compounded by intermittent
political paralysis in both nations and watched over, with acute interest,
by the US itself.
Though Japan and Russia hardly intruded on their consciousness, both George
Washington and Thomas Jefferson had things to say which, taken out of
context, have a certain resonance to the current relationship between Tokyo
and Moscow. Washington, for example, pronounced in his farewell address that
the 'great rule (in regard to foreign nations) is, in extending our
commercial relations to have as little political connection as possible'.
This advice is the perfect description of modern Japanese external policies,
except that it only applies in part to the Soviet Union. Even though they
are neighbours, even though Siberia's riches ought to attract resource-poor
Japan and the vast Soviet population be a magnet for Japanese consumer
goods, Japan's trade with the Soviet Union has never amounted to much more
than 2 per cent of its total foreign trade. Political exchanges, however,
have conformed to Washington's dictum.
Jefferson once said that if trade were freed of its shackles, 'the greatest
mass possible would then be produced of those things which contribute to
human life and human happiness'. Modern mercantilist Japan would subscribe
to the principle, but has hardly begun to practise it with the Soviet Union,
where human happiness has not been a natural state. This stands in sharp
contrast with the approach to China, with which Japan has a complex and
ambivalent relationship but which it sees as a bulwark against the Soviet
bear and therefore more worthy of commercial cultivation, with three times
the Soviet volume of trade.
Of course, Japan and the Soviet Union now constitute an almost classic
mismatch. As Gerald Segal points out in a Chatham House paper* released this
week, 'the basis for this . . . is the geopolitics of north-east Asia, where
a thinly populated Soviet superpower faces a densely populated Japan which
cannot defend itself. Yet Japan has emerged as an economic superpower while
the Soviet economy stagnates and thrashes about for a suitable policy for
reform'.
Neither Mr Segal nor Dr Wolf Mendl, in his more cogently argued contribution
to a new book, The International Relations of Japan,** believes that
settling the territorial dispute would necessarily instantly transform the
relationship. This, Dr Mendl argues, may only be attainable within the
context of a broader north-east Asian co-operation, covering economic,
security and environmental issues. But even then, he concludes 'it will take
time'.
In his more creative moments, Mr Gorbachev has allowed himself to
contemplate such a brave new Asian world. Ever since he assumed power the
style of contacts with Japan has improved, from his initial appointment of a
new professional Soviet ambassador to Tokyo through to his visit on Monday
to Japanese war graves in Khabarovsk. The Soviet rapprochement with South
Korea is a move in the same direction, as would be the establishment of a
new regional arms control regime, a blueprint of which he promises to unveil
in Tokyo today.
But this is still in the theoretical stage and must be set against powerful
countervailing forces in the Soviet Union. The Kuriles are part of the
Russian federation and Mr Boris Yeltsin is not exactly keen on having his
great rival sign them away, regardless of the price. Nor is the Soviet
military persuaded that they are militarily without value. Nor are the Start
negotiations with the US, a necessary precursor of any new Asian regime, now
going well.
Thus it can have come as no great surprise that Mr Gorbachev declared in
Khabarovsk on Monday that 'we are not going to use territory or policy as an
instrument to make deals'. He may have no greater freedom or inclination
than to acknowledge that at least the territorial problem exists, which the
Japanese claim was conceded in part in 1956, but never since.
Equally, in Tokyo, there is no great inclination to settle for half a loaf -
that is, the return, for now, of two of the four islands and unspecified
future commitments. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, who resigned last week as
secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, did go to Moscow
to explore the Soviet intent. But the process of selling an agreement of any
sort to the Japanese public, which has been conditioned to settle for
nothing less than resumed sovereignty of all the islands, has not even
begun.
Indeed, there is even apparent a new steel in Japan's external policies, at
least where money is concerned. Over the past week, Japan has said, first,
that its aid contributions will take into consideration the amount the
recipient country spends on defence (a wholly laudable statement); second,
it has taken exception to debt forgiveness for Egypt and Poland, apparently
because it does not necessarily share the political judgment behind these
US-led proposals.
This sounds like the Ministry of Finance asserting itself domestically, as
it liked to during the whole debate over Japan's contributions to the Gulf
effort. Neither pronouncement is necessarily the last policy word, since
both involve conflict with the US. But if both are taken even at a discount
from face value, the Soviet Union cannot expect to be receiving any Japanese
blank cheques.
Still, the US could serve as broker to a Soviet-Japanese settlement. Wolf
Mendl points out that since the origins of the territorial dispute lie in
Soviet-American relations during and after the last war the US may have 'a
moral responsibility to work for a resolution', which is a fair point. But
any mediation would have to be 'indirect'. If it is taking place at all, it
certainly is not a visible part of President Bush's 'New World Order'.
With the benefit of hindsight, there probably was an open window of
opportunity for a territorial settlement about two years ago. Then Mr
Gorbachev might have been able to deliver domestically, Japan might have
been pushed to turn him down, and the US might not have objected. And the
Soviet Union would have been enriched by more than the Indians got from the
Dutch, though looking at the state of Manhattan today they were probably
wise to sell.

FT  17 APR 91 / Arts: Sir David Lean - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's most celebrated film director, Sir David Lean, died in London
yesterday after a long illness.
Sir David, 83, whose screen triumphs included Lawrence of Arabia, The Bridge
On The River Kwai and Dr Zhivago, was taken ill earlier this year while
working on a Pounds 23m project in Europe. He was flown home from the south
of France for treatment but never recovered, his lawyer Mr Tony Reeves
announced. A private funeral will be held and a memorial service is to be
arranged.
Sir David, who married for the fifth time in December last year to Sandra
Cooke, had just completed work on the script of his adaptation of Joseph
Conrad's Nostromo. Its future is now in doubt.
Sir David's films won a total of 26 Oscars, making him one of the most
successful directors despite long periods of inactivity.
After learning his trade in the 1920s as a clapperboard boy and a 'wardrobe
mistress' he took charge of editing and commentary for Gaumont Sound News in
1930 - later moving to British Movietone News.
Within a few years he was Britain's highest-paid film editor, working on
successes like French Without Tears, Pygmalion and 49th Parallel.
He was invited to co-direct with Noel Coward the story of wartime life in
the Royal Navy, In Which We Serve. Its success in 1942 led him to direct
three other films written by Coward - This Happy Breed, Blithe Spirit, and
the widely acclaimed Brief Encounter - by 1946.
The early post-war years saw the critical and box office successes Great
Expectations, still regarded by many as his finest achievement, and Oliver
Twist.
His Dr Zhivago in 1965 was to earn more money than all his other films put
together. Another of his box office successes was Ryan's Daughter in 1970.
He was upset by the cool critical response the film received and did not
make another until A Passage To India in 1984.
But recognition of his achievements continued. In 1973 he received the
Directors Guild of America's highest accolade, the D W Griffith Award.
In 1983, the year before he was knighted, he was given one of the first
fellowships awarded by the British Film Institute.

FT  17 APR 91 / Loss-making pitfalls lurk in computer technology: Ian
Hamilton Fazey looks at a campaign for better security which will intensify
today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUILDERS' merchant turned from healthy profit to loss a year after
computerising its stock controls. With no discrepancy between revenue and
sales, the truth emerged too late to save the business.
The storeman in charge of the trade counter had found he could, when induced
by a bribe, key in low prices for cash sales without anyone noticing,
provided he restored the original prices immediately. As the computer always
matched goods and cash correctly at the instant of sale, no discrepancy was
evident.
Mr Chris Hook, of the National Computer Centre, explains: 'There was no bar
on anyone getting into the software, the computer was not programmed to log
price alterations and there was no audit trail for tracing what had
happened.'
Neither had the management considered using the computer to generate
management accounts. Such a step would have revealed the fraud by showing
poor cash yields for stock being sold at a 'discount'.
Mr Hook runs the NCC's Information Technology Security Awareness Programme
for Business, a Pounds 400,000 campaign paid for by the Department of Trade
and Industry. It is aimed at medium-sized and smaller businesses, but a
measure of general need is that 40 per cent of the 4,500 companies
registered with the NCC for future advice are big.
The campaign has distributed 14,000 free information packs and registration
forms - 4,000 more than it budgeted for. More will go out today, as part of
Crime Prevention Week, from business crime prevention exhibitions in
Bradford, Nottingham and Trafford Park.
Companies registering with the NCC are to be offered a Pounds 95 pack
comprising a manual, a video made by Esso to improve computer security, and
an interactive disk to enable managers to work out risks on their PCs.
Packs will be sold abroad and to non-registered UK businesses at about
Pounds 750 each, with profits ploughed back into the campaign with the aim
of making it self-supporting.
With theft of computers a growing crime, police want all businesses to
improve security, but Mr Hook says loss of data is nearly always more
crippling than theft of hardware.
The NCC was recently called to a pharmaceuticals company where a senior
manager returning from three days' leave found all his PC's files corrupted
by a virus.
Staff had seen a well-dressed, polite stranger sitting at the keyboard the
day before. A personal password to block access to his machine would have
prevented the sabotage.
'If visitors have to sign in, you or a colleague should take them back to
the front door at the end of the visit and witness their checking out,' says
Mr Hook.
Companies also need a policy for the aftermath of disasters, with trained,
authorised staff controlling access during, say, the clear-up after a fire
or robbery, when open doors make further theft a possibility.
In addition, the NCC advises that care should be taken in disposing of old
computer disks and tapes, as most 'delete' commands remove only the first
letter of a file name.
One US company bought old disks and tapes 'for recycling' from
environmentally conscious businesses. It then extracted whatever data -
supposedly deleted - that it found on them and sold them to competitors.
Only honesty between rivals exposed the trade.

FT  17 APR 91 / Old Masters extend their allure: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT has always been a disappointment to western antique dealers that they
could rarely interest the Japanese in Old Master paintings. The iconography
was outside their experience.
That seems to be changing, judging by the Pounds 110,000 paid by a Japanese
private collector at Phillips yesterday for The Bird Trap by Pieter Brueghel
the Younger. It shows Flemish peasants of about 1600 skating.
It was the highest price in an Old Master auction which did reasonably well,
bringing in Pounds 769,725 with 25 per cent unsold. A scene of peasants at a
roadside shrine, attributed to Cimaroli, went for Pounds 66,000, against a
Pounds 15,000 top estimate, and an Italian private collector gave Pounds
60,500 for a pair of Roman views by the 18th-century local artist Paolo
Anesi.
Christie's achieved an impressive price of Pounds 143,000 for an early
18th-century German house altar by Thelot. It had been estimated that it
would sell for around Pounds 25,000.
That was compensation for the failure of two important lots to find buyers -
a bronze bust of the fourth Earl of Chesterfield cast from a model by
Roubiliac was unsold at Pounds 90,000, and a micro-mosaic of the head of
Bacchus, produced in Rome around 1800 in imitation of the antique, was
bought in at Pounds 25,000.
A group of four Limoges enamels, produced about 1535 by the Aeneid Master,
showing scenes from Virgil's chronicle, went within forecast for Pounds
55,000, and a Franconian wood relief of Christ on a donkey, carved about
1500, sold for Pounds 52,800. The sale of European sculpture and works of
art totalled Pounds 522,555.
Also at Christie's, Old Master drawings brought in Pounds 385,495.

FT  17 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): NatWest to impose 7.5% pay increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank told its 80,000 UK staff yesterday that it was
introducing measures that will give pay rises of 7.5 per cent and allow the
bank to require more flexible starting times from employees.
The measures are being adopted in spite of strong opposition from Bifu, the
financial services union, which is organising a strike ballot in pursuit of
an improved offer.
NatWest said it had decided to go ahead after members of the NatWest Staff
Association voted in favour of acceptance. Its decision follows an offer by
Lloyds Bank to raise staff salaries by only 5 per cent. The Lloyds and
NatWest increases were due to operate from April 1.
Barclays Bank, the first of the big four clearing banks to settle on pay
this year, agreed a package worth more than 7 per cent over the full year.
NatWest said 70 senior executives would receive no cost-of-living rise this
year, although they would be eligible for performance pay rises.
Bifu is opposing the deal because of the level of rises and the increased
flexibility it requires on hours.
The bank says it needs to vary starting times between 8am and 10am to
provide a better service. It recently announced extended opening hours.
Unions representing 50,000 professional and technical workers in the
National Health Service, including medical laboratory staff and technicians,
were yesterday offered a 7.9 per cent pay rise or Pounds 11.50 a week,
whichever is the larger.
Unions including MSF, the general technical union, have until May 17 to
respond. The proposed increase is the same as that offered to ambulance
staff and NHS administrative and clerical workers.
Ancillary workers have been offered a more complex package that would add
8.8 per cent to their pay bill at the end of the year.

FT  17 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Threat to form N Sea breakaway union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OUR LABOUR EDITOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of unofficial industrial action in the North Sea threatened
yesterday to establish a breakaway union unless existing unions created a
new joint offshore body. The move came as the unions tried to negotiate a
pay deal for construction workers.
The Offshore Industry Liaison Committee called on existing unions to alter
the way they represent offshore workers. The committee said moves towards a
new union would be 'inescapable' if they refused.
The dispute was provoked by negotiations between construction unions and the
Offshore Contractors' Council (OCC) on a new recognition agreement covering
'hook-up' work on construction of rigs, but excluding the 'post hook-up'
phase of maintenance of rigs.
The OCC said after talks yesterday that there had been significant progress
in some areas with a 'hook-up' agreement under negotiation. A joint panel
was also being established to look at any outstanding grievances over men
dismissed during the unofficial strikes.
The talks came after unions failed to persuade enough offshore workers to
register for a ballot on industrial action to force a single agreement
covering all 20,000 workers in various offshore occupations.
Mr Ronnie McDonald, chairman of the committee, said that unless the unions
established a joint offshore section - empowered with a certificate of
independence as a separate union and the freedom to decide its own policies
 -moves towards a breakaway union were likely.
He said that if unions refused to set up such a section, 'they will have
declared unilaterally the North Sea a no-go area for them'. Offshore workers
would then be likely to 'seek their own solutions' to the industrial
relations process.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, executive councillor of the AEU Engineering union, said
after talks with employers that 'significant progress' had been made on
reaching a recognition agreement for rig construction work. He said the
agreement would be the most comprehensive deal ever to cover North Sea
workers.
Employers and unions also agreed to establish a joint panel to consider the
cases of up to 460 workers who - unions claim - have been prevented from
working in the North Sea after taking part in industrial action last year.

FT  17 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Scottish TUC rejects incomes policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS yesterday reinforced their opposition to wage restraint under a
Labour government amid controversy over whether Labour's proposed national
economic assessment (NEA) would amount to an incomes policy.
Unions voted nearly unanimously at the Scottish Trades Union Congress to
reject 'incomes policy in whatever shape or guise it may be advocated', but
to support Labour's policy review, which advocates an annual economic
assessment involving unions along with employers and the government.
Labour has specifically rejected an incomes policy, but some unions fear
union particpation in the NEA may lead to the introduction of wage
restraint.
Yesterday, Usdaw, the shop workers' union, was the only union not to support
the motion, on the ground that a national minimum wage under a Labour
government would be a form of incomes policy that would help low-paid
workers across the economy.
Open conflict was avoided when the UCW communication workers' union agreed
not to force a vote on a separate motion calling for synchronisation of pay
bargaining.
The vote followed controversy on the issue last week, when leaders of the
AEU engineering union said Labour's plans for a national economic assessment
were unsatisfactory as they stood, because they could interfere with
collective bargaining.
The unity at the STUC was established after negotiations between unions on
the form of the motion opposing wage restraint.
Before agreeing with the STUC general council not to force a vote on the UCW
motion, Mr Alan Tuffin, the union's leader, said that he wanted to 'lay the
ghost to rest that somehow this is a recipe for incomes policy or wage
restraint'.
He said that, if unions were not willing to discuss pay as part of a
national economic assessment, their calls for new policies, such as
increased spending on training by Labour, would amount to a list of demands
that were 'undeliverable', and would lead to disillusion.
Mr Ron Todd, TGWU general secretary, said his union would oppose any form of
incomes policy. However, he said that unions should stop 'looking under
stones for things that are not there' by associating an economic assessment
with wage restraint.
Mr Garfield Davies, Usdaw general secretary, said a national minimum wage
would amount to a helpful form of incomes policy.

<TEXT>
THE ISLE of Man government yesterday presented to Tynwald, the island's
parliament, a Budget designed to spread the benefits from the island's
thriving economy among less well-off residents and increase aid for business
ahead of the island's autumn general election.
The island, a crown dependency, has its own parliament and manages its own
financial arrangements, including setting its level of taxation.
The Manx government will give an initial allowance of 100 per cent on new
capital expenditure for industrial, tourist and agricultural buildings.
Mr Donald Gelling, the Manx treasury minister, said he wanted to assist
business, while 'seeking to ensure adequate funding for the provision of
enhanced public services and for assistance to the less well-off'.

FT  17 APR 91 / Hussey reappointed as BBC chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Marmaduke Hussey has been reappointed chairman of the BBC for a second
five-year term from November. It is the first time that a BBC chairman has
been reappointed for a second full term.
Mr Hussey, aged 67, former chief executive and managing director of Times
Newspapers, will lead the BBC up to the renegotiation of its Royal Charter
in 1996.
Lord Barnett, also 67, vice-chairman of the BBC and a former Labour cabinet
minister, has been reappointed for a further two years.
In making the appointments, the government has opted for stability while the
purpose and structure of the corporation, and the licence fee that funds it,
will come under detailed scrutiny. They imply confidence in the main BBC
policies pursued over the past five years.
Mr Hussey's reappointment makes it more likely that Mr Michael Checkland,
the BBC director general will stay on to see in the new charter.
The BBC chairman receives a salary of Pounds 50,365 on the basis of working
four days a week.

FT  17 APR 91 / School tours operation emerges in new guise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADVENTURE Travel Inter-national, the school tours operator that ceased
trading just before Easter, has emerged in a new guise, employing the same
staff. School Life, the new concern, is approaching schools that had booked
holidays with ATI, offering to provide the same or similar trips.
School Life says the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) and ATI's
administrative receivers have approved its approach to schools. Both parties
deny the claim.
ATI, based in Shipley, West Yorkshire, is one of several school operators
that have collapsed since February. Its failure and that of Sun Living, a
competitor in Lancing, East Sussex, have created a financial crisis for
Abta, which faces a Pounds 3.5m bill to bail out the two companies'
customers.
Ms Celia Ryan, School Life's coach sales co-ordinator, was fielding
inquiries yesterday on the Leicester number that schools were told to
contact. She said: 'We have Abta's approval and the liquidator's approval to
take over all the bookings and the business of ATI.'
One of ATI's receivers, Mr Alan Marlor, of accountants Ernst &amp; Young, said
yesterday: 'That is wrong.' On the contrary, he said, the receivers had sold
the business to Cambridge-based David Winter Travel, an Abta member trading
as School Tours. It will pay the receivers a fee for each holiday re-booked.
Mr David Hurst, Abta's head of public affairs, said: 'We can say absolutely
categorically that School Life is not a member of Abta. We have not heard of
this company. We have not given it permission to take over any business.'
A letter received by one school in Kent says School Life is 'backed by'
Midland Fox, the Leicester-based bus and coach operator. Mr David Martin,
Midland Fox's managing director, described School Life as a trading division
of his company.
Mr Marlor said Midland Fox had made an offer for ATI's business, which had
been rejected as unacceptable.
At School Life, Ms Ryan said: 'We have retained the (ATI) staff because of
their experience in putting together tours.' Asked if that included Mr Nigel
Parker and Mr David Constance - ATI's founders, who sold the company in
January but remained as consultants - she said: 'They're both involved at
the moment, at least until everything is sorted out.'
Package holidays booked through Midland Fox are covered by the Bus and Coach
Council's bond scheme, which Abta recognises but for which it takes no
responsibility.
One school approached by School Life was Sowerby Bridge High School in
Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire. Mr Russell Lawrance, a teacher who helped
organise a trip due in July, said a message from Ms Suzanne Baxter of School
Life was waiting when he returned from Easter holidays on April 8. Ms Baxter
was formerly customer services manager at ATI.
Ms Baxter offered to rearrange the Sowerby Bridge school's trip to France to
a Spanish destination, Mr Lawrance said. After checking with Abta, Mr
Lawrance decided not to do so. He will apply to Abta for a refund of the
Pounds 4,200 deposit lodged with ATI.
At St Simon Stock school in Maidstone, Kent, the approach came from Mr Andy
Ellson, School Life's festivals manager. He was owner and managing director
of Tourland, which arranged coach transport for ATI holidays.
In an undated letter, which Mr Paul Murphy, a teacher, received on Monday,
Mr Ellson offered 'a guaranteed tour as originally arranged by me on behalf
of ATI at the same price and same location with my new organisation, School
Life.'
The School Life brochure counsels schools to apply directly to Abta for
refunds. ATI, an Abta member, blamed its collapse on the organisation's
delay in sending it money due to Sun Living customers who had rebooked with
ATI. Mr John Dunscombe, Abta's president, indicated last week that it would
scrutinise carefully any application for refunds received from non-members.
Mr Murphy said his school would not take up School Life's offer but, like
Sowerby Bridge, would apply to Abta for a refund.
Rank Organisation, the leisure group that owns New World Travel, a school
holidays operator, has acquired the summer booking files of Adventure
Express from its receivers. Adventure Express, based in Chesham,
Buckinghamshire, ceased trading on March 28, the same day as ATI, but is not
related to it.

FT  17 APR 91 / ITV companies ask government to reduce 'severe' levy on
revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Home Office and the Treasury have agreed to examine ITV companies'
claims that they are paying too high a special levy on its revenue and
profits at a time of severe recession in the advertising industry, Raymond
Snoddy writes.
The 15 regional companies of the ITV system collectively paid a Pounds 113m
levy last year on total profits before levy of Pounds 200m. The total profit
after levy of Pounds 87m last year compares with Pounds 228m in 1989 and
Pounds 205m in 1988. The figures do not include TV-am, the commercial
breakfast station.
Under the new levy scheme, which came in at the beginning of last year, the
companies pay 10 per cent of their revenues after deducting their Channel 4
subscriptions and a Pounds 15m 'free slice' on which the levy is not paid.
They also pay 25 per cent of profit after levy and an extra Pounds 2m free
slice.
Sir Brian Bailey, chairman of the ITV Association and of Television South
West, has warned Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, that such a 'severe
tax' on top of normal company taxation could be imposed on an ITV company
operating at a loss.
The special tax regime for commercial television has changed many times over
the years from a revenue tax to a profits tax and back again to a
predominantly revenue-based tax. The ITV companies argue that because of the
advertising recession they experienced nil growth in 1990 over 1989 - a
significant decline in real terms. The new levy changes were drawn up on the
assumption of 6 per cent a year growth in income.
The current estimate for ITV's net advertising revenue for 1991 is Pounds
1.614bn - the second year in a row of no real growth.
When the government announced the levy changes in December 1988, the
intention was to restore the yield to the Treasury to the pre-April 1986
basis.
The ITV companies argue that because of the recession they have ended up
paying significantly more than that.
The present levy system runs until the end of 1992, when it will be replaced
by the sums of money bid in next month's competitive tenders for new
franchises.
The bids, which will go straight to the government, could amount to anything
from Pounds 250m to Pounds 400m a year, depending on the intensity of the
competition.

Steering well clear of the capital - Ivo Dawnay reports from his first port
of call on the campaign trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MORE than 2 1/2 years the political control of Nottingham City Council
has depended on the antique mechanics of a 10-year-old, scarlet Ford Escort.
In that time, its owner - 68-year-old councillor John Peck, DFC - has
successfully waged his campaigns while negotiating uncounted traffic hazards
and the potential pitfalls of holding the balance of power between 27 Labour
and 27 Tory colleagues.
Mr Peck's tireless travelling and exhaustive grassroots activism in Bulwell
ward have earned him his seat, whether as a communist he was, or a Green as
he is today. But what of the others?
Earthquakes permitting, Labour will at last gain the firm control over the
council denied it by two elections in 1983 and 1987 when the Tories were
flying high nationally.
But if the poll tax factor could be stripped out, how then would the parties
lie? On economic grounds, at least, Nottingham appears to be weathering the
recession in surprisingly good health.
The city still has an old fashioned central square, bustling shopping
centres, a diversified business base and a prize-winning polytechnic.
Moneywise Magazine judges it the best city for 'quality of life' in Britain
and, what is more, Nottingham Forest are in the final of the FA Cup.
Its biggest difficulty is now a shortage of land to develop. Local
development needs - a new Light Rapid Transport system and electrification
of the railway line from London St Pancras - enjoy all-party support. So,
too, does the desire to win back to the city the powers granted to the
county council in the 1974 re-organisation.
Penny-pinching London - birthplace of the ruinous poll tax - is widely seen
as the stumbling block. Indeed, one understandably anonymous local
businessman conceded that many of his colleagues were as happy to see Labour
in the magnificent 1929 Council House as the Tories.
'Both lots agree on the main issue of fighting to develop Nottingham,' he
said. 'The headline-grabbing issues are always peripheral.'
That commonly-held view is fiercely contested by the two main parties - both
aware that with three marginal Westminster seats (one Labour, two Tory) at
stake, Nottingham is a weathervane for the general election. To make it more
central still, the city's battles are being fought on propaganda and
ideological territory strongly similar to that mapped-out in national party
headquarters.
In consequence, Mr Bill Bradbury, the no-nonsense Tory leader, concedes that
Labour has so far successfully sold its 'modern' image. But he goes on to
warn of a hidden agenda of irresponsible high-spending and 'loony' leftism
which surfaced once in what he describes as a 'world first' of gay swimming
sessions at city pools.
Mr John Taylor, Labour's bearded deputy leader, counters that his party is
now the champion of 'enabling local government' in partnership with the
private sector, while the Tories inhabit an out-dated Thatcherite past of
ineffective market forces.
Pointing to a number of development schemes for vacant land, he says
constructive intervention in the local economy is the only alternative to
leaving Nottingham's future simply to the ebbs and flows of the national
economy.
Bounce that claim back off councillor Bradbury and he will reply that
several of the projects were actually initiated by the Tories. But how much
does the ordinary voter notice these nuances, or care?
The message from Nottingham is that in many voters' minds there is little to
distinguish between the two parties - a reflection in microcosm, perhaps, of
the national picture.
Both parties are wrestling for the centre ground on platforms of sound
management based on private and public sector partnerships.
With the poll tax fiasco and the Tories' high previous votes, Labour surely
must win outright control. But whether the margin will be adequate to augur
a general election victory is doubtful.
As one neutral city leader put it: 'If interest rates drop to 10 per cent
and inflation is down to five per cent, that is also pretty persuasive.'
Whatever the parties' national computers say on May 3, the 'feel-good'
factor will still play its part when the general election comes.

An all-party committee of MPs found Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, the Labour MP

declare his sponsorship by Cohse, a health service union.
Mr Campbell-Savours said his non-declaration had been on the principle that
the rules requiring him to declare the benefit to his constituency party
from the sponsorship were inconsistent, because they did not require
declaration of similar benefits from other organisations.

THE government's health service reforms, intended to produce an internal
market in which the money follows the patient, are producing hardly any
patient choice, according to a survey conducted by Ms Harriet Harman, an
opposition health spokeswoman.
The replies from just over 70 district health authorities showed that most
of health authority budgets were spent in block contracts between purchasing
health authorities - which do not have direct dealings with patients - and
hospitals providing the services, leaving very little scope for referring
patients for treatment elsewhere.

FT  17 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Proposals target small investors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR is seeking to steal the Conservative's claim to be the party of wider
share ownership with proposals for encouraging investment in the UK economy
by individuals.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, the party's City spokeswoman, yesterday told a London
conference that contrary to the impression given by the government, small
investors were being 'systematically squeezed' out of the market.
She blamed 'harsh' commission charges and the government's failure to
provide 'even reasonable protection' for consumers.
Labour proposals for the small investor are aimed at creating a framework
for encouraging individual share ownership and a stable source of
development finance.
Proposals include simplifying documentation and lowering transaction costs.
There would be a greater emphasis on training in the financial services
industry and a stream lining of the system of self-regulatory bodies in the
City.

FT  17 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour tries to blunt points of
Tory attack - Philip Stephens considers the strategy behind the opposition's
latest policy document
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are three battlegrounds on which the Conservatives hope to fight the
next general election. They have not changed since 1983 and 1987.
In spite of Mr Neil Kinnock's undoubted success in dragging Labour into the
centre ground of British politics, Conservative research shows he is still
vulnerable on three issues: the economy, defence and the trade unions.
Labour's Opportunity Britain, the draft programme for government which will
form the basis of its election manifesto, suggests that Labour privately
shares the same judgment.
The document, from a party which has sustained its recent momentum by being
'never knowingly underlaunched', builds on rather than displaces its two
predecessors - Meet the Challenge and Looking to the Future.
Mr Kinnock summed up the general theme in his opening remarks at yesterday's
typically slick launch with the comment: 'The old ideologies - command
economy at one extreme, crude free market economics at the other - do not
work'.
Put another way, Labour's alternative to Thatcherism is no longer socialism,
but the centrist social democracy which - and the document reminds us of
this repeatedly - works well in France or Italy, even Germany.
For the thesis to be credible, Mr Kinnock has to show that Labour can turn
the Tories' chosen battlegrounds into neutral territory. His hopes rest upon
what it does not promise as much as on what it does.
Beyond a general commitment to defend the realm, the document restricts
comment on nuclear disarmament to a reference to the party's previous
statements.
However, Mr Kinnock and Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow foreign secretary, have
added an important gloss to reassure the electorate.
The pledge to negotiate away Britain's independent deterrent did not, they
stressed, mean a Labour government would give up nuclear weapons in exchange
for a Soviet move to scale them down. Instead it would keep the option of
retaining some nuclear capability as long as the Soviet Union and any other
country held a nuclear arsenal.
The lengthy section on the economy is similarly full of reassuring noises.
There are two firm public spending pledges: to restore the real value of
child benefit and to increase state pensions.
Other commitments will have to wait their turn in the queue. 'There will be
no irresponsible dash for growth under Labour'.
The Conservatives undoubtedly will produce their own costings for plans to
increase capital allowances for industrial investment, for a training
'revolution', for the commitment to transform educational opportunities, for
new Technology Trusts and for a more responsive health service.
Mr Kinnock's response is already there. Labour has learnt to balance its
ambitions with prudence. 'We will not spend, nor will we promise to spend,
more than Britain can afford'.
Nationalisation is not a word in the new Labour vocabularly. Instead the
party plans to take 'control' of the national electricity grid. The other
privatised industries, including perhaps British Telecom, look safe in terms
of ownership but would be subject to a tighter regulatory framework.
The basic strategy is underpinned by a commitment to preserve sterling's
place in the European exchange rate mechanism and an apparently casual
acceptance of the inevitability of European economic and monetary union.
London, the document says, is the natural home for a European central bank.
There is no change in the proposals of Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor,
to raise the top rate of tax to 50 per cent and to abolish the ceiling on
national insurance payments. The calculation is that only a little over 10
per cent of those in work would suffer.
There is a warning for wage bargainers. Labour's plan to integrate in the
Budget its public spending and tax decisions following a national economic
assessment is designed to deliver a simple message to trade unions - what
they take in excessive pay rises cannot be paid out in higher spending on
the health service or in help for the low paid.
The language on industrial relations still bears the imprint of Labour's
intractable ties with the unions. 'We fully support and advocate 100 per
cent trade union membership at the workplace', it says.
In contrast, the closed shop does not merit a mention and, as elsewhere, the
emphasis is on 'best European prac-tice'.
The Tories are convinced there is still plenty in the document to shoot at,
but Mr Kinnock has further narrowed the angle of fire.

FT  17 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Major claims growing support for
safe havens - Kurdish refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major, the prime minister, yesterday claimed growing international
support for his proposal that safe havens should be established within Iraq
for the Kurdish refugees fleeing from the forces of President Saddam
Hussein.
His statement was followed by the announcement late last night that Britain
would join the US and France in sending troops into northern Iraq to support
the international effort to aid the Kurds.
British officials indicated that the effort - designed to provide stable
bases in Iraq for the Kurdish relief effort - represented a considerable
vindication of the effort first pressed by Mr Major on the European
Community last week.
The announcement came after telephone conversation between Mr Major and US
President George Bush and Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the United Nations
secretary-general.
Describing the safe havens proposal as the 'only way forward', Mr Major told
the House of Commons that the idea was 'rapidly gaining ground'.
Loyalists on the Conservative backbenches competed with each other to praise
Mr Major's initiative, but he was criticised from the opposition benches for
not pressing more vigorously for the arraignment of Saddam Hussein for
genocide against the Kurds.
A renewed charge of 'ditherer' was levelled against the Mr Major from the
opposition benches when, pressed by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, to
pursue the genocide issue as a matter of urgency, he said he was awaiting
legal advice.
The prime minister's apparent hesitancy over charging Saddam Hussein with
genocide reflects the belief in government circles that it would probably
prove to be a fruitless exercise.
Ensuring speedy and effective assistance for the refugees is seen as the
over-riding priority.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, insisted in the Commons
exchanges that the UN already had authority to prevent the continuing
genocide against the Kurds.
He called on Mr Major to explain why he still seemed reluctant to remedy the
absence of 'political will and international leadership'.
Mr Major emphasised that his safe havens proposal continued to dominate the
international stage and was under 'intensive discussion'.

British Technology Group

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is considering taking a golden share in the British
Technology Group, the government's agency for backing inventors, to prevent
asset stripping by a future buyer.
Mr Edward Leigh, a junior industry minister, said yesterday that
privatisation of the group, which masterminds the transfer of technology
into commercial operations, would include measures to prevent a purchaser
from asset stripping, or from ceasing to carry on BTG's transfer technology
activities.
This could be ensured either through the articles of assoc-iation of the
privatised company or through the sale contract with the buyer.
'We intend to privatise this organisation in such a way that its integrity
and independence will be preserved,' Mr Leigh said.
He also announced that the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals was
interested in taking a 'small but not negligible stake in the private
company'.
During the debate, MPs from all parties expressed anxiety that privatisation
of BTG could put at stake its 8,000 patents from universities, polytech-nics
and research instit-utes.
Sir Gerard Vaughan (C Reading East) said he did not believe the minister had
given sufficient safeguards for the future of the organis-ation.
Sir Gerard said it ran the risk of being taken over by a 'huge industrial
concern, almost certainly from overseas', whose sole objective would be to
take over BTG's patents and use them for its own commercial advan-tage.
Mr Jeremy Bray, the opposition technology spokesman, accused the government
of having no clear idea of what it wanted to do with BTG or with the process
of technology transfer.

EXTENSIVE changes to rules covering how investment firms handle clients'
money were proposed yesterday by the Securities and Investments Board, the
chief investment regulator.
The board did not suggest significant changes of principle in spite of
concern expressed after the collapse of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, the
financial services group that went into administration last year. The
changes, on which comments should be made by June 28, include:
If clients of an investment firm specify a bank where they want their cash
to be held, the money will not be 'pooled' with that of other investors if
another bank used by the same investment firm collapses. Investment firms
will have to warn clients if at any time in the future they might put money
into a bank owned by the group to which the firm belongs. Firms will have to
notify professional investors if their money is not held separately from the
firms' own funds.

FT  17 APR 91 / Government accused of ignorance about police
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOME OFFICE is ignorant of simple management information about
provincial police forces, the National Audit Office said yesterday. Until
last year it did not know the number or age of provincial police stations,
although many need of repairs or replacing.
In a critical report on the Home Office's monitoring of the 41 provincial
police forces in England and Wales, the NAO highlights a series of
weaknesses and calls for an overhaul of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary,
which reports to the home secretary.
While spending on provincial policing has doubled to more than Pounds 3bn
over the past decade, recorded crime has jumped by 40 per cent. It is not
clear that the money has been matched by better policing and greater
efficiency, the report concludes. 'The time seems right for a fundamental
review of (HM Inspectorate of Constabulary's) functions, methods of
operation and resources,' it says.
The Home Office knows little about how police resources are deployed, how
officers spend their time and what standards of performance are achieved,
the NAO says. Although the Home Office collects information to promote value

FT  17 APR 91 / British Rail exceeds budget target by 60%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXTENT of British Rail's deepening financial crisis was highlighted
yesterday when it emerged that BR's call on government grants and borrowings
had soared beyond Pounds 1bn in the year to March 1991.
BR began the financial year with a target call on government funds of Pounds
635m. That was revised in July last year to Pounds 700m, but the final
figure announced yesterday was Pounds 1.016bn - exactly 60 per cent over the
original budget.
The figures were given by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, in
answer to a written parliamentary question.
Mr Rifkind did not give an explanation for the overshoot, but the main
factors are understood to be a downturn in passenger and freight revenues
caused by the recession, a shortfall in anticipated revenues from property
sales and lettings, and an upsurge in spending on safety measures.
BR's call on government funds - known as the external financing limit, or
EFL - is the amount it receives from the government each year to cover the
gap between income and spending.
Part of the EFL consists of the subsidies BR receives for operating
loss-making regional railways and Network SouthEast services. The rest
consists of loans from the National Loans Fund to help fund investment in
the railway infrastructure.
Over the last few years, a combination of buoyant property and fares income,
together with a progressive reduction in subsidies for loss-making services,
has resulted in a gra-dual reduction of the EFL.
In the year just started, however, the EFL is set to rise still higher than
last year's figure because a sharp upturn in investment spending is
coinciding with a continuing downturn in revenues.
BR forecasts that on current trends it will overshoot the 1991-92 EFL target
of Pounds 1.122bn by Pounds 650m, and it is negotiating with the government
for an increase in the figure.
The government, however, is unlikely to agree to the whole of the increase
sought by BR. The result is that BR will have to postpone investment and
embark on a round of painful cost-cutting at a time when it is trying to
improve services.
The higher-than-expected EFL figure also depresses prospects for the
privatisation of BR. It implies that, after three years in the late 1980s
during which the corporation's non-property activities returned to profit,
the losses of Pounds 46.6m on ordinary operations reported for the financial
year to March 1990 are to become still worse.
The InterCity operation, a prime candidate for privatisation because it made
profits in 1988-89 and 1989-90, is in danger of having returned to loss in
1990-91; and the figures suggest that Network SouthEast's dependency on
state subsidies is likely to continue until much later than the planned
deadline of 1992-93.
BR's cash shortfall is also putting the corporation at loggerheads with the
rail unions because the management is using it as a justification for its
refusal to meet the unions' demands in the annual pay round.

FT  17 APR 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Ex-finance chief tells of breach of SE
rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTY NATWEST Securities breached Stock Exchange rules by delaying in
reporting to it that it held more than 5 per cent of Blue Arrow, Mr David
McMullan, then finance director of CNWS, told the Blue Arrow trial
yesterday.
Mr McMullan, a prosecution witness, told the court that since CNWS held just
less than 5 per cent of the company, he checked daily to see that the level
requiring disclosure to the exchange was not reached in normal trading.
When that happened, and CNWS's holding briefly exceeded 5 per cent, he
informed Mr Peter Dale, then managing director of CNWS. Mr Dale refused to
allow him to report it to the exchange within the statutory five days, Mr
McMullan said.
'I kept telling him we were in breach of exchange rules - this really can't
go on.'
Mr Dale had told him there were other matters that were more important,
everything would fall into place, and the reporting would be done as soon as
possible, Mr McMullan said. The report was made to the exchange more than
two weeks after the 5 per cent limit was reached.
Later, when County NatWest announced that it had a 9.5 per cent holding in
Blue Arrow, he understood why Mr Dale had wanted to delay reporting the
matter. Mr Dale told him he now knew the whole picture.
Mr McMullan also told the court that concern over a possible exchange
inquiry into CNWS's backlog in processing settlements led to alteration of
the accounting treatment of CNWS's largest holding of 31.5m shares being
considered.
Unlike other Blue Arrow shares held by CNWS, this stake, kept on a 'back,
back book', was not marked for market (adjusted to current market prices)
because of the unwritten indemnity against loss given to CNWS by its
co-subsidiary, County NatWest.
County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips and Drew Securities
and seven individuals deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the
outcome of the 1987 rights issue which funded Blue Arrow's takeover of
Manpower, the US employment group.
The trial continues today.

FT  17 APR 91 / Car makers will protest to Lamont about Budget impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEASURES announced in last month's Budget will reduce UK new car sales by
about 100,000 this year, Mr Geoffrey Whalen, managing director of Peugeot
Talbot, warned yesterday.
The chief executives of Peugeot Talbot, Rover, Ford of Britain and Vauxhall
are to meet Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, next Wednesday. They plan to
call specifically for a cut in the 10 per cent rate of special car tax.
Mr Whalen said the industry was also seeking an urgent meeting with Mr Peter
Lilley, trade and industry secretary.
Mr Whalen said Peugeot Talbot, with other car makers, had reduced its
forecast for new car sales this year to only 1.7m from an earlier forecast
before the Budget of 1.8m.
The company now expects a 15 per cent decline in demand from sales last year
of 2m. Demand in 1989 reached 2.3m.
Sales of new cars fell by 21.6 per cent in the first quarter this year
following a drop of 12.7 per cent in the whole of 1990, while new commercial
vehicle sales have been hit by a plunge in sales this year of 32.8 per cent
following a drop last year of 20.9 per cent.
Car manufacturers have become alarmed by what they see as an increasingly
hostile government attitude.
The industry has been dismayed by Budget measures - in particular, higher
fuel taxes, increased personal benefit taxation of company cars, and the
imposition of national insurance contributions on company cars. Industry
leaders are incensed in particular that the chancellor failed to reduce the
special car tax when he announced an increase in VAT from 15 per cent to
17.5 per cent. Other Budget measures included higher fuel taxes.
The industry argues that no other leading vehicle-producing country in
Europe singles out cars for such a discriminatory tax as the special car
tax.

FT  17 APR 91 / Judge's summing-up criticised in Guinness appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Court of Appeal was told yesterday of 'consternation in the corridors'
at Southwark Crown Court after the jury had retired to consider its verdicts
in the Guinness trial last summer.
Miss Clare Montgomery, for Mr Anthony Parnes, a City stockbroker, said that
all counsel had been stunned when, in the closing minutes of his summing-up,
Mr Justice Henry told the jury they need not deal with charges brought under
section 151 of the 1985 Companies Act.
From the time of the pre-trial hearings, the judge had consistently declined
unilaterally to remove those charges from the indictment but had asked the
prosecution to do so, because he regarded them as inconsistent with other
charges under the Theft Act, Miss Montgomery said.
Three defendants - Mr Parnes, serving a 2 1/2 -year jail sentence in Ford
open prison, West Sussex; Mr Ernest Saunders, former Guinness chairman and
chief executive, serving five years; and Mr Gerald Ronson, head of the Heron
Group, fined Pounds 5m and released in February after serving just under
half his 12-month sentence - are appealing against their convictions and
sentences.
Central to the appeals is what is claimed was Mr Justice Henry's
misdirection of the jury on section 151, which makes it an offence for a
company to give financial assistance for the purchase of its own shares.
Defence counsel complain that the judge withdrew the section 151 charges
from the jury after leaving it with the impression that there had been
unlawful breaches of the section in an illegal share support operation
mounted by Guinness during its 1986 takeover battle for Distillers.
Mr Michael Sherrard, QC, for Mr Ronson, said the dishonesty posited by that
direction tainted the other charges of theft and false accounting, which
related to the payment by Guinness of indemnities and success fees to share
supporters.
Miss Montgomery said the jury must have considered the question of the
defendants' honesty in relation to the other charges on the assumption that
they had acted dishonestly in relation to the section 151 matters.
Mr Anthony Shaw, for Mr Saunders, said the judge had described the section
151 charges as the prosecution's fallback position. In fact they and the
Theft Act charges had been 'mutually destructive alternatives'.
The prosecution could either establish that Mr Saunders had authority to
bind Guinness, and so establish the section 151 charges, or that he lacked
such authority, and so establish the theft and false-accounting charges.
Mr Shaw said he would not after all be applying to introduce fresh medical
evidence on Mr Saunders' appeal against conviction but only on the appeal
against sentence.
It had been suggested that Mr Saunders' symptoms were similar to those of a
depressive illness, of which evidence had been given at the trial, Mr Shaw
said.
The appeals continue today.

FT  17 APR 91 / World Trade News: US hopeful of agreeing new chip pact with
Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US semiconductor industry officials are optimistic that the US and Japan may
reach a new semiconductor trade agreement at talks in Tokyo later this week.
The talks are aimed at renewing a 1986 pact between the US and Japan on
semiconductor trade which expires at the end of July. In the original
agreement Japan undertook to increase imports of foreign-made semiconductor
products and to end 'dumping' of memory chips in US and other markets.
In a side letter to the 1986 pact, Japan acknowledged the US goal of
achieving a foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market of 'at least
20 per cent' by the time the agreement expired.
Currently, however, the foreign share of the Japanese market stands at about
13 per cent, according to US calculations.
A new agreement is expected to restate the 20 per cent figure as a 'goal' to
be achieved over the next two years. Japanese officials initially opposed
the inclusion of any market share target in a new agreement, but now appear
ready to compromise.
The officials said they would consider a US request that a new pact specify
a 20 per cent share but on condition the figure is not a guarantee.
In return, the US may be be willing to eliminate trade sanctions imposed in
1987 when the US charged that Japan was failing to live up to the terms of
the original semiconductor pact.
The 1986 agreement also created anti-dumping measures including a price
monitoring system under which the US Commerce Department determined 'fair
market value' prices for each Japanese producer of memory chips.
The FMV system, which was blamed by some computer industry officials in the
US and Europe for a steep rise in memory chip prices, is not expected to be
included in the new trade agreement. US semiconductor industries now favour
alternative anti-dumping measures that are 'less government intrusive'.

FT  17 APR 91 / Thais take their coup with a pinch of fatalism: Peter
Ungphakorn reports on the calm after a bloodless army takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER UNGPHAKORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE weekend, as Thais celebrated their traditional New Year by drenching
each other with buckets of water, the country's generals participated in a
more sedate ceremony.
They visited the former prime minister, General Chatichai Choonhavan, at his
home and poured lustral water over his hands, a ritual indicating respect
for an elder.
And yet these were the same officers who seven weeks ago overthrew General
Chatichai, accusing his elected government of naked greed and corruption, of
meddling in the affairs of the bureaucracy, of ruling by 'parliamentary
dictatorship,' and of covering up a plot to assassinate a senior member of
the royal family.
General Chatichai himself was only back in Bangkok for a few days to receive
the highest royal decoration. He returns this week to London, where the
nervous military leadership would prefer him to live for the time being. His
assets, along with those of some of his colleagues, are still frozen, as a
top-level committee searches for evidence of wrong-doing.
'Foreigners don't understand Thai coups' is a typical Thai comment uttered
with amusement, fatalism, or a trace of complaint.
It is triggered not only by surprise at such events as took place at the
weekend but also by the initial hesitancy of foreign investors and tourists,
the queries of non-Thai organisers of the World Bank and IMF annual meetings
due to be held in Bangkok in October, and the concern of human rights
organisations about Thailand following the bloodless coup of February 23.
But Thais, too, can be taken by surprise, as they were on February 23.
Thailand was supposed to have progressed out of almost 50 years of on-off
military rule. After 11 years without a coup, the army was supposed to be
more restrained; its officers were supposed to be more modern in outlook and
to have greater respect for the country's maturing political system and,
just in case they were not, the growing business community was supposed to
be an important counter-force.
Whatever the announced reasons, the main cause of the coup was a steadily
worsening and irreconcilable rift between the military and the elected
government, culminating in General Chatichai's attempt to sack General
Sunthorn Kongsompong, armed forces' supreme commander.
And it was this same General Sunthorn, now chairman of the National
Peace-Keeping Council, as the junta calls itself, who led the top brass to
pay their New Year respects to General Chatichai.
As the country's political system adjusts to the opposing traditions of
military bravado and outward, conflict-avoiding compromise, and to more
recent democratic habits, most Thais have hardly been affected by the coup.
Many freedoms remain almost unchanged, and those that are curbed should
return to normal if elections are held on schedule next year.
Despite the continued enforcement of martial law and the short-lived
detention of a handful of anti-coup protesters, the main cause of tension in
Bangkok has been the chaos brought about by yet another attempt to
re-organise the city's one-way traffic system.
But Thailand's political system is also facing a change of direction, and
some collisions cannot be ruled out. This week's passage of bills to curb
public sector unions was achieved without protest because of martial law.
The civilian prime minister, Mr Anand Panyarachun, previously a staunch
opponent of military dictatorships, has proclaimed that his government will
conduct sound economic policy 'transparently.'
He has promised to introduce a value added tax despite public opposition and
to overhaul an outdated Thai business tax system. He also plans to cut
duties on imported raw materials, machine parts and components to reduce
costs of Thai exports, and to review income tax rates and a withholding tax
on interest earned from bank deposits.
Mr Anand, 58, a businessman and former diplomat, is supported by a cabinet
of technocrats and businessmen - and only a handful of generals - who are
determined to show that they can govern competently, honestly, and
independently of the junta, with some accountability and sensitivity to
public opinion. Hence, the emphasis on 'transparency'.
Despite the complaints about misunderstanding abroad, tourism and investment
are picking up, following the Gulf ceasefire. And the national planning
agency has increased its forecast of economic growth for this year to 9 per
cent, which would keep the Thai economy among the fastest-growing in the
world for a fourth year.
The National Peace-Keeping Council has retained ultimate political control.
It has promised not to interfere, but has a supervisory position over the
government and has summary power - shared with the prime minister -
including the power to order execution without trial.
Half of the newly-appointed National Assembly are serving officers, and many
of the rest are close to the military.
The swift passage on Monday of two controversial bills depriving
state-enterprise unions - the stronger section of Thailand's weak labour
movement - of political activity and the right to strike, shows just how
amenable the assembly is likely to be.
Many analysts predict that the Anand government will find itself in conflict
with the military, especially if some of the general's actions lead to a
further weakening of democracy, particularly in foreigners' eyes, at a time
when Thailand's image abroad is considered to be important if foreign
investment and growth are to be sustained.
Also likely to be controversial is the drafting of the new constitution
which, according to the junta's interim charter, has to be completed with
elections held by April next year. The drafting committee appointed on April
4 is charged with devising a document that would discourage vote-buying, a
problem that has worsened in recent years.
The Thai public shows little attachment to its elected representatives, but
the mood might change if the news media were muzzled, if the military were
to interfere more in civilian affairs, or if the junta were to take a liking
to power.
'If they stay beyond April (next year), there will be trouble,' warns one
Thai businessman, who wholeheartedly endorsed the coup.

FT  17 APR 91 / Turkish PM rejects criticism of relief effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Turkish prime minister, Mr Yildirim Akbulut, yesterday appealed to the
international community to make greater efforts to help Turkey cope with the
Kurdish exodus from Iraq instead of criticising Turkey's own relief work.
Speaking a few hours before President Bush announced his expanded aid effort
involving protective zones in northern Iraq, Mr Akbulut told a news
conference in London that the 25 planeloads of foreign aid sent to Turkey by
the start of this week had been 'a drop in the ocean'. Turkey needed 50,000
tents to shelter the 400,000 Iraqi Kurds who had already crossed the border,
but had received only 8,000 from abroad in addition to the 3,000 given by
Turkey itself.
'It's not an easy task and it's not a task that Turkey alone can
accomplish,' he said. 'Twenty-five planeloads of aid material - Okay, we are
grateful, but this is not a solution.'
Mr Akbulut said televised scenes of Turkish troops pushing back Kurdish
refugees to keep order were interpreted as 'Turkish soldiers torturing
people'. He denied that Turkish soldiers had killed a single Iraqi Kurd.
Furthermore, he said, Turkey was still looking after 29,000 Kurds who fled
from Iraq in 1988. Only 500 had been accepted by other countries, yet people
criticised Turkey for the conditions in the camps.
'We tell them, OK, come and take these people in your own country. Why does
Turkey, making such immense sacrifices, earn such criticism?'
Under intense international pressure, Turkey has begun to move some of the
recently arrived Iraqi Kurds from exposed mountain sides near the border to
a site at Silopi deeper inside Turkey.
Mr Akbulut, however, said they would quickly be replaced on the mountains by
up to 200,000 more Kurds streaming in from Iraq.
Mr Akbulut said: 'Whatever we propose as a measure now is only a temporary
solution. . . it is our policy that these people must by all means go back
to their own homes. This is a must.'

FT  17 APR 91 / Aid agencies try to make sense of refugee politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   DIYARBAKIR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL confusion over the future of Iraqi refugees stranded in
inaccessible places along Turkey's south-east border has compounded
difficulties faced by humanitarian agencies in forging a common relief
policy.
In the hours before the UN's announcement last night of protective zones for
the Kurds in northern Iraq, Mrs Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, got her first glimpse of problems faced in the
camps. Meanwhile aid officials in Diyarbakir argued over the role of the US
airdrop launched last week to help an estimated 300,000 Iraqi Kurds who have
fled to Turkey. The aid agencies have been told they have 30 days before the
US hands over responsibility to the United Nations.
Politically, the issue is complicated by Turkey's reluctance to give the
refugees permanent sanctuary, and the concern of the UN High Commission for
Refugees to accord the fleeing Kurds their rights under the convention on
the treatment of refugees.
Turkey, which is a signatory to the convention, has a so-called geographic
limitation which means it does not recognise non-European refugees and is
confining refugees to border areas. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said
yesterday the local governor's decision to move some 20,000 to Silopi on
Monday, was taken on humanitarian grounds and did not constitute a change in
policy.
'These people are not refugees. The do not have refugee status. A permanent
settlement should be found inside Iraq,' said the official.
'We don't care which way they go. As relief workers we want to get the
refugees into places where we can realistically take over from the
Americans,' said Mr Hugo Slim of the Save the Children Fund, the UK charity.
The US has been emphasising that the airdrop has been a temporary operation
'while international organisations continue their preparations to assume
responsibility for assistance to the refugees'. But, in advance of the
expanded aid effort announced last night, many charities in the region had
been concerned that Washington was ignoring the longer term relief strategy,
in the rush to ferry emergency relief to the areas.
The need for a longer term strategy - the object of Mr Bush's initiative
last night - was underlined yesterday when the relief shuttles taking
supplies from Diyarbakir to the camps had to be postponed because of bad
weather and mechanical problems with some of the Chinook helicopters.
US officials have made clear that the helicopter drops would not be made
inside Iraq, leaving that to the Hercules C-130 flying out of Incirlik 300
miles from the Iraqi border.
US civil affairs officers were yesterday in the camps trying to establish
distribution networks among the refugees in a bid to avoid the chaos that
has followed earlier airdrops when a number of refugees have been killed.
The US is dropping 'ready to eat' meals, baby food purees and packaged
water. However, once the aid agencies take over, the refugees will receive
simpler fare - beans and lentils. These supplies would normally be trucked
in. Yet many of the sites are at present inaccessible by road.
The danger has been that the US airdrop might consolidate the existing
refugee sites which relief officials believe would be all but impossible to
sustain on a more permanent basis. One official said the camps would then
become 'permanently inappropriate'.

NEWS OF an austerity package, including a 10 per cent sales tax, dampened
Egyptian celebrations for the end of the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan
yesterday.
The announcement, timed to coincide with the most cheerful day of the
Islamic calendar and the forthcoming May Day bonus for government workers,
also heralded sharp increases in petrol prices and electricity charges to
comply with the demands of the International Monetary Fund.
Egypt, which has just agreed in principle a new Dollars 350m standby
arrangement with the Fund, has been under pressure to reduce its budget
deficit by further reining in subsides and by increasing revenue-raising
measures. Petrol prices will rise by 30 per cent and electricity by 35 per
cent.

FT  17 APR 91 / Allies comb Kuwait for delayed action bombs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUWAIT CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED bomb disposal experts are combing Kuwait in search of sophisticated
Iraqi charges capable of detonating up to 500lb of high-explosives 99 days
after being set.
A cache of 52 such devices has already been discovered, but allied
commanders are worried that the Iraqis may have set and hidden a few of the
time-delayed charges in key installations before their hasty retreat in late
February. If the charges were planted, they could detonate explosives any
time up to the end of May.
The device, which bomb disposal officers describe as a 'sinister and
sophisticated development', is a further indication of Iraq's determination
to cause as much damage as possible to Kuwait before retreating.
Allied generals raised the matter of the devices with the Iraqis during the
post-war talks held in Safwan; any remaining live charges in the country
would directly breach the formal ceasefire agreement. However, Iraqi
generals were apparently unable to give any information on the booby-trap
explosives.
Allied officers say they believe that the unexpected speed of the Iraqi
forces' capitulation in Kuwait interrupted any plans to deploy the explosive
charges.
Nevertheless, the 1,000 allied bomb disposal experts working to clear Kuwait
of mines and unexploded bombs were briefed this week on the Iraqi device and
are continuing to carry out searches at all Kuwait's power, oil and other
key installations.
'If we get to the end of May without anything happening, we'll be reasonably
confident,' a senior allied officer said yesterday.
The original stock of devices was discovered in workshops in al Ahmedi, the
country's main oil centre south of Kuwait City. All of them were packed in
boxes and none had been set.
The devices gave no clue where they were manufactured, but allied officers
say they are 'far the most sophisticated' of any Iraqi explosive device yet
found.
Each comprises a booster charge of about 6lb of explosives in a metal
cylinder about the size of a milk bottle, equipped with highly sophisticated
microcircuitry to enable a time delay from an hour to 99 days. This, in
turn, is set in a frame within a 26-inch bicycle wheel - a format which
allied officers describe as 'rather a mystery'.
However, ordnance disposal experts say the frame is exactly the right size
to be fitted on to a 50-gallon drum, which if filled with high explosives
could render an effective charge of 500lb of explosives.
Moreover, the bicycle wheel could also be fitted inside a pipeline, which is
the possibility causing disposal experts the most concern.

ISRAELI settlers yesterday began moving into the first Jewish settlement to
be established in the occupied West Bank for two years in direct defiance of
US warnings that such actions could jeopardise its efforts to broker a
Middle East peace accord.
The government-financed settlers said they had deliberately moved forward
plans to occupy the settlement - originally given official approval as a
settlement site eight years ago - to take place before Mr James Baker, the
US secretary of state, returns to Israel later this week to pursue proposals
for Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. Last night the White House said the
settlement was an obstacle to the peace process.
More than a dozen mobile homes, acquired through the Housing Ministry run by
Mr Ariel Sharon, a vocal opponent of Mr Baker's peace proposals, were
transported overnight to the settlement site, called Revava, where several
families prepared to move in immediately. The settlers fear peace talks
could undermine Israeli rule over the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Ministers in the government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, which supports settlement
and has rejected Washington's view that they are an obstacle to peace,
refused to distance themselves from yesterday's move. Mr Shamir says there
is no link between settlements and the peace process.
In London yesterday, Mr Shamir likened the Israeli settlers in the
territories to Arab residents of Israel proper and said it was normal for
people to build houses.
'It doesn't make any difference if there will be in these disputed
territories 100 settlements or 120 settlements,' he told a news conference.
'The permanent political solution will be accepted outside this fact.'
Mr Shamir yesterday met Mr Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister, in a
sign of the improving relations between the two countries.
But the Israeli premier was unable to say if the Soviet Union would agree to
Israel's demand that full diplomatic ties be restored if Moscow wishes to
join Washington in supervising a proposed regional Middle East peace
conference.
'It is absolutely necessary that before a meeting the Soviet Union will
establish with Israel normal diplomatic relations. . . Mr Pavlov told me
that they will think about it and consider it.'
In Israel, Mr Ehud Olmert, the health minister, said he agreed the
establishment of Revava was awkwardly timed, but added: 'On the other hand,
if indeed settlements are a vital component of government policy, it is
better not to play hide and seek.'
This attitude infuriates the Palestinians, who told Mr Baker last week that
they could not take the proposition of peace talks with Israel seriously as
long as settlement continued.
Some 100,000 Jews now live in the West Bank and Gaza, a figure that rose by
about 10 per cent last year.
Israeli opposition groups also bitterly condemned the new settlement.
'(Revava) is a provocation against the peace process and it is meant to
deter any Arab who wants to talk peace with Israel today. . . and to lead us
to the next war,' said Mr Ran Cohen, Citizens Rights Movement MP.

FT  17 APR 91 / Brady takes wider view of bank's operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Euromarkets Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US treasury secretary, Mr Nicholas Brady, emphasised yesterday the
strong role of the board of directors in the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
'We do not view the activity of the board as an advisory one, but, instead,
as a critical element of the bank's operations,' he said in a speech to the
EBRD inaugural meeting.
His speech reinforced the differences in approach to the bank by the US and
some other shareholders (which see a relatively narrow focus for the bank in
encouraging the private sector in east Europe), and the broader view of the
bank as the first truly pan-European organisation being taken by others,
including its president, Mr Jacques Attali.
'We believe strongly that the EBRD's focus should be private sector
development and the financing of infrastructure which directly supports
private sector activity,' Mr Brady said.
Reinforcing the message, a senior US Treasury official said afterwards that
it was the job of the shareholders to set the policy of the bank 'and it's
down to the management to carry out those policies.'
In his speech, Mr Brady said the bank would need to keep in mind the
activities of other bilateral and multilateral donors to the region 'in
order to avoid duplication and conflicting operations.'

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSIAL EC legislation aimed at ending piracy of computer software
could face a last-minute battle in the European parliament today after more
than a year of frenetic lobbying by rival camps in the computer industry.
The European Commission is afraid that the compromise thrashed out with EC
member states in December will be jeopardised if the parliament adopts
amendments to the directive.
The proposed directive, part of the EC single market programme, aims to
extend copyright laws to computer software. It has been the subject of a
fierce struggle between large computer groups, such as IBM, which want
strict rules on copyright protection, and smaller groups which want the
ability to create software which is compatible with their larger rivals'
products.
The December compromise would allow a limited amount of 'reverse
engineering' - the unpicking of programs by smaller groups in order to
create compatible software.
Christian Democrat MEPs, the second largest grouping in the parliament, are
expected to vote against the amendments, put forward by a parliamentary
committee, which aim to broaden the scope for reverse engineering. However,
the largest group, the Socialists, has yet to decide its position, and the
pressure looks likely to continue right up to this evening's vote.
If the Socialists abstain or vote against, then a majority in favour of the
amendments would be impossible and the directive would pass back to
Community ministers unchanged for formal adoption by a qualified majority of
member states.
If the amendments go through, however, the directive would then require the
unanimous approval of member states, which could prove difficult.
Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC commissioner responsible for the internal
market, said yesterday he hoped MEPs would throw out the amendments. He told
the deputies that the Commission and EC ministers had taken account of
parliament's views after the first reading of the directive last July.
Several MEPs yesterday condemned the intense lobbying which has plagued the
measure, claiming that colleagues aligned to one or other industry camp were
still trying to enlist the support of undecided deputies.

FT  17 APR 91 / EC says Dollars 23bn pledged to E Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROMISES OF financial aid to the countries of east Europe now total Dollars
23bn (Pounds 12.8bn) according to the European Community, which is
co-ordinating the aid effort among the Group of 24 donor countries.
This includes Dollars 8bn in the form of grants, Dollars 1.7bn in structural
loans from EC bodies such as the European Investment Bank, Dollars 11.4bn
pledged as capital for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
and Dollars 2bn in bilateral loans and credits.
Mr Henning Christophersen, the EC representative at the inaugural meeting of
the EBRD, told reporters yesterday that these promises were in addition to
balance of payments support for east Europe.
The EC had identified a financing gap of Dollars 15bn for this year, some
two-thirds of which would be covered by the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank. This left some Dollars 4bn of balance of payments support to be
provided by the Group of 24 this year.
A Dollars 1bn loan had been agreed for Czechoslovakia, a new Dollars 500m
loan was close to agreement for Hungary, while efforts had begun to raise
Dollars 800m for Bulgaria and Dollars 1bn for Romania. All the loans were
dependent on their agreeing economic reform programmes with the IMF. Half
this would come from the EC.
Last year, a Dollars 1bn currency stabilisation loan for Poland had been
agreed (still untouched in the New York Federal Reserve Bank) and a further
Dollars 1bn for Hungary. Mr Christophersen also did not rule out assistance
for Albania.
On top of that, it was estimated that Poland's debt servicing bill would be
reduced by about Dollars 5.5bn in the first year as a result of the
agreement last month with the Paris Club of creditor governments.
He said early estimates for the financing assistance needed next year by
east Europe suggested they needed less than in 1991. But that depended on
two main factors: the extent to which trade collapsed within the old Comecon
trading bloc and the oil price.
He said some Ecu400m (Pounds 276m) had been promised this year by the EC in
technical assistance for the Soviet Union, and Ecu600m next year.

FT  17 APR 91 / Spain tries to slim its over-weight peseta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKETS were not convinced that last night's decision by Madrid to lift
its last remaining controls on capital outflows would seriously weaken the
peseta.
With official interest rates at 13.5 per cent and inflation at 5.9 per cent,
the currency will remain Europe's most attractive, it seems, whatever
administrative measures Madrid takes to make it otherwise.
Spain is now suffering its most uncomfortable moments since entering the
European monetary system in June 1989. The peseta's strength has forced the
Bank of Spain to intervene more in the markets this year than in all
previous 18 months together. The pickle is of its own making.
When the peseta went into the EMS, the government wanted it strong to
cheapen imports and force local suppliers to compete. But demand was so
strong then it did not have to. And even the imposition of 10 per cent
limits on bank credit growth has served only to punish, not educate. Since
the restriction was lifted at the end of 1990, private credit growth has
soared again to 21.5 per cent.
The decision yesterday to allow Spaniards to open foreign currency accounts
with banks at home may encourage outflows of capital big enough to take some
presure off. But not much.
By limiting the accounts to Spain, the government is trying to avoid a
massive flight of untaxed 'black money' - of which there could be up to
Dollars 50bn in Spain. That outflow is unlikely to happen now.
Also lifting the restriction permitting banks to lend only 50 per cent of
their convertible peseta deposits to non-residents is not going to make many
waves.
Nevertheless, apart from one control designed to discourage short-term
foreign borrowing by residents, Spain has now entirely shed its once
impressive range of capital controls. Earlier this year it disposed of an
irritating barrier which forced any Spaniard borrowing cheaply abroad to
deposit 30 per cent of the loan, interest free, with the Bank of Spain.
In the past 12 months a similar rule on bank borrowing abroad has been
dropped, and non-residents are now being paid interest on convertible peseta
deposits of more than Pta10m (Pounds 54,000). Foreigners are also now
allowed to do repurchase deals on government securities.
Lifting the restrictions has doubtless helped feed Spain's chronic appetite
for foreign capital to finance its currrent account deficits. Withholding
tax on Treasury bills was lifted at the beginning of the year and the
Treasury is speeding up repayment of withholding tax on bonds to encourage
foreign buyers.
Paradoxically, perhaps, the liberalisation of the Spanish economy has done
little more than make the currency more attractive. Since the beginning of
this year alone, the value of government bonds held by foreigners has
tripled to Dollars 12bn.
The reason remains the fact that Spain has the highest real interest rates
in Europe and the reasonable expectation that inflation will fall further.
The markets are convinced interest rates will have to fall soon, which was
probably why yesterday's capital control measures were taken so lightly.

FT  17 APR 91 / Hungary's stability may prove precarious: The apparent
political calm will be tested to the full this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN artificial calm prevails in Hungary while economic collapse and national
conflict buffet its neighbours. By contrast, Hungary appears economically
and politically stable.
But it is a fragile stability which this year will be tested to the full.
Most Hungarians have been suffering from stagnating living standards for a
decade. Democracy and economic liberalisation were supposed to solve that.
But patience is running out a year after free elections, and it is on that
patience that Hungary's current equilibrium is precariously balanced.
Nevertheless, on the surface at least, Hungarian politics have rapidly
become surprisingly normal. When last spring's elections produced a
governing conservative coalition, a strong liberal opposition and a
socialist (ex-communist) rump, most commentators said it could not last.
But the coalition has defied its critics, giving Hungary the closest thing
to western-style two-party politics in eastern Europe.
What is more, the move to democracy has been achieved without any abrupt
change in government policy. The conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum
came to power last spring with the slogan that it was 'The calm force' and
the implicit claim that the party would not turn Hungary upside down.
Mr Jozsef Antall, the prime minister, has not let down his electors.
The continuity is so striking that people can be forgiven for the
commonly-held belief that nothing has changed since the election except the
rising prices.
There has been no about-turn on economic policy. The former government's
tight monetary and fiscal stance has been maintained; quick and
decentralised privatisation has returned to favour; and the commitment to
repaying Hungary's Dollars 21bn debt has, if anything, been reinforced.
December's appointment of Mr Mihaly Kupa to head the Finance Ministry, where
he had been a widely-respected official, marked the victory of bureaucratic
pragmatism. The cabinet reshuffle muted the ideological arguments within the
cabinet which had crippled policy-making.
Mr Kupa's self-proclaimed pragmatism has also taken the heat out of the
wider debate on whether to treat the economy with shock therapy or not.
Opposition politicians and economists are hard-pressed to take issue with
the finance minister's programme of reform legislation.
Nor has there been a witch-hunt of officials associated with the communist
regime. 'Against the greatest pressure, we didn't kick out everyone or make
a B-list,' said Mr Istvan Forrai, head of the prime minister's secretariat.
While the government takes pride in its conservatism, the opposition accuses
it of inaction and missed opportunities.
'What more can a government do in such a period but to maintain financial,
internal, political and personnel stability?' asks Mr Istvan Forrai, head of
the prime minister's secretariat, in return.
So successful has this policy been that Hungary is now the most attractive
country in eastern Europe for investment. Half of all western investment in
the region went to Hungary last year, according to Mr Bela Kadar, minister
for international economic relations.
But that investment, and a boom in exports with the west, have not been
enough to offset the slump of the surrounding east European economies.
Hungary's exports to former Comecon countries fell by 24 per cent last year,
the most important factor behind a 4-5 per cent fall in measured gross
domestic product. The government predicts the same fall in output for 1991.
Average living standards, cushioned by the black economy, are probably not
falling by nearly that much. But the figures hide growing income inequality.
A tenth of people are much better off, three-tenths are worse off and the
rest stay the same, according to Mr Gabor Istvan, a professor at the
Budapest University of Economics.
The losers are numerous enough to make for widespread discontent, expressed
in deep unpopularity with the government: one recent poll gave the Forum 14
per cent.
More dangerously, an opinion poll commissioned by the European Community
showed that 75 per cent of Hungarians were dissatisfied with the way that
democracy had developed, much more than in other east European countries.
No one quite knows what expression public disillusion will take. Last
October, it emerged in a three-day protest against higher petrol prices. In
a recent by-election it was shown by a 25 per cent turnout and victory for
the socialists.
The prime minister warned recently that the extremes of right and left
'together endanger the Hungarian political democracy which is being born.'
One senior Forum official fears the demagogues within his own party who
would emerge if the government fell. The industry minister fears a wave of
strikes. Mr Mihaly Laki, an economic adviser to the opposition Free
Democrats, fears the anti-parliamentary sentiment which would lead people to
accept an authoritarian leader as the price of an economic miracle.
But it is clear that there is a large and unpredictable body of Hungarians
which appears to be indifferent to elections and is largely motivated by
economic well-being. 'They are so secularised and atomised,' says Mr Forrai.
'They are real materialists. . . in a harsh and individualistic society.'
The question is whether their discontent will ignite before economic
prosperity can defuse it.

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest computer company, is
considering establishing a pan-European telecommunications network based on
a novel satellite technology.
It has retained Hyperion, a UK-based information technology consultancy, to
help with a feasibility study.
If IBM decides to go ahead, it could create a substantial new market for a
telecommunications service which has so far failed to realise its potential
in Europe. It would also force IBM's competitors in the computer industry to
follow suit or risk losing market share.
The satellite system - very small aperture terminal or VSAT - is already big
business in the US.
With the relaxation of Europe's regulatory environment, it has become
increasingly possible to establish a VSAT network but so far no organisation
has taken the initiative.

FT  17 APR 91 / Bulgaria rules out debt forgiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BULGARIA yesterday ruled out any western forgiveness of its debt, saying
this could slow down its economic reforms. Mr Ivan Kostov, its finance
minister, said Bulgarian officials were meeting the Paris Club this week to
discuss arrangements to postpone or reschedule the country's debt. 'We have
never discussed the elimination of the debt . . . not even among ourselves.'
The Bulgarian authorities fear that any debt forgiveness would remove the
incentive needed to push through radical economic reforms.
Mr Kostov's comments, in the wings of the inaugural meeting of the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, followed a call for debt
forgiveness by Mr Henning Christophersen, the EC's representative at the
bank.
from
Mr Christophersen said Bulgaria should be the second east European country
after Poland to benefit from debt forgiveness. Poland last month had at
least half its debts to foreign governments written off. 'There must be a
debt relief agreement for Bulgaria. Without this, it will be impossible for
that country to get out of its difficulties,' he said.
While Poland owes about Dollars 30bn to Paris Club governments, Bulgaria's
total foreign debt is Dollars 11bn, about Dollars 2bn of which is owed to
governments.
The issue is controversial.
Japanese finance ministry officials have said that the Dollars 500m loan
promised to Poland by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has been blocked
following Poland's deal with the Paris Club.
A senior US Treasury official said yesterday that such a halt would be
'unacceptable', although the chief loser would be Japan, which would have
'demonstrated its inability to respond to questions of world leadership on
financial issues.'
He added, however, that the US government had no direct knowledge that the
loan had been blocked. It had not been discussed at a meeting between Mr
Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, and Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's
finance minister, last weekend.
Mr Victor Geraschenko, head of the Soviet Union's central bank, called
yesterday for an early lifting of restrictions imposed on EBRD lending to
his country. Greater assistance from the bank and other western financial
institutions would stem the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
In particular, he hoped that a clause that the total volume of all credits
and other services received from the EBRD during the first three years
should not exceed (the Soviet Union's) paid in capital 'would be eliminated
in the near future.'

The Soviet Union is in a crisis similar to that which led to martial law in
Poland in 1981, Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, Polish prime minister, warned
yesterday, writes Anthony Robinson. It faces social unrest and strikes, a
futile attempt to find a 'third way' between socialism and capitalism, and
is trying to balance supply and demand by centrally controlled prices and
wages, he told the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London. This
would inevitably lead to a price-wage spiral and hyper-inflation followed
either by an authoritarian, 'Byzantine' solution or the slow process of
installing democracy. But it took 10 years of political activity by
Solidarity to convince Poles there was an alternative to communism while the
Soviet Union had centuries of authoritarian traditions to overcome, he
added.

   TOKYO, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Soviet Union's senior industrial figure yesterday broke with
newly-established Soviet tradition and professed optimism about his
country's future, write John Lloyd in Tokyo and Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
Mr Arkady Volsky, president of the Science and Industrial Union which groups
the heads of major enterprises in the Soviet Union, told industrialists in
Tokyo that output in the semi-privatised sector of the Soviet economy had
risen by 4.5 per cent in the first quarter.
'It should be a matter of some joy that this is happening,' he said,
stressing that this was an unofficial view. The semi-privatised sector
involves enterprises operating on leases or on a co-operative basis, and is
thus the closest to private enterprise. Its rise compares with a 10 per cent
drop in state sector output.
Mr Volsky said the new managers of Soviet enterprises were often young and
talented. 'It's a young power structure that's coming up, and they think
they can do something. There is a left and a right in our country  - but
there is a third force, and that is the directors of the enterprises. That
is the real force.'
Conceding that 'if you look at the situation in our country today, any
company would be cautious', he nevertheless maintained that 'this is the
best time to do business there . . . . We have the cheapest real estate. You
must enter the Soviet market today'.
Mr Volsky, whom some see as the next prime minister, has forged his
association into a powerful lobby. It contributes significantly to new
legislation on industrial and enterprise matters, including the law on
entrepreneurship and the forthcoming laws on privatisation and investments
which will allow foreigners to own 100 per cent of companies set up in the
Soviet Union.
He said the anti-crisis plan, to be introduced shortly by Mr Pavlov in the
Supreme Soviet, was relatively unimportant. 'We have lots of programmes: the
point is to get some action going.'
The domestic turmoil in the Soviet Union continued yesterday as Mr Zviad
Gamsakhurdia, leader of Georgia, issued his first presidential decree to
call for a co-ordinated civil disobedience campaign across the southern
republic.
Mr Gamsakhurdia is trying to force the Kremlin to withdraw troops from the
strife-torn enclave of South Ossetia and to grant Georgia independence. He
has already managed to trigger a republican-wide rail strike to back these
demands.
The Soviet parliament, meeting in closed session, was yesterday reported to
have given preliminary approval to a bill outlawing political strikes, in a
bid to help crush the industrial action engulfing the country. Independent
unions from all over the Russian Federation are due to gather in Moscow
today to consider a one-day strike on April 26 to express solidarity with
the economic and political demands of striking coal miners.

FT  17 APR 91 / Italy's Republicans caught between principle and the
wilderness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision by Italy's small Republican party not to support the five-party
coalition, within which it has helped govern the country since 1983, is
surprising even by Italian political standards.
It followed the party's refusal last weekend to accept the three ministries
offered in Mr Giulio Andreotti's new government, and reflects Republican
leaders' fury at what they see as the premier's bad faith.
Although the Republicans held only three ministries under the previous
government, which collapsed last month, they had not expected Mr Andreotti
both to change those posts and sharply reduce the powers of one of the new
ministries under offer.
Mr Andreotti's task in forming a government - his seventh and Italy's 50th
since the Second World War - has been complicated by the need to find room
for the left wing of his own Christian Democratic party which has decided to
end its self-imposed exile from government posts begun in 1990.
The Republicans, however, may also have invited trouble within their own
ranks by excluding Mr Oscar Mammi, the long-serving minister for posts and
telecommunications, from their ministerial candidates. They replaced him
with Mr Giuseppe Galasso on the grounds that Mr Mammi had enjoyed enough
ministerial exposure. That decision incensed Mr Mammi, whose ministry has
been growing in importance because of the role it will play in rationalising
the country's private broadcasting bonanza by allocating frequencies. It
also provoked a substantial row inside the party.
However, their 40-5 vote on Monday not to support the new government shows
that Republican party leaders are reserving their ire for Mr Andreotti. The
party has still to clarify whether it will vote against his new government
when it presents itself to parliament today, or just abstain. Whichever way
it jumps, a four-party coalition without the Republicans could still muster
enough parliamentary support to survive.
So are the Republicans in danger of shooting themselves in the foot?
The party, which stands out because of its commitment to lower public
spending and more disciplined government in general, has long enjoyed an
intellectual weight appreciably greater than its relatively small electoral
size.
In the June 1987 general election, its share of the vote shrank to 3.7 per
cent, against 5.1 per cent four years earlier. The 1983 elections marked a
high point for the party, which was still basking in the prestige provided
by the 18-month stint of its then leader, Mr Giovanni Spadolini, as Italy's
first non-Christian Democratic prime minister since the war.
Since then, the Republicans' political influence has waned, despite Mr
Spadolini's move from party secretary to president of the Senate in July
1987. It is his successor, Mr Giorgio La Malfa, who is now in the limelight.
Despite offering his resignation following the debacle over the new
ministries, he looks set to stay in the saddle.
He and his senior party colleagues now face a new dilemma in their perennial
struggle to maintain an independent identity while sharing in government,
without being crushed by the Christian Democrats and the Socialists. They
must now decide whether the stress on principle and independence they want
to show by remaining outside the coalition might instead increase the
dangers of their own extinction.
MR GIULIO ANDREOTTI'S new government was yesterday set to be a coalition of
four parties, rather than the five which have ruled the country since 1983.
Amid a hectic round of meetings between President Francesco Cossiga and
political leaders yesterday, the emphasis was on minimising the effect of
the Republican party's refusal to participate in the coalition.
Last night Mr Andreotti's Christian Democrats joined their Socialist, Social
Democrat and Liberal partners in agreeing to carry on as a four-party
government. At the same time, the Christian Democrats issued a renewed call
to the Republicans to reconsider their decision.
However, the uncertainty caused has prompted Mr Andreotti to postpone to
today the new government's presentation before parliament. So far, only the
small, far-right Movimento Sociale Italiano has called for an early election
in response to the crisis.

FT  17 APR 91 / US ignored alert on arms to Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE White House allowed the shipment of military spare parts to Jordan until
just before the outbreak of the air war against Iraq in January, according
to past and present US government officials.
The US shipments, which included diesel engine components for armoured
vehicles and electronic testing equipment, continued in spite of
intelligence advice that the kingdom was being used as an illegal conduit
into neighbouring Iraq.
There were additional concerns from the State Department and other
government agencies that Iraq's other suppliers in the west were sending
arms, spare parts and dual-use technology - which can have military as well
as civilian applications - through Jordan as a way of evading the United
Nations embargo against Iraq.
Senior White House officials were given a written warning early last
December that military shipments from US companies to Jordan were likely to
be passed on to Iraq. It was delivered to Mr Robert Gates, the deputy
national security adviser to President Bush.
It was only several weeks later - after hostilities had begun in the Gulf -
that the warning was acknowledged. In spite of these warnings, no changes
were made to the way in which the export of military-related equipment to
Jordan from the west was scrutinised.
Yesterday, the White House said it had no comment on the issue of shipments
to Iraq and Jordan. Up until the middle of January, the administration had
denied persistent reports that Jordan was serving as a transhipment point,
arguing that the UN embargo was virtually leak-proof.
According to several administration officials, the White House had
previously given its approval to the shipment of sensitive military
equipment and technologies directly to Iraq as late as last June.
The nature and scope of US weapons sales to Iraq in 1990 is part of an
expanding Congressional inquiry into US support for Baghdad's armaments
programmes over the past five years. This support included the sale of
chemical weapons precursors, biological agents and dual-use technology
applicable in missile development.
The House Foreign Affairs sub-committee on international economic policy and
trade is focusing on several high-level inter-agency meetings chaired last
spring by Mr Gates, who was previously deputy director of the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA).
These meetings, in April, May and June, were called to come up with a
response to President Saddam Hussein, who had recently test-fired a
ballistic missile in Mauritania and threatened to scorch half of Israel.
In spite of detailed evidence known to have been available to US
intelligence on Iraq's nuclear, chemical and ballistic missile projects,
repeated sub-Cabinet meetings at the White House decided to take no action.
A Commerce Department recommendation last May for economic sanctions against
Baghdad was rejected.
The view of some officials in the State Department, CIA, Defence Department
and the White House was that it was still important not to isolate Iraq and
to use diplomatic pressure to moderate Mr Saddam's behaviour - a view shared
by moderate Arab states such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
Mr Sam Gejdenson, Democratic chairman of the House subcommittee, said
yesterday that the revelation of shipments to Jordan confirmed earlier
Congressional testimony by Mr Dennis Kloske, a senior Commerce Department
official.
'This is a continuation of a pattern in which the administration continued
to do business with Iraq despite every indication that they had lost
influence. I think it is clear the administration did not take action to
prevent the shipments to Iraq,' Mr Gejdenson said. Democrats had criticised
administration policy towards Iraq as a miscalculation bordering on
appeasement. Their attacks largely evaporated after the allied victory in
the Gulf war but a fresh head of steam may be gathering.
New evidence is also emerging about the extent to which the US - along with
France, Germany and other western countries - armed Iraq in the 1980s.
Congressional committees have recently been told that the government
approved 771 licences of high-technology items and biological agents to Iraq
between 1985-90 worth Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 839m).
The weapons flow was part of a pro-Baghdad tilt by Washington against Tehran
which continued well after the end of the Iran-Iraq war in August, 1988.
During the summer of 1990, the Commerce Department became alarmed at the
stream of applications from US companies for export licences for dual-use
technology.
Mr Kloske told the committee last week that he ordered officials to tie up
the licence applications in red tape - a rare and controversial admission
since Congress constantly complains about unnecessary restrictions on US
exports. Mr Kloske, who intends to leave the administration, was singled out
for criticism by the White House which denied reports that he was sacked for
talking to Congress.

FT  17 APR 91 / Allied troops sent to aid Kurds: US, British, French forces
to set up safe zones in northern Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TROOPS FROM Britain, the US and France are to set up protective zones in
northern Iraq as part of a greatly expanded aid effort for Kurdish refugees
announced last night by President George Bush.
Warning that he expected Iraq not to interfere, Mr Bush said the presence of
the troops - who would be given air cover - would allow easier distribution
of food, medicine and clothing.
Mr Bush's announcement, sharply reversing previously stated policy, came
after a day of intense diplomatic activity involving Mr John Major, United
Nations officials and representatives of other allies in the war against
Iraq. His decision was taken after consultation with Britain, France,
Germany and Turkey.
The president said the refugee sites would be turned over as soon as
possible to the United Nations. Stressing that the US had no intention of
occupying Iraqi territory or becoming involved in its domestic turmoil, he
vowed that the US would not get sucked into 'another Vietnam-style
quagmire'.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the teams would move
'in and out for short periods of time - I mean hours' to help build camps,
transport refugees or distribute food and water. They would not be involved
in any military action.
The UK government said last night that British troops would be helping to
meet 'the urgent humanitarian needs' of the refugees fleeing the troops of
President Saddam Hussein.
In London, the US decision was hailed as a vindication of Mr Major's
initiative at last week's European Community summit in Luxembourg to create
'safe havens' in Iraq for the Kurds. The move was endorsed by other EC
leaders.
Details on the number of troops to be deployed, not immediately available
last night, seemed likely to emerge today. British officials stressed that
the deployment did not represent a direct military intervention in Iraq's
civil war.
The expectation was that the British forces would be relatively few, but one
senior official said there might have to be a significant commitment of 'air
cover' to guarantee the safety of troops on the ground.
Mr Major said: 'We expect the Iraqi government to co-operate with this
further measure to ensure the effective implementation of resolution 688 and
with the (UN) secretary general's efforts for the refugees.'
There are an estimated 600,000 Iraqi refugees on the Turkish border. About
400,000 are inside Turkey, and 1m on Iraq's border with Iran. Mr Bush said
that in spite of a massive relief campaign by western and other humanitarian
groups, the efforts had so far failed. The objective was to bring the Kurds
down from the mountainous regions where they had congregated along Iraq's
northern border with Turkey and Iran.
'If we cannot get adequate food, clothing and shelter to the Kurds living in
the mountains, then we must encourage the Kurds to move to an area in
northern Iraq where the geography facilitates . . . such a large scale
relief effort,' the president said.
President Bush has repeatedly said his first objective, now that Kuwait's
sovereignty has been restored, is to 'bring the kids home.' However, an
outcry over the refugee problem has caused him to mount a massive relief
operation.
About 8,300 Americans - mostly military personnel - are already deployed in
Turkey in support of a relief effort which the White House says is perhaps
the largest in history. The troops are providing air and land
transportation, medical, engineering assistance and water purification.
At a news conference after his announcement, Mr Bush raised the possibility
of exile for the Iraqi leader in a third country where he would not be
hunted down for war crimes. It was 'important to the tranquility of Iraq' to
remove him.

FT  17 APR 91 / Output price rise upsets markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP reminder for the government that underlying inflation remains a
problem came yesterday with a further big increase in the price index for UK
manufactured goods last month.
The Central Statistical Office said the price index of goods at the factory
gate rose 0.7 per cent between February and March and was 6.3 per cent
higher than in March last year.
Output prices have now risen at an annual rate of 6.3 per cent in the first
three months of this year.
Treasury officials said the figures justified the government's caution in
cutting bank base rates by half a point at a time in spite of sterling's
strength in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.
News of the March producer price rise contributed to a fall in London share
prices, which early yesterday had reached a new trading high. Investors
reckoned that this would reduce the likelihood of an early cut in bank base
rates from the 12 per cent level set last Friday.
However, there were some grounds for optimism in the output price figures.
Much of the monthly increase reflected higher prices for food, drink and
tobacco following the March Budget increases in excise duties.
After excluding these elements from the index, the annual rate of output
price inflation dropped to 6.4 per cent last month from 6.6 per cent in
February. The CSO also revised downwards the February rate of factory gate
inflation from the provisional 6.7 per cent reported last month. The
Treasury described this development as 'mildly encouraging'.
According to Mr Peter Spencer, chief UK economist at Shearson Lehman
Brothers in London, yesterday's figures could be 'a first little sign' that
output price inflation is easing.
Such a change of trend has been expected because recent industrial trends
surveys from the Confederation of British Industry have suggested that fewer
UK manufacturers are planning price increases because of the recession.
Mr Christopher Johnson, group economic adviser of Lloyds Bank, suggested
that the UK's comparatively high level of producer price inflation could be
recession-linked. It reflected high unit labour costs caused by earnings
rising quite sharply at a time of falling production. 'Some companies are
putting up prices to remain solvent,' he said.
Other government figures released yesterday show continuing depressed fuel
and raw materials prices. The input price index rose by 0.2 per cent between
February and March as higher prices for metals and home-produced food
manufacturing materials were nearly offset by a seasonal fall in electricity
costs. Input prices last month were 2.5 per cent lower than in March last
year, compared with an annual drop of 2.2 per cent in February.
However, on a seasonally adjusted basis, input prices rose by 0.6 per cent
last month against a fall of 0.7 per cent in February.

FT  17 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: SmithKline rises on drug sales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham put in a good performance in the wake of presentations to
analysts in London and New York. The gain was at the expense of Glaxo
because much of the discussion with the analysts concerned patents on
money-spinning drugs where worries have hit both stocks in recent weeks.
Analysts heard how the expiry of the patent on SmithKline's best seller
Tagamet would be compensated for by the sales of two new drugs: Seroxat, an
anti-depressant drug, and Augmentin, an antibiotic.
SmithKline hinted that sales of Seroxat would pass Pounds 1bn a year - an
unofficial definition of a blockbuster drug - later in the decade, while
Augmentin would be a bigger seller than Tagamet within two years.
SmithKline gained 9 to 818p on steady turnover of 1.6m. Traders noted
switching out of Glaxo, down 15 to 1085p on 2.1m.
Hanson active
Turnover in Hanson leapt to 21m in the wake of the company's announcement
that it was raising Pounds 500m through an issue of a 15-year convertible
Eurobond with a 9 1/2 per cent coupon.
The news restarted speculation that the acquisitive Hanson was going to bid
for a large company. Although all suggestions were greeted with some
scepticism by traders. Hanson itself lost 5 to 220p.
Possible candidate
Among market reactions to the Hanson's fund raising was to link the news
with recent suggestions that Brent Walker could be about to divest itself of
its successful William Hill betting shops operation.
Brent Walker shares moved higher amid speculation that Hanson may be keen on
acquiring the cash-generative William Hill organisation which comprises some
1,700 betting shops throughout the UK.
Specialists were sceptical about any Hanson move on William Hill but said
there was little doubt that Brent Walker, with debt well in excess of Pounds
1bn, would be happy to sell William Hill. 'Some form of divestment from
Brent Walker seems likely in the medium term,' said one analyst.
Brent Walker acquired William Hill in the autumn of 1989 for some Pounds
685m, financed by bank borrowings. Brent Walker shares, responding to hopes
that a William Hill sale will eventually materialise, moved up to 79p before
slipping back to close a net 4 higher at 75p.
Foremost among FT-SE stocks considered vulnerable to any predatory move by
Hanson was Pilkington. Previous speculation of a possible bid from rival
conglomerate and stakeholder BTR was forgotten as Pilkington rose against
the market to touch 207p. Later they came away from the highest to close a
net 3 firmer at 205p after turnover of 4.1m shares.
Another possible Hanson candidate was said to be Allied-Lyons, which last
month suffered weakness on the disclosure of a large currency loss. Traders
were sceptical of the Hanson speculation, but Allied still rose 6 to 535p.
Only minor improvements were scored by other stocks thought likely to
attract the attention of Lord Hanson. Hawker Siddeley weakened because it
was omitted from the list of possibles, and the shares ended 15 down at
587p.
J Sainsbury, the food retailer, dropped 11 to 379p after analysts drew
attention to the shares' recent strong performance. Since the begining of
April, Sainsbury has risen by nearly 10 per cent against a 2.5 per cent gain
by the FT-SE 100 index.
Some brokers recommended selling, while others advised switching into slower
performers such as Tesco and Argyll. There were also suggestions that the
rise in its share price may tempt bond holders to consider converting into
equity.
Mr Paul Smiddy of Kleinwort Benson said full conversion of the 1989
convertible bond would add 50m shares to circulation. Argyll was 3 lower at
316p, while Tesco was off a penny at 282p.
The near two week run in oil shares was brought to a halt by a bout of minor
profit-taking triggered by the general decline in UK markets and the initial
fall in US equities. Turnover, although well below recent enhanced levels,
remained keen as a small rise crude oil prices prompted the emergence of a
number of buyers at the close.
Ultramar was a notable weak spot, the shares sliding 9 to 323p after a
number of switches out of the ordinary and into the group's convertible
stock; turnover in the ordinary reached a higher-than-usual 1.2m shares.
Lasmo outperformed the sector, touching 372p before closing a net 2 firmer
at 366p after being given a strong push by Mr David Stedman at Daiwa, the
Japanese-owned securities house. Mr Stedman described Lasmo shares as
'undervalued and overlooked,' and said Lasmo was looking at rising
production - breaking through the 100,000 barrels a day mark in 1992. He
focused on Lasmo's big drilling programme in the next six months and pointed
out Lasmo's 24 per cent underperformance of the market since the beginning
of the year.
Legal &amp; General dipped 5 to 465p in front of today's new business figures
for the first quarter. These, analysts said, are expected to show a drop of
between 10 and 15 per cent on the same period last year.
A technical correction of the stock's outperformance over the past four
weeks - 7 1/2 per cent against the wider market - left Rolls-Royce 7 lower
at 170p. The situation was brought on, according to traders, by two sizeable
sellers not handling their business too well and pushing marketmakers into
passing stock around the market as they adjusted book positions.
Regional brewer J A Devenish outshone the leading stocks, rising 10 on
persistent buying interest to achieve the best level this year of 204p.
Smith New Court, the investment house, has favourably rated the company
since hosting a presentation back in January.
The software stocks held the limelight in electronics. Sema extended their
recent steep decline, closing a further 14 off at 335p with the market still
expecting Cap Gemini Sogeti to sell its badly-performing 27.4 per cent stake
and launch a bid for one of the other software groups. SD-Scicon, long
spoken of as a bid target, edged higher to 37p.
Among the other software issues a comprehensive review of the sector by Ms
Tressan Macarthy at Panmure Gordon highlighted the attractions of Sage,
Macro 4, Misys and Sherwood Computer. Sage jumped 16 to 252p with the 'new'
shares 16 1/2 up at 50 1/2 p. Misys continued to move higher, adding 9 to
124p. Sherwood raced up 15 to 137p.
Talk linking TI Group, 531p, with fellow engineering group Siebe, 423p,
unsettled sentiment in both and the shares lost 6 and 11 respectively.
Mannesmann, the big German engineering company, holds more than 7 per cent
of TI Group, and has admitted its desire to tackle a 'large to very large
project.'
Marks and Spencer, a strong performer since the begining of April, slipped
back 5 to 258p as 4.4m shares changed hands on renewed suggestions of weak
food sales.
Caird Group, the waste management company which suffered several traumas in
1990, traded briskly as investors interpreted confidently the news that
several main board directors, including the chief executive Mr Peter
Linacre, had increased their holdings.
The stock rose to 67p before settling 7 up on the session at 65p. Turnover
was heavy at 2.4m shares. Severn Trent Water holds a near-30 per cent stake
after allowing a conditional bid of 100p per share for Caird to lapse last
year.
Smaller-priced and USM-listed Porth advanced 3 more to 14p on continued
hopes that Sir Michael Edwardes, the former head of British Leyland, will
become chairman of the company.

FT  17 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JUNE FT-SE futures contract made one last futile attempt yesterday at
testing 2,600 before the weight of sellers proved too much and it slumped
back below 2,550.
A surprisingly strong overnight close on Wall Street initially left floor
traders on the London International Financial Futures Exchange short and
prices were marked higher with June FT-SE hitting 2,592 at one stage.
But a sell note from UBS Phillips and Drew encouraged a bout of profit
taking and, with little support from the cash market, equity futures quickly
gave up their gains, dragging the stock market lower in the process.
At one stage June FT-SE was trading just 20 points above the spot index,
compared with the 30 point premium which brokers' calculate is necessary to
take account of future dividend payments and the cost of finance.
June FT-SE closed at 2,549, down 27. In after hours dealing it slipped to
2,542.
Hanson puts were bought and calls sold as investors who had taken up the
Pounds 500m bond issue hedged themselves. Speculation that Hanson may use
the extra cash to bid for either Pilkington or Trafalgar House triggered
busy trade in their options.
Cadbury Schweppes was lifted by selling of August 420 calls and buying of
390 puts.

FT  17 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt holds its ground as
other bourses decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES mostly fell yesterday, for a variety of reasons, while Frankfurt
seemed to surprise itself by registering a new closing high for 1991, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw particular strength in the big three chemicals, in utilities
and in the tyre company Continental as share prices generally held their
ground. The FAZ index rose 0.11 to 680.39 at midsession and the DAX by 1.94
to 1,603.36 at the close.
Volume rose again, from DM6.0bn to DM6.5bn. The top ten active stocks
included the chemicals, Veba and RWE in utilities and Conti, which traded in
DM400m as it rose DM6.50 to DM224.50.
Mr Detlev Klug of B Metzler in Frankfurt said that the Conti buyer had
managed to remain invisible during market hours; a number of dealers will be
pursuing the story today, sensitive to stakebuilding possibilities with a
merger offer from Pirelli still extant.
BASF led chemicals higher with a rise of DM4.70 to DM247. Opinions have been
divided on the big three's ability, and inclination to maintain dividends
which yield around 8 per cent to German shareholders.
In utilities, also regarded as defensive, Veba rose DM5.70 to DM339, and was
fourth in the volume chart in turnover of DM405m on a Dresdner Bank
recommendation, RWE following in DM265m with a rise of DM5.50 to DM408.
PARIS was pulled down to its lowest close this month by Wall Street's weak
opening. The CAC 40 index ended down 1.07 per cent or 19.44 at 1,802.91 in
volume of FFr1.7bn.
Michelin and Peugeot were both weaker ahead of their 1990 results which are
due to be released today. Analysts, meanwhile, were intent on 1991
prospects. The tyre manufacturer fell FFr2 or 2.2 per cent to FFr88.20 with
181,150 shares traded while the car company lost FFr22 or 3.9 per cent to
FFr536 in 114,925.
BNP, whose long-term debt was put on Standard &amp; Poor's creditwatch list last
Friday, fell 3.6 per cent or FFr10.50 to FFr279.50.
MILAN fell on the final day of the April trading account as professionals,
who had speculated on a firm close to the trading month, squared their
positions. The Comit index fell 3.88 to 587.66 in volume estimated at
slightly more than Monday's L161bn.
Fiat fell L104 or 1.8 per cent to L5,528, weighed down by options-related
selling and renewed fears that difficult trading conditions so far this year
might force it to cut its dividend on 1990 results.
Shares controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti remained weak, with Cir down L65
or 2.5 per cent to L2,550 and Olivetti off L100 to L3,830.
On the other hand, the insurance sector resisted the weaker trend with some
success. Generali lost only L80 to L36,900. Sai and Toro bucked the trend,
closing up L290 or 1.6 per cent and L460 or 1.7 per cent at L18,500 and
L26,710 respectively.
AMSTERDAM came off the day's highs as Wall Street opened lower. Trading was
thin ahead of the Bundesbank's meeting on Thursday. There were fears that
the Dutch would have to follow suit if Germany raised its interest rates.
The CBS tendency index, having set a 1991 closing high of 97.1 on Monday,
lost 0.6 to close at 96.5 yesterday.
Royal Dutch eased Fl 1.20 to Fl 153.40 after Monday's surge, while Unilever,
which reached an all-time high on Monday, fell Fl 3.60 to Fl 163.30.
ZURICH fell 1.2 per cent after its holiday on Monday, featuring
profit-taking in pharmaceuticals, and acrobatics in the arms and engineering
concern Oerlikon-Buhrle.
The Credit Suisse index closed 6.7 lower at 554.3, Roche bearers easing
SFr30 to SFr7,490 on higher profits and dividend for 1990, and Ciba-Geigy
losing SFr130 to SFr2,740 on Friday's news that its first-quarter sales
dropped 8 per cent, and that 1991 will be a difficult year.
Oerlikon, also on Friday, offered a swap from non-voting certificates into
bearer shares on a five-for-two basis. The certificates jumped SFr56, or
more than a third yesterday to SFr196, while the bearers shed SFr10 to
SFr510.
STOCKHOLM fell on higher domestic interest rates. The Affarsvarlden general
index fell 5.9 to 1,092.9 in volume of SKr289m after SKr235m. The day's most
heavily traded share was energy group Sydkraft's C share which fell SKr1 to
SKr120 in volume of SKr24m. Heavy trade was also noted in Trelleborg, the
free B shares rising SKr1 to SKr139.
BRUSSELS saw shares in Societe Generale de Belgique lose BFr30 to BFr2,240
after reporting 1990 results at the lower end of expectations. The Bel 20
index rose 1.33 to 1,209.40.

FT  17 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Reports of easier credit
prompt late rally
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices surged in the last 15 minutes of trading, on reports that the
central bank was loosening its monetary policy. Bond and futures markets
were also stronger, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed up 117.77 at 26,813.30 as dealers scrambled to
cover their positions. The index rose to the day's high of 26,894.27 on
index buying in the morning but fell into negative territory in the
afternoon, hitting the day's low of 26,615.35.
Volume remained subdued at 380m shares. Gainers led losers by 499 to 467,
with 180 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 6.77 to
2,018.83 and, in London trading, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.34 to
1,520.8.
Reports quoted a Bank of Japan source who said that monetary policy had
shifted from tight to neutral, and that the central bank intended to lower
overnight call rates, which have been kept at 8.3 per cent since
mid-February, to around 8 per cent.
The yield on the 10-year 129 benchmark bond eased 0.095 percentage points to
6.625, and June stock futures closed up 130 points at 27,380, 0.7 per cent
above theoretical value.
Miss Caroline Stone at Barclays de Zoete Wedd said that sentiment improved
during the last few minutes of trading, and that today should attract strong
buying.
Interest rate-sensitive issues were sought in the last-minute rush, and
large capital issues climbed in active trading. Nippon Steel, the most
active issue of the day, added Y10 to Y495, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
gained Y7 to Y803, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Y6 to Y639.
Oil shares were strong on the back of rising oil prices after the World Bank
forecast of a significant decline in Soviet oil output. Nippon Oil gained
Y50 to Y1,140 and Mitsubishi Oil added Y30 to Y1,200.
Trading companies, which had been popular recently because of their ties
with the Soviet Union, lost ground. Brokers had encouraged investors to buy
Soviet-related stocks ahead of President Mikhail Gorbachev's visit which
started yesterday, but concerns over the domestic situation in the Soviet
Union prompted profit-taking. Mitsui lost Y9 to Y827.
Fuji Electric, an electric machinery maker, rose Y13 to Y890 on expectations
of increased capital spending by electric power companies. Kyudenko, an
electrical engineering company, rose Y60 to Y2,220 on similar hopes.
The warm weather lifted apparel shares. Renown Look climbed Y70 to Y1,780,
and Naigai climbed Y80 to Y1,350.
In Osaka the OSE average added 62.96 to 30,057.50 on low volume of 31.4m
shares. Large capitals lost ground on profit-taking, and investors focused
on short-term trading in secondary shares.
Murata, a ceramic capacitor maker, rose Y40 to Y2,680 on news that it
planned to start mass-production of electrical parts, with projected annual
sales of Y7bn.
Roundup
POLITICAL fears in Taiwan produced the most outstanding feature in a region
marked by profit-taking yesterday. Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta were
closed for public holidays.
TAIWAN fell by 6.3 per cent as the weighted index suffered the year's
largest single-day decline to close 358.14 lower at 5,313.31. Turnover fell
from TDollars 84.6bn to TDollars 78.4bn.
All eight deputies of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party withdrew
on Monday from a three-week extraordinary session of the National Assembly
on constitutional changes and vowed to take to the streets to demonstrate
for faster democratic reforms. However, analysts also said that there was
profit-taking following a six-day rally which had pushed the index up by
326.61.
MANILA blamed profit-taking for a 5.44 fall in the composite index to
1,090.46 after two days of gains.
Dealers said that stocks were hitting resistance levels, citing the case of
Philippine National Bank. PNB reached a high of 400 pesos a share, but once
it touched this mark 25 brokers came in as sellers, compared with eight
buyers at 397.50 pesos. PNB closed up 12.50 pesos at 397.50 pesos.
BANGKOK had its own political worries as fears of protests against
legislation disbanding labour unions at state enterprises came in to weaken
an early rally. The SET index closed just 1.37 higher at 886.03 after an
early gain of about 8 points. Turnover was 3.84bn baht.
AUSTRALIA, on the other hand, took in its stride the first bond tender in
almost two years and a government announcement that Australian workers will
get an immediate 2.5 per cent wage increase under the country's centralised
wage fixing system. Strategists said that the latter announcement had little
in the way of inflationary implications.
The All Ordinaries index added 9.0 to 1,471.7, its fourth consecutive rise,
stiffened by a good performance in industrials. Turnover rose from ADollars
141m to ADollars 164m.
Coles Myer, the nation's biggest retailer, rose 8 cents to ADollars 9.84
following a 24 cent rise on Monday. It has applied to the Australian Stock
Exchange to lift its weighting on the All Ordinaries index. Brokers said
that this had helped drive the shares up, because investors in index-linked
funds might have to increase their holdings.
NEW ZEALAND closed with the Barclays index 10.24 lower at 1,425.65 on
profit-taking after an advance of 8.1 per cent in the previous ten sessions.
Turnover stayed high, rising from NZDollars 25.3m to NZDollars 30.8m, as
dealers said that a climb in the New Zealand dollar against its Australian
counterpart had also tended to dampen buying of issues which were also
traded in Australia.

FT  17 APR 91 / Money Markets: No tightening yet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS no indication of further tightening by the German Bundesbank when
it set the terms for this week's securities repurchase agreement tender.
The central bank tightened a notch last week, when offering one-month money
at a fixed 8.60 per cent, compared with 8.50 previously, but yesterday the
Bundesbank renewed its offer of 28-day funds at 8.60 per cent. This led
observers to believe that a rise in official rates at tomorrow's Bundesbank
council meeting is unlikely.
At this week's tender banks are invited to bid for one-month fixed rate
money and for 63-day funds at variable bid rates. This will be required to
replace a total of DM25.1bn draining from the money market today as two
earlier facilities expire.
Call money was slightly firmer in Frankfurt, rising to 8.85 from 8.80 per
cent.
In London wholesale interest rates were little changed. Three-month sterling
interbank was unchanged at 11 29/32 -11 27/32 per cent and 12-month money
was steady at 11 1/2 -11 3/8 per cent.
Short sterling futures also showed little movement on Liffe. June opened
weaker at 88.64 and touched a low of 88.63, before closing at 88.66 compared
with 88.67 previously. This discounts a three-month interbank cash rate of
11 11/32 at delivery.
On the cash market the Bank of England initially forecast a day-to-day
credit shortage of Pounds 600m, but revised this to Pounds 700m during the
morning and to Pounds 650m in the afternoon. Total help of Pounds 498m was
provided.
Before lunch the authorities bought Pounds 323m bills outright, by way of
Pounds 4m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 319m bank bills
in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon another Pounds 175m bank
bills were purchased in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 254m, with exchequer transactions absorbing
Pounds 510m. These outweighed a fall in the note circulation adding Pounds
90m to liquidity and bank balances below target of Pounds 75m.
In Paris the Bank of France left its money market intervention rate at 9 per
cent and the five to 10-day repurchase rate at 10 per cent when adding
liquidity to the banking system via a securities repurchase tender.

FT  17 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar and sterling lose ground
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR weakened against most European currencies, but was little changed
against sterling and improved in terms of the yen yesterday.
The Federal Reserve, as expected, added funds to the New York banking
system, via two-day system repurchase agreements, when Federal funds were
trading at 6 3/16 per cent. Tax payments contributed to a tightening of
credit conditions in New York, pushing the Fed funds rate above the assumed
target of 6 per cent, after a period of recent weakness and action by the
authorities to drain liquidity.
Figures on US housing starts and industrial production in March painted a
conflicting picture of the economy and had little impact. Construction of
homes fell 9.3 per cent in March, after a revised drop of 17.2 per cent in
February. This was weaker than expected.
A fall of 0.3 per cent in industrial production, compared with a 0.9 per
cent decline in February, was smaller than generally forecast. Capacity
utilisation was running at 78.7 per cent in March, against 79.1 per cent the
previous month.
The data did little to indicate when or if the Fed will ease its monetary
stance after recent weak inflation and employment figures.
At the London close the dollar had fallen to DM1.6650 from DM1.6755; to
SFr1.4175 from SFr1.4230; and to FFr5.6275 from FFr5.6550, but rose to
Y134.80 from Y134.45. Its index rose to 64.5 from 64.3.
Despite concern about the economic situation in east Germany and political
unrest in the Soviet Union, the D-Mark was firmer, encouraged by doubts on
the timing of any Fed easing, speculation about lower Japanese interest
rates and profit-taking in sterling.
The German currency rose to Y80.95 from Y80.25 against the yen, boosted by a
claim from a Japanese news agency that the Bank of Japan is about to nudge
short-term rates lower. A Bank of Japan official responded by saying: 'We
haven't been tightening money rates, and so there is no way we could ease,'
but the yen weakened, with the dollar rising above Y135.00 in Tokyo.
Sterling fell back on profit-taking, after failing to break through DM3.00
against the D-Mark on Monday, but itremained the second strongest member of
the European exchange rate mechanism. The pound declined to DM2.9775 from
DM2.9975. It also fell to FFr10.0650 from FFr10.1150 and to SFr2.5350 from
SFr2.5450, but was steady against the dollar, easing 5 points to Dollars
1.7885. Sterling's index lost 0.4 to 92.9.
The Spanish peseta eased slightly at the top of the ERM and was fixed in
Paris below its ceiling against the French franc for the first time in 10
days. A news agency report quoted a Bank of Spain spokesman as saying all
remaining exchange controls will be scrapped ahead of a 1993 deadline set by
the European Community.

FT  17 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: CPRE joins lobby to pay farmers
for environmental protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Agriculture Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORT for changes in the EC's Common Agricultural Policy, which would pay
farmers to protect the environment, is coming from apparently opposed UK
lobby groups.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England, Britain's largest
independent conservation body, is canvassing a concept of environmental land
management launched originally by the Country Landowners' Association two
years ago. Under both the CLA and the CPRE schemes, farmers would be paid
directly for using farming methods and management techniques which enhance
the landscape and countryside environment.
CPRE support for the CLA ideas comes in documents published before
tomorrow's annual UK parliamentary debate on agriculture, although it is set
in the wider context of the reform of the CAP. CPRE goes further than CLA by
suggesting 'that the bulk of public money paid to the farmers should be tied
to the provision of specific environmental benefits, rather than, as at
present, the production of food . . . Such direct payments should eventually
come to replace price-support mechanisms.'
The CLA scheme is set in a private enterprise context with farmers and
landowners contracting with governments or local authorities to provide
specific environmental benefits, such as greater access to the countryside
or the management of areas of special beauty.
The two schemes are among many ideas currently being debated on the future
of European farming.
At the centre of the debate are the EC Commission's own proposals to shift
the burden of subsidies from large food producers to small farmers across
Europe. The proposals have so far been opposed by Britain in particular.
CPRE, 25 Buckingham Palace Road, London SW1 WOPP.
Total income from UK farming fell by 6.7 per cent to Pounds 2.1bn in 1990,
the Ministry of Agriculture said in an annual report on farm incomes. This
compares with a 21 per cent increase in 1989.
Falling incomes from cattle, sheep and dairy outweighed a recovery by
specialist cereal, general cropping and intensive livestock farmers.

FT  17 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sri Lanka beats India as top
tea exporter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   COLOMBO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SRI LANKA beat India to become the world's biggest tea exporter in 1990,
exporting 216m kg of tea compared with Indian exports of slightly less than
206m kg, writes Mervyn de Silva in Colombo.
The local tea trade attributes Sri Lanka's performance to a substantial rise
in sales to Jordan, in spite of the disruption of shipping to the Middle
East, which accounted for 26m kg more in 1990 than in 1989.
Sri Lanka also maintained regular supplies to Iran and the United Arab
Emirates. Sri Lankan tea exports to Iran nearly doubled while Indian tea
sales dropped sharply. The Soviet Union also continued to be a substantial
buyer.
Tea production last year at 240m kg compared with the previous record of
229m kg in 1965. The sharp increase in the production of 'low grown' teas
(teas grown below 2,000 feet) was an important feature, according to the Sri
Lankan tea commissioner.

   EXTREME TIGHTNESS on the London Metal Exchange zinc market eased
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
but only slightly - yesterday after the arrival of 14,675 tonnes of the
metal into LME warehouses was reported.
This brings total LME stocks to 83,125 tonnes, their highest level for 15
months.
The premium for metal for immediate delivery compared with zinc for delivery
in three months (the backwardation) increased to Dollars 224.50 a tonne by
the close, compared with Dollars 217 on Monday.
But the cost of borrowing cash zinc for one day settled just below Dollars
20 a tonne compared with Dollars 60 reached at one stage on Monday.
LME executives had known for some time that a technical squeeze on the zinc
market was looming, were in touch with the principal parties involved and
preferred to use diplomatic pressure, rather than overt interference, to
maintain an orderly market, traders and analysts suggested.
The LME had been probing people's intentions and ability to meet commitments
and was satisfied events could be allowed to take their course. However, an
unexpected element of panic entered dealings on Monday afternoon when
Dollars 60 a tonne was being paid to borrow cash zinc for one day.
This took the executive by surprise because it had assurances from
Metallgesellschaft and its clients would ensure the market was kept liquid.
The German group's UK trading subsidiary has a number of clients which have
built up large holdings of zinc to cover disruptions in supplies.
'With the best will in the world, sometimes these situations get out of
hand,' a trader said. The fact that the premium to borrow cash zinc for one
day fell back below Dollars 20 a tonne yesterday showed that enough metal
was being made available at a reasonable cost, traders said.
In December 1989, when a squeeze on the market threatened to widen the daily
premium sharply, the LME executive imposed a limit of Dollars 20 a tonne on
the daily backwardation. Analysts defending the executive's decision not to
act this week pointed out that action would have brought protests about
interference with free market forces. 'They're damned if they do and damned
if they don't,' said one.
Zinc for immediate delivery was Dollars 1,425 a tonne (down Dollars 5) at
the close last night while metal for delivery in three months was Dollars
1,200.50 (down Dollars 13).

FT  17 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farming in Tunisia faces a long
drag - Francis Ghiles reports on a country struggling to boost output from
its arid land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Gulf war has brought about a collapse in what, for many years, has been
Tunisia's main source of foreign income - tourism. More than any event in
the past 20 years, this conflict has brought home to Tunisian leaders the
considerable challenge they face as they try to boost output from the land.
A much bolder policy is needed than has been pursued so far. First, the
country needs to improve the food trade balance. Domestic production covers,
on average, only two thirds of requirements. Food demand will increase by
between 30 per cent and 50 per cent by the year 2000 as the population grows
with the rise in living standards.
The average volume and cost of cereal imports has trebled since 1970. In
years of drought, they account for half the food import bill.
It also needs to improve export earnings. Fish and shellfish have made a
growing contribution, although signs of overfishing are increasingly
worrying the authorities.
The output of olive oil has declined by a sixth since 1970 to an average of
100,000 tonnes a year. Yet this sector plays an important role in three
respects - olive trees are the best means of preventing land erosion, they
provide a fifth of all employment on the land, and they contribute a third
of the value of food exports.
Second, the country needs to slow internal migration from the countryside.
Not only do farm hands earn a quarter of what civil servants do but two
thirds only find work 80 days every year, and even that is not guaranteed in
years of drought.
Although a third farmers have non-farming sources of income, life on the
land is hard.
The neglect of farming outside the rich orange groves of the Cap Bon region
in the north-east explains the high rate of illiteracy on the land (75 per
cent) as it does the ing lack of access roads. As it is, the network of main
roads in Tunisia is regarded as a national disgrace.
Third, Tunisia needs to halt land erosion and make much better use of scarce
water resources. Much of the underground water reserves are already being
tapped, but 85 per cent of surface water is lost. This is equivalent to 1bn
cubic metres of water, which could irrigate 200,000 hectares and produce up
to 1m tons of wheat, roughly what Tunisia imports every year.
As the farming sector uses 82 per cent of all water, popularising more
efficient ways of using water is essential. However, the failure of a recent
joint World Bank-EC attempt to rehabilitate the country's irrigated lands
does not augur well. It does not come as a surprise if one considers that
the price farmers pay for water covers a quarter of costs.
The IMF-induced reforms aimed at liberalising the management of Tunisia's
economy, which followed the 1986 balance of payments crisis, have brought
many changes. Prices paid to producers have increased by 40 per cent on
average, although many farmers are not benefiting much as wholesalers have
pocketed the difference.
Cost of inputs has also increased - fertilisers by 72-109 per cent, seeds by
a more modest 11-16 per cent. More worryingly, however, the price of farm
machines has doubled, spurred by the fall in the value of the dinar. Coming
at the same time as two years of severe drought in 1988-99, this has reduced
the capacity of farmers to finance investments from their own funds, which
account for only 15 per cent of all investment in agriculture.
Until the departure of the former president, Mr Habib Bourguiba, in 1987,
the poorer western and southern regions were at best forgotten. Since then,
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has started to grapple with the fact that,
however difficult it might prove politically to redistribute wealth from the
towns to the countryside, the future economic and political stability of the
country calls for a bold policy.
Signs of greater interest abound. West of Gafsa, Mr Mohamed Ben Rejeb
displays with considerable pride the 1,000-hectare Segdoud project on which
miners from the nearby Metlaoui phosphate mines are being resettled on 1.5-6
hectare lots where date palms, pomegranate and apricot trees, not to mention
vegetables, are being grown.
In spite of the arid appearance of the country, Mr Ben Rejeb says there is a
surprising abundance of water near the surface in the area.
Further north, on the vast cereal plains which surround the stronghold of El
Kef, the governor, Mr Moncef Balti, himself an agricultural engineer
seconded by an imaginative head of farming, Mr Amor Mtimet, is promoting
efforts to build small earthenware dams to halt erosion.
He is concerned by the many absentee landlords who let their land lie fallow
every other year. The Minister of Agriculture, Mr Mouldi Zouaoui, accepts
that such practices must be penalised but he who wishes to change the habit
of channelling profits from the land into property speculation in towns will
have to be both adroit and enjoy strong backing from the head of state if he
is to stand a chance of success.
Low productivity also characterises much state-owned land. These lands may
account for only 5 per cent of arable land overall but they are concentrated
in the richest cereal areas. The government is beginning to sell them,
although it is aware of the need to avoid further fragmentation of property.
A recent, and promising, development is the setting up of joint companies to
manage such domains with foreign investors on the basis of long leases -
recent examples include a Swiss company to grow flowers and a Swedish
company to grow vegetables. Such ventures have the advantage of providing
know-how to Tunisia and ensuring access to foreign markets.
The authorities, however, are wary of repeating the costly mistakes of the
1980s when joint ventures of this kind with Gulf and Saudi funds led to
widespread corruption and extravagant schemes described by one expert as a
'policy of importing Rolls-Royces in lieu of Peugeots'.
Two further issues will have to be addressed if Tunisia is one day to have a
real farming policy. The first concerns the allocation of credit, for which
only a fifth of farmers are eligible. Farmers are going to have to learn
that credit does not amount to handouts.
Conversely, bankers whose role is deemed to include promoting farming will
have to get out of their offices and learn what risk is all about - a change
of mentality which many may find hard but which is all the more necessary in
a country whose erratic climate makes farming more risky than industry.
There is also the vexed matter of how decisions are reached at the Ministry
of Agriculture. Politics often play a greater part than economics. Many
people in the field argue that the ministry's 3,000 civil servants
constitute the greatest threat of all to the modernisation of Tunisian
farming.

Dollars 500m

<TEXT>
PERU expects to sign oil contracts worth Dollars 500m (Pounds 279m) this
year with foreign investors, according to Mr Fernando Sanchez Albavera,
mines and energy minister.
At the opening of Peru's 20th annual convention of mining engineers in Lima
on Monday night, the minister said that exploration contracts with Texas
Crude and American Petroleum would be signed within days. He also hinted
that half a dozen other important oil investments were upcoming.
Negotiations over the development of the large Camisea gas and hydrocarbon
deposits in the central jungle were 'coming along well', he said.
Mr Sanchez Albavera also revealed that Inter-American Development Bank
financing for Dollars 140m to rehabilitate Peru's state-owned mining and
refining company, Centromin, was 'all but approved'. Mr Enrique Iglesias,
IADB president, considered it the Bank's 'star project', the minister said.
Other government priority investments include Dollars 60m for the high-grade
Tintaya copper mine, now transferred from the state to the Cuzco regional
government; the modernisation of HierroPeru, the state-owned iron concern;
and the expansion of the zinc refinery at Cajamarquilla, which requires
Dollars 60m funding in its first stage.
The state will no longer invest in mining projects, according to the
minister, but become instead a 'promoter of new private sector investments'.
Large modifications to Peru's mining laws and the recent ratification by
Congress of the World Bank-organised multilateral investment guarantee
agreement (MIGA) would also encourage foreign investments, he said.

FT  17 APR 91 / Jobs: Dismal market still offers some hope of upturn from
bottom towards end of year - Executive demand plummets to record low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'OH TO be in England now that April's there.' If the poet Browning were
alive today, and happened to be a job-seeking manager, those famous words
would not have been called forth by the beauties of brush-wood sheafs,
elm-tree boles and what not. He'd have written them simply out of relief
that January, February and March are over.
Never in the 32 years the MSL International consultancy has been keeping
count of executive jobs advertised in leading British journals, has a first
quarter's demand plumbed such depths.
The handiest indicator of the drop is MSL's index standardised on 1959
market levels as 100. The figure for the three months just ended was 79. The
previous lowest for a January-March period - which normally sees the best
demand in the calendar year - was the 93 recorded two recessions back in
1976.
More recent comparisons are summarised in the table alongside giving the
tallies for the past five 12-monthly periods ended on March 31. The figures
represent specific jobs, each that comes on the market counting as one no
matter how many times it is advertised.
The quarter-by-quarter results are shown by the four bottom lines. As may be
seen, the last three quarters have successively produced the lowest tallies
since 1986, the one for January-March being not much more than half the
count for the first quarter of 1990.
The upper part of the table gives the whole 12-monthly periods' figures,
breaking them down into eight kinds of managerial and upper ranked
specialist work ('others' include people such as buyers, economists, company
legal staff and variegated consultants). Suffice it to say that not since
1988-89 has any of the eight shown an improvement on the previous 12-monthly
tally, the only one with a single-digit percentage fall in 1990-91 being the
more senior general management group.
There is similarly gloomy news, too, in the consultancy's separate counts of
jobs advertised by four broad industries. In the latest 12 months,
high-technology companies offered 1,743 posts, down by almost 23 per cent on
1989-90 and by nearly 57 per cent from the 4,009 peak the year before.
Retailing's 647 tally was a good 25 per cent down on 1989-90, and 45 per
cent on its best of 1,185 in 1986-87. Food, drink and tobacco businesses
advertised 687 jobs, a drop of almost 17 per cent from the previous 12
months and 38 per cent fewer than the 1986-87 peak of 1,185.
Energy and related companies were mercifully a bit different. True, their
latest 2,361 count was down by towards 15 per cent from the previous period,
and by 36 per cent from the highest of 3,709 in 1985-86. But at least the
most recent figure isn't the industry's worst. Indeed, it is no less than 96
per cent above the miserable 1,204 of 1986-87.
The only other good news that lurks in the figures is also of the 'has been
worse' kind, and does not show up in the table. Leaving aside the 12-monthly
results for the eight categories, and focusing on their quarterly results, I
can see two brighter spots. In both cases the January-March tallies, unlike
those for the rest of the categories, edged up on the October-December
counts.
One was general management, with an 11.2 per cent improvement on the final
quarter of last year. But it is the other, smaller gain of only 5.3 per cent
that I trust is the more significant.
For one thing, it is the second improvement of sorts in successive quarters.
For another, it is in the marketing and sales group which, since 1959, has
usually proved a lead indicator of movements in the executive market as a
whole.
So there is at least some ground for hope that overall demand will begin to
move up from its 32-year nadir in this year's final quarter, if not before.
W
HICH said, and jobs being scarce, I will turn to two on offer. In each case
the headhunters are unable to name the employer, and promise to honour
applicants' requests not to be identified to their clients at this stage.
New York is the base of the first, being offered by Theo Stegers of
Recruitment Matters (15 Great Eastern St, London EC2A 3EJ; tel 071-377 1600,
fax 071-377 1801). He seeks a manager for the Dollars 40m-turnover American
arm of a British company in business conferences, publishing and
exhibitions.
Candidates need marketing skills, especially direct mail, besides success in
profitably running an operation of at least a broadly comparable kind.
Salary around Dollars 250,000. Rest negotiable.
Conversely, the second recruit will work for an American group but be based
west of London. The job is to manage the executive-selection and assessment
activities of a consultancy in management training and development, and is
offered through Alan Rundle of Rundle Brownswood, 17 London End,
Beaconsfield, Bucks HP9 2HN; tel 0494 676264, fax 0494 670283.
Although candidates must be occupational psychologists, they also need to be
proven business-generators and skilled all-round communicators with the
ability to plan as well as motivate the efforts of a small team.
Salary plus incentive bonus around Pounds 40,000. Perks include car of BMW
520i standard.

FT  17 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: One firm's bright Chicago
future is another's gloom - Barbara Durr finds that groups too small to
survive are being bought - many of them by the Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Falling commissions, increasing costs and slimmer-than-ever profits have led
many leaders of the Chicago futures industry to predict that the number of
futures trading firms will decline in the next few years to about 150 from
the present 400.
Some of the biggest players in this realignment are expected to be Japanese.
Mr Leo Melamed, who last year retired from executive duties at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, recently sold control of his family firm, Dellsher, to
a Japanese bank, Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank (MTKB).
Mr Melamed has long predicted that large well-capitalised firms would
increasingly dominate the market, leaving small firms to go bust, sell out
or exist only as niche players. 'I was one of the firms that was going to be
extinct if I didn't take my own advice,' he said.
With 55 employees and Dollars 11m in capital, Dellsher is a small player.
MTKB says it looked at several other Chicago futures commissions and
considered the option of setting up its own in-house futures unit. It
decided on Dellsher because of the price - undisclosed - of the deal and
because of Mr Melamed's prestige.
According to Mr Tomohiko Sumihara, vice-president of business management in
New York for MTKB, some Japanese firms which began futures units in Chicago
have had trouble 'being accepted in that circle'. He believes that the
Melamed name will smooth MTKB's path. Purchasing Dellsher was also less
costly than developing its own expertise, said Mr Sumihara.
MTKB - which, with total assets of Dollars 402bn in 1990, ranks as Japan's
second largest bank - is keen to offer the full menu of services to its
clients. Last December, it formed MTK Global Capital, a derivative products
subsidiary, and Dellsher will come in handy to help lay off risks incurred
through, for example, over-the-counter currency and interest-rate swaps.
MTKB's splash into Chicago's markets is part of a steady stream of Japanese
companies and banks since 1987, when the Japanese government loosened
regulations to allow firms to trade foreign futures. The 'big four' of the
Japanese securities houses - Daiwa, Nikko, Nomura and Yamaichi - have chosen
to establish in-house futures expertise.
Nomura has adopted a strategy of head-hunting big-name New York talent and
local stars in Chicago. Unlike other firms that have kept most of their
authority in Japan, Nomura has given its US team free rein. As a result, the
Nomura futures unit has become profitable in a short time, said Mr Robert
Fitzsimmons, Nomura's Chicago chief.
The president of Nikko Securities International, Mr Masumi Yamaguchi,
explained that when his firm sought a Chicago partner, it found that small
trading firms were mostly privately held without public disclosure
statements, making an investigation of their creditworthiness and the
quality of their client base difficult.
Nikko has been an aggressive Japanese firm: it was the first to open its own
office and the first to launch a futures fund for Japanese investors. Daiwa
has also sold a futures fund for Japanese investors and says it is pleased
with its Chicago business.
Japanese futures funds are kept offshore by Japanese regulatory authorities.
But that could change due to a law under consideration in Tokyo.
If it does, Chicago is expected to attract much of that new Japanese
trading. Japan only has a limited financial futures market of Japanese
government bonds and stock index futures.
However, if regionalist trends hold, Japan's markets may develop later and
take back some of that business, according to Mr Morton Lane, president of
Discount Corporation of New York Futures.
Mr Lane expects the futures industry worldwide to divide into three main
spheres of trading - Europe, the US and Japan. Eager for experience and
expertise, Japan's role in Chicago is likely to grow.

FT  17 APR 91 / International Bonds: Hopes of currency rise spark dollar
deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE tightly-priced Eurodollar bond issues were launched in the
international bond market yesterday, hoping to attract those investors
expecting an increase in the value of the US currency.
The biggest deal of the day came from SBAB, the Swedish National Mortgage
Association, which launched a Dollars 400m six-year bond issue lead managed
by Nomura International.
The bonds carry an 8 1/2 per cent coupon, the highest of the three issues
yesterday, and were priced to yield 60 basis points above the US Treasury
bond yield curve.
SBAB is rated Triple-A by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit-rating agency,
and few other borrowers of this credit quality offer such a wide yield
spread over Treasuries. For example, Italy's six-year Eurodollar bonds trade
at a spread of about 59 basis points.
However, participants in the deal commented that the best demand for dollar
paper was at the shorter three-year to five-year maturities. The lead
manager held the deal at the fixed reoffer level until the close of trading.
At the shorter three-year maturity, Union Bank of Finland came with a
Dollars 200m deal lead managed by Morgan Stanley International.
The bonds carry an 8 per cent coupon and were reoffered to investors at the
fixed price of 99.75, where the yield spread over Treasuries is 79 basis
points.
The lead manager reported strong buying interest from institutional
investors which have until recently declined to buy paper issued by banks
and corporations. Investors switching into dollar bonds in anticipation of
currency gains were attracted by the short maturity.
However, co-managers in the deal experienced slow going and the deal was
again held at the fixed reoffer price throughout the day.
Daimler-Benz, the German industrial conglomerate, launched a Dollars 250m
five-year deal lead managed by Deutsche Bank Capital Markets. The 8 1/4 per
cent bonds were priced to yield 49 basis points over US Treasuries.
Daimler-Benz is not rated by any of the big credit-rating agencies, but is
generally regarded by investors as having triple-A credit quality and is one
of the few European companies to tap the market regularly.
In addition to institutional demand, the lead manager expected substantial
placement among German and Swiss retail accounts.
The supply of sterling bonds was maintained by Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone,
which came with a Pounds 100m 10-year issue lead managed by Warburg
Securities. On Monday, Warburg lead managed a Pounds 150m 10-year deal for
Export-Import Bank of Japan, the first Japanese issuer in the sterling
market for some years.
Yesterday's deal was priced to yield 50 basis points above the 10 per cent
UK government bond maturing 2001 - four basis points more than for Ex-Im
Bank.
The lead manager said that about 70 per cent of the issue had been placed
with UK institutions keen to gain exposure to one of the world's largest
companies.

FT  17 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Hanson Pounds 500m issue well
received
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 500m convertible capital bond issue launched yesterday by Hanson,
the UK industrial conglomerate, underlines the demand among international
investors for equity-linked paper.
The deal was by far the biggest sterling convertible bond issue to be
launched in the international market and was aimed mainly at continental
European institutional investors.
Participants reported a positive response from institutional investors.
Since the group has a market capitalisation of Pounds 10.5bn (Dollars
18.9bn), or 2.3 per cent of the FT-SE 100 index, exposure to Hanson provides
a good proxy for investment in the UK equity market as a whole.
The bonds also convert into Hanson American depositary receipts, which may
attract US institutions into buying the convertible bonds in the secondary
market.
The conversion premium of 15 per cent at launch was high by the standards of
recent Euroconvertible issues. Analysts suggested that this might have saved
Hanson's share price from the 'skid' - investors switching out of the
ordinary shares and into the bonds - which has followed other convertible
issues.
Indeed, speculation that the bond issue might presage further acquisition
activity by the company pushed Hanson's share price up initially. The price
later fell back and the shares closed down 5p on the day at 220p against a
weaker stock market.
Although the bonds finally mature in 2006, investors yesterday assessed the
issue on the assumption that the paper would be called after five years.
Analysts at UK houses commented that the bonds looked slightly expensive,
assuming that the five-year call option would be exercised.
However, many continental European investors were attracted by the 9 1/2 per
cent coupon and regarded the option of conversion into equity as a bonus.
Demand from continental Europe supported the issue and the bonds traded
above the issue price of par throughout the day.
Credit Suisse First Boston, which lead managed the transaction, opted to
structure the issue as a bought deal with a syndicate of four banks.
CSFB said that the small syndicate was necessary to maintain tight control
of the deal. The terms had been fixed before the launch, exposing the
underwriting banks to considerable risk.
The success of the deal may prompt other UK companies to consider issuing
convertible bonds in the international market. However, the size of issues
is limited by rules imposed by UK institutional investors, under which
existing shareholders must be offered claw-back if the share capital of the
issuer is enlarged by more than 5 per cent.
Roche Holdings, the Swiss pharmaceuticals giant, said yesterday that its US
subsidiary would launch a Dollars 1bn warrant bond issue in the
international bond market. Swiss Bank Corporation was said to be lead
manager but declined to comment on the issue's timing.

FT  17 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Goldman Sachs sets commodity
index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOLDMAN SACHS, one of Wall Street's leading investment banks, has developed
a commodity index that it hopes will lure more institutional investors into
the often topsy-turvy futures markets.
The index provides a needed performance benchmark for investors, according
to Mr Timothy O'Neill, a Goldman Sachs partner, and this should help
increase the attraction of commodities as an asset class.
The Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) will include futures on 18 physical
commodities and will measure total return, including both price change and
yield, with comparisons to returns from equities and bonds.
Energy and food products account for nearly 90 per cent of its value, with
industrial and precious metals making up the balance.
The GSCI is intended as an aid for investors to hedge their portfolio risks
against inflation and, because commodities are countercyclical to returns on
bonds and equities, provide some portfolio insurance against drops in other
markets.
Many institutional investors have hesitated to make commodity investments
because of the 'speculative, fighter-pilot image' of the industry, said Mr
O'Neill.
But these apprehensions can be put to rest by an index that measures the
performance of these markets just as other indices do for bonds and
equities, he said.
The GSCI will compete with an index by the Commodity Research Bureau, a
division of the Knight Ridder Financial Publishing Group, and an index by
Dow Jones.
Goldman Sachs may also develop products such as an investment fund based on
the GSCI.
Through its J. Aron Currency and Commodities Division, the bank is one of
the world's largest trading and advisory firms in the markets for petroleum
products and precious and industrial metals.

FT  17 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: D-Mark warrant launched by
Amex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE American Stock Exchange (Amex) yesterday launched a new D-Mark warrant
to meet demand from US investors for a financial instrument that reflected
the changed economic conditions of united Germany, writes Patrick Harverson.
The D-Mark currency warrant - which trades like a call option and fluctuates
in value as the US dollar rises or falls against the D-Mark - carries a
strike price of DM1.7 and expires on September 30 1992. Issued by Merrill
Lynch, it is the first D-Mark product launched by the exchange since the
reunification of Germany last year.
Amex said that investors had been seeking an instrument that took into
account the effect on the D-Mark of German unification. The warrants would
allow investors to participate in long-term investment or hedging
strategies, said Amex.
. .The price rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 3 1/4 on turnover of 6,100
warrants by midday.

FT  17 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Reduced competition lifts
BFCE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Francaise du Commerce Exterieur (BFCE), the French foreign trade
bank, recovered strongly last year due to slightly less intense competition
from other banks, writes George Graham in Paris.
Gross operating profit rose 38 per cent to FFr391m (Dollars 69m), on net
banking income 7 per cent higher at FFr1.79bn.
Average lending margins, which had fallen by a percentage point over the
previous four years, increased slightly to 64 basis points last year, and
the bank is experiencing a stronger improvement in the early months of this
year. Without a deposit base, BFCE has faced fierce competition in the
corporate market from high street banks.
However, all last year's income was used to boost BFCE's provisions for bad
debts, where the bank is still trying to improve its cover.
BFCE received FFr1.38bn last year from its shareholders to cover its
sovereign debt risks, as part of a capital restructuring. That resulted in
Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the state-owned insurer, becoming its
main shareholder with 43 per cent, alongside Credit Lyonnais, the
state-owned bank, with 24 per cent.
However, the bank devoted more than FFr200m extra to sovereign risk
provisions at the end of the year from its earnings, and FFr153m for
specific customer provisions and FFr30m to cover falls in the value of its
securities portfolio.
This brings BFCE's provisions to 51 per cent of its sovereign debt exposure,
less than most other major French banks but enough to enable it to take its
third world debt portfolio off its balance sheet.
The bank now plans to do this by the end of this year, using a combination
of an offshore trust backed by US Treasury bonds, and a system of options to
sell.
BFCE is currently turning its corporate finance division into a subsidiary,
and is looking for partners from Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK to take
stakes of about FFr80m to FFr100m each.
Then BFCE plans to seek a major foreign bank which might take a stake in the
parent company.

FT  17 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Bank hopes five-year stock
will set benchmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England announced that it would offer a Pounds 1.2bn tranche of
10 per cent conversion stock due 1996 for auction on April 24 which it hopes
will create a five-year benchmark.
The auction will increase the amount available of 10 per cent conversion
stock due 1996 to Pounds 3bn. A representative of the Bank said that it
would help to create a needed five-year benchmark against which investors
could compare foreign bonds such as five-year French government securities
and German five-year bunds.
The tranche will also provide liquidity for the interest-rate swaps market,
in which five-year maturities are considered the most important.
Swaps between floating rates and fixed rates require a steady flow of
fixed-interest payments. The fixed-rate payments are provided by gilts over
a range of maturities, although five-year gilts are the most commonly used.
However, the Bank has been buying gilts during the last three years and has
only recently announced a regular programme of issuing large amounts of
gilts to allow the government to meet its borrowing requirements. Hence the
amount of stock available for swaps has decreased.
The Bank said that applicants whose competitive bids were accepted would be
allotted stock at their bid price.
The issue is partly paid at issue, with 50 per cent payable on May 28.
Traders said that if the gilts market strengthened in the next few days,
investors might be attracted by the issue being partly paid as this provides
them with the opportunity to gear up.
The gilts market has been weak recently, however, and traders pointed out
that the flood of rights issues and sterling Eurobonds in recent days might
mean that the market has difficulty digesting the new tranche.
The auction will be the first that the Bank of England has held since August
1988, when it auctioned 8 1/2 per cent Treasury stock due 1994. During
1987-88, the Bank held what it called an 'experimental series' of four
auctions combined with gilts issues.
The dividend dates on the new tranche are May 15 and November 15. The gilt
matures on November 15 1996.

<TEXT>
SAPPI, South Africa's largest pulp and paper manufacturer, reported a 38 per
cent drop to R374.7m (Dollars 138m) in net earnings in the year ended
February, 1991.
This follows a 44 per cent decline in the first six months, at R182.6m down
from R326.8m.
That result was affected by a series of labour and production difficulties
and weaker prices for its products.
The latest results saw turnover drop 2 per cent to R2.67bn from R2.73bn.
Mr Eugene von As, managing director, said: 'World markets were against us,
with steadily declining selling prices in international markets, and a
depressed market at home.'
He added: 'And we had to contend with a full year of a stronger rand and
high interest rates.'
A feature of the year was the establishment of Sappi Europe following the
acquisition of five paper mills in the UK and the acquisition of the Hong
Kong based Speciality Pulp Trading (SPT).
The latter holds contracts to distribute all Sappi's non-rand denominated
sales.
Mr von As said the turnover contribution of Sappi's offshore associates was
about an additional R1bn.
Mr von As said Sappi Europe, the launching pad for the group's planned
growth into the European market, hoped to consolidate its position both
organically and by acquisition.
Looking ahead, he predicted a modest increase in earnings in the current 12
months.
He said world markets in paper and pulp remained soft with dollar prices for
the main grades currently 19 per cent below levels a year ago.
Earnings per share for last year fell to 402 cents from 650 cents.
Sappi is maintaining its dividend at 200 cents a share.

<TEXT>
MALAYSIAN Mining Corpor-ation (MMC), Malaysia's largest tin mining group,
has suffered its worst year since the 1985 collapse of the tin market and
plans to cut its dividend.
Group operating profits collapsed to MDollars 4.6m (USDollars 1.67m) from
MDollars 53m, following a loss on tin mining operations. Bolstered by
improved dividend income, pre-tax profits emerged at MDollars 81m compared
with MDollars 120m a year earlier.
Group turnover fell to MDollars 1.1bn from MDollars 1.6bn, despite
improvements at its associates where turnover rose marginally to MDollars
408m from MDollars 382m.
Attributable profit was 39 per cent lower at MDollars 83m. The group is
cutting its dividend to MDollars 14m from MDollars 19m, with a second-half
proposed dividend of 10 cents a share.
Perlis Plantations, the big sugar and flour group, yesterday reported higher
profits and turnover. Operating profit for 1990 rose by 32 per cent to
MDollars 168m (USDollars 61m) on a 28 per cent rise in turnover to MDollars
2.6bn.
Helped by higher dividend income, pre-tax profit increased to MDollars 204m
from MDollars 157m. The dividend is being held at 16 per cent.

<TEXT>
BOISE Cascade, the US forest products group, suffered a loss in the first
three months of this year and has warned that its performance in the current
quarter may be even worse, writes Bernard Simon.
Weak markets, exacerbated by higher costs and interest rates, pushed the
company into a Dollars 16.9m, or 53-cents-a-share, loss compared with a
Dollars 33.6m, or 73-cents, profit a year earlier. Sales slipped to Dollars
992.7m from Dollars 1.1bn.
As part of its response to the recession, Boise is cutting its capital
spending budget to about Dollars 300m this year, only slightly more than one
third the 1990 level. The Dollars 2bn it spent on capital investment in the
past three years is the chief cause of higher first-quarter interest and
depreciation charges.
The company said prices have been eroded for most grades of paper it
produces, and its wood products. Uncoated white papers, its largest single
grade, have been especially hard hit.

improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL ELECTRIC's diverse mix of businesses enabled it to overcome much of
the impact of the recession in the first quarter. The Connecticut-based
conglomerate posted a 5 per cent advance in net earnings and showed improved
margins.
GE, whose interests range from power turbines to broadcasting, posted net
income of Dollars 999m, or Dollars 1.15 a share, up from Dollars 950m, or
Dollars 1.06 a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 6 per cent to Dollars
13.3bn.
Operating margins widened to 12.1 per cent from 11.8 per cent, the highest
ever for a first quarter. The company said its productivity improved at an
annualised rate of more than 5 per cent.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said that while the company might continue to be
cushioned by its diversity, it saw no evidence that the surge in consumer
confidence following the end of the Gulf war was being followed by any
'meaningful' pick-up in business activity.
The strongest growth in earnings came from what GE calls its 'long-cycle'
capital goods businesses, chiefly aircraft engines, power station equipment
and medical systems.
Earnings at GE Financial Services, which includes GE Capital and the
brokerage firm Kidder Peabody, advanced by 15 per cent.
GE said that only NBC, its wholly-owned television network, suffered a
significant drop in income in the quarter.

FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Merrill Lynch soars 338% as Wall
St fortunes recover
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE EXTENT of the turnround in Wall Street's fortunes since the beginning of
the year was fully revealed yesterday when Merrill Lynch, the biggest
securities house in the US, reported a 338 per cent increase in
first-quarter profits, to Dollars 181m.
The Dollars 1.62-a-share earned by Merrill Lynch in the quarter exceeded the
Dollars 1.59-a-share reported by the company for the whole of 1990. In the
first quarter of 1990, it made a profit of just Dollars 41.3m, or 34 cents a
share.
The stock market had been expecting good news from the company and, by
mid-session, Merrill Lynch shares had risen only Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 39
5/8 .
An 18 per cent increase in revenues to a record Dollars 3.1bn was behind the
dramatic improvement in earnings, with income from principal trading
business rising 57 per cent to Dollars 550m, another all-time high.
The company said trading revenues from swaps, government and agency
securities, high-yield corporate bonds, corporate equities, and money market
products rose significantly.
Commission revenues also rose sharply, climbing 21 per cent to Dollars 521m,
a reflection of improved market conditions, increased demand for securities
from investors, and higher transaction fees charged to customers.
Merrill Lynch even turned in a profit on investment banking, the business
that has endured the biggest contraction in the past 12 months. Revenues
from investment banking rose 7 per cent to Dollars 195m, with an increase in
the underwriting of corporate debt and mortgage and asset-backed securities
compensating for a decline in merger and acquisition activity.
Asset management and custodial fee income advanced 12 per cent to Dollars
191m for the quarter, with assets under fee-based management increasing by a
record Dollars 11bn to Dollars 121bn.
The results of the restructuring of Merrill Lynch that began in 1989 showed
through in lower costs for the quarter. Operating expenses, excluding
insurance, compensation and benefits, fell 5 per cent to the lowest level
for over three years, aided by a 15 per cent reduction in expenditure on
advertising and market development.
The number of staff fell by about 800 in the quarter, taking the total jobs
shed since the end of 1987 to over 8,000.
Total expenses actually rose, to Dollars 2.9bn, primarily because of the
rise in commissions paid to financial consultants and account executives and
in bonuses paid to other employees.
Bear Stearns, the Wall Street securities house, yesterday unveiled fiscal
third-quarter profits of Dollars 57.7m, up 82 per cent on the Dollars 34.6m
earned a year earlier. Gross revenues were Dollars 626.9m, against Dollars
587.6m.

<TEXT>
ELI LILLY, the large US pharmaceuticals company, unveiled a 14 per cent
advance in first-quarter after-tax profits, in line with the general
strength of the drugs sector.
The group made Dollars 495.8m in the three months to the end of March,
compared with Dollars 430.1m in the same period a year ago.
The profit figures were scored on sales of Dollars 1.44bn, up 16 per cent on
the previous year's figure. Eli said the improvement derived largely from
volume increases in its domestic and international markets.
Among the main product contributors were Axid, which treats ulcers; Ceclor,
an antibiotic and Eli Lilly's top seller; Humulin, a genetically-engineered
insulin; Humantrope, a growth hormone also genetically-engineered by Eli
Lilly; and Prozac, the anti-depressant, which has run into controversy,
provoking lawsuits which claim the drug has harmful side-effects.
Eli Lilly acknowledged that cost increases outstripped sales growth in the
quarter, saying the rise in marketing and administrative expenses from
Dollars 303.6m to Dollars 365.7m reflected added promotional costs on newer
products.

sales
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG SALES of its most recent drugs helped Merck, the US pharmaceuticals
company, to post a 20 per cent improvement in first-quarter earnings, on
sales that rose 17 per cent.
The company had net income of Dollars 483.5m, or Dollars 1.25 a share, in
the three months ended March 31, compared with Dollars 403.8m, or Dollars
1.03, a year earlier. Sales were Dollars 2.05bn, against Dollars 1.76bn.
Mr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive, attributed the improved
earnings to strong unit volume gains, better product mix, cost controls,
productivity improvements and a lower tax rate.
Sales and earnings were also helped by a favourable exchange rate, which
lifted sales in the quarter by 3 percentage points. Sales outside the US
accounted for 45 per cent of the first-quarter total, the same proportion as
the previous year.
On Wall Street, Merck's results underlined the relative safety of the drug
sector, and its shares added Dollars 1 to Dollars 110 3/4 at mid-session
yesterday, just shy of their 52-week high of Dollars 110 7/8 .
During the 1980s, Merck paced the industry in introducing new drugs, and its
first-quarter results reflected the strong sales of a range including
Mevacor, Vasotec, Zocor, Prinivil and Vaseretic.
Merck said yesterday it had filed a new drug application with the Food &amp;
Drug Administration (FDA) for its Proscar drug to treat benign prostate
enlargement. The condition afflicts about 60 per cent of all men over 50.
The drug could bring in annual sales of Dollars 1bn by the end of the
decade.
American Home Products, another big US drugs company, also reported improved
first-quarter earnings and underlying sales yesterday.
The company, which sold its household products and depilatory businesses
last June, had net income of Dollars 352.5m, or Dollars 1.12, compared with
Dollars 314.5m, or Dollars 1 a share, a year ago.
Net sales slid 3 per cent to Dollars 1.76bn from Dollars 1.81bn. However,
after stripping out discontinued businesses, sales rose by Dollars 133.2m,
or 8 per cent, in the 1991 quarter.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INSURANCE regulators in New York State yesterday took control of Executive
Life of New York, the smaller of the two main operating units of First
Executive, the troubled Los Angeles-based life insurer.
The action by the New York Insurance Department followed a similar seizure
by the Californian regulators of Executive Life, First Executive's larger
operating unit last week.
First Executive is the biggest insurance company debacle the US has ever
encountered.
Overall, the California-based company was reckoned to have almost Dollars
50bn worth of insurance in force at the end of 1990, and hundreds of
thousands of policyholders.
The smaller New York unit alone has some 103,000 policyholders and
certificate-holders, and reported earned premiums of Dollars 94m last year.
Publicity about First Executive's enormous 'junk bond' portfolio - it is
believed to be the largest holder of junk after the Resolution Trust
Corporation - in the wake of the Drexel Burnham Lambert bankruptcy a year
ago, lead to a wave of policy surrenders at the company. The insurer's
problems were compounded when its sales network disintegrated.
Action by the New York regulators against the Executive Life New York unit
was widely expected.
The insurance department said last week it was completing a study of the
unit's financial condition, and expected to make a decision on the
operation's immediate future earlier this week.
Earlier this month, as worries about First Executive's financial condition
mounted, the New York department told Executive Life to stop writing new
business and to bolster its reserves by Dollars 125m.
Yesterday's move against the unit involved the insurance department
petitioning the New York State Supreme Court for the authority to take
possession of the insurer and directly oversee its operations.
While the court considers a permanent order, it issued a temporary
restraining order, placing the company under the authority and control of Mr
Salvatore Curiale, the New York superintendent of insurance.
The New York regulators immediately suspended all policy surrenders and
policy loans at Executive Life New York. They stressed that the unit was not
insolvent, but said they were worried that speculation about the company's
future might lead to a 'severe cash-flow strain and dissipation of the
company's assets'. Surrenders have risen from 25 a day a few weeks ago, to
over 400 a day.
The regulators' aim is to 'rehabilitate' the unit. Mr Curiale said yesterday
a group of New York companies, headed by Metropolitan Life, the second
largest US insurer, had stepped forward to help manage the company and
advise the department.
However, none of these companies have offered to buy Executive Life New York
outright.

<TEXT>
BP IS seeking a buyer for Tex/Con Oil and Gas, a wholly-owned Texas-based
subsidiary which holds all the British company's onshore natural gas
interests in the US, excluding Alaska.
BP Exploration declined to comment on its plans for Tex/Con. However, energy
industry sources said the sale would be in keeping with BP's shift of
emphasis in its exploration activities from the lower 48 US states to
'frontier' areas, such as Alaska and Central and South America.
An analyst in London said Tex/Con is likely to fetch between Dollars 650m
and Dollars 1bn. According to US reports, BP has appointed investment bank
JP Morgan to handle the sale. Prospective buyers will soon be invited to
inspect details of Tex/Con's financial and operating condition in New York
and Houston.
Tex/Con's business, which includes exploration, production and pipelines, is
centred in Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. It has interests in 3,000 wells
and operates 1,500 miles of gas-gathering pipelines. Tex/Con produces about
11,800 barrels of oil and 121m cu ft of gas a day.
BP does not disclose revenue or profit figures for Tex/Con. But low natural
gas prices, an inability to fully replace reserves, and falling oil
production appear to have contributed to BP's disillusion with Tex/Con,
which was set up as an autonomous, entrepreneurial venture. Staff has been
sharply cut back as part of an effort to reduce overheads.
The company's problems emerged last week when BP announced Tex/Con's chief
executive Mr Bill Johnson was taking early retirement. Mr Johnson has been
replaced by Mr Bill Sears, formerly vice-president for offshore exploration.

<TEXT>
SQUARE D, the Illinois electrical products maker, is counting on several
important obstacles to thwart Schneider's bid to gain control of the
company. Schneider of France announced this week it had been tendered 78.1
per cent of Square D's shares and extended its hostile tender offer of
Dollars 78 per share, or Dollars 1.9bn, until May 3.
Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, Schneider chairman, said Square D was
neglecting its shareholders' will by refusing to remove barriers to the
transaction.
First, Square D's board would have to waive the company's obligation under
the strict hostile takeover law of Delaware, where it is incorporated. Under
that law, a hostile bidder for a company must acquire at least 85 per cent
of the shares.
The board would also have to lift a poison pill provision that makes a
takeover prohibitively expensive. However, it refuses to remove these
conditions, effectively preventing Schneider from purchasing the tendered
shares.
Schneider has launched a proxy fight to change the board at the company's
annual meeting on May 24. The large amount of tendered shares would appear
to enhance Schneider's proxy efforts, but the path is hardly clear even if
it succeeds in obtaining the required simple majority of proxy votes.
Schneider's first slate of nominees for the Square D board is the subject of
a lawsuit in which Square D alleges the candidates would violate the
interlocking directorates provision of US anti-trust statutes. A hearing in
the US District Court of New York is due on May 13.

GROUPE BULL, the loss-making French computer maker, yesterday increased
management control of its US-based overseas division, so paving the way for
a full reorganisation of the group's cumbersome structure.
It paid an undisclosed sum to buy the remaining 12.8 per cent stake held by
Honeywell, the US electronics group, in Bull HN Information Systems, which
groups the bulk of the French company's activities in North America, the
Pacific Rim and Australia.
This means Groupe Bull will own 85 per cent of Bull HN, with the remaining
15 per cent in the hands of NEC, the Japanese electronics company which is
being discreetly courted as a possible minority partner in the group itself.
Mr Francis Lorentz, Bull's chairman, is working on plans, due to be
completed in the summer, to merge Bull's four fragmented operating units
into a single company. This implies bringing NEC into the group ownership,
though officials of neither company are prepared to go into more detail.
Bull recently announced a record FFr6.8bn (Dollars 1.20bn) loss for 1990,
following which the French government has had to pledge FFr4bn of fresh
capital over the next two years to fund job losses and the costs of
rationalising the organisation.
NEC has been a partner in Bull HN since the unit was formed in 1987 by Bull,
Honeywell and the Japanese company, from Honeywell's information systems
division. Honeywell has gradually run down its 42.5 per cent stake in the
joint company over the years, to leave its hands free to concentrate on its
core controls business.
Bull has at the same time been expanding in North America, culminating with
last year's Dollars 511.5m takeover of Zenith Data Systems, the
microcomputer maker. Apart from Zenith and Bull HN, the other two divisions
embrace Bull's French and European operations.

FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: First-quarter downturn at
Mannesmann

<TEXT>
MANNESMANN, the German engineering group, has reported a 9 per cent drop in
sales in the first quarter of 1991 reflecting the effects of slower growth
in several leading economies on the big German exporters.
The German Association of Machine and Plant Builders recently complained of
a drop in the value of exports of more than 10 per cent in the first two
months of 1991.
However the current strength of the dollar may help to offset this export
weakness.
Mannesmann also reported a 12 per cent drop in orders in the first quarter.
However, Mr Werner Dieter, chairman, said that last year's sales of DM23.9bn
(Dollars 14bn) and pre-tax earnings of DM505m, as well as the dividend,
could be maintained.
The first-quarter results were marked by a very sharp deterioration in
Mannesmann's Brazilian subsidiary, suffering the effects of the recent
economic austerity packages.
Stripping out Brazil, the sales drop would have been only 4 per cent and the
orders drop 6 per cent.
Mr Dieter said that he regretted having raised the possibility of a big
takeover in the US two years ago.
But he said the search for a suitable acquisition was continuing and several
big deals had been thoroughly researched before being rejected.
Mannesmann is still in the process of raising its stake in Britain's TI
Group from 5 per cent to 9 per cent.
Meanwhile, the price of leased lines for Mannesmann's digital mobile phone
operation, a crucial determinant of its longer-term profitability, remains
unresolved.
The company's D2 network, which is due to begin competing with the
Bundespost-Telekom's state-owned D1 network later this year, is in the
difficult position of having to hire lines from its competitor.
Telekom originally offered Mannesmann its standard price - which Mannesmann
claims is about four times the OECD average - but this was rejected by the
Bundespost, which despite being Telekom's owner has to adjudicate on such
pricing matters.
Mr Peter Mihatsch, head of Mannesmann Mobilfunk, said that Telekom's
subsequent offer - an overall reduction of more than 50 per cent - was still
not satisfactory and was still 'double the international level'.
A final decision from the Bundespost is expected in June.
One of east Germany's best known capital goods manufacturers, Sket of
Magdeburg, hopes to come to the stock market after three successful trading
years.
In the current year it expects sales of about DM1bn (Dollars 598m) and
losses of DM60m, but in the course of the year it will be cutting its
workforce from 15,000 to 7,000.

FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: L'Oreal meets forecast with
FFr1.69bn

<TEXT>
L'OREAL, the leading French cosmetics group, has met its forecasts with a 15
per cent increase in net current profits to FFr1.69bn (Dollars 298.8m) last
year, its fifth consecutive year of double digit earnings growth.
The company, whose products range from Elnett hairspray to Helena Rubinstein
cosmetics, Lancome skin creams and Ralph Lauren perfumes, said sales rose to
FFr30.4bn, up 12.5 per cent on a comparable basis.
Net attributable profits totalled FFr1.82bn, compared with FFr1.80bn in
1989. Last year's results included essentially only one exceptional gain, a
FFr272m clawback from the FFr388m provision made the previous year to cover
a dispute with the French tax authorities over the treatment of l'Oreal's
royalty revenues, whereas 1989 had included FFr747m of exceptional profits
mainly from the sale of its hygiene and comfort divisions.
L'Oreal's hair and skin care products performed particularly strongly in
1990. Although the perfumes division showed a slowdown towards the end of
the year and worsened at the start of this year, some perfumes, such as the
Ralph Lauren and Paloma Picasso brands, produced strong gains.
Mr Pascal Castres Saint Martin, vice-president in charge of administration
and finance, said L'Oreal's improved results stemmed principally from its
control of the cost of raw materials and outside services.
'All our outside services were very tightly managed, including advertising
costs, which had risen faster than sales in 1989. Last year, advertising
progressed at around the same rate as sales,' he said.
L'Oreal was less affected by currency movements than many of its competitors
in the perfume and beauty products sector. Around 44 per cent of its sales
are billed in French francs, and a further 40 per cent in other currencies
belonging to the European Monetary System, Mr Castres Saint Martin
explained.
The group's exposure to the dollar is limited because its US activities are
conducted, for historical reasons connected with the old French exchange
control regulations, through an associate, Cosmair, which it manages but
does not own, and from which it receives royalties.

eliminate debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale de Belgique plans to wipe out virtually all its short-term
debt through divestitures and a fresh capital injection, the company said
yesterday while announcing a 39.4 per cent fall in net group profit for
1990. The dividend is unchanged on 1989 at a net BFr84 a share.
La Generale, Belgium's largest holding company, said it hoped to raise
BFr36bn (Dollars 1.05bn) by the year-end, and reduce the BFr30.3bn net
short-term debt of the parent company and wholly-owned financial
subsidiaries by at least BFr25bn.
It plans to raise BFr25bn by selling off parts of its portfolio, and BFr11bn
from its two main shareholders, Compagnie de Suez, the French financial
conglomerate which owns 61 per cent, and its insurance company AG, which
holds 14 per cent as head of the Generale consortium.
Mr Etienne Davignon, La Generale chairman, emphasised however that 'the
jewels of La Generale are not going to be sold . . . this will not be a
lottery'. He specifically ruled out CBR, its cement business, Tractebel, its
electricity supplier, Generale de Banque, the banking arm, and AG.
The planned divestiture comes after net group profits fell to BFr12.2bn last
year, against BFr20.1 in 1989, and 'an even worse' first quarter this year.
Worst hit was the group's non-ferrous metals business, where earnings fell
to BFr2.5bn from BFr9.6bn in 1989.
Higher financial costs from the parent company's increased debt ratios, and
the cost of disposing of most of FN, the stricken Belgian arms maker, were
other main reasons for what a group spokesman called 'a lousy year'.
Mr Gerard Mestrallet, sent in by Suez to take over from Mr Herve de Carmoy
as managing director earlier this year, said FN losses plus the cost of
redundancies had cost La Generale BFr5.6bn.
The holding company made significant disposals last year which bolstered its
profits, including stakes in two Belgian insurance companies, a French
construction group, and in Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecommunications
company. It reported extraordinary profits of BFr5.9bn.

ROCHE, the Swiss pharma-ceuticals and chemicals group, yesterday disclosed
net consolidated earnings of SFr948m (Dollars 668m) for 1990, up 11.3 per
cent on the previous year.
The board proposes to increase the dividend by SFr4 to SFr42 per share and
genussschein (non-voting stock).
At the same time Roche announced that its US subsidiary, Roche Holdings, was
planning a Eurobond issue with warrants of the order of Dollars 1bn. Swiss
Bank Corporation, the lead manager, is expected to announce details this
week.
Roche bought 60 per cent of Genentech, the Californian biotechnology
company, last year in a Dollars 2.1bn deal, which it financed through a
multi-layer short-term credit. The bond issue will switch part on to a
longer-term basis.
Group sales, disclosed earlier, climbed by 3 per cent to SFr9.67bn in 1990,
an increase equivalent to 14 per cent in local currency terms, Roche said.
The turnover figure includes fourth-quarter sales by Genentech but excludes
sales by the Maag crop protection business and the Medi-Physics
radiopharmaceuticals company which Roche disposed of during 1990.
All divisions, particularly pharmaceuticals, had contributed to the positive
results, as had non-operational income, Roche said.
Last year's 11 per cent improvement in group earnings had been achieved
despite the adverse effects of the appreciation of the Swiss franc against
other leading currencies, Roche said.
The strength of the franc also strongly influenced the results of the two
other big Basle-based Swiss chemicals groups. Ciba-Geigy is dropping its
dividend to SFr60 from SFr65 after posting a 33 per cent fall in net
consolidated earnings to SFr1bn, while Sandoz is maintaining an unchanged
dividend after reporting a 1 per cent increase in group net profit to
SFr967m.

in demand
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMSON CSF, Europe's largest defence electronics group, yesterday provided
the latest evidence of the slowdown in military equipment demand, with a
17.4 per cent decline in net profits for 1990.
Net profits fell to FFr2.17bn (Dollars 383m) last year, from FFr2.63bn in
1989, the second consecutive year of earnings decline, but fractionally
better than the group had earlier forecast. Turnover rose 9.8 per cent,
slightly more than expected, to FFr37.02bn from FFr33.69bn over the same
period.
Thomson CSF, 60 per cent owned by the French government, attributed the
profits decline to an increase in restructuring charges, to FFr1.1bn from
FFr716m in 1989, plus a reduction in contributions from minority holdings,
to FFr717m, down from FFr1.27bn, over the same period. Thomson-CSF is making
heavy reductions in its workforce to slim capacity in line with demand.
However, last year's net profits margin came out at 6 per cent as forecast,
which Mr Alain Gomez, group chairman, said is among the best in the defence
electronics industry.
Thomson CSF is one of the two main divisions of the fully state owned
Thomson group, along with Thomson Consumer Electronics, which in February
announced a FFr2.7bn net loss, after a FFr1.8bn restructuring charge.

<TEXT>
OPERATIONS OF Merlin International Properties, which faces possible
receivership, are to be investigated by the Isle of Man fraud squad.
'I have no reason at this moment to believe there has been criminal
activity,' Mr William Cain, the Manx Attorney General, said yesterday. The
investigation was ordered after some shareholders complained about heavy
losses by the company and circumstances surrounding a recent takeover bid
for it.
A Pounds 2.9m agreed offer of 5p per share from Luirc, a British Virgin
Islands company, was announced at the end of February. The bid failed to get
Stock Exchange approval because its funding was conditional, and was
withdrawn two weeks ago.
Luirc is still keen to mount a further bid if it can get dispensation from
the takeover panel. A further bid from the same source would not normally be
allowed within 12 months of collapse of the first one.
Some of Merlin's Manx-based private shareholders say the identity of the
bidder has not been made clear, and suspect some past or present directors
may be acting in concert with the bidder. Luirc has stated that there was no
connection between it and Merlin directors.

FT  17 APR 91 / UK Company News: An undiminished appetite for growth -
Charles Leadbeater on Morgan Crucible's cash-raising habit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RIGHTS ISSUES seem to have become habit-forming at Morgan Crucible, the
industrial materials group.
In each of the past five years it has had some form of paper money-raising
drive to pick up about Pounds 200m for a string of acquisitions which has
fuelled its growth.
With hardly a pause to burp before digesting acquisitions it made last year,
Morgan has moved onto the next course. On Monday it announced a Pounds 96m
rights issue to fund a set of deals, which are being thrown up as the
recession forces a shake-out among competitors in the US and continental
Europe.
Morgan's undiminished appetite for acquisitions and its lack of inhibition
in seeking more capital from its shareholders raises a central question
about the group's strategy and future.
What sort of company is Morgan Crucible becoming? There are two sides to its
character. It could be a free wheeling, mini-conglomerate driven by an
ambition for bids and deals it cannot fund from its own cashflow.
Alternatively, it could be a solid materials technology company which is
attempting to become a world force in its chosen areas by buying up small
and medium sized companies in traditionally fragmented industries.
Just as there are these two sides to Morgan's character so there are two
quite different accounts of its performance.
The sceptics argue that Morgan treads too close to the edge.
It has ruled out financing acquisitions by borrowing. Net debt rose from
Pounds 110m to Pounds 118m last year. Gearing is 60 per cent. It cannot
generate enough cash from its own operations to fund acquisitions. So after
much soul searching it is making another cash call upon shareholders.
Yet its record for spotting the right acquisitions is mixed. Dr Bruce
Farmer, Morgan's chief executive, disclosed that at least two of the deals
of the mid-1980s which were meant to have a strategic significance may be
unravelled.
The car care division of Holt Lloyd, acquired in 1986, may well be sold in
1992 or 1993. Morgan is also planning to leave defence electronics which was
meant to be built around its purchase of First Castle Electronics. That deal
led to a lengthy legal wrangle over the price and First Castle's profit
forecasts at the time of the bid, which was settled only this year. These
deals seemed to have been the openings to a four-year journey down blind
alleys.
The string of deals makes it difficult to pin down Morgan's underlying
performance. Although pre-tax profits for the past year were up 10 per cent,
in the second half there was a marked downturn in several areas. This was
partially offset by the turnover and operating profit bought in by
acquisitions and some accounting for currencies and interest which raised
eyebrows among some analysts.
The believers tell a very different tale. Morgan has been transformed by
hard management graft. At the depth of recession in the early 1980s Morgan
made a loss. Its pre-tax profit in the final months of 1990 was up on 1989.
Since 1982 it has sold 19 businesses and closed 21 sites. The late 1970s had
delivered five very flat years for Morgan. The new management installed
under Dr Farmer injected growth.
Holt Lloyd formed the basis for a thriving speciality chemicals business in
the US. Morgan is not alone in seeking to get out of defence electronics and
most British car retail and components groups have seen their profits fall
in the last year.
Morgan has a good record with acquisitions in its specialist fields where it
has strong niche positions. One of the deals it is currently considering
could make it Europe's leading producer of technical ceramics. A Pounds 24m
deal in January brought it Dulmison, an Australian ceramics producer with
annual sales of Pounds 58m, profits of Pounds 8m and factories in the US and
Thailand.
Although it cut investment by 40 per cent last year, since 1982 it has
invested more than double its depreciation charge each year. It can generate
organic growth: talks with Italian tap makers has created a Pounds 40m a
year business in ceramic discs for bathroom equipment.
The company has a wide spread of customer industries stretching from
automotive and chemicals, to metal bashers and rail equipment makers. Its
internationalisation has also been impressive. In 1979 about 44 per cent of
sales were in the UK, compared with 18 per cent last year.
Its internationalisation is continuing. It has three joint ventures in
China, one in production the other two signed up. It is expanding in Korea,
Taiwan and Singapore, as well as exploring deals in Hungary, Czechoslovakia
and Poland.
For those hoping that Morgan will resolve tensions between the two aspects
of its character, Dr Farmer offers little hope.
Asked whether the company should model itself on BTR or become a specialist
producer of ceramics and carbon, he replies: 'We should be somewhere between
the two.'

FT  17 APR 91 / UK Company News: Banks seek changes to rules covering BT
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is to consider a request from some of the biggest high street
banks to amend the regulatory rules covering share dealings in the sale of
part of its stake in British Telecom.
The radical proposal to cut the 'regulatory red tape' is in response to the
government's call for innovative ideas as to how to distribute the stake
The banks want retail institutions offering shares in the sale to the public
to be exempt from some of the tougher clauses contained in the Financial
Services Act.
In the first of a series of meetings with Treasury officials and SG Warburg,
the government's lead adviser in the sale, the banks will today argue that
the red tape is putting off shops and building societies from selling the
shares.
The Treasury has called for ideas from financial institutions to be sent or
given to it by May 19.
Under the present regulatory rules any company selling shares has to be
regulated by either the Securities and Investment Board (SIB) or one of the
other self-regulatory organisations.
The banks want the government to offer a list of retail houses which want to
sell BT shares a simpler regulatory framework or cheaper associated
membership of one of the SROs.
They want the Government to distinguish between the big stockbrokers and
smaller retail institutions which might be persuaded to sell the BT shares.
Some of the banks believe that high street shops, such as Marks and Spencer
and J Sainsbury, could be persuaded to sell the shares if the regulatory
framework was simplified.
Mr Tony Vine-Lott, managing director of Barclays Stockbrokers, the bank's
retail share dealing service, said: 'The Government should provide a new
simpler regulatory framework with SIB or another SRO from an approved list
of organisations willing to sell the BT shares.'
Mr Steve Crockford, director of Midland Bank's stockbroking service, said:
'The Government must recognise that there should be a difference in the
regulatory rules between small retail organisations which want to sell BT
shares and the all-bells-all-whistling stockbroking service offered by the
big institutions.'
Most of the banks are members of the Securities and Futures Authority,
formerly The Securities Association. The first 10 employees selling shares
have to be registered for an individual annual fee of Pounds 500, the next
90 at Pounds 260.
If the building societies chose to be regulated by SIB the cost is between
Pounds 2,500 and Pounds 100,000, depending on the number of investment
staff.
The Cheltenham and Gloucester building society pulled out of SIB in
September 1989 after its fees went up tenfold to more than Pounds 100,000.
Although SIB has since reformed its compliance costs many of the banks
believe its fees are still prohibitive. A spokesman for the Cheltemham and
Gloucester said it would reconsider joining an SRO if the costs were
reduced.
In another proposal to sell the BT shares to as many investors as possible,
National Westminster will call for tax advantages to buy and hold shares and
greater education in the merits of share ownership.
Mr Neil Stapley, managing director of National Westminster Stockbrokers,
called for a more 'equitable relationship' between investors buying and
selling shares.
Other proposals include enabling potential BT shareholders to register for
shares before the share price is announced on the basis that they will be
guaranteed a certain amount of shares.
Some of the banks also believe they could offer more 'user friendly' share
services if the investor could have his account debited directly on buying
the shares in his branch, thereby relieving him of the trouble of writing
out a cheque.
Dewe Rogerson, the financial advertising and public relations group, has
been chosen by BT and the Treasury to market the sale of part of the
Government's BT stake.

dividend is raised to 12p.
Profits at El Oro, which in turn holds some 45 per cent of Exploration,
dipped from Pounds 2.71m to Pounds 2.5m pre-tax, from income of Pounds 2.7m
(Pounds 2.88m). Earnings fell to 37.69p (41.39p) but the recommended
distribution is lifted to 24p.

<TEXT>
Shares of Explaura Holdings yesterday declined 3p to 15 1/2 p after the
USM-quoted group, which has limestone quarrying interests in Canada,
reported a net deficit of Pounds 1m for 1990.
Mr David Finch, chairman, blamed the setback on start-up problems of new
quarry and plant facilities which limited production capability.
An exceptional charge of Pounds 297,000 related to production costs above
original estimates.
Nevertheless, production at Lower Cove, Newfoundland continued into early
winter with an inventory at the year-end of some 300,000 tonnes of graded
aggregate at the quarry.
The 'high costs' of establishing deep water marine terminals at
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Savannah, Georgia, were absorbed into
overheads.
Sales of aggregate for the year amounted to Pounds 266,000. Losses per share
deepened to 0.87p (0.06p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A year of high interest rates, recession and uncertainty in global
markets, Silvermines Group, the Dublin-based engineering and technology
company, reported profits almost halved from IPounds 7m to IPounds 3.81m
(Pounds 3.41m).
The 1989 result included profits of IPounds 4.56m from the sale of the
group's interests in Tuskar Resources.
Group turnover was static at IPounds 62.04m (IPounds 62.1m), and the
interest charge was higher at IPounds 3.77m against IPounds 3.48m.
Mr John O'Neill, chairman, said that decisive action had been taken which
had resulted in the sale - for Dollars 36m - of National Broach since the
year-end.
At the same time a review of the group's other activities had been
undertaken to facilitate a restructuring of its core activities, full
provision for which had been made in the the 1990 accounts, he said.
Before extraordinary items of IPounds 4.4m earnings per share came out at
7.9p (19.51p). A final dividend of 2.5p makes an unchanged total of 4p.

<TEXT>
ALBERT MARTIN, the clothing manufacturer and importer, raised pre-tax
profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 2.04m over 1990. Turnover was ahead from
Pounds 69.11m to Pounds 78.11m.
The recovery in UK operating profits, up 35 per cent to Pounds 1.98m, was
helped by increased business with Marks and Spencer. New and established
businesses helped overseas profits to Pounds 1.69m (Pounds 1.36m).
While noting that the current trading climate remains 'extremely difficult',
Mr Michael Kidd, chairman, was optimistic about prospects. Earlier this year
the board was reorganised, as a move to increase efficiency of the group's
manufacturing facilities, while developing its ability to source other
merchandise worldwide.
With capital expenditure of Pounds 2.4m, increased borrowings and high
interest rates pushed net finance charges to Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 1.22m),
although net borrowings at the year-end were little changed, amounting to 39
per cent of shareholders' funds.
After an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.8m, representing a UK plant
closure to improve manufacturing efficiency, and minorities of Pounds 82,000
(Pounds 101,000), earnings per share rose 36 per cent to 9p (6.6p). An
increased final dividend of 2.6p brings the total to 4.2p (4p). The shares
closed at 70p, up 12p.

FT  17 APR 91 / UK Company News: B&amp;C to float Exco unless buyer can be found
'in a few weeks'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AND Commonwealth will opt for a public flotation of Exco, its money
broking arm, unless a buyer emerges 'in a few weeks', according to the
administrators of the failed financial services group.
It would be the first flotation of a company out of administration since
Rolls Royce was floated from insolvency in 1971.
'Exco is an unusual animal that does not sit easily with one parent but
would sit well in the Stock Exchange,' said Mr Stephen Adamson, an Ernst and
Young partner and B&amp;C's senior administrator.
Exco is making pre-tax profits of Pounds 28m on an annual basis and is
considered one of B&amp;C's most valuable assets.
A sale or flotation could add about Pounds 200m to the Pounds 415m raised so
far from the sale of assets since B&amp;C was put into administration last June
in one of Britain's largest corporate failures.
Mr Adamson also said the administrators hoped to make their first repayments
to creditors late this year after agreeing a 'scheme of arrangement' that
would govern how B&amp;C's assets were to be distributed.
There were substantial advantages to proceeding with such a scheme as
opposed to a liquidation of assets, he said.
B&amp;C owed about Pounds 1bn to unsecured creditors in June and a further
Pounds 320m of convertible unsecured loan stock which is subordinated to
other creditors in a wind up.
The repayment scheme would establish a formula to repay creditors when B&amp;C
assets were sold and would operate over several years. Mr Adamson said the
administrators could not say how much the initial repayments would amount to
at this stage.
Holders of preference and ordinary shares were unlikely to see any return,
the administrators said in a letter to shareholders and creditors.
Included in the Pounds 415m raised is Pounds 100m on deposit at the Bank of
England which was part of the proceeds of the sale of Gartmore Investment to
Banque Indosuez.
The administrators were seeking legal advice as to whether creditors of B&amp;C
Holdings or B&amp;C Finance had first call in this deposit.
Mr Peter Phillips, a joint administrator, said he was expecting a ruling on
liability next week in B&amp;C's litigation against Quadrex Holdings and Samuel
Montagu.
The Pounds 200m claim follows Quadrex's failure to complete an agreed Pounds
280m purchase of the wholesale broking division of Mercantile House by
February 1988.
He denied B&amp;C had held talks about an out-of-court settlement with Midland
Bank, which is Samuel Montagu's parent, or the merchant bank which advised
Quadrex.
Following the collapse in March of efforts to sell British and Commonwealth
Merchant Bank to Bank of Cukurova, part of the Turkish industrial group, the
administrators are still seeking a buyer.
However Mr Adamson said he realised the climate for selling banks was
difficult and that the administrators were considering a 'voluntary
arrangement' with creditors under the insolvency act.
Creditors, who are owed a total of Pounds 300m, would be able to receive
some payment on account immediately they agreed an arrangement and would
receive the balance over a period of time.

FT  17 APR 91 / UK Company News: Sharply reduced losses at LIT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIT HOLDINGS, the transatlantic futures clearing and corporate finance group
which last November agreed a Pounds 26.2m refinancing with its bankers,
yesterday said that it had made a 'promising start' to the current year as
it reported sharply reduced losses for 1990.
The pre-tax deficit was Pounds 344,000. After a Pounds 499,000 extraordinary
credit for realisations net of provisions, retained profit was Pounds
215,000.
LIT said that net borrowings had fallen to Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 51m) by the
year-end, which compared with shareholders' funds of Pounds 6.5m (Pounds
1.2m).
Shareholders' funds were buoyed by Pounds 5.75m worth of convertible capital
bonds issued as part of the refinancing and converted into first preference
shares two months ago.
First preference shareholders will become entitled to their maiden dividend
at the end of June. No dividend for the year is being paid on an old issue
of preference shares or the ordinary shares. Losses per share were 3p.
Mr Christopher Castleman, chief executive, struck a cautiously optimistic
note on current year trading. 'This patient is showing some distinct signs
of life,' he said.
So far profits of LIT America, which provides clearing and other services to
the US futures market, were substantially ahead against a background of weak
commodities markets.
Johnson Fry, the UK financial services company, experienced a jump in
Business Expansion Scheme activity: it had raised Pounds 51m during the
first quarter compared with Pounds 18m in 1990. Enterprise Zone issues were
also up.
Results for 1989 were extensively restated to reflect last year's
restructuring which involved some 30 disposals, releasing about Pounds 35m,
and consolidation of remaining interests into two core businesses.
Mr Castleman said this was compatible with the recommendations on accounting
for discontinued activities made last week by the Accounting Standards
Board.
Restated losses available to ordinary shareholders remain at Pounds 21.2m.
But Pounds 2.6m of what was originally a Pounds 14.2m extraordinary debit
has been brought up into losses before taxation, increasing that figure to
Pounds 4.46m. Losses per share were 13.4p against a previously reported
8.7p.
In 1990, turnover was Pounds 91.14m (Pounds 114.27m). LIT America made
operating profits of Pounds 2.52m (against a restated Pounds 4.04m) and
Johnson Fry Pounds 1.59m (restated Pounds 1.76m). Central costs, which
include a loss of Pounds 421,000 from discontinued activities against a
prior-year profit of Pounds 2.83m, were Pounds 4.45m (Pounds 10.25m).
The refinancing involved, besides an open offer and placing of convertible
capital bonds, preference shares in the holding company for Johnson Fry and
a new medium term loan.

FT  17 APR 91 / Poll tax alternative agreed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A property-based alternative to the poll tax was agreed by a cabinet
committee yesterday. The tax, to be set out as a firm recommendation in a
white paper next week, will be based on the capital values of houses and
flats, with a discount for single-adult households.
Senior ministers, who agreed the details in a two-hour meeting, hope the
plan will neutralise poll tax as a key issue in May's elections.
Mr John Major, who chaired the meeting, sought to reject charges of
'dithering' by listing the decisions he had taken in the past few months. In
a BBC radio interview he singled out the change in policy which had put
Britain 'in the centre of the European debate'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US housing starts fell in March. Does that mean things are getting worse, or
better? At first sight, the figures look terrible: a month-on-month fall of
nearly 10 per cent. Bond futures rose on this slumpish news. Then the
weather men got to work: January was very cold, February was very warm and
in March it was too wet in California to dig a trench. In the end, the
market turned to the weatherproof numbers for building permits, which show
just a hint of recovery. Futures fell again.
Meanwhile, industrial production was down a little less than expected. Good
news? No, the weather again. Heating demand fell in February, then
recovered. One cannot do seasonal adjustment when the seasons themselves are
maladjusted.

FT  17 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's Pounds 500m convertible issue from Hanson was just the thing to
stir a market impatiently waiting for the big takeover bid. But in the
context of a balance sheet already carrying gross debt of Pounds 6.3bn, the
sum scarcely signifies. Perhaps more material is the chance for Hanson to
indulge its favourite trick of borrowing money cheap and depositing it dear:
but after expenses and dilution, even that will make scarcely any difference
to earnings per share.
The fact remains that Hanson, like BTR, needs a big deal before too long. In
view of the recent rise in world markets, it might be argued that it is late
in the game already. But Hanson's standing with the banking community will
doubtless allow it to raise unlimited credit when the time comes. It could
even be argued that, at a time when the market is looking for geared
recovery plays, it is not in Hanson's interest to be held back by cash on
its balance sheet.

FT  17 APR 91 / The Lex Column: British Telecom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent strength of British Telecom's shares is mysterious until one
remembers the government's intention to sell some or all of its remaining 48
per cent stake. An army of brokers has had every reason to push the price
higher and no reason to annoy the authorities. Getting in on privatisations
has been one of the few sure ways to make money in recent years and the
appointment of Warburg as lead adviser leaves plenty of spoils on the table.
Half of the shares' 8 per cent outperformance of the market since the start
of the year occurred after the Budget announcement.
The brokers' arguments, of course, are not so unsubtle. BT's notorious lack
of productivity is due to give way to a leaner organisation, while the
duopoly review was kinder than expected and will have little immediate
effect on BT's profits. This is true as far as it goes. A more objective
view might be that the government faltered when it realised that a harsh
review would undermine the value of its own investment.
Instead, it simply postponed detailed answers to the big questions like
equal access and price re-balancing until 1992 after it has ceased to be a
direct investor. The Treasury is thus free to maximise the sale proceeds,
knowing the industry will only start to see the real implications of
competition some months later. It is presumably not a coincidence that the
regulator is meanwhile quietly keeping his powder dry. Investors should
perhaps be sceptical about any continuing pre-privatisation rally. Other
utilities are both safer and cheaper.

FT  17 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Royal Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given that Royal Insurance chalked up pre-tax losses of Pounds 187m last
year, it might seem odd to sell a subsidiary which actually makes money.
Disposing of Royal Reinsurance, however, is surely the right decision. The
price extracted from General Re - perhaps a little over Pounds 100m - is
secondary. The point is that primary insurers should not be in the highly
specialised, highly risky business of reinsurance unless they are determined
to be really big.
History shows a clear correlation between size and profitability, a lesson
which Legal &amp; General absorbed last year when it sold Victory to the Dutch.
Now that Royal has conceded it has neither the resources nor the expertise
to grow the product or geographical base of Royal Re, perhaps the Pru will
be next to follow suit. Its Mercantile and General might have entered the
big league if all had gone to plan: yesterday's evidence of buyers in the
market could be as good a time as any to bail out.
deal does little to mend its battered balance sheet. This year's bounce in
equities has lifted the solvency margin from 32 per cent to about 40 per
cent; the disposal will not take it much beyond 43 per cent. The company
continues to insist that its Aachener and Munchener stake is not for sale
and that there are no plans for a rights issue. But with premium rates set
to increase and dividends unlikely to be covered for at least another year,
the stock market's health could be crucial.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,519.5 (-23.3)
Yesterday's figures on UK producer prices are perhaps the clearest
indication yet of why UK interest rates are unlikely to fall further in the
immediate future. The March headline figure for manufacturers' output price
inflation of 6.3 per cent - unchanged from the two preceding months - is
plainly at odds with the latest signals on price expectations from the
Confederation of British Industry. But in relation to input prices
especially, the trend is unmistakeable. Throughout 1988 and 1989, the
monthly index number for output prices averaged 1.15 times that for input
prices. It has been rising steadily ever since, and now stands at 1.29
times.
This does not imply any widening of profit margins, since it leaves out of
account the simultaneous acceleration in average earnings. The point is
rather that, despite recession and strong sterling, UK manufacturers seem
broadly to have been able to maintain a cost-plus pricing regime. This also
leaves out of account the fact that the inflationary effect of excess demand
in the late 1980s was mainly seen not in manufacturing but in the service
industries, where the effect is harder to measure. The whole picture remains
hard to reconcile with the tales of distress from the corporate sector. The
government can be forgiven for treading the middle path just the same.

FT  17 APR 91 / Letter: Why an industrial tribunal was moved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Judge TIMOTHY LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested to read Lisa Wood's article (April 12) on the location
of the London Industrial Tribunals. There were some errors in it which I am
happy to correct.
First, the tribunals are independent judicial bodies and it is I, not the
Department of Employment, who shoulders responsibility for their location
and removal.
Second, I have no plans to move the London North Tribunals from their
present address in Woburn Place, WC1. It is one of the two largest tribunal
centres in the country and will continue to serve the needs of the greater
part of London.
Third, it is necessary to move the London South Tribunals because the end of
the lease of their premises is in view. Their catchment area, at present,
stretches to the south coast and will eventually include the area of the
Brighton Tribunal office.
I therefore decided that a move out of central London had a number of
advantages both as to cost and to site the tribunals more centrally in the
region they will serve.
The fact that one of the present chairmen tells your reporter that we are
all 'hopping mad' may have a little to do with their personal convenience.
The region's catchment area remains to be reconsidered and it is a little
premature for the chairmen to decide that the move will be inconvenient to
the tribunal users.
I am confident that most users will find the move rather more convenient and
accessible.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HAROLD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having read the article by Clay Harris about the Association of British
Travel Agents (April 13), I would say that it appears that Mr John
Dunscombe, the association's president, has his priority wrong. Surely the
most important thing ought to be getting back again the holiday-makers
stranded thousands of miles away from their homes.
In view of my terrible experience I feel qualified to count.
Recently, when on an Intasun package holiday in Lanzarote we heard the news
of their failure.
We were not unduly perturbed at the time as it was assumed that Abta would
be taking care of our welfare.
With about a week still to run of the holiday we were abandoned by the
Intasun representative. All Intasun literature was removed from the
apartments, and we were left to fend for ourselves.
In the absence of information, rumours were rife: Abta had gone bankrupt;
they had withdrawn their bond.
Unless we were able to board an airplane by Sunday March 24, we would have
to make our own way home. The efforts to fly us back to England were
pathetic.
When an Abta member company fails, the primary concern of that organisation
ought to be the welfare of stranded holidaymakers. It is appreciated that
this could be a mammoth task and perhaps beyond the resources of the
association.

FT  17 APR 91 / Educating the patient: The pharmaceutical industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERNEST MARIO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the sixth century BC Heraclitus said: 'Nothing endures but change.'
This is certainly true of the prescription pharmaceutical industry. Today we
are witnessing the development of a consumer-led business in prescription
medicines. This is a radical transformation from what previously had been a
supplier-led business.
Thirty years ago, the world of prescription medicines was simple. The
pharmaceutical company invented the medicine, the doctor prescribed it, the
insurer or the government paid for it. In the 1960s and 1970s, the main
markets came, quite rightly, to be regulated by licensing requirements for
safety and efficacy. But in a real sense, the industry proposed and the
doctor disposed.
In those days, once pharmaceutical companies had demonstrated the
usefulness, efficacy and safety of a product to the medical community, they
were home free. On the whole, patients and payers were passive. Companies
talked to the doctors, the doctors talked to the patients and government and
third-party providers were content to be silent partners.
They were content because the pharmaceutical industry could be depended on
to deliver breakthrough after breakthrough. In the 1940s, it was penicillin
6 and streptomycin. In the 1950s, corticosteroids, tetracyclines and
anti-depressants. In the 1960s, it was diuretics and the polio vaccine. In
the 1970s, beta blockers, H-2 antagonists and calcium channel blockers. In
the 1980s, ACE inhibitors, anti-virals and interferon.
But breakthroughs are no longer enough. Doctors, patients, governments and
third-party providers are no longer content. Their discontent is in spite of
the fact that pharmaceutical companies invest 10 years and more than Pounds
100m in every compound they bring to market and are willing to re-invest, on
average, 17 per cent of turnover in research and development. What has
changed?
The answer is simple. Health care costs have exploded from a range of 3 per
cent to 6 per cent in 1960, to a high today in the US of 11 per cent of
gross national product. As a result, there is a new activism among formerly
passive patients and payers to reduce costs - costs that affect them either
in direct out-of-pocket expense or increased upward pressure on taxes. The
pharmaceutical industry must now demonstrate in no uncertain terms that it
provides extraordinary value for health care money spent on medicines.
But how does one define value?
Clearly, the effective use of prescription medicines generates an obvious
and measurable economic value when it keeps people out of hospital and out
of the operating room. But the other benefits of drug therapy - enhanced
productivity, lower costs to employers, improved quality of life for
patients and reduced pressure on health care organisations - are less easy
to quantify.
But quantify them we must if we are to present a full picture of the value
that the pharmaceutical industry provides. Its self-presentation skills are
growing.
Companies have already begun to develop new ways of communicating with the
public both in America and, to a lesser extent, in Europe. These include
press conferences, media tours, media coverage of symposia, video news
releases and discussions with the investment community about new medicines
under development. In the US, direct-to-consumer advertising is becoming
increasingly common - both in print and on television - with the objective
of increasing awareness about disease.
There is evidence that this type of advertising works.
Direct-to-consumer advertising helps to meet the greater demand for health
information prompted by the consumer's increasing awareness of the impact of
the cost of care. It alerts consumers to new treatments, especially for
conditions that were not previously treatable. It encourages people to seek
medical attention. And ultimately it results in a more informed public.
This changing environment and these changing needs are not always perceived.
There are points here to consider when one looks at the EC's draft directive
on advertising for pharmaceuticals. This, in its present form, could
prohibit the pharmaceutical industry from reaching European consumers
directly through public media for the educative purposes I advocate.
I am not suggesting that Europe's airwaves should immediately be filled with
brand-name advertisements for prescription medicines. I still have my doubts
about brand-name advertising for prescription medicines because I believe
that promotional efforts, whatever they may be, must never attempt to
interfere with the physician-patient relationship. Rather, communications
should encourage the patient to consult a physician about appropriate
medical treatment. Educational campaigns in the US - such as Glaxo's on
peptic ulcer disease and Pfizer's 'partners in health care' series - have
demonstrated their ability to do so.
In the new health care environment, education processes must take account of
the value and the crucial public good that the pharmaceutical industry
provides. Whether those processes are provided through public media or in
other ways, the message must reflect the new realities of the pharmaceutical
market place.
A recent Johns Hopkins University study showed that although well-informed
patients were perceived as annoying by most doctors, it was those same
patients who received the best care. In the new health care environment, the
pharmaceutical industry must realise that part of its job is to educate
every patient. If this challenge is met, treatment will improve, compliance
will improve and, moreover, the industry's ability to provide the cures that
people need and demand will continue to be as strong as it is today.

Sir, In his article on the shortcomings of the American education system

FT  17 APR 91 / Letter: UK green card cover can hold its own with European
rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL BUTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The letter from our customer, Mr Michael Russell (Letters, April 11),
took us to task over green card cover.
In fact the Eagle Star policy he holds gives automatic minimum cover in EC
countries and since July 1990 this has been extended to give full UK
equivalence of cover without additional charge for up to 92 days a year,
provided the policyholder advises us beforehand.
I do not, as Mr Russell suggests, complain about competition from French
companies. However, the freedom of access that European companies enjoy in
the open UK markets contrasts starkly with the difficulties that British
insurers face in many European markets.
As to the quality of competition, if Mr Russell compares the cover and price
of his comprehensive, protected bonus Motorstar policy with anything
available on the French market, he might think more favourably of UK
insurers.

FT  17 APR 91 / Letter: Basic cause of inflation of property prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DEREK BROOME
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Much recent comment including your Leader (April 16) overlooks the
basic cause of inflation of house prices and credit - the artificial
restraint on supply imposed by planning regulations.
Current 'values' represent more than double the new building costs of an
average house depreciated at, say, 1 per cent to 2 per cent a year,
representing a premium over agricultural use of land of perhaps 100 times.
In a free market your equity of Pounds 800bn would drop by Pounds 400bn,
bringing the asset value of property to that which could earn a reasonable
return if rented.
Redevelopment of older substandard property would become worthwhile.
No totally free market in land is likely or even desirable, but corrections
for the gross distortions which overprice hovels, and price out the young
and homeless are urgently needed.
Some of the measures you rehearse should be implemented, including capital
gains tax on equity release.
Until the financial services industry as well as householders realise that
'wealth' is Chinese Money unless capable of producing an income, the better.
Much of this lending would have been better directed to industry.

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr ANTHONY KINCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Buchan's article, 'UK Tories win Euro embrace from centre-right',
(April 15), in common with every article I have read on the prospective link
between the Tories and the Christian Democrats in the European Parliament,
studiously avoids mentioning the one issue upon which this 'engagement' will
be broken off.
Members of the EPP Group (The European People's Party) in the European
Parliament who proudly boast that they are 'the heart of Europe' will
certainly demand a form of proportional representation in the United Kingdom
in time for the European elections to be held in 1994.
This is a price no Conservative government can afford to pay.
I am writing to every Christian Democrat member of the parliament reminding
them of their duty to ensure that the 2m or so British European citizens
disenfranchised by our winner-takes-all system of election in 1984 and 1989
have at least the possibility of proper representation in the next
parliament.

Is Edsel Ford II still in the running to head the famous company founded by
his great-grandfather Henry?
Members of the Ford family continue to clamber through the lower echelons of
America's second biggest
carmaker - for example, William Ford was made executive director of business
strategy last month - but Edsel is out in front. Now 42, and having joined
the company in 1974, he has done more than a dozen different jobs before
being just made president of Ford Motor Credit, the world's second largest
finance company.
A couple of years ago young Edsel was complaining bitterly that Donald
Petersen, Ford's non-family chairman, was excluding him from the
influential committees on the company's board. Since then, however, he has
been keeping his head down, and a stint on the finance side is bound to
increase his chance of a shot at the topmost job.

Prime Minister Garret Fitzgerald should know, having spent many hours with

Agreement.
Garret promises to reveal all in his autobiography, due out in the autumn.
He says that out of the book's 350,000 words, at least 50,000 are spent on
the '85 agreement and the fairly robust series of discussions he had on the
subject with Mrs T.
'The trouble she had' says Garret, 'is that she rather liked me.'

He may not rate as high as Kitty Kelley for tittle-tattle but Kjell-Olof
Feldt, Sweden's former finance minister, is disturbing the country's placid
public life with his newly published memoirs.
He was one of the country's few political heavyweights before resigning in
angry despair 14 months ago on failing to convince party colleagues of what
he felt was needed to revive the economy. Now his bitterness has erupted in
a book that will do nothing to help his party's already hopeless chances in
September's general election.
Sweden has known nothing like it. When its politicians produce memoirs, they
are usually produce bland and boring. Moreover, the Social Democrats used to
pride themselves on loyalty and discretion.
Feldt is different; writing of his main party opponent, blue-collar unionist
Stig Malm: 'With him as a friend, who needs enemies'. Feldt's ex-comrades
may well say the same of him as they assess the damage his book will do to
their party's prospects.
Abrasive on the Denis Healey pattern, Feldt likens his 1980s efforts to win
wage-restraint from Sweden's powerful unions to Healey's thankless toil in
UK Labour governments a decade before.
As it happens, Feldt was a visitor to Labour's rumbustious 1980 party
conference and witnessed the events that led to the breakaway of the Social
Democrat 'gang of four'.

FT  17 APR 91 / Observer: Royal coo is Gamble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Insurance's decision to appoint a chief operating officer may not seem
the most earth-shattering event. But it is yet another indication that one
of the weakest of the UK composites is finally trying to put its house in
order before someone else comes to its assistance.
The shiny new 'coo' title goes to Richard Gamble, the 51-year-old finance
director, and although the other executive directors will continue to report
direct to Ian Rushton, the chief executive , Gamble is a man to watch.
Not only is Rushton, at 59, within three years of retirement, but he will
soon be giving a good deal of time to the Association of British Insurers -
he starts a two-year term as chairman in July. So Gamble will be responsible
for seeing that Royal delivers on its much vaunted 'improvement programmes',
which probably means it will have to recruit another finance director.
The new coo is one of the growing breed of wandering financial managers,
having passed through Lowndes Lambert, Data 100, McDonnell Douglas, and
British Airways where he served under Gordon Dunlop, one of Commercial
Union's less successful chief executives. Like him, Gamble is a chartered
accountant, and similarly caused some surprise in an inbred industry when he
was brought in from outside in 1986.
There, however, the similarities end. As Royal's first finance director in
1986, Gamble is regarded as one of those competent money managers who thinks
there is not much difference between an insurance company and an airline
when it comes to running them. What counts is customer-service and squeezing
the cost base.
Having leapfrogged 50-year-old Robin Rowland, a Royal veteran, Gamble is
Rushton's obvious heir apparent, provided he makes a success of his new job.
But as neighbouring Midland Bank has proved many times over, bringing in
outsiders and giving them fancy new titles is the easy bit.

FT  17 APR 91 / Leading Article: The recycled Labour party
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party's latest policy document has many flaws, but its likely
appeal to the electorate should not be underestimated. Only those with long
memories will equate its most alluring phrase 'to build a world-class
economy', with the 'white heat of the technological revolution' as promised
but not delivered by the then Mr Harold Wilson in 1964. The principal means
of achieving the freshly-stated objective is to be further investment in
education and training, although Labour has surrounded that strategy with a
plethora of other proposals, some aimed at particular interest groups, such
as pensioners, and others intended to demonstrate the party's green or civic
credentials.
To complete the package there is a range of constitutional proposals, from
the establishment of a Scottish assembly and regional authorities to a 'new
charter of rights' and a freedom of information act. London will get its own
local authority. These proposals fall a long way short of constituting a
restraint on the powers of the executive. This is hardly surprising, since
both the Labour leader, Mr Neil Kinnock, and his deputy, Mr Roy Hattersley,
plainly intend to exercise as much central authority as any previous
government.
Apparent miracle
There is, however, a little something for everyone. More on health, more on
pensions, more on education - all are promised. This miracle is apparently
to be achieved without falling into the trap of profligate spending. The
constraints of Britain's membership of the exchange rate mechanism are
recognised. Although public investment must 'have a higher claim than tax
cuts', the document is peppered with statements of prudent fiscal intent.
The Budget and the annual expenditure plans will be coalesced into a single
document. Income will be taxed on a rising scale from 20 per cent to 50 per
cent, while the ceiling on national insurance contributions will be
abolished - although this latter impost will not be extended to pensioners,
as it was in earlier documents.
Many questions arise. The Heseltinian formula for a 'partnership with
industry' is carefully circumscribed, but it is not clear where partnership
ends and old-fashioned interventionism begins. The national minimum wage can
hardly increase employment. The array of new quangos - from 'Skills UK' to
the proposed 'National Investment Bank' - is daunting.
Union practice
The promised reforms of trade union legislation may reflect continental
practice, but how would a Labour government stand up to a challenge on pay
initiated by, say, Nalgo or Nupe? For all its moves towards the centre
ground of politics, Labour remains the party of new authorities, new
regulations, new taxes or charges and a halt to privatisation.
Yet the Conservatives are in no position to deride any of this. They are
still struggling to divest themselves of the poll tax, let alone produce a
credible post-Thatcher manifesto. Some of their ideas are derived from the
opposition's proposals, most notably the contemporary favourite known as
'contractualisation'.
This means using individual contracts to govern the relationship between
customers of public services and the providing agencies. Under Mr John
Major's guidance Tory ministers are as effusive as Labour about the need to
improve health, education and similar services, but, 'contractualisation'
apart, they are unconvincing about how the task can be done without
increasing taxes.
Indeed the chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, goes further. In his speech to the
Adam Smith Institute last week he repeated the Tory pledge to reduce the
basic rate of income tax to 20p as a 'firm objective for the medium term'
and stressed that 'we do not believe that the solution to the undoubted
problems of the public sector lies in ever more public spending'. During the
election campaign a reasonable question for Labour to ask will be, if that
is the case, how will the Conservatives further improve education, health
and the other elements of public infrastructure?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S report on Euro-pean Community trade policy by the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is refreshingly robust. Though few will be
surprised by the thrust of the report's criticisms of the EC, it can only be
healthy for the trading system that they should be brought into the open.
On the positive side, the Gatt is right to point out that the EC has so far
resisted the temptation to build a trade fortress round its single market.
Tariffs are relatively low in the Community and third countries are able to
share, through trade, in the benefits created by its internal
liberalisation.
Yet the Gatt's misgivings about EC trade policy are also valid. They deserve
to be taken all the more seriously given the fragility of the trading system
following last year's failure to complete the Uruguay Round on time, to
which the EC contributed so much.
The EC does, as the Gatt complains, suffer from a tendency to respond to
particular trade problems with targeted bilateral solutions - abuse of its
anti-dumping rules, for example, or recourse to voluntary restraint
arrangements. It does also operate a complex web of discriminatory
preferential arrangements with the European Free Trade Association,
Mediterranean countries and developing nations.
The EC's reply that it is still a large importer, even of the most heavily
restricted products such as farm goods, textiles, steel and cars is lame.
Nor is it any excuse to defend one's own barriers on the grounds that others
have restrictions too.
The true message underlying the report is that there is a culture of
protectionism at work in the EC. Whatever the record on Fortress Europe
until now, there is a danger that this culture will come to dominate as the
Uruguay Round grows more difficult.
Increased protection
Already, there are unpleasant signs of protection gaining ground. After a
period of apparent restraint, the Commission's traditional sleight of hand
is reappearing in calculating dumping margins on video cassettes and tapes.
The number of dumping cases in the pipeline has swollen, while the granting
of such procedural forms of protection remains too obscure in both its
underlying rationale and its results.
To its shame the EC has also baulked at opening up its borders to farm
products, textiles and steel from the emerging market economies of eastern
Europe. There could scarcely be a better way of undermining the political
reforms so earnestly sought by the west for more than four decades.
Higher stakes
When its country reviews were launched two years ago, the Gatt trumpeted
them as means of exerting pressure against the worst protectionist
tendencies of its members. Until now the Gatt's timidity has made the weapon
largely ineffective. Its suddenly more outspoken style reflects a world
where the stakes have grown immeasurably higher.
The hopes in Brussels and other European capitals that the Uruguay Round can
be wrapped up this year are still just hopes. There is as yet no sign of the
necessary breakthrough on farm subsidies, something that only the EC can
provide. The worst the EC could do would be to add a willingness to cave in
to its other protectionist lobbies to its failure to come up with a
satisfactory offer on farming.
This would produce the kind of vicious cycle of action and retaliation that
the Uruguay Round was supposed to prevent, rendering the chance of
completing the talks ever more remote.
There is a striking contrast between the push for internal liberalisation of
Europe's markets and the way its industries prefer to cling to external
barriers. The external walls must be broken down too to secure the full
benefit of the single market.
Europe must stop looking to the practices of others as justification for its
own shortcomings and start to fight the rot from within. It can start by
improving its farm offer in the Gatt, by eliminating barriers to imports
from eastern Europe and by increasing its determination to resist the cries
of its protectionist lobbies.

FT  17 APR 91 / Mixed signals on the wages front: John Gapper examines the
changing climate of pay bargaining in Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All is not well at Gates Rubber Company in Dumfries. The recession in
Britain has depressed sales of Wellington boots and carpet underlay. Workers
at the plant started an overtime ban last week after the company delayed
April pay negotiations until at least July. 'They have had a lot of good
years from us, and they should stick with us in the bad times,' says Mr
George McGauchie, president of the GMB general union branch.
The discord at Gates is a symptom of the sudden change in the UK pay
climate. The uniformity of private sector deals at the end of last year has
fractured under the pressures of recession, combined with entry to the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Many companies are
offering less than the 'going rate' of between 9 and 10 per cent. Pay has
been frozen in troubled industries: Trusthouse Forte's hotels, the Guardian
newspaper, road haulage companies, and International Business Machines.
This change of mood has prompted some hope that reforms of the British
labour market in the 1980s have enabled it to respond more rapidly to
economic shocks. Confederation of British Industry leaders believe companies
have responded to their call to break the link between pay deals and the
rate of inflation; ministers have spoken with approval of pay freezes.
The CBI believes it has detected a distinct change of behaviour among pay
bargainers this year. Manufacturing deals in its pay databank averaged 8.3
per cent in the first quarter of this year, compared with 8.9 in the last
quarter of 1990. 'With inflation turning down and order books much thinner,
the downward pressures on pay have been growing rapidly,' says Mr Robbie
Gilbert, the CBI's deputy director of employment affairs.
Some unions are feeling a chiller wind. The Amalgamated Engineering Union
represents many of the skilled manual workers who did well out of the
overheating of the British labour market in the late 1980s. Mr Gavin Laird,
AEU general secretary, says most settlements reported to the union in the
past few week have been about 7 or 8 per cent. 'Once unemployment rises, pay
aspirations are overtaken by fears of job loss. That's the incomes policy
we've always lived with,' he says.
Some managers have grown both more confident about containing pay, and more
afraid of the consequences for profitability of not doing so. About 5 per
cent of West Midlands engineering companies had managed to freeze pay
without provoking industrial action, in the last sounding taken by the
Engineering Employers' Federation. 'People have got the message that the
economy is not well. They might rattle sabres a bit, but they are not going
to go over the top,' says Mr Cedric Thomas, the regional EEF director.
As constraints on raising prices have grown because of the recession,
companies have looked for ways of offsetting pay increases by other
reductions in labour costs. Retailers have cut working hours, and
manufacturing companies have tried to raise productivity. W H Smith, the
retail chain, raised the wages of 10,000 staff by 8.3 per cent in February;
at the same time it agreed a temporary 4 per cent cut in working hours to
keep the overall pay bill increase down to 4.3 per cent during the
recession.
There has also been evidence of the discretionary element in pay through
individual merit rises being curtailed. Woolworth ended pay rises for staff
completing training courses last month. Together with hours cuts and a fall
in overtime working, this has already sharply cut the customary 'drift' in
earnings above the level of pay settlements. The example of W H Smith could
be followed elsewhere, leading to a national trend for earnings' rises to be
below basic pay settlements.
But despite these signs that some employers are changing their pay strategy
markedly, there are indications that parts of the British labour market are
behaving much the same as ever. Pay bargaining early this year is remarkably
similar to that 10 years ago during the last recession. The Incomes Data
Services (IDS) pay research group reported in January 1981 that most deals
were dropping to between 5 and 10 per cent as inflation fell. Four West
Midlands engineering companies had imposed pay pauses; pay talks had been
delayed for four months at another rubber processing plant, Avon Rubber in
Melksham.
Mr Alastair Hatchett of lDS says pay settlements so far this year show no
decisive break with the past. Deals have been spread over a wider range but
at a uniformly lower level. Most during February and March were at more than
9 per cent, although the proportion worth above 10 per cent fell to less
than a third. There are still high pay deals in the public sector, in the
retail sector and even in manufacturing where companies are negotiating
changes in working practices.
The public sector is still catching up with the surge of private sector pay
in the past two years as comparability deals - based on private sector rises
 -take effect. Although health service groups covered by pay bargaining are
being offered settlements of about 7.9 per cent, there have been rises of up
to 14.6 per cent for National Health Service ancillaries. Pay offers to more
than 300,000 civil servants provide for rises of between 7.6 and 7.8 per
cent from April 1 in a month when inflation is expected to fall to below 7
per cent.
A second form of pay lag can be seen in the private retail sector, where
companies are still settling at high levels because of job evaluation
studies carried out to protect companies from equal pay claims from women
staff. This is proving expensive for many employers. The supermarket chain
Tesco agreed a pay deal worth between 13 and 14 per cent in February; rises
of up to 17.7 per cent were given to the female-dominated jobs of sales
assistant and till operator.
This is one reason why the pay clampdown has been less pronounced in the
service sector than in manufacturing this year. Mr Bill Connor, deputy
general-secretary of the shopworkers' union Usdaw, is less daunted by the
recession than Mr Laird. 'I would not say we are ecstatic, but we are
quietly pleased at the level of settlements so far this year,' he says.
Although deals have been worse outside food retailing, he says the union is
'not disheartened yet'.
Nor have manufacturing companies abandoned the 1980s habit of giving big pay
rises in return for changes in working practices which will raise
productivity. Imperial Chemical Industries last month offered its 23,000
manual workers a 12 per cent rise in basic pay over two years for agreeing
flexible working; Lever Brothers, the detergents subsidiary of Unilever, has
offered workers a 12 per cent rise in exchange for wide-ranging changes in
working practices.
Perhaps the biggest uncertainty raised by the holding down of pay in the
private sector is the pressures it will create for the future. The staging
of pay rises to reduce the overall wages bill this year will in turn add to
next year's costs. Michelin offered workers at its Stoke-on-Trent tyre plant
an 11 per cent rise last month after imposing a pay pause at the start of
the year. Similar pay clampdowns in the last recession led inexorably to
catch-up rises later on.
All this suggests that economic pressures may have fractured many of the
conventional approaches to pay bargaining of the 1980s without establishing
a coherent reform. Some workers have been forced to accept lower wage rises
by fears of unemployment and cost pressures on companies. They are likely to
be storing up demands for the future. Other employees are emerging from
recession with relatively little difficulty because their employers are
profitable or their skills are still rare.
The test for employers such as Gates Rubber Company may come later this year
if recession eases as inflation falls. The demands of exchange rate
stability inside the EMS suggests wage increases must stabilise at below 5
per cent. If the engine of wage growth in the British economy has settled
into a lower gear after this year's shocks, they may do so. If the engine
has only stalled for a time, there will be another acceleration to face.

year, UK unemployment has risen to l97m and is likely to reach 2.5m later in
the year. Most forecasters believe wage inflation will stay above 9 per cent
for the year, outstripping retail inflation of about 6 per cent.
The labour market is unlikely to respond to recession fast enough to prevent
unemployment rising.
After a decade of official hostility to any form of central pay policy, and
constant calls from ministers for wage bargains to be devolved to company
level, Mr John Major's government last month showed the first hint of a
change of tack. His policy unit invited the Campaign for Work lobby group to
explain its support for national pay co-ordination.
Although the invitation was cancelled when it became public, it was a token
of renewed government interest in pay co-ordination. Its supporters argue
that countries such as Japan, Germany and Australia have gained from an
annual discussion of the affordable level of pay settlements involving
employers, unions and government. This has allowed them to limit rises in
unemployment and to keep inflation under control without statutory wage
limits.
Mr Peter Robinson, a consultant to the Campaign for Work, argues that the
fragmentation of UK pay bargaining has prevented the British economy
reacting in the best manner to recession. 'The fall in wage rises so far has
been bought at a cost of 10 per cent unemployment, and that will not be
enough,' he says. 'If inflation is to go down further, it will need
unemployment of 12 or 13 per cent, and the experience of France is that that
will become a permanent plateau.'
UK support for pay co-ordination has emphasised the role it could play in
establishing a pay norm consistent with low unemployment. In spite of this
emphasis on wage control, there has been more support from unions and the
Labour party than from employers or government.
The prime backer in the union movement has been Mr John Edmonds, leader of
the GMB general union, who last year gained limited support for the idea
from the Trades Union Congress. Yet resistance has grown within the TUC from
an alliance of left-wing union suspicious of incomes policy, and right-led
craft unions organising in manufacturing. The latter group fears pay
co-ordination will benefit the low-paid at the expense of skilled workers.
The Labour party has been careful to dissociate itself publicly from the
idea of wage controls, but supports the idea of a 'national economic
assessment' each year before wage bargaining. Mr Edmonds says the idea is a
means of delivering higher real wage increases rather than battling for big
rises which are nullified by price inflation. 'It is to do with the relation
between wages and inflation. It is a means of getting decent real
increases,' he says.
The Confederation of British Industry remains suspicious of the idea, seeing
echoes of the ineffective pay restraint agreements of the early 1970s. It
wants individual companies to settle increases on what they can afford. It
seems unlikely to gain convincing backing from the TUC this year. 'It is
another good idea which could help the economy, but may end up withering on
the vine through lack of support,' says Mr Edmonds.

FT  17 APR 91 / Arts: Top Girls - Royal Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

<TEXT>
On the one hand . . . ; on the other . . . This is a superlative revival of
Caryl Churchill's important 1982 play, which has gained new resonance in
1991; and one of its several first-rate performances is haunting. Yet I
can't accept it as the great play it has been, and is still being, called.
It should be seen, applauded and argued about.
Both as theatre and as politics, Top Girls is exciting and irritating. The
dialectic of its final scene, between the Thatcherite Marlene and her
socialist sister Joyce rings true as you listen. The terms in which the
sisters argue about Thatcherite politics have not dated. Here are the two
nations of the 1980s: those who've got what it takes and those who haven't.
And, of course, Marlene now resembles a later prime minister when she says
'I don't believe in class.'
But the more evidently Top Girls expresses a Point of View, the worse as
theatre it is. How glibly, in that final scene, Churchill weights the dice
against Marlene's Thatcherism. I resent theatre that weights the scales that
easily, whichever way. I think also that Top Girls occasionally exemplifies
the noisy slickness that it criticises.
Indeed, what makes the play so striking is its own ambition. The first scene
will always be its most startling feature, with Marlene celebrating her
recent ascent to the directorship of the Top Girls appointments agency by
throwing a not-of-this-world dinner for five famous women from history. The
women, so different in their attitudes, are a miniature Babel. They drive
you up the wall as they talk across each other, but they also hilariously
illustrate Marlene's dilemma: who should an ambitious woman take as a role
model? What must be sacrificed?
I have nothing but high, higher and highest praise for the seven actresses
in this revival of Max Stafford-Clark's original production. Part of the
play's considerable fun is in how brilliantly six of them take two or more
dissimilar roles. Lesley Manville, who is the central figure of Marlene,
neatly captures her brittle elegance and ambition. Very fine the wry,
defensive way she resorts to drink as things get out of hand. Lesley Sharp
is Dull Gret ('painted by Breugel') and Angie. Her expression of
inarticulate and half-comprehending emotion, now stolid, now inarticulate,
is funny, poignant and viscerally exciting.
Best of all, though, is Deborah Findlay. The details of eye and voice she
brings to the Victorian explorer Isabella, suavely martyr-like, and the
tense, conservative and domestic Mrs Kidd are remarkable. And as Joyce -
like Sharp, she has an uncannily perfect Suffolk accent - she is
exceptional. She shows a powerful countrywoman weightiness and a smouldering
force that are deeply stirring.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To go as an opera-lover to Carmen Jones might seem to be tempting fate even
more flagrantly than Carmen does herself. There is a belief, hopefully
misplaced, that those who appreciate opera in its traditional form will be
outraged by any adaptation, even one as successful as Oscar Hammerstein II's
version of this favourite Bizet masterpiece.
The problem, though, generally lies with the adaptations. In recent years we
have seen well-meaning attempts to cross the cultural barrier with The
Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni (the former made it to the West End,
briefly) but they remained apologies for the real thing, less well sung than
an opera, not so much fun as a musical. Carmen Jones is not like them. It
throws its inhibitions aside in the wings and takes the stage as if it owns
it.
This London production opened last week and on Monday night introduced its
second cast, the one with a 'show-biz' element, rather than all opera
singers. This brought us a brash and glamorous Carmen in Sharon Benson, a
bit too keen to be the star of the show perhaps but full of life, and a
touchingly plain and honest Joe in the operatic tenor Michael Austin. He has
all the notes, while she struggles from time to time in the upper voice, but
both know how to put the music across.
And for that they must thank Bizet and Mr Hammerstein in just about equal
measure. In this version, music and story are transported to the Deep South
in the dark days of World War II. Bizet's cigarette factory in Seville
becomes a parachute factory, where black manual labour works to sustain the
war effort over lazy, jazz-inspired choruses, while the lure of gypsy life
in the mountains is replaced by the bright lights of Chicago. How well it
all works, too, after updatings at the opera-house, like Pountney's
unconvincing street-cred Carmen at ENO.
The world of Hammerstein's black America affords an entertaining milieu.
There is a touching Cindy Lou from Karen Parks and the towering Gregg Baker,
a fine baritone, is a natural for the heavyweight champion Husky Miller; but
it is the wealth of fine performances in the smaller roles, mostly well
directed by Simon Callow, that gives this musical its depth of character.
With Henry Lewis, a longtime expert in Carmen and Carmen Jones in charge in
the pit, there was never any worry that the music would fail to flare into
life. It is not his fault that the last scene is so weak. Hammerstein,
mindful no doubt of the stamina of his singers, cut the last duet to the
point where the music that remains can in no way carry the action, and the
two lead players fatally let the drama slip through their fingers. Otherwise
this is a fun show.

The central idea in Sleepers, of two Soviet agents, posted to Britain in
1966 and forgotten, who have become pillars of their respective communities
 -the City and a northern brewery - is so good that the details scarcely
matter. However, the details in the first episode were also pretty
impressive, so this looks like being an unusually successful spy comedy
(9.25 BBC2). The BBC has produced a documentary about policing in South
Africa. No doubt you realised that when black policemen hit black citizens
over the head it is not worth making programmes about it. And when the
police come overwhelmingly from one tribe and the policed overwhelmingly
from another that doesn't matter either, unless their skins are different
colours. Then it matters terribly . Hence, presumably, tonight's Inside
Story concentrating on the Cape Town riot unit. Unfortunately the version of
Brimstone And Treacle being shown in C4's 'Banned' festival (11.00) is the
one made for the cinema with Sting in the diabolical role. The BBC
television version was superior.

FT  17 APR 91 / Arts: Opening concerts - Symphony Hall, Birmingham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Simon Rattle and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra took full
possession of Symphony Hall on Monday. They played two one-work concerts -
the complete Stravinsky Firebird at 7.30, and (with the CBSO Chorus) the
complete Ravel Daphnis and Chloe at 9.15 - for two different audiences; this
was a good, fair way of attempting to satisfy overwhelming demand.
Just now, Birmingham is in a state of high excitement about its new
possession. In purely musical terms, I must insist that any flush of pride
the city may be allowing itself is more than justified. Whatever one may
feel about the look of the building - and I completely share Colin Amery's
sense of disappointment as expressed in these columns on Monday - in the end
it is only the sound of the music that really matters. (In fairness to the
architects it should be noted that the seats are extremely comfortable, the
sight-lines are excellent, the leg-room satisfies even a six-footer, and
entrances and exits are quickly effected.)
The lucky critic who attended both halves of Monday evening can confirm,
temperately, the conclusion that Brummies are no doubt already shouting from
the rooftops: in acoustical terms the new hall is a plain triumph. Listening
from a central stalls seat to the Firebird, I thrilled to the music in a way
I have not done since first getting to know it in early adolescence. Later
on, listening from a seat at the back of the first circle to the Daphnis, I
was able more calmly to list and admire the linked achievements of Russell
Johnson and Artec, the hall's team of acousticians.
The sound of the orchestra seemed to possess ideal space, depth, intimacy,
and clarity across a wide range of pitches and dynamics: in both seats - and
this is the true miracle - it reached me as a physical presence naturally
proportioned and positioned, with no lacks, gaps, artificial 'gramophonic'
adjustments, or internal imbalances.
In all the chamber-musical passages at the start of the Stravinsky ballet
(whispering low strings, single woodwind strands, sudden faint percussion
flickers and keyboard flutters) the softness of the playing was as it always
should be: almost out of earshot and at the same time intensely 'real' and
colourful. Similarly, the soft choral humming in the Ravel had an ideal
degree of definition. In the encores played at the end of both concerts -
orchestral versions of two Satie Gymnopedies - the hushed delicacy was
simply hypnotic.
Whereas in the Festival Hall even the most finely projected soft playing
tends to evaporate, and in the Barbican even the most carefully focused loud
can so easily become clotted, the dynamic range of both these performances
was a sustained marvel of corporate artistry given sufficient room and time
to express itself. Rattle's Daphnis was here far more spacious, more
leisurely in its unfolding, than it has been elsewhere; clearly, Symphony
Hall - which has been intentionally influenced in its acoustical planning by
the sound-qualities of those auditoria (in Amsterdam and Berlin, inter alia)
in which the CBSO has most enjoyed performing - is a place where the
grandest musical constructions can be built up without need for hustling the
pace.
The built-in variables of the auditorium shell (the roof platform capable of
being lowered to suit smaller forces, the extra resonance chambers that can
be opened for the largest combinations) have still to be tested before the
public. Now one is keen to know how a concerto soloist will sound, a single
singer, the organ, a group of 'period' strings and winds. Many visits to
Symphony Hall will be required to discover if there is indeed a limit to its
seemingly limitless possibilities.
But what is already clear, from these opening-night experiences, is that the
musical life of Birmingham has received a boost of unimaginable force; and
that the partnership of Rattle and the CBSO, for long this country's most
exciting, is at the start of its golden era.

<TEXT>
Few (if any other) women in television have had a career as impressive as
Verity Lambert's. Brought on in the early 1960s by that great Canadian
promoter of talent, Sydney Newman, when he was head of BBC Television's
drama group, she had a lot to do with the creation of Dr Who and Adam
Adamant. With London Weekend in the 70s she produced Budgie, and then as
controller of drama at Thames in the 70s and 80s was responsible for Rock
Follies, Rumpole Of The Bailey, Edward and Mrs Simpson, The Naked Civil
Servant and several series of Minder.
Her time with EMI films was less impressive but since she set up her own
company Cinema Verity (ho ho) in 1985 the familiar knack has been evident
again. The comedy-detective series Boys From The Bush set in Australia is
hers, as was Coasting, also a combination of crime and comedy. Now BBC2 is
showing her Sleepers, a slick and amusing spy spoof with Nigel Havers and
Warren Clarke as a couple of KGB agents, planted in British society in 1966,
and now flourishing as stalwart native plants (Episode 2 tonight).
Miss Lambert is clearly a shrewd businesswoman as well as an astute
producer. And yet . . . and yet . . . Dr Who was a radical departure in its
day, as was Budgie in some respects, and it took courage to bring The Naked
Civil Servant to the screen with its explicit account of Quentin Crisp's
exhibitionist homosexuality; everybody including the BBC had rejected it
before Lambert accepted it. Would it be too much to ask now that she become
a brave independent, taking a few similar risks to break some new ground? If
she won't, who will?
* * *
The fashionable reaction to the interviewing of a politician on television
does not change: the sneer is still de rigueur. After Sue Lawley's interview
with John Major at 10 Downing Street there was much vying to see who could
pour most cold water, much of it, admittedly, on Lawley: she had remarked on
the absence of Iain Macleod from the Downing Street portraits yet, in the
immortal words of Molesworth, any fule kno Macleod wasn't PM (she never said
he was); she was chatty (wasn't that the idea?); she showed off her legs
(they are very good legs); she looked insultingly relaxed (would it have
been better to look tense?)
As for Mr 'Ordinary' Major, his ear tugging, mouth covering and leg crossing
shrieked of deceit, and who could possibly believe a man who claimed not to
remember how many O-levels he had passed? Anyone who, like me, read the
reactions next day before watching a tape of the interview would have been
ready for some impertinent sexpot rabbiting away to an evasive phoney.
Nothing could have been further from the truth. Lawley is so good at this
sort of interview now that she has, it seems, fooled many onlookers into
imagining they are easy. To be able to relax enough to reveal the true
temperament of your interviewee, and to listen closely enough to switch
questions in mid stream, takes not just confidence but practice. Lawley has
lots of both.
As for Major he did, indeed, come across as extraordinarily ordinary for a
prime minister, which is probably what irritates his detractors (why him,
why not me?) but the interview was remarkably revealing. It was certainly
more interesting than this week's Panorama which was so determined to dish
the dirt that it rambled on about some supposed misdemeanour over address
registration when Major stood as a local councillor years ago, a petty
little point the inclusion of which reflected worse on the programme than on
Major. I write as a wholly biased onlooker, of course, being another of
those who cannot remember whether he passed six, seven, or eight O-levels.
* * *
Last week's column said that The Darling Buds Of May with its old fashioned
qualities of optimism and good humour and its lack of murders, lawyers and
policemen, would probably prove immensely popular: it would be no surprise
if the series attracted an audience of 10.5m and went up from there. In fact
Episode 1 blasted past every other programme on the box to take No 1 slot in
AGB's BARB ratings with an audience of 16.68m - above Coronation Street,
above EastEnders, above Neighbours. Interesting what sunshine, a happy
attitude, and David Jason in the lead role can do.
* * *
Stand by, then, for a couple more predictions: when people have finished
watching the Larkins in the 1950s Darling Buds Of May they will switch,
lickety split, to BBC1 to catch the greater part of the series of Noel
Coward one-act plays, Tonight At 8.30, written in the 1930s. These contain
very few lawyers or policemen, no murders that I can see, and each one stars
Joan Collins who, though no female Olivier, does seem to stack up the
ratings. The first in the series, 'Hands Across The Sea,' was astoundingly
slight (about four good lines) but utterly undemanding and good humoured.
When these finish, many viewers will switch immediately to Jeeves And
Wooster on ITV, the series based on PG Wodehouse's stories from the 1920s.
In the opening episode of the new series the stout policeman fell in the
duckpond and came up spouting water and holding a frog, and the judge was a
blithering idiot. There were no murders and the sun shone. I think we can
safely predict even more big drama ratings for Sunday nights.
* * *
The more television there is, and the larger the number of people drawn in
as presenters, the clearer it becomes that it takes abnormal strength of
character to resist the pressure to become a 'loveable exhibitionist' once
it is known that the camera likes your face - and, more important, your
manner. AJP Taylor successfully withstood the trial, as the Saturday night
repeats of his BBC history lectures from the 1970s are proving. Patrick
Moore, though willing to clown around with a xylophone on chat shows,
continues to present The Sky At Night in his utterly informal manner, sans
Autocue, but without ever becoming an insufferable 'personality.'
Unhappily the same cannot be said of Keith Floyd. In his early cookery
series he used his natural wit to compensate for a lack of television
experience by developing a teasing relationship with the cameraman ('Down
here Clive, let the viewers see the chopping board') and that was delightful
while unforced and occasional. Now, in his new series about Australian food
on BBC2, Floyd On Oz, he is showing saddening signs of turning into one of
those boring telly eccentrics like Lucinda Lambton or Magnus Pyke, condemned
to repeat his own matinee tricks ad infinitum. The scenery is good, his
cooking continues to be admirably unfussy, and the programmes are still
entertaining, but the charming spontaneity of the early programmes is in
danger of being replaced by a studied mannerism.
* * *
The cumulative effect of 'Banned', Channel 4's fascinating season of
persecuted programmes and films, is bafflement and rage. By what right did
anybody ever presume to prevent us seeing Scum, a drama directed by Alan
Clarke from a script by Roy Minton, which gives a vivid impression of the
Darwinian nature of survival in one of Her Majesty's Borstals? Note the word
'impression': no doubt there are exaggerations, approximations, and even
misrepresentations here, as in Monet's pictures, but in both cases the
artifice is the lie which endeavours to convey a greater truth.
At least with Juvenile Liaison II (a revised and expanded version by Nick
Broomfield and Joan Churchill of their never-seen 1976 programme about
police treatment of child offenders in Blackburn) you could see why the
police had worked so hard to suppress the original. It clearly was a
one-sided account. But perhaps just occasionally that is what an account
ought to be if one side is crying out for public exposure because of its
beastliness or wrong headedness. From the public point of view this dreadful
situation should have been made general knowledge 15 years ago.

FT  17 APR 91 / Management (Managing in Recession): How Wiggins built a
future for itself - Property has been hard hit in today's straitened times.
Vanessa Houlder reports on how different organisations coped

<TEXT>
As the property market continues to spiral into one of the steepest
downturns ever seen in the UK, many debt-laden property companies are
desperately seeking financial reconstructions.
One of the first companies to do this in the current downturn was Wiggins, a
Docklands-based housebuilder and developer. It has survived, but the
protracted, complex negotiations that led to its refinancing illustrate the
predicament of developers and their banks.
Wiggins ran into trouble in late 1989, when the sale of a hotel it was
building in the Isle of Dogs enterprise zone fell through. That left it
over-extended and just a few months off a cash-flow crisis.
Before starting negotiations with its bank, Wiggins wanted to formulate
proposals of its own. It called in a firm of lawyers, D J Freeman, which
helped it grapple with the complexities of its financial and legal
situation.
'It was like going through a maze that had only one route through it,'
according to Stephen Hayklan, the chairman. The inter-related nature of
Wiggins' finances meant that the failure of the hotel project was
jeopardising the whole group.
'Different banks held different forms of security, sometimes over the same
assets and held different guarantees from other members of the group,' says
Jonathan Lewis, head of corporate restructuring at D J Freeman. 'If any one
demand were made and enforced, the whole group would collapse.'
The aim of the restructuring was to protect the rest of the group from
failure of the Docklands projects. It did this by 'ringfencing' each
development, putting it into a separate single purpose company to stand or
fall by its own merits. To do this, it had to renegotiate all the parent
company's guarantees, a move which had to overcome the banks' instinctive
desire for as much security as possible.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, were asked to scrutinise the proposals.
'We provided them with our plans and said be as tough as you want on our
projections and anticipations,' says Hayklan.
Meanwhile, the directors tried to sell as much as they could. Geoffrey
Lansbury, the managing director, tried to sell the hotel while Paul
Lewellen, the finance director, worked on the business units. Hayklan's task
was to sell the group's French property - and to fetch takeaways when the
team was working late at night. 'It was very fraught,' he says. 'Everybody
forgot about their home life.'
Construction work on a business unit complex in Docklands stopped but the
rest of the group traded as normal. The group sold its projects in France,
Spain and Florida, raising about Pounds 7m. The decision to sell sites, on
which great hopes had been pinned, was not easy. 'It was heart-breaking,'
says Hayklan. 'But had we been greedy or emotional about it we probably
would not have survived.'
Wiggins met its banks in early March. Thirty people - the bankers, the
syndicate's lawyers, Wiggins' lawyers and Coopers &amp; Lybrand - sat around a
symmetrically arranged square table. 'It was very formal,' recalls Lewis.
Wiggins presented its proposals and answered questions. Its directors and
advisers then withdrew to an antechamber. Eventually they were invited to
return, to be told that the syndicate needed more time for deliberation.
That was the start of several months of negotiations with the banks and
contractors. The negotiations on the hotel were simplified by the fact that
there was only one bank involved, Midland. On the business unit complex,
however, it had to deal with a syndicate.
Even a small syndicate presents problems in a restructuring. Each bank is
likely to take a different attitude, given the differences in their lending
books and financial muscle. The involvement of overseas banks can be
complicated because of longer internal reporting lines, response times and
less flexible insolvency practices.
'The problems arose in trying to persuade banks with different cultures to
think along the same lines,' says Chris Day, a manager at Samuel Montagu
which, as the agent, was responsible for co-ordinating the syndicate,
reconciling difficulties and maintaining the timetable.
It was a long, slow process. At every twist and turn, the banks had to go
back to their credit committees which would demand modifications; these
would prove controversial and lead to more negotiations. 'More than once the
situation looked hopeless,' says Lewis.
One low point was when South Quay Plaza, a large office development three
doors down from Wiggins' office project, went into receivership. Another was
when one of the overseas banks dropped out, disillusioned with the UK
property market. Even though the bank took a co-operative stance and allowed
its security to be diluted, its decision was a blow. 'One of the unwritten
rules of syndicated banking is together we stand or together we fall,' says
Ian Steer, a director at Samuel Montagu.
Wiggins and its lawyers were picking their way through a legal minefield. If
there had been 'no reasonable prospect' of avoiding collapse, the board
would have been at risk of wrongful trading.
The directors would also be in breach of their duties if they preferred one
creditor over another for anything but sound business reasons. 'Just because
someone is shouting at you for payment doesn't mean you pay them before
someone who is more understanding of the situation,' says Lewellen.
Transferring assets within the group was also hazardous, because every
subsidiary is deemed to have a separate legal personality. Each deal had to
be done on an arm's length basis and the new subsidiaries had to consider
the obligations they were undertaking and their ability to honour them.
If a court considered that the directors had slipped up in any way, the
sanctions could be serious - 'a very real inducement to directors to be safe
rather than brave,' according to Lewis. The directors could be held
personally liable and their conduct would automatically be the subject of a
report by the liquidator to the Department of Trade and Industry. If there
was any misconduct, the board members could be disqualified from acting as a
director for as long as 15 years.
In addition to these risks, Wiggins had to face the possibility that
negotiations would break down or an unsecured creditor might present a
winding-up petition. As a contingency plan, Wiggins prepared to apply for an
administration order.
Over four months, they thrashed out a solution. 'The banks accepted it was
the best way forward,' says Lewellen. 'The exit route showed that they had a
good chance of coming out with their loans intact over less than two years.'
The syndicate put in an extra Pounds 36m, which more than doubled its
exposure and Wimpey, the management contractor, agreed to defer Pounds 5m
owing to it. The interest varied with the eventual profit on the
development. In addition, Wimpey and Robert McAlpine, a 20 per cent
shareholder, gave guarantees. Hayklan also stepped into the breach when
there was a shortfall and personally guaranteed Pounds 500,000.
The hotel was refinanced on August 15 and sold in early November to
Britannia Hotels, a Manchester-based group. Wiggins was unable to complete
the construction as it had hoped, and the sale price was just Pounds 17.75m,
resulting in a loss of Pounds 6m.
In September, the Docklands business unit complex, called the Eurotrade
Centre, resumed construction. In November, Wiggins' auditors signed an
unqualified report. The suspension of the shares, which took place on March
16, was lifted on December 11. 'Your group, although bruised, lives to fight
another day,' Hayklan told Wiggins' shareholders in its annual report.

D J Freeman &amp; Co, the firm of City solicitors which advised Wiggins, has
itself fallen victim to the the property market recession.
For the second time since September, the firm, which is one of the top ten
commercial property specialists, announced earlier this month that the
current economic climate had forced it to make staff cuts. This time, two
salaried partners and up to six equity partners, together with six assistant
solicitors will be leaving.
Although D J Freeman appears to have been particularly badly affected by the
property slump, other commercial law firms have not escaped either. Three
other large City law firms, Richards Butler, McKenna &amp; Co, and Titmus Sainer
&amp; Webb have all laid off property lawyers in the past six months. Other
firms equally affected have taken the decision to carry excess capacity.
David Solomon, D J Freeman's chief executive, hopes the latest redundancies
will be the last. There are signs, he says, that the property downturn may
be plateauing with a number of foreign investors, particularly from Sweden,
Japan and the US, beginning to show interest in the UK market again.
But on the surface D J Freeman appears to be guilty of adopting a rigid
approach to its current problems. Income from property work is down so
cutting costs by making property lawyers redundant is the answer; cut costs,
profits up.
In the legal profession, however, such a short-term approach - particularly
reducing the numbers of assistant solicitors - can be dangerous. The work of
redundant senior assistants will have to be taken over by someone else,
probably a partner, but may not support a partner's hourly rate.
A 'succession gap' may open up as a consequence of removing people who would
have formed the next generation of partners and when things pick up again
good assistants may be hard to find. The firm may be tempted to promote
people into partnership too early or may spend a period 'under-partnered'.
All these factors can hold back growth and development.
A better approach is to weed out those solicitors who have already been
promoted beyond their level of capability and those who, though competent at
their present level, show no ability to rise to the next irrespective of the
department they work in. An attempt should also be made to persuade good
lawyers to be flexible about where they work. In other words, just because
property work is down does not necessarily mean that property lawyers should
be made redundant.
Solomon denies that D J Freeman has been guilty of such short-term thinking.
Some hard decisions had to be taken and the firm has lost some good people,
he says. But every attempt was made to persuade good lawyers to move
sideways. Three property lawyers have moved into the litigation department.
Others were offered a move to other departments but wanted to stay in
property work and some were 'not suitable' for transfer, he says.
McKenna and Richards Butler both attempted to find other work for their
under-employed property lawyers. McKenna set out to lose 13 jobs in its
property department. In the end only one para-legal was re-allocated
elsewhere in the firm. Four of the 13 were interviewed for jobs in other
departments and an offer was made to one assistant solicitor who in the end
took a job as a property lawyer with another firm.
According to Stephen Whybrow, the firm's managing partner, there will be no
more lay-offs at McKenna. 'We took the view last summer that if the market
continued to dip we were going to have too many people but if we were going
to make people redundant we would do the whole thing in one go.' That
strategy appears to have worked; the property department is now on budget.
Not all commercial property lawyers share the same pessimistic view of the
market. Earlier this month the property partners of City solicitors Birkbeck
Montagu announced that they were splitting away from the firm to form their
own boutique commercial property practice.
This looks like a brave move, but the new firm - Stepien, Lake, Gilbert &amp;
Paling - is not a start-up in the true sense of the word. It has inherited
all Birkbeck Montagu's property clients and although its property work has
declined by about 15 per cent over the past 18 months this nevertheless
gives the new practice a solid base on which to build.
The decision to split the firm was taken last September. It arose from a
difference of opinion on a strategy for growth. The property lawyers felt
the firm should build a corporate practice on the back of a strong
commercial property practice. The corporate/ commercial lawyers felt the
best way to become a corporate-led City law firm was to become bigger.
'We didn't see how Birkbeck Montagu could become bigger short of merger,'
says Tim Lake. (This is the 1990s and law firms mergers are 'out'.)
'Our philosophy was that we should concentrate on the areas where the firm
had expertise, which was in commercial property and where the firm's big
clients were, and build on that,' he adds.
Can a small specialist commercial property firm survive in the current
climate? Kaz Stepien, the senior partner, says smaller firms have more room
to manoeuvre than the larger ones during a recession and have much greater
scope for reducing overheads. Time will tell.

FT  17 APR 91 / Business and the Environment: Industry on the warpath to
fight greenhouse battle - John Hunt on efforts to sustain economic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT

<TEXT>
The international business community is beginning to get its act together in
preparation for the world environment and development conference in Rio de
Janeiro next year - an event dubbed the Earth Summit. Governments will meet
there to draw up an international convention to combat global warming.
In Rotterdam last week 700 heads of companies and business organisations,
including many corporate giants, met at the second world industry conference
on environmental management to set their own agenda for ensuring that their
voice is heard at Rio. Many people in business and industry fear that the
Rio meeting could move in the direction of tighter government pollution
regulations that would inhibit economic growth and international trade.
Business leaders argue that - contrary to the zero growth doctrines of some
environmentalists - strong economic growth is the only way of providing the
funds necessary to improve the environment in the industrialised world and
provide aid for a cleaner performance in eastern Europe and the developing
countries.
At the conference, organised by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC),
business and industry mulled over these problems for three days. Out of it
came a business charter for sustainable development - the buzzword for
economic growth which refrains from inflicting lasting damage on the
environment. The charter commits the 200 signatories to environmentally
sound operations and to give the highest priority to environmental
management.
They promise to improve environmental performance and assess the
environmental impacts of any new operation, to conduct regular 'green'
audits and to modify products and activities so they prevent environmental
damage.
Environmental campaigners were not overly-impressed by these good
intentions. The code is voluntary and relies on peer pressure among
industrialists for its observance. Nevertheless the ICC is undertaking to
discuss with the United Nations Environment Organisation the possibility of
establishing a method of monitoring members' performance.
The positive mood of the conference could not have existed a few years ago.
This was summed up by Robert Kennedy, chairman and chief executive of Union
Carbide, who had to deal with the aftermath of the disaster at his company's
plant in Bhopal, India in 1984.
At one time, he said, industry had automatically stonewalled when things
went wrong. In the face of public outrage at such events, however, more
information has been forthcoming. Now a dialogue had developed between
business and public. 'We ignore public fear and outrage at our peril,' he
warned.
There was also a consensus that the costs of improving environmental
performance should be fully incorporated into the pricing system and passed
on to the customer. The previously-held view that air, land and water were
free resources has led to much environmental degradation.
It was suggested that the cost of the big clean-up could put a squeeze on
profits. The use of 'market instruments' to encourage better performance
through the workings of the free-market rather than by tougher regulations
was given strong backing.
Tradeable permits were advocated as one such method. Under this system a
company with lower pollution can sell its surplus permits to one with higher
pollution. Thus the highest polluter pays the most and the principles of the
free market are satisfied.
The development of the free market was seen as a prerequisite for
environmental improvement. 'Industry considers environmental protection as a
pre-condition for growth rather than a limit to growth,' declared Heinrich
Weiss, president of the Federation of German Industries.
There was a cool reception for the notion of a carbon tax on fossil fuels
such as coal, oil and natural gas - which produce much of the carbon dioxide
that contributes to global warming.
Torvild Aakvaag, vice president of Norsk Hydro and chairman of the ICC
Environment Commission, said: 'It would have to be harmonised
internationally to be efficient and I don't think it is possible. It is
inconceivable that China, which consumes 1bn tonnes of coal a year, would be
willing or able to introduce such a tax.'
Nevertheless, a main theme of the conference was the need for business to
improve energy conservation and for governments to encourage it.
Renewable sources of energy, such as wind and hydro power, should be
encouraged but there was a strong feeling that fossil fuels will be the main
form of energy for some decades.
Nuclear energy also found strong advocates. 'I don't think we can allow
ourselves to disregard that option,' said Aakvaag. 'I am convinced that
nuclear energy will make a come-back.'
Laurens Brinkhorst, director general for environment at the EC Commission,
encapsulated the environmental problem facing world business. 'Will industry
have the courage and determination to take environmental measures in its own
hands thereby maintaining its flexibility and competitiveness? Or will the
policy makers be forced to take the difficult decisions needed to protect
the environment?'
The answer will become clearer as the Rio conference draws near.

FT  17 APR 91 / Business and the Environment: Tarnish forms on the green
image - Manufacturers which claim that their products will not harm the
environment cannot always back this up. Peter Knight looks at the market for
green products and considers why consumers have lost some of their initial
enthusiasm

The advertising man said he was going to beef up the campaign with 'the
ozone thing'. The client stared in disbelief. The use of spurious
environmental claims in simplistic sales campaigns was soundly discredited
last year.
Rover, for example, promised that its Metro would not harm the ozone layer
because it used lead-free petrol. Saab claimed its catalytic converters
removed 'ozone-punching hydrocarbons'. Both claims were scientifically
unsound. Britain's Advertising Standards Authority upheld complaints against
these and other companies, including Ecover, a maker of washing powders.
Friends of the Earth started The Green Con award especially for the creators
of such outrageous and misinformed claims. The public, already confused by
the complexity of the 'environment thing', grew wary and cooled their brief
love affair with so-called environment friendly consumer products. These now
get far less shelf-space in supermarkets than a year ago.
The success of a new brand of detergent, Radion, which offered no
environmental guarantees but promised to remove body odour from clothes, was
partly attributed to the ineffectual 'green' washing powders. It also
highlighted the difficulty in communicating complex scientific issues as
opposed to simple messages about smells and stains. The debate about the
alleged effects of zeolites, phosphates and optical whiteners on the
environment did not stand a chance against the promise to eradicate body
odours.
'Too many manufacturers thought that a little green slant was all that was
needed. But the market moved on too quickly for that,' says Dorothy
McKenzie, of Dragon International, a new Anglo-French marketing consultancy.
Although the Green Cons and the ozone-punchers got most of the publicity,
there were more intelligent and effective marketing campaigns which used
people's interest in the environment to stimulate sales.
Varta, for example, marketed its mercury-free, and later cadmium-free,
batteries in this way. This German-based dry-cell battery maker holds third
place with around 9 per cent of the UK market for alkaline batteries and 7
per cent of zinc-based batteries, according to market researchers Mintel. It
is a long way behind the market leaders, Ever Ready and Duracell.
For most of 1988 Varta sold zinc-chloride batteries which contained roughly
the same amount of mercury as in competitive products. Its mercury-free
'green' batteries were on sale in some Continental countries which were more
environment-conscious than the UK at the time.
Varta saw an opportunity to improve market share and to differentiate itself
from the main suppliers in the UK. It imported the 'green' batteries and
sold them as such, eventually wrapping them in what was considered
appropriate packaging (no plastic, recycled card) and promoting them heavily
as batteries that 'don't cost the earth'.
The campaign worked well but consumers were either unaware or did not care
that throw-away batteries are inherently unfriendly to the environment.
Their manufacture consumes more than 50 times the energy eventually
delivered and they introduce hazardous chemicals into the environment when
discarded.
Varta prospered initially, however, by providing a product that the
competitors did not offer. This achieved one of the company's aims - to get
shelf-space in supermarkets. But the competition soon caught up and most
throw-away chloride batteries are now free from heavy metals, or only
contain traces. But this change was brought about by impending EC
legislation and a battery manufacturers' agreement on heavy metals.
Varta, aware that the markets have moved on rather swiftly, now concentrates
on the rechargeable sector, which it sees as the next growth area. It offers
to recycle its spent rechargeable batteries (which contain heavy metals) and
gives a 50p voucher to customers who post their spent rechargeable batteries
to the company.
But the inadequacy - and sometimes rank stupidity - of some green
promotional campaigns have overshadowed the fundamental shift that some
observers detect in the consumer market. Green issues, it seems, will remain
important because they are being joined by a set of complex social issues
that are starting to influence consumer markets.
'Companies now have to regard issues like environmental performance,
corporate standards of behaviour, trading policies and community involvement
as a crucial aspect of business marketing,' says McKenzie.
Some firms have taken this on board. Esprit, the US-based clothes retailer,
promotes 'responsible consumption'. This idea is similar to that promoted so
assiduously by the Body Shop. Its message is: buy only environmentally sound
goods and buy fewer.
By promoting reduced consumption (but not at their shops) and their
particular version of corporate morality, companies such as Esprit and the
Body Shop are trying to sell a vision of how businesses should behave in a
threatened world. This, they argue, corresponds with the shift in consumer
attitudes brought on by the environmental threat to the planet.
Skeptics view this 'vision thing' as opportunistic because it merely
provides a version of the 'unique selling point' (USP). But, say others, it
should be seen as an example of how companies are being forced by a changing
market to merge their brand and corporate marketing.
These have been traditionally kept apart. Corporate affairs departments have
been charged with massaging the company's image with soft sells, such as
donations and sponsorships. The marketing departments have been responsible
for selling the coarser benefits of the brand, such as the power to get rid
of those horrible odours.
But with USPs becoming more difficult to achieve, a supplier's corporate
image is playing a bigger role in helping the consumer to choose between
products that are largely identical - from computers and cars to hairspray.
This goes some way to explaining why some companies outside the general
consumer markets are dedicating considerable resources to greening their
organisations worldwide.
For example IBM, the computer and information services provider, is spending
heavily on environmental improvements, from eradicating CFCs from its
manufacturing plants to recycling plastic cups in its canteens.
The 'ozone thing' might not have a direct effect on computer sales, but
achieving environmental excellence is essential to bolster corporate image.
And the marketing of that image plays a vital role in maintaining its
leadership in world markets where the stability and acceptability of the
corporation is becoming more important than its purely technical
achievements.
IBM is not alone in this. Companies such as 3M and Shell have long seen
environmental excellence as part of their pursuit of quality. Success in
both areas bolster their corporate image.
Few multinationals are now without some form of written environmental
policy, although the majority are still struggling with the complexity of
reaching their aims. It will be some time before they can include their
achievements in their marketing campaigns.
Getting rid of those ghastly body odours from daddy's shirt will not be
enough to win market share. But, it seems, neither will just being green.
Previous articles in the series examined environmental audits, product
design and manufacturing.

FT  17 APR 91 / FT Law Report: 'Defectively designed' implies negligence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HITCHINS (HATFIELD) LTD v THE PRUDENTIAL ASSURANCE CO LTD
Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Parker, Lord Justice Butler Sloss and Lord
Justice Mann): March 27 1991
INSURERS WHO cover building contractors for loss arising out of 'defect in
design' subject to a proviso excluding the redesigning costs of 'defectively
designed' property cannot raise a defence of defective design to a claim for
redesigning costs without proving negligence or the contractors' personal
failure, in that 'defectively designed' is not merely descriptive of the
inanimate property, but indicates personal activity on the designer's part.
The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by the plaintiff
insured, Hitchins (Hatfield) Ltd, from Mr Justice Evan's decision on a
preliminary issue on its claim against the defendant insurer, the Prudential
Assurance Co Ltd.
LORD JUSTICE PARKER said that Hitchins were building contractors. During
September 1984 they were working on the development of a residential housing
site at Filsham Valley, St Leonards on Sea.
The development was on a nine-degree slope. To build the houses Hitchins
terraced the site to provide four level benches. That involved increasing
the slope between the terraces to about 22 degrees.
After some of the houses had been built there was a series of landslips due
to the presence of discrete shear surfaces within the clay.
The houses were not damaged but the slopes between the terraces had to be
reinstated.
Hitchins were insured by the Prudential under a Contractors' Combined Policy
covering February 1 1984 to June 30 1985.
By section 1 of the policy they were covered for all risks to the works and
the property.
By clause 3 of an endorsement to section 1, the insurance covered loss
arising out of 'any fault, defect, error or omission in design' subject to
provisos: '(i) the property insured . . . shall not be deemed damaged solely
by virtue of any such fault, defect, error or omission . . . (iv) no amount
shall be admitted in respect of any increased costs due to re-designing the
property insured or any part thereof which is defectively designed'.
Hitchins claimed Pounds 860,306 under the policy for the cost of reinstating
the works, including the costs of shoring up and propping by piling.
By writ dated March 2 1988 it was alleged that although the Prudential had
paid Pounds 304,877 under the policy it had wrongfully refused to pay the
remainder.
In paragraph 5 of its points of defence the Prudential alleged that the land
slip occurred due to design defects in the works.
It said that the slope as constructed was unstable, and that proper design
required the installation of piling and drainage to stabilise the slope.
In paragraph 7 the Prudential alleged that installation of piling and
drainage was necessary to rectify the original defective design and it was
not liable for such costs and expenses.
A preliminary issue was tried as to whether on the true construction of the
policy (a) the facts alleged in paragraphs 5 and 7 were capable of
constituting a good defence in law to Hitchins's claim; and (b) if so,
whether the Prudential must further prove that the design of the works was
negligent or arrived at with some element of personal failure or
non-compliance by Hitchins.
Mr Justice Evans answered (a) yes and (b) no. Hitchins now appealed.
The question was whether it was necessary, in order to be able to justify
refusal to admit any increased costs due to redesigning, to prove that the
original defect in design was negligent or arrived at with some element of
personal failure or non-compliance by Hitchins.
Clause 3 of section 1 specifically included loss arising out of any fault,
defect, error or omission in design subject to the provisos.
It was common ground that, subject to the provisos, that wording was apt to
cover loss due to faults, defect, errors or omissions, whether or not they
were negligent or involved an element of personal blame for non-compliance.
Proviso (i) contained a form of definition by limiting the meaning of damage
so as not to include loss due solely to the existence of 'any such fault,
defect' etc.
There was a clear reference back to the general words, 'loss . . . arising
out of any fault, defect . . . in design', and there was thus no question of
distinguishing between negligent and non-negligent errors or omissions.
Proviso (iv) was markedly different in content from proviso (i). Unlike
proviso (i) it did not on its face refer back to the general words, it was
clearly an exception rather than a definition; it dealt with increased costs
due to redesigning; it did not refer to fault, error or omission; it did not
use 'defect in design', but 'defectively designed'.
Hitchins contended that the change in wording was significant, that 'defect
in design' covered any defect which in fact existed in the design whether or
not the defect was due to negligence, but that use of the adverb
'defectively' to qualify the verb 'designed' connoted a measure of blame on
the part of the designer.
Hitchins relied on Mr Justice Windeyer's judgment in the High Court of
Australia in Queensland Government Railways and Electric Power Transmission
v Manufacturers Mutual Insurance (1969) 1 Lloyd's Rep 215.
In that case the plaintiffs claimed under a construction all risks policy
which provided that the insurance should not include loss or damage arising
from 'faulty design'. The difference between 'faulty design' and 'faulty
designing' was considered at length in Windeyer J's judgment.
He said the court was concerned with 'faulty' not as importing blame, but as
descriptive of an inanimate thing. He said in that sense 'fault' and
'faulty' did not connote a falling short in conduct, but designated an
objective quality of a thing - 'It is faulty because it has defects, flaws
or deficiencies.' He said faulty workmanship was a reference to the manner
in which something was done, to fault on the part of a workman, but a faulty
design on the other hand, was a reference to a thing.
Proviso (iv) was directed to costs due to redesigning what had been
defectively designed.
'Redesigning' appeared to point to personal activity or conduct, and there
was no reason to hold that the following words, 'defectively designed',
should be construed differently.
Both 'designing' and 'designed' were part of a verb referring to the
designer's activity rather than the inanimate product of his work.
In his judgment Mr Justice Evans said that the question was whether the
draftsman had used the words 'which is defectively designed' as a form of
reference back to the words of cover which appeared to be 'defect in
design'. Or had he intended not merely to refer back to the cover but to
introduce the further qualification that the proviso was only to apply when
there had been negligence in the design with the resulting defect in design.
The judge had no doubt that 'defectively designed' was intended as a
reference back and that the intention was that the insurers should not be
liable for increased costs due to 'defect in design', which was covered by
the words 'which is defectively designed'.
He held he was not compelled by the Australian judgments to draw the
distinction to which they pointed.
There was no basis for concluding that the words were intended as a
reference back to the opening words.
The differences between the wording of proviso (iv) on the one hand and
proviso (i) and the general words on the other, were too great to justify
any such conclusion.
No tenable explanation of such differences was advanced. Nor was it
demonstrated that unless so construed the commercial purpose of the
insurance would be defeated.
There was no reason in the light of the changed wording of proviso (iv),
which referred to the activity of design, to conclude that the intention was
to exclude any increased costs due to redesigning even when the original
fault in design was not negligent. There was at least some reason to
conclude that the insurers' intention was to exclude such costs where the
original fault in design was negligent.
On the basis of the wording used, the judge erred. The appeal should be
allowed.
Lord Justice Butler Sloss and Lord Justice Mann agreed.
For Hitchins: Giles Wingate-Saul QC and Digby Jess (Peter Rickson &amp;
Partners).
For the insurers: Richard Aikens QC and Jonathan Hirst QC (Clyde &amp; Co).

FT  17 APR 91 / Isle of Man Budget aims to help business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISLE of Man government yesterday presented to Tynwald, the island's
parliament, a budget designed to spread the benefits from the island's
thriving economy among less well-off residents and increase aid for business
ahead of the island's autumn general election.
The Isle of Man, a crown dependency, has its own parliament and manages its
own financial arrangements, including setting its level of taxation.
The Manx government will give an initial allowance of 100 per cent on new
capital expenditure for industrial, tourist and agricultural buildings. Manx
government grants towards such expenditure will no longer be taken into
account when determining the allowance.
Mr Donald Gelling, the Manx treasury minister, said his intention was to
assist business, while 'seeking to ensure adequate funding for the provision
of enhanced public services and for assistance to the less well-off'.
Mr Gelling had Pounds 355m to distribute - Pounds 47m more than last year -
of which Pounds 49m is intended for capital expenditure. He decided against
a transfer from revenue to the reserve fund, which stands at Pounds 61.5m
and will benefit from Pounds 4.75m in interest earned and the sale of Manx
banknotes and coins.
The island retains its two-tier tax system, with personal income tax for
residents at 15 per cent for the first Pounds 8,000 of taxable income and 20
per cent on the balance. Non-residents and companies will continue to pay
income tax at 20 per cent on their whole taxable income.
Personal allowances will increase from Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 5,650 for a
single person and from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 11,300 for a married couple,
fully transferable between husband and wife. Single parents' allowances rise
from Pounds 3,440 to Pounds 3,900 and a registered blind person's allowance
increases Pounds 200 to Pounds 1,450.
Prescription charges stay at Pounds 1 an item and tax relief will be
introduced on premiums on private medical insurance for those aged 60 and
over.
The increase in VAT in the UK Budget gave Mr Gelling an unexpected
additional Pounds 2.65m, which is to be distributed to the island's
residents through rebates on water and electricity charges. An average
household in the island can expect a rebate of Pounds 32 a year on water and
Pounds 34 on electricity.

FT  17 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Beith admits middle incomes would
be hit - Local income tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democrats' proposals for a local income tax would mean higher
bills for households with an income of more than Pounds 20,000, according to
figures put out by the party yesterday.
Introducing the party's plans, Mr Alan Beith, the party's Treasury
spokesman, acknowledged that if it had to increase the amount being raised
from the poll tax this year, middle- and higher-income households, including
many with two earners both on relatively modest wages, would pay more.
'What people hated most about the poll tax was that it was not related to
ability to pay,' he said.
'Any reform of the poll tax system will lead to people generally on higher
incomes paying more - we can't duck that.'
On average, a Pounds 40,000-income household would pay just over Pounds
1,150 a year, compared with an average poll tax for two people of Pounds
504. Households with incomes below Pounds 5,000 would pay nothing.
The range of tax rates in local areas goes from 1.8 per cent in Rochester to
5.2 per cent in Haringey.
The party's calculations are based on an average rate of 3.3p in the pound,
which Mr Beith defended against the estimate from Mr David Mellor, the chief
secretary to the Treasury, that an average rate of 'around four pence' would
be needed.
The tax would be deducted at a single rate, and adjusted at the end of each
year. Where local authorities had spent above that rate, their residents
would have to pay a further bill; where they had spent below it, residents
would receive a refund.
This national rate for levying the tax would be set high enough to entitle
some 70-80 per cent of people to refunds.

Labour MPs were last night pursuing Mr John Major, the prime minister, about
his residential connections with Lambeth - the London borough where he made
his political debut as a Conservative councillor.
In a cryptic response to a question in the Commons Mr Major explained that
at the relevant time he had lived 'directly opposite' 14 Templar Street, the
address said to have been attributed to him in the electoral register for
the period.
He said that by living opposite 14 Templar Street he had 'fully met' the
qualification required by those seeking to become a local councillor. Just
over 70 district health authorities replied to the survey carried out last
month.

FT  17 APR 91 / SIB proposes fresh rules on client funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXTENSIVE changes to rules covering how investment firms handle clients'
money were proposed yesterday by the Securities and Investments Board, the
chief investment regulator.
The board did not suggest significant changes of principle in spite of
concern expressed after the collapse of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, the
financial services group that went into administration last year.
The proposed changes were prompted by the experience of operating the
existing rules during the past three years and by difficulties that arose
when investment firms collapsed, SIB said. The changes, on which comments
should be made by June 28, include:
If clients of an investment firm specify a bank where they want their cash
to be held, the money will not be 'pooled' with that of other investors if
another bank used by the same investment firm collapses.
SIB decided not to change its rule on pooling in other cases. That rule,
under which all investors get back the same share of their investments if a
firm fails, is the fairest and most cost-effective way of handling such
cases, it said.
Investment firms will have to warn clients if at any time in the future they
might put money into a bank owned by the group to which the firm belongs.
That is a partial response to the B&amp;C case, where investment firms within
the group deposited money in a sister bank, British &amp; Commonwealth Merchant
Bank. Firms will have to notify professional investors if their money is not
held separately from the firms' own funds. That is a response to the failure
of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the US investment bank, where it emerged that
some professional investors had not realised that their funds were
intermingled with those of the firm rather than being held in segregated
accounts.
Many other changes are designed to simplify procedures for investment firms.
For example, firms will no longer have to pay interest to a client if they
invest the client's money within 10 days of receiving it.

FT  17 APR 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Jury told of breach of Stock Exchange
disclosure rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTY NATWEST Securities breached Stock Exchange rules by delaying in
reporting to it that it held more than 5 per cent of Blue Arrow, Mr David
McMullan, then finance director of CNWS, told the Blue Arrow trial
yesterday.
Mr McMullan, a prosecution witness, told the court that since CNWS held just
less than 5 per cent of the company, he checked daily to see that the level
requiring disclosure to the Stock Exchange was not reached in normal
trading.
When that happened, and CNWS's holding briefly exceeded 5 per cent, he
informed Mr Peter Dale, then managing director of CNWS. Mr Dale refused to
allow him to report the holding to the Stock Exchange within the statutory
five days, Mr McMullan told Mr Nicholas Purnell, QC, prosecuting.
'I kept telling him we were in breach of Stock Exchange rules - this really
can't go on.'
Mr Dale had told him there were other matters that were more important,
everything would fall into place, and the reporting would be done as soon as
possible, Mr McMullan said.
The report was made to the Stock Exchange more than two weeks after the 5
per cent limit was reached.
Later, when County NatWest announced that it had a 9.5 per cent holding in
Blue Arrow, he understood why Mr Dale had wanted to delay reporting the
matter.
Mr Dale told him he now knew the whole picture.
Mr McMullan also told the court that concern over a possible Stock Exchange
inquiry into CNWS's backlog in processing settlements led to alteration of
the accounting treatment of CNWS's largest holding of 31.5m shares being
considered.
Unlike other Blue Arrow shares held by CNWS, this stake, kept on a 'back,
back book', was not marked for market (adjusted to current market prices)
because of the unwritten indemnity against loss given to CNWS by its
co-subsidiary, County NatWest.
The holding would have had to be marked for market and that would have
involved using profits from an option hedge to compensate for losses
incurred, he said.
'This was the indemnity under a different disguise,' he said.
Mr McMullan said that on September 29, when first told CNWS was to take a
large holding, he was also told by Mr Philip Rimell, who was then CNWS
chairman, that Phillips &amp; Drew, the brokers to the issue, also had a
holding.
He left the meeting with the impression that it was of a similar size.
County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips and Drew Securities
and seven individuals deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the
outcome of the 1987 rights issue which funded Blue Arrow's take-over of
Manpower, the US employment group.
The trial continues today.

FT  17 APR 91 / World Trade News: Distortions in farm trade highlighted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DULLFORCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GATT'S REPORT on the EC spotlights how individual governments complicate the
Community's external agricultural policy by setting up farm support
programmes of their own and continue to insulate their domestic markets from
trade effects.
Taking Germany as an example, Gatt shows how the federal government had
succeeded in 'defusing reform efforts' by the EC Commission.
Germany has changed value added taxes and considerably expanded federal aid
to 'disadvantaged regions' which make up half its total agricultural area.
In 1988 federal aid amounted to DM445m (Pounds 148.30m) up from DM65m in
1983.
Gatt points out that the bulk of farm commodities produced and consumed in
the EC are decoupled from the world market through the system of variable
levies by which Brussels bridges the gap between high EC farm prices and
lower world market prices.
This leads to an odd situation from the point of view of the multilateral
trading system. The EC's major imports are coffee, soyabeans, oilcakes and
shellfish, to which variable levies do not apply, while Brussels pays export
subsidies, amounting to Ecu6bn (Pounds 4.14bn) in 1989, to find markets for
surplus EC output of cereals, milk products and beef.

FT  17 APR 91 / World Trade News: Poor marks for EC external trade practices
 -William Dullforce analyses Gatt's report on the European Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DULLFORCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GENERAL Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's review of the European
Community's trade policies, released yesterday, finds a striking
contradiction between the EC's internal and external behaviour.
Internally, the Community is eliminating discrimination. It is creating a
single market, in which the free movement of goods, services and capital
will be assured and internal barriers to trade will disappear.
Externally, in contrast, the Community has been pursuing highly
discriminating practices, according to the Gatt secretariat. It complains
that the EC has put in place a 'complex hierarchy' of preferential trading
arrangements and built up a network of bilateral agreements with other
countries, which introduce 'strong elements of discrimination' into the
multilateral trading system.
In the most outspoken report it has published since it started reviewing
national trade policies in 1989, Gatt also raises several questions about
the Community's institutional framework.
One concerns the transfer of national power to Brussels, specifically to the
EC Commission. Gatt points to the lack of a statutory independent body at
the Community level to act as a watchdog in trade matters, and it notes that
the European parliament plays only an advisory role in trade policy.
The system under which the Commission proposes and councils of 12 ministers
dispose favours 'sector-specific views' against overall economic or trade
considerations, when policies are formulated, the Gatt secretariat says.
Coal, steel, cars and semi-conductors are cited as examples of the EC's
penchant for pursuing individual industries' interests separately. But the
most glaring case has probably been in agriculture, where decisions by the
12 farm ministers effectively prevented the Uruguay Round international
trade liberalisation negotiations from ending on schedule last December.
The Round has demonstrated the difficulties EC member states experience in
coming to a common negotiating position and the inflexibility inherent in
its decision-making system once a common position has been agreed, Gatt
says.
Summing up its findings, Gatt considers that, as the world's largest
exporter and importer, it is time that the EC matched its internal
integration with 'a parallel lifting of its external barriers and closer
adherence to the fundamental principles underlying the multilateral trading
system'.
The Gatt report is by no means totally disparaging about EC external
policies. The Community is defended against the charge that its drive
towards a single, internal market is creating a 'fortress Europe'. Brussels
has not raised protectionist barriers overall in the last three years; its
trading partners are sharing in the stimulation given to internal economic
growth through the spillover into import demand.
Tariff barriers against imports are moderate at a trade-weighted average of
5.1 per cent and almost all industrial tariffs are 'bound' by an undertaking
not to increase them.
However, Gatt considers that the value of these tariff bindings has been
eroded by the EC's propensity to strike bilateral agreements 'targeted
against the most competitive foreign suppliers' among its trading partners.
EC textile and clothing manufacturers are shielded by 19 bilateral
agreements under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement and by 'self-restraint' deals
with exporters in Mediterranean countries.
Some 50 bilateral export restraint accords are in place. The most notorious
concern Japanese exports of cars, machinery, electrical and electronic
equipment to the EC but South Korea now appears to rank second with
agreements on frozen squid, footwear and video-tape recorders. The EC
Commission told the Gatt that it was 'not aware' of some of these measures.
Information about the parties involved, the trade covered, the degree of
restriction, the duration or regional application of these agreements within
the EC is limited, Gatt says. The accords reduced 'transparency' in the
multilateral trading system and they tended to become entrenched, indicating
that they were delaying rather than promoting structural adjustment in the
EC industries concerned.
Brussels rarely resorts to the safeguard action allowed under Gatt rules to
provide temporary respite for industries badly hit by foreign competition.
EC officials told the Gatt that they regarded selective restraint agreements
with major exporters as less contentious and more efficient.
To conform with Gatt, safeguard measures must be temporary, applied to all
exporters of the products concerned and restriction on imports in one sector
must be compensated by liberalisation in other areas. A German safeguard
measure pinpointed in the Gatt report restricts coal imports. Dating back to
1958, it holds the Gatt record for longevity.
Reproaching the EC for preferring 'pragmatic solutions', such as bilateral
restraint arrangements or anti-dumping measures, Gatt warns that continuing
with this approach would offer 'a major threat' to a multilateral trading
system founded on principles of non-discrimination, transparency and
undistorted competition. The report notes with approval that the EC
Commission has recently argued strongly against the selective approach.
Another target of Gatt criticism is what it describes as the Community's
multi-layer system of trade preferences towards other countries. The EC
accords preferences under free trade agreements with the six countries of
the European Free Trade Association and Israel; under association
arrangements with Turkey, Malta, Cyprus and 69 African, Caribbean and the
Pacific countries; and under co-operation agreements with eight
Mediterranean countries. Similar deals are under negotiation with east
European countries and members of the Arab organisation, the Gulf
Co-operation Council.
About 60 per cent of EC imports derive from countries participating in
preferential schemes but the Gatt secretariat claims that the benefits are
frequently only partial, show disparities in treatment and, again, raise the
question of discrimination.

FT  17 APR 91 / World Trade News: Brazil to abolish law on information
technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRASILIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian government is planning to allow foreign companies to produce
software in Brazil and to abolish the controversial 'law of similars' which
prohibits the import of information technology similar to products
manufactured by Brazil companies.
The decision was taken last Friday by the National Informatics Council
(Conin) which meets today to put the final touches on a new law intended to
end the market reserve for Brazilian products and open up this most
protected area of the country's economy.
If the new law is passed by the Brazilian Congress it will end a
long-running trade row with the US and will be welcomed by foreign companies
wanting to enter Brazil's market and which hope it will put an end to
widespread pirating.
However the law's passage through Congress is not expected to be easy as it
will spell the demise of many Brazilian computer companies.
Information technology products in Brazil generally cost three times the
price in the US and are widely thought to be a generation behind. Mr
Gregorio Diaz, president of the US company Microsoft in Brazil, says: 'There
is an incredible amount of repressed demand in this country and Brazil is
currently foregoing lots of opportunities.' He welcomed the Conin
recommendations but warned: 'Let us see how it will be implemented.'
As part of President Collor's commitment to liberalisation, his government
has already promised to end the market reserve for Brazilian information
technology by October 1992. The delay is intended to give national industry
time to become competitive. However with Brazil currently in recession
national computer companies have little resources for modernisation and were
furious last October when the government reduced the list of protected
products but did not free the components considered necessary for national
companies to modernise.
Consequently many companies are now seeking foreign partners. Since this was
allowed in October two Brazilian companies, SID and Elebra, have signed
joint ventures with IBM and Digital respectively. Both IBM and Digital have
long been operating in Brazil. With direct access in sight foreign companies
not already in Brazil feel they have little to gain from joint ventures.

FT  17 APR 91 / World Trade News: Brussels says Gatt criticism is unbalanced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DULLFORCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community dismissed suggestions that its trade policy is
dominated by restrictive measures as unbalanced.
Criticism in Gatt's review failed to recognise the basic openness of the EC
market and the contribution to the growth of world trade in recent years, Mr
Roderick Abbot, EC director for external trade relations, told the Gatt
council.
In a written report to Gatt, in which it listed the problems it faces with
the US, Japan and some leading developing countries, the Commission said the
EC was operating in a far from perfect world - which might explain some
unjustified barriers.
In some sectors, in which the EC had been criticised the most, there was
another story to tell, Mr Abbot said. The Community was the world's largest
importer of farm products and over half the imports entered duty-free.
Community imports of textiles and clothing had more than tripled since 1976.
About 85 per cent of steel imports entered with no other obstacle than
normal low or preferential zero tariffs. Even for cars the level of import
penetration was already relatively high.
The EC's fundamental objective was to support and strengthen the
multilateral trading system and Gatt, Mr Abbot said. But the multilateralism
defended by the Gatt secretariat was not antithetical to preferential,
regional and bilateral trading arrangements, all of which were allowed under
Gatt rules and complemented the multilateral system.
Trade preferences could be of value for certain products from an individual
country but did not in themselves alter the overall pattern of trade flows
in an open economy.
The EC gave greater preference to the African, Caribbean and Pacific
countries, but their share in EC imports from all developing countries had
fallen from 20 per cent in 1970 to 14 per cent in 1989.
Brussels used bilateral export restraint agreements because the safeguard
action permitted by Gatt against imports threatening domestic industries was
difficult to apply and of too short duration to be effective in
restructuring industries like textiles.
Changes to the Gatt safeguard rules foreshadowed in the Uruguay Round could
result in fewer bilateral agreements being struck.

FT  17 APR 91 / World Trade News: Anti-dumping policy under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DULLFORCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSY over the European Community's use of anti-dumping measures is
likely to be stimulated rather than stilled by Gatt's trade policy review.
Gatt notes that the EC ranks among the most intensive users of anti-dumping
measures worldwide and that EC officials consider its anti-dumping and
anti-subsidy law to be 'one of the most important instruments of its common
commercial policy'.
Dumping occurs when a manufacturer sells a product on an export market at a
lower price than that charged on his home market. If dumping can be proved,
Gatt rules allow the importing country to impose duties on the product, to
protect its own manufacturers.
Other countries, in particular Japan and Asian exporters such as Hong Kong
and South Korea, have charged Brussels with using the anti-dumping
instrument arbitrarily. EC 'screwdriver plant' legislation applying
anti-dumping action to products assembled within the Community from imported
parts, has already been sanctioned by a Gatt disputes panel.
Between 1980 and 1989 the EC implemented 256 anti-dumping measures, the most
conspicuous being those taken against imports of Japanese electronic
equipment. In roughly two cases out of three the exporter undertook to raise
his price rather than have a duty imposed.
Brussels' claim that no more than about 1 per cent of total EC imports has
been subjected to anti-dumping charges excludes these price undertakings.
Moreover, Gatt argues that the uncertainty generated by the EC's frequent
resort to anti-dumping action is likely to affect a larger volume of trade.
It cites evidence that countries have voluntarily restrained exports to the
EC.
Gatt highlights an arrangement reached by the EC Commission in February
under which seven Japanese producers of advanced Eprom semi-conductors
agreed to price undertakings and the Commission threatened to impose a 94
per cent duty on any newcomer not prepared to give a price undertaking.
A public interest clause in EC law has apparently had no major impact on
Brussels' anti-dumping practices, Gatt says. It notes that only two of the
40 anti-dumping investigations launched between mid-1987 and mid-1988 were
terminated within the 12 months stipulated by EC Council regulations.
The EC Commission argues that its anti-dumping practice is fair, equitable
and in many instances more liberal than that of other countries.
The size and accessibility of the EC market made it a prime target for
dumping and it was essential for EC producers to benefit from an effective
instrument against unfair pricing, the Commission said.

FT  17 APR 91 / Gandhi unveils radical election manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rajiv Gandhi, India's Congress party leader, yesterday launched his
party's election manifesto with a pledge to cut government spending by 10
per cent in a first year of office and to embark on a privatisation
programme.
A Congress government would allow public sector companies to sell stock to
the public. And to help mobilise private savings, it would allow the private
sector to establish mutual funds - an area now reserved to state owned
institutions and nationalised banks.
Congress would also throw open road construction to the private sector.
Later, the public sector would withdraw from areas such as manufacturing,
hotels, petrochemicals, refineries and electric power.
The emphasis on deregulation and liberalisation reflects the views of
younger economists and politicians close to Mr Gandhi who believe there is
no alternative to radical change. In setting out a timetable of reform - a
major feature of the manifesto - they believe a new government must act
rapidly if it is not to be ensnared by bureaucratic hurdles.
With inflation at more than 12 per cent and interest payments absorbing a
third of government revenues, the proposed 10 per cent reduction in
expenditure represents a substantial cut in real terms. Mr Gandhi said it
would be 'spread across the board' - subsidies, salaries and defence. The
manifesto adds that expenditure would be held at the same level in nominal
terms during the second and third year of a Congress government.
Though there must be doubts whether a new government will in practice
implement such severe cuts, the manifesto implies that Mr Gandhi accepts the
conditions that would go with a substantial IMF borrowing. The most
important of these would be a major cut in the budget deficit.
The manifesto on this score will help restore Mr Gandhi's credibility with
foreign governments and creditors at a time when India is seeking to avoid
defaulting on its foreign debt. Mr Gandhi has been blamed by diplomats for
the postponement of the March budget which precipitated the decline in
India's creditworthiness.
The belief that Congress would implement an IMF package and that a
Congress-led government will emerge from the elections has prompted a sharp
rise on the Bombay stock market this week. Congress party officials are
privately less sanguine, believing that no party will gain an overall
majority and that this will reduce the prospects for radical change.
The passages on the economy constitute only a small part of the manifesto
that Mr Gandhi launched yesterday. He answered questions straightforwardly
and confidently, and without the facetiousness he has previously shown.
The manifesto shows Congress anxious to win votes from the very poor and the
Moslems - two traditional sources of support. Mr Gandhi promised Moslems he
would prevent further mosques from being 'reclaimed' as Hindu temples. This
concession to Moslem sentiment would seem to pave the way for a compromise
with Hindus over the proposed new temple at Ayodhya.
In contrast to Mr Gandhi's known personal beliefs, the manifesto promises
support for job reservation for the poor and backward castes. But unlike Mr
V P Singh's National Front which has pledged up to to 59 per cent job
reservation in the central government for the poor and lower castes,
Congress refrains from giving percentages.

Iran said yesterday a border crossing with Iraq had been reopened a day
after Iraqi tanks and troops had sealed it and killed a number of Kurdish
refugees. IRNA, the official news agency, said the Tileh Kouh border, near
the Iranian town of Sar-e-Pol-e-Zahab, was reopened on Monday night and
about 100,000 Iraqi refugees were waiting to enter.
Iraqi troops backed by 15 tanks had opened fire on the refugees at Tileh
Kouh on Sunday night, killing a number of them and closing their escape
route, according to a Tehran Radio report on Monday.
Iran formally protested to Baghdad, saying an Iraqi brigade moved two miles
into Iran in violation of a UN-brokered ceasefire halting the two countries'
eight-year war in 1988.

<TEXT>
THE United Nations would be prepared to take responsibility for
co-ordinating a register of international arms sales, Mr Javier Perez de
Cuellar said yesterday.
Addressing the European Parliament, the UN secretary general said a register
would ensure transparency in the world arms trade and could help prevent a
build-up of weapons, as happened before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
The idea of a global arms register first emerged at last week's EC summit in
Luxembourg, at which European leaders discussed the aftermath of the Gulf

Mr Perez de Cuellar was last night due to meet Mr Jacques Poos, foreign

FT  17 APR 91 / Output figures give little hope for US recovery
</HEADLINE>

FURTHER falls in housing starts and industrial production yesterday appeared
to offer little prospect of an early US recovery from recession.
The Commerce Department said housing starts fell 9 per cent in March to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 901,000. But the fall was influenced by
weather fluctuations and may have been a reaction to a sharp increase in
starts in February.
Building permits - regarded as the best guide to future construction
activity - rose 2 1/2 per cent. The second consecutive monthly increase
suggests that January may have marked the low point of the housing cycle.
Industrial production fell 0.3 per cent last month. This was roughly in line
with Wall Street expectations and represented an easing of the rate of
decline after falls in factory output of 0.5 per cent and 0.9 per cent in
January and February respectively.
Officials said industrial production declined at an annual rate of just over
9 per cent in the first quarter as a whole. This compared with an annual
rate of decline of 7 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year.
The latest figures, which follow reports of a 0.8 per cent decline in retail
sales in March and weak car sales in early April, offer little comfort for
economists expecting a rapid economic rebound following victory in the Gulf
war. The consensus view, however, remains that the recession will bottom out
sometime during the summer.
The Federal Reserve appears to be adopting a 'wait and see' approach. Having
left short-term interest rates uncut last week, it may now wait until April
employment figures are available in early May before reassessing its
monetary stance.
In the first quarter, housing starts were 12 per cent lower than in the
final quarter of last year. But in spite of the dip last month, starts in
March were nearly 6 1/2 per cent above the low point reached in January.
The decline in industrial production last month was broadly based,
reflecting continued weakness in business equipment, construction supplies,
and durable materials. Capacity utilisation dropped 0.4 points to 78.7 per
cent, its lowest level since autumn 1986.
Total production in March was 3.3 per cent below its level of a year ago and
nearly 5 per cent below the peak hit last September.

FT  17 APR 91 / Mexican reserves rise to Dollars 10.3bn

<TEXT>
MEXICO'S foreign reserves reached Dollars 10.3bn (Pounds 5.7bn) at the end
of last year, Dollars 3.4bn more than in 1989, the central bank announced
yesterday in an upbeat annual report.
The foreign reserves figures are announced only three times a year, and are
a closely watched indicator of investor confidence in the peso. Last
November President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said foreign reserves stood at
Dollars 8.4bn.
The increase in reserves partly derives from Mexico's Dollars 3bn windfall
from higher oil prices last year, and from proceeds from the privatisation
of Telmex, the telephone monopoly. In the first three months of this year
the Bank of Mexico is believed to have added a further Dollars 3bn to its
reserves, which would bring the current total to more than Dollars 13bn.
The latest figures should reassure investors worried about Mexico's ability
to finance its growing current account deficit, which, according to the
annual report, stood at Dollars 5.2bn last year. Thanks in part to an
estimated Dollars 1.4bn in repatriated flight capital, Dollars 2.6bn in
direct foreign investment and a further Dollars 2bn in foreign portfolio
investment, Mexico ran a capital account surplus of Dollars 8.8bn last year.
However, the amount of direct foreign investment is well below government
predictions of inflows of Dollars 5bn a year.
The report argued that the current account deficit mainly reflected
increased private-sector investment, and would thus lead to an increase in
exports.
The annual report confirms the worrying growth in Mexico's money supply,
suggesting that the biggest risk remains overheating of the economy.
Mexico's narrow money supply grew in real terms (adjusting for 30 per cent
inflation) by 26.6 per cent.

BRAZIL'S first case of cholera since the outbreak of the epidemic in
neighbouring Peru has been confirmed, Christina Lamb writes from Braslia.
Speaking on breakfast television yesterday, Mr Luis Romero Farias, the
interim health minister, said that one case had been confirmed and eight
possible cases registered in the Amazon region near the borders with Peru
and Colombia.
The government has launched an emergency programme in the area costing
Cr1.5bn (Pounds 3.3m) but Mr Farias admitted: 'The spread of the disease is
impossible to stop.'
Officials fear that the cholera bacteria will be quickly carried by the many
rivers which traverse Brazil.
According to Ministry of Health projections, Brazil could see 3m cases this
year - around 2 per cent of the population.
The worst-affected areas would probably be Amazonas and Rio de Janeiro, with
its high population density.

FT  17 APR 91 / Last-minute talks to avert rail strike: US business likely
to be hit severely if stoppage goes ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE threat of a national rail strike which could wreak havoc with freight
traffic hung over corporate America yesterday as unions and carriers fought
to settle a three-year contract dispute.
Both sides warned that a stoppage was possible if agreement were not reached
on a new labour contract by midnight yesterday.
The United Transportation Union, largest of the 11 unions involved in the
contract talks, said it had already sent out strike notices to members. If
no progress were made they could be on strike from 7am today. It added,
however, that it was joining the talks, due to restart in Washington
yesterday, between labour and management and was still 'hopeful' that a
stoppage could be averted.
On the carriers' side, the Association of American Railroads was gloomier,
suggesting that a strike was 'very likely' if negotiations proved fruitless.
The dispute has been almost three years in the making, as the two sides
attempted to hammer out a new contract. Under US legislation, labour
agreements in the rail industry are initially kept in force while new
contract negotiations take place.
If no progress is made, the next step is for a presidential emergency board
to study the situation and recommend a settlement.
The board recommendation, delivered in mid-January, suggested wage increases
averaging between 3 and 4 per cent a year over the next three years, but
also called for the number of miles which train crews have to travel for a
normal day's pay to be steadily increased. It also suggested that labour
should shoulder some of the mounting health benefit expenses in the
industry.
The report was not greeted with enthusiasm by the union camp. Procedurally,
however, its publication started a 'cooling-off period', which was extended
because of the Gulf war. But by yesterday morning, with 12 hours to go
before the final expiry of the grace period, only three of the 11 unions
involved had reached tentative agreements with management.
There seems little doubt the effects of a national strike on business would
be dire. About a third of the total freight moved around the US goes by
rail, and the coal, car, chemicals, grain and steel industries are among the
heaviest users.
Much of this could not be shipped any other way, and there have been
suggestions that a reduction in coal operations could take place within
hours. Chrysler warned yesterday that a rail strike 'of any length could
result in massive closings' of its plants.
Some rail companies, such as Burlington Northern, have made clear that they
will not even attempt to operate if a national strike begins. The railroads
association says this policy could become widespread among its members.
National unemployment, it has been calculated, could surge by around half a
million as the result of a national stoppage.
However, the unions have not revealed their strike tactics, and more
selective action is at least an option. How the rail companies would respond
in these circumstances was not clear.
Equally, politicians might take the matter into their own hands - as they
have done in previous rail disputes.
Mr Samuel Skinner, transportation secretary, pointed out yesterday that
previous rail strikes had been swiftly ended by Congress and he hoped this
one could be resolved in as little as a day.
He said the administration was ready to work with Congress as quickly as
Congress wanted to move.

FT  17 APR 91 / Russian republic may win US food credit guarantees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush, under pressure to grant new food credit guarantees to
the Soviet Union, may try to target the sales to the Russian republic.
The president has received a personal request from Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev for Dollars 500m (Pounds 279.3m) in credit guarantees for
purchases of maize and other commodities. The Dollars 1bn in guarantees
granted so far this year has been virtually exhausted.
Although the administration has been careful not to undercut Mr Gorbachev,
the president last weekend, in a speech on the 'new world order', said he
would in future meet representatives of the Soviet republics. Targeting the
additional food credits to Russia would tie in with Mr Bush's evolving
Soviet policy.
Mr Robert Dole, Senate Republican leader, was influential in getting the
last grant of guarantees. However, he and other congressmen were outraged
when shortly after the credit package was announced, the Soviets launched a
crackdown in Lithuania and Latvia. They also complained that the grain was
not getting to the republics.
Now, Senator Dole is said to be considering a Russian option; the credit
could be granted through the central government but for the republic. He is
to meet a Russian delegation, including Mr Ivan Silayev, the prime minister,
this week. Also in the group will be Mr Oleg Klimov, chairman of
Exportkhleb, the Soviet grain buying agency.
Mr Kent Van Amberg, an official with the US Feed Grains Council, said the
decision on future guarantees would be a political one. But, he stressed, it
is the Russians who most want the food credits and who own most of the
resources which generate foreign currency.
In his appeal to Mr Bush, Mr Gorbachev directly addressed US concerns about
Soviet creditworthiness. He said the central government's purchasing
agencies were up to date on payments, and he promised they would continue to
make their payments on time.
The farm lobby badly wants new credit allocations. Sales are lagging behind
last year's. The Dollars 563m in guarantees for maize provided the financing
for the only maize the Soviets have bought this year.
The farm groups have meetings arranged next week with the White House and
the US Agriculture Department. They also will seek a renewal of Mr Bush's
six-month waiver of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which cleared the way for
export financing.
The amendment ties favourable trade treatment and credits to emigration
policy. Because the Soviets have yet to codify an emigration law, the waiver
will not become permanent.
The waiver also cleared the way for credits from the US Export-Import Bank.
Thus far, Eximbank has approved seven offers of credit.

<TEXT>
PEACE talks in Mexico City between the El Salvador government and FMLN
guerrillas have hit problems since the recent killing of a senior guerrilla
leader.
Mr Antonio Cardenal, known as Commander 'Jonas', was killed in El Salvador
last week with 12 other guerrillas, in an ambush by a commando unit of the
army's elite Atlacatl battalion, in what was considered a
guerrilla-controlled area.
The FMLN has angrily accused the government of killing 'Jonas' after he was
taken prisoner and of trying to wreck the peace talks. An FMLN communique
yesterday warned that guerrillas would launch similar attacks against army
chiefs. It warned that any attempts by the army to push the FMLN out of
territory it controls would be resisted.
'Jonas' was a member of the FMLN's political-diplomatic commission and was
directly involved in earlier rounds of peace talks. He was Nicaraguan by
birth, and a nephew of the Nicaraguan president Mrs Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro.
Several big issues are at stake in the negotiations, aimed at establishing a
ceasefire by April 30. The FMLN wants the government to recognise its de
facto control of some territory during a period of 'armed peace' which will
lead to an eventual disarmament of the FMLN.
It also wants steps on constitutional reforms and the creation of an
commission to oversee the purging from the armed forces of officers linked
to human rights abuses.

THE Soviet Union yesterday called for a change in lending quotas imposed by
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development so that its reforms
could be speeded up, writes Judy Dempsey, East Europe Correspondent, in
London. Mr Victor Geraschenko, head of Gosbank, the Soviet Union's central
bank, said greater assistance from the EBRD and other western financial
institutions would stem the disintegration of the Soviet Union. In
particular, Mr Geraschenko said he hoped for the early elimination of a
clause which states that the total volume of all credits and other services
received from the EBRD during the first three years should not exceed (the
Soviet Union's) paid in capital.

Dr Leonyd Ilyin, director of the Institute of Biophysics in Moscow and an

reports that the death toll in the Chernobyl disaster ran to hundreds or
thousands, rather than the 30 officially admitted, writes David Fishlock in
Paris. He assured a joint conference in Paris organised by the Nuclear
Energy Societies of the Soviet Union and France that there was no increase
in registered numbers of cancer cases and no increase in the cases of acute
leukaemia and other blood diseases. Some 145 people had suffered from acute
radiation sickness as a result of the nuclear accident five years ago this
month, while the death toll remained at 30, he said. The latest official
Soviet estimate of its cost is Rbs20bn-25bn.

French inflation slowed slightly last month, but economic growth is also
lagging, according to provisional figures, writes William Dawkins in Paris.
Consumer prices rose 0.1 per cent in March, giving an annualised rate of 3.2
per cent, down slightly from the previous month's 3.5 per cent, says the
state statistics body, Insee.
The improvement is greater than some economists were forecasting, though at
least half comes from a drop in domestic fuel prices. This continues the
gentle convergence of French inflation towards the German level.

MORE specialised vessels arrived yesterday off the Italian coast to help
with the fight against the oil pollution caused by the tanker disaster near
Genoa.
The ships, which include the 'Ragno II', an oil exploration vessel owned by
Italy's Saipem oil company, will enable experts to form a better impression
of how much crude is left aboard the sunken Cypriot-registered supertanker
'Haven' and how best to remove it.
Using remote-controlled cameras, experts will try to ascertain the wreck's
condition. Decisions will then be taken on steps to remove the remaining
oil. Surface efforts have so far recovered 6,000-7,000 tonnes of oil that
had leaked from the vessel, which sank on Sunday.
However, scientists estimated there could still be 100,000 tonnes of crude
oil left in the ship and said this was a clear threat. Light winds were
slowly blowing the oil south-west, towards France.

FT  17 APR 91 / EC trade practices provoke sharp attack from Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DULLFORCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's trade deals with exporting countries have come
under sharp criticism from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt), the organisation which sets the rules governing world trade.
Gatt's hardest strictures are aimed at arrangements negotiated by the EC
with countries such as Japan designed to limit exports to the community of
electronic equipment, cars, machinery and textiles.
These have introduced 'strong elements of discrimination' to the
multilateral trading system and tend to encourage cartel-like behaviour both
within the EC and abroad, the Gatt secretariat says.
In its first review of EC trade policy, Gatt is also critical of the
frequent use by Brussels of anti-dumping action against foreigners accused
of selling their products too cheaply on EC markets, as well as the
widespread subsidies which are paid to farmers and manufacturers.
EC farm subsidies and protection for textiles and clothing manufacturers
entail a substantial cost for consumers, particularly for those with low
incomes, the report points out.
Nevertheless, Gatt does not find that the EC is creating a 'Fortress Europe'
against the rest of the world by its thrust towards a single internal market
in 1993.
Widespread concern that the 12 member states would turn inward had 'not been
confirmed to date' and there was little evidence of any recent major
intensification of protectionism by the EC.
At the same time Gatt notes that a 'hard core of controversial issues'
remains to be settled in the internal market context. The report mentions
car imports and warns that Brussels' current proposals for
telecommunications could restrict trading opportunities for other countries.
France and Italy are singled out for unduly insulating their home markets.
In mid-1990, France maintained 71 quantitative restrictions on imports of
food products and other goods, including consumer electronics and
semi-conductors says the report. Italy applied 48 similar measures.
German domestic support for its coal mines is about four times higher than
the UK's, Gatt notes. France is taken to task for its reluctance to report
all the subsidies paid to its producers.
The EC Commission argues that the Gatt secretariat has failed to recognise
the basic openness of the Community market and has passed an unbalanced
judgement.
Mr Roderick Abbot, EC director for external trade relations, told the Gatt
council that a grouping representing one-fifth of world trade, had to be
considered one of the driving forces behind the high levels of global flows
realised in the 1980s.

STAD Rotterdam, the fifth largest Dutch insurance company, said 1990 net
profit was up 8.9 per cent at Fl 79.8m (Dollars 42m), matching the rate of
increase in turnover - Fl 2.32bn from Fl 2.13bn.
Like other Dutch insurers, Stad Rotterdam's results were held back because
it had to pay about Fl 55m for damages due to severe winter storms. This
cost Stad Rotterdam a net Fl 8m after allowing for reinsurance, catastrophe
coverage and provisions.
The company is to increase its 1990 dividend to Fl 1.65 from Fl 1.64 in
1989.
Net profit in non-life insurance rose 7.9 per cent to Fl 37.1m and on life
insurance by 9.1 per cent to Fl 31.7m. Home mortgage operations posted an
11.6 per cent net rise to Fl 11m.
Stad Rotterdam intends to set up a joint venture in banking services with
Bank Cantrade, an Amsterdam-based subsidiary of Union Bank of Switzerland.

Deutsche-Airbus, the German aerospace group, has ordered the largest metal
forming press of its kind from GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French power equipment
and engineering joint venture, writes Charles Leadbeater, Industrial Editor.
The Pounds 3m order is for a 1,500 tonne press, to form 12 metre by 3 metre
aluminium titanium alloy sheets used to make aircraft fuselages and wings.
The investment in the press, which will be manufactured at ACB, the
GEC-Alsthom subsidiary based at Nantes in France, is a signal of Deutsche
Airbus' growing determination to expand its activities.

FT  16 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Oil sector remains in favour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE oil majors were to the fore yesterday, still responding to the recent
spate of buy notes on the sector, the firmness of crude oil prices and
suggestions that buying in the past few sessions had uncovered a number of
stock shortages among marketmakers.
The heaviest turnover in the sector - 9.7m shares - was in BP, where the
shares ran up strongly to 359p before ending the day a net 6 higher at 355p.
Buying was on the strength of rumours that the UK oil group would be
inviting bids for some of its assets in the US. Last night, sources in the
energy industry said BP was seeking a buyer for Tex/Con Oil and Gas, a
Texas-based subsidiary which holds all its onshore natural gas interests in
the US, excluding Alaska. BP declined to comment.
Shell were aggressively bought, closing 12 firmer at 511p, after 513p, on
turnover of 7m, as strong UK buying outweighed yet more switching out of
Shell and into Royal Dutch. Both stocks responded to the positive
presentation given to analysts in London last week.
British Gas edged up 2 to 246p on 6.4m with the imminent board meeting
expected to be followed by Gas's response to Ofgas's new tariff formula.
Enterprise, hit recently by worries about Elf possibly placing its 25 per
cent stake in the market or Enterprise making a big rights issue, rallied to
close 9 higher at 560p.
Rank unsettled
Rank Organisation lost ground in edgy trading as the company began a series
of meetings with securities houses at which analysts are being asked to
submit current forecasts and recommendations as a basis for discussion.
Cautious noises yesterday from one broker, Panmure Gordon, reflected the
mood ahead of the briefings. The shares recovered somewhat as the first
meeting began although no analyst had reported back by the time the market
closed. There were suggestions that James Capel was in the first briefing.
Today's is with Smith New Court.
Trading volume was light as Rank added to Friday's decline of 17 with a
further fall of 27 at yesterday's lowest point. The final price was 725p, a
drop of 11 on the day as 604,000 shares changed hands.
The second rights issue in ten months by industrial materials group Morgan
Crucible was perceived by the market as being 'cynically opportunist.' After
raising Pounds 79m net last June, the group this time called for Pounds
96.1m and the news stunned the market. Higher annual profits of Pounds 60m,
against Pounds 54.5m, failed to compensate and the shares moved lower to
close 14 down at 256p.
Morgan Crucible said there was considerable scope for it to continue to grow
both by further acquisitions and organically, and analysts assumed the
former was the purpose of the new finance. Many had reservations about the
stock, however, and shaved profits estimates for the current year. The
immediate consensus figure is around Hoare Govett researcher Mr Richard
Rae's forecast of Pounds 69m.
American buying was said to be behind the good showing by Royal Bank of
Scotland, which settled 6 up at 195p on turnover of 2.1m. Abbey National
shares were 2 off at 284p ahead of the presentation, hosted by Daiwa, to
Japanese institutions in Tokyo.
Press suggestions that Guardian Royal Exchange could end up as a takeover
target for Sun Alliance, among others, drove the shares up 7 to 214p. One
buyer was said to have been responsible for for Prudential adding 6 at 248p.
Blue Circle Industries (BCI), due to report preliminary figures on Thursday,
remained dogged by rights issue stories, with some specialists mentioning a
possible one-for-five issue at 210p to raise some Pounds 200m. BCI fell 4 to
257p. Recovery prospects outweighed the dismal results from Turriff and left
the shares 14 higher at 82p.
Whessoe went to 1991 high of 194p before ending 5 up on balance at 189p,
benefiting from comment on its long-term appeal both to institutional and
smaller investors. The engineering group was said to have disposed of
troublesome operations, had cash in hand and was trading on a modest
prospective price/earnings multiple. Second-half trading seasonally produces
the larger contribution to profits, but researchers still look for higher
interim figures when Whessoe reports on May 22.
Sema, the software group, dropped sharply to close 24 to 349p, hit by
suggestions that Cap Gemini Sogeti, the French group, may be about to sell
its 27.4 per cent stake and possibly launch a bid for SD-Scicon.
Another big turnover in Racal Electronics, 5.7m, was accompanied by vague
stories that the group could be about to sell a large stake in Racal Telecom
direct to Hutchison Whampoa, the Hongkong conglomerate. Racal intends
demerging its 80 per cent subsidiary Racal Telecom later this year.
Electronics closed 3 up at 233p as did Telecom, at 381p.
Buyers wanted British Vita ahead of tomorrow's annual meeting and the close
was 9 higher at 249p. Powerscreen registered good turnover as 1.3m shares
were placed but the price remained at 176p. Gartmore Investment Management
announced later yesterday a holding of 5.1 per cent.
French Connection rose 12 to 47p after it announced a return to
profitability of Pounds 57,000, against a loss the previous year of Pounds
4.67m.
Asda slipped 2 to 133p as Hoare Govett remained cautious on the food
retailer. Profits of Pounds 200m are expected this year, while in 1992/93
Hoare forecasts Pounds 189m, a new estimate. Asda's slower expansion
programme, greater competitive pressures and an inability to generate
sufficient cash flow will depress profitability, said Hoare.
Iceland Frozen Foods climbed 3 to 348p after Kleinwort Benson raised its
profits estimate.
Albert Fisher added 3 to 121p on optimism ahead of its finals on Thursday.
Analysts forecast profits of Pounds 44m against Pounds 30.5m last time.
Le Creuset, the French manufacturer of designer cast-iron cookware which
joined the USM two ago, attracted support ahead of tomorrow's annual
results. Analysts expect profits to exceed Pounds 3m, compared with Pounds
2.67m last time, and the shares closed 9 up at 183p.
Fellow USM stock Porth almost doubled to 11p on hopes that reports were true
of Sir Michael Edwardes, the former head of British Leyland, joining as
chairman. The company is the UK's largest manufacturer of Christmas
decorations.
The mood among leisure sector traders was cautious as many expected a rights
issue from Granada. Some were even prepared to name numbers and plumped for
a 2 for 5 issue at 160p today. The share eased a penny to 195p.
Allied Leisure, which runs bowling alleys, eased 5 to 104p on news of a one
for one rights issue at 97p to raise Pounds 16.1m. Smith New Court, the
company's broker, said that gearing had been approaching 150 per cent and
that after the issue it would be 40 per cent.
Tour operator Airtours climbed 13 to 357p after proposing a placing and
offer to raise Pounds 15.9m. The stock's strength was helped by the
accompanying statement that bookings at Airtours were three times the level
of last year's average. The placement with institutional investors is at
320p, the same price at which existing shareholders can apply on a three for
10 basis.
Volatile Brent Walker rose 8 to 71p on confirmation of the transfer of
assets, including the Trocadero retail, leisure and office development in
central London, to Power Corp.
Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC) was squeezed higher yet again as the
market prepared for details due this week of the proposed flotation of
Mirror Group newspapers. Both companies are controlled by Mr Robert Maxwell.
US securities house Goldman Sachs was again persistently bidding for MCC
shares, which climbed 14 to 239p.

FT  16 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities falter after early
show of strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A signal from the Federal Reserve that interest rates are to remain
unchanged for the time being and a mixed bag of first quarter company
results left share prices looking for direction yesterday, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 12.38 at 2,933.17, but
it had already moved from strength to weakness several times before then.
The broader-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also slightly firmer, ending up
0.97 at 381.37. The Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, however,
ended down 0.78 at 500.84, unsettled by a big fall in Apple Computer shares.
After a bright start trading tailed off. By the close turnover on the New
York SE reached only 162m shares. Advances outpaced declines by 923 to 670.
Equities opened higher on hopes that the Fed would cut interest rates after
last week's promising inflation figures. Those gains disappeared after the
Fed's mid-morning money market operations made it clear to Wall Street that
the authorities were not ready to ease monetary policy just yet. There was a
late afternoon rally, but it lacked conviction.
The over-the-counter market was troubled by disappointing first quarter
earnings from Apple Computer. Apple tumbled Dollars 9 1/2 or 13 per cent to
Dollars 62 1/4 , on turnover of over 15m shares, after the company reported
profit of Dollars 1.07 per share for the first three months of 1991. The
market had been expecting a better showing and analysts quickly downgraded
their second quarter earnings forecasts.
NCR, the computer group fighting off an unwanted bid from AT&amp;T, slipped
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 96 5/8 on news that its earnings fell from 73 cents
a share to 70 cents a share in the first quarter. In a recent special ballot
AT&amp;T failed to win the 80 per cent support of shareholders required to
remove NCR's board of directors. AT&amp;T shares rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 35
3/4 .
Tonka, the toy manufacturer, fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 4 3/4 after Hasbro
said it was ready to raise its bid for Tonka debentures but lower its offer
for the company's common stock. The new offer, which increases the total
value of the bid from Dollars 470m to Dollars 486m, left Hasbro shares
Dollars  1/4 lower at Dollars 26 on the American stock exchange.
Among financial stocks PaineWebber edged Dollars  1/2 higher to Dollars 24
3/8 (the shares had been more than Dollars 1 higher earlier on) after the
company reported a threefold increase in first quarter profits to Dollars
31m. A big rise in income at Smith Barney, the securities subsidiary of
Primerica, helped the financial services group make a 30 per cent
improvement in first quarter earnings. News of the 95 cents a share profit
lifted Primerica's stock Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 32 3/8 .
The market also responded favourably to Chase Manhattan, up Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 18 7/8 in brisk trading after it unveiled a rise in opening quarter
income from 20 cents a share to 73 cents a share.
Canada
Toronto stocks closed slightly higher in trendless trade after fluctuating
in a narrow range in line with first quarter earnings results from the US.
Investors are waiting for further signs of a discount rate cut by the Fed.
The composite index closed 7.04 up at 3516.43. Advances led declines by 278
to 266 on volume of 25.1m shares.
'First quarter earnings results are coming in from the States. They've had
quite an effect on the markets both on the upside and the downside,' said Mr
Don Vialoux, a vice- president with Richardson Greenshields of Canada.

FT  16 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soaring gas sales show flaws in
Norway's strategy - The lack of a co-ordinated exports drive is creating
avoidable difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S lack of a national gas export strategy in the face of spiralling
demand is creating unnecessary difficulties.
The country is one of Europe's main suppliers of gas and has North Sea
reserves of two trillion cubic metres.
The existing organisation for exporting gas is Gassforhandlingsutvalg - the
Gas Negotiating Committee. This is under threat and the industry fears that
negotiations could become a fragmented free for all among companies which
own gas fields.
European gas demand is set to increase mainly because of increasing Soviet
difficulties meeting supply, and virtually no chance of increasing it, and
because of the 'green' trend in Europe where gas is considered a more
environmentally friendly replacement for oil and coal in power generation.
Under the giant Troll/Sleipner gas sales agreement signed in 1986 with a
consortium of European buyers 30.51bn cubic metres of gas is committed under
contract. However, the Sleipner East and Troll fields together have reserves
of just 26.5bn cubic metres. To fill the 4.01bn cubic metre shortfall, the
licences in the Troll field, operated by Statoil, the Norwegian state oil
company, have agreed to sell an additional 3.7bcm from two other fields -
Veslefrikk and Brage - on behalf of those field's respective owners.
For this service, the Troll field owners will charge the owners of
Veslefrikk and Brage a handling fee of five oere - there are 100 oere in
each Norwegian krone - per cubic metre of gas. This agreement forms the
basis of what is known in industry circles as the 'Troll Commercial Model'
which may mark the end of the gas negotiating committee. The committee
comprised Statoil, Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum and was established five
years ago to sell gas for Norway. This is a sensitive issue for it has
always been held that the three Norwegian companies were best placed to
protect sovereign interest in the country's international gas trade.
Also, the buyers of Troll gas have additional purchase options contained
within the sales agreement which could boost their total supply requirement
to 40.82bcm. However, before the European gas buyers will exercise these
purchase options, Norway must provide a guarantee that it can meet this
demand.
In order to provide this guarantee the owners of the Troll field have
identified four sources of Norwegian gas which they could sell on behalf of
these fields' owners as part of the Troll deal.
This would allow the Troll field to underwrite future gas sales - a
requirement of the buyers. However, the owners of these fields would also be
obliged to pay Troll owners a five oere per cubic metre handling fee. The
four fields being considered by Troll's owners include the Midgard
gas/condensate field, operated by Saga Petroleum and located in the
Norwegian Sea.
The Sleipner West field is also under considation. However, two other fields
being considered - Oseberg and Troll phase two - are both operated by Norsk
Hydro, which may not want to offer this gas to Troll field owners to sell
under the Troll agreement.
Instead, Norsk Hydro may want to negotiate its own sales with the hope of
securing contracts in Britain. Norwegian energy authorities, pondering over
a national gas export strategy, have also yet to decide whether all gas
field owners should be allowed to negotiate sales contracts on their own
behalf, or whether this should be done under the Troll Commercial Model.
The difficulty of gas transport capacity has been solved by the recent
decision to build a third export line from Norway to Europe. That would lift
export capacity to about 30bcm, although it could be doubled by adding
compressors. Owners in Britain's North Sea J-block field, however, have
asked Norway to assist them in transporting gas to Germany by allowing them
to tie a spur line into Norway's Norpipe line which runs to Emden in
Germany.
Britain seems prepared to allow new Norwegian imports into the UK if Norway
complies. However, if Norway allows J-block gas to be transported through
Norpipe it would interfere with the country's flexibility to negotiate new
gas sales contracts with new buyers such as East European countries which
have expressed interest in Norwegian gas.
Italy, which does not currently buy Norwegian gas, says it wants to purchase
5bcm annually from 1996. In order to maximise transport capacity in
pipelines, Norway is considering exporting gas from Snoehvit, a field off
northern Norway, to Italy in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Later this year an engineering study will start in the 2.5 trillion cubic
metre Shtokmanovskoye gas field in the Barents Sea 600km north east of
Murmansk and last for about one year. A decision on whether to develop
Shtokmanovskoye is to be taken next year.
The field, in 300 metres of water, is said to be one of the world's biggest
offshore gas fields.

FT  16 APR 91 / Government Bonds: US bonds mixed after Fed signals no rate
change

<DATELINE>

US GOVERNMENT bond prices eased at the short end but held their gains at the
long end yesterday after the Federal Reserve signalled no change in monetary
policy.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue was up  13/32 at 97
5/16 , to yield 8.108 per cent, while the two-year note was down 1/32 at 100
7/16 , yielding 6.863 per cent.
Prices at both ends of the market had opened firmer in anticipation of a
move from the Fed to lower interest rates.
Speculation had intensified over the weekend that rates would be cut, either
in the form of cheaper Fed funds or a reduction in the discount rate from 6
per cent, after last week's positive inflation news.
However, when the Fed arranged overnight matched sale-purchase agreements
around 10.45am, while Fed funds were trading at 5 1/2 per cent, prices fell
back immediately. The Fed's move to drain reserves from the system indicated
that it wished to see Fed funds trading at a higher rate than 5 1/2 per
cent.
The fact that the operations were executed an hour before the traditional
intervention-time of 11.30am to 11.45am suggested that the Fed wanted to
send the clearest signal possible to the markets that monetary policy had
not been eased, said analysts.
After the intervention Fed funds firmed to 6 1/4 per cent, above the target
last set of 6 per cent. Analysts said that the long end remained firm as the
market believed the delay in cutting interest rates indicated the Fed is
taking the inflation threat seriously.
In London, the gilts market opened a little higher, but prices were held
back by the prospect of further supply. An auction of short-dated stock
totalling Pounds 1bn to Pounds 2bn will be announced today, for sale next
week. Meanwhile the week's Pounds 800m tender of long-dated gilts remains
largely unsold. In addition, the recent surge of activity in the sterling
sector of the Eurobond market, including a further Pounds 350m of fixed-rate
supply yesterday, is further squeezing demand.
Some dealers said that there had been a little selling by foreign investors
who can take profits on the currency now that the pound is close to DM3.
The June long gilt contract on the London International Financial Futures
Exchange ended at 92 1/16 , down from Friday's close of 92 9/32 .
The rally in the German market appears to have stalled with prices slipping
after an initial rise. Matched sales by the US Federal Reserve, read as a
sign that further US rate cuts will be at least delayed, put pressure on the
short end of the market. Long Bunds outperformed the short end, causing the
yield curve to flatten.
The market has failed several times to breach resistance on the Bunds
futures contract at 86.20. The Bund contract on Liffe ended at 85.78, down
from Friday's closing level of 65.90.
The French bond market also continues to be led by the US market, but again
outperformed Germany yesterday, partly because it is better underpinned by
domestic demand, analysts said.
The margin between French and German 10-year government bonds has tightened
about five basis points more during the past week to reach the historically
narrow level of 57 basis points.

FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Few crumbs of comfort in US
corporate pie / Preview of the quarterly reporting season for American
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It will be bad, but the question is just how bad. Wall Street is bracing
itself for some nasty shocks as it enters the corporate results season for
the first quarter of this year - the period of maximum economic disruption
caused by the Gulf crisis.
Analysts have been cutting forecasts for sectoral profits since the start of
the year as a succession of gloomy profits warnings have emerged from a
range of companies. But in many cases they could still be over-optimistic.
Certainly, International Business Machines, the world's leading computer
manufacturer, took Wall Street completely by surprise last month when it
warned its earnings would be about half the consensus forecast, and half the
figure it reported in 1990. And last Friday IBM duly unveiled net earnings
from operations for the three months of Dollars 500m, half the Dollars 1bn
earned in the first quarter of 1990.
Analysts say IBM's initial announcement drove home the message that the
first quarter would be an exceptionally difficult one for corporate America.
It also focused market attention on the negative impact on reported overseas
earnings of a stronger dollar.
Consensus forecasts by 'bottom up', or sectoral analysts, always tend to
seem more optimistic than those of 'top down,' or broad strategic analysts,
partly for technical reasons.
But Mr Richard Pucci, who tracks forecasting trends for IBES, a research
service of brokers Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan, says the gap between the two has
been particularly wide for the past few months, although sectoral analysts
have been moving down towards their strategic colleagues.
But bad profits news from individual companies will not necessarily change
overall equity market sentiment since the latest reporting period was
distorted by the Gulf crisis and a great deal of bad news has already been
discounted by Wall Street.
Nevertheless, good or bad company news will clearly move individual stocks,
or sectors. Mr Laszlo Birinyi, a Wall Street strategist, notes that the
first trickle of better-than-expected results last week - for example from
high technology groups Motorola and Intel - produced an enthusiastic
response from investors.
'The market is very disposed towards being pleasantly surprised by corporate
earnings,' he added.
The securities industry is one sector Wall Street is relying upon to spread
some sunshine amid the corporate gloom. The big increases in share values,
the growth in equity and bond trading volume, and the revival of new stock
and bond issuances during the first quarter will have boosted revenues at
securities houses across the US.
Last week the stock market had a taste of what to expect when J. P. Morgan,
the blue-chip bank, reported strong quarterly earnings. To no one's
surprise, impressive growth in J. P. Morgan's revenue from securities
trading hogged the headlines.
Analysts are hoping for more of the same from Wall Street's other big names.
In commercial banking, the main focus of attention will be the large New
York money centre banks, from a sharp rise in non-performing loans, mainly
to the property sector and highly leveraged transactions. Analysts expect
many of the banks to report a 10 to 20 per cent increase in non-performing
loans during the quarter.
Citicorp, the largest bank in the US, has already announced it expected its
portfolio of doubtful loans to rise by about Dollars 1bn this quarter -
roughly the same as in the third and fourth quarters of last year.
Bank of New York, the first big bank to report its results, surprised the
market last week when it reported a first-quarter loss because of soured
commercial loans. But unlike its rivals, it did not make particularly heavy
provisions last year, so its results are not expected to set a trend.
The computer industry may show sharp divergences in performance. IBM's poor
figures are expected to be mirrored by several fellow manufacturers of
mainframe and mini computers. For example, NCR - on the receiving end of a
bid from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph - and Amdahl have announced new
mainframes but have yet to ship them. And corporate buyers may have been put
off heavy investment in mainframes by the Gulf uncertainty and general
recession.
In contrast, many manufacturers of personal computers and workstations seem
to be prospering, despite the economic downturn. For example, Sun
Microsystems is expected to report strong earnings increases.
The same cannot be said of the motor industry, which is suffering from a
deep depression. Each of Detriot's Big Three is expected to report large
losses due to lower sales volume and heavy price discounting. Nor are
analysts hopeful of them returning to the black in the second quarter.
The motor industry's woes will also have a knock-on effect on the steel
industry, hit by plunging prices and weak demand. Virtually none of the big
six manufacturers is expected to report a first-quarter operating profit,
and the outlook for the rest of the year is not much better.
For the travel industry, at the forefront of the Gulf crisis' repercussions,
the picture is more mixed. Doubtlessly the first quarter will look horrid:
two of the big hotel groups, Hilton and Marriott, have already reported
profits more than halved, while large airlines like United and American have
warned of losses for the first three months of 1991.
The interest here, however, centres less on the historic data than on the
speed and extent to which business is bouncing back. Any indicators on that
front will be keenly noted.
The pharmaceuticals sector is expected to be one of the few bright spots.
Analysts predict a particularly strong first quarter from Merck.
Bristol-Myers, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer and Syntex are also expected to
post sharp gains. However, results may be muddied by one-time items as
companies start to comply with recent changes in accounting for retiree
benefits.
For the oil industry, strength in Europe and the Far East in refining and
marketing should bolster first-quarter earnings. Mr Paul Mlotok, an analyst
at Morgan Stanley, expects the oil majors to see a 15 per cent improvement
in earnings on average, with particularly strong performances from Exxon,
Chevron and Texaco. Higher crude oil prices in January because of the Gulf
war should help production profits. Although the recession has reduced
demand for refined products, the impact is not expected to be dramatic.
The outlook for the chemical industry, where earnings dropped by about 30
per cent in 1990, remains bleak. Over-capacity at a time of falling demand
is the main culprit.
Those with the greatest exposure to commodity chemicals, such as Dow
Chemical and Union Carbide, are expected to be the hardest hit. While the
more diversified companies, such as Monsanto, should see only a modest
deterioration in profits.

HASBRO, the biggest US toymaker which has offered Dollars 470m to acquire
Tonka, maker of Monopoly, Play-doh and Tonka trucks, yesterday said it was
willing to change the terms of its bid in an attempt to appease disgruntled
bondholders who have not been willing to tender under terms of Hasbro's
initial offer.
Hasbro, which last week said it might drop its bid if the deal is not
completed quickly, said it would increase the price for Tonka's 16 1/4 per
cent series A debentures to 92.8 cents on the dollar from 80 cents on the
dollar.
Hasbro will also raise its offer for Tonka's 17 1/4 per cent series B
debentures to 93.2 cents on the dollar from 75 cents, provided at least 90
per cent of holders of each series agrees to the revised offer.
However, the new bid is contingent on Tonka's stockholders accepting a
reduced offer of Dollars 5 a share from Dollars 7 a share.
On Wall Street, shares in Tonka dropped 63 cents to Dollars 4 3/4 yesterday.
Hasbro said the Water Street Corporate Recovery Fund, a unit of Goldman
Sachs which owns more than half the Hasbro bonds, had been unwilling to
accept the company's previous offer but was prepared to accept the revised
bid.
Tonka's board is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to consider amending the
merger agreement. The new offer increases the total value of Hasbro's bid to
Dollars 486m.

UPJOHN, the US pharmaceuticals and health care services company, yesterday
recorded a 15 per cent improvement in first-quarter earnings from continuing
operations on an 11 per cent gain in sales.
The company, which makes the Rogaine treatment for baldness and the Xanax
anti-anxiety drug, had net income of Dollars 133.3m on sales of Dollars
799.4m in the first quarter ended March 31, against net earnings of Dollars
114.3m on sales of Dollars 723.4m a year earlier.
Operating income rose 3 per cent in the latest quarter to Dollars 180m.
Upjohn spent Dollars 115.3m, or 14 per cent of sales, on research and
development in the first three months of 1991.
Sales of health care products rose 10 per cent, led by Ansaid, a
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, and Rogaine.
American Cyanamid, whose operations include drugs, medical products,
chemicals and agricultural products, lifted first-quarter net earnings from
Dollars 90.9m, or 95 cents a share, to Dollars 104.8m, or Dollars 1.12, on
sales up to Dollars 1.31bn from Dollars 1.15bn.

to GE

<TEXT>
A DIVERSE mix of businesses enabled General Electric to overcome much of the
impact of the recession in the first quarter, with a 5 per cent advance in
net earnings and improved margins.
The Connecticut-based conglomerate, whose interests range from power
turbines to broadcasting, posted net income of Dollars 999m, or Dollars 1.15
a share, up from Dollars 950m, or Dollars 1.06 a share, a year earlier.
Revenues rose 6 per cent to Dollars 13.3bn.
Operating margins widened to 12.1 per cent from 11.8 per cent, the highest
ever for a first quarter. The company said that its productivity improved at
an annualised rate of more than 5 per cent.
Mr Jack Welch, GE chairman, said that while the company might continue to be
cushioned by its diversity, it sees no evidence that the surge in consumer
confidence which followed the end of the Gulf war is being followed by any
'meaningful' pick-up in business activity.
The strongest growth in earnings came from what GE calls its 'long-cycle'
capital goods businesses, chiefly aircraft engines, power station equipment
and medical systems. But a company official declined to give precise details
of the improvement in these divisions.
Earnings at GE Financial Services, which includes GE Capital and the
brokerage firm Kidder Peabody, advanced by 15 per cent.
GE Capital's results were tarnished however, by lower operating income in
its highly-leveraged buyouts and commercial real estate businesses.

first-quarter deficit

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOISE Cascade, the Idaho-based forest products group, suffered a loss in the
first three months of this year and has warned that its performance in the
current quarter may be even worse.
Weak markets, exacerbated by higher costs and interest rates, pushed the
company into a Dollars 16.9m loss (53 cents a share), compared to a Dollars
33.6m profit (73 cents), a year earlier. Sales slipped to Dollars 992.7m
from Dollars 1.1bn.
As part of its response to the recession, Boise is cutting its capital
spending budget to about Dollars 300m this year, only slightly more than one
third the 1990 level. The Dollars 2bn it has spent on capital investment in
the past three years is the chief cause of the higher first-quarter interest
and depreciation charges.
The company said that prices have eroded for most grades of paper which it
produces, as well as for its wood products. Uncoated white papers, its
largest single grade, have been especially hard hit.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BP is seeking a buyer for Tex/Con Oil and Gas, a wholly-owned Texas-based
subsidiary which holds all the British company's onshore natural gas
interests in the US, excluding Alaska.
BP Exploration yesterday declined to comment on its plans for Tex/Con. But
sources in the energy industry said the sale would be in keeping with BP's
shift of emphasis in its exploration activities from the lower 48 US states
to 'frontier' areas, such as Alaska and central and south America.
An analyst in London said Tex/Con is likely to fetch between Dollars 650 and
Dollars 1bn. According to US reports, BP has appointed investment bank JP
Morgan to handle the sale, and prospective buyers will soon be invited to
inspect details of Tex/Con's financial and operating condition in New York
and Houston.
Tex/Con's business, which includes exploration, production and pipelines, is
centred in Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. It has interests in 3,000 wells
and operates 1,500 miles of gas-gathering pipelines. Tex/Con produces about
11,800 barrels of oil and 121m cu ft of gas a day.
BP does not disclose revenue or profit figures for Tex/Con. But low natural
gas prices, an inability to fully replace reserves and falling oil
production appear to have contributed to BP's disillusion with Tex/Con,
which was set up as an autonomous, entrepreneurial venture. Staff numbers
have been sharply cut back in recent months as part of an effort to reduce
overhead.
The company's problems came into public view last week when BP announced
that Tex/Con's chief executive Mr Bill Johnson was taking early retirement.
Mr Johnson has been replaced by Mr Bill Sears, formerly vice-president for
offshore exploration.
While cutting back its exploration presence in the US, BP has been expanding
in other parts of the western hemisphere. It recently opened an office in
Caracas, Venezuela, and has become increasingly active in Colombia.

FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: PaineWebber boosted by strong
retail demand
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PAINEWEBBER, one of Wall Street's biggest securities houses, yesterday
reported a near-threefold rise in first-quarter profits to Dollars 31.6m,
aided by strong demand for its retail broking services.
The independent company's first-quarter income of Dollars 1.09 a share was
193 per cent higher than the 20 cents a share (Dollars 10.8m) made in the
opening three months of 1990. The figures were well received by the market
yesterday, and the company' stock risen Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 24 3/8 .
PaineWebber, capitalised at Dollars 1.55bn, is the third big Wall Street
house, after J. P. Morgan and Smith Barney, to announce a robust improvement
in first-quarter profits.
Since the beginning of the year the significant increase in bond and stock
trading volume, and the boom in equity values has boosted securities
industry revenues, in the process helping Wall Street recover from 1990, its
worst year on record.
PaineWebber said that all of its main business groups prospered in the first
quarter, when net revenues were Dollars 474.8m, up 11 per cent on the
Dollars 426m at the same stage in 1990.
Retail broking and asset management were particularly strong, helped by the
return to the stock market of many of the individual investors scared away
in 1987 by the October market crash. In the quarter retail broking revenues
rose by 15.4 per cent, while retail customer assets increased to a record
Dollars 80.2bn, up from Dollars 67.1bn a year earlier.
The company's institutional fixed income and core equity businesses also
performed well in the healthy environment for bond and stock prices.
Investment banking revenues, however, fell to Dollars 47m, down from the
Dollars 67m earned in the first quarter of 1990. PaineWebber's recent
experiences in investment banking have not been successful - last year it
was forced to take a Dollars 71m increase in reserves for merchant banking
activities to cover losses on junk bond-related investments - and the firm
is concentrating on retail stock broking.
Total expenses at PaineWebber rose from Dollars 408.9m in the first quarter
of 1990 to Dollars 426m.

<TEXT>
ELI LILLY, the large US pharmaceuticals company, yesterday unveiled a 14 per
cent advance in first-quarter after-tax profits, in line with the strength
in the drugs sector.
The group made Dollars 495.8m in the three months to the end of March,
compared with Dollars 430.1m in the same period a year ago.
The profit figures were scored on sales of Dollars 1.44bn, up 16 per cent on
the previous year's figure. Eli said the improvement derived largely from
volume increases in both its domestic and international markets.
Among the main product contributors were Axid, which treats ulcers; Ceclor,
an antibiotic and Eli Lilly's top seller; Humulin, a genetically-engineered
insulin; Humantrope, a growth hormone also genetically-engineered by Eli
Lilly; and Prozac, the antidepressant, which has run into some controversy,
provoking lawsuits which claim that the drug has harmful side-effects.
Eli Lilly acknowledged that cost increases outstripped sales growth in the
quarter, saying that the rise in marketing and administrative expenses from
Dollars 303.6m to Dollars 365.7m reflected added promotional costs on newer
products.
Research and development expenditure advanced to Dollars 184.5m from Dollars
163.1m.

REYNOLDS METALS, second-largest US aluminium group, suffered a 64 per cent
fall in first-quarter net earnings, from Dollars 77.7m or Dollars 1.31 a
share to Dollars 27.5m or 46 cents.
But results should improve 'significantly' during the rest of the year, said
Mr Bill Bourke, chairman, 'especially with the economic recovery anticipated
in the second half.'
He said the impact of the recession, which began in the second half of 1990,
worsened in the latest quarter.
'While the price of primary aluminium ingot was down only slightly from the
levels of a year ago, lower prices and volume for a number of fabricated
products further eroded margins,' he added.
Reynolds' revenues in the quarter slipped from Dollars 1.39bn to Dollars
1.38bn, but its aluminium shipments increased from 319,700 tonnes to 322,100
tonnes.

Primerica
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECORD earnings from Wall Street brokerage firm Smith Barney helped boost
first-quarter earnings of Primerica, the US financial services group, by 27
per cent.
Smith Barney's contribution of Dollars 29.3m made up more than a quarter of
Primerica's net income of Dollars 105.9m, or 95 cents a share, which was up
from Dollars 83.2m, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier.
Primerica, controlled by Wall Street veteran Mr Sandy Weill, reported
however, that sales of life insurance policies have continued to drop.
The number of policies sold by its insurance brokerage subsidiary, Primerica
Financial Services, tumbled to 79,500 in the quarter, from 122,700 a year
earlier. The value of new policies issued dropped to Dollars 14.3m from
Dollars 20.1m. None the less, improved margins helped lift the insurance
brokerage unit's earnings by 11 per cent.
Primerica Financial, formerly known as AL Williams, has the largest life
insurance sales force in the US.
Smith Barney attributed its 124 per cent jump in earnings to robust
securities markets as well as lower expenses.
Trading revenues jumped by 85 per cent and commissions by 16 per cent,
thanks to growth in institutional and retail business.
Primerica has been widely criticised for buying Smith Barney, one of Wall
Street's most venerable firms, for twice its book value a few months before
the 1987 market crash.

MCGRAW-HILL, the big US publishing, information services and broadcasting
group, saw first-quarter profits fall by more than a fifth.
With a small gain in operating profits from broadcasting and a larger
improvement from financial services offset by falls on the publishing front,
McGraw-Hill turned in Dollars 12.7m after tax, compared with Dollars 16.5m a
year earlier. Revenues were static at Dollars 428.5m (Dollars 420m).
At the operating level, profits were down from Dollars 41.4m to Dollars
35.1m, after taking in losses of Dollars 15.3m (Dollars 12.8m deficit) from
the company's share of the Macmillan/McGraw-Hill school publishing joint
venture.
McGraw said that the decline in profits had been expected, although its
shares still weakened on the news, slipping Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 58 7/8
.
A strong performance by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, lay behind
the advance in the financial services division's profits, from Dollars 32.1m
to Dollars 37.9m.

FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Question mark put over insurers
by S&amp;P
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST 500 US insurance companies had a question mark placed against their
claims-paying ability in a new survey, published yesterday, by Standard &amp;
Poor's, the US ratings agency.
Although many of the 489 companies - drawn from both the life and
property/casualty sectors - are small, they wrote an aggregate Dollars
18.3bn-worth of premiums in 1989.
S&amp;P stressed that not all of these are necessarily in danger, but suggested
their financial condition was 'below average' and they 'deserve close
attention'.
The agency's findings come at a sensitive time for the US insurance
industry. The issue of solvency regulation - and whether the state
regulatory system is adequate or whether a Federal agency should be set up -
has been under scrutiny for many months.
It was given a further twist last week when the main operating unit of First
Executive, the large Los Angeles-based insurer, was taken over by the
Californian state regulators - the largest-ever insurance company seizure.
The new S&amp;P survey centres on the large number of US insurers who fall
outside its normal claims-paying ranking service. In the past, S&amp;P has
concentrated on analysing some 450 insurance companies. This full analysis
is done with the companies' co-operation, and they pay for the service.
However, the new study looks at a further 1,600 companies on the basis of
returns made to the state insurance departments. S&amp;P acknowledges these
studies are less fullsome and, therefore, only places companies into one of
three broad categories - 'above average', 'average' and 'below'.
It said yesterday that, of the 489 companies in the lowest category, 329
were in the life and health industry, and 133 in property-casualty. Another
27 reinsurers also fell into this range. About 150 life companies and a like
number of P/C insurers made the top grade. Mr John Garamendi, the California
Insurance Commissioner, said yesterday that - on current legal advice - he
believed that the state insurance guaranty fund should cover policyholders
of Executive Life, the main operating unit of First Executive seized by the
regulators last week.
However, not all policyholders will be covered for the full amount of the
benefits promised by the insurer. Because the Californian fund only came
into operation in January, there was a question over whether it would cover
First Executive at all if the insurer was deemed to be impaired before that.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Waiting for carpets to bag a reasonable
pile - The receiver's attempt to sell Lowndes Queensway's Carpetland chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER CHAPTER in the saga of Lowndes Queensway, the furniture and carpet
retailer which went into receivership in August last year, could soon be
written.
The chain's carpet business, which trades under the Carpetland name in
England and General George in Scotland, has been formally put up for sale by
Ernst &amp; Young, the receiver.
Unusually for a receiver, Ernst &amp; Young has produced the sort of glossy
marketing brochure which is more typical of an information memorandum
produced by a merchant bank for a more conventional trade sale. The brochure
has been sent to more than 20 possible purchasers in the UK and continental
Europe, all companies with some retail connection, and some responses have
already come in.
Mr Terry Carter, the Ernst &amp; Young partner dealing with Lowndes, says the
firm considered calling in a merchant bank to organise the sale but decided
its own corporate finance department could handle the deal.
Lowndes was formed by a Pounds 450m leveraged buy-out of Harris Queensway,
Sir Phil Harris's business, in summer 1988. Mr James Gulliver, who headed
the buy-out, had started negotiations with Sir Phil in the spring.
Ironically, just as the talks started, UK base rates started to reverse
their previous downward trend. By the time the deal was struck, interest
rates were climbing again.
That rise in rates was to be Lowndes' undoing. Higher interest rates both
depressed sales in the stores, and increased the cost of the debt taken on
to finance the deal.
Even more ironically, the receivers were called in on the night of August 14
last year, only a few weeks before the first cut in interest rates came.
When Mr Carter moved in he found a business with nearly Pounds 200m of bank
loans, about 430 shops open, and sizeable on-going trading losses.
The first hope was to sell the businesses off as going concerns, and a
number of small deals were done. Since then 85 stores have been sold and
contracts to sell another 12 have been exchanged. A further 52 have been
dealt with, such as leases being surrendered to landlords, and Mr Carter
says, there are offers on another 40 and expressions of interest in more.
Meanwhile, Lowndes customers who had paid deposits have had their money
back.
One idea originally discussed was a management buy-out of the carpet
business. But, says Mr Carter, by November this had been ruled out as
conditions were simply not favourable to a deal. Having recognised that, Mr
Carter says, he had to see what could be made out of the business.
After cost-cutting and store closures, the reduction in size from 150,000 to
15,000 sq ft of a huge carpet-cutting centre, reductions in staff to about
830 people, and the establishment of a management team under Mr Ray
Nethercott, a budget could be produced.
This showed that, assuming no worsening in the economic climate, Carpetland
should be able to make sales of about Pounds 50m and profits of perhaps
Pounds 1m in the current financial year, to end-January 1992.
Such is the operational gearing in retailing, that once the fixed costs are
covered, any rise in turnover would feed through rapidly to profits without
much in the way of marginal costs. The shops were operating at much higher
turnover levels back in the consumer boom of the late 1980s and the
implication is that Carpetland could make much higher profits in future
years.
This analysis persuaded Mr Carter, and the banks owed money by Lowndes, that
it was better not to sell off Carpetland at any price but to hold on for a
higher one.
Unfortunately the same could not be said for the furniture side, now cut
back to about 115 shops, with a turnover running at about Pounds 500,000 a
week.
The plan for this business continues to be to sell off shops in dribs and
drabs, with outlets kept trading in the meantime to offset at least some of
their costs.
However, Mr Carter is hoping that a buyer for Carpetland could be persuaded
that a purchase now would be the opportunity for a bargain. A lot of
reconstruction work has already been done - not least the painful task of
cutting staff numbers.
Mr Carter is optimistic that Carpetland has a future, and reckons it has
about 5 per cent of the UK carpet market.
The book value of the Carpetland business is about Pounds 20m, including
stock, although no value has been ascribed to short-lease properties, and a
majority of the shops are owned on this basis. However, analysts feel that
the likely sale price would include negative, rather than positive,
goodwill.
With luck, Mr Carter hopes to complete the Carpetland sale by mid-May but
realises that the date may slip beyond that. On the other hand, he stresses
this is not a fire sale, and though receivers are not normally long-term
holders of companies, he is content to keep the busi-ness until the best
offer - which could yet come from a management buy-out - can be obtained.
While the Lowndes receivership is likely to drag on for some time yet, and
the banks are now resigned to taking a substantial loss on their loans, at
least part of the Lowndes business could soon be in the hands of a long-term
owner again.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAWKER SIDDELEY, the diversified engineering group, has become the second
British company to win a significant order to manufacture components for the
Boeing 777 wide bodied aircraft.
HS will today announce it has won an order worth about Pounds 90m to
manufacture flaps for the tail section of the 777, which is due to come into
service from 1995.
This follows the announcement last week that Smiths Industries, the
aerospace and medical equipment group, had won orders worth about Pounds
337m for computer systems to manage the aircraft's fuel and electrical power
systems.
The Boeing order comes as HS is beset by rumours that it may become a
candidate for a take-over bid from either BTR or Hanson, the industrial
conglomerates. HS last month reported a 30 per cent fall in pre-tax profits
after exceptional items.
The elevator flaps will be manufactured by HS's Australian aerospace
subsidiary, Hawker de Havilland, which is a long-standing supplier of wing
flaps to Boeing.
The deal is an important boost for the HS aerospace division, which last
year increased profits by 20 per cent to Pounds 22m, on a 10 per cent
increase in turnover to Pounds 297m, about 14 per cent of the HS group
sales.

FT  16 APR 91 / Leading insurer to close NZI Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Accident, one of the UK's leading insurers, is to wind down its New
Zealand bank subsidiary, NZI Bank, ending its unprofitable foray into
Australasian banking.
Mr Barry Holder, general manager of GA, said of the decision: 'This is a
positive but a possibly unpalatable move.'
GA acquired the bank when it bought a majority stake in NZI Corporation in
June 1988.
It will retain control of NZI's insurance subsidiary, which is one of New
Zealand's biggest insurers, as a base for developing its activities in the
Pacific Basin.
GA's overall losses as a result of the deal are expected to amount to at
least Pounds 200m. Mr Holder said that GA had been seeking a buyer for NZI
Bank soon after acquiring majority control of the company.
GA was taken aback by the deterioration of the bank's loan book, sustaining
operating losses of more than Pounds 70m between 1988 and 1990.
Mr Holder accepted yesterday that the acquisition of the bank had been 'a
mistake'.
GA had now restored the bank to profitability - pre-tax profits of NZDollars
7.8m (Pounds 2.6m) were recorded in 1990.
However, it had been unable to find a buyer and was now seeking to unload
the bank's Australasian loan portfolio, cash management accounts in New
Zealand and a merchant bank in Singapore.
Mr Holder said that the bank was now fully provided for against any future
losses that might arise on its remaining business. 'I do not expect any
further surprises,' he said.
NZI Bank chairman, Mr Jim Macaulay, said he expected most of the 27,000
depositors would accept repayment within six months. But, if the loans could
not be sold, it would take up to five years to wind down the bank totally.
The bank handed out redundancy notices to 90 of its 360 staff yesterday and
will be terminating the contracts of a further 30 employees before the end
of the week.
Mr Macaulay said the closure should be seen as the first move in a shake-out
of the overcrowded New Zealand banking sector, which was deregulated in
1987. The number of registered banks had risen in that time from four to 21.

FT  16 APR 91 / Airtours seeks Pounds 15m in share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS has become the latest holiday company to come to the market for
funds to take advantage of last month's demise of International Leisure
Group, the UK's second largest tour operator.
The Lancashire-based company is raising Pounds 15.4m in a share placing and
offer to shareholders that will greatly increase its holiday capacity. This
follows a Pounds 28.9m rights issue from Owners Abroad last month, which
also attributed the cash call to opportunities provided by the collapse of
ILG.
The exit of ILG from the tour operators' league, headed by Thomson, has left
Owners in second place, through its Falon and Redwing subsidiaries, and
Airtours third.
Mr Peter Hilliar, leisure analyst with BZW, estimated that of the 1.5m
holidays that ILG might have provided this year, Thomson would get about
300,000, and Owners and Airtours about 200,000 each. Airtours carried
720,000 customers in 1989-90.
The loss of a big competitor will also cushion the decline in the foreign
package holiday market: only 9m UK holidaymakers are expected to be carried
this year, compared with 10m in 1990.
Mr Harry Coe, Airtours' finance director, said the Pounds 15.4m would enable
the company to expand without hitting the limits set by the Civil Aviation
Authority to protect customers.
The issue of 5m shares, at 320p each, will increase Airtours' share capital
by 30 per cent. It follows the rise in the share price from 156p in January
to 373p earlier this month. Before that the company had not regained its
March 1987 flotation price of 180p since the stock market crash of that
year.
Shareholders taking up the offer can do so on a three-for-ten basis. The
proportion of shares held by directors is expected to fall from 70 per cent
before the issue to less than 50 per cent after. Mr David Crossland,
chairman, who holds 8.2m of the existing 16.6m shares, is not taking up the
bulk of his entitlement. His brother-in-law Mr Tom Trickett, a director
coming up to retirement, is placing part of his stake.
For the six months to March 31, Airtours is forecast to cut its seasonal
pre-tax loss from Pounds 8m to Pounds 4m, or Pounds 6.5m after the start-up
costs of its five-aircraft airline.
For the full year, its house broker BZW is forecasting that pre-tax profit
will more than double from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 13.2m, with earnings per
share of 48p.

FT  16 APR 91 / A General Accident waiting to happen: An ill-fated
diversification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Accident's decision to break up or close down the banking operations
of its New Zealand subsidiary, NZI Corporation, could be said to close a
sorry chapter of acquisitions by the UK's leading insurers.
Within the last six months two other companies - Prudential Corporation and
Guardian Royal Exchange - have both disposed of expensive acquisitions made
since 1986 and incurred heavy losses as a result.
Prudential accepted last month that its losses from selling off its estate
agency chain would amount to Pounds 334m. GRE announced late last year that
the costs of writing off its investment in an ill-judged venture in the
Italian insurance market would amount to about Pounds 70m. Now it is Perth's
turn to bite the bullet.
GA spent about Pounds 460m acquiring NZI Corporation in 1988 and 1989, then
sustained costs of over Pounds 100m in operating losses and interest
charges. It is now left with an insurance company that has net assets worth
anything between Pounds 250m and Pounds 400m. Losses on the deal look likely
therefore to be be at least Pounds 200m, roughly 14 per cent of the
company's shareholders' funds at the end of 1990.
GA's problems down under can be traced to the climate of the mid-1980s, when
its assets were growing strongly because of rising share prices and
property. GA felt the need to expand. 'They were under pressure to do
something,' says Mr Chris Pountain, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, 'there
was a feeling they'd run out of ideas.'
Mr Ian Menzies, a corporate financier who joined GA from Schroders merchant
bank in 1985, helped introduce sophisticated financial engineering skills to
a company long dominated by a conservative actuarial approach. In 1986, GA
bought the Ontario motor insurer, Pilot.
Two years later, acting quickly and in the face of a lot of competition, GA
paid Pounds 353.2m for a 51 per cent stake in NZI, including a 38 per cent
stake bought from Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur. GA paid
for that partially by backing some of its existing Australasian assets into
NZI. In 1989 GA purchased the remaining minority interests in NZI for Pounds
110m.
NZI, formed in 1981 when the New Zealand Insurance Company merged with the
South British Group, had long been regarded as one of the most competent and
profitable insurers in Australasia. It was - and remains  - the biggest
insurer in New Zealand with a market share of over 22 per cent, and had
built up impressive shares of Pacific Rim markets like Malaysia, Singapore,
Thailand and the Philippines.
GA felt NZI was well placed to benefit from the steady growth in the
region's insurance business. According to Mr Tom Bennett, an analyst with
Banque Paribas Capital Markets, the potential for growth in the Pacific
Basin made GA believe that it was 'backing certain winners'.
Enthusiasm for the area led GA to underestimate problems linked to the size
and character of the group's banking business, which had been built up in
the mid-1980s.
Mr Barry Holder, GA's current general manager, who has been leading the
group's efforts to unravel the bank's problems, says: 'Within five minutes
of acquiring the bank we wanted to sell it.'
Provisions against bad loans increased by four times from March 1988 to
March 1989. Defaults on some big commercial property loans in Australia,
coupled with the collapse of large number of corporate customers in New
Zealand, were largely responsible, said Mr Holder.
Mr Holder says that GA 'was locked into the bank by buying a good insurance
business' but accepts that the purchase of the bank was 'a mistake'. The
group has successfully turned round the bank - it earned a small profit last
year. Efforts to find a buyer have been bedevilled, however, by New
Zealand's economic problems and widespread scepticism among international
bankers about prospects for Australasian markets in general.
So the bank will now be wound down. Mr Menzies, the corporate financier,
left GA at the end of last autumn. The group now intends to concentrate on
its insurance business, emphasising its traditional strengths of sound
underwriting. Mr Holder, its general manager, said yesterday: 'Credit risk
assessment is bankers' business . . . still fraught with difficulties in
that part of the world.' The group intends to move back towards a more
conorientation which has been followed since the conclusion of a strategic
review last year.
GA undertook the review following the overhaul of senior management which
took place in the wake of the retirement of its former chief general
manager, Mr Buchan Marshall, at the end of 1989. 'We decided to refocus on
our traditional strengths,' said Mr Marshall's successor, Mr Nelson
Robertson, last year.
The group has already embarked upon an extensive rationalisation of its UK
business. Announcing pre-tax losses of Pounds 121m in March, Mr Robertson
said he aimed to reduce staff costs by as much as 20 per cent in the
company's branch network.
On the surface, GA is now well placed to consolidate. The resurgence in the
stock market since January has helped to produce a recovery in GA's asset
base and strengthened the group's solvency ratio (net worth as a percentage
of premiums).
But some - smaller - banana skins still lie ahead. The possible
nationalisation by the Ontario provincial government of the local motor
insurance industry would wrest control of the successful Pilot subsidiary
from GA, leading to possible losses of Pounds 12m. GA's chain of estate
agents has been losing money. And, although the company is confident that no
further provisions will be needed for NZI Bank, some analysts are sceptical.
Even if there is no further price to pay, however, the memory of the 1980s
burst of expansion is likely to trouble GA's cautious, conservative managers
for years to come.

FT  16 APR 91 / Saunders' ill health raised in appeal court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEALTH of Mr Ernest Saunders, the former head of Guinness, could be a
serious issue in appeals by him and two other men jailed last year for their
part in the Guinness affair, the Court of Appeal heard yesterday.
Medical evidence is to be called during the appeals, which opened yesterday
and are expected to last two weeks.
Mr Anthony Shaw, counsel for Mr Saunders, said the health issue was of
paramount concern to Mr Saunders and those representing him. It was relevant
to Mr Saunders' appeal against his five-year sentence and, arguably, also
his appeal against conviction.
The nature of Mr Saunders' illness was not specified in court, though
reference was made to him having been seen by a neurologist.
Mr Saunders, who was jailed last August, sat in court with one of his
co-appellants, Mr Anthony Parnes, a City stockbroker, jailed for
two-and-a-half years. Both men are serving their sentences in Ford open
prison in West Sussex.
The third appellant, Mr Gerald Ronson, head of the Heron group, was not in
court. He was freed from Ford in February after serving just under half his
12-month sentence.
The three men are appealing against convictions and sentences resulting from
their involvement in an illegal share support operation mounted by Guinness
during its takeover battle for Distillers in 1986.
Mr Saunders was convicted of stealing Pounds 8m from Guinness, conspiracy
and false accounting. Mr Parnes was sentenced for false accounting and
stealing Pounds 1.94m from Guinness. Mr Ronson was fined a record Pounds 5m
as well as being jailed after being convicted of conspiracy, the theft of
Pounds 2.875m from Guinness and false accounting.
Mr Michael Sherrard QC, for Mr Ronson, said the jury had been very seriously
misdirected about charges under section 151 of the 1985 Companies Act, under
which it was an offence for a company to give financial assistance for the
purchase of its own shares.
He said the judge had usurped the function of the jury, directing it that
section 151 offences involving dishonesty had been committed, in a situation
where the issue of dishonesty had been a factor common to all the charges.
Mr Sherrard also complained that the judge had 'diminished' the evidence of
Mr Olivier Roux, the former Guinness finance director and the principal
prosecution witness, whose account of events had largely supported Mr
Ronson's.
The appeals continue today.

FT  16 APR 91 / Turkey ready to set up more camps for Kurds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY yesterday said it was ready to set up more camps for Kurdish refugees
from Iraq, but stressed that they should be accompanied by additional camps
on the Iraqi side of the border.
As more Kurds streamed across the border, Turkish officials began moving
20,000 refugees down from the mountains to a site at Silopi, about 30 miles
inside Turkey. Earlier, official policy was to confine refugees close to the
border area. Silopi has tents supplied by the United Nations High Commission
for Refugees and will have a 400-bed hospital.
Most Kurdish refugees, however, will remain dependent on the international
air drop.
The promise of more camps came in London at a meeting between Mr John Major,
Britain's prime minister, and Mr Yildirim Akbulut, his Turkish counterpart.
According to Downing Street, Mr Akbulut said that Turkey had already
established some camps down from the mountains, but stressed it had to be a
reciprocal process.
Mr Akbulut and Mr Major agreed that the only lasting solution was for the
refugees to return home in safety, and Mr Major said he would encourage the
UN towards this objective.
The 45-minute meeting between Mr Major and Mr Akbulut, who was in London for
the launch of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, was
devoted to discussing the Kurds' plight.
Mr Akbulut said there were now 400,000 refugees from Iraq in Turkey and the
country was spending Pounds 1.5m a day on them.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, outlined the latest UK contributions
to the relief effort in a statement to the House of Commons. He told MPs
that Britain would send another six Chinook helicopters to Turkey this week,
bringing to nine the number of UK helicopters helping with the relief aid
drop. Mr Hurd added that Mrs Lynda Chalker, the overseas development
minister, would visit stricken border areas in Turkey and Iran later this
week.
International aid organisations based in Britain yesterday urged the British
government to find a political solution to the plight of the 1.5m Kurds in
the mountains along Iraq's borders with Turkey and Iran. Officials of eight
agencies, including the Red Cross, Oxfam, Christian Aid and Save the
Children Fund, said they had agreed with Mr Hurd and Ms Chalker on the
importance of providing humanitarian aid to the Kurdish refugees
immediately.
However, the aid agencies could not carry out their task properly until
there was a political solution providing the Kurdish refugees with
'demonstrable protection'.
Refugees start to panic, Page 4
The Iranian government claimed yesterday that Iraqi troops had crossed the
border on Sunday and were occupying an area three miles into Iran. In a
protest note to the UN, Tehran demanded the immediate withdrawal of the
Iraqis. Iraq hastily patched up its long border quarrel with Iran last
August, when it faced massive US and allied opposition to its invasion of
Kuwait. However, relations between the two countries have worsened recently.

MORE THAN 700,000 barrels of oil are estimated to be still on board the
Haven, the Cypriot-registered supertanker which has sunk off Italy's
north-west coast, threatening an environmental disaster in some of the most
scenic parts of the Mediterranean.
Admiral Antonio Alati, the harbourmaster at Genoa, said yesterday that some
724,000 barrels of the original 1m barrels remained on board. The 232,163
deadweight tonnes tanker - a sister vessel of the Amoco Cadiz which caused a
pollution disaster off France in 1978 - sank on Sunday after exploding and
catching fire.
Italian pollution experts say removing the crude oil may prove more
difficult and costly than cleaning up the oil already spilled.
The whole operation could cost as much as Dollars 50m (Pounds 28m). The
Italian government will be able to draw on funds for the clean-up from an
international fund set up by the International Maritime Organisation.
A formula based on the size of the ship makes the tanker owner, which is
registered as Venha Maritime in Cyprus, liable for the first Dollars 18m of
the clean-up cost. After that, the international fund will provide
supplementary payment up to Dollars 81.5m.
Good weather yesterday helped efforts to deal with the existing six-mile oil
slick by surface skimming. Light winds were blowing the slick towards the
French coast, causing concern in Monaco and on the French riviera that the
oil might wash ashore. Oil has reached Italian beaches.

FT  16 APR 91 / Progress seen on EC political union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNIFICANT progress on the road to European political union was claimed
yesterday by Luxembourg, current holder of the community presidency, in
advance of publication today of a draft treaty likely to set the final shape
of the union.
Mr Jacques Poos, Luxembourg foreign minister, speaking after a meeting with
EC counterparts, said that two important proposals had the backing of most
member countries. These cover a common foreign and security policy and an
increase in law-making power for the European parliament.
The probable final shape of political union in the community is due to
emerge today when a draft treaty is to be presented by the Luxembourg
presidency.
The treaty would create the common EC foreign and security policy (CFSP),
set parliamentary powers for Strasbourg, give EC citizens the vote elsewhere
in the community, and cut the commission to one representative for each of
the 12 member states' governments. The document would also endorse, for the
first time, inter-governmental co-operation among the Twelve on police and
immigration issues.
Tabling of the wide-ranging 95-page document comes after three months of
negotiation on political union, on which Luxembourg hopes to get agreement
by the end of June.
Revision of the EC treaty requires unanimous assent of the 12 member
governments, along with ratification by the 12 national parliaments. Mr
Poos, however, when describing the 'large majority' in favour of two of the
main proposals, said there were 'no irreducible differences' dividing that
majority from the dissenters such as Britain.
Under the Luxembourg compromise draft, the EC's new architecture would have
an overarching preamble referring to the aims of the 'European Union'.
The treaties proper would be divided into three, covering:
Standard Community activities, including the Treaty of Rome amended to
incorporate monetary union, and the EC's separate coal, steel and nuclear
treaties;
An area of mixed EC/national competence on the CFSP with some Commission
involvement and majority voting where at present there is none;
Codification of purely inter-governmental co-operation on judicial and
police issues, such as drugs, crime, political asylum and immigration visas.
To make the executive body more efficient, Luxembourg proposes only one
commissioner per country. Of the five larger states which currently have
two, only Britain so far backs this proposal.
The presidency has also adopted a Spanish proposal to allow EC citizens to
reside anywhere across the Community and to vote in local and EC polls.
Hitherto EC citizens have had a right to work, rather than to reside, in
each other's countries.
Yesterday's foreign ministers meeting displayed a majority in favour of
bringing eventually defence, as well as foreign and security policy, within
the EC. Within this majority, however, France and Italy expressed
disappointment that the presidency's draft was not more explicit about
incorporating the Western European Union (WEU) into the EC, and only called
for a review in 1996.
From the British side, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, UK European affairs minister,
said the WEU should only be mentioned alongside Nato, with the stipulation
that European defence should only be carried out through these two bodies.
The UK minister said the Luxembourg plan for majority voting on detailed
foreign policy decisions could lead to dissension, rather than coherence.
Also in opposition were Denmark, a non-WEU member which wants defence left
to Nato, Portugal, which wants majority voting on the basis of one vote per
country, and neutral Ireland which none the less seems relieved the plan
would not frontally challenge its neutrality until 1996.
The other significant area of broad agreement at the Luxembourg gathering
was the proposal to give the Strasbourg parliament an equal say with the
council of ministers on a select new category of fundamental laws.
Only the UK and Denmark opposed this outright. Others, such as France,
Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands took another tack to complain that
co-decision, involving setting up conciliation machinery between the
parliament and the council similar to that between the two houses of the US
Congress, might delay decision-making and squeeze the commission out.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY

<TEXT>
Mr William Waldegrave is doing a good job as secretary of state for health;
if political performance is the measure he is doing somewhat better than his
predecessor, Mr Kenneth Clarke. When the new chap took over at the beginning
of November the opinion polls rated concern about the national health
service at about level with anger at the poll tax, or even just above it.
Since then, worry about the NHS has steadily if gently declined, while the
community charge, closely followed by unemployment, has become the leading
issue.
Mr Clarke joined battle with the medical profession; Mr Waldegrave has made
love, not war. The second person he consulted, after Mr Clarke himself, was
Sir Norman Fowler, the former minister and unchallenged master of the art of
keeping out of political trouble while managing potentially dangerous
departments. Mr Waldegrave's immediate task was to introduce the reforms
that officially came into operation a fortnight ago. Did you notice anything
move? Neither did I. That was what he was supposed to achieve: slip the new
system in with the minimum of fuss and the least possible political damage.
Put it in place, but for the moment let it lie dormant. His more difficult
objective has been to persuade the electorate that you really can trust the
Tories with the health service. Honest, cross your heart and hope to die, it
is safe in our hands. So he must tell us.
Mr Waldegrave is trying his best to do just that. He produced a prose poem
at a recent Conservative party conference. 'To put it bleakly, we are all
equal in the presence of death,' said he. 'Pain and its relief are the same
for all.' Inequalities in pay, in status, in ability were acceptable because
they could only be suppressed by suppressing liberty. 'But in health, no . .
. our hearts revolt against the idea that one child with leukaemia should be
treated, and another not, because of the luck of the economic draw.' This is
not the kind of talk to which we became accustomed during the previous
decade.
The new minister's small achievement has not passed unnoticed. He is
sounding like a Labour spokesman for the health service. So the opposition
has chosen the NHS as the subject for tomorrow's debate in the House of
Commons. It wants to knock Mr Waldegrave about a bit. Labour will always
score tops in the public estimation of which party is likely to be a better
manager of the NHS, but the Conservatives' success in narrowing the gap over
the past six months may have begun to spoil its grand strategy.
That strategy is now obvious. Labour is running a permanent election
campaign, at a level of intensity that seems to increase every week. The
party's erstwhile strategic genius, Mr Peter Mandelson, helped Mr Neil
Kinnock produce a policy review in 1989. That was 'Meet the challenge, make
the change'. It was boiled down and re-edited to emerge last year as
'Looking to the future'. Mr Mandelson has a constituency to nurse, so last
October he resigned as director of communications. The party's new
strategists, directed by Dr John Cunningham, have learned the Mandelson
lesson - that the essence of salesmanship is repetition, enhanced by
incremental product development.
They are skilfully packaging and re-packaging the policy review papers,
moving out specialist lines, looking for niche markets. To take just two
recent examples, in February we were given 'Modern manufacturing strength';
in March 'A new ministry for women'. This morning the entire schmozzle will
be re-issued in a fresh edition, whose likely title, 'Opportunity Britain',
is a direct lift from Mr John Major. If Labour believes as firmly in the
rest of capitalism as it does in its marketing methods no one need fear a
Labour government.
The health niche is tackled in another product launch, 'A fresh start for
health'. If you read it carefully you find that the essence of the
government's new system has been accepted by Labour. The terminology is
different, but public purchasers of health care will contract with
providers. Labour wants to take the concepts of competition and a market in
health out of the reckoning, but whoever heard Mr Waldegrave mention such
things, in public or in private? To his way of thinking the new independent
hospital trusts are small versions of the old Morrisonian nationalised
industries, which is why Labour may be disinclined to abolish them if it
wins the election. As to all those Tory-installed computers churning out all
those detailed cost estimates, Labour could only jettison them if it was
insincere in its desire to enable the NHS to win the argument for more
funds.
Meanwhile, the Conservatives struggle to produce a new basic policy
statement, a continuous recycling exercise being beyond their dreams. In
health, they will doubtless draw on the rich seam to be found in Labour's
booklet. Mr Major has already pinched their charter for patients; Mr
Waldegrave is working on a government green paper, due next month, that will
proffer a new 'health strategy'. He has gone back to the Beveridge report,
prepared during the Second World War, to find his guiding principles:
prevention, cure and rehabilitation. It is the merest of coincidences that
these also appear on page five of Labour's 'A fresh start for health'.
As to Mr Clarke, he is undoubtedly in the right job now. Since he became
secretary for education, Labour's traditional lead in that area has begun to
melt away, just as in health. Mr Clarke is not being quite so rumbustious
with the teachers as he was with the doctors. His pronouncements on the need
to simplify the national curriculum and move from complicated 'assessments'
towards easily understood tests are popular with parents. And if he runs out
of ideas there is always Labour's growing bookshelf to rob. But he should be
careful about what he does with what he steals. His bluff, no-nonsense Tory
way of putting education policy could be the winning approach.

FT  16 APR 91 / Pretoria loses its golden parachute: The gold-mining sector,
South Africa's traditional source of succour, is in decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The adage that South Africa has advanced politically by disaster and
economically by windfall has been turned on its head. As the country starts
to rid itself of the political burden of apartheid, a painful recession is
gripping its traditional source of succour - the gold-mining industry.
The industry faces its worst crisis since gold was discovered on the
Witwatersrand more than a century ago. High real interest rates in the main
western economies and the proliferation of new financial instruments to
protect the wealthy against inflation have combined to undermine gold's
safe-haven status. There is increasing concern that recession in the west
will reduce jewellery sales, which account for 60 per cent of gold
consumption. The precious metal has also failed signally to respond to
international political turbulence over the past two years. Forward selling
by producers, including the Soviet Union, has helped hold back any rise in
the price of gold.
Reluctantly, local mining houses have accepted the message - what is bad for
the world is no longer good for South Africa's main export. Gold will not be
coming to the country's rescue. Indeed, the outlook for the industry is
increasingly bleak.
In the past fortnight Gencor and Anglo American, the country's two largest
mining houses, have announced respectively the closure of the Stilfontein
mine and the end of a big exploration programme in the Potchefstroom gap in
western Transvaal.
The latest results from Gold Fields of South Africa (GFSA), another leading
mining house, showed a 7.5 per cent fall in after-tax profits to R219.8m
(Pounds 45.7m) for the first quarter of this year.
Last week Amgold, holding company for Anglo American's gold investments,
announced a 29.2 per cent drop in investment income to R240.7m in the 13
months to March.
Gold is a declining force in the economy. Although it still accounts for 25
per cent of the country's exports, its contribution to gross domestic
product was down to 8.8 per cent in 1990. More revealing is the fall in tax
receipts - from 10.7 per cent of government revenue in 1981-82 to a mere 0.9
per cent in the 1990-91 tax year.
Some observers, including Mr Barend du Plessis, minister of finance, view
the weakening of gold's influence as likely to help develop the rest of the
economy, which they believe has been adversely affected by over-reliance on
the metal.
Yet the implications of the industry's predicament are far-reaching,
particularly in the labour market. Employment in the gold mines has shrunk
from 525,000 in 1987 to 440,000 in 1990. A further 40,000-50,000 jobs are
likely to be shed this year. With the gold price at R933 per ounce (Dollars
343 at yesterday's exchange rate), only 60 per cent of South Africa's gold
would be produced at a profit (if one takes into account capital
expenditure). Yesterday the price, at R979, was not far off that level.
This haemorrhage of jobs from an industry which has offered mass employment
to unskilled workers for decades has powerful social and political
implications in a country with an unemployment rate of about 40 per cent. It
must also be seen against the backdrop of an economy which declined in 1990,
with flat or very modest growth predicted for 1991.
The explanation for the industry's straitened circumstances lies in a simple
cost/price squeeze. Over the past three years, gold has hovered at about
R990 per ounce, while South African inflation has been running at 14 per
cent a year. This means there has been a deterioration in the real rand gold
price of about 36 per cent in three years.
The costs of mining gold have been rising for decades. But in the 1970s, the
industry's worsening financial position was disguised by the rising dollar
price of gold: it rose on average from Dollars 35.75/oz in 1970 to Dollars
612/oz in 1980. During the 1980s, the exchange rate came to the rescue. The
rand/dollar rate rose from 0.78 to 2.59 over the decade, thus helping the
rand gold price to more than double from R477/oz to R992/oz over the same
period.
The chickens came home to roost in the late 1980s. The traditional
relationship between a strong gold price and a strong rand, and vice-versa,
collapsed as the industry faced weaker prices without any compensating fall
in the value of the rand. After peaking at the Dollars 800/oz level in 1980,
gold declined to an average of Dollars 317/oz in 1985. Since then it has
been in the Dollars 350-450/oz band.
The subsequent fall in profits has forced a fundamental shift in the way
gold is mined. In the days of rich ore bodies and a healthy gold price, the
benchmark of achievement was quantitative: how many tonnes of ore a mine
milled. The premise was that however low the grade of ore being mined, it
paid to extract it.
That premise has now changed. A weak gold price has meant that many
lower-grade seams cannot be worked profitably. The focus has thus become
qualitative - what ore can profitably be extracted? Mining houses now focus
on cost per kg gold produced rather than cost per tonne of ore milled.
Activity is focused on the higher-paying parts of a mine. The September
quarter last year was the first time in 14 years that the industry had
raised the average grade of ore mined.
This approach was pioneered by Gengold, the gold arm of the Gencor group.
The effect has been dramatic. In 1988 Gengold's mines produced 89 tonnes of
gold, employing 93,000 people; in the year to June, it expects to produce 81
tonnes of gold with fewer than 60,000 people. The industry's richest mines
are now being managed along these lines.
Mining better grades and shedding labour - which accounts for about half of
a mine's costs - are the most obvious ways of increasing profitability.
Other strategies being employed include:
Switching staff from support jobs, such as administration and finance, to
direct production activities;
Recycling commodities, such as timber, which is used in large quantities for
underground support purposes;
Keener negotiations with suppliers, which are already charging different
prices to different mines for the same goods, depending on the mine's
profitability.
Managers hope this flexibility will extend to wage talks, where there has
been a reluctance on the part of miners' representatives to accept a link
between wages and jobs. Mr Jerry Majatladi, of the National Union of
Mineworkers (NUM), disputes the link, saying it would only apply if the
industry paid higher wages. Unions allege that mine wages for unskilled or
semi-skilled workers are lower than in the manufacturing sector, the reverse
of international patterns. This qualified the extent to which the NUM was
prepared to trim its wage demands, says Mr Majatladi.
Some believe the industry has reached such a sorry state that the government
should move in to help it. Mr Lloyd Pengilly, gold analyst at stockbrokers
Martin and Co, argues that it would be irresponsible for Pretoria to allow a
weak gold price to inflict long-term structural damage on such an important
industry. Others disagree. Mr Mike Tagg, general manager at Gold Fields,
says the state's role should be kept to a minimum. 'If a mine needs funds it
must go to its shareholders or bankers.'
Mr Gary Maude, managing director of Gengold, says that it is self-defeating
for unprofitable mining activities to be subsidised because this encourages
overproduction. In turn, this prevents the price from rising and thus
renders less profitable those mines which could survive without subsidy. He
believes a change of perception 'of the supply of gold as big and growing
and inexhaustible' is essential to boost the price. Mines which cannot
produce profitably must be closed.
A further concern is that while the industry continues to mine about 100m
tonnes of ore a year, exploration expenditure has been cut to the bone. Two
weeks ago Anglo American, the country's largest mining house, decided to
stop prospecting in the north section of the Potchefstroom gap. Comments Mr
Pengilly: 'The growth side of the business has stopped. We're not replacing
the tonnage we're taking out.'
The reason is simply that most of South Africa's better greenfields
prospects are deep, costly and unviable at current prices: in a typical
prospect mining would start at about 3km below surface and cost R3bn to get
into production with a 10-year lead-time before the first bar of gold was
poured. It is unlikely that any such mine will be started in the next decade
unless there is a doubling of the price.
In spite of all the bad news, the industry still has its optimists. Mr
Maxwell notes: 'Inherent in the South African gold mining industry is an
optimism that the gold price will improve.'
For the moment, however, what is dominating attention is 2,000 jobs lost at
Stilfontein. With more closures to come, the government will come under
increasing pressure to intervene as the effects of the industry's troubles
ripple wider.

Rosalind Gilmore, the new building societies commissioner who has just taken
over from Michael Bridgeman, has begun her reign by striking a small blow
against feminist modernism.
Unlike her predecessor who inspired terror in the shires, Mrs Gilmore has
indicated that she favours informality. Even so, at her first commission
meeting it turned out that some ground rules had to be established. 'People
seemed uncertain what I should be called. Was it chair,chairwoman,
chairperson or whatever?' she reports.
Under the Building Societies Act it appears that it has to be chairman, and
that's the way it will be, says Gilmore.

All of a sudden everybody seems to want to visit the European Parliament.
Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, was first on the guest
list for this week's Strasbourg session, dropping in on the president of the
parliament and socialist MEPs. But that did not prevent him being given a
rough ride by some socialists. Jean-Pierre Cot, the socialist leader,
praised him as 'amiable' but sometimes 'over the top, demagogic and
irresponsible'.
Still, at least Yeltsin had space to wander the corridors of the
parliament's Strasbourg home without bumping into other international
celebrities. A couple of days later and he would have been jostling for room
with UN secretary-general Javier Perez de Cuellar (due today), Patricio
Aylwin, Chile's president (scheduled for tomorrow), and an eclectic list of
global statespeople including the Patriarch of Jerusalem, the speaker of the
Swedish parliament, and ex-King Simeon of Bulgaria.
Happily, there is no risk of MEPs losing their sense of perspective on more
important Euro-issues. This week they have also been promised a visit from a
group lobbying on behalf of France's camembert-producers.

Europe's nuclear engineers and scientists could have been happier in the
timing of their hunt for a new symbol to generate public confidence in the
peaceful uses of their technology. The search coincides with a second
international post mortem, being staged in Paris, on the Chernobyl disaster.
What the Swiss-based European Nuclear Society is seeking is a replacement
for the care-worn emblem of electrons whirling round a nucleus, used by the
United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency as well as numerous other
organisations. Ironically, the atom depicted is usually lithium - a metal
with nuclear uses confined to weapons.
Also listed for scrapping, it appears, is the morbid jargon nuclear
scientists once found wryly amusing, instances being criticality, decay,
casket and scram.
Sometimes such jokes have backfired. China syndrome, for instance, was born
when a scientist suggested a reactor-core meltdown in the US midwest might
burn right through the earth and emerge in China. The phrase was borrowed
for the title of a scare film which - when journalists sent to cover the
Three Mile Island emergency were faced with an information blackout -
inspired some alarmingly speculative reports.
While the society is open to ideas for a replacement emblem from all
sources, it already has a suggestion from Soviet nuclear scientists: a
symbol in which the whirling electrons trace a dove.

Instead of having its mind concentrated wonderfully, the Lloyd's community
seems to be bracing itself for impending dire underwriting results with
fin-de-siecle diversions.
For example, diaries are being starred for May 7, the start of the
disciplinary hearing of Ed Cowen, former underwriter of non-marine syndicate
529, at London's Great Eastern Hotel. It is the first such hearing to be
held in public.
Cowen's alleged misdemeanours - the reason for his suspension from Lloyd's
last winter - centre on the arcane world of reinsurance, where the only
testimony that counts is that of expert witnesses. He is claimed to have
gained personal advantage at a level which would hardly have bought a
second-hand BMW.
But there are principles at stake, and Cowen's supporters believe his
defence will - as one put it - 'open a few eyes'. So dark glasses and false
beards may well be the order of the day at the hearing, not only for
spectators, but for some of the witnesses.

More haste, less speed. The celebrations of the lift-off of Jacques Attali's
BERD - the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development - would clearly
have benefited from better preparation, not to mention greater support from
Her Majesty's Government.
For a start, Britain's Overseas Development Administration may be part of
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, but giving it such a big role in the
event has upset some foreign visitors. The ODA knows a lot about the Third
World, but precious little about eastern bloc countries.
Moreover, whose idea was it to site the three-day inauguration on the wrong
side of the river?
It is in the International Maritime Organisation, south of the Thames, with
no parking and no handy underground station. Surely HMG could have pulled
strings and cleared somewhere more convenient, such as the Queen Elizabeth
II Conference Centre by the Houses of Parliament.
Meanwhile, the governor of the Bank of England upset the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales by suddenly dropping out as guest
speaker at last night's annual dinner. Presumably something more important
turned up, such as the chancellor of the Exchequer's dinner for BERD's
board.
As the governor is not the sort of person to snub an important and
long-standing City invitation, it sounds as if the person in charge of
planning the BERD ceremonies should be given the bird.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
During his years with the London Philharmonic Bernard Haitink's Bruckner
performances provided some of the most searching and exhilarating
experiences concert life in the capital could offer. Now, with Haitink a
rare guest on the South Bank, only Gunter Wand's and Klaus Tennstedt's
occasional excursions exhibit anything like the same Brucknerian command.
Meanwhile Haitink's new cycle of the symphonies with the Vienna Philharmonic
has provided evidence of how his interpretations are still deepening, still
maturing, and that was gloriously confirmed in the Festival Hall last night,
by his account of the Seventh with the Dresden Staatskapelle.
The Dresden orchestra is by any standards a priceless asset to a conductor
of a late 19th- century symphony. The sound is so rounded and well
integrated, with fathomless depths of string tone and wind blending into a
seamless chorus, that the music can acquire an effortless patina. The finest
Bruckner performances seem to play themselves, with the minimum of
intervention, and the Staatskapelle's instinctive command of phrase length
and paragraph shape goes a long way towards such an ideal.
With a less eloquent band it's doubtful that Haitink could have successfully
unfolded the first movement at such a leisurely pace, and made so much sense
of its steadily changing perspectives, or built the Adagio into such a
radiant, serene hymn, while still pointing up every detail and expressive
nuance. Even the scherzo never lost the sense of imperious purpose, and
while the finale has other, neglected strands of argument - there is a dark
quality, a Gotterdammerung-like balefulness, that Haitink failed to contact
 -it brought the symphony home in utter certainty, musically and
expressively.
Yet the Staatskapelle has its own idiosyncracies: the vibrato-laden, watery
trumpets are definitely not to British taste, nor would it be everyone's
ideal of a modern Mozart orchestra. Yet Haitink began with the Haffner
Symphony, giving it sprightly, alert rhythms and fining down the string tone
without ever losing the bloom. Even if the wind remained beefy, and the
textures over-succulent, there was no lethargy or soupy phrasing; if big
symphony orchestras have to play the classical repertory with scarcely a nod
to the discoveries of period performance then this was certainly one viable
approach.

FT  16 APR 91 / Arts: A modern genius cut off after his prime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seurat, the major exhibition that now occupies the Grand Palais in Paris
(until August 12, then to New York: sponsored in Paris by Aerospatiale and
IBM), continues the programme the Reunion des musees nationaux has sustained
now over rather more than a decade, of the definitive celebration of the
great figures of French art. With Georges Seurat the prospect is especially
enticing, for he was hardly the most prolific of painters and here would
seem to be our chance to see him clearly and see him whole. In thus
presenting his essential achievement, the event is no disappointment, but
while it confirms his central importance as an artist it leaves the nature
of that achievement, if anything, more ambiguous than before.
Along with Van Gogh, Schiele and Modigliani, all of them lately the subject
of major individual studies, we again have a case of the artist cut off
prematurely and in his prime. The only difference is that with Seurat the
cruel and unworthy thought lingers on, not of genius frustrated and promise
unfulfilled, but rather of the great work over and in a real sense complete.
We find it, moreover, rounded off by a palpable change of direction and real
shift in sensibility. Who can say what would have come of it, but as it
stands in the last Circus paintings, it signifies only a decline towards the
mannered and the decorative, the over-theoretical and technically suspect.
After the magisterial monumentality of all that had gone before, culminating
in the Poseuses of 1888, and the associated studies, the contrast afforded
by latest Seurat could not be more poignant.
Born in 1859, he died early in 1891, it is thought of a diptheria, barely
nine months after Van Gogh's suicide, who was by some six years his senior
and whom he knew. The careers of the two men marched thus somewhat together,
though it was Seurat's that was the more orthodox in its origins, began
earlier and was to prosper, comparatively, in his lifetime. It is
astonishing here to recognise quite how quickly he came to his full maturity
as an artist. He began his studies at the Atelier Lequien in 1876, going on
to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in 1878. Here among the drawings that represent
those beginnings are two academic studies of the male nude, standing,
full-length, both cast in a strong light, in which the abstracted
simplicities of the later drawings are already immanent. Une baignade,
Asnieres, the huge composition now at the National Gallery in London, was
completed in 1884, when Seurat was all of 25, Un dimanche a la Grande Jatte,
similarly huge and now at the Art Institute of Chicago, only two years
later.
Both paintings are present only in full-size reproduction in
black-and-white, as is the Poseuses in the Barnes Foundation at
Philadelphia, which is an undoubted pity. Opportunity missed, however,
serves to place a full and necessary emphasis on the preparatory material,
of which an extraordinary amount has been brought together. And it is the
relation in which this mass of drawings, studies and sketches stands to the
finished works, with all their overt formal control and technical
considerations, that is the heart of the matter, and the key to Seurat.
He was never simply an artist responsive to the external, visible world. In
a sense no artist ever is, for everything must be ordered, simplified, and
to an extent rendered through a system - vide the impressionists
quasi-scientific concern with light and its effects. But Seurat was always
also a moralist, and it is important in this connection to remember the
central importance of symbolism, so long disregarded by our later reading of
modern art, to Seurat's own generation of modern artists. The first room of
drawings, and a number of studies, all of the early 1880s, make clear the
positive interest he took in the work of Millet and Puvis de Chavannes, a
conscious influence he shared with Van Gogh.
But the sheer painterliness of impressionism he evidently found
irresistible, with its clear, clean colour, the rich, fat paint and the mark
free and open upon the surface. How was one to reconcile such hedonism to
more serious purpose? His first answer was to abstract and simplify, always
searching out the essential horizontal and vertical in the image, always
presenting it repetitively, formal and frontal, as though to keep his
distance. No particular is celebrated for itself but only in that it should
serve the grand design. There would be no seeking to fix the petit sensation
of the cornfield or the river-bank sur le motif, like Cezanne, for him. No
wonder that the artists of the Independants, with whom he showed the
Baignade in 1885, should be disconcerted by what seemed so blatant a shift
of principle and practice. Theory mattered, and with the Baignade,
pointillist neo-impressionism had arrived. Gauguin and Van Gogh, Cezanne and
Seurat, so we were always taught, were together the four pillars of
post-impressionism: how interesting that Seurat, the youngest, should be the
first. The Fauves are coming to London later in the summer, and how useful
it is to see Seurat now, a sort of fauve avant la lettre, in relation to
early Matisse and Derain.
What is more fascinating, however, is to see the degree to which, in these
smaller works, Seurat remained so much the instinctive painter still, even
while consulting his larger formal interests. The tiny studies he made along
the Seine through the middle 80s, those for la Grande Jatte especially,
despite the repetitive, systematic simplicity by which they can be slotted
in to their place in the great composition, are among the most perfect,
direct and unaffected examples of high impressionism. The light shimmers
across the water; a girl sits sewing beneath the trees; other figures stand
Marienbad-like, anchored to their shadows, bustle and parasol in strong
silhouette; we almost smell the sun on warm earth and grass.

FT  16 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour steps up attack on
Conservative discord: Local Elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR WENT on the offensive in the local election campaigns yesterday,
repeating its accusations of Tory discord and dithering.
The attack, which precedes publication today of Labour's updated policy
document, came as Tory officials condemned as 'character assassination' a
BBC television programme delving into Mr John Major's past. Yesterday's
Panorama raised questions on the prime minister's sensitivity about his
schooling, and the technical validity of his election for the first time as
a councillor in south London.
Tory unhappiness about the programme's concentration on Mr Major's
personality rather than his policies follows a Sunday interview which was
said to have 'frustrated' the prime minister because of its focus on a
narrow range of issues.
Mr John Cunningham, Labour's campaign co-ordinator, claimed that the Tories'
disarray had led them to cancel local election press conferences, silencing
even Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman. Tory central office said that
no press conferences had been cancelled because none had been planned for
this week. 'When we have something to say, we'll say it.'
The green paper on the replacement for the poll tax is most likely to be
published next week, but could still come on Thursday, after cabinet
approval.
The cabinet committee dealing with it is due to meet today in what could be
a long discussion on the details of the draft. The preference for a property
tax based on a two-adult household, with discounts for single-person
households, has been substantially agreed and will be spelt out firmly.
Today's launch of 'Labour's better way for the 1990s', will not include
further details of the party's plans to replace the poll tax, re-stated at
last week's launch of the local election campaigns, but will update and
expand from last year's policy document areas such as the economy and
foreign affairs.
Labour's document was yesterday approved without substantial changes by the
party's national executive committee.
In his introduction to the document, Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader,
describes Britain as a country with great potential 'being pushed into
decline' after 12 years of Tory rule. He claims that while the Tories have
no way of governing other than repeating their mistakes, Labour would
provide government which is 'accountable, not arrogant; enabling, not
meddling'.
The Liberal Democrats will today give detailed figures for their local
income tax.

FT  16 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Backbenchers bring mixed messages -
The mood among Tory MPs returning from holiday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is one of the more enduring myths at Westminster that Tory MPs see
parliamentary recesses as a never-to-be-missed opportunity to test the
political mood in their constituencies.
In reality, most on the government benches studiously avoid living in the
areas they represent. The tanned Tory faces in the lobbies yesterday
attested to the widespread preference for a break spent relaxing in the sun
over one opening spring fetes or sipping medium dry white wine at
fund-raising buffets.
There are of course honourable exceptions; and the local elections on May 2
meant that most if not all had to put in at least a token spell on the
political stump. The message they brought back for an embattled Mr John
Major yesterday was, to coin a phrase, indecisive.
Most were surprised that what was to have been a peaceful interlude over
Easter had turned into a media inquest on whether Mr Major can make the
grade in Downing Street. Most were frankly fed up with the party's
continuing internecine strife about the replacement for the poll tax.
But they were also uncertain about whether a party which has spent most of
the past two years shooting itself in the foot is now prepared to direct its
fire towards the Labour opposition.
From a few of the disgruntled and dispossessed on the Thatcherite right came
a warning that they are far from certain that her legacy is safe in Mr
Major's hands. Some close to the former prime minister said she remains
loyal to her successor but is anguished, and sometimes disparaging, about
some recent decisions.
Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, and Mr David Mellor, the chief
secretary to the Treasury, found themselves the recipients of some less than
flattering comments about their 'centralist' intentions from a former
cabinet colleague.
Two weeks away from Westminster has lowered the political temperature among
Tories. Another cut in mortgage rates and the promise of more to come has
provided the long-awaited glimpse of light on the economic front. Most hope
an announcement in the next few days on the poll tax replacement will take
at least some of the sting out of that issue.
Mr David Martin, whose tiny majority of 205 in Portsmouth South makes him
one of his party's more assiduous canvassers, insists that the sniping at
the prime minister heard among London's chattering classes is not echoed on
the doorsteps. ''Give the prime minister a chance' is the message I have
been getting from the ordinary voter,' he says. 'They saw that the community
charge destroyed Mrs Thatcher and they are very pleased that John Major is
tackling it'.
Mr Nicholas Budgen, the eclectic Tory MP for Wolverhampton South West, is
not known to be among the most fervent admirers of the new regime. But he
too admits that the announcement of a Pounds 140 cut in poll tax bills means
there is 'surprisingly little' concern about the issue on the doorsteps.
Others echo the views of Mr Norman Tebbit, the former party chairman who
retains close links with Mr Major's Downing Street. Labour, he believes,
cannot win the general election on its own merits, but the Conservatives
could lose it if they become distracted by internal bickering.
Mr Graham Riddick, who represents the marginal Colne Valley, puts it
crisply: 'The thing that strikes me is that no-one actually wants a Labour
government. Once we have fully got our act together we will get re-elected.'
Not all are so upbeat. Sir Rhodes Boyson, a vocal opponent of a return to a
property-based system of local taxation, warns that the decision to abandon
the poll tax must not be at the expense of his Brent North constituents.
They, and voters in dozens of similar suburban seats around London, did well
out of the poll tax.
Sir Rhodes is in a minority. The problem for the Tories is that the economic
recession and the question mark over Mr Major, underscored again last night
by BBC Television's Panorama programme, amplify the discordant notes.
There is little evidence that the prime minister is a ditherer, but he
should know more than most that in politics perceptions are often more
important than reality.

FT  16 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Schoolmasterly approach to
encouraging exporters - Ralph Atkins talks to trade minister Tim Sainsbury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF CONSERVATIVES are more concerned about export promotion under Mr John
Major, the difference is in emphasis rather than substance of policy - at
least if Mr Tim Sainsbury, minister for trade, is the guide.
His list of priorities for promoting exports is headed by the breaking down
of international trade barriers and the creation of the right framework for
traders worldwide. Any Thatcherite would agree eagerly.
It is a free market strategy in keeping with the Department of Trade and
Industry's reputation as the driest in Whitehall. From Mr Sainsbury that is
something of a revelation. Out of the five DTI ministers, he is part of the
minority of two who are not members of the deeply-Thatcherite No Turning
Back Group.
His early political experience was in the shadow of Mr Michael Heseltine,
now environment secretary, and regarded as more of an interventionist than
most in the Cabinet. Mr Sainsbury was his unpaid parliamentary private
secretary for four years in the early 1980s, before coming to the DTI via
junior ministerial jobs at the Ministry of Defence and Foreign Office.
In piloting through parliament the bill to privatise part of the Export
Credit Guarantee Department, however, Mr Sainsbury has displayed little
willingness to appease those anxious for a more pro-active export strategy.
Removing much of the ECGD from the state sector is in keeping with his
vision of government as an 'enabler'.
Aged 58, he is not a high-profile politician. He is careful and thorough in
his choice of words; he could never be accused of indiscretion. At times he
has the air of a schoolmaster, more at home on the DTI's cream ministerial
settees than on the green Commons benches.
In his office, he fondly explains ECGD privatisation in terms of a company
selling widgets, wrapping his mouth around the word 'widgets' as if it was a
boiled sweet. Officials find he quotes Sainsbury's repeatedly when searching
for examples of business practice.
Mr Sainsbury prefers the life of a minister to that of a businessman. It is
a vocation rather than a job; his wealth almost certainly putting him in the
category of multi-millionaire. The Sunday Times recently estimated the
Sainsbury family's fortune at Pounds 1.85bn. He gave up executive
responsibility at the supermarket group in 1974.
But, ask him exactly how rich he is and he bristles: 'I have never disguised
the fact that I have a substantial personal equity stake in J. Sainsbury and
it has been a very successful company.'
In practice, much of the headline-grabbing work of the minister for exports
has been dominated by Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary.
During his first eight months in the job, Mr Sainsbury admits there has been
'a lot of activity' on the international scene in attempting to break down
trade barriers.
'Before you can actually start selling anything you have got to have a
framework in which you can do it,' he says.
Only after that does he believe a trade minister should turn to looking at
the effective use of government resources and staff - including his own role
as a salesman.
Recently Mr Sainsbury announced the setting up of Overseas Trade Services, a
joint body spanning the DTI and the Foreign Office. On top of that is the
British Overseas Trade Board, within the DTI, comprising 180 businessmen who
advise the government.
The BOTB's forward plan, launched last month, says priorities for export
promotion should remain western Europe, Japan, the Pacific Rim nations and
North America. Small and medium-sized companies in particular are to be
encouraged to tackle export markets.
Mr Sainsbury denies there is duplication between the BOTB and the joint
directorate. 'The first advice you want about the priorities is from the
practitioners of the art. That's where the BOTB come in.'
In the areas of 'the direct working with exporters', the government runs
multifarious schemes offering advice and assistance.
He travels to get businessmen access to foreign governments and raise the
profile of British business. But he is adamant that exporting is only
something companies can do. 'The message you are trying to get across is
that exporting is not as difficult as you think it is, if you haven't tried
it.'

FT  16 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Exports bill provision deleted -
ECGD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT assurances that exporters had nothing to fear from the absence of
a specific statutory commitment to maintain a reinsurance facility covering
exports to areas of political risk were questioned from both sides of the
Commons last night.
Ms Joyce Quin, from the Labour front bench, said 'nothing less than a
statutory commitment' in the Export and Investment Guarantees Bill would be
acceptable to industry.
The bill was given a third reading by a majority of 87 (281-194) and now
goes to the Lords.
A claim by Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, that it was impossible to frame
a provision to satisfy the needs of commercial interests without exposing
the government to unacceptable risks was also challenged by Mr Robert
McCrindle (C Brentwood and Ongar). A parliamentary consultant to the British
Insurance Brokers Association, Mr McCrindle urged the government to give the
issue further consideration with a view to introducing an amendment in the
Lords.
Ms Quin appealed to independently minded Conservative peers to take account
of the views of industry and to join the opposition in seeking to remedy the
bill's defects.
Mr Sainsbury successfully called for the deletion from the bill of a
provision intended to ensure the continuance of a reinsurance facility for
areas of political risk when elements of the Export Credits Guarantee
Department are privatised. The provision - defeated by 97 votes (285-188) -
was inserted on a government defeat during its committee stage.
Mr Sainsbury argued that MPs and business organisations supporting the
inclusion of such a provision had failed to appreciate the safeguards which
the government had already agreed to put in place.
He stressed that the part of the ECGD remaining in state control would
provide support to supplement the reinsurance which the privatised company
would secure in the private market. This would be a temporary facility
available for up to three years after privatisation.

The government proposes to tighten regulations to distinguish between

Parents would then be able to compare truancy rates when choosing a school.
He also proposed a rise in fines for non-attendance from Pounds 400 to

FT  16 APR 91 / Testing time for teachers and pupils: Assessments begin for
seven-year-olds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week and next, seven-year-olds in maintained schools in England and
Wales will sit standard assessment tasks (Sats), and will face tests again
when aged 11 and 14.
National testing at those three ages was among the most controversial
aspects of Mr Kenneth Baker's Education Reform Act of 1988, and until last
week the National Union of Teachers seemed poised to boycott their
introduction. Now that support for a boycott appears to have collapsed, Sats
will soon be part of the primary school routine.
Formal pupil assessment of some kind is here to stay, whoever is in power.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's education spokesman, inveighs against the complexity
of Sats, but says: 'There is clearly a role for formal assessment and
testing. It benefits parents, schools and teachers themselves.'
Many educationalists agree. 'In the past we have been far too sloppy about
assessment,' says Professor Peter Mortimore, deputy director of London
University's Institute of Education. 'The new Sats are a great advance on
the old pencil-and-paper tests, and when shorn of the razzmatazz should help
teachers identify and develop the potential of their pupils better than they
do now.'
The complexity of the tests, already a dilution of last year's pilots, is
causing anxiety. Primary school teachers spent much of last term making
their own assessments against 32 attainment targets (mostly in maths and
science). This term they must administer formal Sats to meet nine targets.
notes to teachers on administering Sats runs to 200 pages, and the record
sheets for each seven-year-old look like income tax forms.
Mrs Sue Siefert, head of the 450-pupil Thornhill Primary School, in the
inner London Borough of Islington, points to a stack of Department of
Education and Science booklets received in the past month and says:
'Assessment has become the master, not the servant, of our trade. We are
spending two terms assessing the kids' output when we should have been
teaching.'
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, has pledged to review the tests
to meet some of the teachers' concerns. What remains is a pervasive
atmosphere of mistrust.
In Scotland, well over half of all pupils take no part in compulsory primary
school testing, so great is opposition from parents and teachers alike.
'You can't teach without assessment,' Mrs Siefert says. 'But Sats are
nothing to do with children: they're to do with testing teachers and
schools. Tests will be published, schools labelled, and the back door open
to selection.' Ministers deny the last two charges, although tests may be
published in future.
Last week Mr Clarke instructed the Council for the Accreditation of Teacher
Education to conduct an urgent inquiry into the preparation of teachers to
teach reading.
Whether reading standards have really declined is disputed within the
teaching profession. Mr Colin Harrison, president of the United Kingdom
Reading Association, dismisses claims for decline as statistical gibberish.
'To suggest that teachers have totally abandoned tried and trusted methods
is facile,' he writes in the latest issue of the association's journal, 'and
to suggest that this has resulted in almost immediate national decline is to
misunderstand the nature of curriculum development and change.'
Here again, differences between Mr Clarke and the education establishment
are more apparent than real. Recent research by Professor Mortimore and Dr
Pam Sammons, a researcher at the institute, led them to conclude: 'Much of
the variation between primary schools can be accounted for by differences in
school policies and practices within the control of the principal and
teachers.'
Variations in the social background of pupils were found to be of much less
significance.
Among the leading factors they identify to explain disparities between
schools are: purposeful leadership of staff by the head teacher; consistency
among teachers; effective record-keeping; structured lessons; and parental
involvement. The researchers say: 'Where all teachers follow guidelines in
the same way, the impact on students' progress is positive. Variations among
teachers in their use of guidelines has a negative effect.'
Mr Clarke could not have put it better himself.

FT  16 APR 91 / Paper urges replacement for A-levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPLACING A-levels with a more broadly based post-16 qualification is likely
to be advocated by the Labour party in a policy document to be released
later this month.
An education working party chaired by Mr Derek Fatchett, a Labour education
spokesman, is examining alternatives to A-levels for pupils in England and
Wales. A modular course with a mixture of academic and vocational subjects
is the favoured option.
'We need to integrate the academic and the vocational side of post-16
study,' Mr Fatchett said yesterday. 'But if you go for two separate
qualifications, the traditional A-level will always rank in the first
division, and its vocational equivalent in the second division.'
One option under consideration is a baccalaureat based loosely on the French
system, as advocated by the pro-Labour Institute of Public Policy Research.
Pupils would study a minimum of five 'modular courses', with at least one
arts subject, one social science and one natural science.
Ministers have ruled out abolition of the A-level, which they regard as the
'gold standard' of the post-16 system. They appear to favour the creation of
a separate vocational qualification to run in tandem with it.

FT  16 APR 91 / Slide in truck sales is worst since 1945
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL vehicle manufacturers and importers say they are experiencing the
worst UK sales collapse since the Second World War.
There is a growing consensus that in spite of falling interest rates there
is little prospect of a significant upturn before 1992, particularly in the
worst affected sector of heavy trucks.
Statistics released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show
that March offered no relief, with overall commercial vehicle sales down
29.14 per cent, to 22,706 from 32,043, compared with the same month a year
ago, and sales of trucks over 3.5 tonnes down 35.4 per cent.
More alarming yet for truck makers is that the nearly 38 per cent drop in
truck sales over the first quarter of this year compared with the same
period of 1990 follows a 25 per cent fall in the 1990 quarter compared with
the same period of 1989. That means that sales are only half the level of
two years ago.
Mr Peter Foden, chairman of Cheshire-based truck maker ERF, commented:
'Heaven only knows how some manufacturers are surviving.'
ERF itself barely survived the previous truck market downturn of the early
1980s, when sales of trucks over 3.5 tonnes fell to 44,000 from a high of
nearly 80,000.
Although sales in the sector are running at an even lower annualised rate -
36,000 - ERF and the UK's other independent truck maker, AWD, have so far
been able to avoid further retrenchment because of orders for several
thousand trucks from the Zimbabwe government.
The latest SMMT statistics provide a sombre background for the launch of the
EuroCargo, the first important heavy truck to be announced by Fiat's Iveco
commercial vehicles subsidiary and Iveco Ford, a UK-based joint venture
company with Ford.
Speaking at Eurocargo's launch in Brescia, Italy, this week Mr Gioancarlo
Boschetti, Iveco's chief executive, warned that the UK downturn - 'the
traditional indicator of a crisis' - is starting to affect all other leading
European markets.

FT  16 APR 91 / Labour puts emphasis on nurseries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LABOUR government would switch Pounds 50m a year from the spending
programmes of City Technology Colleges to fund expansion of nursery
education, the party said yesterday.
The party has invited local authorities to submit outline plans for
increasing nursery education in their areas. Mr Jack Straw, shadow education
secretary, said: 'There is no time to waste in creating these
opportunities.'
Labour's proposals allow the party to back its pledge to increase nursery
provision, with a specific spending commitment without having to promise an
increase in overall spending. It says total spending on education would
depend on decisions that can be made only when the party is in office.
Labour has said it would provide a nursery place for every child aged three
or four whose parents want one. The Pounds 50m a year allocated for capital
spending by City Technology Colleges could fund 20,000 new part-time nursery
places, the party calculates.
Mr Straw attacked the CTCs as 'extremely wasteful'. Capital spending on CTCs
was 80 times that for local authority schools and they had failed to attract
the business sponsorship the government had predicted. Pupils at existing
CTCs would not be affected.

FT  16 APR 91 / First fraud case data published by SIB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECURITIES and Investments Board, the financial services regulatory
body, has carried out more than 600 investigations since it was created
three years ago, it disclosed yesterday. Of those, four have led to
convictions.
Twenty cases of unauthorised trading involving several million pounds of
investors' money are at various stages of investigation or trial. Two more
cases are to be tried this year.
The SIB's first reported statistics since its was set up in 1988 showed the
state of breaches of Section Four of the 1986 Financial Services Act which
requires anyone carrying out investment business to be authorised by the
SIB.
'We think we have acted promptly after notification of possible frauds,'
said Mr Jeff Thomas, deputy director of the enforcement division. 'But
clearly there is a lot of fraud not yet detected.'
Six individuals have been convicted and imprisoned as a result of
investigations headed by the SIB since August 1988.

FT  16 APR 91 / Wakeham sees thriving electricity competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA and JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPETITION in electricity generation will develop in spite of an increase
in gas prices, Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, said yesterday.
Fears that the recent 35 per cent increase in British Gas prices for new
contracts to supply power stations would crush the independent stations
planned in the UK were unfounded, Mr Wakeham told an Economist conference on
electricity in London. The increase was a short-term matter, he said, and
longer-term gas reserves in the North Sea were plentiful.
Competition in gas supply was emerging and no fundamental change in the gas
industry's regulatory regime was necessary. Although British Gas had
challenged an order freezing the 35 per cent price increase, issued by gas
industry regulator Mr James McKinnon, Mr Wakeham said that the challenge had
been agreed with the regulator and was intended by British Gas to allow
further talks with power companies. Four power station projects had struck
deals with other gas producers, and more were likely.
Regulation was promoting competition in both the gas and the electricity
industries, Mr Wakeham said. For example, domestic electricity customers had
important new rights, such as compensation for power failures, and domestic
gas customers had seen prices fall since the privatisation of gas in 1986.
Regulation should, he believed, ultimately wither away. 'Enough progress has
already been made in this area to throw into considerable doubt the
contention that privatisation has simply swapped state ownership for state
regulation,' he said.
Speaking at the same conference, Professor Stephen Littlechild,
director-general of Offer, the regulatory body, said the new electricity
market was working well but some changes were still needed.
He said he would review charges imposed by the National Grid Company on
suppliers and users of electricity. Those ignore the fact that it is more
costly to transmit electricity across the country, and do not use prices to
indicate to generators and users at which locations it would be most
economic for them to join the grid. He also said that more sophisticated
meters would be necessary if small customers were to have the opportunity to
take electricity from outside their area.
The General Electric Company of the UK is to build a Pounds 90m combined
heat and power station to provide steam and electricity for British Nuclear
Fuels' Sellafield site in Cumbria.
THE GOVERNMENT was criticised yesterday for relaxing standards to be applied
to pollution from power stations under the new Environmental Protection Act,
writes John Hunt. The latest guidance on emissions of nitrogen oxides
specifies a ceiling of 650mg per cubic meters from solid fuels at power
stations - a relaxation from the 400mg proposed earlier. The DoE emphasised
that these levels are kept under review and could be raised later as
abatement technology improves.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental organisation, complained that the
relaxation had been allowed in order to help the newly privatised
electricity supply industry. It threatened a court challenge to the
Pollution Inspectorate's interpretation of the act.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Trade union membership down sharply in
1989
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE UNION membership fell in 1989 by the largest amount for several years,
according to the latest independent figures, published today.
The Certification Officer's annual report for 1990 shows an overall drop in
membership of nearly 344,000 during 1989. That is greater than had
previously been thought: the Trades Union Congress put the drop for the year
at about 235,000 out of a total membership of about 8.4m. However, those
figures take account only of TUC-affiliated unions. The Certification
Officer puts total union membership at about 10m.
Union membership has suffered principally because of the decline of
traditional manufacturing industries and the growth of the non-unionised
service sector.  The TUC said yesterday that it faced difficulties in
keeping pace with changes in the labour market.
The Certification Officer who has a statutory responsibility for supervising
unions' political funds, membership figures and accounts also reported that
the use of government funds for secret postal ballots doubled over the past
year to pounds 2.6m : 85 unions applied for funding for 680 ballots,
compared with 67 unions claiming for 483 ballots in 1989.

FT  16 APR 91 / Blue Arrow Trial: Share purchase decided at high level, jury
told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PURCHASE of 4.5 per cent of Blue Arrow shares in the 1987 rights issue
by County NatWest Securities was sanctioned by senior management of County
NatWest, its merchant banking co-subsidiary, not CNWS itself, the Blue Arrow
trial was told yesterday.
Mr Mark Potashnick, CNWS former acting head of market making and a
prosecution witness, said he had first learnt CNWS was taking the holding
the day after the issue. It was made clear that it would be under the 5 per
cent level requiring disclosure. He said he had accepted, rather than agreed
to, the decision.
'I do not feel that the responsibility lay on my shoulders,' he said. 'I had
always seen this as a group holding which had been acquired on the back of a
very, very senior management decision.'
He had no knowledge of County or Phillips and Drew, the brokers to the
issue, taking further holdings, he told Mr Nicholas Purnell, QC,
prosecuting.
County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips and Drew Securities
and seven individuals deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the result
of the Pounds 837m issue.
Mr Alun Jones, QC, for Mr Stephen Clark, a County director and one of the
defendants, asked Mr Potashnick whether he felt deceived and misled when
County disclosed in December 1987 that it owned 9.5 per cent of Blue Arrow.
Mr Potashnick replied: 'That may have been the case later on. My immediate
reaction was shock that, having been so careful about the 5 per cent level,
the holding was much larger than that.'
He felt the announcement that CNWS had bought the shares reflected badly on
his judgment. He was also upset when a press report named him and Mr Philip
Rimell, then CNWS chairman, as having driven the deal. He expressed his
concern to Mr David Reed, a former County director and another defendant,
At a farewell drink when Mr Potashnick left CNWS, Mr Nicholas Wells, a
former County director and another defendant, had told him nobody had ever
made him buy the shares.
'I begged to differ,' he said.
The trial continues today.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Threat by Scots TUC over training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST extensive union boycott of the government's employer-led training
framework was in prospect yesterday when unions threatened to withdraw
co-operation with training bodies in Scotland unless they were given a
greater say in running them.
The vote at the Scottish Trades Union Congress indicated that the Labour
party might face conflict with unions about representation on Training and
Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in England and Wales, and Local Enterprise
Companies (Lecs) in Scotland.
A boycott of Lecs, and of the two training umbrella bodies, Scottish
Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, would involve the first
clash between the government and unions about training since the abolition
of the Manpower Services Commission in 1988.
The tripartite MSC was abolished by Sir Norman Fowler, the former employment
secretary, after unions failed to co-operate fully with the introduction of
the government's Employment Training (ET) scheme for unemployed adults.
Sir Norman followed up the abolition of the MSC by setting up the 82 Tecs
and 22 Lecs.
A majority of members of both Tec and Lec boards are private-sector chief
executives, and no representation is automatically guaranteed to unions.
The STUC in Dundee passed a resolution calling for Lecs to be made 'more
democratic and accountable' and saying that, if union representation was not
improved within a year, a proposal to boycott the framework should be drawn
up.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of the Nalgo public-service union, said
that only four Lecs had accepted an STUC nominee. 'The sad, short history of
this affair has amounted to a hefty kick in the teeth for the Scottish trade
union movement,' he said.
Mr Jinkinson said that he hoped Labour would keep Tecs and Lecs 'in name
alone'.
He said that unions should be demanding that 'as social partners, employers
and trade unions are treated equally and Lecs are accountable to local
needs'.
Labour has said that it wants to keep the Lecs and the Lec framework, but Mr
Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, has not defined whether unions
would be given a statutory right to membership of the boards.
STUC leaders yesterday appeared to have avoided a debate on union
representation on company boards by excluding a reference to the subject
from a motion on the Scottish economy for debate tomorrow.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): TGWU leadership contender alleges
'gagging'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORTERS of Mr Bill Morris, deputy general secretary of the Transport and
General Workers' Union, yesterday claimed that his campaign for the
leadership of the union was being hindered by local TGWU officials who did
not want him elected.
They said several campaign meetings and visits to companies had been
cancelled after interventions by local officials.
The claim is the latest development in the increasingly acrimonious contest
between Mr Morris and Mr George Wright, the two rivals to succeed Mr Ron
Todd. Mr Morris said that senior officials and lay members of his union were
trying to 'gag' him to damage his campaign. 'I will not be gagged,' he
declared. 'I have got a message and I am not going to be stopped from
delivering it.'
Supporters of Mr Wright, the Wales regional secretary, cast doubt on the
significance of the incidents. They emphasised that Mr Wright had no
involvement in restricting Mr Morris's campaign.
Regional secretaries in nine of the TGWU's 11 regions have offered support
to Mr Wright. Leaders of Mr Morris's campaign have been concerned that
regional officials sympathetic to his rival might hinder the campaign in
their areas.
Mr Morris's supporters said that interventions by local officials had led to
two company visits' being cancelled in the past two weeks. He had also been
prevented from speaking in the Neath by-election in support of Mr Peter
Hain, Labour's successful candidate in the recent Neath by-election. They
said a visit to a Walker's Crisps factory in Leicester had been cancelled by
a district official on the ground that he had a dispute with the company.
Shop stewards at the company had told Mr Morris they knew of no such
dispute.
Backers of Mr Morris also said that a planned visit to Esso Chemicals
refinery at Fawley, near Southampton, had been postponed by the company on
the ground that no senior manager was available to meet him.

FT  16 APR 91 / Think tank calls for government homes bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE establishment of a government-sponsored investment bank to raise finance
for council, housing-association and private landlords is proposed in a
report published today by the Institute for Public Policy Research.
It also recommends that mortgage tax relief be phased out on new home loans.
That would not affect existing home loans, it says.
The report from the left-of-centre think tank proposes a two-tier private
rented market. One would be an unregulated sector where landlords would be
permitted to charge market rents but would receive no public subisidies.
Tenants would be ineligible for housing benefit.
In the other, regulated sector, landlords would not pay tax on rental income
and would qualify for housing improvement grants. In return, rents would be
fixed and tenants would be entitled to security of tenure, says Mr Stephen
Merrett, the report's author and reader in housing studies at University
College London.
Mr Merrett said a Housing Investment Bank would raise funds wholesale from
international money markets and would not require Treasury finance.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): CBI warns over public sector pay
increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT policies that allow a form of pay comparability between the
private and public sectors were attacked yesterday as 'mindless indexation'
by the Confederation of British Industry.
Mr John Banham, CBI director-general, made the charge as he warned that
public-sector pay was rising too fast and threatening 'essential further
cuts in interest rates needed to get the economy moving again'.
His comments came four days after the government offered more than 300,000
civil servants pay rises of between 7.6 per cent and 7.8 per cent under
formulae linking public-sector rises to those at private companies.
Mr Banham, speaking at London's Guildhall, said the private-sector employers
had responded in pay negotiations to Britain's entry into the exchange rate
mechanism, higher unemployment and inflation.
Pay determination in the public sector had yet to respond to the changes.
Public-sector pay settlements in the financial year April 1991 to March
1992, when inflation is likely to be less than 5 per cent, according to the
CBI, would be based on considerably higher inflation figures for the
previous year.
'Such mindless indexation amounts to accommodation with the enemy,
inflation, which is costing business some Pounds 5bn a point,' said Mr
Banham. 'The watchwords for pay negotiators are plain: no performance, no
pay increase.'
The six unions representing the 23,000 manual workers at ICI asked yesterday
in their annual pay negotiations for a 'substantial increase', Lisa Wood
writes. ICI will respond on May 20.
The Chemical Industries Association which negotiates on behalf of other
companies in the sector, employing more than 20,000 process workers, has
offered a 5.17 per cent increase on the basic chemical industry rate.
The offer has been rejected and unions and management will meet again on
April 26. The association said the main gulf between the two was over the
unions' demand for a reduced working week - at present 38 hours.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Women in NHS seen to be at a
disadvantage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARIA MAGUIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN IN the National Health Service lack the same access to training as men
because of caring responsibilities, according to Mr Eric Caines, director of
personnel management for the NHS and a member of the NHS management
executive.
Mr Caines, speaking at a conference organised by the Department of Health,
based his comment on the results of a recent survey among NHS employees on
how staff combine their jobs with the responsibilities of caring for
children and the elderly.
The survey found that 54 per cent of staff with child care responsibilities
found it hard to attend training courses and 59 per cent had difficulties
with child care in the past year. Fifty-nine per cent felt it would be
difficult to take time off in a crisis and 41 per cent thought their
promotional prospects had suffered.
Mr Caines said the survey showed that it was 'more acceptable to be ill than
to be a mother' and that attitudinal changes were needed.  Managers would
have to devise more flexible policies towards career planning and develop
strategies to deal with changing employment patterns bringing more women
into the work-force.
He said employees carers were saving the NHS money and should be supported.

HIGH-PERFORMANCE Ford cars are up to ten times as likely to be stolen as
Nissans or Volvos, according to a 'car theft index' published by the Home
Office yesterday at the start of National Crime Prevention Week, John
Griffiths writes.
Home Office officials are to meet vehicle manufacturers later this week to
discuss ways of improving security. They said that high susceptibility to
theft reflected a car's attractiveness and popularity as well as the ease
with which it could be stolen. Statistics showed that 494,000 cars were
recorded stolen last year.
The thefts accounted for 11 per cent of all recorded crime, Mr Kenneth
Baker, the home secretary, said. He added that three quarters of people
questioned in a survey would have been willing to pay more for built-in
security features on cars.

FT  16 APR 91 / TV bidder plans to make few programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE David Frost and Richard Branson consortium that is preparing bids for
two leading commercial television franchises in south-east England plans to
make very few programmes.
The CPV-TV consortium, which will almost certainly bid for the franchises
held by Thames Television and TVS Entertainment, would act mainly as a
publisher rather than a producer, commissioning nearly all of its programmes
apart from regional news.
It has not yet decided which franchise will be its first preference
CPV-TV, which includes Charterhouse, the merchant bank, would have a very
small central staff and only one studio for its regional programming. Thames
Television has a production staff of 1,500 and six studios.
If the consortium wins Thames's weekday London franchise, a significant loss
of jobs at Thames, the largest ITV company, would be inevitable.
Other jobs would, however, be created in the independent production sector.
Mr John Gau, a former chairman of the Independent Programme Producers
Association, who will be director of programmes at CPV-TV, is believed to
have lined up several leading independent television producers.
The cost structure of such a bid would be lower than that of a company such
as Thames, with its large commitment to producing programmes for the
national network.
TV-AM, THE breakfast television company, plans to explore links with Sky
News, the 24-hour satellite news channel, when the current franchise bids
finish.
Talks have already taken place between Mr Bruce Gyngell, TV-am managing
director, and Mr Sam Chisholm, managing director of British Sky
Broadcasting, on potential co-operation.
Both see opportunities for economies of scale in their UK television news
operations.

FT  16 APR 91 / Small businesses yet to sense recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNS OF an economic recovery are not filtering through to small businesses,
according to the Confederation of British Industry.
Most companies in the sector report that the economy remains 'on the bottom'
with only faint signs of an improvement before the end of the year,
according to Mr Tom O'Connor, chairman of the CBI's small-business council.
Some industries such as engineering, aviation supply and construction have
not seen any improvement in business during the first quarter and no signs
of a recovery.
Mr O'Connor said yesterday that many small companies were still experiencing
difficulties. 'We hope and expect that business will pick up as the year
progresses but there is no doubting the severity of the current recession,'
he said after a meeting of the council in London.
Companies in the West Midlands that relied on the vehicle industry were
'hanging on by their fingertips'.
He said the high level of exports that had helped sustain the industry had
been depressed by slower economic growth among Britain's trade partners,
while the VAT increase and higher tax on company cars was helping to curb
domestic demand.
There were faint signs of optimism among companies in the south-east where
recession was first felt. Regions where recession had bitten later in the
cycle would take longer to recover, he said.

FT  16 APR 91 / Estate agents see thaw start in housing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER evidence of the start of a slow thaw in the housing market is
provided by a survey of English and Welsh estate agents published today.
In the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors survey, agents reported a
modest but widespread increase in the number of buyers looking for homes
last month. The study was conducted before last week's announcement of a
further reduction in interest rates.
Building societies and banks have also noticed an increase in mortgage
inquiries from customers. John Laing construction group says it sold more
homes in the week before last than in any week during the past two years.
According to Halifax Building Society, Britain's biggest society, house
prices rose by 0.9 per cent last month, the first monthly rise in its house
price index since September.
Estate agents say that demand has grown for lower-priced properties in
particular. Prices, however, remained generally static.
The recovery remains fragile, according to the RICS. Optimism over falling
interest rates has been offset in some areas by concern over rising local
unemployment because of the recession. The collapse of Air Europe and other
redundancies, for example, has led to a rise in repossessions in Crawley and
Horsham in Sussex.
More than three quarters of the 63 English and Welsh estate agents
questioned last month said prices had failed to move during the three months
to the end of March.
Most of the previous surveys conducted by the RICS during the past two years
have shown a high proportion of estate agents reporting price falls.
Mr Edward Waterson of estate agents Carter Jonas in North Yorkshire said:
'Life is being breathed back into the market, aided by falling interest
rates and a feeling that the bottom of the market has been reached.'
Mr Andrew Spittle of James and Lister Lea in Solihull in the West Midlands
said: 'Over the past month we have experienced a significant upturn in
activity, with more prospective purchasers looking for properties and an
increased volume of properties coming on to the market. No increase in house
prices has been noted but properties are proving easier to sell.'
London estate agents also reported a slight improvement in demand. Mr Conrad
Mazen of Copping Joyce in Islington, north London, said: 'Although we are
not being inundated with new buyers, those that are looking appear to be
more serious and more sensible offers are being made.'

FT  16 APR 91 / Argentine ambitions founder off Tierra del Fuego: An
ill-conceived scheme to promote industrial development at the ends of the
earth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1972 Argentine strategists announced that security and geopolitical
priorities made it essential to establish a large permanent settlement on
the remote island of Tierra del Fuego, which is divided between Argentina
and Chile. They decided to establish a duty-free zone and offered tax
incentives to attract industry.
Nineteen years and millions of dollars later, the ill-conceived plan is
finally being abandoned as Argentina embraces free trade. As a result,
Ushuaia and Rio Grande, the population of the island's only towns, are
shrinking daily.
Ushuaia, a port of about 30,000 people set between the Beagle Channel and
the southernmost ranges of the Andes, became home to five screwdriver plants
notorious for their poorly crafted and over-priced consumer durables. Now,
the end of incentives and the advent of trade liberalisation could spell the
end for the factories and the 5,000 jobs they provide.
Mr Hugo Iglesias, general manager of Bencer SA, Ushuaia's largest company,
said 'if our protection from imports is ended I would say it spells the end
for the economic development of Tierra del Fuego. Companies will implode.'
Recession has already reduced sales severely and most factories operate at
only 20 per cent of capacity.
If the industrialisation of Tierra del Fuego made little economic sense, it
has at least eased the worries of Argentina's military planners. Strategists
in Buenos Aires have always been anxious to settle Patagonia and Tierra del
Fuego because they suspect Chile covets the under-populated but
resource-rich region.
Hardy Chilean immigrants, who do the menial and labouring jobs the
Argentines refuse to do, have always been in a majority. At one time about
90 per cent of Argentine Tierra del Fuego's population was Chilean. Now it
is estimated at 'only' 60 per cent.
In 1978 the two countries, then run by right-wing military governments,
almost went to war over control of the Beagle Channel.
The immediate 'threat' from Chile faded following Argentina's acceptance in
1984 of Papal arbitration awarding three minuscule islands in the Beagle
Channel to Chile.
However, Argentine Tierra del Fuego is trying to assert a new strategic
importance as the focal point of Argentina's territorial claims in
Antarctica and the South Atlantic.
Formally, Tierra del Fuego has 'jurisdiction' over a region covering 495,000
square miles, which includes the Falkland Islands, three other British-held
island groups in the South Atlantic as well as a section of Antarctica. Maps
of the region carry the legend 'Tierra del Fuego - geographical centre of a
country we must consolidate.'
However, the virtually insolvent government in Buenos Aires has little time
for Tierra del Fuego's territorial ambitions. It can no longer afford to
sustain the expensive and notoriously corrupt incentives schemes.
On April 1, the duty free zone became practically meaningless when the
government replaced formerly insurmountable trade barriers to imported
electronic goods with a single 22 per cent tariff as part of a general trade
liberalisation policy. Overnight, Tierra del Fuego was priced out of the
market.
A 20-inch television set made on the island retailed in Buenos Aires for
Dollars 855 (Pounds 483). A similar set imported from Japan and sold in the
Chilean half of Tierra del Fuego, which is also a duty free zone, retails
for less than half the price. Naturally, there are few homes in Ushuaia
equipped with locally-made goods.
Mr Mario Muia, manager of Continental SACIF, which makes televisions, video
cassette recorders and audio systems, said Tierra del Fuego 'is not a good
deal any more. It's practically impossible to compete with imports.' Mr
Muia, who admits to being the proud owner of an imported Sony stereo, warned
darkly of 'social disaster' on the island unless the trade policy was
reversed.
However, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, retorts that the companies
have 90 per cent profit margins, and says there is scope for them to
compete. Less charitable observers say the companies made even larger
profits by manipulating the incentive regulations.
There is little else to sustain the island's economy. Buenos Aires, its only
market, lies thousands of kilometres away at the other end of a highway
which includes long stretches of rutted and potholed dirt roads that are
closed for weeks in the winter. Most of the island's food is sent from
Buenos Aires, although it is fertile and its waters abound in fish.
If the screwdriver plants do close, what will become of Tierra del Fuego?
Before, it was home to thousands of sheep, a prison colony and a naval base.
Tourism, the region's boosters say, is the obvious alternative. Indeed, on a
hill overlooking the Beagle Channel, Ushuaia's first five star hotel and
casino is under construction.

FT  16 APR 91 / S African steel and gold ban lifted: EC rejects last minute
objections from ANC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EC foreign ministers yesterday ignored last minute objections from the
African National Congress and the European Parliament, and lifted the 1986
ban on the import of South African iron, steel and gold coins.
Welcoming the move, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, Britain's EC affairs minister,
said afterwards that 'as reform is moving ahead in South Africa, we could
start moving ahead by looking at whether sports restrictions and certain
1985 sanctions, such as on the sale of crude oil, could be removed'.
British restrictions on sporting contacts with South Africa were agreed with
the Commonwealth, while most of the 1985 measures, mainly the sale of
military and police equipment, are authorised by the United Nations.
The European Commission has already stepped up aid which amounted to Ecus
120m (Pounds 82.8m) in 1986-90 to Ecus 60m this year for economic projects
to help South African blacks.
The EC decided last year to lift a voluntary ban on investment in South
Africa, and to remove the other 1986 measures, the bans on iron, steel and
gold Krugerrands, once Pretoria had tabled legislation scrapping the main
pillars of apartheid - the Group Areas and Land Acts. This condition has now
been met.
The removal of the sanctions was approved unanimously despite protests from
the ANC, South African trade unions and the pro-sanctions majority in the
European Parliament.
The ministers thus proved bolder than the European Commission, which decided
on March 26 to ask for repeal of the 1986 sanctions, but kept their request
quiet, out of an evident desire to avoid trouble with the European
Parliament.
EC foreign ministers agreed yesterday to ship an extra 400,000 tonnes of
food to the Horn of Africa by the end of May to stave off famine there.
The Commission had told ministers that some 17m people face starvation.
Europe's non-governmental aid organisations said the moves were inadequate.
Some 750,000 tonnes was needed urgently to help some 30m people in the Horn,
where in parts of Eritrea and Tigray stocks will be exhausted in three to
four weeks.
In London, Mrs Lynda Chalker, the overseas development minister, announced a
further Pounds 33m in aid to famine-hit countries in Africa.
About Pounds 30m would be non-food aid aimed specifically at famine and
refugee relief and the remainder on 5,000 tonnes of food for Ethiopia and
Sudan.
The new aid pledge follows Pounds 27m of mainly food aid already offered to
Ethiopia, Sudan, Mozambique, Malawi and Angola since the scale of the crisis
became apparent last September.

FT  16 APR 91 / Iraqi refugees start to panic as US forces withdraw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAFWAN, SOUTHERN IRAQ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REFUGEES in southern Iraq yesterday displayed their growing alarm at the
departure of US forces in the area by staging demonstrations to call for a
permanent UN solution to their plight - or continued US protection.
The protests came as Maj Gen Gunther Greindl, Austrian head of the UN
peacekeeping force in Kuwait and Iraq, arrived in Baghdad for discussions on
the transition to UN supervision of the border area.
The US troops were leaving positions south of the Euphrates River for a
demilitarised zone being established by the UN along the Iraqi-Kuwaiti
border under the ceasefire that took effect last Thursday. The zone reaches
six miles into Iraq and three miles into Kuwait.
The refugees' protests served to underline the headaches the 1,440-strong UN
force will face when it gradually takes up duty on the border area, sometime
within the next two weeks.
The most immediate problem for the 34-nation peace force is the two large
refugee camps it will inherit on the Kuwait-Iraq border, one run by the US
army and the other by the Kuwaiti Red Crescent, which together hold at least
15,000 Iraqis.
Few if any formal arrangements appear to have been made for any transition
of supervision at the camps - which receive daily supplies of water and
boxes of food from the US army.
Major Tom Grubb, the US Civil Affairs officer running the US camp says:
'You'd have thought someone from the UN or the Red Cross would have thought
to talk to me about things, but they haven't yet.'
Aware that Kuwait will refuse them entry, hundreds of refugees have in the
last few days taken to the desert in a further flight, braving thousands of
unexploded allied bomblets which litter the area and have already claimed
five of the campdwellers' lives.
One refugee said most would do all they could to resist returning to Iraq -
apparently pinning hopes on the UN's ability to create a completely neutral
zone to embrace the camps, which US military maps show to lie within Iraq's
borders.
Others echoed this. 'People will lie under tanks to prevent them leaving,'
said Mr Hamid Ali, an refugee working as a nurse on the US army-run camp.
Most refugees said they wanted a 'UN solution' to their plight, though this
appeared generally to amount to being offered political asylum en masse in
the west.
The UN peacekeepers will also find themselves in the midst of increasingly
tense relations between campdwellers and the local townsfolk of Safwan - and
indeed between pro and anti-Saddam factions within the town itself.
US military police units have been maintaining daily patrols through Safwan
since the sudden influx of refugees more than a month ago sparked fights,
thefts and even arson in the poor, bombed and flyblown border town.

<TEXT>
THE Asian Development Bank (ADB) reported yesterday that the Gulf crisis had
cost its developing member countries more than Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 670m)
in lost exports and forgone foreign exchange remittances from migrant
workers.
Added to that is the higher oil price after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. That
cost runs into billions of dollars for Asia's many net oil importers, the
ADB says in its annual report, released yesterday before the bank's annual
meeting in Vancouver on April 24-26.
Oil exporters Indonesia and Malaysia benefited in the short run from the
higher world oil prices, the report said, but for China, another exporter,
'the loss of remittances and construction contracts wrote off most of the
gains'.
Before the Gulf crisis there were about 600,000 Asian workers in Kuwait and
Iraq. 'A large number of them were later repatriated, considerably reducing
the inflow of remittances and adding to the unemployment problem back home,'
says the ADB.
The South Asian countries and the Philippines were particularly hard hit
because of their close economic relations with the Middle East. 'Their
problems were compounded by their big budget and current account deficits
and relatively high inflation rates and debt-service ratios,' the report
adds.
The bank estimated that the crisis had reduced India's growth in 1990 by one
or two percentage points and increased its oil bill by more than Dollars
1bn.
'The newly industrialising economies (NICs) were in a much better position
than other developing member countries to absorb the shock,' the 50-member
bank said.

President Bush and Mr Baker 'are convinced that all parties are taking a

Tutwiler said.
Key issues in further talks with the US will include Israeli refusal to halt
Jewish settlement in the occupied territories and how the Palestinians will
be represented, both issues which could yet derail Mr Baker's peace effort.
Meanwhile Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, will meet Mr Valentin

meeting which underscores the steady improvement over the last two years in
Israeli-Soviet relations.
Mr Shamir will tell Mr Pavlov that Israel's consent to a regional peace
conference held under joint US-Soviet auspices is conditional upon Moscow
first re-establishing full diplomatic ties broken off after the 1967 Six Day
War. Consular relations have been restored and Israel is anxious to complete
the process.

SWEDEN was urged yesterday to smooth the path for foreign companies wishing
to invest in the country.
Sir Brian Corby, president of the Confederation of British Industry, made
the point at a UK-Sweden trade meeting.
He said if Sweden wanted to join the European Community, it must make it
easier for foreign companies to invest in the country. Sir Brian directed
his criticism at company laws, which he claimed did much to discourage
foreign investment.
He said British companies regarded Sweden as a'hostile environment for
foreign investors' because they were unable to hold more than 40 per cent of
the equity and 20 per cent of the voting rights in a Swedish-owned company
without securing the Swedish government's approval.
Last year there were no UK company acquisitions in Sweden at all and only
five in 1989 worth together a mere Pounds 5m .
This contrasts with Sweden's acquisition of 25 UK companies last year and 18
in 1989 worth Pounds 2.945bn.
The ruling Social Democrats are expected to announce a reform of Sweden's
company laws within the next few weeks, but it remains uncertain whether the
changes proposed will meet Sir Brian's criticisms.

EUROPEAN COMMUNITY foreign ministers yesterday gave negotiators from the
European Commission more leeway to reach association agreements with Poland,
Czechoslovakia, and Hungary.
After three rounds, negotiations had reached deadlock, the east Europeans
complaining that the EC was being economically protectionist and politically
evasive in refusing to offer them membership.
The Commission expressed 'considerable satisfaction' at the ministers'
decision yesterday that:
The prospect of membership can figure in the association agreement's
preamble as an ultimate goal, but there will be nothing automatic about it.
The EC will drop its demand for a half-way review of the 10-year phasing in
of mutual free trade. The three east European countries see this review as
putting in question the EC's commitment to free trade.
The east Europeans will be given more time to establish the tariffs they are
supposed to phase out over the 10-year period
Agricultural concessions by the EC can be considered, provided the east
Europeans make a reciprocal effort.
Tariffs on textile imports from east Europe will be eliminated over the 10
years, while restrictions on steel imports will end in five years, provided
the east European countries cut out subsidies to these sectors.
So far, Brussels has not responded to Romania and Bulgaria's interest in
similar association accords. Talks to widen Yugoslavia's long-standing
economic co-operation agreement with the Community are for the moment held
up by the political turmoil there. The EC presidency and Commission are due
to visit Belgrade shortly.

A REPORT from the German government's council of economic advisers has

Germany and warned that 'overhasty actions' in response to the depressed

It also criticised the Treuhand's new priority of restructuring. 'Supporting
unprofitable jobs will merely hold up economic reconstruction,' the report
said. The council predicted unemployment of 1.7m in east Germany this year.
The IFO economic institute has estimated that east Germany needs investment
of DM211bn by the end of the decade to acquire the same quality of
environment as west Germany. However, it appears the preference for building
new nuclear power plants in east Germany, partly on clean air grounds, is
now being reconsidered by the government.
Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, is now seeking a consensus with the
anti-nuclear opposition Social Democrats on energy matters.

FT  16 APR 91 / Yugoslav premier claims western support for reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY, East European Correspondent and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Yugoslav prime minister, Mr Ante Markovic, who is facing growing
internal opposition, says he has the support of western governments for his
economic reforms and his attempts to hold the country together.
Some of the Yugoslav republics, notably Croatia and Serbia, remain
determined to topple him and will try to do so again on Friday when Mr
Markovic will ask the federal parliament who is for, and against, the
reforms.
Despite this dark shadow hanging over his future, Mr Markovic remains an
optimist.
'We have succeeded in passing through this difficult period. The recent
pledge of support - particularly from the US and the EC - means that
Yugoslavia now has a greater chance at becoming integrated eventually into
Europe,' he said.
In a wide-ranging interview in London, where he is attending the
inauguration of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Mr
Markovic, prime minister for the past two years ago, said that without
western support, the country would disintegrate. 'Such a Yugoslavia is in no
western government's interest. For some time, western governments adopted a
'wait and see attitude'.
He admitted that his reforms had had little effect over the past year. His
attempts to impose a strict monetary policy have been undermined by Serbia
which earlier this year printed money to prop up loss-making enterprises.
Other republics were imposing higher taxes on enterprises to finance their
budgets.
Earnings from tourism, which total Dollars 2bn a year, are likely to plummet
following a spate of ethnic unrest, the virtual collapse of JAT, the
Yugoslav airline, and overpriced hotels and restaurants.
Mr Markovic believes that the present struggle waged by some of the
republics against the federal government is not about whether Yugoslavia
should remain a federation, or a confederation of loose states.
'This comparison is merely a facade. A struggle against the reforms is
taking place. It is a struggle for power - and especially totalitarian
power, which caused a great setback for the reforms. We are now paying for
it.'
Mr Markovic believes the reforms are being hampered, not only by
nationalism, but by the absence of clearly defined property rights.
Last year, he had planned to replace socially-owned property, a nebulous
system devised by the late President Tito which placed property outside the
hands of the state and individuals. 'The basic conflict now is between those
who support and oppose private ownership,' he said.
The republic of Croatia, for instance, wants to transfer socially-owned
property to the state, while the republic of Serbia is against individual
ownership rights.
'The new governments know that if they support private ownership, they will
lose their powers. That is why they want to have property in the hands of
the state,' he said. The president of the Czechoslovak National Bank, Mr
Josef Tosovsky, yesterday appealed to western governments and financial
institutions to help the former Comecon countries re-establish trade flows
with the Soviet Union. These have fallen steeply since the switch from
rouble to dollar trading on January 1, writes Anthony Robinson.
'What I have in mind is for western institutions to make future loans to the
Soviet Union conditional on Soviet repayment of east European credits as a
means of re-activating trade which, in the Czechoslovak case, has dropped by
more than 50 per cent this year,' he said in an interview.
The importance of freer access to EC markets was another key issue raised by
east Europeans at the opening of the EBRD.

FT  16 APR 91 / Treuhand restrains media barons in sale of newspapers

<TEXT>
TEN OF east Germany's former communist newspapers were sold to west German
publishers yesterday for a total of DM850m (Pounds 284m) in a
fiercely-contested bidding battle. However, the Treuhand privatisation
agency intervened to ensure that they did not all fall into the hands of the
big four west German media barons.
The Treuhand is anxious to see that west Germany's publishing giants do not
dominate the press market in the east, so it employed New York investment
bankers JP Morgan to organise the bidding and assure the 'highest degree' of
objectivity.
The largest west German publishers secured only one each of the dailies they
bid for. Axel Springer, the nation's largest newspaper publisher, and
Madsack publishing house jointly bought the Leipziger Volkszeitung, which
has a circulation of 379,000.
All other Springer bids were turned down, as were multiple tenders by
Hamburg publisher Gruner &amp; Jahr, which was only allowed to take a majority
stake in Sachsische Zeitung in Dresden, the largest of the regional dailies
with a circulation of 517,000.
Heinrich Bauer obtained the Magdeburger Volksstimme (which has a circulation
of 374,000), but likewise failed in its bid to other regional papers.
Contracts finalising all the takeovers have yet to be signed.
Another large west German magazine publisher, Burda, obtained only the
180,000-circulation Schweriner Zeitung. However, Burda plans to launch a
mass-circulation newspaper in Berlin next month in a head-on challenge to
Axel Springer which dominates tabloid circulation in the capital.
Only two of the 15 east German dailies now remain unsold, and they will come
on the market later when technicalities regarding the sale are resolved.
Three have already been sold.
The purchase by Maxwell Communications and Gruner &amp; Jahr of Berliner Verlag,
publisher of the 300,000-circulation Berliner Zeitung, from the east German
Communist Party was approved by the Treuhand last month.
Mr Karl Schirner, a member of the Treuhand board, said yesterday that the
buyers of the 10 newspapers intended to invest DM1.3bn in them and would
expand overall jobs by nearly 10 per cent to 8,800 by the end of next year.
The Treuhand has also agreed in principle a restructuring programme for east
Germany's shipyards which is likely to cost several billion D-Marks, writes
David Goodhart in Bonn. The DMS group in Rostock is expected to receive
Treuhand-backed liquidity credit of DM500m but will need at least DM3bn in
new investment for a full restructuring.
MR HERO BRAHMS was yesterday appointed vice-president of the Treuhand, a
newly-created post under Mrs Birgit Breuel who last weekend succeeded the
assassinated former president, Mr Detlev Rohwedder, writes Leslie Colitt.
Mr Brahms is a member of the executive board of Hoesch, the steel company
formerly headed by Mr Rohwedder.

<TEXT>
ICL, the UK-based computer company owned by Fujitsu of Japan, has written to
the European Commission and to the British government complaining about
state aid to Bull, the French computer maker.
Commission officials said yesterday they expected further complaints from
other European computer manufacturers. The Commission has already begun
examining the French government's proposed FFr4bn capital injection to Bull,
which lost a record FFr6.8bn last year.
Mr Peter Bonfield, ICL's chairman, said in letters to Sir Leon Brittan, the
EC Commissioner in charge of competition policy, and to Mr Peter Lilley, the
UK trade and industry secretary, that aid to Bull would distort the European
computer market.
He also said that French state aid to Bull could encourage other computer
companies to seek grants from their own governments. The letters added that
allowing state aid for Bull would be contrary to the EC's commitment to
establishing an open and competitive single market.
Bull greeted the ICL complaint with open irritation. 'Such a letter could
not have been drafted in London, but by Fujitsu,' said a senior company
official.
ICL's relations with other European computer companies have suffered since
it was purchased by Fujitsu last year.
Europe's biggest semiconductor research project, the Joint European
Submicron Silicon (Jessi) initiative, last month expelled ICL from three of
the five projects in which it was participating because of its Japanese
links.
ICL was also expelled from the European Information Technology Round Table,
a lobby group, last January.

Poland's Huta Katowice steelworks, one of the country's largest plants, is
suffering a severe cash squeeze and pressing the government to let it be
privatised, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
The steelworks failed to make a Zl 73bn (Pounds 4.3m) payment to the state
budget last month, part of a tax on capital assets in the state sector which
is due to provide some 8 per cent of budget revenues.
Management has told the plant's 16,000 employees that a fall in exports and
domestic sales in the first quarter and a failure by customers to pay bills
could halt production. However, the government is reluctant to agree to
privatisation, which would mean the plant no longer paying tax.

A million workers in the west German building industry yesterday won a 7 per
cent pay increase for this year, writes David Goodhart in Bonn. That is more
than twice the expected inflation rate for 1991 and, in the light of recent
warnings from the Bundesbank, increases the likelihood of higher German
interest rates.
The employers had hoped to keep the deal to just under 7 per cent. However,
their acceptance of the slightly higher figure means the bigger negotiating
group in the metal industry, covering about 6m workers, is also likely to
win at least 7 per cent.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank board member, said yesterday German interest
rates had to stay relatively firm to protect the D-Mark and limit domestic
price risks.

<TEXT>
THE new government of Italy's caretaker prime minister, Mr Giulio Andreotti,
is threatened with collapse even before it presents itself before parliament
tomorrow after the decision by the small Republican party not to endorse it,
writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
The upset, which is without precedent even by the eventful standards of
Italian coalition-building, follows the sharp downgrading of the
Republicans' ministerial representation in Mr Andreotti's new government
unveiled on Friday.
Last night the leaders of the party, a member of the five-party ruling
coalition since the early 1980s, decided by 40 votes to five not to back Mr
Andreotti in parliament - although Mr Giorgio La Malfa, the party secretary,
said this did not necessarily mean a vote against Mr Andreotti. The decision
triggered meetings between President Francesco Cossiga and party leaders in
an attempt to resolve the crisis.
It is now open to question whether Mr Andreotti will try to soldier on with
a four-party coalition or let someone else attempt to form a government.
Leaders of his Christian Democratic party, Italy's biggest, said they did
not favour a four-party coalition and wished to avoid early elections.

MR BORIS YELTSIN, leader of the Russian Federation, said yesterday he would
be prepared to work with President Mikhail Gorbachev to avoid a disaster for
democracy in the Soviet Union. But at the same time, he urged Mr Gorbachev
not to 'turn his back on the process started in our country six or seven
years ago.'
Mr Yeltsin was speaking to Socialist members of the European parliament. He
was criticised by some MEPs for his apparent opposition to Mr Gorbachev, but
he rejected suggestions that there was any animosity between the two men.
He went on to warn that 'the right is preparing disasters for democracy (in
the Soviet Union). . . We have to act to avoid that - to prevent the right
from advancing - and in that struggle we are always prepared to co-operate
with President Gorbachev.'
The Russian leader said hardline Communists rather than Mr Gorbachev could
be to blame for strikes and falling living standards. 'It isn't necessarily
his fault.'
Mr Yeltsin again backed the idea of 'round table' talks with all political
sides, including the unions, which he said could develop into a form of
coalition government.

FT  16 APR 91 / Challengers emerge for UK telecoms market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON and JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO NEW companies are poised to enter the newly-deregulated UK
telecommunications market - representing a potentially serious challenge to
British Telecom and Mercury Communications, the existing long-distance
operators.
British Waterways, the public utility which runs the UK canal system, has
linked up with privately-owned US Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance
telecoms carrier, with a view to providing an alternative long-distance
network in the UK.
The newly privatised electricity supply industry is also considering
entering both the long-distance and local telecoms markets. Last week
chairmen of the twelve regional electricity companies and the National Grid
Company discussed forming a joint-venture to apply for licences.
Both moves were prompted by the government white paper last month which
opened the Pounds 10bn-a-year telecommunications market to competition and
paved the way for any company to apply for licences to supply
telecommunications services.
British Rail has already announced plans to enter the telecoms market by
laying cables alongside its tracks.
The two new challengers believe their existing networks offer them a cheap
way of entering this potentially lucrative market. British Waterways would
lay fibre optic cables along the bottom of its canals, while the electricity
supply industry would hang the cables between its pylons.
British Waterways and Sprint plan to invest between Pounds 50m and Pounds
75m to build a trunk network to within 5 miles of half the UK's population.
Mr David Ingman, British Waterways' chairman, said the aim would be to act
as a carrier's carrier, supplying high quality capacity to other operators,
such as personal communications networks, and large business customers.
Under government regulations British Waterways will not be allowed to invest
any of its own money in the project and most of the shares will have to be
owned by the private sector. The partners intend that GPT, Britain's largest
telecommunications equipment supplier, would provide the submarine cables. A
final decision to proceed with the project will be taken in the next couple
of months after further assessment of the market.
The electricity industry's plans are potentially more ambitious, with one
executive saying a total of Pounds 400m may be invested. The companies are
considering carrying not only telephone, but also television and data
services.
Some regional electricity companies have not yet committed themselves to the
project out of fear that the City would take a dim view of such early
diversification. Others - notably Northern Electric, Norweb, and Yorkshire,
together with the National Grid Company - are enthusiastic because there are
not many other significant opportunities to expand outside their core
business. Norweb and Yorkshire have also considered developing independent
regional telecommunications networks.
The final decision on whether to apply for a licence will be taken in May,
said Mr David Morris, chairman of Northern Electric, who is leading research
into the project for the thirteen companies. 'We have reached a milestone in
the study process,' he said. 'But further work must be done to appraise the
project in financial terms.'

FT  16 APR 91 / Lloyds Bank offers 5% pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK yesterday offered a 5 per cent pay rise to 46,000 non-managerial
staff, in a move which could herald a tougher stance by employers on
earnings as inflation falls.
The bank also said that about 300 senior executives, including its seven
executive directors, would receive no pay rise this year.
The 5 per cent offer, on which Lloyds said there was no room for movement,
compares with a 7 per cent-plus package accepted by Barclays staff and 7 per
cent offered by National Westminster Bank.
Lloyds' move may encourage other financial services employers to make tough
offers. Settlements at the big four clearing banks traditionally set the
tone for negotiations at other companies in the sector.
The decision to freeze the pay of senior management only is unusual among UK
companies. A growing number are freezing pay, but usually for all employees.
Lloyds branch managers have been offered between 3 and 4 per cent.
Explaining the 5 per cent offer, Lloyds said in a letter to employees that
there had been a case for no increase. 'But we recognise the pressures of
inflation . . . particularly (for) those on lower salaries.' Staff costs
were growing faster than income. The benefits of cost savings, including a
cut of 3,000 UK staff in the 14 months to last February, would be lost
unless employees showed restraint. 'We should otherwise be faced with
large-scale compulsory redundancies.'
Bifu, the financial services union, rejected the offer which it described as
a disgrace, but told members that the bank implied that no further offer was
likely. Lloyds Group Union also rejected the offer and told members that the
bank's financial performance in the last financial year bettered that of its
competitors.
The Lloyds offer was due for implementation from April 1, the same date as
the 7 per cent offer at National Westminster. Barclays' 7 per cent-plus deal
was payable from February 1, when the annualised inflation rate was 8.9 per
cent, against less than 7 per cent expected this month. Midland's pay
settlement is due for implementation on June 1. Negotiations have not yet
begun.

FT  16 APR 91 / New bank offers City central role in Europe, says Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITY of London will be turned into the 'financial crossroads' between
east and west with the opening of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, Mr John Major forecast yesterday.
The prime minister, speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the bank which
will have Ecu10bn (Pounds 6.9bn) capital to help former European communist
countries develop market economies, emphasised that Britain intended to play
a 'central role' in the future development of Europe.
He told government leaders, finance ministers and officials from the 39
countries and two European institutions that have set up the bank that it
was a 'natural fit' that London, as Europe's premier financial centre,
should become the bank's home. It had a wealth of experience in the
privatisation of state-owned businesses.
The establishment of market economies in eastern Europe would not be easy
but the European bank would make the transition a little easier and less
painful.
Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, said the bank's creation was a
step towards the development of a 'great Europe'. It would be the bank's job
to encourage democracy and he warned that democratic institutions in eastern
Europe would be the most fragile and threatened by the hardships of
restructuring.
Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president, said it was unique for three
reasons: it was the first institution of the post-Cold War period; the first
institution of a united Europe; and the first institution of a new world
order.
However, the fact that European Community countries have a majority holding
in the bank's capital appears to pose difficulties for the US. Mr Nicholas
Brady, the US treasury secretary, struck one of the few discordant notes. He
said that developments in Europe contained a special problem for the US.
'We should not be asked to accept the lowest common denominator that emerges
from EC debate as the basis for international negotiation and we cannot be
asked to negotiate the same issue twice - once with the EC as a whole and
then again with the individual member states,' he said.
Mr Attali said the new bank brought together former political, economic and
ideological adversaries 'who would have found it unimaginable two years ago
to be seated round this table today'.
The bank has an overt political goal in that the former communist states it
has been set up to help must be 'committed to and applying the principles of
multi-party democracy, pluralism and market economics.'
While it is likely to be some time before the bank has a significant impact
on eastern Europe, its eastern and central European member states have high
expectations.
Mr Jan Bielecki, prime minister of Poland, called on the become an EC
member. Mr Jozsef Antall, the Hungarian prime minister, drew a parallel
between the creation of the bank and the setting up of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank after the Second World War.

FT  16 APR 91 / Draft insurance law scrapped for exports to high risk
countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government last night scrapped draft legislation requiring it to
continue insuring UK sales to politically risky developing countries for
three years after the Export Credits Guarantee Department is privatised.
Spurning urgent pleas from exporters, Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, won
Commons backing to quash an amendment introduced to the ECGD privatisation
bill before Easter as the result of a Conservative backbench rebellion.
The bill will allow for privatisation of ECGD's Cardiff-based short-term
export credit insurance business. Mr Sainsbury's announcement came in the
face of lobbying by exporters, the Confederation of British Industry and
Labour to retain the clause.
He said the amendment was technically deficient and failed to account for
the complexity of the export and insurance markets. Goods covered by it
accounted for less than half a per cent of Britain's non-oil visible
exports.
Mr Sainsbury sought to appease exporters with an assurance that the need for
a 'national interest facility' for political risk reinsurance would be kept
under review. The government's intention was that the facility would
continue as long as it was considered 'essential to meet the reasonable
needs of exporters.'
The amendment, proposed by Mr Keith Hampson, Tory MP for Leeds North West,
would have obliged the government to provide insurance or re-insurance
against 'political risk' for a minimum of three years after privatisation.
It would have mainly covered exports to developing countries where political
and economic crises could prevent even creditworthy customers from obtaining
foreign exchange to pay their bills.
Exporters say they depend on such cover for sales to a range of countries,
including important markets such as the Soviet Union, Hong Kong, India and
South Africa. The loss of such support would deprive them of backing
available to foreign competitors.
Some Tory backbenchers fear the decision could sour the government's
reputation with exporters.

FT  16 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Market moves towards a new peak
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK STOCKS shook off a somewhat dull backcloth yesterday to move towards new
peaks before being thwarted in late dealings by an unimpressive start to the
new Wall Street session. Earlier, the market had bounced ahead to challenge
its previous intra-day highs, supported by activity in the FT-SE futures
sector. A firm performance by sterling also helped sentiment, although
market strategists continued to suggest that further cuts in UK base rates
may be delayed until later this year.
Poor trading volume for the first day of the new equity market account
appeared to indicate an underlying lack of enthusiasm. The Footsie Index
gained more than 25 points in early trading but came off the top as the
premium on the futures contract faded. The market's gain, already clipped to
less than 20 points, came under further pressure when Wall Street reversed
an early gain to show a fall of 1.24 on the Dow as London closed down for
the day. London is acutely sensitive to Wall Street influences at present
because of the possibility of cuts in US interest rates.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,542.8, a gain of 16.7 on the
session and a mere 2.5 below the all-time high achieved on April 5. At
mid-morning the Index challenged, but failed to reach, the intra day peak of
2,552.1 of April 5.
Traders agreed that it was a session featured more by a rise in market
indices than by any change in investment sentiment. In early trading the
market was led forward by a modest premium on the FT-SE June contract
against fair value. By the end of the session this premium had been largely
eliminated and equities were left to drift off from their best levels. Seaq
trading volume was sharply lower at 394.1m shares, against 621.4m on Friday.
However, it was clear that the big institutions remain unwilling to sell
stock and will buy shares at suitable prices. Hints that a significant
corporate move is pending in the stock market resurfaced strongly in late
dealings, although there was no general agreement on whether this would be a
substantial fund-raising or a bid for a Footsie-listed stock. Expectations
of further rights issues were unaffected by further relatively modest cash
calls, notably for Pounds 96m from Morgan Crucible, the London-based
industrial materials group.
While the market was helped by the firmness on Wall Street on Friday, which
reflected hopes that the Federal Reserve would soon cut US interest rates,
investment optimism was a little more subdued in London yesterday. Friday's
cut of half a point in UK base rates, followed by the reductions in house
lending rates which will help the fight against inflation, has left the
London stock market with little to look forward to in the immediate future.
Further base rate reductions are assumed, but it is expected that these will
wait for clear news of improvement in the core rate of domestic inflation.
Oil shares again attracted support as last week's uptick in crude oil prices
reversed some of the more bearish views on the sector taken recently by at
least one leading UK securities house. International blue chip stocks were
also firmer yesterday, despite the improvement in sterling which is a
bearish factor for their overseas earnings. BAT Industries and Glaxo stood
out well, with the weak feature provided by ICI, still overshadowed by
bearish statements from the boardroom earlier this year.

FT  16 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market was led higher yesterday by equity futures, which
continued to anticipate an end to the recession later in the year.
With locals short of futures the market quickly moved to a premium of 40
points to the spot index and shares were promptly marked higher.
Dealers said the move up had been largely technical and there had been few
buyers. Instead a cluster of sellers waited for their opportunity. When the
FT-SE index failed to clear 2,550 the sellers pounced.
Pressure from US equity futures as the Federal Reserve indicated that it
would not ease monetary policy triggered further selling. UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew said buying futures at current levels would anticipate only good
economic news and recommended investors sell futures.
June FT-SE closed at 2,576, up 18 points on the day and 31 points above the
cash index, which is close to fair value.
In traded options, BP April 330 calls were actively traded as the shares
rallied. Euro FT-SE was boosted as institutions bought December 2,525 calls
and sold 2,725 calls for the same month, suggesting the market would not
rise much further by the year end.
Boots calls were actively traded as investors bought back their option
positions and rolled them into other forward months.

FT  16 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Tax reform hits shipping sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PLANNED overhaul of Norway's 80-year-old tax system by the minority Labour
Government has disappointed the stock market, and especially the shipping
sector.
Last week, when the scheme was leaked and then announced, Oslo's all-share
index fell by 2.6 per cent to 480.72 and its shipping index by 6.3 per cent.
Yesterday, the all-share fell another 2.99 points to 477.73, and shipping by
7.98 to 578.31.
In a move to streamline the fiscal system the government proposes to lower
the rate of corporate tax from 50.8 per cent to 28 per cent, the lowest of
any OECD country. But allowances, which led to an average corporate tax rate
of only 20 per cent, will be severely reduced.
Shipping companies are likely to suffer most if the proposal is passed by
the Storting, Norway's parliament, since the depreciation rate for their
assets will be cut from 25 per cent to 14 per cent, against the 20 per cent
expected.
This will make it unattractive to renew the ageing fleet of the world's
third-biggest shipping register. Norway's shippers have a total of 160 ships
on order, roughly 15 per cent of the world total, and may threaten to take
flight to more accommodating countries like Liberia.
According to James Capel, the UK stockbrokers, the change implies a tenfold
increase in taxes paid by shippers. Bergesen, Norway's biggest shipowner, is
an example: its tax bill for 1990 was NKr15m against an estimated NKr250m
under the proposed new system.
On a more positive note, the reform also calls for the abolition of double
taxation of dividends. This could allow companies to pay out more, but
Capel's 1991 yield estimate for the market is only 1.3 per cent.
The government also proposes to allow large tax-free gains, accumulated in
limited shipping partnerships under the existing system, to be converted
into onshore equity investments. They will be allowed to be invested part of
these profits in shares of on-shore companies and part of them in non-listed
venture companies which invest in on-shore commercial activity.
The reform is scheduled to be implemented in 1992. It includes a cut in tax
on capital investment from 7 to 5 per cent.

FT  16 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt offers unusual
contrast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE EXCEPTION of an unusually positive Frankfurt, individual shares
featured yesterday as bourses put in a mixed performance. Zurich was closed
for the Spring Festival, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT broke up through the 1,600 resistance level on the DAX index
following last week's failed attempt. After a 7.82 rise to 680.28 in the FAZ
index at midsession, the DAX closed 18.28, or 1.2 per cent higher at
1,601.42, its best finish since the 1602.29 high for 1991 recorded on March
8.
Speculation that the US will soon cut interest rates took pressure off the
D-Mark. Buying of blue chips helped the index to rise and triggered buying
of other stocks as volume rose from DM4.9bn to DM6.0bn.
Among the international favourites, Deutsche Bank gained DM9.50 to DM648,
Daimler DM17.20 to DM684.20 and Siemens DM6.60 to DM603.60.
However, last week's winners fell by the wayside. In retailers, Karstadt
fell DM2 to DM613; in construction, Bilfinger &amp; Berger eased DM6 to DM884;
and in utilities, the relatively diminutive VEW dropped DM5 to DM224.
MILAN was dominated by last-minute technical adjustments before today's
close of the April trading account. The Comit index fell 2.66 to 591.54 in
volume estimated below Friday's L170bn.
Cir, the holding company of Mr Carlo De Benedetti, fell L55 or 2.1 per cent
to L2,615 on news that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, allied with members of the
Formenton and Mondadori families, had won board control of the Mondadori
publishing group. Dealers said it was likely that there would be a two-tier
settlement to the long-running battle. Mr De Benedetti would first sell his
stake in Mondadori to Mr Berlusconi and then get control of the newspaper La
Repubblica, the weekly magazine L'Espresso and the art and cultural
publications in return for a lump sum. They added, however, that the L300bn
figure rumoured in the market was unacceptable to Cir.
AMSTERDAM was strengthened by an early Wall Street rise and a strong showing
from Royal Dutch. The CBS tendency index ended 1.3 higher at 97.1. The oil
company rose Fl 4 to Fl 154.60, a high for the year, following its annual
presentation on Friday and on hopes that the dividend will be raised this
year.
Heineken gained Fl 3.40 to Fl 161.40 on hopes that the current warm weather
in the Netherlands heralds a hot summer. The brewer attributed its rise in
sales in both 1989 and 1990 to unseasonably warm summer weather.
Yesterday the bourse said it had scrapped the listing of the remaining
shares in the insurer Nationale-Nederlanden and NMB Postbank on Friday after
their merger in March.
BRUSSELS saw active trade in Delhaize on reports that an investor had built
up a 5 per cent stake. The retailer said it planned to renew an
anti-takeover 'poison pill' at an extraordinary shareholders meeting on May
3. The share rose as high as BFr8,390 before closing BFr190 lower at
BFr7,970 with 30,600 shares traded. The Bel-20 index rose 1.51 to 1,208.07.
PARIS started firm on interest rate hopes, but fell back to end with the
CAC-40 index up 0.92 at 1,822.35, off a high of 1,832.72, in volume down
from FFr2.7bn to FFr1.5bn.
Michelin climbed FFr1.50 to FFr90.20 with 263,350 shares traded on
speculative buying ahead of the 1990 results due on Wednesday. Alcatel
Alsthom, which announced a spate of contracts, rose FFr5 to FFr600. Suez
dropped FFr7 to FFr337.50 on expectations of a fall in profits at its unit
Societe Generale de Belgique. BSN, a recent underperformer, rose FFr11 to
FFr849.
MADRID swallowed early disappointment that the Bank of Spain had left its
benchmark intervention rate unchanged and was led higher by the utilities
and banking sectors. The general index added 1.90 to 282.99 in volume
estimated at Pta14bn after Friday's Pta17.5bn.
STOCKHOLM recovered from a weak opening to close marginally higher in quiet
trade. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 2.8 to 1,098.8 in turnover of
SKr235m after SKr287m.
VIENNA reached its highest level since last August. The bourse index rose
5.1 to 592.43.

FT  16 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Margin trading hopes
keep focus on second-liners

Tokyo
HIGHER futures prices prompted arbitrage buying at the opening, but
afternoon profit-taking cut some of the gains. Activity among front-line
stocks remained subdued and investor interest turned to the second section
on hopes that restrictions on margin trading would be lifted, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average finished moderately higher at 26,695.53, up 113.03,
having opened at the day's low of 26,620.08 and reached the day's high of
26,896.14 in the morning.
Volume remained low at 380m shares. Gainers led losers by 524 to 443, with
194 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 7.50
to 2,012.06 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.25 to 1,514.04.
Short-term interest rates eased and the overnight unsecured call rate fell
below 8 per cent for the first time since February 13. Miss Benedicte Ivey
at Credit Lyonnais said that the stronger yen and lower short-term rates
might persuade institutional investors back into the market.
Interest-rate sensitive issues gained. Financials, the best performing
sector of the day, added 2.86 per cent. Industrial Bank of Japan added Y90
to Y3,740 and Mitsubishi Bank climbed Y30 to Y2,650.
Sumitomo Metal Industries, the most active issue of the day, rose Y1 to
Y548. There were hopes that it would receive orders for seamless pipes from
the Soviet Union. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is due to arrive in
Japan for a visit today.
Institutional investors dabbled in smaller stocks for quick profits. Nippon
Express, the parcel delivery company, rose Y16 on reports of a rise in
delivery fees, but gains were cut by profit-taking and the issue finished up
Y4 to Y950.
Isuzu Motors fell Y28 to Y536 on reports that the company's earnings would
be hurt by poor truck sales and heavy interest payments.
Smaller steel issues rose on strong earnings forecasts. Yamato Kogyo added
Y70 to Y1,940 on speculation that it would win orders from Japan Railway.
Nippon Yakin Kogyo, the stainless steel maker, added Y20 to Y1,010.
In Osaka the OSE average gained 214.12 to 29,994.54 on volume of 37.7m
shares. Nihon Spindle, expecting a 16 per cent increase in its pre-tax
profits in the current year, gained Y40 to Y1,070. Investors were also
attracted by growing sales of a product which removes poisonous dioxin from
contaminated water.
Nintendo, the game maker, added Y300 to Y16,900 on reports of an increase in
shipments of Super Family Computer, its new video game. The issue has been
depressed recently on concerns over margin positions.
Roundup
MOST Pacific Rim markets started the week on a positive note yesterday.
NEW ZEALAND surged 2.3 per cent on optimism that inflation data due tomorrow
will trigger a further cut in interest rates. Turnover was heavy for a
Monday at NZDollars 25.3m. The Barclays index rose 27.94 to 1,430.78.
HONG KONG bounced back above 3,700 after an early 60-point plunge on worries
over the fate of the proposed airport and seaport project. The Hang Seng
index closed 31.93 lower at 3,710.07 in turnover of HKDollars 1.15bn after
HK1.53bn.
TAIWAN rallied for the sixth day. The banking sector, which makes up half of
the weighted index, soared 5.62 per cent. The index rose 78.35 or 1.4 per
cent to 5,671.45 in turnover of TDollars 84.58bn after TDollars 74.4bn.
AUSTRALIA reached the day's high near the close on late buy orders. The All
Ordinaries index rose 7.0 to 1,462.7 in turnover of ADollars 140.29m.

49.5m ahead of the holidays today and tomorrow. The composite index added
2.83 to 580.11.

194.1m. SEOUL saw volume fall from Saturday's half-day Won65.5bn to

FT  16 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Austria stands out in flat week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AGGREGATE, the world was flat last week. Europe and Japan moved into
decline after improvements in the previous week, and this cancelled out a
rise of 1.2 per cent in the US. Interest rate hopes affected Wall Street and
Tokyo, the former ending higher last Friday on hopes of a cut this week.
Europe lost its glow with a fall, excluding the UK, of 0.4 per cent. Sassoon
(Europe), UK arm of the Singapore-based stockbrokers, estimates that a
portfolio of European blue chips brought investors a return of approaching
30 per cent in the first quarter of 1991, a process it describes as 'the
suckers' rally'. According to Mr Roger Hornett, who leads on Europe, this is
a rise in a bear market, brought on by people who do not want to miss the
next bull run. It is there to be enjoyed, he says, but participants should
remember to sell out before the next bear market leg.
In Germany, Italy and France, says Sassoon, earnings have been
disappointing, even if in the Netherlands and Spain the surprises have been
on the upside. 'Volumes are beginning to close back down,' the broker
observes, adding: 'This gift horse has the most rotten of teeth.'
Last week's best European performer was Austria, up 2.2 per cent after a
similar rise in the five days before. Mr Andrew Thomson of Kleinwort Benson
said last week that he was raising his short term weighting for the country
for several reasons:
The end of the Gulf war could see the end to the recent volatility of the
market;
economic prospects remain well above average;
earnings growth remains healthy;
the chart of the domestic index is giving a buy signal;
anticipated equity issues, think Kleinwort, are now largely discounted and
liquidity has been building up;
a cut in asset tax on equities would help the market; and, finally,
any hint of recovery in the economies of Austria's eastern neighbours could
strongly boost equity sentiment.

FT  16 APR 91 / Money Markets: No change in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Spain left its money market intervention rate, the main
instrument of credit policy, unchanged at 13.50 per cent at a repurchase
tender for central bank certificates yesterday.
Friday's consumer price index for March indicated year-on-year inflation was
unchanged at 5.9 per cent. This was better than forecast, but the underlying
rate was still around 7.5 per cent. Nevertheless, the strength of the peseta
in the ERM had encouraged hopes that the Bank of Spain might cut its
intervention rate.
Overnight money firmed to 13.69 from 13.585 per cent after the tender and
one-week funds rose to 13.675 from 13.6125 per cent.
In London the short end of the money market showed little movement, but
longer rate were firm. Trading was quiet, lacking pressure for any further
change, after Friday's cut in bank base rates.
Three-month sterling interbank was quoted at 11 29/32 -11 27/32 against 11
15/16 -11 13/16 per cent previously. One-year money rose to 11 1/2 -11 3/8
from 11 7/16 -11 5/16 per cent.
The Bank of England initially forecast a money market credit shortage of
Pounds 850m. This was revised to Pounds 800m at noon, and was changed back
to Pounds 850m in the afternoon. Total assistance of Pounds 757m was
provided.
An early round of help was offered and at that time the authorities bought
Pounds 393m bills outright, by way of Pounds 100m bank bills in band 1 at 11
7/8 per cent and Pounds 293m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent.
Before lunch another Pounds 204m bank bills were purchased in band 2 at 11
13/16 per cent.
In the afternoon Pounds 80m bank bills were bought in band 2 at 11 13/16 per
cent and late assistance of around Pounds 80m was also provided.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 621m, with exchequer transactions absorbing
Pounds 675m and bank balances below target Pounds 155m. These outweighed a
fall in the note circulation adding Pounds 600m to liquidity.
In Frankfurt call money rose to 8.80 from 8.75 per cent, ahead of today's
terms for this week's securities repurchase agreement tender by the
Bundesbank. Dealers expect the central bank to offer one-month money at an
unchanged 8.60 per cent, and two-month funds at variable bid rates.

FT  16 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Fed action fails to lift dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR fell yesterday despite an indication from the US Federal Reserve
that it has not eased its monetary stance.
The Fed drained reserves from the New York banking system via matched sale
and repurchase agreements, when Federal funds were trading at 5 1/2 per
cent, well below the assumed target level of 6 per cent.
This also came about an hour earlier than usual, which was taken as a signal
that the Fed is underlining the present interest rate structure and has not
been encouraged to ease policy by the news on Friday that US year-on-year
inflation had fallen below 5 per cent in March.
A further fall in US interest rates is not ruled out however,and this
encouraged the market to test the dollar's downside yesterday. Opinion
suggests that traders are looking to pick up dollars below the present value
if there is another cut in US rates, believing that any further easing by
the Fed is likely to be the last in this economic cycle.
At the close of trading in London the dollar had fallen to DM1.6755 from
DM1.6845; to Y134.45 from Y136.25; to SFr1.4230 from SFr1.4275; and to
FFr5.6550 from FFr5.6900. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index
declined to 64.3 from 64.8.
The D-Mark improved against the dollar, but lost ground to the Japanese yen
as speculation faded that the Bank of Japan is about to cut its discount
rate.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi in London, notes that
inflation in Japan has not yet established a convincing peak and that
deceleration in the economy will not be sharp enough to warrant a relaxation
of monetary policy until the middle of the year.
Economists at Nomura Research Institute agreed that present monetary policy
is likely to be maintained, with the Bank of Japan still worried about the
underlying rate of inflation and the high ratio of money supply growth to
gross national product.
With the D-Mark under a cloud created by the unification of Germany and
growing unrest in the Soviet Union, the German currency fell to Y80.25 from
Y80.90. Dealers expect the D-Mark to test support at Y80.00 in the very near
future, amid fear that a fall though that level would prompt a reassessment
of European currency risks by Japanese investors.
Sterling bounced off a high of DM3.00, but finished higher against the
D-Mark, despite Friday's cut in UK bank base rates.
The pound remained the second strongest member of the European exchange rate
mechanism, rising to DM2.9975 from DM2.9950 and closing unchanged at
FFr10.1150. It gained 1.15 cents to Dollars 1.7890 and also rose to
SFr2.5450 from SFr2.5375, but fell to Y240.50 from Y242.25. Sterling's index
climbed 0.3 to 93.3.

There was good general demand except for the plainest teas, reports the Tea
Brokers' Association. Bright liquoring descriptions and better mediums sold
well at dearer rates. The balance of the offerings were barely steady with
plainer sorts a weak feature. Coloury Central Africans remained fully firm
but others showed an easier tendency. Ceylons attracted less competition at
mostly lower rates with some withdrawals. In the offshore auction Kenyas met
limited and selective support but other origins came to a good enquiry at
marginally lower levels. Quotations: quality 275p, medium 112p, low medium

FT  16 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: India fears export fall in
diamonds
</HEADLINE>

   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A STEEP fall in India's exports of cut and polished diamonds is feared next
month after a disruption in imports of 'rough' diamonds, on which the
exporters depend.
The fall is expected to follow the 50 per cent cash deposit put on letters
of credit for raw diamond imports three weeks ago by the Reserve Bank of
India, the country's central bank, as part of a package to delay imports and
ease pressure on foreign exchange reserves.
The supply of raw diamonds will last untill May when exporters fear
operations will stop if the levy is not repealed. Mr Kaushik Mehta, chairman
of the gem and jewellery export promotion council, says two hundred thousand
will lose their jobs. Mr Mehta objects to the 50 per cent cash margin
payment because diamond traders operate on volumes and thin profit margins.
This is the second crisis in the diamond businesses in a year. Finished
diamond exports fell by a fifth in April to June last year following a dip
in the US offtake and a shift in demand to large diamonds from small ones,
in which India specialises.
India's exports of finished diamonds and jewellery in the year to March 1991
dropped by 3 per cent to Rs53.1bn (Pounds 1.53bn).

FT  16 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: NFU outlines proposals for
reforming CAP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK'S National Farmers' Union, which has consistently opposed the
European Commission's plans for reforming the Common Agricultural Policy,
yesterday outlined its own proposals.
The basis of the NFU plan follows the lines of the US programme, allowing
individual farmers to make the choice between supported prices and
production controls, or no support and no control.
For cereals, current price support mechanisms would be maintained, but only
under an annual set-aside programme. 'Those farmers who did not wish to
reduce their own production would be required to pay a levy, probably on a
hectare basis and related to regional yields,' the NFU proposes in a paper
which has been presented to Copa, the Brussels-based lobby for European
farmers' unions.
Individual farmers could also choose to reduce production by
extensification, nitrogen reduction or by contracting to supply grain for
non-food uses.
The oilseed sector could use the same system, the NFU suggests. Beef and
sheep premiums could be related to stocking density in such a way that
farmers who wished to obtain support could be obliged to reduce their
output.
Mr David Naish, president of the NFU, said yesterday continuing indecision
on the CAP was 'extremely damaging'. It was important for Copa to come up
with firm proposals on CAP reform, otherwise the proposals of Mr Ray
MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner, would be taken up by default.
The MacSharry proposals envisage curbing support for large farms and
targetting help at smaller farms.

FT  16 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmers Viewpoint): Tenant
farmers fear return to Dark Ages - Proposals by John Gummer to deregulate
the farm tenancy law will limit protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF PROPOSALS put forward by Mr John Gummer, the Minister of Agriculture,
become law, relationships between landowners and tenant farmers will be back
in the Dark Ages.
So say some elderly tenants who remember the days before the Second World
War. They speak of ruthless landlords who, in the absence of laws providing
security of tenure, evicted a tenant on a whim. They tell of tenants who
allowed the fertility of their land to deteriorate and buildings to fall
down because they had no guarantee of how long their tenure would last, nor
of compensation for improvements they might make to the landowner's
property.
The Agriculture Act of 1947, sponsored by Labour Agriculture Minister Tom
Williams, changed that. As well as setting up a system of guaranteed prices
for farm commodities, it gave tenants security of tenure for their lifetime,
always provided, of course, that they paid their rents regularly and were
not guilty of some gross breach of the tenancy agreement. Also, it
established a framework of law to guide both parties to such agreements and
through which disputes between landlords and tenants could be resolved.
In 1976 another Labour government introduced legislation for England and
Wales which provided security of tenure for three generations of farming
families on the same land, which had been the case in Scotland for some
years. However, while the measure may have been intended to help tenant
farmers, it had the opposite effect.
Landowners, who had already shown reluctance to let farms for one tenant's
lifetime, refused point blank to lose control of their land for three
generations, and the trickle of farms available to let dried up completely.
The Agricultural Holdings Act of 1986, introduced by the Conservatives,
cancelled three-generation succession and reverted to security of tenure for
one lifetime on new tenancies. However, it made little subsequent difference
to the availability of farms to let. Landowners, with the help of their
agents, had by then found ways to circumvent the law and were enjoying the
freedom it afforded them.
Many took their land in hand and farmed it themselves with advice from
agents or consultants. Others turned over their farms to professional
management companies set up for the purpose, which ran them either on
contract, in partnership, or according to some form of share farming
agreement.
In all cases, the arrangements avoided setting up legal tenancies and
enabled the landowner to regain control of his land within a relatively
short and predetermined period, thereby preserving the so-called 'vacant
possession premium'. This is the difference in value at auction between let
land and land in hand, and varies these days between 33 per cent and 50 per
cent in favour of land in hand.
Obviously few landowners would voluntarily forgo such an advantage, even if
they had no immediate intention of selling. Almost all tenanted farms that
have changed hands in recent years have done so according to one or other of
the non-tenancy routes.
Meanwhile, with the growth in owner-occupation of land and the associated
decline in the let sector - from 90 per cent in 1910 the number of tenanted
farms has shrunk to 36 per cent today - young farmers with limited capital
wishing to make a start in the industry have for several years now
experienced great difficulty in finding farms to rent.
That, presumably, was the motivation behind John Gummer's proposals,
announced two months ago to deregulate farm tenancy law. Also, the NFU has
failed to come up with a workable way to reform the present rules, which are
observed more in their avoidance than their compliance. The new proposals as
they stand would remove most of the protection previously provided for
tenants and allow almost complete freedom of contract between parties.
Insiders have suggested that the minister's proposals were virtually written
by the Country Landowners' Association, and they certainly appear to lean in
the landlord's favour. If adopted, they would abolish security of tenure for
new tenants (existing agreements would not be affected); there would be no
statutory minimum term; no automatic right to renew a tenancy at the end of
an agreed term; no statutory period for notice to quit; and no arbitration
procedure for the settlement of disputes.
The idea is clearly to allow maximum flexibility and that, of course, has
merit. The virtual removal of the entire framework of law against which
tenancy agreements could be written, however, appears to be worrying even
the CLA, and it seems likely that they, the NFU, the Tenant Farmers'
Association, and the Young Farmers' Clubs, all of whom have similar
interests but different priorities, will urge the minister not to be quite
so radical.
The danger is that, in the absence of the kind of statutory framework that
currently exists, every dispute could turn into a test case in the courts.
None of the parties involved wants farm tenancies to become a lawyer's
benefit.
That said, there is widespread acceptance that change is necessary, if only
to recognise what is already happening in the market place. Some of the
ideas floated in the minister's proposals will be widely welcomed. The
assignability of a tenancy, for instance, would be regarded as a great step
forward by many, although provision for this, like so many of the proposals,
would be up to the individuals concerned.
As a farm tenant for more than 30 years, the agreement under which I operate
would be unaffected by any new legislation. However, if I were signing to
rent a new farm, in order to avoid the Dark Ages of some tenants' fears, I
would wish to see as an absolute minimum statutory provisions for reviewing
rent, up or down; a legally binding formula on compensation for improvements
done by either party; and a standard procedure for arbitration of disputes.
Beyond that, the more flexibility and freedom of contract the better, so far
as I am concerned. But I doubt if, in reality, a new law on the lines
proposed would bring about significant improvements for young farmers
seeking to get a start in the industry.

FT  16 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Row as LME fails to act over
squeeze on zinc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW blew up yesterday about the apparent inaction of the London Metal
Exchange's executive committee in the face of a technical squeeze on the
zinc market. The backwardation - premium for cash metal over forward prices
 -soared to Dollars 217 a tonne.
Traders said that during the late afternoon Dollars 60 a tonne was being
paid to borrow zinc for one day but this eventually fell back to Dollars 20.
When a similar situation arose on the exchange in December, 1989, the LME
executive imposed a limit of Dollars 20 a tonne on the daily backwardation
and questions were being asked last night about why it had not acted this
time.
Traders suggested Metallgesellschaft, the German group, was playing a key
role but its LME ring dealing subsidiary insisted there was no concerted
action either by MG or its many customers to squeeze the market.
Some of its associates had turned to the LME to cover sales contracts which
they might have difficulty filling because of technical difficulties. For
example, in Canada Cominco's Trail lead-zinc refinery was not performing
properly yet; in Australia floods in Queensland had delayed shipments by
MIM; and in Germany the Berzelius refinery was to close sooner than expected
for a refit.
An MG official said that it had not attempted 'to draw blood' from the
shorts - those who had sold zinc they did not own and were now attempting to
cover their positions - and its customers had all agreed to back MG's
efforts to ensure that the LME zinc market remained liquid.
The LME executive had been kept fully informed. He hoped that the shorts
also had good reasons for their position. 'But our clients are zinc miners,
smelters, refiners and dealers and I have no sympathy for anyone who
deliberately sells zinc they do not own to push the price down just because
a trend line on a chart crosses a particular point.
Traders said the main victim of the squeeze was an investment fund and that
the squeeze was likely to be over by the end of April.
Meanwhile, the large backwardation is drawing huge quantities of zinc into
LME warehouses and traders are expecting an extra 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes to
show up in today's stock figures.
Mr Robin Bhar, analyst at Carr Kitcatt &amp; Aitken, said there was no
fundamental reason for zinc prices to rise. 'There are ample stocks of the
metal,' he said.
The LME executive failed to respond to a request for comment last night
after zinc for immediate delivery closed Dollars 107.5 a tonne up at Dollars
1,430 while metal for delivery in three months rose by Dollars 6.50 a tonne
to Dollars 1,213.50.

FT  16 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Mexico seeks benchmark for
private sector funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S return to the international capital markets is aimed primarily at
establishing a benchmark for private sector entities which are now actively
raising overseas finance, Mr Angel Gurria, under-secretary for international
finance, said in London.
Speaking at the weekend as Nacional Financiera, the Mexican state finance
company, raised the size of its latest 10 per cent Eurobond by Dollars 25m
to Dollars 125m, Mr Gurria said there was now no public sector deficit to
finance.
The private sector was well-placed to finance the country's current account
deficit, officially projected at some Dollars 6bn this year, but thought
likely to be higher by private economists.
'The reason why we went to the market was to set a marker,' he said. Private
sector borrowers who have projects to finance 'were all over the place,' he
said.
The public sector was authorised to borrow up to Dollars 2.7bn this year,
but even if it reached this total, Mexico's debt would still decline as a
proportion of economic output.
Mr Gurria was in London to promote foreign investment in Mexico ahead of the
expected flotation this spring of a further tranche of the government's
remaining 26 per cent stake in Telmex, the telephone utility. The sale will
mark the first time a developing country has sold a public utility through
the international capital markets.
Mexico's buoyant economy had prompted a return of flight capital estimated
at some Dollars 5bn over the past 18 months and a similar amount in direct
foreign investment, he said.
These flows should continue despite the widening current account deficit and
last November's decision to slow the rate of peso devaluation to a level
below inflation. The government's ability to deal with the economy was
bolstered by its high foreign exchange reserves, estimated by private
Mexican economists at some Dollars 13bn.
The 5 per cent devaluation rate was sufficient in the light of US inflation
and productivity increases in Mexico, he said. Foreign investors were also
being attracted by the prospect of a free trade agreement with the US and
Canada.
'Domestic interest rates continue to drop. Money continues to come in. So we
must be doing something right,' he said.
Telmex has reported profits of 3.3bn pesos (Dollars 1.1m) for last year, an
increase of 82 per cent in real terms over 1990. Revenues grew by 44 per
cent to 11.3bn pesos.
The results, which are better than expected, reflect recent increases in
telephone tariffs, and a rise in the number of telephones in service. Under
the terms of its government contract, Telmex is expected to make an annual
real rate of return of 12 per cent on capital employed.
In May the Mexican government will sell a 14 per cent stake in Telmex
through an international offering. At current prices the issue is worth
Dollars 1.7bn. Just under 7 per cent of the shares will be issued in Mexico,
50 per cent in the US and the rest in Europe and Japan.
The offering, if successful, will be one of the biggest in the international
capital markets. It will reduce the Mexican government's stake to 12 per
cent.
The issue will be co-ordinated by Goldman Sachs and managed in the UK by S.
G. Warburg and in Japan by Nomura. Mr Gurria said it would help bring some
liquidity to a stock market still plagued by a shortage of paper.

SAN MIGUEL Corporation, the Philippines brewer and industrial group, plans
to issue convertible debt for an expansion and modernisation programme that
will utilise up to 42.5m new shares, equivalent to 7.5 per cent of group
capital.
The company expects to allocate more than 5.0bn pesos (Dollars 180m) this
year for expansion and modernisation. The funds for the programme will come
internally and from external sources - by the flotation of commercial paper,
tapping sources of development funds and through a convertible debt.
San Miguel said the company experienced difficulties last year and faces
more challenges. But the company was confident about the prospects for the
medium and long term. The group's three-year-old expansion programme
remained essentially on schedule, Mr Soriano was quoted as saying. As a
result of the investments then and to come, San Miguel expected to be in a
position to take advantage of opportunities when the economy starts to
recover later this year.
San Miguel recently reported a 26 per cent decline in net profit for 1990 to
1.8bn pesos on turnover of 43.8bn pesos.
SIDMAR of Belgium, the diversified steelmaker, has signed a Dollars 5.8m
three-year contract with STA Software Technologists of the Philippines for
SIDMAR's computer software overhaul.
SIDMAR chose the company after project involving the successful
re-engineering of 232 of the group's programmes.

<TEXT>
SEVEN leading Japanese brokerages have applied to open representative
offices in Taiwan, despite the threat of condemnation from Chinese
authorities in Peking.
The brokerages said that the main objective of the representative offices
will be to collect information, but the official move is likely to be badly
received in Peking, which has already punished the Bank of Tokyo for opening
an office in Taiwan and opposes any increase in official links with Taiwan.
The seven houses are Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities,
Yamaichi Securities, New Japan Securities, Wako Securities and Sanyo
Securities.
An official at one brokerage said that the Japanese securities houses have
already been conducting business in Taiwan through subsidiaries based in
Hong Kong and elsewhere, and that new offices will not change greatly the
substance of their business.
The firms have been selling Japanese equity to Taiwanese investors, and
providing services, such as presenting merger and acquisition information. A
securities house official said that Taiwanese investors who had bought
Japanese stocks before last year's crash in Tokyo had filed complaints that
the lack of official representation had limited their legal rights.
Taiwanese authorities, wanting a means of controlling the operations of the
Japanese houses, demanded that the companies officially file applications to
open offices if they wanted to conduct business in Taiwan.
Peking rejected the Bank of Tokyo's participation in a planned joint venture
finance company last year as a result of opening an office in Taiwan.
The brokerages have been tight-lipped about their operations in Taiwan, but
one official said that China's funding need is expected to limit its
response. China has been sounding out Japanese houses in the hope of issuing
yen bonds in Tokyo.

FT  16 APR 91 / International Bonds: Busy day for sterling new issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ISSUE activity in the international bond market was centred on sterling
yesterday, with four contrasting deals testing demand for floating rate,
subordinated and straight sterling paper.
In the first floating-rate note issue since October last year, Woolwich
Building Society offered Pounds 100m three-year paper lead managed by UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew.
The notes pay a margin of  1/8 point over the three-month London interbank
offered rate, and was reoffered to investors at the fixed price of 99.70. At
this level the paper pays a discounted margin of 25 basis points over Libor,
a small premium over existing deals in the secondary market.
Participants in the deal reported firm demand from UK institutional
investors, although a few houses declined to participate on the grounds that
the fees - 4 basis points for underwriting - were insufficient.
If the deal performs well over the next few days it may open the way for
further floating-rate note issuance by UK building societies, which have
concentrated on fixed-rate funding this year.
National Westminster Bank's Pounds 100m issue of subordinated paper, solely
underwritten by Natwest Capital Markets, was the first 10-year subordinated
issue in sterling since 1988.
The issue counts as Tier II capital for the issuer under the Basle
Guidelines on international bank capital adequacy and other UK banks may
follow if they judge the issue to be a success.
The paper carries an 11 3/4 per cent coupon and was priced to yield a
substantial 135 basis points over the benchmark 10-year gilt.
NatWest reported strong demand from European institutional accounts,
attracted by the high yield on paper rated Aa and AA-2 respectively by
Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's.
Export-Import Bank of Japan came with the first issue by a Japanese
government guaranteed issuer since 1988. The deal was, in part, a positive
response to the Bank of England's decision last month to allow Japanese
banks to act as lead managers on sterling transactions. The borrower also
found an attractive swap arbitrage between sterling and floating rate
dollars.
The Pounds 150m 10-year deal was lead managed by Warburg Securities and
co-lead managed by IBJ. The paper carries a coupon of 10 3/4 per cent and
was priced to yield 46 basis points over the 10 per cent UK government bond
2001.
The yield spread places Ex-Im Bank alongside supranational borrowers such as
the Asian Development Bank. Demand from UK and European institutional
investors ensured rapid placement of the deal, with the yield spread over
gilts closing to 44 basis points by late afternoon.
At the shorter end of the yield curve, Credit Local de France followed its
debut in the sterling sector last month with a Pounds 100m three-year issue
lead managed by Credit Suisse First Boston.
The bonds pay a coupon of 11 per cent and were priced to yield 37 basis
points over the benchmark three-year gilt. The borrowers' Pounds 100m
five-year deal launched last month offered a yield spread of 40 basis points
over UK government paper.
Elsewhere, Japan Finance Corporation for Municipal Enterprises came with a
10-year Dollars 150m deal lead managed by IBJ. The bonds were priced to
yield 50 basis points over US Treasury paper, a pick up of only around 3
basis points over more liquid deals by compar able issuers such as Japan
Development Bank.
However, demand for sovereign-backed dollar paper at this maturity is strong
and from an issue price of 99.25 the paper traded up to 99.40 bid.
Waldner, the Chicago-based risk management group, launched its second
'increasable yield' Ecu bond issue via Swiss Bank Corporation.
The proceeds of the issue are invested by Waldner in futures and options
funds, part of the proceeds of which will be passed on to bond holders. The
bonds pay a minimum coupon of 4 1/2 per cent which may be increased,
depending on Waldner's investment performance.
The issue is backed by a holding of medium-term notes issued by SBC and
carries a triple-A credit rating as a result. The indicated size of the
issue is Ecu50m to Ecu100m. The deal will be priced on May 8.

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN transport group TNT has ended weeks of speculation over its fund
raising prospects by placing 15m shares at ADollars 1.50 apiece with a group
of institutions.
TNT said the ADollars 70m (USDollars 54.8m) proceeds would be used for
'working capital' purposes.
Although the company did not reveal the names of the institutions offered
the shares, it is understood that two were the AMP Society and National
Mutual Life, two recent supporters of TNT in the market.
According to one analyst yesterday's issue would reduce the group's
liquidity problems 'significantly'.
TNT was due to raise ADollars 140m from the exercise of options at a
ADollars 1.60 strike price over May and June, but the recent weakness in the
share price cast doubts on the company's ability to raise the money,
Analysts have blamed TNT's unpopularity on its high debt of ADollars 2.2bn
and its association with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation which suffered
early this year during negotiations with its banks to reschedule Dollars
10bn in borrowings.
In January, TNT shelved plans to issue ADollars 255m worth of preference
shares at about the same time as it was downgraded by the credit agency
Australian Ratings to BBB-minus, barely investment grade.

DFC NZ, the troubled investment bank, yesterday made a NZDollars 600m
(USDollars 353m) payment to large creditors, meaning that NZDollars 1.7bn of
the former government-owned bank's debt of NZDollars 2.2bn has been settled,
writes Terry Hall in Wellington.
DFC's statutory manager, Mr Sandy Maier, said the NZDollars 600m principal
and interest payment was on schedule. He said the level of remaining
payments depended on recoveries from DFC's loan portfolio.
Asset realisations were on target and creditors were being given the highest
anticipated level of principal repayment, said Mr Maier. He added that 77
per cent of DFC's debt and 91 per cent of money owing to its creditors had
been settled.
DFC was placed in statutory management in October 1989. Holders of retail
debt were paid off last August, and remaining creditors were split into
holders of first, second and third-tier debt.
Mr Maier said 300 creditors were still to be paid. The repayment funds are
coming from property asset sales.

FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Westpac branch may be saved

WESTPAC Banking Corporation, Australia's biggest bank, appears set to
reverse a decision to close its Seoul branch after reaching agreement with
unions in South Korea to end a seven-month strike.
The agreement is expected to be signed today. Mr Choi Dong Soo, chief
manager of the Westpac branch in Seoul, is to recommend to Westpac's board
that it change its decision to close the branch. A manager at the bank said
that approval to stay open would be 'a formality'.
The central issue in the dispute - the powers of the union in a personnel
committee which would participate in hiring and disciplinary decisions -
appears to have been resolved in favour of management.
Under the agreement, the chief manager of the bank will be chairman of the
personnel committee and cast the deciding vote in cases of deadlock on the
eight-member body. Earlier the union had rejected granting management the
deciding vote.
'We think this is a big concession,' said an official at the bank, but
added: 'We were not prepared to give up control on this fundamental issue of
management rights.'
A manager at a European bank in Seoul welcomed the decision.
He said it demonstrated that unreasonable wage and managerial demands by
unions were not sustainable and would influence unions at other foreign
banks in Seoul.
The strike was marred by allegations of violence by both sides. Striking
workers also blasted music through loudspeakers placed outside the bank in
an attempt to disrupt business.

FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Profits tumble by 22% at
Israel's third largest bank

IDB BANKHOLDING, Israel's third largest financial group whose ownership
structure is currently the subject of controversial negotiations with the
government, yesterday reported a steep profits slide.
For 1990, net profits fell 22 per cent to Shk66m (Dollars 32.5m at end-1990
exchange rates) from Shk85m in 1989.
The reversal was largely due to a downturn in performance in its core
banking business, Israel Discount Bank. Tight margins, the failure of Shekel
devaluation against the dollar to match domestic inflation, an increased tax
charge and a fall in contributions from subsidiaries were blamed for a 21
per cent tumble in IDB net profits, from Shk75.3m to Shk59.2m.
Performance at the group's investment arm, IDB Development - one of the
richest private investment portfolios in Israel - also slipped, with net
profits down to Shk60m from Shk64m, although this was put down mainly to a
windfall cancellation of a tax provision which inflated profits in 1989.
For the group as a whole, total assets were down slightly to Shk35.8bn from
Shk37.2bn, shareholders equity was up at Shk1.79bn from Shk1.76bn and return
on equity was 3.8 per cent, compared with 4.9 per cent in 1989.
The main issue facing IDB is settling its ownership. Mr Raphael Recanati,
IDB chairman, yesterday called on the government to resolve the issue
quickly. As with Israel's three other main banks, the government bought a
majority shareholding in 1983 to rescue it from a share price collapse, but
control was left in the hands of the Recanati family.
A government effort to sell a controlling stake through a competitive
tender, following an agreement with the Recanatis to abandon the
preferential voting structure, collapsed when the only bidder other than the
family dropped out.
The Bank of Israel then said it objected to reselling the group to the
Recanatis, who face criminal charges from a share manipulation scandal that
prompted the 1983 collapse.
At present the government appears ready to proceed with the sale despite the
central bank's intervention.

12 in bid rejection

COAL AND Allied Industries, the Australian coal group, has predicted
earnings of ADollars 55.2m (USDollars 43m) for the year ending June 1990 and
values its shares at ADollars 12 a share in its formal rejection of the
ADollars 7.85 a share takeover offer from CRA, the resources group.
In their formal response to the CRA offer, which values Cail at ADollars
437m, the directors claimed that shareholders speaking for 52 per cent of
the company's capital had indicated they would not accept the bid.
These shareholders include three major customers of Cail's export coal: Ube
Industries, Nissho Iwai Corporation and Joban Kosan Company, all of Japan.
The rejection by the Cail board puts pressure on CRA to increase its offer
if it is to be seen as a serious bidder. This is CRA's second attempt to
take control of Cail, Australia's third largest coal mining group. It made
an unsuccessful bid in 1979.
CRA may also be forced to lift its offer because most of the institutions
which picked up the 37 per cent of Cail sold into the market last year by
shipping and resources group Howard Smith paid more than ADollars 9 a share.
Cail shares closed 4 cents lower yesterday at ADollars 8.26 after briefly
hitting ADollars 8.36 on the release of the board's recommendation.
Although CRA is known mostly for its iron ore and base metals interests, it
is also a significant coal mining business.

Australia on ADollars 259m loss

<TEXT>
SECURITY PACIFIC National Bank of the US has injected ADollars 236m
(USDollars 184m) of capital into its subsidiary, Security Pacific Australia
(Spal), after the Australian merchant bank ran up 1990 losses of ADollars
259m.
This loss took the combined deficit of Australian subsidiaries of foreign
banks over the latest reporting period to more than ADollars 1bn. The
largest loss was ADollars 273m, incurred by Hong Kong Bank of Australia.
Spal's recently appointed chairman, Mr Richard Keller, said the 1990 result
was 'obviously disappointing'.
Spal was forced to make large provisions of ADollars 232m on a small number
of problem loans, mainly its ADollars 100m exposure to the collapsed Girvan
property group and Linter Textiles of Mr Abe Goldberg.
The four main Australian banks were able to wrap up most of the best
corporate business before the 17 foreign banks were admitted in 1985, so the
newcomers were forced to increase aggressively their lending to borrowers
that the domestic banks avoided.

THE Venezuelan government has sold Banco Italo Venezolano, an ailing
state-owned commercial bank, to a Venezuelan financial group for the
equivalent of USDollars 63.8m, writes Joe Mann in Caracas.
The buyer is Banco Hipotecario de Falcon, a mortgage bank which headed a
consortium of three financial groups from the west of the country.
The buyers have to apply about Dollars 50m to restore the capital base of
Banco Italo and to cover bad loans. The remaining Dollars 13m is to be paid
to the government as a 'premium' for acquiring the bank.
Banco Italo has been in trouble for several years due to a host of
uncollectable loans.

FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: European sales lift CPC 6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN sales and profit gains helped offset recessionary conditions in the
US, and allowed CPC International, the food company which takes in Hellman's
Mayonnaise and Ambrosia custard, to post a modest 6 per cent earnings
advance in the first quarter.
CPC reported earnings per share of Dollars 1.07 during the three months to
end-March, up from Dollars 1.01 in the same period a year earlier. Worldwide
sales rose by 12 per cent, from Dollars 1.35bn to Dollars 1.52bn, while
after-tax profits clocked in at Dollars 83.4m, against Dollars 78.9m.
CPC said it believed the worst of the North American recession was over, but
conceded this had affected Best Foods, its US consumer foods business.
Economic problems in Argentina and Brazil also hit operations in South
America, and CPC expects these difficulties to persist into the second
quarter.
However, the European operations fared well - showing a 41 per cent sales
advance and a 78 per cent improvement in operating income.
The advances result partly from acquisitions - CPC bought the UK Ambrosia,
Marmite and Bovril businesses last year, together with Mateus jams and
jellies in Portugal, and Heidelberg salad dressings in Denmark  - but the
company also stressed there had been good volume growth.
