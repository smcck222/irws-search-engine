FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: US Home files for Chapter 11
protection
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
US HOME Corporation, the troubled Houston-based housebuilder, yesterday
filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code - after
months of negotiations with its bankers failed to achieve a debt
restructuring.
During recent months, Home, one of the largest housebuilders in the US, has
been trying to win the agreement of 17 banks for a restructuring of a
Dollars 156m unsecured revolving credit facility. Discussions have been
under way for almost one year.
Yesterday, US Home said the necessary unanimous agreement among the banks
could not be attained, and it considered that 'an acceptable debt
restructuring could best be achieved' through Chapter 11. It declined to say
how close it came to agreement with the banking group, or where the
obstacles lay.
The Houston housebuilder has secured an additional Dollars 65m-plus of
funds, through debtor-in-possession financing. This is often made available
when a company files for Chapter 11, with the new lenders ranking well to
the front of the repayment queue. This, according to Home, 'will provide
additional funding for the homebuilding operations during the time needed
for the restructuring'.
Home built about 4,800 units last year, and ranks within the top 10 US
housebuilding groups. In recent years, the company has been attempting to
cut costs, but its figures have still been affected by write-offs and
litigation over houses built more than a decade ago. In 1990, the company
saw sales of Dollars 610m, but made a net loss of Dollars 101m after
write-offs.

FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: First City Financial in 1990
loss of CDollars 228m

FIRST CITY Financial, the core holding company of Vancouver's Belzberg
family, has reported a final 1990 loss of CDollars 228.1m (USDollars 197.3m)
or CDollars 4.35 a share, due to unsuccessful efforts to take control of
several prominent companies, including the British supermarket group Asda.
The Belzbergs became prominent North American corporate raiders in the
1980s, often through First City Financial. They have withdrawn from
securities trading and arbitrage since the end of the year and the group is
concentrating on its financial services subsidiary and property operations
in Canada and the US.
Mr Samuel Belzberg, best known as a 'greenmailer' in the 1980s, last month
stepped aside as chief executive of First City Financial and his nephew,
Brent, 40, took over. Now Mr Brent Belzberg has been appointed chairman of
the trust company subsidiary.
Revenues for all 1990 were CDollars 786m, down from 1989's CDollars 970m.
Total assets at December 31 were CDollars 5.5bn against CDollars 6bn a year
earlier.
In 1989 First City Financial reported earnings of CDollars 61m or CDollars
1.13 a share, excluding a CDollars 123.7m gain from the sale of its
investment in Cantel, a cellular telephone company.
Mr Brent Belzberg said the priorities were debt reduction and restructuring,
sale of non-core assets and a simplified corporate structure.
He agreed shareholder value has been eroded 'significantly' by the 1990
loss. Nearly CDollars 1bn of securities have been sold, offices closed in
Britain and Barbados, and cutbacks made in New York and Vancouver.
The company's Canadian lenders have agreed to convert CDollars 100m of
demand bank credit lines into a three-year term loan. But much of First City
Financial's underlying value is represented by property and shares of the
trust company subsidiary, he said, and further debt restructuring was
needed.
A US subsidiary lacks sufficient liquidity to redeem USDollars 97m of senior
notes due in mid May, and restructuring talks are under way.

advance strongly to Dollars 26m

<TEXT>
SAFEWAY, the US food retailer which was taken private via a Dollars 4.2bn
leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 1986, yesterday reported
after-tax profits of Dollars 26.7m in the three months to March 23. This
compares with Dollars 15m in the same period in 1990.
However, operating profits improved by a smaller percentage - up 10 per
cent, at Dollars 122.8m - while sales were less than 2 per cent higher at
Dollars 3.4bn (Dollars 3.34bn). Operating margin advanced from 3.3 per cent
to 3.6 per cent.
Part of the gain in net profits came from Vons, a supermarket chain in
California, in which Safeway has a 35 per cent equity investment.
Safeway records income from the Vons investment on a one-quarter delay
basis, and said that increased profits from this source lay behind a
near-doubling of 'other income' in its own results last quarter, from
Dollars 8.2m to Dollars 15m.
Interest charges in the three-month period increased slightly, from Dollars
83.8m to Dollars 86.5m.
Safeway, which takes in over 1,100 outlets in the US and Canada, said that,
despite the 'soft sales' recorded in the first quarter, it viewed the
results as 'excellent'.
The company, still highly-leveraged, earlier this month increased the size
of an international share offering from 2m to 3.5m shares, following demand
from UK institutions.
The international tranche was part of a 17.5m share offering, representing
18 per cent of the company's enlarged share capital.

MR BO LUNDQUIST, executive vice-president at the Swedish mining and
industrial group Trelleborg, will become president and chief executive of
Esselte, the office products company, writes John Burton in Stockholm.
His appointment follows the decision last month by Mr Rune Andersson, the
Trelleborg chairman, to head the Esselte board of directors. He also
acquired an option for a 21 per cent voting stake, which would make him the
biggest shareholder, through his private company Gettinge Intressenter.
Esselte's new leadership yesterday emphasised that there were no plans for
Trelleborg to become directly involved in the troubled office products
group. Mr Kjell Nilsson, Trelleborg president, declined an invitation to
join the Esselte board to underline this. Mr Lundquist denied speculation
that Mr Andersson planned to break up the company and sell its divisions to
gain quick returns from his investment.

FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Mondadori replaces managing
director
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR FRANCO Tato, a former top executive of Olivetti, the Italian computers
group controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, is to be the new managing
director of Mondadori, the media concern subject to a control battle between
Mr De Benedetti and Mr Silvio Berlusconi.
Mr Tato, who shifted to the Berlusconi camp soon after he left Olivetti in
October, is to replace Mr Corrado Passera, the close De Benedetti aide who
became Mondadori's top executive after Mr De Benedetti regained control of
the group last July.
Since then, the pendulum has swung firmly back Mr Berlusconi's way, thanks
to a number of court decisions which have progressively loosened Mr De
Benedetti's control of the company, despite continuing legal efforts on his
part to reassert his grip.
That process culminated in the election yesterday of a new 15-member board,
10 of whom allied members of the Mondadori and Formenton families, against
five for the De Benedetti side.
Meanwhile, there is more speculation about the chances of a negotiated
settlement of the Mondadori dispute. This follows the recent intervention of
Mr Giuseppe Ciarrapico, a leading Rome-based entrepreneur closely associated
with Mr Giulio Andreotti, the prime minister.
Mr Ciarrapico has reinvigorated the idea of a division of the group between
the De Benedetti and Berlusconi sides, with a financial settlement based on
the differing values of the assets assumed.
As before, the plan involves the transfer to Mr De Benedetti's CIR holding
company of La Repubblica, Italy's biggest-selling newspaper, and L'Espresso,
a leading news magazine.
The deal could also include Panorama, the country's top-selling news
magazine, and a chain of local newspapers.
According to Mr Passera, who always stresses the damage being done to
Mondadori by the uncertainty over its fate, the chances of an easy
settlement should not be exaggerated.
As in last summer's abortive talks on a deal, agreeing to a figure for the
settlement may again prove the stumbling block. Despite Mr Ciarrapico's good
offices and the idea of tossing more small parts of the group into the pot
to make the deal cheaper, a gulf may still remain between the two sides'
conception of what constitutes a fair settlement.

FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Perrier wins trickle from a
Catalan source
</HEADLINE>

   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH may not have won a battle this important in Spain since they took
Barcelona in the War of the Spanish Succession 277 years ago.
A Catalan court has ruled that the French mineral water giant, Perrier, had
a rightful claim to a small fee for every litre of water sold by the only
producer of naturally carbonated water outside of France, Vichy Catalan.
Although Perrier will earn a mere Dollars 1,040 a year from the ruling, the
victory is an important legal foothold from which to press its attack on
Europe's fastest growing mineral water market. It has taken the French much
of this century to break through the Catalan defences.
The story begins in 1881, when a Catalan doctor, Modest Furest i Roca,
discovered a spring near Gerona whose waters resembled those he had once
enjoyed in Vichy, France. His enthusiasm for the bicarbonated waters
persuaded some Catalan businessmen to back his plans to bottle it.
Furest apparently registered the name Vichy in Spain first. Today the
company is the biggest supplier of fizzy and still mineral waters in Spain.
Since Perrier took over management of Vichy Celestins more than 40 years ago
it has tried desperately to enter the Spanish market with a vichy water.
Catalan courts have handed down victory after victory to the home team.
In 1988, however, the stalking French managed to buy about 6 per cent of
Vichy Catalan from one of the five Furest descendants, for about Dollars
2.5m. Since then it has argued in the courts that it has a right to the
canon each of the descendants gets on a litre of Vichy Catalan sold (one
fifth of a peseta per litre) and to inspect production.
Last year a lower court in Barcelona would not admit the acquisition. But
Perrier appealed and, though the higher court would not allow it to inspect
production, it has recognised the right to a share of the sales.
Vichy Catalan is saying nothing.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCHNEIDER, the French electrical equipment group, yesterday claimed further
progress in its unsolicited Dollars 1.8bn bid for control of Square D, the
US maker of electrical distribution equipment.
The French bidder said 78.1 per cent of Square D's shares had been tendered
to its initial Dollars 78-a-share cash offer, 10 per cent more than the
number achieved by the first deadline, at the end of March. Schneider has
decided to extend the offer until May 3.
'An imposing majority of Square D shareholders has once again responded
favourably to our offer . . . Better still, we have registered a very clear
progression in the number of shares being offered to us,' said Mr Didier
Pineau-Valencienne, Schneider's chairman.
Square D is based in Illinois but registered in Delaware to take advantage
of Delaware state laws requiring a bidder to control 85 per cent of the
capital before claiming victory.
'In refusing to cancel the obstacles to this transaction and to meet us to
discuss our offer, the board of Square D is neglecting the will of its
shareholders,' said Mr Pineau-Valencienne.
The French group launched its bid in February, when it became clear that
discussions with Square D on an agreed merger were coming to nothing.
Schneider has now asked shareholders to give it their proxy votes for Square
D's annual general meeting on May 25, at which it will try to oust the US
company's board and replace it with its candidates.
'In giving us their mandate, Square D's shareholders will give us the means
to bring about an operation which serves their interests just as much as the
long term industrial interests of Square D,' said Mr Pineau-Valencienne.

<TEXT>
APPLE COMPUTER'S share price fell by more than Dollars 10 yesterday to
Dollars 61 1/2 at midday from a Friday close of Dollars 71 3/4 when the
personal computer manufacturer reported disappointing second-quarter
results.
Net income declined slightly to Dollars 131.1m from Dollars 131.8m in the
second quarter a year ago, while per-share earnings increased to Dollars
1.07 from Dollars 1.04. Analysts had been predicting per-share income of
about Dollars 1.17.
Net revenues for the quarter grew to Dollars 1.6bn, up 23 per cent from
Dollars 1.3bn last year.
Apple said that shipments of its popular Macintosh personal computers rose
about 85 per cent compared with the same quarter a year ago.
International revenues accounted for 52 per cent of total revenues, marking
the first time Apple has raised more than half of its revenues outside the
US.
It was, however, the decline in Apple's much vaunted gross margins - to 48.8
per cent from 54.7 per cent - that raised alarm among financial analysts.
The decline brings into question Apple's strategy of increasing its share of
the personal computer market by offering lower-priced versions of its
Macintosh personal computers, albeit at lower profit margins.
Apple maintained, however, that the decline in profit margins was expected.
'Our operating results demonstrate our ability to effectively manage the
changing economics of our business.
'Our selling expenses grew just one third as fast as revenues, and we
reduced our total operating expenses as a percentage of sales,'said Mr John
Sculley, chairman and chief executive.
'We are very pleased with our second-quarter results. We saw strong demand
for our new lower-priced products, and as a result, we experienced renewed
growth in our US business and continued strength in our international
sales.'
Apple is expected to launch a new range of 'notebook' portable computers
this year.
For the six-month period, Apple's net income was Dollars 281.7m, or Dollars
2.35 per share, up from Dollars 256.7m or Dollars 2.00 last time. Revenues
rose to Dollars 3.3bn from Dollars 2.8bn.

<TEXT>
CHASE MANHATTAN, which seemed just six months ago to be among the most
critically ill of the US retail banks, has bounced back with a near-trebling
of first-quarter earnings.
North America's second largest banking group posted net income of Dollars
117m, or 73 cents a share, up from Dollars 44m, or 20 cents a share, a year
earlier.
Lower funding costs and an increase in high-margin consumer lending pushed
up net interest income to Dollars 841m, from Dollars 814m. Fees and
commissions rose by 8 per cent to Dollars 380m, including a 25 per cent jump
in consumer banking charges.
Although non-performing loans continue to loom large in the bank's business,
Chase's chairman Mr Tom Labrecque said he was 'encouraged' by the latest
results.
Analysts were especially heartened by the improved control over operating
expenses, which fell by 2 per cent to Dollars 936m.
Total assets slipped to Dollars 100.5bn from Dollars 107.3bn. However,
return on both assets and shareholders' equity improved markedly, in the
latter case from 2.3 to 10.1 per cent.
Although Chase's earnings were roughly in line with recent forecasts, its
share price climbed 88 cents to Dollars 18.50 yesterday on the New York
stock exchange. The share price is now almost double the low reached last
year when the group sharply cut its dividend to reflect spiralling loan
losses, especially in US real estate.
Mr Stephen Berman, banking analyst at County NatWest in New York, said
yesterday that 'there is some light at the end of the tunnel. Their problems
don't seem to be totally out of control'.
Chase had mixed news regarding problem loans. On the one hand, non-accrual
commercial real estate loans continued to mount, rising to Dollars 2.1bn on
March 31, from Dollars 1.8bn last December and Dollars 884m a year ago.
Other domestic non-accrual loans climbed to Dollars 761m from Dollars 723m
last December.
Non-accrual loans now stand at 4.9 per cent of assets, compared to 4.6 per
cent three months ago, and 3.8 per cent last year.
However, the rate of increase in loan write-offs slowed - and in some types
of business was reversed - during the first quarter.
Loan-loss provisions were Dollars 240m, up from Dollars 225m a year earlier.
Actual loan write-offs, net of recoveries, totalled Dollars 270m, down from
Dollars 325m. The latest figure includes Dollars 19m in write-offs on third
world debt refinancings compared to Dollars 191m a year earlier.
Compared to the previous three months, write-offs on domestic commercial
real estate and other non-consumer loans fell slightly in the latest
quarter. However they remain far higher than a year ago.
Losses on consumer loans continued to rise, reaching Dollars 112m in the
latest quarter, up from Dollars 106m three months earlier.

<TEXT>
SELM, the power generating subsidiary of Italy's Montedison group, reported
group net profits of L92.3bn (Dollars 74m) last year against L132.8bn in
1989. However, extraordinary items in 1989 inflated group earnings, the
company said.
In 1989, the sale of activities to the Enimont chemicals joint venture then
owned by Montedison and state-owned Eni, generated a capital gain of
L90.1bn. Those divisions made net profits of L26.3bn that year.
Adjusted for the disposals, group net earnings in 1989 amounted to L16.3bn,
according to Montedison. Sales last year rose 5 per cent to L486.3bn from an
adjusted L462.9bn.
Selm, which specialises in hydro-electric power and has some
thermally-generated electricity, is planning to change its name to Edison,
the former title of the private electricity group from which Selm stems. The
company is paying a dividend of L70 and L90 for each ordinary and savings
share respectively.

BUOYANT demand for quarry products lifted pre-tax profits at Alexander
Russell to Pounds 3.06m for the year 1990, from the Pounds 2.11m of the
previous nine months.
The latest profits included an exceptional gain of Pounds 1.05m from land
sales.
Below the line there was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.14m for the
running down of US and UK coal operations and premature closure of a UK coal
site.
Turnover for the year was Pounds 38.76m (Pounds 32.67m), with a record
Pounds 18m from quarrying sales, up 15 per cent, but a 10 per cent decline
in concrete products.
From fully diluted earnings per share of 7.76p (4.38p) the final dividend is
1.15p for a total of 2.15p (1.61p for nine months).
Mr Russell Nicolson, chairman, forecast increased profits as the costly
retrenchment of coal operations neared completion and the group expanded its
more profitable quarrying and roof-tile manufacturing activities.

THE FIRST large property letting in the City of London this year has been
achieved by MEPC, the property developer and investor, which has pre-let its
125,000 sq ft office development at Finsbury Circus to the Bank of Toyko.
Another big letting deal has been announced by Markheath Securities, which
has pre-let 140,000 sq ft of offices in Brentford, West London to SmithKline
Beecham, the healthcare group, for an annual rent of about Pounds 3.7m.
The weakness of the London property market was reflected in MEPC's agreement
to take on the Bank of Toyko's existing lease of 80,000 sq ft in Northgate
House in Moorgate. However, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the letting agents, said
that the terms of the deal should be an encouragement to the market.
The rent, which was undisclosed, was said to reflect the high quality of the
development. MEPC was originally quoting rents early last year of over
Pounds 60 per square foot.
The Bank of Toyko will move into the building next spring. It will sub-let
the top two floors of the building, which total 25,600 sq ft.

THE GLENEAGLES Group, part of the Guinness conglomerate, is to invest more
than IPounds 60m, or Pounds 53.6m sterling, in a leisure complex in the
Republic of Ireland.
The complex - to be built on an estate demesne at Maynooth, 15 miles from
Dublin - will be modelled on the Gleneagles Hotel in Perthshire and will
include two 18-hole championship golf courses, a 200-room hotel, 119 'golf
villas' and 29 'corporate lodges'.
The Gleneagles Group plans to operate 10 similar establishments worldwide.
Several projects are at present underway in Ireland to develop so-called
executive leisure centres.
Later this year Straffan House, an international conference centre and
country club developed by a consortium headed by Mr Michael Smurfit, of the
paper and packaging group, will open near Dublin.
International Conference Resort, a private US group, is planning to build an
IPounds 40m conference centre near Shannon in the south-west of Ireland.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Midland in deal with Japanese card issuer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland Bank has signed an agreement with JCB, the Japanese charge card
company, to handle its retail business in the UK.
The deal opens the way for JCB, the largest charge card company in Japan to
increase its network of retailers from 10,000 to 50,000 by 1995.
At present JCB's UK business is almost entirely confined to the 500,000
Japanese tourists and business travellers who visit the UK each year.
However, the company last year announced plans to become a card issuer in
the US and UK, a move which will eventually bring it into direct competition
with American Express and Diners Club.
One problem JCB faces in trying to expand its UK retailnetwork is that many
retailers hate the high commissions required by charge cards. American
Express has an average commission of about 4 per cent, compared to about 1.6
per cent for Visa or MasterCard.
A new player in the market such as JCB would face higher costs and so
probably have to ask retailers for a commission well above this. However,
large retailers could decide that this was worth-paying in order to attract
business from high-spending Japanese customers.

Citibank Savings, the UK retail banking arm of Citicorp, is to shut its
loss-making UK car loans operation with the loss of over 50 jobs.
The closure is the latest of a series of withdrawals by large lenders from
the asset finance market. In January Bank of Ireland said that it was
winding down British Credit Trust, its finance house subsidiary.
Mr Jack Davies, Managing Director Citibank Savings, said: 'The auto finance
business has been a marginal operation for us for a number of years and the
losses experienced by a number of people in the credit industry was really
what led to our decision to close it.'
Mr Davies confirmed that the car loans operation had been losing money but
denied claims that losses reached Pounds 12m last year.
At the same time Citibank Savings is beefing up other parts of its consumer
finance operations, especially mortgage lending and home improvements. These
activities will now make up a new division of Citibank Savings called
Citibank Home Loans.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Pounds 211,000 for Venturi in its first
year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In its first set of annual results, Venturi Investment Trust made Pounds
211,170 after tax in the year to March 31. This represents earnings per
share of 3.52p.
As forecast in the prospectus of March 1990 the proposed final dividend is
1.7475p to make a total of 3.06p.
The net asset value of the capital indexed shares at the year-end was
245.65p, up some 11 per cent; of the income shares 25.46p (25p); and of the
ordinary geared shares 9.38p undiluted and 8.93p diluted, 94 and 85 per cent
ahead respectively.
Mr Simon Dawson Eccles, chairman, said: 'Though never to the exclusion of
current income requirements, we strive to get the assets to at least match
the market, as cumulative outperformance to date is there to enhance all
future years' income flow and growth.'

Fuchs, the family-controlled German lubricants group, said that it held more
than 30 per cent of Century Oils, the UK lubricants company, following its
increased offer of 145p last Wednesday and had launched a full bid under
takeover rules.
Before the improved bid from 110p, Fuchs owned 13.4 per cent of Century's
shares and bought an additional 7 per cent in the market as soon as it
increased its offer.
All other conditions of the offer have been waived.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: French Connection returns to the black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
French Connection, the USM-quoted fashion manufacturer and retailer,
returned to pre-tax profit in the second half of 1990-91, making Pounds
277,000, and expects further improvement in the current year.
Together with the first half loss, the group is left with a profit of Pounds
57,000 for the year ended January 31, against the previous deficit of Pounds
4.67m.
Net interest charges were cut by Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.24m as bank
borrowings fell from Pounds 6.1m to Pounds 4.6m by the year-end.
Earnings were 1.4p per share (losses 29.7p). The dividend is again 2.7p with
a recommended final of 1.8p. The cost is Pounds 95,000 (Pounds 96,000) after
directors' waivers totalling Pounds 334,000.
Turnover for the year rose to Pounds 56.68m (Pounds 53.31m). That generated
an operating profit of Pounds 1.3m (loss Pounds 4.19m), struck after losses
of Pounds 410,000 (Pounds 1.16m) in the US and Pounds 710,000 (Pounds
50,000) in France.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sunset &amp; Vine, the independent television production company involved in
sponsored sports programmes, reported a 25 per cent fall in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 330,000 to Pounds 246,000 in the six months to end-December.
Turnover in the period was up 46 per cent to Pounds 1.88m (Pounds 1.29m) but
the outcome was affected by an increase in the cost of sales to Pounds 1.25m
(Pounds 768,000) and greater administrative expenses of Pounds 497,000
(Pounds 335,000). There was also a decline in interest receivable to Pounds
108,000 (Pounds 145,000).
The group moved up to the main market from the USM in September, and an
extraordinary charge of Pounds 77,000 (nil) represents the expenses
incurred.
The interim dividend is unchanged at 1.5p and comes from earnings per share
of 3p (4.3p).

<TEXT>
Taxable profits at Headlam Group, the Northampton-based footwear and fabrics
group which fought off an attempted management coup last April, were halved
to Pounds 458,000 in the year to December 31, 'a difficult trading period',
according to Mr Colin Wyman, chairman.
Turnover rose to Pounds 23.25m (Pounds 22.87m), but heightened competition
for business saw trading profits slip to Pounds 1.01m (Pounds 1.32m).
Interest took Pounds 133,000 more at Pounds 391,000 and there was an
exceptional charge of Pounds 158,000 (Pounds 130,000) relating to the
reorganisation of Phipps-Faire, the textile and plastic materials
distributor.
Earnings were down at 2.9p (6p) but the proposed final is maintained at
1.65p for an unchanged total of 2.4p. Group borrowings were reduced to
Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 2.47m), in spite of the Pounds 210,000 extraordinary
costs of the extraordinary general meeting and the abortive acquisition of
Cadogan Oakley.

As trading losses at Olympic Containers, its composite container subsidiary,
rose from Pounds 176,000 to Pounds 844,000, Belfast-based Finlay Packaging
finished 1990 with a loss of Pounds 576,000, compared to a profit of Pounds
270,000.
At the halfway mark the deficit was Pounds 300,000.
Reflecting confidence in the core activities, however, the directors are
recommending a final dividend; it is 0.75p for a total of 1.5p, against 4p,
from losses per share of 5.26p (earnings 2.02p).
Olympic is being run down for closure on May 3, in view of the losses and no
possibility of recovery. A provision of Pounds 650,000 is being made against
further losses and cost of closure; along with Pounds 120,000 costs arising
from litigation against the vendors of Olympic, that makes up a Pounds
770,000 extraordinary provision.
Turnover for the year was Pounds 11.16m (Pounds 11.05m) of which
discontinuing activities accounted for Pounds 2.34m (Pounds 2.57m).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Southern Water has arranged a Pounds 55m loan facility with the European
Investment Bank, the second and final tranche of a Pounds 95m funding
programme agreed in September last year.
The 15-year facility will be used to finance Southern's capital expenditure
programme, which currently absorbs around Pounds 3m a week. Many of the
projects being funded are required under UK and European Community
legislation.
The interest rate will not be fixed until the funds are drawn down by
Southern. The company pays a fixed 11 per cent interest on the initial
Pounds 40m loan arranged last year.
In common with many other UK water companies, Southern has opted to finance
capital expenditure through the EIB rather than borrow from the capital
markets in it's own name.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Lower interest lifts S Lyles to Pounds
316,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Substantially lower interest charges helped S Lyles, the yarn spinner and
dyer, to increase pre-tax profit from Pounds 301,000 to Pounds 316,000 in
the half-year ended December 31 1990.
Turnover fell from Pounds 9.82m to Pounds 8.58m, a reflection of both the
volume of business and lower commodity prices, said Mr John Lyles, the
chairman.
The quality of business, however, remained high, he said, and 'we now sense
there is a feeling of gradual recovery in the air'.
Earnings per share in the half-year came to 2.64p (2.51p) and the interim
dividend is again 1.5p.
The company is seeking authority to purchase its ordinary shares, and repay
the preference shares at par. An extraordinary general meeting has been
called for May 13.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Asda Prop declines to Pounds 1.4m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER HOUSE prices, high interest rates and a lack of new trading
opportunities in 1990 depressed pre-tax profits at Asda Property Holdings -
they fell from Pounds 5.25m to Pounds 1.4m in the year to December 31.
Mr Manny Davidson, chairman, said that in his 40 years in the property
business, he had not witnessed a more severe downturn than that which
happened in 1990. Consequently he said he was pleased with the 39 per cent
growth in net rental income to Pounds 10.2m and the 'resilient' sales from
the residential portfolio totalling some Pounds 14.5m.
Trading profits were only down to Pounds 15.21m (Pounds 16.62m) while an
exceptional charge debited Pounds 812,000, for rationalisation and
write-downs, and interest took Pounds 13.81m (Pounds 11.37m). Earnings per
share worked out at 2p (5.2p) and the final dividend is lifted to a proposed
1.25 (1.15p) for a total of 1.85p (1.75p). The fully diluted net asset value
at the year-end was 144p (197p).

FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: What Everyone Wants boosts Amber Day
profits to Pounds 5.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMBER DAY, the fashion retail group, yesterday reported a sharp increase in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.52m in the six months to January after the
acquisition last June of What Everyone Wants, the Northern and Scottish
discount shopping chain.
The profit compared with Pounds 1.31m, and was achieved on sales up Pounds
44.82m at Pounds 55.45m.
Earnings per share rose 84 per cent to 3.86p (2.1p) and the interim dividend
is increased to 0.9p (0.7p).
Mr Philip Green, the chairman, said that the What Everyone Wants
value-for-money formula had proved profitable and resilient in the
recessionary climate, and the management had successfully improved gross
margins.
The interest charge rose to Pounds 1.5m on debt that last year-end stood at
Pounds 23m at which time the company had a negative net worth of Pounds
5.6m.
Debt is expected to fall Pounds 6-7m by the financial year-end, depending on
whether the company sells a department store site in Glasgow, where planning
permission has recently been granted, and on the level of year-end stocks.
Operating profit from retailing accounted for Pounds 7.17m and should reach
Pounds 12m for the full year, brokers said.
The Review and Woodhouse menswear businesses, which constituted the core of
Amber Day's activity ahead of the What Everyone Wants acquisition, suffered
from the recession, particularly in the south of England, and contributed
only Pounds 400,000.
During the period Mr Gerald Weisfeld, who founded What Everyone Wants with
his wife and built the 37 store group, resigned as chairman after a
disagreement over the future direction of the company.
Mr and Mrs Weisfeld sold their combined 17 per cent stake in Amber Day in
February and severed all links including non-executive roles.
The group planned to continue its acquisition of cheap leaseholds mainly
from receivers, its brokers said. This was unlikely to have a
large impact on cash flow as the company never paid more than 'peanuts' for
its leases.
It would confine its acquisitions to the north of England and to Scotland,
where it could control growth, and was unlikely to spread south of
Warwickshire.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Brent Walker shares rise 8p on confirmation
of Power deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT WALKER, the heavily-indebted leisure group, yesterday announced the
appointment of a new group managing director and confirmed the proposed swap
of its stake in the Trocadero leisure development in London's Piccadilly
Circus.
Brent Walker's shares rose 8p to 71p. However, Brent Walker has yet to
detail how the deal will affect its balance sheet. It is likely to result in
a substantial reduction in the group's net assets, perhaps by Pounds 100m,
and will not of itself reduce debt, although it will remove potential costs
involved in developing the Trocadero site.
The new managing director is Mr Nicholas Ward, who is 49 and has a
reputation for being tough and competent, but has been involved in boardroom
rows in the past. His appointment is the final part of the board's
reconstruction following the standstill agreement reached between the group
and its banks last autumn.
Mr Ward was previously chairman and chief executive of Macarthy, the
pharmaceutical manufacturer and retailer, but resigned in July 1989 after a
boardroom dispute. He is still pursuing Macarthy for compensation, although
last August it paid him Pounds 140,000 net of tax as an interim payment.
Brent Walker and Power Corporation, the Republic of Ireland-based property
developer, have signed a conditional agreement untying the two groups' 50-50
ownership of three properties. The deal will swap Brent Walker's half-shares
in the Trocadero and the Tower Shopping Centre in Blackpool, for the
half-share Power owns in the Island site, a 1.3-acre site next to the
Trocadero. The Island site is thought to be worth about Pounds 70m, but
Brent Walker will take about Pounds 60m of debt with it.
Mr Robin Power, chairman and chief executive of Power Corporation, said he
hoped to finalise the deal by the end of this week or early next. However,
Brent Walker's banks have to give consent to the deal, and yesterday were
awaiting more detailed information on it. They may take longer to study it.
Analysts suggested that Power Corporation appeared to have the better part
of the deal, since the Trocadero - which should be producing annual rents of
Pounds 16m by the end of this year once completed - and Blackpool properties
are potentially more valuable than the Island site.
However Brent Walker has a more urgent need for cash than Power, and the
Island site, which covers about 40 properties, can be more readily sold.
It can demonstrate to its banks, with which it is discussing a Pounds 1.4bn
refinancing, that it can make disposals which should more than meet a
promise to raise Pounds 50m through asset sales by the end of 1991.
Mr Power said the deal would remove a conflict of interest between the two
parties, as Brent Walker had been keen to sell the development or properties
within it while Power was prepared to hold out for higher prices later on.
He said the deal 'suits us and it suits their present position'.
Power Corporation plans to keep the 50 per cent stake in the joint venture
it is taking from Brent Walker distinct so that it could bring in another
partner later.

EFG has set May 9 as the date for an extraordinary general meeting called by
dissenting shareholders who object to the group's divestment from the
forestry management business, writes Steven Watkins.
The agenda for the EGM includes motions calling for the removal of Mr Alan
Joynes, chief executive, and the declaration of a dividend.
Cazenove, EFG's advisers, said the dissenting shareholders were lead by Mr
Michael Chambers, who controls 6 per cent of the company's stock, personally
and through his company New Forest Holdings. It is believed that Mr
Chambers' supporters account for another 4 per cent of EFG's stock.
Mr Joynes said the EGM motions cover the same ground as was considered at
the AGM.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Hawker wins significant work for new Boeing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAWKER SIDDELEY, the diversified engineering group, has become the second
British company to win a significant order to manufacture components for the
Boeing 777 wide bodied aircraft.
HS will today announce it has won an order worth about Pounds 90m to
manufacture flaps for the tail section for the 777, which is due to come
into service from 1995.
This follows the announcement last week that Smiths Industries, the
aerospace and medical equipment group, had won orders worth about Pounds
337m for computer systems to manage the plane's fuel and electrical power
systems.
The Boeing 777 is becoming an increasingly important project for aerospace
component makers, as they seek to respond to the decline in military
spending on aircraft.
The 777 is a twin engined, wide bodied plane, and is the only major new
civil aerospace project under development.
The Boeing order comes as HS is beset by rumours that it may become a
candidate for a take over bid from either BTR or Hanson, the industrial
conglomerates. HS last month reported a 30 per cent fall in pre-tax profits
after exceptional items.
The elevator flaps will be manufactured by HS's Australian aerospace
subsidiary, Hawker de Havilland, which is a long standing supplier of wing
flaps to Boeing.
It will be closely involved in the design and development of the flaps,
which will be made from advanced carbon fibre composite materials.
It is an indication of the size of the Boeing 777 that the 11 metre tail
flaps will be as large as flaps for the main wing sections of smaller Boeing
737.
The deal is an important boost for the HS aerospace division, which last
year increased profits by 20 per cent to Pounds 22m, on a 10 per cent
increase in turnover to Pounds 297m, about 14 per cent of the HS group
sales.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Pension fund surplus helps Rea Brothers to
Pounds 1.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REA BROTHERS, the small merchant banking group, reported pre-tax profits
almost unchanged at Pounds 1.6m for 1990, after realising a pension fund
surplus of Pounds 945,000.
The result (compared to Pounds 1.55m for 1989) was struck after a Pounds
480,000 provision for property-related bad loans.
Mr Roger Parsons, managing director, said the 1990 figures would be the last
to be affected by the reorganisation which had affected the group in the
past three years.
The pension fund surplus was realised after the group's final salary scheme
was wound up and replaced by individual money purchase schemes. The previous
scheme had become uneconomical to run following the substantial slimming of
staff, Mr Parsons said.
The private banking and trust business in Guernsey generated all of the
group's profits during the year, more than making up for a trading loss in
London.
Gross fee income, at Pounds 4m (Pounds 3.4m), again contributed some 40 per
cent of total income, with net interest income making up the balance.
Earnings per share came out at 3p (2.97p) and a recommended final dividend
of 0.25p makes an unchanged total for the year of 0.5p.
The group is still looking for a substantial increase in its funds under
management, which currently stand at something over Pounds 100m.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: The loneliness of the long-distance sponsor
 -How ADT could have to foot the Pounds 1.7m bill for a City school
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIFFICULTIES in finding other backers for a planned City Technology College
mean that ADT, the Bermuda-based car auctions and security group, may spend
up to Pounds 1.7m on the project.
ADT, which is being sued in the US by Laidlaw, a Canadian transport services
group that is its largest shareholder, is by far the largest corporate
sponsor of a City Technology College.
Mr Kenneth Baker, formerly education secretary, planned 20 of these
high-technology secondary schools for urban areas, to be 'mostly' financed
by private industry.
Few corporate donors have been found, however. Most lead sponsors of the 12
CTCs due to be operating by this September are wealthy individuals or
charitable organisations, rather than businesses.
ADT College, based in the London borough of Wandsworth, is the only one to
bear a corporate sponsor's name. Its pupils will wear uniforms with the ADT
logo.
The company provided the initial Pounds 1m contribution required of all lead
sponsors. It has also agreed to provide Pounds 150,000 of operating funds
each year for the life of the school, according to Mr Richard Painter, an
ADT official who is chief executive of the school.
Mr Painter said that, in addition, ADT has agreed to underwrite the
remaining Pounds 700,000 cash needed to bring private sponsorship up to the
Pounds 2.2m, or 20 per cent, of capital costs required by the Department of
Education and Science.
The department allows up to Pounds 500,000 of contributions in kind to be
counted towards the Pounds 2.2m figure. So far, donors have provided Pounds
250,000 in contributions of equipment.
If ADT cannot persuade other companies to make cash donations, it will end
up investing Pounds 1.7m in the project's start-up costs.
Mr Painter said education department officials warned ADT in January that
government funds to complete construction would not be forthcoming unless
the company guaranteed the remaining private-sector contributions.
Such guarantees have been required of all lead sponsors for the past year.
All except ADT, however, have been able to raise enough cash from other
sponsors to avoid the need to call on the guarantee.
By last week, ADT had been unable to raise any cash contributions from other
sponsors.
ADT College is based on a three-building site formerly occupied by a
comprehensive school. It will admit its first 300 pupils this autumn.
Enrolment will gradually rise to 1,200.
The school is to be furnished with the latest computer technology, and
language laboratories. Applications for the first year have outstripped
places by five to one.
Mr Painter says ADT is sponsoring the college because 'We think there is a
need to support education'. He says the company was approached by Sir Cyril
Taylor, chairman of the charitable CTC Trust and the government's chief
adviser on CTCs.
Mr Painter says that ADT College apart, the company's only educational
programme has been a Pounds 60,000 donation to the Grant Maintained Schools
Trust, a body that encourages schools to opt out of local authority control.
Mr Michael Ashcroft, ADT's chairman, is chairman of the trust which runs the
school. Mr Ashcroft lives in Florida.
Mr Painter said that when the school's board held one of its obligatory
meetings last December, the venue was somewhere in Europe.

<TEXT>
Cookson, the industrial materials group, has announced a co-ordinated series
of acquisitions and disposals affecting its business supplying the European
steel industry.
Net proceeds from the four deals will be Pounds 18m.
The announcement follows the group's successful Pounds 82.8m rights issue,
which it said on Friday was 96 per cent taken up by shareholders. The
combined effect of the rights and the recent deals will be to reduce
Cookson's net borrowings from Pounds 330m to Pounds 230m.
Gearing, which was above 100 per cent when the group suffered a crisis of
confidence last autumn, will fall to 35 per cent.
Most important of the deals is the Pounds 23.7m sale of Cookson Plibrico
International to ILVA, the Italian state-owned steel group. Plibrico makes
furnace linings for steelworks and made operating profits of Pounds 2.9m
last year.
The other deals, which are worth less than Pounds 5m each, include the
acquisition by Cookson of Metacon, a private Swiss company which designs
slide gates for steel casting, and two acquisitions by Vesuvius Italia, an
existing joint venture of ILVA and Cookson.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Ron Brierley in GPG restructuring package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR RON Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur, is to take over the running
of GPG, the British investment company, in a restructuring deal announced
yesterday.
Brierley Investments (BIL), which recently distanced itself from its
founder, intends to reduce its shareholding in GPG from 63 per cent to 40
per cent by selling 74m shares at 15p each to Australasian investors.
Sir Ron will buy 3 per cent of GPG from his former investment vehicle for
the same price.
He was founder president of BIL, the New Zealand-based international
investment concern that he created and chaired until last month.
All ordinary shareholders will be given 10p per share, and 86 per cent of
the par value of Pounds 726,000 of preference shares will be repaid plus the
accrued dividends of 6.3 per cent - the preference dividend has been passed
three times.
The shares of GPG, one wing of the former Guinness Peat Group, were
suspended in December at the time of its sale of Management Compensation
Group.
That left GPG as a shell company, the reason for its suspension, with about
Pounds 65m in cash and net-assets of 22p a share.
Three BIL investments which Sir Ron has been personally involved with are to
be sold to GPG for Pounds 6.8m. The major holdings are 29.86 per cent of
Stanley Gibbons Holdings, 14.99 per cent of Villa D'Este and 12.49 per cent
of Allgas Energy.
The restructuring package, which was negotiated by the GPG board with the
parent company, Industrial Equity (Pacific) and the holding company BIL,
will be put to shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting on May 13.
Sir Ron hopes the International Stock Exchange will restore GPG's listing
once it has secured its independence from BIL, widened its shareholder base
and reduced its cash.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Turriff plans reorganisation after fall to
loss of Pounds 933,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURRIFF CORPORATION, the troubled UK construction and plant hire group, is
to reorganise its business following a pre-tax loss of Pounds 933,000 in the
year to end-December.
The company's share price rose from 68p to 82p following the announcement.
The group, as it warned in February, is not paying a final dividend
(10.75p), leaving a total of 4.25p (15p) for the year. In 1989 Turriff made
a pre-tax profit of Pounds 5.82m.
Mr Astley Whittall, chairman, said that he would be disappointed if the
group did not pay at least a final dividend in the current year.
He said the group would be pulling out of housebuilding as part of the
reorganisation. Turriff has already withdrawn from its information and
marketing services business and has sold the Staffwise Employment Agency.
The sale of the agency, which had been bought only a year ago and had
contributed well since, had been essential to reduce the group's debt, Mr
Whittall maintained.
Following the reorganisation, the group would be left with two core
businesses - contracting and plant hire.
At the end of April Turriff's borrowings were Pounds 9.01m, compared with
shareholders' funds of just Pounds 8.84m.
In addition, the group was responsible for Pounds 4.26m of off-balance sheet
borrowings of joint-venture property companies.
Mr Whittall said that the group aimed to have reduced its balance sheet debt
from just over 100 per cent of shareholders' funds to about 50 per cent by
the end of this year.
He said that in the autumn Turriff expected to receive a refund of Pounds
2m, representing surplus on the group's pension fund.
This would be used to reduce borrowings.
The losses incurred in 1990 included provisions of Pounds 2.08m, of which
Pounds 1.65m was to cover possible losses against eight of the group's 15
joint-venture property developments.
A further Pounds 430,000 of provisions were made against the group's housing
operations to cover potential liabilities on equity-sharing deals.
Mr Whittall said that last year the group had sold 65 homes. This left only
53 more houses to sell before it closed the housebuilding operation.
Were it not for the provisions, the construction division would have broken
even.
However, reflecting problems in the construction market, plant hire profits
fell to Pounds 899,000 (Pounds 3.15m).
Losses per share worked through at 5.1p, compared with earnings of 53.6p.
COMMENT
Turriff's shares recovered 14p on the grounds that shareholders now know the
worst and that the company appears to have a strategy to reduce its high
gearing. However debt reduction is heavily dependent on a windfall pension
refund. Gearing will remain high if off-balance sheet loans and hire
purchase agreements are included as debt. The UK construction market is
likely to remain difficult for the rest of this year which will inhibit
contracting and plant hire profits. in the longer term, the prospects look
dull. Contracting and plant hire produce good cash flow, which the group
needs at present, but are low-margin businesses. The group has moved closer
to security and profits this year may recover to Pounds 1m-Pounds 1.5m, but
the shares are hardly a buy at this point.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Allied Leisure calling for further Pounds
16m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED LEISURE, the ten pin bowling and night club operator, yesterday
launched a Pounds 16.13m net rights issue, its second such call in less than
a year and one which will double the capital.
Its one-for-one issue of 17.5m shares is pitched at 97p, an 11 per cent
discount to yesterday's opening price. The shares slipped 5p to close at
104p after the announcement.
Mr Duncan Moss, finance director, said although the issue was following
quite swiftly on last year's Pounds 4m call, Allied would now be able to go
on expanding without recourse to shareholders for more cash.
The company is forecasting a final dividend of not less than 3.25p; that
would make 4.75p for the year ending July 16 1991, a 22 per cent increase
over the previous 3.9p. There is no profit estimate.
Yesterday, the company warned that 'trading and economic conditions caused
concern during January and February', but March had shown a significant
improvement. Results for the full year would be 'satisfactory' following the
advance of 73 per cent to Pounds 1.63m at halfway.
Allied also revealed it was applying to transfer from the USM to the
official list on May 9.
Mr Moss said it was intended to start three new developments in the next
financial year, which would cost in aggregate nearly Pounds 13m. These were
a MegaBowl ten pin bowling centre in Preston, a night club in Basingstoke
and a bowling, night club and theme bar development in Dundee.
During the current year Allied had spent about Pounds 15.4m on new leisure
developments. Sale of its 20 Wimpy restaurants in January last year helped
to fund that.
Following the rights issue net borrowings will fall to about Pounds 6.7m, or
22 per cent of shareholders' funds. Mr Moss said the policy was that that
gearing should not rise above 55 per cent from now on.
Directors, who currently speak for 30 per cent of the capital, will not be
taking up their rights.

FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Hunting declines 20% to Pounds 38.5m - Fall
of Pounds 5.4m in defence division damages group performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNTING, the defence, aviation and oil company, saw its pre-tax figure fall
by more than 20 per cent from Pounds 48.4m to Pounds 38.5m in the year to
December 31.
Turnover grew by 3 per cent to Pounds 771.3m, helped by increased sales of
crude oil in Canada.
The main reason for the profits fall was the defence division where
operating profits slid by Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 15.7m. Mr Ken Miller, chief
executive, said that this included rationalisation costs as 500 jobs were
cut and a plant closure provided for.
Small benefits had come from the Gulf crisis - for instance through orders
for bomb retarders. But the much publicised use of Hunting's JP233 airfield
attack weapons had been drawn from the forces' stocks, which were not
significantly depleted. As expected, the JP233's contribution would fall
back this year, Mr Miller said.
This would be partly offset by new contracts, such as managing the atomic
weapons establishment at Aldermaston, and international collaborations.
In the non-defence areas, oil and technology declined to Pounds 10.6m
(Pounds 12.7m), in spite of the increased turnover of Pounds 399m (Pounds
327m). Recession in the UK hit sales of specialised products, such as the
Hammerite range.
Aviation was the only one of the three core divisions to improve, making
Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 9.6m).
The disposal of non-core businesses depleted the profit from other
activities, which fell to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 5.2m). A couple of
subsidiaries and property valued at Pounds 20m remained to be sold. The
write-down in the value of assets for sale accounted for most of a Pounds
9.7m (Pounds 6.3m) extraordinary charge, said Mr Miller.
Also included were the trading results of sold or for sale businesses and
the related interest paid. This left Pounds 900,000 of interest received in
the ongoing businesses, notably from the defence division.
Fully diluted earnings per share were reduced to 23.5p (31.8p) and a
recommended final dividend of 6p makes a total of 10p (9p). The retained
profit dwindled to Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 13.4m).
COMMENT
It will be nice to get a set of results from Hunting which are easy to
compare with what has gone before. Last year's pre-tax profit, following the
merger of three family-controlled companies, showed a 42 per cent increase,
but on a pro forma basis. This time, figures that were above the line last
year - including some interest paid - have been put below because of the
disposal programme. The group's problem, however, remains the same: will
aviation and oil and technology make up for the decline in defence? If yes,
then when? The problem becomes more acute this year with the JP233 falling
away, disposals delayed and parts of the group hit by recession.
Compensating defence export orders remain a matter of optimism and a serious
step-up in the non-defence businesses may not come until 1993. With pre-tax
profit forecast to decline to Pounds 35m, a prospective p/e of 8,
yesterday's closing price of 177p is supported by a yield of 7.5 per cent.

FT  16 APR 91 / AT&amp;T ousts chairman and three directors of NCR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) has succeeded in ousting four
directors of NCR, the fifth-largest US computer manufacturer, including the
chairman, Mr Charles Exley.
NCR said that following certification of the results of a shareholders' vote
last month, it was expected that AT&amp;T's four nominees would replace Mr
Charles Exley Jr, chairman and chief executive; Mr Gilbert P. Williamson,
president; Cathleen Morawetz; and Mr William Bowen.
AT&amp;T had tried to win control of NCR's 12-member board of directors as part
of its hostile takeover bid.
NCR claimed victory in the proxy battle, however, because AT&amp;T failed to
remove all its directors. NCR has also said that it might expand the board
to reinstate any ousted directors.
AT&amp;T launched a Dollars 90-per-share bid to acquire NCR last December.
Subsequently, it raised the offer to Dollars 100 per share, or Dollars 6.8bn
(Pounds 3.8bn), if NCR would agree to a merger and remove its anti-takeover
defences, or if the entire board were replaced.
NCR's board has rejected the Dollars 90-per-share bid as 'grossly
inadequate' and Mr Exley has said that a price of Dollars 110 per share, or
about Dollars 7.5bn, is not open to negotiation.
At NCR's annual and special shareholders' meetings on March 28, AT&amp;T won
votes from 52.6 per cent of the computer group's shareholders at the special
meeting and 51.5 per cent at the AGM.
The votes give AT&amp;T the simple majority needed to replace four of NCR's
directors, but fall far short of the 80 per cent required to replace the
entire board.
Mr Exley said: 'We are especially pleased with AT&amp;T's low total vote in
light of AT&amp;T's pre-meeting predictions that they could achieve an 80 per
cent vote to remove our entire board.'
NCR also reported its first-quarter results yesterday. Earnings for the
quarter fell 12 per cent, partly due to the expenses involved in its
struggle against AT&amp;T.
First-quarter earnings were Dollars 46m, or 70 cents per share, down from
Dollars 52m, or 73 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
Revenue rose to Dollars 1.36bn from Dollars 1.27bn in the same period a year
ago.
NCR said earnings would have been 6 cents-per-share higher had it not been
for the special charges of Dollars 7m related to the AT&amp;T bid.

FT  16 APR 91 / Question mark over US insurers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST 500 US insurance companies have had a question mark placed against
their claims-paying ability in a new survey published yesterday by Standard
&amp; Poor's, the large US ratings agency.
Although many of the 489 companies - drawn from both the life and
property/casualty sectors - are small, they wrote an aggregate Dollars
18.3bn-worth (Pounds 10.3bn) of premiums in 1989.
The report comes close on the heels of last week's action against the main
operating unit of First Executive, the large Los Angeles-based insurer which
was taken over by the Californian state regulators.
The action by regulators was the largest-ever seizure of an insurance
company.
S&amp;P stressed that not all of the companies were necessarily in danger, but
suggested their financial condition was 'below average' and they 'deserve
close attention'.
The agency's findings come at a sensitive time for the US insurance
industry.
The issue of solvency regulation - and whether the state regulatory system
is adequate or whether a Federal agency should be set up - has been under
scrutiny for many months.

FT  16 APR 91 / Morgan Crucible issues Pounds 96m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN CRUCIBLE, the industrial materials manufacturer, yesterday announced
a Pounds 96.1m rights issue, before reporting a 10 per cent increase in 1990
pre-tax profits to Pounds 60m.
The rights issue, which Morgan said would allow it to take advantage of
international acquisition opportunities created by the recession, comes 10
months after its last cash call of Pounds 78m, which was priced at 248p per
share.
Morgan chief executive Dr Bruce Farmer said it was exploring at least five
acquisitions, including two in the US and one in Germany. The one-for-four
issue at 218p per new ordinary share will also finance two acquisitions
completed after the year-end, Dulmison in Australia and the Solder Removal
Company in California, which together cost Pounds 13m. Morgan's shares
closed 14p down at 256p after the news.
Dr Farmer said the company planned to consolidate in 1991. But with net debt
rising from Pounds 110m to Pounds 118m last year, a rights issue was the
'lesser evil' in raising finance for acquisitions.
The restructuring will focus Morgan on its traditional core areas in carbon
and ceramic products. Morgan plans to sell the car-care side of Holt Lloyd,
which it acquired in 1987, and dispose of its defence businesses which
account for much of the electronics business it has attempted to build up
over the last decade.
Dr Farmer said the case for the rights issue was borne out by the
performance of last year's acquisitions, which contributed Pounds 67.4m to
group turnover - which rose from Pounds 522m in 1989 to Pounds 580m  - and
Pounds 10.3m to operating profits, which increased from Pounds 66.3m to
Pounds 71.7m.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 60m against Pounds 54.5m last year were helped by
a one-off fall in net financing charges and currency hedging. Morgan had a
tough second half, with operating profits falling in three of its five
divisions compared with the first six months. Capital expenditure was cut by
about 40 per cent from Pounds 22m to Pounds 18.3m.
Earnings per share fell from 25.8p to 24.7p after fully diluting for last
year's rights issues. The directors are easing the way for the rights issue
by recommending a final divided of 6.75p, to bring the dividend for the year
to 12.4p, a 6 per cent rise.
The issue is being underwritten by Morgan Grenfell and the brokers to the
issue are Cazenove &amp; Co and County NatWest Wood Mackenzie &amp; Co.

FT  16 APR 91 / Threequarters of sunken oil tanker's cargo still on board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 700,000 barrels of oil are estimated to be still on board the
Haven, the Cypriot-registered supertanker which has sunk off Italy's
north-west coast, threatening an environmental disaster in some of the most
scenic parts of the Mediterranean.
Admiral Antonio Alati, the harbourmaster at Genoa, said yesterday that some
724,000 barrels of the original 1m barrels remained on board. The 232,163
deadweight tonnes tanker - a sister vessel of the Amoco Cadiz which caused a
pollution disaster off France in 1978 - sank on Sunday after exploding and
catching fire.
Italian pollution experts say removing the crude oil may prove more
difficult and costly than cleaning up the oil already spilled. If the
vessel's valves are intact, the crude oil could be pumped out through a
hose. Otherwise, it would be necessary to make a hole in the side of the
tanker and suck it out.
The whole operation could cost as much as Dollars 50m (Pounds 28m) if
recovering the oil takes as long as it did when a tanker, the Tanio, sank
off the coast of Brittany in 1980. Oil pollution experts say that estimates
are premature.
The Italian government will be able to draw on funds for the clean-up from
an international compensation fund set up by the International Maritime
Organisation.
A formula based on the size of the ship makes the tanker owner, which is
registered as Venha Maritime in Cyprus, liable for the first Dollars 18m of
the clean-up cost. After that, the international fund will provide
supplementary payment up to Dollars 81.5m.
Good weather yesterday helped efforts to deal with the existing six-mile oil
slick by surface skimming. Light winds were blowing the slick towards the
French coast, causing concern in Monaco and on the French riviera that the
oil might wash ashore. Oil has reached Italian beaches.
Off Livorno, attempts continued to put out fires on board the Agip Abruzzo,
the tanker which was rammed by the ferry Moby Prince on Wednesday night.
Local firefighters said the tanker could burn for days without igniting its
remaining cargo of crude, amid signs that the fire was diminishing.

FT  16 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Morgan Crucible
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
However it is presented, the Pounds 96m rights issue accompanying Morgan
Crucible's annual results is pretty cheeky. The ink has barely dried on last
summer's Pounds 79m acquisition-driven cash call, when new shares were
offered at 30p more than yesterday's issue. While there was a healthy Pounds
10.3m profits contribution from the businesses bought with the proceeds,
Morgan shares have underperformed the index by 11 per cent since last July
and by 24 per cent over five years.
Yesterday's call at a mere 218p was not helped by accounting of the sort
discouraged by the new Accounting Standards Board. A one-off Pounds 4.3m
currency gain was taken straight into operating profit, while Pounds 2.5m of
back-dated interest receivable was curiously booked to financing charges
when it should logically have been treated as either an extraordinary item
or an occasion to adjust previous years' figures.
This distorted the picture of what otherwise was a poor second half in which
underlying profits fell by more than 15 per cent from 1989 to Pounds 26.2m,
and margins slipped below 10 per cent. Put like that, the rights case looks
somewhat weaker. All the same, there are signs that Morgan has hit upon a
better strategic plan. Getting out of defence and car care marks the
expensive end of a failed 10-year experiment, but the core businesses should
be the stronger if some of the promised acquisitions can be completed at
bombed-out prices. Patient shareholders will probably find the 7.6 per cent
yield on the new shares irresistible. Morgan may be given the benefit of the
doubt this time, but it will need to mind its manners.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sight of sterling yesterday bumping up against the DM3.00 level had its
worrying aspects. However strong sterling may be, the UK money markets have
decided that further base rate cuts are ruled out for the time being by
domestic inflationary pressures. This makes for a combination of high
interest rates and strong currency which begins to look familiar. For the UK
corporate sector, it is just the regime designed under the ERM to squeeze
inflation out of the system the hard way.
What makes this situation perverse is the route by which it has been arrived
at. Sterling's strength is merely an illusion caused by D-Mark weakness.
Since the turn of the year, the D-Mark has fallen by over 10 per cent
against both the dollar and the yen. Against sterling, it has fallen only 4
per cent. As Mr Tietmeyer of the Bundesbank remarked yesterday, German
domestic conditions make a strong D-Mark and high German interest rates
independently desirable. However much further the D-Mark has to fall in the
short run, that logic will doubtless prevail eventually. What price the UK
corporate sector then?
There is a counter-argument which points to the unusually high level of
capital investment by UK companies in the late 1980s and the scope this
might give for productivity improvement in the early 1990s. UK business
investment as a proportion of GDP peaked at 17 per cent in 1989, compared
with only 12 per cent in 1985. Conceivably, this might allow UK productivity
to improve just as German productivity is weakening under the strain of
unification. If so, nominal wage settlements in the UK might be able to
continue at a relatively high level without leading to overvaluation of
sterling. The snag is that this suggests UK industry managing its affairs
better than its German rivals for the first time in living memory. With the
UK equity market poised just below its all-time high, it might be unwise to
take that on trust.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The best bit of the Coats/Tootal battle is possibly yet to come. Once the
bidder improves its offer and adds a little paper, the gloves are likely to
be well and truly off. Attacking Coats's own rather dismal acquisition
record is really Tootal's best hope. Certainly, its claim to continued
independence as set out in yesterday's second defence document still looks
quite thin. Granted, the management axe is finally being wielded; and
indeed, there is a danger that customers like Marks and Spencer will look
for alternative suppliers to reduce their dependence on the combined group.
On the other hand, action to reduce costs should have been taken earlier;
inconvenient as it may be for Tootal, its gushing enthusiasm for the idea of
the merger is set out in black and white in the Office of Fair Trading
report of 18 months ago. The game is still Coats's if it wants it.

FT  16 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Stick to the devil you know
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,542.8 (+16.7)
General Accident's ignominious exit from NZI Bank is perhaps an appropriate
finale to the financial swashbuckling of the late 1980s. No wonder the
market is littered with corpses when a prudent Scottish financial
institution like General Accident - which in the two previous less eventful
decades barely strayed further from its native Perth than the dales of
Yorkshire - suddenly throws caution to the winds and buys into an unfamiliar
business at the far end of the world.
The cost of General Accident's escapade is unclear: anything between 10 per
cent and 20 per cent of shareholders' funds, depending on how generous a
valuation is put on the remaining insurance assets. Whereas the Prudential
and Guardian Royal Exchange can be fairly certain that the book is closed on
their estate agency and Italian non-life blunders respectively, GA
shareholders may not necessarily have heard the last of this one. Winding
down a bank which nobody else wants to buy - notwithstanding the company's
assurance that the loan portfolio is clean - generally proves an expensive
and time-consuming business.
The market has become numbed by bad news from the composites. Yesterday's 7p
fall in the shares to 555p reflected merely the disappointment of earlier
hopes of finding a buyer for NZI. Meanwhile, it is back to basics for GA in
the sober knowledge that net assets were actually lower last year than at
the end of 1983 - a period in which dividends and premium income have almost
trebled. At least there is the comfort that the stock market is still
prepared to buy the shares at a 12 per cent premium to estimated net assets.

FT  16 APR 91 / Letter: Poll tax should not be included in the RPI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DOMINIC HOBSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Esmond Lindop defends the inclusion of the poll tax in the retail price
index on the grounds that it was decided not by statisticians but by the RPl
Advisory Committee after 'many hours of discussion' between the various
interests represented on it (Letters, March 28). This is an exceptionally
silly contribution to the debate over how we measure retail price inflation
in Britain.
It is precisely because the RPI Advisory Committee is composed not of
statisticians and economists but of trade union representatives and low pay
and social security lobbyists like Mr Lindop that it reaches such bizarre
conclusions.
'Many hours of discussion' in a body composed largely of groups with a
vested interest in bumping up the RPI are much more likely to be
characterised by special pleading than intellectual rigour.
Rates were included in the RPl as part of the cost of housing. This was
probably defensible but, as rigorous intellects recognised long ago, the
community charge is not part of the cost of anything.
It is a tax. A tax is not a price and therefore has no place in a retail
price index. I do not think any disinterested statistician or economist
would dispute this observation.

FT  16 APR 91 / Letter: Bush decision over interference in Iraq courageous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr ROBERT MCGEEHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Of course there is vexation as the world watches the desperate attempts
of the Iraqi rebels to topple the regime of Saddam Hussein ('Anguish of
victory', March 30), but the US refusal to become directly involved should
not be equated with policy confusion.
It is all too easy to accuse the American president of failing to take
advantage of the military success of Desert Storm as the Kurdish and Shia
insurgents are brutally repressed.
George Bush's decision to keep out of the internal politics of Iraq is no
less courageous than his determination to lead the allied coalition to
victory in strict conformity with UN Security Council resolutions.
Could this great achievement in upholding international law really be
well-served by subsequent unauthorised intrusion into the domestic affairs
of even so guilty a leader as the Iraqi dictator?

FT  16 APR 91 / Letter: No evidence to suggest that credit crunch is greater
outside the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEREMY HALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Anthony Harris misrepresents the case I made for remaining sanguine
about the credit crunch issue ('Avoiding the crunch questions about credit',
April 2).
It is not just that bank lending in four major economies - the US, the UK,
Japan and Germany - is growing no more slowly than during the last two
substantial world economic recessions. Survey data indicate that the decline
in the growth rate of US bank lending is still closely related to weaker
corporate demand for credit, leaving little room for supply restrictions to
explain the slowdown.
Federal Reserve data show that the importance of banks as purveyors of
credit to the economy has been on a declining trend for 20 years, with other
sources such as the commercial paper markets becoming increasingly
important.
According to the Securities Data Corporation, stock and bond issuance in US
markets in the first quarter of this year was at a record high and 30.6 per
cent up on a year ago. Elsewhere the evidence is more sketchy, but does not
support the view that the crunch is greater outside the US.
In any country, there may now be greater-than-normal distress lending by the
banks. I do not deny that the corporate sector is facing a severe squeeze,
at least in the UK and the US.
What would be dangerous now would be for the authorities again to
over-compensate for what will turn out to be a temporary period of economic
weakness. History is replete with examples of overly expansionary monetary
policies, which stoke inflation and do nothing to improve growth over the
medium term. This often occurs just when the justification for easy money
appears 'special'. Remember the 1987 equity market crash and the need to
ease policy aggressively to avoid a global depression in 1988?
To argue that the dollar's recent recovery is the result of the Federal
Reserve's easy money policies is ridiculous. Since early 1989, US short
rates have fallen from 10 per cent to just below 6.5 per cent and the dollar
has depreciated by about 15 per cent against the D-Mark, even including a
recent rally. It has been the belief that US rates are near a trough that
has helped the dollar, not the market's confidence in the policies of Mr
Greenspan. The latter will leave the US with the highest inflation rate in
the Group of Five industrialised countries by the end of this year.
While I cannot speak for all City economists, my employers do not pay me to
think like the Bank of England.

FT  16 APR 91 / Letter: Don't encourage Third World defaults
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From LORD BAUER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr James Skinner (Letters, April 11) charges me with misuse of
statistics and understanding the debt burden of poor countries. He cites
Africa to support his contention.
The statistics I used refer to Latin America, the principal thrust of the
argument of the Bishop of Oxford, which focused largely on Brazil. The bulk
of African debt is owed to official lenders under various aid agreements.
The debts represent loans with a substantial grant element.
The limiting case is the international development association loans,
50-year loans, unindexed for inflation, at zero interest. The debts of
African countries have often been cancelled or rescheduled, frequently
several times for the same country. To treat debt as necessarily burdensome
also ignores the initial transfer of resources.
This is like saying that banks, building societies, and governments issuing
saving certificates are burdened when they pay interest. If the funds are
used productively, debt service is not a burden in the critical sense that
the debtors would be better off if they had not borrowed.
I do not know what Mr Skinner has in mind in referring to institutions
serving only western interests, and by clear implication inflict suffering
on the poor. What I do know is that throughout Asia, Africa and Latin
America the level of material achievement declines as we move away from the
effect of western commerce.
To harp on alleged external causes of Third World poverty diverts attention
from the real factors behind this poverty which are domestic, and thereby
from the possibilities of addressing these. These factors include, among
others, government policies and extensive, often enforced, dependence on
precarious subsistence production.
It is pertinent also that the poorest are low among the priorities of the
local rulers. State help for the poorest, especially the rural poor,
conflicts with the political and personal interests of the rulers, and may
not accord with local mores. Such considerations are reinforced by
ubiquitous civil conflict. An Arab-dominated Sudanese government will not
help the poorest blacks hundreds of miles away with whom it is in armed
conflict; the Sinhalese government will not help the Tamil poor, nor will
the government of Ethiopia the poor of Tigre.
As I said in my letter, harping on alleged western causes of Third World
poverty reflects and reinforces feelings of guilt, which is a self-centred
sentiment. Encouraging Third World countries to default inhibits the inflow
of productive commercial capital, which, together with the skills that went
with it, over the last 150 years transformed life in many poor countries,
notably in south-east Asia, west Africa and Latin America.

FT  16 APR 91 / Time to sort out who owns what: Eastern Europe's emerging
democracies must define property rights if they are to attract western
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday in London, leaders from 30 countries launched an initiative which
they hope will help bind the political and economic systems of eastern
Europe closer to the west. With the inauguration of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, the nations of eastern Europe have found a
vehicle to mobilise western support in reviving their shattered economies.
But there is a growing consensus among western governments that the new
rulers of eastern Europe will themselves have to do more to assist in this
reconstruction. While these governments are looking to the west, and the
EBRD, for aid to curb unemployment, maintain stability and get their
economies back on their feet, it is only through a large inflow of foreign
investment that the basis can be created for sustained economic growth. And
in attracting investment, a large part of the problem resides in the east
Europeans' own backyards.
The twin issues of property rights and ownership are crucial to the economic
success of the emerging democracies. But as yet, legislation to define the
two has not been enacted in most of these countries. Without putting in
place these central planks of the market economy system, eastern Europe is
likely to be seeking hand-outs from western donors for a long time.
This is not to underestimate what has already been achieved. Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania have all moved, or are
beginning to move, rapidly towards allowing market forces a much greater
role in their economies. All of them have introduced price reforms and
scrapped subsidies on food, consumer goods, clothes, cars, housing, and
energy - in all cases, at the cost of rising unemployment.
They have also made considerable strides towards setting up a legal
framework for privatising the large swathes of their economies hitherto
owned by the state. As the accompanying table shows, all five governments
are now committed - with varying degrees of openness - to privatisation and
to attracting foreign investment. Poland is furthest down this road,
followed by Hungary and Czechoslovakia. But even Bulgaria and Romania, after
a shaky start, are now pressing ahead.
Yet so far, all the activity has yielded little investment. Over the past
year Poland has attracted a total of Dollars 350m (Pounds 197.7m) in foreign
investment, mainly in joint ventures; Hungary about Dollars 1bn. There have
been individual rich pickings, such as the Skoda car works in Czechoslovakia
(a 70 per cent share in which was bought by Volkswagen of Germany last
year), the Tungsram electric bulb group in Hungary (bought by General
Electric of the US a year ago), and Zamech, the Polish turbine manufacturer
bought by ABB of Switzerland. But overall the flow of investment has been a
disappointment.
It should not, however, really be surprising after 40 years of communist
misrule. The policies of rapid industrialisation pursued by the post-war
regimes of the region may have initially helped pull eastern Europe out of
its agricultural past, but in the end the lack of competition and investment
led to industrial obsolescence: witness the sorry state of the region's
physical infrastructure.
Since the communists fell, privatisation has come to be identified as the
best way of stopping the rot. Western governments and financial
institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,
encouraged east European governments to move quickly to sell off state
assets as a means of attracting western investment, building the market
economy, and breaking the stranglehold of the state bureaucracy.
For their part, the governments viewed privatisation as a way of dismantling
the economic and political power base of the communists. This was the theme
of the election campaigns which swept across eastern Europe last year. The
electorate did not vote for radical economic policies as such; it voted
against the communist system. Economic policy-making and
institution-building would follow.
This is part of the problem. Privatisation is being introduced back to front
 -without an infrastructure to support it. None of these countries yet has a
western-style accounting, banking or capital markets system. Nor does any of
them have much of an indigenous property-owning class.
Eastern Europe's largely Jewish middle classes were almost completely
destroyed by Hitler between 1938 and 1945. The survivors either emigrated or
had their property confiscated by the communists.
In Poland, Stalin destroyed at Katyn, the cream of the professional class.
In Czechoslovakia, the middle classes had all their property confiscated
after 1948. Despite the extermination of Hungary's 600,000 Jewish community,
the backbone of the country's industrial and cultural class, it probably
still has the largest middle class/intellectual elite which can facilitate
the transformation. An entrepreneurial class was partially encouraged by Mr
Janos Kadar, the former communist party leader, who allowed the expansion of
the second economy and small private shops.
In Bulgaria, Mr Todor Zhivkov, the former party leader, promoted the rural
classes at the expense of the middle classes. In Romania, the 700,000-strong
ethnic German community, which formed the backbone of the middle classes
after the Second World War, has dwindled to less than 170,000 due to
emigration.
As a result, eastern Europe is having to create a property-owning class  -
in conjunction with foreign investors. But here the new governments of the
region are bumping up against another central problem: the near-total
confusion about who owns what.
Unless they define property and ownership rights, the governments of eastern
Europe are likely to put off foreign investors. Investors need to know
whether they can buy and sell land - whether for private use, or for the
expansion of their business.
It is not that there is a shortage of investment opportunities. Among the
potentially lucrative enterprises waiting to be tapped are:
In Bulgaria, the government is contemplating the break-up of the state
tobacco monopoly;
In Romania, US, Italian and British companies are seeking advice on how to
buy into the country's internationally competitive textile, leather and shoe
industries;
In Czechoslovakia, NM Rothschild, the UK merchant bank, is advising the
government on how to privatise the Transgas pipeline, which carries energy
from the Soviet Union to western Europe;
In Hungary, Schroder Wagg, another British merchant bank, is advising the
Hungarian State Property Agency on the privatisation of Interglob, a
transportation and distribution business.
In Poland, the consulting firm AT Kearney is preparing the copper mining
conglomerate KGHM for privatisation and possible purchase by foreign
investors.
But in all these cases, buyers will remain hesitant until ownership rights
are defined. The problem is another legacy of the communist era. In most
east European countries, land, shops, factories, restaurants and hotels were
nationalised after the communists seized power in 1948. In others, the prime
example being Bulgaria, land remained the property of agricultural
co-operatives, which were amalgamated in the 1970s with the giant
agro-industrial complexes, or state-run collective farms.
Privatisation depends crucially on sorting out the mess. This means
addressing many questions: should owners of land and property confiscated by
the communists be compensated in kind; should all, or indeed any,
confiscated land be returned to their original owners, their descendants, or
those who emigrated; how much will the compensation cost?
There is no ready-made formula for dealing with these questions. But apart
from Romania and Albania, which have yet to define property rights, all east
European countries are grappling with the issue:
In Poland, the government earlier this month decided not to return to its
original owners all property which was nationalised after 1945 because it
would be too expensive. Instead, Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the minister for
privatisation, said former owners would receive bonds entitling them to buy
shares in any newly-privatised companies in compensation for the loss of
their property.
'You cannot turn history back. You must take into account the time factor,
the budget factor, the need to stimulate foreign investment,' he said.
Poland wants to avoid the problems being encountered in east Germany. There
former property owners were given the right to reclaim their land, a blanket
commitment that has caused legal confusion and slowed the privatisation
process. 'If we question the communist acts of nationalisation and land
reform, we will question the whole post-war legal structure in Poland,'
argued Mr Lewandowski. But his proposals have been criticised by the
Association of Real Estate owners, a group of former property-owners, who
are demanding the return of full ownership rights to those whose properties
were confiscated or nationalised by the communists. In Warsaw alone, 18,000
properties were confiscated in 1945.
The government of Czechoslovakia has adopted a different approach. A law
passed in February will allow the return of property confiscated between
February 25, 1948 (the date of the communist coup) and January 1, 1990. It
will apply only to individuals, and will exclude emigres who did not return
to Czechoslovakia before that date. The federal government reckons that
about 10 per cent of all state-owned property, worth Dollars 10.7bn, will be
returned to former owners. But it has not indicated how the restitution of
property will be financed.
In Hungary, the conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum, the main party in
the ruling coalition, is proposing to give expropriated owners first option
to regain their old nationalised property if they can provide evidence of
title. This could entail legal searches before state property can be sold -
a process likely to be complicated by the fact that a third of all
Hungarians live abroad.
Mr Lajos Csepi, managing director of the State Property Agency (SPA), said
last week that the government's plan 'will obviously slow down
privatisation. It would be disastrous. Foreign investors do not come because
they do not know what is going to happen.'
What is more, the process is likely to be very costly. The government has
already admitted that returning property and issuing compensation bonds will
cost more than the Dollars 940m already already earmarked by the finance
ministry.
Even so, the proposed law is under attack for not going far enough. The
government is under pressure on the issue from the Smallholders party, a
junior coalition partner which favours the return of all property seized by
the communists after 1945. The bill goes before the constitutional court
later this month.
In Bulgaria, the communists did not nationalise the agricultural
co-operatives which had become a feature of the country's economy before the
war. But the government remains reluctant to allow full private property
rights for land. It believes this would lead to the break-up of the
co-operatives and destroy the economy's agricultural base. Bulgarian
nationalists are also concerned that if property rights were freed, the
Turkish minority would buy large tracts of land, exacerbating ethnic
tensions.
All this amounts to another hefty political and legislative agenda for the
new governments of eastern Europe. But until they resolve the issues of
property and ownership, foreign investors will continue to hang back.

FT  16 APR 91 / Leading Article: Housing and inflation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSING has long been a conversation piece for the British people;
understandably so, since 40 per cent of personal wealth is held in the
Englishman's castle. As is noted in a new study of quality and choice in
housing from the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research, the
finance of housing is also a mess. But the focus of recent attention has
been narrower, on the links between housing and inflation.
In his Budget speech, for example, Mr Norman Lamont remarked that home
ownership 'remains a key objective of policy for this government. A less
desirable development, however, was the dramatic boom in house prices during
the late 1980s, which fuelled borrowing and helped boost inflation'.
Subsequently, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton told the House of Commons Treasury
and Civil Service committee that he was attracted by the idea of some
restriction on levels of lending for individual mortgages.
Tackling the alleged inflationary consequences of the British housing market
is more complex than generally supposed. But to the extent that the problem
is excessive growth of credit, which it is not at the moment, the best
instrument remains the interest rate. It must be used so long as the ERM
permits.
Price spiral
Fortunately, a house price spiral like that of 1987-88 remains unlikely in
the near future, even though wage inflation and house price deflation are
returning the ratio of house prices to average earnings towards the levels
of the mid-1980s. At the end of 1989, however, personal net worth in housing
was more than Pounds 800bn. Though smaller by now, it must still be very
large. The immediate risk, therefore, is that lower interest rates would
lead to an economically destabilising increase in equity withdrawal from
housing.
One reason for wondering whether this is such a risk is that the ratio of
personal debt to personal disposable income doubled in the 1980s. It is
unlikely to increase at a comparable rate in the 1990s. Yet the governor of
the Bank of England was concerned about precisely this danger when he
remarked that 'those who already have large houses might well be restricted
in the amount they can borrow when they change houses'.
Given the size of the available equity cushion, restrictions on equity
withdrawal would have to be justified not on prudential grounds, but as a
selective form of monetary control. Such a measure would run into an obvious
objection: why should people not be able to make use of the wealth locked up
in their houses?
Interest relief
An alternative to controls on equity withdrawal would be to lower the value
of housing. The withdrawal of mortgage interest relief is often recommended
for this, but its importance is exaggerated. This subsidy is now effectively
cash-limited. The capital value of a cash-limited subsidy worth Pounds 7.8bn
a year at current long-term nominal interest rates is about Pounds 80bn.
Withdrawal of the entire relief would, therefore, lower net worth in the
housing stock by little more than 10 per cent. The planned re-introduction
of property taxes would do at least as much. The relevance of withdrawing
mortgage interest relief and re-introducing property taxes is not that they
would prevent equity withdrawal, but that they should postpone the next
price spiral.
To the extent that equity withdrawal itself is the target, the appropriate
fiscal measure would be imposition of capital gains tax on the part of
equity withdrawal that corresponds to the real gains. Introduction of
capital gains tax into owner-occupied housing would, however, need to be
combined with roll-over relief.
Inevitably distorting controls on borrowing, other than purely prudential
ones, must be deemed a very last resort. Withdrawing mortgage interest
relief is justified, as is the re-introduction of taxation on property, but
neither is relevant to equity withdrawal. If something is to be done about
that danger, a modified capital gains tax should be applied to
owner-occupied housing. The chancellor has been prepared to slaughter Mrs
Thatcher's sacred cows. Can he possibly be prepared to go that far?

FT  16 APR 91 / Leading Article: The trouble with insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR UK clearing bankers who are now paying heavily for the ill-judged loans
and acquisitions they made in the 1980s, there is at least one consolation.
Their opposite numbers in the insurance business appear to have been quite
as successful at finding novel ways of losing their shareholders' and
policyholders' money.
The news that General Accident is to wind down the banking interests of its
NZI Corporation subsidiary in New Zealand, having failed to find a buyer, is
just one of several unhappy legacies from diversification moves that
continue to haunt British insurers. Others include the loss-making
incursions by Prudential and others into estate agency, Guardian Royal
Exchange's unhappy joint venture into the Italian insurance market and Eagle
Star's adventures in property loan insurance. Why, it might be asked, do
these mistakes seem to come in neatly ordered batches?
Clearly the insurance company losses are not on the same scale as those
incurred by the banks in the Third World or in property. But nor is it
coincidence that banks and insurers found themselves taking unusual risks at
much the same time.
The problems of the banks could be rationalised by pointing to the impact of
excess monetary expansion on a sector whose core business was being eroded
by excessive competition. Underlying profitability was inadequate, yet the
obvious solutions - hostile takeovers and corporate bankruptcies - were not
permitted to whittle down sufficiently the number of banks chasing
unprofitable business.
Overcapitalised
Insurance, too, is a mature industry. And while monetary policy does not
have such a direct impact, it does have an influence through asset prices
and the broader pattern of the economic cycle. In the mid-1980s stock
markets were riding high at a time of increasing underwriting profitability,
causing solvency margins to soar way above the legally required levels.
Insurance companies were thus overcapitalised; and since this is an industry
in which there is no equivalent of the industrialist's fixed or working
capital requirement, cash flow tended to burn a hole in insurance companies'
pockets.
The process then accelerated further, as 1992 fever gripped Europe. British
insurers started to worry that their open capital markets would make them
vulnerable to foreign takeovers. Against that background the acquisition of
estate agents looked an attractive way of obtaining access to customers in a
more competitive market. At the same time growth by acquisition looked a
tempting substitute for a genuine strategy for selling insurance products in
the single market. In practice ownership strategies were heavily influenced
by availability of listed companies. Continental European insurers plunged
into the mature US market because there were companies there to buy. New
Zealand gave British insurers an entree to otherwise inaccessible countries
in South East Asia.
Perverse result
Overcapitalisation naturally provided a temptation to overpay. And the
result has been strikingly perverse. General Accident's acquisition of a New
Zealand insurance and banking conglomerate has resulted in Britain importing
New Zealand's banking bad debts. The Italians have recycled the skeletons in
their domestic motor insurance industry's cupboard to a British company that
was chiefly interested in the Italian life market. An army of British estate
agents has been absurdly enriched. The consumer of insurance services,
meantime, has yet to see much benefit.
When an industry moves from cartelisation to liberalisation it is
inevitable, whether in insurance or banking, that management aspiration will
outstrip capability. That problem is magnified by the huge challenge
inherent in conglomerate or cross-border acquisitions where managers abandon
familiar territory for the great unknown. Yet some boards of directors have
exercised a more judicious restraining influence than others. Too many
non-executive directors have failed to pull their weight.

FT  16 APR 91 / Arts: Herodiade - Queen Elizabeth Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chelsea Opera Group gave on Sunday a concert performance of Massenet's
Herodiade that was nearly as successful as their Thais a few years ago. The
achievement was only a lesser one in the way the work itself is: whereas
Thais, a chamber drama for all its touches of exotic spectacle, contains its
Grand Opera gestures within a beautifully economic account of human
sexuality and human frailty, the earlier opera gives rather too often the
impression of attempting to 'do an Aida' - to the detriment of Massenet's
most valuable gifts.
These included - as the best parts of Sunday's concert proved beyond
argument - the ability to make sensuously curling melody and the intimate
portrayal of characters in a state of weakness part of the same dramatic
impulse. The principals of Herodiade, an opera some way 'after Flaubert' and
before Wilde and Strauss, are a candidly innocent Salome (soprano), whose
mother abandoned her in childhood, a Baptist (tenor) not unaffected by her
charms (it is not she who clamours for his head), a clamorous, doubt-torn
Herodias (mezzo) who discloses her relationship to her supposedly long-lost
daughter in the opera's closing bars), and a Herod (baritone) openly in
pursuit of the young girl. Whenever the four and their linked affections are
dramatised in close-up, all four-square brassiness disappears.
In such passages, the potency of Massenet's feeling for music-drama is not
in question. Certainly, the strengths of Sunday's reading were connected
with the quartet of leading characters. The casting was imaginative: young
British or British-based singers, all able to deliver reasonable-sounding
French - in the case of Brian Bannatyne-Scott's Phanuel and Rosa Mannion's
Salome, better than that - and all able to temper large phrases with
delicacy and shapeliness. By contrast, while the COG chorus and orchestra
mustered their energies impressively under Michael Lloyd's vigilant baton,
the Grand Opera outward trappings seemed dated and secondhand.
The most complete Massenites of the evening were Anne-Marie Owens
(Herodias), whose wide-ranging, lustrous mezzo is now well fitted for a
whole host of big 19th-century roles, and Mr Bannatyne-Scott, whose velvety
tones are filling out without forcing, and whose sense of style is
impeccable. Forcing at the top was the single flaw of Miss Mannion's
charming, notably musical Salome; to Massenet's dramatic-tenor Baptist,
Graeme Matheson-Bruce brought dignity and power at climaxes, if not much
cantabile grace.
Peter Sidhom, suffering a throat infection, was nevertheless a strong,
firm-toned Herod. The smaller parts were well taken by (among others)
Glenville Hargreaves and Katrina Makepeace-Lott. On such an evening as this
Chelsea Opera Group seem as necessary to London musical life as ever.

BBC1's drama series about a lawyer whose partner has absconded with the
firm's cash, Kinsey, is proving quite a superior bit of entertainment.
Kinsey's smirking competitor, who was appointed as minder by the Law
Society, has been replaced by pretty Miss Mabbott. Kinsey was awfully shirty
with her last week so he must be about to fall for her (9.30).
The word 'investigative' is used loosely to describe too many sorts of
journalism, including the kind practised in Taking Liberties (9.50 BBC2).
Exculpatory journalism might be a better description: the championing of
people who have fallen foul of the law or been wrongly judged guilty.
Today's episode considers difficulties in suing for medical damages.
Channel 4's 'Banned' season includes a look at current Soviet comedy in From
Russia With Laughter (10.00) and then Monty Python's Life of Brian, a film
which should not be watched by Christians whose faith is so weak that they
cannot bear jokes about their religion.

FT  16 APR 91 / Arts: String quartets - Goldsmiths' Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The contest that since 1979 has been held at three-year intervals in
Portsmouth has now shifted northeast, to become the London International
String Quartet Competition. The final round took place on Sunday, when five
competing young quartets remained. Since Beethoven was prescribed for this
round, and each team had had to declare a choice long before, we heard opus
95 and the First 'Rasumovsky' twice each.
In the event, the order in which the teams appeared was an uncanny match for
what proved to be the winning order in reverse, almost as if someone had
pre-guessed the result. (The sole discrepancy lay in programming the second
and third prizewinners the wrong way round). This year none of the British
or German ensembles had reached the finals, nor the Italian one nor the
French. Of several USSR teams only the Moscow-based Russo Quartet came
through, but the notably large American contingent supplied three
challengers.
Like the Russian quartet (and the Werethina Quartet from Germany, whom we
didn't hear but who won the Artistic Director Yehudi Menuhin's special prize
for promise) the Americans are all led by women - and every member of the
Lark Quartet from LA is female. It was the Czech all-male Wihan Quartet,
however, who won, playing the second First 'Rasumovsky'. On the strength of
what we heard they seemed a fair enough choice, though it was faintly
surprising to hear it reported as 'unanimous' among the 11 judges: evidently
this year has enjoyed a strong field, and all the quartet-finalists merited
keen attention. No doubt the earlier rounds made the difference.
The Lark Quartet took second prize, but performed like the other American
teams before the interval. After it we heard the Russians (third prize) and
the Czechs, which threw an intriguing point into sharp relief. Every
American quartet shared a collective rhythmic impulse, strongly theatrical,
which neither of the Eastern ensembles sustained: in both their performances
there were momentary disorders that betrayed failures to listen to each
other. What distinguished the Wihan players was their cultured address,
judiciously weighted note-by-note and productive of beautiful effects in
their 'Rasumovsky' middle-movements; beautifully taught, certainly. Yet
their opening Allegro was staid, and Beethoven's teasing string of
mock-closes in the Finale po-faced and tedious.
On the other hand, in that same op. 59 no. 1 the Lark players had been so
light and speedy, with plenty of bright ideas and some fetchingly lyrical
playing, as to jettison some of the robust gravity of the work. In
Beethoven's F minor quartet op. 95 - the other direct comparison here - the
hell-for-leather intensity of the Miami Quartet (fourth prize) rode
roughshod over some details, but it was more faithful to the drama of the
work than the earnest Russo Quartet ever were, despite their big, satisfying
sound and well-honed rhetoric. In the Scherzo their dotted-note rhythms were
slack and casual, a fault one doesn't expect from the Russian school.
The odd Beethoven out was the Third 'Rasumovsky' in C, with which the
Fidelio Quartet (Florida and California: fifth prize) began this final
contest. Many lively, fluent ideas, but no firm grasp of the larger
structure, opaque and knotty as it is - until their brilliantly risky,
all-in-one-breath Finale. It would be comforting to believe that the
well-taught Wihan and Russo Quartets may one day try on risks like that.

FT  16 APR 91 / Arts: Antony and Cleopatra - Birmingham Rep/Shaw Theatre,
NW1
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra know their place in history. Like
Virgil's earlier Dido and Aeneas and Racine's later Titus and Berenice, they
know their deeds tip whole realms. That sense of consequence and scale is
what I miss in these dissimilar stagings of this intoxicating play.
The greatest flaw in the Birmingham Rep Antony is its most famous asset  -
Sylvia Syms's Cleopatra. She brings to the great role a bourgeois
self-importance, some four or five different moods, a transparently
practised species of charm, a grande dame flamboyance, a heavy humour and
some blurry consonants. Little chemistry between her and Malcolm Tierney is
evident. Only when this Antony is dead and gone, in 'I dreamt there was an
Emperor Antony,' does she at last - though, alas, not lastingly - discover
stillness, lyricism and majesty.
Tierney never lacks stillness; and his voice is impressively experienced and
varied. He builds, from too understated a beginning, to a powerful and
humane account of Antony's fluctuations. Like Syms, however, he does not
always project fully into the Rep (so acoustically tricky). And his eyes -
unlike his eyebrows - make almost no effect.
John Adams has updated his Birmingham production to Napoleonic times. Roman
classicism is replaced by French neoclassicism. By contrast, Egypt is more
natural and timeless. Though this works better than a clever-clever
programme essay led me to expect, it inevitably diminishes the play's
resonance in our imagination and clutters our heads with superfluous ideas.
In that respect, Roger Butlin's elegant Birmingham designs are no more
effective than the tatty, minimal designs for Tim Hegarty's Commonweal
production, at the Shaw.
Cleopatra is where Commonweal is strongest. Granted, Susan Curnow does not
have infinite variety; she lacks 'a tawny front'; I cannot imagine her
hopping 'forty paces through the public street.' But, from her first
appearance, it is plain that this Cleopatra is an Egyptian queen, that she
and Antony are physically intimate, and that she knows she controls lives. I
was fascinated by how she uses her supple neck and waist to hint
occasionally at the flattened 2-D profiled positions of Egyptian
bas-reliefs. She has clarity, spontaneity, bite and wit.
Though the production is visually too shabby and could be more imaginative
in its use of its few simple props, it keeps up a constant contrast between
Rome and Egypt and builds up to a properly transcendent Liebestod glow. Not
much else is memorable. Andrew McDonald is a tough, intelligent but unheroic
Antony. Max Haffler's Enobarbus is an ordinary Northerner who recognises the
wonder of the great people with whom he deals - more 'right' but also more
dull than the harsh, bitter account at Birmingham by Eric Richard.
Only one actor in either version has the complete measure of his role and
Shakespeare's verse. This is, at Birmingham, Simon Dormandy as Caesar. He is
by turns cold, compassionate, cerebral, self-righteous, forceful,
appreciative, grand. Ambition gleams in his eye and voice. Destiny, too.

FT  16 APR 91 / Arts: Mitridate, re di Ponto - Monte Carlo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Mozart opera of the 1991 'Printemps des arts de Monte Carlo' -
obviously, in this year of the Mozart bicentenary, there had to be one - was
Mitridate, re di Ponto. This opera seria is the success story among the
early-Mozart-opera rediscoveries: productions have been cropping up all over
the place, and are set to continue doing so (although the planned Covent
Garden staging is rumoured to have been shelved).
Would similar attention be paid to the opera if it were by another
18th-century composer, and not by an extraordinarily precocious 14-year-old
who later composed Idomeneo? My answer, bolstered by knowledge of Mitridate
from records, concert performances, and now by this English Bach Festival
production, is a full-throated yes: for it is a work of extraordinary
qualities.
No-one would pretend that it is evenly inspired all the way through (though
even when treading 18th-century seria water, as he does for much of the
first act, Mozart writes with serene beauty for voices and instruments); but
the opera contains sufficient startling, fiery, and deep-felt music to
disprove Dent's assertion that in 1770 Mozart 'was not yet temperamentally
equal to the treatment of such a subject' as Racine's drama in Cigna-Santi's
libretto re-modelling.
It is an adventurous opera - adventurous with formal procedures, with
emotional statement and development, with its treatment of characterisation
through voices. Even at so tender an age Mozart was capable of taking a
'given' - such as the predilection of his leading tenor, Guglielmo D'Ettore,
for wide leaps from high to low or vice-versa - and turning it to dramatic
account: the fantasticated vocal line for the titular king certainly depicts
overweening pride. And the music for the principal pair of star-crossed
lovers, Siphare (castrato soprano) and Aspasia (prima donna soprano) is
vibrant with feeling.
One feels strongly about the riches of Mitridate above all in the wake of
this English Bach Festival presentation, which showed them off in an
admirably flattering light. A modernised treatment must surely encounter
greater difficulties with a work so bound up with 18th-century dramaturgy;
the EBF way of honouring the terms of that dramaturgy - in stage movement
(by Tom Hawke), in setting (by Terence Emery after Quaglio) - sets the scale
of the drama. One accepts its pace and style - and then, in later acts, one
thrills to Mozart's bold, excited re-thinking of them.
In the delightfully ornate, intimate Salle Garnier, the chances of such a
presentation are of course much more positive. It was not absolutely ideal:
the conductor of the EBF 'period' orchestra, Antonio de Almeida, is a
cultivated musician who tends to let the reins slacken just when one wants
him to tauten them. The casting was uneven: Helen Field (Aspasia) carried
herself and her grand dark-crimson gown with such wonderful presence that
her discomforts with florid writing were easily forgiven, but the
inexperienced Kiphare (Sharon Cooper, a soft-grained high mezzo) showed only
flashes of promise.
On the other hand, the Mitridate, Andreas Jaeggi, managed the normally
agonising arias with grace, dignity, and even ease; and both Penelope Walker
(the scheming Farnace) and Naomi Harvey (the gentle Ismene, second donna
foil to Aspasia) proved exceptionally stylish in delivery and bearing. The
long opera was cut to the bone, and beyond that in the secco recitative. But
on the whole the show was a notable success for both the Monte Carlo
Festival and the English Bach organisation: a pity it is apparently not to
be given in London.

SMOKER v LONDON FIRE AND CIVIL DEFENCE AUTHORITY
WOOD v BRITISH COAL CORPORATION
House of Lords (Lord McKay, Lord Chancellor, Lord Bridge of Harwich, Lord
Brandon of Oakbrook, Lord Templeman, Lord Lowry): April 11 1991
A DISABILITY pension to which an employee has contributed is a form of
insurance, and is therefore not deductible from damages payable to him by
his employer for personal injuries arising from the employer's negligence or
breach of statutory duty.
The House of Lords so held when dismissing an appeal by the London Fire and
Civil Defence Authority from Mr Justice Auld's decision that it could not
deduct ill-health and injury pensions and injury gratuity from damages for
personal injuries payable to its employee, Mr AF Smoker; and when dismissing
an appeal by the British Coal Corporation (BCC) from a Court of Appeal
decision that it could not deduct disability pension from damages payable to
its employee, Mr Roy Wood.
LORD TEMPLEMAN said that in the first appeal, Mr Smoker was employed as a
professional fireman by the Greater London Council.
On February 7 1985 he was disabled in an accident caused by his employer's
negligence or breach of statutory duty. He lost Pounds 13,525 which, but for
the accident, he would have earned between December 15 1985 and December 15
1987, when he would have retired.
Between December 15 1985 and December 15 1987 he received Pounds 9,926
ill-health pension, injury gratuity, and injury pension from the fire
authority.
The question was whether the authority must pay Pounds 13,525 for loss of
earnings, in which case Mr Smoker would be Pounds 9,926 better off than he
would have been had the accident not occurred, or whether it was only liable
to pay Pounds 3,598 on the ground that the damages must be reduced by the
amount of pension and gratuity received.
When Mr Smoker became a fireman he became a member of the Firemen's Pension
Scheme. He contributed 10.75 per cent of his wages to the scheme, and the
fire authority contributed twice as much.
In the second appeal, Mr Wood was injured on April 14 1982, in the service
of the BCC, in an accident for which the BCC was 75 per cent responsible.
The BCC's liability for damages was assessed at Pounds 54,959, after
deducting Pounds 8,699 on account of pension receipts to which Mr Wood
became entitled under the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme.
The question was whether the Pounds 8,699 was deductible.
Under the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme, Mr Wood contributed 5.14 per cent of
his pay, and the BCC contributed a like amount.
In Mr Smoker's case, Mr Justice Auld decided he was bound by a House of
Lords decision not to allow deduction of the pensions and gratuity. The fire
authority now appealed direct to the House. In Mr Wood's case the Court of
Appeal held that the pension receipts were not deductible from damages. The
BCC now appealed.
In Bradburn v Great Western Railway (1874) LR 10 Ex 1 it was held in a
personal injuries action that a sum received by the plaintiff under an
accident insurance policy could not be taken into account in reduction of
damages.
Baron Pigott said 'there is no reason or justice in setting off what the
plaintiff has entitled himself to under a contract . . . in the event of an
accident'.
In Payne v Railway Executive (1952) 1 KB 26 the Court of Appeal declined to
allow the defendant to set off disability pension against damages.
Lord Justice Cohen approved the trial judge's statement that: 'Just as the
wrongdoer cannot appropriate to himself the benefit of the premiums paid by
the injured party to cover accident risks, so he cannot appropriate the
benefits accruing from the injured party's service which similarly entitled
him to those benefits.'
In British Transport Commission v Gourley (1956) AC 185 the House of Lords
held that in awarding damages for loss of earnings the court must allow for
the tax the plaintiff would have had to pay.
Earl Jowett said the general principle governing assessment of damages was
that the injured party should be awarded such sum as would put him in the
same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the injuries.
He said 'There are . . . exceptional cases in which this dominant rule does
not apply, as for instance, in cases of insurance.'
In Browning v War Office (1963)(1963) 1 QB 750 the Court of Appeal by
majority held that disability pension must be taken into account in
assessing pecuniary loss. The majority relied on Gourley and disapproved
Payne.
In Parry v Cleaver (1970) AC 1 a police constable was severly injured by a
motor car driven negligently by the defendant and became entitled as of
right to a pension on being discharged from the police force for
disablement. The House held by three to two that the pension should be
ignored in assessing loss.
Lord Reid said that Gourley reaffirmed the rule that the plaintiff could not
recover more than he had lost; but it did not deal with sums which came to
the plaintiff as a result of the accident, and which would not have come to
him but for the accident.
He said: 'As regards moneys coming to the plaintiff under a contract of
insurance, the real and substantial reason for disregarding them is that the
plaintiff has bought them and that it would be unjust and unreasonable to
hold that the money which he prudently spent on premiums and the benefit
from it should enure to the benefit of the tortfeasor.'
He dealt with the nature of a contributory pension. He said the products of
the sums paid into the pension fund were in fact delayed remuneration for
current work. But the man did not get back in the end the accumulated sums
paid into the fund on his behalf.
He said: 'This is a form of insurance. Like every other kind of insurance,
what he gets back depends on how things turn out . . . I can see no relevant
difference between this and any other form of insurance. So, if insurance
benefits are not deductible in assessing damages . . . why should his
pension be deductible?'
The minority in Parry relied on the general principle in Gourley
In the present case the employers sought to distinguish Parry on the ground
that they were in the triple position of employers, tortfeasors and
insurers.
That made no difference to the principle that the employee had bought his
pension which was 'the fruit, through insurance, of all the money which was
set aside in the past in respect of his past work' (per Lord Reid).
The employers, failing to distinguish Parry, invited the House to depart
from it.
Lord Gardiner's practice statement (1966) 1 WLR 1234 announced that the
Lords of Appeal, while treating former House of Lords decisions as normally
binding, proposed to depart from a previous decision when it appeared right
to do so.
In Fitzleet Estates (1977) 1 WLR 1345 Lord Wilberforce, rejecting a plea to
depart from a previous decision reached by bare majority, commented that all
the arguments in favour of the appellant had been advanced in the previous
decision, and that there had been no change of circumstances.
In the present case all relevant authorities were cited and all relevant
arguments had been advanced in Parry and there had been no change of
circumstances.
The employers claimed there had been a change of circumstance in that Parry
introduced uncertainty in the law, and in that since 1970 there had been a
clear trend at common law against double recovery.
But Parry established clearly that pension benefits were not deductible and
that double recovery was not involved.
There was nothing in the authorities which cast doubt over the effect or
logic in Parry v Cleaver.
The appeals were dismissed.
Their Lordships agreed.
For Mr Smoker: Richard Clegg QC and Allan Gore (Robin Thompson &amp; Partners).
For the fire authority: John Samuels QC and Kerstin Boyd (Masons).
For Mr Wood: Richard Clegg QC and Simon Grenfell (Brian Thompson &amp; Partners,
Manchester).
For the BCC: Simon Hawksworth QC and Margaret Bickford-Smith (Nabarro
Nathanson).

FT  16 APR 91 / Management: Coming to terms with changing needs - A day's
events in Doncaster / Enterprise agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the weekly executive meeting at DonBAC, the enterprise agency and
business advice centre based in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, and the
three-man executive committee is discussing plans to expand the agency's
range of information services.
DonBAC is hoping to provide space in its already cramped offices for an
information officer from the local public library and for staff to operate a
telephone helpline on behalf of its area Training and Enterprise Council,
the Barnsley and Doncaster Tec.
Consideration of the plans has already been going on for 18 months and Brian
Crangle, DonBAC's chief executive, and his two fellow directors are keen to
press on. But recruitment of the librarian has been held up by a salary
review and slotting the data links and the extra telephone lines into
DonBAC's already crowded phone system is causing headaches.
The expansion of the agency's information service is just one of several
initiatives to be discussed at last week's two-hour meeting. Like many of
the 300 enterprise agencies around the country, DonBAC is attempting to come
to terms with rapid changes which are occurring in the field of small
business support.
The creation of a nationwide network of Training and Enterprise Councils and
a new-found vigour on the part of the Chambers of Commerce movement
represent at the same time an opportunity and a threat to the enterprise
agencies.
Meanwhile the winding-down of government funding for the enterprise agencies
and an increasingly demanding approach on the part of their private sector
sponsors are forcing the agencies to question their role. Can they continue
to function as a social service, providing free advice to the smallest
business, or must they adopt a tougher, more commercial approach?
Set up during the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Britain's enterprise
agencies originally saw their main role as providing advice to unemployed
people seeking to become self-employed or to establish small businesses.
Towards the end of the 1980s, though, the emphasis shifted to helping more
established businesses by providing training and financial support.
Nimrod Holdings, a manufacturer and retailer of computer games, is not
untypical of the companies helped by DonBAC. Alan Scott, a National
Westminster Bank manager on secondment to the agency, spent one morning last
week on a monitoring visit to Nimrod, which has 11 stores, 100 employees and
turnover of Pounds 2.8m. Scott's interest in the company arises from a
Pounds 24,000 loan which DonBAC has made to Nimrod's Appletree Print
subsidiary.
DonBAC was established in 1985 to help counter the rising unemployment
caused by pit closures in the south Yorkshire coalfield. It received a
significant boost in 1987 when British Rail provided Pounds 1.5m of funds to
help soften the impact of cut-backs in its engineering activities in the
Doncaster area. DonBAC has set up a loan fund with the money.
DonBAC also operates a venture capital fund which has Pounds 850,000 to
invest. The risks attached to venture capital are graphically illustrated,
however, by the failure in February of one of its two investments at a cost
to DonBAC of Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 170,000. The DonBAC team
underestimated the amount of time required to monitor equity investments,
concedes Bryce Staniland, financial executive.
The agency now has a staff of 12 people; all three of its executive
directors are employed on a permanent basis. This gives it a decided
advantage over agencies which depend on secondees to fill senior positions,
says Crangle.
Money is tight but DonBAC is self-sustaining on a budget which was Pounds
200,000 last year. Finance comes in the form of sponsorship from nearly 40
organisations, including the local council, British Coal and British Rail,
interest and fees from its lending activities and training fees.
DonBAC has its offices in a small arcade in central Doncaster. This gives it
a shopfront onto one of the town's busiest streets but the premises are
cramped and there are plans to move to a new site with the Tec and other
business advice groups to provide inquirers with a one-stop service.
It was the decision by the government to create a nationwide network of
Training and Enterprise Councils which has caused DonBAC and other
enterprise agencies the greatest amount of heart-searching in recent months.
Many enterprise agency directors wonder how the Tecs will interpret their
small business role and whether the two networks will be able to work
smoothly alongside each other.
An example of how the relationship can work is the contract which DonBAC has
won from the Barnsley and Doncaster Tec to provide business counselling
sessions. But Crangle and his team have been unable to agree with the Tec on
a plan to approve business plans submitted by applicants for the Tecs'
Business Start Scheme.
The Tec was keen for DonBAC to assess the business plans but was unwilling
to pay it for the service.
'We are used to giving advice to people on their business plans but we told
the Tec there was an extra effort involved in approving plans,' explains
Crangle. The Tec has now said its own staff will approve the business plans
but Crangle wonders if they are qualified to do this.
Despite these difficulties, Crangle says he is hopeful that the Tecs will
rapidly gain experience.
But the launch of the Tecs and the decentralisation of many
government-funded training programmes has posed further problems for
agencies like DonBAC. Spending cuts have hit DonBAC's training programmes
and reduced its income from this source over the past two years. Further
pressure on its finances have come from some of its sponsors who are
increasingly insisting on their backing being allocated to specific
programmes or projects. This threatens DonBAC's ability to provide its core
service - free advice and counselling to would-be entrepreneurs and small
businesses.
It is to counter these financial pressures that DonBAC is seeking to broaden
its range of services. Last week saw Derek Evans, DonBAC's training and
marketing director, providing a one-day pilot course to a group of 15
Midland Bank enterprise counsellors on how to deal with small business
clients. Evans believes Midland will decide to go ahead with the courses on
a regular basis.
DonBAC is also keen to expand its range with the creation of a franchising
centre to provide training, advice and finance to both franchisors and
franchisees. After the weekly executive meeting Evans goes into talks with
Brian Smart, executive director of the British Franchise Association.
The enterprise agency has been receiving a growing number of queries about
franchising while the association has been working for some time on opening
a centre to promote franchising. The franchise association wants to base its
centre in London but Evans and Smart discuss the possibility of Doncaster
serving the north-east as part of a support network of regional centres.
A third area where DonBAC is keen to expand is in the field of innovation
support. It recently became one of 14 agencies around the country to be
designated a 'gateway agency' providing help to inventors and innovative
small companies seeking advice on subjects such as patents and licensing.
Evans is working with John Gaskin, a DonBAC business counsellor with special
responsibility for innovation, on a one-day Inventors' Forum to be held on
April 30. If the forum is successful Evans hopes to stage similar events in
other towns in south Yorkshire and Humberside.
In an area which has been dominated by large industry,creating an
entrepreneurial climate has not been easy. Crangle believes, nevertheless,
that attitudes to enterprise have improved in recent years. Much more could
be done, though, if resources were not so limited. Getting the most value
from the resources available and avoiding wasteful overlaps will be the
challenge of the next few years.

FT  16 APR 91 / Management: A property strategy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Property is an unpopular subject with many managers because every time the
subject has to be addressed it appears to incur a cost but provides no
tangible benefit. A rent review invariably increases costs while finding a
use for a vacant space involves marketing and management time.
But this perception needs to be reconsidered, according to the Director's
Guide to Property.* Industry's spending on new buildings and infrastructure
is enormous - more than Pounds 24bn in 1989 - making property a resource
which should be managed properly to maximise its cost-effectiveness.
The cost of occupying and using property in the form of rent, rates,
mortgage payments and upkeep must be clearly identified and included in
budgets. Increases can be planned for by noting in advance the timing of
rent reviews and maintenance commitments imposed by leases.
Businessmen must take into account the time-scale of property transactions
when making strategic plans, the guide suggests. It takes time to find
property or buyers; there may be planning consents or building warrants to
obtain; and the price will have to be negotiated. Legislation stipulates
that local authorities must consider planning applications within two months
of receipt but this time limit is often exceeded because of the work loads
of planning departments.
The first step towards devising a strategy should be an audit of the
business's property assets, the guide says. Establish what the company
occupies and where it is. Is the tenure freehold or leasehold and if
leasehold for how long?
Are there any limitations on the use of the property? Title documents can
impose conditions which control future redevelopment and reduce the possible
sale or rental price. On the other hand a company may be able to increase
the value of its property by gaining planning consent for a change of use. A
site which can be developed for housing or a supermarket may be worth
considerably more than one in industrial use.

FT  16 APR 91 / Management: How to bridge the culture gap - Tips for
exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Successful exporting is not simply a question of learning the language. The
real problem for the exporter engaged in direct selling abroad is to
understand the culture, suggests George Young, author of The New Export
Marketer.*
To the European businessman or woman tight schedules are taken as a sign of
status and efficiency and an opposite number with an empty and endlessly
accommodating diary arouses suspicion. Expectations are often quite
otherwise in Asian or Middle Eastern countries where setting a prior
deadline or putting a guillotine on discussion may be seen as quite
insulting.
To be kept waiting in an outer office is seen by a Western businessman as a
snub but in Latin America to be kept waiting for an hour is of little
significance. The same attitude often applies to correspondence. A delay of
a month or two in a reply from a Japanese businessman does not necessarily
mean a loss of interest. It is often a sign that your proposition is being
investigated from every angle.
Greetings and leave-taking also vary in different cultures. The British do
not shake hands as much as many continental Europeans. In the Middle East,
in a casual encounter, men almost always shake hands on meeting, chat for a
few minutes and then shake hands on leaving. A second encounter on the same
day would follow the same sequence.
The subjects which can be brought up in 'warm-up' conversations must be
chosen carefully. A Frenchman would be acutely embarrassed if you raised the
issue of the financial status of his company while a Canadian would not
think twice, Young suggests. An Arab would be upset by being asked about his
wife and children in casual conversation; an American would react
differently.
Small businesses are unlikely to have the resources to afford the cultural
training undertaken by some large companies but by consulting libraries,
making exploratory visits and noting the accounts of experienced travellers
valuable knowledge can be gained.
Elsewhere in this volume the author looks at issues such as market research,
export pricing, promotion and dealing with export administration.

A leaflet* intended to help small business owners counter the impact of
changes in the Statutory Sick Pay legislation has been produced by the
National Federation of Self Employed and Small Businesses. The changes,
which came into effect on April 6, reduced the employer's sick pay rebate
from 100 to 80 per cent.
The guide, called Employers - do you know the true cost?, suggests that
companies which have no fixed agreement to top up sick pay and where no
precedent has been set should substitute a cash amount for a period of weeks
when devising new sick pay schemes. This would set a limit on payments if in
the future the government decides to make further changes to the rules.
Employers should also consider a closer medical screening of new employees,
it urges. The guide includes a model draft letter to employees explaining
the recent changes.

FT  16 APR 91 / Technology (Technically Speaking): Academics and value for
money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID FISHLOCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Harry Beckers, former group research co-ordinator for Royal Dutch-Shell,
used to tell his scientists a story about the difference between physicists
and chemists. The tale likened the physicists to dragonflies hovering just
above a dung-heap, and chemists to beetles burrowing in the mire.
Neither kind of scientist quite knows whether to be flattered or insulted by
the image. The point is that neither the dilettante dragonfly nor the
burrowing beetle has a good overall view of research objectives. Both can
read the situation quite wrongly, leaving gaping holes in perspective that
management must constantly strive to repair.
A textbook example of such academic short-sightedness is unfolding this year
in the UK at the Nuclear Structures Facility (NSF) at the Daresbury
Laboratory near Chester, where physicists study the make-up of the atomic
nucleus. The Science and Engineering Research Council (Serc), which funds
the operation, has rightly decided to close it down at the end of next year
because its focus is too narrow to warrant the Pounds 6.6m a year needed to
keep it running.
Nevertheless, Serc has failed to convince the physicists who use the the NSF
that its continued operation cannot be justified. These physicists are now
appealing to politicians and journalists to help overturn Serc's decision.
Unlike the much larger synchotron radiation source at Daresbury - a sort of
giant X-ray machine used by scientists of all disciplines - the NSF is used
only by nuclear physicists, not by chemists or biologists or medical
scientists, and not at all by industrial scientists. Its future concerns
only a handful of physicists and perhaps a score of engineering staff who
maintain the complex atom-smashing machine housed there.
Other countries have shown no interest in sharing its costs: both France and
Germany have their own facilities pursuing similar research. In addition,
NSF fails to rate even a mention in a 45-page summary of a quarter-century
of scientific achievements published last year by Serc.
Faced with having to cut the national nuclear research budget by 10 per
cent, the council has decided that the funds allocated to NSF have to go.
Approximately Pounds 50m of the total nuclear research budget of Pounds 80m
is committed to the 12-nation European Laboratory for Particle Physics in
Switzerland.
The NSF scientists claim it is a case of 'big science' - such as the Cern
project - losing to 'small science'. Sir Mark Richmond, Serc's chairman,
says the decision is not as simple as that; some of the most expensive
instruments of big science are used regularly by other kinds of scientist.
The latest ploy of the aggrieved parties is to try to cast doubt on the
competence and integrity of Sir David Phillips, chief scientific adviser at
the Department of Education and Science (source of Serc's funds). They
suggest that he is too old for the job - he is 51.
As Beckers at Shell saw so clearly, most researchers are driven not by some
grand cosmic dream of explaining everything but by much narrower ambitions
to which their own personal discipline and expertise might contribute.
Few scientists want to be managers while they are still finding research
itself so much fun. Few research managers take the trouble to explain
themselves and their decisions to their researchers as well as to their
paymasters.
However much scientists may wish it were not so, someone must control and
audit the very large sums of cash made available for scientific research
nowadays. Someone must ask nasty questions like: are we getting best value
for money?

FT  16 APR 91 / Technology: Inmos chip increases its range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO YEARS ago, Inmos, a gifted British semiconductor company not much
appreciated in its own country, was acquired by SGS-Thomson, which is
ultimately owned by the French and Italian governments.
Pasquale Pistorio, SGS-Thomson's president, visited Inmos's Bristol
headquarters shortly after the acquisition and asked its executives: 'What
would you like to do?'
Yesterday, in London, Inmos unveiled one of the answers to that question:
the T9000 transputer, an advanced version of the 'computer on a chip' for
which it is best known.
Earlier versions of the transputer could communicate with four other
transputers, allowing different electronic operations to be carried out at
the same time rather than having to be processed consecutively.
A programmer could arrange for the older transputers to communicate with
more than four other devices. Users of the T9000 do not need to make this
adjustment. Paul Strzelecki, Inmos's marketing director, says that although
the new transputer still has four communications channels, there is no limit
to the number of other transputers or electronic devices with which it can
work.
The new product, which previously went under the code name H1, will be
commercially available at the end of this year. Inmos would not reveal the
price of the T9000, but it is initially likely to be sold for about Dollars
400. The company is expected to reduce the price as sales take off.
Strzelecki said he expects the new transputer to be used by
telecommunications manufacturers. It can also be used in products like laser
printers and colour facsimile machines.
Inmos yesterday produced colour photographs transmitted by a Sharp colour
fax machine using the older T400 transputer. The high-resolution pictures
were transmitted along ordinary phone lines, a process which took six
minutes. The advanced T9000 will be able to transmit the pictures by fax in
less than half a minute, Strzelecki said.

FT  16 APR 91 / Technology: Calls by a voice from the post - Mailbox
messaging equipment can save time and money for businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With all the communications equipment on the market today, from carphones to
satellite telex machines, it may seem curious that up to 75 per cent of
calls never get through to the right person. Instead the frustrated caller
is bombarded with the continuous ringing or engaged tone or ends up leaving
a message that may never be answered.
In the US, but not widely yet in Europe, a technology is being used which
helps to eliminate this problem - voice messaging or voice mail, where
recorded messages can be left on a central recording device to be picked up
the recipient.
Nigel Southon, general manager of voice messaging for British Telecom in the
UK, equates voice messaging to a spoken memo - a way of leaving messages
without sticking numerous bits of paper on someone's desk. 'It's for closed
user groups in medium-sized or large companies who want to replace paper
with voice. My paperwork has gone down by between a third to a half by using
it,' he says.
Several surveys carried out by companies in the US demonstrate the cost
advantages of voice messaging, says Laura Macias, market development manager
with Octel, a US voice messaging equipment manufacturer. She cites the case
of General Electric which concluded that the company could save Dollars
1,100 per year for each of its 60,000 employees by using voice messaging.
'Many companies experience payback on equipment in less than a year.'
One company that has pioneered the use of voice messaging, both in the US
and Europe, is 3M, the materials group.
Malcolm Wollaston, telecommunications manager for Europe, explains that in
the UK 50 sales staff in the abrasives technology group were the first to
use voice messaging, but now there are 400 3M users in the UK and this
figure could soon rise to 1,000. In the US 12,000 3M employees already use
voice messaging.
As well as improving internal communications, 3M sales people give clients
their voice messaging numbers and personal identification number along with
their ordinary phone numbers. By phoning the number and keying in the Pin on
the phone touchpad, the client is prompted to leave a message requesting
information, giving an order or demanding help. This information is
digitised and stored on a computer hard disc.
Wollaston emphasises the need for proper training for those with mailboxes,
not just in the technology but in how to get the best business advantage out
of the system. For example, sales staff are told that they must phone in to
collect their messages - which are automatically played back to them - every
two hours. This way customers can be confident that they will get a swift
response to inquiries.
For Wollaston, voice messaging is only one way to maintain communications
with people on the road. As such competes directly with cellular phones and
radiopagers, and he has calculated the comparative costs of the three.
Despite the plummeting costs of cellular radio hardware, Wollaston estimates
that the running costs for each phone user are about Pounds 700 a year,
taking initial purchase, subscription charges and calls into consideration.
Depending on the geographical area covered, radiopagers can cost between
Pounds 200 and Pounds 700 to run as well. Voice messaging services cost 3M
about Pounds 360 per person. Wollaston cites further advantages:
A single bill is sent to the company - with carphones you get a bill for
each phone.
Management statistics can be compiled much more easily as a result.
The number given can be a toll-free number if required, so there is no
expense to the caller. This means that company sales people, say, can avoid
the high call charges imposed by many hotels.
However, Wollaston acknowledges that different communications means are
appropriate for different users in different situations. Voice messaging is
most useful where people need to communicate specific information, or where
managers want to send out a single message to a number of employees (the
message can be duplicated electronically). And if the message needs to be
sent on from one person's mailbox to another, that can be done by pressing a
few buttons.
Anybody who has phoned a business in the US to be greeted by a recorded
message has experienced the simplest manifestation of voice messaging: that
of a corporate answering machine where unanswered phone calls via the office
telephone system are routed to the voice messaging system.
Southon reports increasing interest from companies whose staff are 'site
mobile' - managers in retail stores, hotels or restaurants who are rarely in
their offices.
Voice messaging is also proving useful for companies which operate across
international boundaries and time zones. Glaxo, Britain's largest
pharmaceutical company, for example, uses voice messaging to enable
employees in its subsidiary offices in the Mediterranean and Middle East to
call into the UK and leave messages outside the traditional UK working
hours. Voice messaging systems can also store messages and transmit them
when off-peak phone rates are in operation.
For small organisations such as the Technology Broker, a company with fewer
than 10 employees who flit between the two main offices in California and
London, voice messaging is one of the few satisfactory ways of doing
business.
Annie Brooking, managing director of the company, explains that she rents a
mailbox on an American-based service where clients can leave messages for
her. Then she rents further mailboxes for each of her larger clients so that
she can leave messages for them. 'I have one client who I sometimes won't
see for six months. But I speak to him every day,' she says.
For smaller companies, renting voice mailboxes from a service provider is
the only option. Larger companies can opt to rent the service or buy their
own voice messaging hardware to install alongside their corporate telephone
exchange. In the UK 3M rents its service from British Telecom but is
considering moving to an in-house machine to reduce costs. 'In the US it
costs about Dollars 4 per user per month on an in-house system,' reports
Wollaston.
In the US large companies often opt to use a combination of the two, buying
equipment for their biggest offices and renting bureau services for their
smaller regional offices.
But in Europe it is only recently, with the liberalisation of
telecommunications, the falling costs of hardware and the cultural
acceptance of recorded messages that businesses have begun to accept voice
messaging. European business exchange manufacturers such as Ericsson, GPT
and Siemens are now set to compete in the voice messaging market with US
manufacturers such as Octel, AT&amp;T, Voice Mail Systems and Northern Telecom.
One factor which may encourage further growth is an agreement of standards
to enable voice messaging equipment from one maker to communicate with that
from another.
But although US companies took to voice messaging like ducks to water, they
are only now realising some of the drawbacks. In the US hackers have begun
to target voice messaging networks, some to gain commercial advantage.
More sinister, says Adam Greenberg, editor of the voice processing
newsletter of Probe Research, the US consultancy based in Cedar Knolls, New
Jersey, which specialises in voice messaging, is the infiltration of company
messaging systems by drug dealers.
They set up their own mailboxes, with private Pin numbers, where they leave
details of drug availability and prices. Frequently they use networks with
toll-free numbers - so the company not only unwittingly promotes the sale of
drugs, but pays for the privilege as well.

FT  16 APR 91 / Scots tests strongly opposed by parents and teachers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SCOTLAND, well over half of all pupils do not take part in compulsory
primary school testing as a result of opposition from parent and teachers
alike, James Buxton writes. The Scottish Office is impotent to influence
events.
In Strathclyde Region, which accounts for nearly half the Scottish
population, more than 65 per cent of parents have withdrawn their children
from the tests, which are being applied to seven and 11-year-olds in English
and mathematics.
Similar withdrawal rates are reported from several other regions.
Many teachers are refusing to administer the tests, raising the likelihood
of disciplinary action by their employers, the regional councils.
In what is becoming a political and educational disaster for the government,
the Scottish Office has found it cannot oblige children to sit the tests.
They are subject to different legislation from that in England.
Parents and teachers object to the tests because they believe they threaten
to dilute the universal comprehensive system in Scotland, leading to crude
comparisons between schools and between pupils.

FT  16 APR 91 / TV-am to discuss links with Sky news operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TV-AM, THE breakfast television company, plans to explore links with Sky
News, the 24-hour satellite news channel, when the current franchise bids
finish.
There have already been talks between Mr Bruce Gyngell, TV-am managing
director, and Mr Sam Chisholm, managing director of British Sky
Broadcasting, on potential co-operation.
Both are directors of the Channel 9 television network in Australia and see
opportunities for economies of scale in their UK television news operations.
For example, although TV-am broadcasts just under 3 1/2 hours a day, its
news operation has to be staffed round the clock.
Mr Gyngell is concentrating on regaining the breakfast franchise and will
bid on the existing structure of news provision, but he clearly believes
that co-operation with Sky and the resulting savings could avoid affecting
the station's programme obligations. That could enable TV-am to bid higher
in the competitive tenders that will decide the franchises.
A link with TV-am might help BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, publisher
of the Financial Times, has a significant stake, to cut the costs of its
news service. In spite of the cost, senior management at BSkyB see Sky News
as an integral part of its five-channel service.
TV-am is likely to face two well-funded rivals for its franchise.

FT  16 APR 91 / First fraud case data published by SIB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECURITIES and Investments Board, the financial services regulatory
body, has carried out more than 600 investigations since it was created
three years ago. Of those, four have led to convictions, it disclosed
yesterday.
Twenty cases of unauthorised trading involving several million pounds of
investors' money are at various stages of investigation or trial. Two more
cases are to be tried this year.
The SIB's first reported statistics since its inception in 1988 showed the
state of breaches of Section Four of the 1986 Financial Services Act. That
section requires anyone carrying out investment business to be authorised by
the SIB.
'We think we have acted promptly after notification of possible frauds,'
said Mr Jeff Thomas, deputy director of the enforcement division. 'But
clearly there is a lot of fraud not yet detected.'
Officials pointed out that only about half the cases referred to the SIB
turned out to involve an investment business. They warned that individual
investors should be more vigilant.
Mr Thomas said investors should seek proof that the firm was authorised, and
be suspicious of any businesses offering unusually high returns. Most
defrauders do not advertise, he added.

FT  16 APR 91 / Japan appreciates its art - Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR generations Japanese prints were regarded as works of art in the west
but as little more than scraps of paper in 20th-century Japan. That is now
changing, so much so that Sotheby's decided to sell the fine collection of
Dr Walter Amstutz, the Swiss mountaineer and publisher, in Tokyo yesterday.
With Japan rocked by scandals over the false values given by companies to
their art purchases, and the economy off the boil, the auction did not do as
well as expected - but the total of Pounds 2.1m, with 24 per cent unsold,
was reasonable.
The top price was the Pounds 241,886 paid by a Japanese dealer for a
portrait by Tosusai Sharaku of the actor Iwai Hanshiro IV in the role of a
woman - the practice in late 18th-century Japan - which was above its high
estimate. A very similar print by the same artist was within forecast at
Pounds 206,051.
The big names among landscape artists, notably Hokusai and Hiroshige, sold
well, but the Japanese were not interested in well designed prints where the
colours had faded. A record price of Pounds 64,951 was paid for a print of
salt maidens at a beach by Harunobu and the Pounds 62,711 paid for a print
of an actor by Shunko was a record for his work.
In Geneva on Sunday, auction house Hapsburg sold the Art of Breguet, a
comprehensive collection of 204 works by the famed Swiss clock and
watchmaker, for Pounds 5.5m. The auction was 25 per cent unsold by value.
A carriage clock, the first of its kind made by Breguet, which Napoleon
bought for 1,500 francs in 1798, sold for Pounds 321,950, but the top price
was Pounds 626,000 - the highest sum paid at auction for a wristwatch -
which secured the Sympathetique, a timepiece which is more like an
astronomical clock made in gold.
At the Isle of Wight the transport collection of Norman Ball was sold by
Sotheby's for Pounds 930,955, with only 13 per cent unsold, an achievement
at a time when the market for classic cars is particularly weak.
A 1925 Hispano-Suiza seven-seat tourer went for Pounds 110,000, below
estimate, as did a pair of Fowler BBI ploughing engines, both 70 years old,
which sold for Pounds 42,350. The horse-drawn caravan of 'Prince' Gypsy Lee,
who read palms in London's Portobello Road market for many years, was sold
to a New York telephone bidder for Pounds 5,060.

FT  16 APR 91 / Collor ends price freeze but maintains controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL is to start lifting its 10-week-old price freeze today, returning to
the system of price controls dropped by President Fernando Collor last year.
Increases will be based on inflation forecasts rather than past costs and be
decided on a sector-wide basis by selected groups of businessmen, unions and
government officials.
Price controls run contrary to President Fernando Collor's government's
commitment to a free market. But Mr Antonio Kandir, Brazil's chief economic
policy maker, said: 'We must keep controls until we have some stability. We
cannot lift controls while there are still 20 per cent of businesses
doubting us because those 20 per cent will immediately put up prices fearing
another freeze and set us back on the inflationary spiral.'
The price freeze is the fifth in five years. Previous attempts have been
widely criticised because the moment they are lifted inflation starts to
rise again.
Mr Kandir defended the freeze. 'We were heading for hyper-inflation and had
no option but to reduce inflation in this artificial manner.'

FT  16 APR 91 / Court threat to Brazil's inflation fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB

<DATELINE>
   BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian government's battle against inflation is threatened by
regional court decisions declaring unconstitutional its seizure of 80 per
cent of the nation's assets and savings in March last year.
In the first few months following the freeze many companies succeeded in
liberating their funds, out of an estimated Dollars 80bn blocked. However,
the government still holds 6.4 trillion (million million) new cruzados -
about Dollars 28bn or the equivalent of 6 per cent of gross domestic
product. It is committed to start paying this back in 12 monthly payments
from September 16.
However, in the last two weeks courts in Recife and Sao Paulo have ruled
unanimously that the freezing was unconstitutional and that the money should
be paid back immediately. Courts in Rio and Braslia are expected to follow
suit.
Polls show that the majority of the population is sceptical of the
government's promise to start paying back the frozen funds in September.
Thousands of people have already succeeded in gaining access to their money
through individual court actions - according to the central bank's legal
department there are 40,000 cases pending. The recent regional court
decisions means the process is speeding up.
The central bank, fearing the explosion in the monetary supply that would be
caused by having to repay all the money at once, is to appeal to the Supreme
Court.
'This money is equivalent to 50 per cent of total current money supply,'
said Mr Luis Eduardo de Assis, the bank's head of monetary policy.
'Obviously if we have to pay it back instantaneously instead of the gradual
programme we intend it would have an immense impact and lead to a big
increase in inflation.'
It is not clear the Supreme Court will rule in the government's favour but
Braslia at least hopes to delay a decision. Mr Marcio Moraes, one of the Sao
Paulo judges, said the blocking was an act of force not a legal act.
'If it had been done by an individual it would be robbery. As it was done by
the government it is a crime against the constitution.'

MEXICO and Harvard University have agreed a Dollars 2.9m
'debt-for-scholarship' swap. Harvard will assume a portion of Mexico's
foreign debt to establish a fund for Mexican students to attend the
university and for Harvard students and staff to study and teach in Mexico.
Last July Harvard made a similar Dollars 5m agreement with Ecuador, the
first of its kind, based on the 'debt-for-nature' swaps which have funded
environmental projects.
The deal was signed last week by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
during his visit to the US to promote a North American free trade area
embracing the US, Canada and Mexico.
Harvard is to buy Mexican discount bonds, trading at about 68 per cent of
face value. The Dollars 2m invested in the bonds will be converted into
pesos at face value and subsequently into dollar accounts to fund the
programme. The fund is expected to provide grants for at least 100 students
and professors over the first 10 years.
Harvard president Derek Bok said the agreement was 'a crucial step that will
enable Harvard to increase its interaction with Mexico in order to better
understand and learn from its remarkable neighbour to the south'.

FT  16 APR 91 / Chilean fears over anti-terrorist unit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CHILE'S army is lobbying hard to be included in a new anti-terrorist unit,
raising fears that the dreaded CNI, the secret police of former dictator
General Augusto Pinochet, may soon be back in action.
The civilian government is this week expected to announce the creation of
the intelligence unit, formed from the ranks of the police.
The decision to set up an anti-terrorist intelligence unit comes after four
murders in as many weeks, including the assassination on April 1 of Senator
Jaime Guzman, a right-wing leader and staunch defender of the 1973-90
military regime.
President Patricio Aylwin's year-old civilian government has been thrown
off-guard by a surge in guerrilla revenge killings since the publication of
an official report last month that was highly critical of the armed forces'
human rights abuses under military rule.
The government says the new unit will be formed by Carabineros and
Investigaciones - two police organisations which have often been at
loggerheads. To dispel the spectre of a resurrected CNI, it says the new
unit will be headed by a civilian in the interior ministry. Its actions will
be also subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
But the army is mounting a campaign to be allowed in on the act. Last week,
Gen Pinochet briefed several leading congressmen, senators and government
ministers on the army's experience in combatting terrorism.
Retired Colonel Christian Labbe, Gen Pinochet's last government spokesman,
said: 'We need a centralised intelligence unit to defeat terrorism, not two
or three police groups gathering bits of information. The new unit should
include the military, as they have the most experience in this matter.'
The army admits that it reincorporated some 2,000 secret police agents when
the CNI was disbanded shortly before Gen Pinochet stepped down from power in
March 1990. It says the CNI files were destroyed. The new government was
left with no intelligence arm of its own.
This has led to widely different assessments of the guerrilla threat it is
facing: some reports speak of a hard core of 200 extreme leftists who
refused to lay down arms after democracy was restored. Others speak of up to
2,700 foreign-trained insurgents.
Two groups are known to be operating in the country: a splinter of the
Manuel Rodriguez Front, which claimed Senator Guzman's assassination, and a
shadowy group called Lautaro, which has progressed from Robin Hood antics
(distributing condoms in secondary schools and organising armed
demonstrations in Santiago's shanty towns) to bombings and killing police.
Both are thought to be infiltrated by ultra-right wingers linked to the
former CNI.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday warned that failure of the rail industry to
avert a strike called for midnight tonight could 'seriously disrupt' the US
economy just as it was 'trying to turn around and get out of this
recession'.
Most of the country's 235,000 freight line workers have threatened to walk
off their jobs if there is no breakthrough in a three-year-old dispute over
wages and health benefits. Lengthy bargaining sessions convened over the
weekend by the National Mediation Board failed to produce a settlement.
The president urged labour and management to resolve their differences.
He said a report issued by a presidential emergency board, which held eight
months of hearings, could provide a basis for settling the dispute.
'Because of the potential economy-wide disruption, it would be prudent that
all efforts and actions be taken to avoid the strike,' he said. 'My
administration is willing to work with the parties to help in any way
possible.'
Mr Bush did not, however, threaten to go to Congress which could pass a bill
ordering the strikers back to work. While he did not specifically threaten
legislative action to block a strike, he implied that the recommendations of
the emergency board could be imposed if the parties failed to resolve the
dispute voluntarily.
A walkout would affect all Americans as well as the hundreds of thousands of
rail workers, since the rail industry transported a third of all goods sold
in the US, Mr Bush said.
Union officials said talks appeared stalled between two key unions - the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the United Transportation Union -
and railroad management.
A total of 11 unions are at loggerheads with railroad management.

EC FOREIGN ministers yesterday decided to ask Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar,
the United Nations secretary general, about the feasibility of bringing
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to book for war crimes.
Following up an emotional plea from Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German
foreign minister, it was agreed to seek ways in which President Saddam
'could be called personally to account for his responsibility for invading
two countries - Iran and then Kuwait, for mounting genocide against the
Kurds and for the use of chemical weapons,' according to Mr Tristan
Garel-Jones, Britain's EC affairs minister.
Later today Mr Jacques Poos, foreign minister of Luxembourg which holds the
EC presidency, will see Mr Perez de Cuellar at the European Parliament in
Strasbourg, and ask him to examine under which legal instruments Mr Saddam
might be brought to account.
Mr Garel-Jones said it was for the UN, not for the EC, to decide how the
Iraqi leader might be tried - by special UN tribunal, or the national courts
of a signatory country of the UN genocide pact, or even in absentia.
Iraqi-Kurdish issues are expected to figure at a meeting here tomorrow
between EC foreign ministers, and their American counterpart, Mr James
Baker, which will mainly focus on a possible EC role in the regional
Arab-Israeli peace conference Washington is hoping to convene.

FT  16 APR 91 / Gulf war cost Asian countries Dollars 1.2bn exports and
remittances
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Asian Development Bank (ADB) reported yesterday that the Gulf crisis had
cost its developing member countries more than Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 670m)
in lost exports and forgone foreign exchange remittances from migrant
workers.
Added to that is the higher oil price after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. That
cost runs into many billions of dollars for Asia's many net oil importers,
the ADB says in its annual report, released yesterday before the bank's
annual meeting in Vancouver on April 24-26.
Oil exporters Indonesia and Malaysia benefited in the short run from the
higher world oil prices, the report said, but for China, another exporter,
'the loss of remittances and construction contracts wrote off most of the
gains'.
Before the Gulf crisis there has been about 600,000 Asian workers in Kuwait
and Iraq. 'A large number of them were later repatriated, considerably
reducing the inflow of remittances and adding to the unemployment problem
back home,' says the ADB.
The South Asian countries and the Philippines were particularly hard hit
because of their close economic relations with the Middle East. 'Their
problems were compounded by their big budget and current account deficits
and relatively high inflation rates and debt-service ratios,' the ADB report
adds.
The bank estimated that the crisis had reduced India's growth in 1990 by one
or two percentage points and increased its oil bill by more than Dollars
1bn.
It said the total cost of the crisis to Pakistan was close to Dollars 1bn.
'These countries will need substantial external assistance to avoid
stagflation and keep their balance of payments manageable.'
'The newly industrialising economies (NIEs) were in a much better position
than other developing member countries to absorb the shock,' the 50-member
bank said.
Loans and investments approved by the bank grew by 9 per cent to Dollars
4.01bn in 1990, according to the report.
Of the total operation, loans to public and private sectors amounted to
Dollars 3.97bn for 57 projects. Project loans accounted for Dollars 2.2bn,
or 56 per cent, of the loan volume, programme loans Dollars 820m, or 21 per
cent, sector loans Dollars 441m, or 11 per cent, credit lines Dollars 411m,
or 10 per cent, and direct priv-ate sector loans Dollars 79m, or 2 per cent.

FT  16 APR 91 / Suffering and betrayal in Mogadishu: Somalis believe the
outside world has abandoned them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOGADISHU has been devastated by the war, particularly the heavy tank and
artillery shelling unleashed indiscriminately in January from Villa Somalia.
Few buildings remain unmarked by bullet or grenade fire. Almost every home
and factory has been gutted in an orgy of looting.
The Mogadishu abbatoir recently constructed with Italian aid money has been
disembowelled. Cables were ripped out, walls and corrugated iron sheets torn
down and useless hunks of metal machinery carried off by looters.
Help is desperately needed. But when the war broke out foreign governments,
United Nations organisations and aid agencies scrambled out of Mogadishu as
fast as possible. Only Medecins Sans Frontieres, Save the Children Fund UK
and the Red Cross have returned with a few expatriates and minimal supplies.
Food, fuel, drugs and water are extremely scarce. Fears of an outbreak of
cholera, measles and malaria epidemics are rising with the approach of the
rains later this month.
'The world has put a humanitarian embargo on us,' said Mr Nurelmi Osman, the
acting Health Minister. 'We are asking for food and drugs not guns, for
tents not tanks. People are suffering. It will be a disaster.'
Somalis feely deeply betrayed by the desertion of the international
community, particularly the US and Italy which for years shored up the
regime of former President Mohammed Siad Barre with guns and money. And
Somalis have showed their anger the Mogadishu way.
The US embassy, recently finished at the cost of Dollars 40m (Pounds 22m),
was completely wrecked and looted. So was the Catholic Cathedral where the
friezes of Christ and the Madonna were sprayed with bullets, the roof torn
off and the marble font and altar destroyed. 'Italy was a very bad people
because they like Siad Barre,' is scrawled in black paint on one of the
walls.
'Our society is deeply demoralised by the actions of Italy and the US
government,' said Miss Mariam Arif, a businesswoman from the Hawiye clan,
the overwhelming majority in Mogadishu which suffered most at the hands of
Mr Barre's security forces. 'They have abandoned us and left us flat. What
did the innocent suffering people of Mogadishu do against them?'
United Somali Congress officials say an Italian government delegation lead
by Mr Umberto Plaja promised emergency help to repair the communications
system but has failed to deliver.
They also accuse Kenya of directly supporting the Darod clan (Mr Barre's
rule favoured his own Marehan tribe, a sub-clan of the Darod). They say
Kenya gave the Darod military aid and blocked relief flights to Mogadishu
because of links between senior military figures with the Darod clans,
business ties and a fear in Kenya of having a multi-party system on its
borders.
Foreign governments deny that they are supporting the Darods. But they, and
UN agencies, excuse their lack of humanitarian assistance saying they cannot
yet recognise the provisional United Somali Congress government and that
Mogadishu is too insecure.
'That's bullshit,' said Mr Willie Huber, the Somalia representative of SOS,
an international aid organisation, who stayed in Mogadishu throughout the
war running a hospital for the wounded.
Mr Huber, an indefatigable humanitarian, lived through the worst of the war
as other relief workers fled the war-torn city. He gathered several hundred
Somalis together in the SOS compound.
'I said if we stayed together we could protect each other. After that I
couldn't leave. To do so would have been a crazy betrayal.'
Mr Huber is now in charge of the only regular relief flights coming into the
country, a Belgian Hercules C130 which flies into Mogadishu five times a
week with 18 tons of food, fuel and medical supplies which SOS distributes
across the city. This only link to the outside world and to regular,
although meagre emergency relief, has given him a position almost as
powerful and important as that of president.
But he is fighting a battle to get funding from the European Community to
keep the lifeline open. And he despairs about the absence of basic
assistance for the thousands of people on the brink of death. 'Its a
disgrace,' he said.
As the international community stands by and Somalia plunges deeper into
disaster, a feeling of helplessness is mounting in Mogadishu.
'What can we do,' says a teenage USC member who had just driven two wounded
fighters back from the front. 'If we were in the Gulf it would be different
but this is Africa. Nobody cares.'
This is the second of two articles on Somalia. The first appeared yesterday

FT  16 APR 91 / Japanese stifle a yawn at Gorbachev visit
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WELL BEFORE Mr Gorbachev was due to arrive in Tokyo today for his first-ever
visit to Japan, most Japanese had been cured of Gorbymania.
The craze for Gorbachev look-alike dolls, for holidays in the Soviet Union
and books about perestroika passed about a year ago. Department stores,
which normally mark the visit of foreign dignitaries with displays of their
country's goods, are barely bothering to put on a show for Mr Gorbachev.
Seibu, a leading chain, says: 'Soviet things are selling rather slowly.
Buyers are not interested.'
One reason is a lack of suitable products: Seibu's limited range includes
vodka, brandy and Soviet military watches. Another is lack of organisation:
the promoters of a show of Soviet culture had to make do with a troupe of
Japanese dancers after the Russian ensemble they originally hired failed to
get visas in time.
Japanese politicians and journalists have tried to clothe the Soviet
leader's visit with the sense of historic importance which it undoubtedly
deserves.
The programme includes a banquet with Emperor Akihito and the Empress, no
fewer than three meetings with Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the Japanese prime
minister, a speech to the Japanese parliament and a reception for 2,500
VIPs. The Soviet leader is to present a medal to Mr Akira Kurosawa, the
internationally acclaimed film director.
Newspapers have been filled with long accounts of the territorial row which
has blighted relations between the two countries since 1945. Around 8,000
journalists have been despatched to cover Mr Gorbachev's every move.
Japanese television plans blanket coverage of the trip, interspersed with
film of the bleak islands off northern Japan which are at the heart of the
territorial dispute.
Yet the average Japanese does not expect much to come out of the visit.
According to a poll by NHK, the national television station, only 7 per cent
of people believe there will be a great change in bilateral relations. Even
nationalist groups which have been protesting for years about the disputed
islands do not attach great significance to the trip. They planned a modest
demonstration for 2,000 people, well away from anywhere Mr Gorbachev might
see them.
In a strange way, foreign ministry officials are quite pleased Mr Gorbachev
has not caused a greater stir. The Soviet leader is not expected to bring
with him an immediate settlement of the territorial question; at best he may
promise to start looking for a settlement. Japanese are wise not to be swept
off their feet by the mere sight of the great man.

FT  16 APR 91 / Iraqi oil refinery resumes output after three months
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ'S largest oil refinery at Baiji started production this week after
being forced to shut for three months by allied bombing raids in the Gulf
war, according to the Baghdad newspaper, Al-Thawra.
The newspaper said the refinery in north central Iraq would reach its full
capacity output of 200,000 barrels a day by the end of May after some of its
installations were almost totally destroyed in the Gulf war. Allied
commanders said they had destroyed 80 per cent of Iraq's oil refining
capacity in the Gulf war although this figure was questioned.
The Baiji refinery should be producing 100,000 litres of petrol, 3.5m litres
of jet fuel and 4.5m litres of diesel by next week, the newspaper said.
Almost all oil products are rationed although the Iraqi news agency said
this week that the country would be able to meet its domestic fuel needs in
the next few weeks.
Iraqi oil consumption was running at 300,000 b/d before the war. The country
remains barred from export by United Nations' sanctions and export pipelines
through Turkey and Saudi Arabia are closed.
President Saddam Hussein was pictured on Iraqi television on Sunday at the
Daura oil refinery near Baghdad inspecting reconstruction.

FT  16 APR 91 / World Trade News: Brazil and Iran discover ideal partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRASILIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT the time of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait last August Brazilian
officials were, with remarkable foresight, already negotiating a deal to
replace Iraq with Iran as the country's second largest oil supplier.
Both sides insist the timing was mere coincidence but once the UN sanctions
were announced outlawing commerce with Iraq, Brazil knew exactly where to
look to substitute its major trading partner in the Middle East.
Results were immediate. Last year Brazil's exports to Iran rose by 50 per
cent to Dollars 425m - 40 per cent of its sales to the Gulf region  - while
those to Iraq dropped 68 per cent to Dollars 110m. This year Brazil is
expecting an even greater rise. Mr Marcos Azambuja, director general of the
Brazilian Foreign Office, says: 'It has proved easier than we thought to
replace the Iraq market. Our whole strategy now is to make Iran our major
Gulf partner.'
There is more at stake than simply sales of food and raw materials. Last
October Mr Ozires Silva, Brazil's then infrastructure minister, led a
mission of businessmen to Tehran to offer expertise for the reconstruction
of Iran after eight years of war with Iraq and the building of an industrial
complex near the mouth of the Hormuz Strait.
The Brazilian mission was given a red carpet welcome including meetings with
12 ministers. Brazil's role as a big arms supplier to the opposite side
during the Iran-Iraq war was forgotten with the signing of a second oil
contract for a further 100,000 barrels per day making a total of 220,000.
Officials came back with the news that Brazil could capture Dollars 12bn in
contracts over the next five years both from the Iranian government and
private sector.
In many ways it is an ideal partnership. Brazil's perceived fencesitting
during the Gulf war has ruled out any hope of it gaining contracts in Kuwait
though Mr Azambuja insists 'the Brazil-Iraq connection was overblown'.
Iran's still uneasy relations with the US and Europe means Brazil with its
considerable experience in large development projects is the perfect
solution.
Already this year Brazil has welcomed eight Iranian missions including the
ministers for mining, energy, heavy industry and agriculture, all dangling
large contracts for the construction of steel and sugar mills, roads and
railways and hydro-electric projects.
It is not just talk. Although last year Brazil was in deficit in trade with
Iran because of escalating oil prices, since October an estimated Dollars
800m of export contracts have been signed for the supply of sugar, steel,
food and ten Tucano trainers. Agromachinery makers Caterpillar and Maxion
have signed accords and two of Brazil's biggest capital goods producers,
rivals Zanini and Dedini, have joined forces to build sugar mills in Iran.
Construction company Andrade Guterriez is expected to soon sign a Dollars
350m contract to build a Dollars 1.4bn hydroelectric dam in consortium with
Siemens and the Soviet company, Technopromoexport.

FT  16 APR 91 / World Trade News: Bush could lose vote on 'fast-track'
negotiating authority

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OPPOSITION to President Bush's proposed North American Free Trade Agreement
has grown to the point that his request for the extension of the 'fast
track' negotiating authority could be defeated in either house of Congress.
A coalition of labour, environmentalists, consumer groups, farm and church
organisations has been lobbying for months against the 'fast track' which
gives the administration power to negotiate trade agreements that Congress
cannot amend. However, the 'fast track' can be defeated if one house votes
against it.
The administration is so concerned that President Bush last week launched a
fierce attack on the opposition labelling those against the FTA 'fear
mongers' who practise 'defeatism.'
Yesterday, he warned that if he loses the fast track vote, 'we lose trade,
we lose jobs and jeopardise economic growth; we unleash horrifying new waves
of protectionism.'
Mr Mark Ritchie, one of the opposition leaders and president of the
Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, said at least 37 senators were
almost certain to support a resolution killing the 'fast track', introduced
by Senators Fritz Hollings of North Carolina and Kent Conrad of North
Dakota.
Another 28 senators are undecided. 'We just have to get 14 more to defeat
it,' Mr Ritchie said.
However, the opposition is divided over tactics. Some are moving to split
the resolution to defeat the fast-track request for the FTA but retain it
for the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
In the House, there is widespread confidence that the FTA could easily be
defeated if the two issues are separated.
President Salinas of Mexico last week urged approval of the FTA and promised
to address concerns about environmental enforcement and Mexican labour
practices. Business groups trooped up to Capitol Hill to extol the benefit
of an agreement which would create 'the largest market in the world' with
360m consumers and Dollars 6,000bn output.
Administration officials contend that defeat of the 'fast-track,' would kill
the Uruguay Round.
The opposition, led by the AFL-CIO, one of the main trade union groupings,
says it does not oppose free trade with Mexico. It calls the 'fast track'
device 'undemocratic' and wants more Congressional control over the
negotiations. It has little confidence in promises by the administration
that few US jobs will be lost and that concerns about food safety and labour
practices will be addressed.
Unions contend that the White House is pushing the Mexico FTA because it
helps big businesses that will profit by cross-border moves. The argument
plays well in public at a time of rising US unemployment.
In the end, the administration may seek a compromise to save the more than
four years of work on trade reform in the Uruguay Round talks.

FT  16 APR 91 / World Trade News: Chile makes US free trade pact a top
priority - Few practical obstacles stand in the way, but early success could
prove elusive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHILE is worried that its chances of reaching a Free Trade Agreement (FTA)
with the US may be scuppered if Mexico's trade negotiations with its
northern neighbour get bogged down over labour and environmental issues.
Reaching an FTA with its biggest trading partner has become Chile's foreign
policy priority. Santiago has even snubbed the overtures of Brazil and
Argentina to form a regional common market in order to concentrate on its
partnership with the US. But after the euphoria that greeted President
George Bush's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative last June, a new mood
of realism has begun to take hold in Santiago.
US officials are asking Chileans to be patient. If Congress grants President
Bush an extension of fast-track authority for trade agreements, Mrs Carla
Hills' small team of trade negotiators will be overstretched in just trying
to conclude the stalled Uruguay Round of talks under the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade and launching the Mexican negotiations.
Mr Bush also included his Americas Initiative within the fast-track
petition, but his aim to create a free trade area from Alaska to the
Antarctic remains a distant priority.
There are those within the State Department, however, who do not want to see
the Americas Initiative lost to the realm of good intentions. 'The concept
of free trade needs successes,' said one western diplomat in Santiago, 'and
the US must begin with countries like Chile, which are ready for it.'
There would be surprisingly few obstacles in the path of a US-Chilean FTA.
Their economies are complementary - Chilean fruit, for instance, does not
compete with US produce as it is exported during the northern hemisphere's
winter months. Chile already operates the most open foreign investment
regime in Latin America and it recently passed a law to protect intellectual
property rights to appease US pharmaceutical companies.
The greatest beneficiaries of an FTA in the US would be mining equipment
companies, which would gain a competitive edge over their European and
Japanese rivals in the race to supply almost 100 major mining projects being
developed in Chile. Contracts for equipment could run into several hundred
million dollars over the next four years.
Chile hopes that an FTA would accelerate its export-driven growth. Two-way
trade last year reached Dollars 2.84bn - 18 per cent of Chile's foreign
commerce. And even though Chile recognises that it is only a tiny market for
US goods, it is playing strongly on the Bush administration's need to have a
success in the region.
'Without a free trade accord with Chile, Bush's Enterprise for the Americas
Initiative is dead,' one Chilean official commented.
Within Chile, there is strong support for an FTA with the US. The American
Chamber of Commerce in Santiago has set up a task force with the
Confederation of Chilean Industry to co-ordinate the push for free trade.
They are getting advice from Mexican businessmen who have been lobbying
Washington.
Mr Danilo Lacallo, president of Esso-Chile, will be travelling to Washington
next month on behalf of the American Chamber of Commerce to set the ball
rolling.
'It is all a question of timing,' he says. 'We have to target congressmen
and employ professional lobbyists. But we also have to be cautious. If we
start pushing too soon, we may create antibodies against a deal with Chile.'
At the official level, Chilean and US trade negotiators will meet twice this
year, in May and in November, for consultations on which trade barriers
ought to be tackled and which special interest groups mollified. This forms
part of a framework agreement on free trade which was signed by Mr Alejandro
Foxley, Chile's finance minister, and Mrs Hills, the US trade
representative, last October. US officials believe that the outlines of an
FTA could be ready by the end of this year.
Chilean officials know that they must then bide their time and pray for the
Mexican negotiations to be successful. But if stumbling blocks arise there,
they hope that Washington will open up an avenue to allow trade talks with
Chile to be conducted simultaneously.

TOYOTA is negotiating to sell Volkswagen vehicles in Japan in expectation of
strong demand for imported models.
The negotiations come as EC representatives consider import levels for
Japanese cars after 1992, and despite a fall in sales of imported vehicles
in Japan this year, after seven years of rising sales.
Foreign makers claim the Japanese market remains partly closed, while
Japanese car makers want to prove that it is open and that they dominate
sales on merit. Imported vehicles comprised about 4 per cent of Japan's car
and truck market last year.
Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, the president of Toyota, said the company had been
considering a number of possibilities regarding imported vehicles, including
an agreement with Volkswagen. However, he said nothing had been decided.
Volkswagen and Audi have been among most successful of exporters to Japan,
but their sales have also declined this year. In March they sold 6,105
vehicles, down from 7,264 in March last year, while sales of imported cars
last month totalled 21,892 units, down from 25,727 a year earlier.
Toyota said the extent of the sales link-up would depend on the willingness
of Toyota dealers in Japan to handle foreign cars and that would be
determined by their expectations of sales.

<TEXT>
MALAYSIA has criticised Australia for blocking the entry of Malaysian-made
car batteries.
Ms Rafidah Aziz, the international trade and industry minister, said the
high duties imposed on the batteries, supposedly on anti-dumping grounds,
were arbitrary and amounted to a trade barrier. She said Malaysia would take
up the issue under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The Australian government recently announced that tariffs on cars, for
instance, were to be reduced from 35 per cent in 1992 to 15 per cent by
2000. But Mr Bob Hawke, the Australian prime minister, also warned foreign
producers he would take tougher anti-dumping measures and agreed to phase
out preferential trading arrangements with countries like Singapore and
Taiwan.
Malaysia's prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, has high hopes of building
up the motor industry. By promoting an extensive motor parts manufacturing
network through incentives such as tax holidays, and by raising local
content in cars to between 60 and 80 per cent, Malaysia hopes to be a
significant exporter by 1993.
The Malaysian complaint over the batteries adds to a growing list of
disputes which led to the suspension of senior level official contacts since
early this year.

FT  16 APR 91 / Reconstruction bank to start borrowing 'this summer'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development expects to start
borrowing on the world's capital markets this summer, according to Mr Anders
Ljungh, the EBRD's vice president for finance.
He told a group of bankers and journalists attending the EBRD inauguration
that the bank would also start accumulating liquid reserves around the same
time, which it would place with banks and in first class securities.
In this way, the London-based bank, which is being set up to help eastern
European nations develop market economies, will become an active participant
in financial markets.
Mr Ljungh said the bank would need to borrow because only 30 per cent of its
Ecu10bn (Pounds 6.9bn) capital would be paid in, and that over a five-year
period. But it would start borrowing before it actually needed the funds for
its lending operations. In this way it would build up its reserves.
He said that the EBRD would have to show that it was likely to make a profit
'fairly soon' to obtain and keep a high credit rating. It was currently in
discussions with rating agencies with the aim of winning 'triple A' status.
It would be 'natural' for the bank to borrow first in ecus, Mr Ljungh said.
But the bank would be flexible and he did not exclude raising funds in other
monies and swapping them to provide the convertible currencies that the
EBRD's borrowers would want.

FT  16 APR 91 / Yugoslav premier claims western support for reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY, East European Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Yugoslav prime minister, Mr Ante Markovic, who is facing growing
internal opposition, says he has the support of western governments for his
economic reforms and his attempts to hold the country together.
Some of the Yugoslav republics, notably Croatia and Serbia, remain
determined to topple him and will try to do so again on Friday when Mr
Markovic will ask the federal parliament who is for, and against, the
reforms.
Despite this dark shadow hanging over his future, Mr Markovic remains an
optimist.
'We have succeeded in passing through this difficult period. The recent
pledge of support - particularly from the United States and the European
Community - means that Yugoslavia now has a greater chance at becoming
integrated eventually into Europe,' he said.
President George Bush last month sent a letter to Mr Markovic, backing his
reforms.
In a wide-ranging interview in London, where he is attending the
inauguration of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Mr
Markovic, prime minister for the past two years ago, said that without
western support, the country would disintegrate.
'Such a Yugoslavia is in no western government's interest. For some time,
western governments adopted a 'wait and see attitude'. This played into the
hands of separatists who have exploited this lack of western support for the
federal government. It would have isolated Yugoslavia completely from
Europe, and from the main financial institutions which are necessary for the
reforms to succeed.'
Mr Markovic admitted that his reforms have had little effect over the past
year. His attempts to impose a strict monetary policy have been undermined
by Serbia which earlier this year printed money to prop up loss-making
enterprises. Other republics were imposing higher taxes on enterprises to
finance their budgets.
'Under these circumstances, capital investment was cut back and industrial
production was falling. It will fall a further 20 per cent this year,' he
said.
Earnings from tourism, which total Dollars 2bn a year, are likely to plummet
following a spate of ethnic unrest, the virtual collapse of JAT, the
Yugoslav airline, and overpriced hotels and restaurants.
Mr Markovic believes that the present struggle waged by some of the
republics against the federal government is not about whether Yugoslavia
should remain a federation, or a confederation of loose states.
'This comparison is merely a facade. A struggle against the reforms is
taking place. It is a struggle for power - and especially totalitarian
power, which caused a great setback for the reforms. We are now paying for
it.'
Mr Markovic believes the reforms are being hampered, not only by
nationalism, but by the absence of clearly defined property rights.
Last year, he had planned to replace socially-owned property, a nebulous
system devised by the late President Tito which placed property outside the
hands of the state and individuals. 'The basic conflict now is between those
who support and oppose private ownership,' he said.
The republic of Croatia, for instance, wants to transfer socially-owned
property to the state, while the republic of Serbia is against individual
ownership rights.
'The new governments know that if they support private ownership, they will
lose their powers. That is why they want to have property in the hands of
the state,' he said.
Mr Markovic added that 'sooner or later, the republics will have to address
why state property is inefficient. If it was not, then the other countries
in eastern Europe would not be trying to move state property into private
ownership. Without this kind of ownership, we will not be able to develop
democracy.'

FT  16 APR 91 / Soviet scientists work to improve Chernobyl-type reactors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID FISHLOCK, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOVIET UNION will not abandon the type of nuclear reactor that exploded
at Chernobyl five years ago, but is developing the design for a
second-generation reactor of the same type with western safety features,
including reinforced concrete casing.
It is also planning to rebuild the so-called sarcophagus casing assembled in
haste in 1986 to entomb the stricken reactor, according to Soviet nuclear
executives.
The Soviet experts were addressing a joint conference organised by the
Soviet and French nuclear industry in Paris yesterday on lessons learnt from
the accident.
Building of Chernobyl-type reactors was frozen after the disaster, but a new
building programme of second-generation reactors is now being confidently
forecast.
Mr Nikolay Ponomarev-Stepnoy, from the Kurchatov Institute of Nuclear Energy
in Moscow, said that al-though Chernobyl was a terrible accident that shook
the world, 'without nuclear energy we cannot develop our economy.' It had to
be made 100 per cent safe, however.
Only 16 of the 48 of the Chernobyl-type RBMK reactors are currently
operating in the USSR, running at over 90 per cent capacity and generating
48 per cent of Soviet nuclear electricity.
They now embody several safety-related changes agreed with western nuclear
experts after the initial analysis of the accident in 1986.
These measures - which required no reconstruction - include using a more
highly enriched fuel, more safety rods, and faster and more effective
shutdown systems, including one that responds in only three seconds,
reported Prof Eugeny Adamov from the Kurchatov Institute.
They are still trying to unravel precisely what happened in the accident and
have 13 possible scenarios to explain events.
More details of these scenarios are expected to be revealed by the final
report of the International Atomic Energy Agency on the accident and its
consequences next month.
The Soviet nuclear industry is now focusing on two new features for a
second-generation RBMK, says Professor Adamov. It will have a casing to
prevent release of radioactivity in a serious accident, as the containment
did at the US accident at Three Mile Island in 1978. It will also have a
mechanism for venting steam if several pressure tubes should fail, as may
have happened at Chernobyl.
The industry is also focusing on a better quality of staff for nuclear
operations, with a smaller workload, Prof Adamov said.
A special organisation with about 2,000 staff has been recruited to
safeguard the sarcophagus at Chernobyl, reported Dr Alexander Borovoy,
chairman of the Chernobyl Nuclear Institute.
The sarcophagus contains 180 tonnes of nuclear fuel, including over 400
kilograms of plutonium, and was designed to survive for 20 to 30 years and
to withstand hurricanes and earthquakes.
It is now believed that about 15 tonnes of the fuel is present as a fine
radioactive dust which could leak from the sarcophagus.
There is no immediate danger, Dr Borovoy reported, but there are worries
that it may become a danger again within another 7-10 years. The institute
is studying schemes for enhancing its safety, including one that proposes to
fill the entire tomb with concrete to seal it against radiation leaks.
The institute had virtually agreed on a broad programme of research and
development relating to the sarcophagus and hoped that other nuclear
industries would participate, he said.

FT  16 APR 91 / Japan halts Dollars 500m loan to Poland: Tokyo action
displays disapproval of US debt forgiveness policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance is blocking approval of a Dollars 500m loan
promised to Poland, underlining its disapproval with a US-sponsored plan to
forgive at least half of Poland's debts
The money was pledged by Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the Japanese prime minister, on a
visit to eastern Europe last year.
But the Ministry of Finance is blocking approval following an argument with
the US Treasury over a plan to cancel at least 50 per cent of government
loans extended to Poland, and to make similar concessions to Egypt.
A deal was struck last month at the Paris Club of creditor governments in
effect to write off at least half of Poland's debts. Japan - owed Dollars
1.4bn by Poland - agreed extremely reluctantly.
The Japanese finance minister, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, underlined the Japanese
position to an international audience last week. If Japanese government
loans were forgiven, 'then it will become extremely difficult for Japan to
provide new loans to that country,' he said.
Mr Hashimoto met the US Treasury Secretary, Mr Nicholas Brady, on Sunday in
London for a meeting that lasted longer than expected. Mr Hashimoto
described the meeting as a 'friendly argument', although he did not make it
clear what was the cause of the dispute.
The row highlights Japan's growing assertiveness in international financial
affairs. As the world's largest government aid donor, it feels the size of
its contribution earns it the right to influence policymaking. Finance
Ministry officials say that allowing one debtor to write off debts will
encourage others to do the same.
Moreover, Japanese officials argue that the US too used to insist on making
debtors pay. It is Washington which has changed its tune for political
reasons, say Japanese officials. Japan fears other countries will be
favoured for similar non-financial reasons, including Egypt. In the
meantime, far poorer countries in Africa and Latin America are not being
considered for special treatment.
The argument comes at a time when Japan also wants to inject more political
content into its aid policy. Last week, the Japanese government approved a
new overseas development aid policy under which Japan will check on a
country's defence spending and arms exports before extending support. States
with large military establishments or extensive records as arms exporters
could find their aid curtailed.
The policy may not be rigorously applied - Japan has already indicated that
aid to China, a big arms exporter with a big army, will not be affected. But
Japanese intent to secure greater influence in aid policy is unmistakeable.
In the case of Poland, the Finance Ministry official conceded that the prime
minister had made a promise of new loans to Poland. But he said: 'The
situation changed after the Paris Club. I can't say now when the loan will
be made or if it will be made at all.'
Japanese pressure resulted in the inclusion of an option which allowed
creditors to reduce significantly Poland's loan payments, without formally
writing down the principal owed.

FT  15 APR 91 / Uganda pins its hope on an economic revival to help it fight
Aids: The twin problems of a country burdened by a deadly epidemic and an
economy struggling with debt and inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID, a thin young man with an emaciated frame, drawn face and bulging
eyes, walked falteringly towards the car waiting to drive him to a funeral.
David, 23, a former guerrilla who helped bring the present government to
power, is a victim of Aids, or 'Slim' as it is known in Uganda. Thousands
have already died from the disease.
In David's home town of Masaka, south-west of the capital Kampala, and in
nearby villages, more than half the young adults are HIV positive, infected
with the virus that causes Aids.
Nationally, the Uganda Aids Control Programme estimates that more than 1m
people are HIV positive out of a population of about 17m.
The government forecasts that by 2010 more than half the projected
population of some 37m will have died of Aids.
The epidemic is now threatening to undermine the measure of political and
economic stability achieved since President Yoweri Museveni came to power
five years ago.
Mr Museveni assumed the presidency in January 1986 after waging a five-year
guerrilla campaign which brought down the military government which had
itself overthrown the five-year rule of Milton Obote six months previously.
His administration has since been marked by a broad-based appeal for
reconciliation and political stability. But in the past three years, the
main aim has been to rehabilitate the economy. The hope is that an economic
cure may alleviate some of the social problems of poverty and malnutrition
which make parts of Uganda susceptible to diseases such as Aids.
To that end the government has:
Published an investment code aimed at attracting foreign investment;
Reduced inflation from 240 per cent in 1988 to 29 per cent in 1990;
Rebuilt a large part of the once-crumbling trunk road network and
infrastructure;
Improved the provision of essentials, such as sugar and soap;
Enhanced medical services;
Reduced the currency black market by devaluing the Ugandan shilling and
authorised the establishment of bureaux de change.
The World Bank will this year lend around Dollars 200m for reconstruction
projects, having loaned similar amounts in each of the past three years as
part of a structural adjustment programme.
The price of that programme has been tough: it has included frequent
devaluations, increased producer prices to the peasant growers of Uganda's
main export, coffee; the abolition of inefficient state-owned marketing
monopolies (except in cotton); and a concerted effort to cut the budget
deficit.
Having finally published an investment code last November after months of
debate, plans are now afoot to sell off loss-making state-owned companies,
particularly those in better shape, to foreign investors.
Cutting inflation has been one of the government's big successes. The
end-of-year target for 1991 is 15 per cent. With an impressive 6-7 per cent
increase in gross domestic product in each of the past three years, the
World Bank has pronounced the country's economic prospects as 'good to
excellent'.
The economy has suffered, however, from poor world prices for coffee - the
country's main crop and leading foreign exchange earner. Since the 1989
collapse of the International Coffee Agreement, which aimed to support
prices through an export quota system, earnings from coffee exports have
fallen to about Dollars 220m last year, from around Dollars 285m in 1989.
According to the World Bank, Uganda suffered both a 30 per cent shortfall in
foreign exchange earnings last year as a direct result of the ICA collapse,
and the loss of local revenue levied as export tax on coffee exports. This
further weakened the balance of payments, already under pressure because of
the Gulf war-induced higher oil prices.
Lower foreign exchange earnings have also caused difficulties in servicing
the country's Dollars 1.5bn debt.
The reforms have nevertheless begun to attract foreign business interests.
Mr John Dorrell, of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who led a
delegation of British businessmen to Uganda last November said: 'When we
came here in 1987 the country was on its knees; now it is showing signs of
life. It is a market worth Pounds 39.2m (Dollars 69m) to British exporters,
up by 18 per cent on 1989.' Britain is one of Uganda's main trading
partners.
Foreign investor interest has also come from a number of Ugandan Asians, who
formed the backbone of the business community before their mass expulsion by
Idi Amin in 1972. Two once-powerful Ugandan Asian industrial groups, run by
the Madhvani and Mehta families, have already returned to Uganda and between
them now produce some 60,000 tonnes of sugar - enough to meet local needs.
Ugandan-born Mr Nazimu Virani, chairman of UK property-to-pubs group Control
Securities, whose family were among the 60,000-strong Asian community
expelled by Amin, is leading a high-powered delegation of British
businessmen and industrialists to Uganda with the aim of identifying
potential areas of investment.
But Asians' confidence is unlikely to be wholly restored so long as the
government fails to offer compensation for an estimated Pounds 2bn of
property expropriated by Idi Amin following his purge of Asians.
Yet potential foreign investors will need to be convinced that other
problems which threaten stability are being overcome. The army has been
accused by Amnesty International, the human rights body, of killing
civilians, and corruption remains widespread.
For one former soldier, however, the future is bleak. David, the aids
sufferer, stared into the ground and said: 'We fought in the war to stop us
being killed by the army. Now we are all dying of Aids anyway.'

FT  15 APR 91 / Kinnock claims Labour is champion of 'opportunity'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Neil Kinnock yesterday outlined Labour's claim to be the true champion of
an 'opportunity society', accusing the Tories of having cynically dreamed up
the slogan as a general-election winner.
In a wide-ranging BBC Radio 4 interview, the Labour leader said the
government had had 12 years to prove its credentials, but had instead
squandered Pounds 100bn in oil revenues while eroding social services.
Party officials said last night that they had intercepted Tory plans to
entitle the Conservative manifesto document Opportunity Society and would
undermine them with a prior claim to authorship of the concept.
Today Labour's national executive committee will endorse the party's final
pre-election policy document, called Opportunity Britain, from which its
election manifesto will be drawn.
The paper puts heavy emphasis on consumers' rights in goods and services in
the public and private sectors. It stresses the importance of training to
raise employee capabilities and improve Britain's competitive position in
international markets.
Tonight Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, will use a
speech in Brighton to launch an attack on the Tory government's record as an
'enabling' administration, on the eve of the formal publication of Labour's
27,000-word paper.
Challenged in his interview to demonstrate differences between the two
parties' 'opportunity' policies, a relaxed Mr Kinnock said the critical
factor was: 'We mean it and they don't'
He went on to add: 'If there is an idea associated with me in particular it
is the idea of opportunity, of nourishing people's capabilities, of seeing
they are properly cared for by means of the collective resources of the
community.'
By ensuring people are capable of 'growing in stature' they could then make
their own contribution to the community. He cited Labour's new programmes
for training as an example of policies of fostering opportunities.
The Labour leader also highlighted promises to distribute funds for City
Technology Colleges to all schools.
Other new commitments in Labour's document will include a scheme to make
employers provide higher-quality training. The document links educational
and training issues for people aged 16 to 19 with its promise of broader
opportunities, as a key component in boosting UK manufacturing capabilities.
It argues for vocational qualifications to be given equal status to academic
ones, another move aimed at stealing a march on the Tory manifesto.
Labour's other main strategy thrust to be developed this week centres on
promoting its policy for active intervention to help manufacturing industry.
Mr Kinnock was careful yesterday also to emphasise his party's determination
to control public spending.

FT  15 APR 91 / Monday Interview: Visionary with a global goal - Jacques
Attali, president of the EBRD, talks to Peter Norman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The problem with Jacques Attali is knowing whether he has his head in the
clouds or his feet on the ground.
The latest chapter in the remarkable career of this French academic, author,
part-time film-maker, presidential adviser and intellectual begins today
when he becomes president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development.
The London-based EBRD, or European Bank as Mr Attali prefers to call it, has
been set up in record time to help the emerging democracies of eastern and
central Europe develop market economies. It has a lot of hopes riding on it.
Proof of this will be the presence today of some 30 heads of government and
39 finance ministers at the bank's inauguration ceremony in the unlikely
setting of the International Maritime Organisation headquarters on the south
bank of the Thames.
But for Mr Attali, the bank, although important, is only a means to
achieving a much bigger goal. The EBRD 'is the first pan-European
institution, which happens to be a bank,' he says.
Moreover, he would be prepared, if necessary, to postpone its lending
operations for one or two years to ensure that it achieved the right pitch
of excellence. 'I will be very cautious in the disbursements because
triple-A is the beginning and the end of my banking credo.'
This curious mixture of high-flown ambition and operational caution surfaced
many times during an interview with Mr Attali in the bank's spartan
temporary headquarters in the City of London.
Whereas a layman - and some member governments - might suppose that the bank
had been set up to meet specific needs for finance or technical expertise in
eastern Europe, it soon became clear that Mr Attali's main interests lay
elsewhere.
'The question is the vision,' he said. 'The vision was and still is to build
the first pan-European institution, in order to make totally irreversible
the end of the split of the European continent in two.'
This split, Mr Attali explained, went back much further than the 70 years of
communism. For 500 years, in fact, the differences in development between
eastern and western Europe had been a cause of war. As the iron curtain was
falling, he and his former boss, President Francois Mitterrand of France,
had asked themselves how could they 'hook irreversibly the east to the
west'.
The first answer was to create democracy and the market economy in the
former communist states because 'they are the core of success of the western
part of Europe'.
Ideas then focused on a financial institution. 'We could have thought about
a confederation, about political institutions. But today the main problem is
finance.'
The early years of the European Community provided an instructive example.
'The EC was built up not through the ideas of European political union -
although that was useful - but through the first institutions having money.
'We talked about a bank because bank means money. But also because of its
capacity for arm-twisting relationships in order to push them (the eastern
European countries) in the direction of democracy and market economy.'
His ambition is for the bank to help restructure eastern Europe's economy
and then be transformed 'into something else, which is a really purely
global, pan-European institution'. He cites the example of the European Coal
and Steel Community, the forerunner of today's EC, which 'disappeared and
merged into the common market'.
The European Bank will, he insists, be a completely different from existing
international financial institutions (or IFI's) such as the International
Monetary Fund or the multilateral development banks (MDBs) such as the World
Bank. And woe betide anyone who refers to the 39 nations and two European
institutions putting up its Ecu10bn (Pounds 6.9bn) capital as
'shareholders'.
Crunching a plastic pill box in his hand, Mr Attali was adamant: 'This is
not an IFI. This is not an MDB. This is an institution of a third type, of a
new type . . . If you talk about shareholders, you are a commercial bank.
That is fine. But you cannot pretend to have political visions with
shareholders.'
Although Mr Attali dislikes the language of commercial banking, the EBRD's
oper-ations will have a distinct private sector focus. It is committed to
promoting 'private and entrepreneurial initiative' in central and eastern
Europe and can use no more than 40 per cent of its resources to finance the
public sector.
It also has an overt political goal. The former communist states must be
'committed to and applying the principles of multi-party democracy,
pluralism and market economics'.
Its capital has been subscribed by a unique mix of countries, symbolising
the post-cold-war era. European Community states and institutions have a 51
per cent majority of votes. The rest is shared among the other west European
countries, eastern Europe except Albania, the Soviet Union and a few
non-European countries including Japan, Canada and the US, which, with 10
per cent, is the biggest EBRD member. Some 30 per cent of capital will be
paid in and may be used for equity investment.
The bank's treasury department estimates that it could disburse Ecu5.5bn in
loans and make Ecu600m of equity investments in the first five years, rising
to Ecu12.6bn and Ecu1.8bn respectively over eight years.
But aren't these rather small sums, given that Mr Attali last September said
eastern and central Europe would need Ecu2,000bn bring average labour
productivity to French and German levels?
'No, not really, not really,' he replies. 'Suppose it takes 20 years to do
that. Voila] that means 100bn Ecus a year. The bank, according to the people
around here, can mobilise something like 100bn Ecus in seven or eight years:
100bn in seven years means 15bn in one year.'
Because the bank will act as a catalyst, encouraging others to join projects
in eastern Europe, it will activate more investment funds than it actually
disburses. Mr Attali's off-the-cuff projections - which are rather more
optimistic than those of the bank's treasury - suggest it can mobilise at
most 15 per cent of the region's financing needs. But the eastern European
countries have high domestic savings and 15 per cent may be all the foreign
capital needed.
Mr Attali himself will not worry too much if these hopes are not met. 'At
the end of a period we can be there. Even if we say that we are 10 per cent,
I don't care. Even if we say we have half of it, I don't care.'
So when will business start? 'I hope, cross my fingers, that we will have
the first operation done before June.'
It is notable that Mr Attali does not have the bank's business plan at his
fingertips. But then: 'I am an intellectual . . . a professor of economics
first,' he says, 'I will never make the mistake, I hope, to believe that I
could become a banker. I will not take decisions on the banking side. My
only duty is to find the best bankers to do it.'
While moulding the bank, Mr Attali has kept up a fiendish schedule of
extra-mural activity. On the day of the interview he had got up, as usual,
at 4am, to work on his 16th book and to discuss a project for his third
film. In his 10 years as President Mitterrand's special adviser he produced
seven books.
But, contrary to some expectations, he has been very much a hands-on
president-designate. He expects to stay at the bank for more than his
initial four-year term. A strict taskmaster, he has made full use of the
article in the statutes giving him responsibility 'for the organisation,
appointment and dismissal' of staff. There has been a considerable turnover
of personnel at the EBRD so far and this trend can be expected to continue.
Although today will be one of celebration, there is considerable scepticism
surrounding the EBRD and Mr Attali. It is, for example, unclear:
whether it will be able to find enough projects compatible with maintaining
'triple-A' status;
how relations will work out between the 23-strong board of directors
representing the bank members and the bank staff under Mr Attali;
how it will co-operate with the European Commission, IMF, World Bank and
International Finance Corp, which is already active in eastern Europe, and;
whether its political goals will lead to problems in the bank's lending
operations. For example, should the bank call in loans, creating a possible
risk for its business operations, if one of its borrowers reverts to
dictatorship?
On this latter issue, Mr Attali is confident that all international
institutions will eventually fall in with the EBRD's ground-breaking
approach towards encouraging democracy.
He guesses that it will take at least 15 years for eastern Europe to adjust
its economies. 'The only thing is that I am sure we are going to be
disappointed,' he says. 'It will take a lot of time. With a lot of ups and
downs.'
After 55 minutes, it was easy to see how this 47-year-old former eminence
grise of the Elysee Palace can encourage idealism and scepticism in about
equal measure. 'Scepticism is better than (being) despised, isn't it? And
scepticism is not indifference. The worst is indifference,' he says.

FT  15 APR 91 / Justinian: Defence case for taking silk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was more than the ordinary amount of jollity around the Temple this
year over the list of the new Queen's Counsel. Everyone cheered the
appointment of the first black woman at the professionally youthful age of
35. Ethnic minorities and equal opportunists hailed the lord chancellor's
decision as a sensitive response to contemporary social demands. The
profession as a whole found the inclusion of more women in the list and the
establishment of a separate class of honorary QCs (the artificial silks,
such as academics, lawyers, civil servants and solicitors) not unwelcome.
Until now, the Bar has reluctantly accepted social change. It has not, for
example, welcomed - let alone encouraged - women practitioners. Female
barristers were quaintly, if widely, believed to be over-emotional; it was
thought that in order to succeed they had to suppress feminine attitudes. In
a memorandum to the Monopolies Commission in 1969 the Bar Council said: 'The
fact has to be faced that the profession of barrister requires the masculine
approach (however fallacious it may be) to reasoning and argument, and women
only succeed in such activities if they have a masculine disposition.'
Happily, one cannot imagine that being said today.
Given that the gender hurdle has now been successfully negotiated, what
public benefit is there in conferring an accolade each year on approximately
three score and ten advocates? The function of Queen's Counsel is to
maintain a cadre of leading practitioners - roughly 10 per cent of the 6,000
practising barristers - to provide a more expert service than the general
run of barristers can offer.
Queen's Counsel advise or appear as advocates in the bigger or heavier court
cases. They discard the routine work of drawing up pleadings in litigation.
Their paperwork decreases, but their responsibility for the conduct of cases
in the courtroom increases. They are the luminaries of the profession as a
result of proven professional ability and forensic quality.
Queen's Counsel become the chief exponents of legal argument in the high
courts of the land. As such, they attract more readily the tired old myth
that a lawyer's argument is of no value because he is paid to deliver it
(and, as a QC, more highly paid than his stuffed-gown junior colleague). Dr
Johnson had the answer to that quip: unlike testimony, which you might
disregard, he said, argument is argument, and you cannot help paying regard
to arguments if they are good.
Dr Johnson relied on a piece of Baconian imagery. Francis Bacon said:
'Testimony is like an arrow shot from a long bow; the force of it depends on
the strength of the hand that draws it. Argument is like an arrow from a
cross-bow, which has equal force, though shot by a child.'
There is an argument - good enough to demand attention - that 'taking silk'
(becoming a QC) is an anachronism. The quality of professional services
cannot depend upon whether the practitioner is entitled to put QC (or KC in
times of a male sovereign) after his or her name. In fact, the initials may
even deceive the consumer if the lawyer's skills are not up to the standard
implicitly promised by the letters patent. Solicitors who instruct counsel
are, of course, not so readily deceived.
Some of those who apply to the lord chancellor do so less with a view to
practising in the front row of the courtroom than to obtaining a passport
either to judicial office (usually as a circuit judge) or to some other
remunerative occupation outside private legal practice. Successive lord
chancellors have attempted to prevent the system being used this way. They
do not always succeed.
Some new Queen's Counsel do not make the transition sufficiently well to
ensure an adequate income, and fall by the wayside. This is less a problem
now than it was in the past. Until the 1970s, many junior counsels did not
apply to join the ranks of their seniors for fear that their level of
earnings might not be sustained; others felt happier in a less exalted role.
In recent years, however, most barristers have seen the taking of silk as
the pinnacle of a professional career - short of elevation to the bench.
Every year, the number of applications exceeds the number of those who are
awarded their letters patent: roughly one in five are preferred. Only a
handful - the high-flyers in the profession - succeed the first time. Many
have to wait three, four, or even more years before achieving their
ambition. Every year, unsuccessful applications cause much perturbation and
worry. The system has led one or two notable barristers to leave the Bar,
rather than be subjected to the indignity of seeing their peers promoted
while they are left behind.
Is there a case for abolishing the highly-competitive element in the system?
In other Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions which have taken over the system of
having senior counsel, a different and healthier process applies. When a
practitioner at the Bar feels that he or she is ready to take the decisive
step, permission is sought from the leader of the practising profession to
apply to the relevant minister or chief justice (the equivalent of the lord
chancellor). Once that permission is granted, the applicant almost
automatically is made a Queen's Counsel, subject only to a veto held in
reserve for cases of known impropriety. The application is made singly at
any time, thus avoiding the annual race. The distinction is conferred
without the fuss and bother of a ceremony.
The tradition of Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the law - the precise
words of the letters patent - is worth preserving merely as an honour
conferred on successful practitioners within the profession. To give it
greater meaning is to endanger any public benefit associated with the
honour.

<TEXT>
PEPSICO, the US food and beverage conglomerate, said yesterday it plans to
invest Dollars 1.5bn in expansion during 1991 with the bulk of spending
going on its three restaurant chains, writes Our Financial Staff.
PepsiCo, whose 19,500 fast-food outlets make it the world's biggest
restaurant operator, said about Dollars 600m is being earmarked this year to
open new outlets of Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.
PepsiCo said the balance of 1991 capital spending will be divided almost
evenly between the Pepsi-Cola soft drink business and snack foods, in which
Frito-Lay is the biggest subsidiary.
Chairman Mr Wayne Calloway said his company would post 'double-digit' growth
in sales and profits this year.

Debt reduction played a part in one of last week's largest international
mergers and acquisitions, writes Brian Bollen.
Procter &amp; Gamble's agreement to buy the German-based Betrix business from
debt-laden Revlon also continued the consolidation of the international
cosmetics and toiletries industry. P&amp;G chairman and chief executive Edwin
Artzt said the acquisition, part of a US dollars 1.14bn all-cash package
also involving the sale of Max factor and other important brands, is a good
fit with the company's strategic game plan, making it a global player.
US chemicals group Monsanto advanced its restructuring, selling its animal
feed ingredients business to Mitsui and Nippon Soda of Japan. Monsanto said
the disposal would allow it to focus more tightly on its core strengths and
better position it for future growth.
Istituto Mobiliare Italiano continued the expansion of its international
activities with the purchase of a 51 per cent stake in US securities firm
Mabon Nugent. This is the first significant acquisition by an Italian
company in the US financial sector since Banca Commerciale Italiana failed
to buy Irving Trust in 1988.
The purchase of Canada's De Havilland by Alenia (Italy) and Aerospatiale
(France) marks another step in the attempt by European aircraft
manufacturers to reduce their dependence on the Airbus product range.

FT  15 APR 91 / Economic Notebook: Bickering over the Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK is experiencing a behind-the-scenes battle over power-sharing
which is growing in intensity - at a time when the German central bank is
running into ever-greater complications along the road to European Monetary
Union.
Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank president, usually a sovereign figure on
the international monetary circuit, faces a complex assortment of
interlocking problems.
The challenges over a prospective restructuring of the bank's 18-member
policy-making council, necessitated by last year's absorption of East
Germany, are compounding difficulties caused by post-unity financial
turbulence.
Turnaround
Statistics last week showed that Germany ran a small current-account deficit
in the first two months of 1991. This represents a sharp turnaround from
current account surpluses of DM104bn (Pounds 34.8bn) in 1989 (in West
Germany) and DM71bn last year (from July 1, counting both east and west
Germany).
The need to import capital to help cover the costs of unification means that
the Bundesbank will be keeping interest rates high for the foreseeable
future, whatever the desires of partner countries in the European Monetary
System for credit easing.
Concern over German interest rates is overshadowing preparations for the
move to stage two of European Monetary Union at the beginning of 1994, where
France and Germany are still divided over setting up a European central
bank.
Compared with the tussling between Bonn and Paris over EMU, the bickering
within Germany over Mr Pohl's plans to cut down the number of the country's
state (Land) central banks appears almost banal. But the political
ramifications are wide-ranging.
The problem arises because the arrangements under which the Bundesbank
extended the D-Mark to east Germany last year were only provisional in
nature, and need to be sealed by a change in the Bundesbank law by the
autumn.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has to decide in the next few weeks whether or not to
support Mr Pohl's suggestion of reducing the number of Land central banks
from 11 in west Germany to eight in united Germany.
The proposal, involving the closure and merger of some regional central
banks in the west, is politically sensitive because the president of each
Land central bank sits on the Bundesbank's policy-making council.
The Finance Ministry in Bonn is already giving support to Mr Pohl's ideas,
which would slim down the top-heavy council and make decision-making less
onerous. It would also redress the balance between the regional central bank
chiefs and the Frankfurt-based Bundesbank directorate, which garners only
seven votes out of 18 on the council.
The Pohl plan has been backed by a majority of the 18 - but is opposed by a
group of seven Land central banks, which believe the proposal would water
down Germany's federal system and reduce the political influence of
individual states.
Bonn officials say that Mr Kohl, who met Mr Pohl in Bonn last month to
discuss the subject, still has not made up his mind on the issue. This is
partly because the chancellor does not want to annoy the Land governments,
which say they would lose out over the deal.
Mr Pohl's only allies on this question among the Land representatives on his
council are the presidents of the Hamburg, Berlin, Hesse, and Lower Saxony
central banks.
If relations between the Bundesbank and the government were unperturbed, Mr
Kohl's hesitation would not matter much. In fact, they are going through a
stormy time. Mr Pohl upset the chancellor last month by saying in public
that introduction of the D-Mark into east Germany last year had produced a
'disaster'.
Although Mr Pohl sent a letter to Mr Kohl soon afterwards to play down the
remarks, the episode still rankles in Bonn.
Other members of the central bank council believe that a decision by the
chancellor against the central bank president's plan would further undermine
Mr Pohl's authority, which has come sporadically under strain during a
series of disagreements last year over the terms of German monetary union.
Resignation
Mr Pohl was elected for his second eight-year term as the head of the
Bundesbank at the end of 1987, and is due to stay on until the end of 1995.
He briefly considered resignation in February last year, after Mr Kohl
changed his mind overnight and decided, without telling the Bundesbank, to
advocate speedy monetary union with East Germany.
If Mr Pohl were really to resign - although there seem no grounds for this -
the succession would either pass to Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the present
vice-president due to retire in September next year, or to Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, the former Bonn state secretary, who joined the Bundesbank last
year.
A side skirmish in this political tussling took place 10 days ago when the
central bank council, in a highly-unusual move, rejected the new candidate
put forward to join the council from the state government of the Saar.
Mr Hans-Jurgen Koebnick, the mayor of Saarbrucken, was nominated to replace
the incumbent, Mr Hans Gliem. But the Bundesbank council turned him down not
only because they regarded Mr Koebnick as lacking in professional
qualifications, but also because the Saar central bank is due to disappear
under the Pohl plan.
The proposals foresee the state of Hesse taking responsibility for the
Rhineland Palatinate and the Saar, while Hamburg would absorb
Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg and Lower Saxony would merge with
Saxony-Anhalt and Bremen.
A majority on the central bank council made clear that approving Mr Koebnick
would be politically counter-productive and might also be financially
exorbitant, considering the job carries a DM350,000-a-year salary. However,
the Saar will be pressing Mr Koebnick's claims through the Bundesrat, the
upper house of Parliament, which has the final say.
Despite his ministry's basic support for slimming down the Bundesbank's
decision-making apparatus, Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, seems to be
stopping short of giving Mr Pohl full backing.
This may be because Bavaria has sided with the states of Baden-Wurttemberg
and North Rhine-Westphalia in opposing the Pohl plan - and Mr Waigel is
chairman of the Bavarian conservative party, the Christian Social Union.
The political infighting over the new shape of the Bundesbank may seem
highly provincial. But, since it will have a crucial influence over the
future of monetary decision-making, the bickering over the Bundesbank is a
saga worth following for all of Europe.

FT  15 APR 91 / Michelin's man aims to ride out the bumps: The French
tyremaker's tough way ahead in the wake of further job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Francois Michelin, 64-year-old head of the world's largest tyre company, has
been loath over the years to take an axe to his workforce. The decision he
has just taken was thus one of the toughest of his life.
Like everyone in the world tyre industry, Michelin - expected to announce on
Wednesday an annual operating loss of almost FFr2bn (Pounds 198m) plus an
estimated FFr3bn restructuring charge - is suffering from a decline in
prices to its main customer, the troubled car industry. Last week, the
company announced it would shed 4,900 jobs in France - 13 per cent of its
French industrial workforce - in a bid to cut costs. This is the largest of
the five rounds of job cuts Michelin has had to make in eight years.
The move is a catastrophic blow for Clermont Ferrand, the sleepy industrial
sprawl in the heart of the Auvergne, where Michelin has its headquarters and
where one worker in five is an employee of the company. But the only
reaction from the 'Bibs' - as Michelin workers are called locally, after the
company's roly-poly mascot Bibendum - has been resignation; Clermont
Ferrand, which takes almost half the French reduction, is still numb from
the last round of cuts in June when Michelin said it had to lose 2,260 jobs.
The Michelin man himself is in a mood of grim determination, as he showed in
a rare interview last week. His decision is a remarkable change for a
company criticised in the past for being too paternalistic.
Mr Michelin accepts that the company was late in making its job cuts by
comparison with other leading tyre makers. But he points out that Michelin
was only just completing its takeover of Uniroyal Goodrich, the US tyre
group, at the end of 1989 when the downturn began.
He says: 'We were like an aeroplane that is trying to take off. You have to
keep all the engines going until you achieve take-off speed. You cannot
reduce power until you have taken off, otherwise you crash at the end of the
runway.'
The group had for some time suspected it had surplus staff. But until
recently the priority was to grow and become more international in line with
the globalisation of the car industry. Mr Michelin also says the group was
inhibited from making these latest cuts earlier by political, trade union
and humanitarian considerations.
Mr Michelin's direct style is typical of the way that insiders say this
notoriously secretive group is managed; it sets the tone for Michelin's
strategy in tackling the recession.
His office, for example, looks more suitable for a modest works manager than
the head of a 130,000-strong industrial empire. It is furnished with plywood
and steel chairs on a tiled floor - 'putting down plush carpets would be
stealing money from the customers,' says an official - and occupies a corner
of the factory started by his grandfather 101 years ago.
In keeping with this low-key style, Mr Michelin and the two other top men in
the company carry the simple title of gerant or manager. It is a striking
contrast with the typical job title of 'president and managing director'
given to most French company chiefs.
But along with the simplicity comes toughness. Times may be hard, he
indicates, but in no way is Michelin prepared to lose market share. Mr
Michelin estimates that there is 20 per cent overcapacity in the world tyre
industry, equivalent to slightly less than Michelin's own market share. But
these latest job cuts will take out hardly any Michelin capacity and leave
its European production unchanged.
'We are simply adapting our costs to a new economic situation,' he says.
Neither can Mr Michelin exclude further job cuts. That depends on
unforecastable car market trends. 'When will you buy your next car? What
type will it be?' he asks, with one of his frequent enigmatic grins. 'I'd
love to know what will happen in the next four years, but I don't'
Yet tyre industry overcapacity is not the main problem, he argues. The
decline in prices, hastened by recession, is long-term and pre-dates the
industry production surplus. Prices have fallen by 50 per cent in real terms
in France over the past decade, so a tyre now costs much the same as a pair
of shoes or a tank of petrol. 'Given the difference between the technical
risk of a tank of petrol and importance of tyres for the car's safety, that
seems a little unbalanced,' complains Mr Michelin, showing the traditional
French reserve over the usefulness of brute market forces.
He pins the responsibility - though not necessarily the blame - for this on
the car industry. 'The price fall is linked not to overcapacity but to
carmakers' need to reduce their operating costs, and so sell at prices able
to reach a wider clientele . . . Each acts in function of their internal
difficulties and they are perfectly right,' says Mr Michelin. And yet, he
adds: 'I think they are beginning to realise that they can't get away with
everything.'
Some analysts argue that the world tyre industry ought to be powerful enough
to push the car manufacturers around, given that just six tyre groups
control three-quarters of the market. But there is no question of Michelin
breaking ranks and raising its prices. 'Nobody would follow us,' says Mr
Michelin.
Car producers' technical demands are going to become tougher, posing both a
challenge and an opportunity for Michelin, the gerant believes. 'Clients'
needs are going to get very diverse. I see the progressive abandonment of
big series car production, in favour of smaller series. For us, this means
slightly smaller production runs,' Mr Michelin predicts.
In an ideal world, this would be accompanied by a shift from a
commodity-type market to one where prices take more account of quality.
Whatever the difficulties, Mr Michelin is sticking to his strategy. The
Uniroyal Goodrich acquisition was criticised by many as saddling Michelin
with extra production capacity and debt at just the wrong moment. Yet this
was essential to get access to the high margin market for replacement tyres
and for so-called private brands, both specialities of the US company.
Eventually, says Mr Michelin, the Uniroyal purchase will come to be seen as
a sensible move.
Others have criticised Michelin for not diversifying away from tyres apart
from its traditional maps and guides business, which absorbs a tiny fraction
of sales. Until the day the group produces the perfect tyre, Mr Michelin
sees no logic in diversifying.
What about his own future? With his 65th birthday coming up in July, Mr
Michelin says the organisation of a smooth succession 'preoccupies me a
lot,' the first time he has publicly mentioned the possibility.
There is no heir to the throne because the company is run like a
partnership, and the three gerants have the same general management
function. But Mr Michelin points out that the key figure in ensuring
continuity will be the youngest of the gerants, 53-year-old Mr Rene
Zingraff, a lifetime Michelin man, promoted to the post four years ago.
For the foreseeable future, however, there is no sign of this grand old man
of French industry fading into the background or changing his basic
strategy.

<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of right-wing participation in South Africa's proposed
multi-party constitutional talks later this year moved closer yesterday with
the disclosure of a confidential document from the ultra-right Conservative
party which proposes abandoning the party's opposition to talks.
The 48-page document, drawn up at the instigation of Mr Andries Treurnicht,
the leader, warns that the party might become irrelevant unless it joins
negotiations.
Up to now, the party's policy has been to insist on a separate homeland for
whites and to refuse to discuss a post-apartheid, power-sharing constitution
for blacks and whites. Its official policy remains to reject negotiations
but there are signs of a split developing.
The document, published in Johannesburg newspapers, suggests that most white
voters now support the political reforms of President FW de Klerk, and that
he would win a whites-only referendum on a new constitution due to take
place before the end of his term of office in 1994.
It says: 'We have to accept that the days of apartheid are numbered.'
However it does propose that South Africa be divided into 20 regions, some
of which would be separate white homelands.
The timetable for talks remained uncertain, however, as the African National
Congress (ANC) renewed its call to supporters to form self-defence units.
The call came from Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC deputy president, speaking at
a funeral in Alexandra township, near Johannesburg.
Such rhetoric is likely to anger the government but will have little impact
on the peace process, currently held up by the dispute over the recent ANC
ultimatum giving Pretoria until May 9 to take more effective measures
against township violence.
Fighting between ANC supporters and those of the rival Inkatha Freedom Party
broke out last night near Mr Mandela's home in Soweto for the second
successive day. Police estimated that 50 people had been wounded. Police
discovered four bodies in the area earlier yesterday.
European Community foreign ministers are today in Luxwmbourg expected to
endorse the lifting of remaining EC sanctions against South Africa, covering
exports of iron, steel and Krugerrands.

FT  15 APR 91 / Pay-as-you-go roads plan considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S motorists could be made to pay for using congested roads under
proposals being considered by the government.
In the next few weeks, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, will
announce that he is to consider a pay-as-you-go charging system as part of a
fundamental shift in approach to solving Britain's growing traffic problems.
Cars and lorries could be fitted with electronic devices to interact with
roadside monitors, charging according to mileage, time of day and type of
vehicle.
This system, known as road pricing, is regarded by transport economists, the
main opposition parties and a range of other bodies, as offering the most
realistic long-term solution to Britain's growing road congestion problems.
Under Mrs Margaret Thatcher's leadership the government rejected road
pricing as an unnecessary and politically unacceptable infringement of
motorists' freedom.
The re-think, initiated by Mr John Major since he became prime minister, has
opened the way for more sympathetic consideration of the idea.
Mr Rifkind is looking at road pricing as a way of dealing with traffic
volumes, forecast by the Transport Department to rise by between 83 per cent
and 142 per cent by the year 2025.
Mr Rifkind believes the Transport Department's forecasts for traffic growth
cannot be accommodated with road building, and measures have to be
introduced to deter motorists from driving, particularly in urban areas and
the densely-populated south-east.
While increased investment in the railway system could help, Mr Rifkind
considers that British Rail's small share of the passenger travel market -
about 7 per cent of passenger miles - means this can form only part of the
solution.
He has therefore asked departmental officials to study the feasibility of
rationing road space through a pricing system and to suggest ways in which
it could be introduced.
At present, the only country operating a road pricing system is Singapore,
where motorists driving into the city at busy times have to buy permits and
display them on their windscreens.
Other densely populated countries such as the Netherlands are considering
the introduction of electronic road pricing systems, and in the UK Cambridge
is working on plans for a city scheme.
Mr Rifkind's acknowledgement that traffic growth cannot be accommodated by
road building could have wider implications for the Transport Department's
construction programme.
At present, the department's forecasts are used to support its case for new
roads. If it accepts that this growth cannot materialise, its case for some
schemes, particularly environmentally sensitive ones, may be weakened.

FT  15 APR 91 / Code tells directors to act as watchdogs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT, Pensions Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NON-EXECUTIVE directors are to be expected to monitor the activities of
executive directors and, should they consider their performance to be
unsatisfactory, report directly to shareholders.
This role of non-executive directors as the guardians of shareholders'
interests will be set out on Thursday when the Institutional Shareholders
Committee publishes its long-awaited code of practice for directors.
It is expected that the code will also spell out the way in which
non-executive directors will be accountable to shareholders.
The debate over the responsibility of institutional shareholders towards the
companies in which they invest has been spurred by cases of corporate
irresponsibility during the past decade.
The Bank of England, in particular, has urged institutions to take a more
active role in the companies they invest in - especially when things go
wrong or companies act unreasonably - and not just walk away by selling the
shares.
The ISC, composed of investment managers representing pension funds, life
and general insurance companies, unit trusts and investment trusts, has
reacted to this pressure by drawing up a code of good practice on how
companies should be controlled.
The code is expected to state that companies should appoint an adequate
number of non-executive directors, who should be independent of their
executive colleagues. The non-executives should set the renumeration of
executives and, if necessary, should report to shareholders if the
executives are unsatisfactory.
The code is also expected to state that the activities of non-executive
directors will be subject to the scrutiny of shareholders, who will be able
to remove them if they fail to exercise their responsibilities.
It is not known whether the ISC will be prepared to seek amendments to
company law if companies ignore the best practice set out in the code.
Professor Sir James Ball, chairman of Legal &amp; General Group, said at this
year's investment conference of the National Association of Pension Funds
that voluntary action to persuade companies to appoint non-executive
directors had failed and he could see no alternative to legislation.
To complement the directors' code, later this year the ISC will publish its
code of good practice for institutional shareholders.

FT  15 APR 91 / G7 meeting on post-war world economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECTS for the world economy after the Gulf war and the collapse of
communism in eastern Europe were last night assessed in informal talks in
London by finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations.
No substantive statements were made after the discussions which took place
over an informal dinner at 11 Downing Street hosted by Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor.
The UK Treasury said the ministers had 'very good and useful discussions on
a wide range of subjects.'
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said afterwards: 'We have had a
good meeting as always.'
Although the ministers from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain
and Canada left the meeting in good humour, it appeared that several
contentious issues were raised in the discussions.
On entering Number 11, Mr Waigel confirmed that he had come to London intent
on raising the question of 'burden sharing'. This issue of how the big
industrial countries should share the global economic costs of Middle East
reconstruction after the Gulf war and the reconstruction of eastern Europe
has become increasingly controversial in the G7.
Germany believes it is getting insufficient recognition for its efforts to
help eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
There was also evidence yesterday of tension between the US and Japan, which
was believed to reflect US dissatisfaction with Japan's contribution to Gulf
war costs.
Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Japanese finance minister, described a longer than
expected bilateral meeting with Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury
secretary, earlier in the day as 'a friendly argument'.

Having lost a packet on President Reagan's memoirs, top US publisher Simon

by Kitty Kelley's unauthorised biography of Nancy Reagan.
Now, however, the publishing arm of the Paramount entertainment conglomerate
is apparently being made to laugh on the other side of its face by an
embarrassing hoax. It is reported to have paid Dollars 920,000 for a book
about a serial murderer by an unknown writer.
The decision to outbid the rest of the competition for Just Killing Time was
taken after glowing testimonials from John Le Carre and Joseph Wambaugh. The
problem is that neither of those famous authors knows anything about the
book.
Could someone in the US department of dirty tricks be settling a few old

One of the more remarkable things about US money managers is how many of the
go-go investors of the swinging Sixties are still hanging around. Last
week's seizure of Los Angeles-based Executive Life, which has shaken the US
insurance world, has focused attention on one of the great survivors:
60-year-old Fred Carr.
A veteran of the Ira Haupt-salad oil fiasco of the early 1960s, he used to
run the Enterprise Fund which for a while was one of the hottest mutual
funds around. He then moved into the more conservative world of insurance in
the early 1970s. His recent problems stemmed from the fact that he bought
too many junk bonds from the late Drexel Burnham Lambert.
Although no one has heard of Bernie Cornfeld for a long time, several of
Carr's con-
temporaries are still around. Admittedly, Gerry Tsai's star has never shone
as brightly again as it did in the 1960s, but Fred Alger has an
above-average record and Howard Stein, of Dreyfus fund managers, is a pillar
of respectability.

While it may be just Observer's age, good investigative financial
journalists seem thin on the ground these days. Perhaps one reason is that
writing for newspapers is far less lucrative than other things.
Charles Raw, who remorselessly pursued Bernie Cornfeld and Slater Walker
when he was on the staff of The Sunday Times, is hard at work on a book
about Italian financier Roberto Calvi who was found hanging under
Blackfriars Bridge. Meanwhile Christopher Hird, another ex-Sunday Times
insight team man, has just completed a 964-page Who's Who in Industry.
Hird still regards himself as first and foremost an investigative
journalist. These days television is his medium. He has chased David Abell,
Cecil Parkinson, Rupert Murdoch and others across British TV screens, and
has some 'interesting stuff' on ADT's Michael Ashcroft. But the profits from
these one-off TV documentaries can be erratic.
Hence his company Fulcrum, jointly owned with Richard Belfield and employing
40 staff, has had to diversify. An index of nominees and beneficial owners,
known as the red book, has found a niche, and the current listing of 10,000
top people in British industry also looks promising. Priced at Pounds 125,
it's available from
88 Islington High Street,
London N1 8EG.
Showing that his investigative skills are still finely tuned, Hird notes
that under 2 per cent of the entrants are women. The commonest star sign is
Taurus.

Exam-obsessed Britain's long-running debate over whether John Major gained
any O-level passes, has largely overlooked the question of how he might have
benefited if he had. Fortunately, an answer emerged at the British
Psychological Society's conference, which ended yesterday.
It has hitherto been a mystery what passing such exams enables people to do
 -except, of course, for things they are bureaucratically prevented from
doing if they fail: such as higher education.
But UK psychologists Adrian Skinner and Christine
Williams have noted one practical benefit. Heavy drinking has less of a
brain-scrambling effect on boozers with O-levels than on those without.
So it's probably as well that Major downs only the odd one.

Could the next United Nations secretary-general be Prince Sadruddin Aga
Khan, just appointed to co-ordinate all UN humanitarian operations in the
Gulf?
An undeclared but interested candidate, he seemed to suffer a setback when
Finland's Martti Ahtisaari, a senior UN official with similar aspirations,
was named to conduct an on-the-spot assessment of the war's effects on
civilians in Iraq and Kuwait. Prince Sadruddin, already in charge of UN
humanitarian aid, resigned in a huff.
Ahtisaari's emotive report, speaking of the 'near-apocalyptic' results of
allied bombing reducing a formerly prosperous Iraq to the 'pre-industrial
age', did not go down well in Washington and London. President Bush is said
to have proposed personally to current secretary-general Javier Perez de
Cuellar that the 58-year-old French-born prince be restored at the first
opportunity.
A former UN high commissioner for refugees, he has
now been entitled executive delegate. That means he will in effect be the
secretary-general's deputy, standing in for him at all inter-agency meetings
on the Gulf.
He has at least 35 rivals to replace Perez de Cuellar when his term expires
at the year-end, including representatives of African states who believe it
is their turn. But as the veto-holding US and UK have emphasised that the
top UN job is not subject to the rule of equitable geographic distribution,
prospects of an African secretary-general seem slight.

FT  15 APR 91 / Leading Article: Mr Major on trial
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE jury is still out on Mr John Major. Not yet six months into his job, the
new prime minister has yet to demonstrate that he is up to it. This does not
mean the verdict, when it comes, will be adverse. For the evidence is more
in his favour than against. He has revived the fortunes of the Conservative
party simply by not being Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Those who point to the
difficulties facing the Tories today sometimes forget how much more
intractable they seemed half a year ago. A party that was politically
trapped by its own ideology is now busily recapturing the centre-ground,
which is where the next election will be fought.
Not being his predecessor has also helped helped Mr Major to transform
Britain's relations with the European Community. No longer the exasperating
outsider, it is now becoming one of the respected leading players. This is a
testament both to his perception of Britain's true place in the EC and his
diplomatic skills in winning the understanding of President Francois
Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. His proposal a week ago that the EC
should take part in an initiative in promoting a safe haven for the Kurds
may have been rough at the edges, but its general thrust was positively
European. Mr Major was an excellent leader during the Gulf war; if he
appeared at the time to be marching in tune with Washington he has since
shown a canny awareness of the need to maintain Britain's EC position while
yet maintaining the transatlantic link.
Right-wing sniping
Some of the right-wing sniping against him is partly a consequence of this
European vision; some is a consequence of his not being Mrs Thatcher. The
leader of the Young Conservatives and the 22-year-old secretary of the
Bruges Group would not normally attract much attention for their bilious
remarks but they have reflected what some of their elders, who should know
better, have been saying in private. Mrs Thatcher herself has not helped,
particularly if her own reported private remarks in New York, that Mr
Major's government is the 'B-Team", are an indication of her general
attitude.
There are also divisions on domestic policy. Mr Norman Lamont's remarks to
the Adam Smith Institute on Friday night sounded like a warning shot by the
chancellor against the perceived 'wet' inclinations of the party chairman,
Mr Chris Patten. If so it was a needless intervention. Those members of the
government who understand the term 'social market economy' are agreed that
in British conditions it merely means allowing capitalism to create wealth,
some of which is spent on public services.
Seeking consensus
Neither Mr Lamont nor Mr Patten, both of whom understand the term very well,
would advocate an extension to the German interpretation, which involves
seeking consensus between business and the trade unions. There is room for
debate over how much should be spent on health, education and the like. Mr
Major's job is to settle that one.
It is also his job to complete the dismantling of the poll tax, and to show
courage in so doing. The trick has been to win public favour by abandoning
the community charge while maintaining party unity, which requires a
continued element of personal taxation. So far Mr Major has neither united
the party nor won public favour, in spite of cutting the bills to be paid by
transferring the cost to VAT. It is his performance on this, the trickiest
of the challenges, that has caused both friend and foe to call him a
ditherer. The title will stick if he is not soon shown to be decisive.
That said, Mr Major is not devoid of good luck. The recession appears to
have bottomed out. Movements in the German and the US economies favour a
reduction in British interest rates without threatening sterling's position
within the exchange rate mechanism. Economic optimism is returning. True,
the Labour party is in its best shape for 20 years. It presents a formidable
challenge. But the prime minister stands a fair chance of winning the
election on his own policies, in his own way. If he is bold, he will do so.

FT  15 APR 91 / Competing with Germany: A hard act for Britain to follow -
The difficulties of transplanting positive features of Germany's 'social
market economy' to other societies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Leuna works in east Germany offers some instructive messages for foreign
observers wondering how Germany's consensus-based approach to economic and
social management is facing up to the challenge of unification.
Last year it was thought that the vast, outdated complex, near Leipzig,
which marks its 75th anniversary next month, would eventually be dismantled
and closed under the murderous pressure of western competition. Now,
although the original 27,000-strong workforce will be cut by half, the
German government is spending hundreds of millions of D-Marks to keep large
sections of the plant functioning.
President Richard von Weizsacker, who recently toured the Leuna works, last
week hailed 'exemplary' co-operation on the site 'between men and women,
east and west, management and unions'. Mr Wolfgang Schultze, vice-chairman
of the German chemical workers' union IG Chimie, who is deputy chairman of
Leuna's new supervisory board, says boldly that the company's resurrection
will demonstrate the success of the 'German model'.
For Britain, the principles at the heart of the German 'social market
economy' - costly but co-operative relations between both sides of industry
 -represented the antithesis of the policies of Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Under
the leadership of Mr John Major, official British scepticism to the German
system has given way to outright admiration. Last month, in a speech in
Bonn, Mr Major went out of his way to praise Germany's 'social solidarity'
in the organisation of the economy. Although Britain has by no means ditched
Thatcherite belief in enterprise and self-help, the Major government
believes that German-style consensus can improve rather than weaken economic
efficiency.
Britain's change of heart comes at a time when there is increasing pressure
on the German system. Amid rising unease over large-scale unemployment east
of the Elbe, it is still far from clear whether west Germany's 'social
market economy' can put down roots in the former communist-run east. There
are similar difficulties in transferring the 'German model' to the UK. Tied
to Germany through the D-Mark link in the European Monetary System, the UK
now faces the challenge of importing the positive parts of the German
consensus system, while rejecting those elements that are plainly wasteful
or inappropriate.
Wholesale introduction of expensive and bureaucratic German-style consensus
into land unprepared for it, or unable to pay for it, can have disastrous
consequences - as east Germany is finding out. Total west German social
expenditure last year came to roughly one-third of gross national product.
'We are a rich society, and we are willing to pay a certain price for social
peace,' as Mr Karl Otto Pohl, president of the Bundesbank, puts it.
The extent to which methods of running societies can be transferred across
national borders is also questionable. Germany's consensus system is a
product of Germany's own specific history and culture. The traditional
charitable role of the Roman Catholic church, or Bismarck's social
legislation of the 1880s, leaves deep imprints. Industry-wide collective
bargaining between employers and workers' representatives has its roots in
the wage negotiating system set up in 1918 to help bridge social fissures
left by defeat in the First World War.
Strong checks and balances in German decision-making are partly a product of
post-war federalism. Economic power has been deliberately decentralised. One
reason for firm German advocacy of an independent central bank is the memory
of Third Reich totalitarianism, when the Reichsbank was subjugated to Adolf
Hitler. It is uncertain how many German organisational precepts can be
transferred to Britain. In view of Britain's lack of experience in running
an autonomous central bank, if the Bank of England were made independent,
'it could upset the markets", comments Professor Forrest Capie of the City
University Business School.
Another German trait which may prove difficult to export to Britain is
'long-termism' in relationships between companies and banks and other
institutional shareholders. Shareholders' willingness to maintain their
corporate links over long periods, paying less attention to short-term
performance, has its origins in the final decades of the 19th century, when
many of Germany's largest concerns were founded.
Shareholders not only are less demanding in their criteria for return on
investment; German company legislation also gives them fewer rights to check
and control management than their Anglo-Saxon equivalents. One result is
that west Germany is estimated to have only 3.5m individual shareholders (7
per cent of the adult population), against 12m (24 per cent) in Britain.
(The UK figure is considerably boosted by the large number of small and
inactive shareholders who acquired privatisation stocks during the 1980s.)
German business leaders freely proclaim the virtues of the German approach -
especially now that the image of British and US stock markets has been
dented by too many free-wheeling takeovers in the past few years. Similarly,
there is now near-consensus in the UK that lack of 'patient long-term money'
has contributed to Britain's relative industrial lag.
Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of the Deutsche Bank, scathingly describes
as 'financial acrobatics' the tactics of acquisitive UK groups such as
Hanson. He points to the benefits of the bank's long-term relationship with
companies like Daimler Benz, in which it has a 28 per cent stake. 'For some
companies in difficult phases of growth and restructuring, it can be very
useful to have a stable shareholder who accompanies them benevolently
through this phase - and does not complain about the need to maximise
pay-outs or profits every quarter.'
Despite the strength of much of Germany's collegiate management, even
corporate spokesmen like Mr Kopper acknowledge that unduly cosy ties between
German companies and shareholders can reduce market disciplines. In parts of
the economy, 'we need more pep,' Mr Kopper admits.
The large number of areas where British and German structures remain far
apart underlines the difficulties of grafting the German 'model' on to the
British economy. But they also set out an agenda for Britain to learn from
the German experience:
Regional development. German decentralisation has spread economic growth
more equitably. The most prosperous part of Britain - south-east England -
has increased its share of UK gross domestic product over the past 20 years
(from 35.1 per cent to 35.6 per cent) while poorer northern regions have
fallen further behind. By contrast, North-Rhine Westphalia, the German state
with the largest population and the bulk of German industry, has fallen
during this period (from 28.5 to 26.2 per cent) - and formerly lagging
regions like Bavaria and Rhineland Palatinate have come to the fore.
Education. In contrast to comprehensive schooling dominating British
education, the principle of 'streaming' prevails in most of Germany,
reflected in the numerous types of secondary schools. Whereas during the
1980s the majority of British children left full-time education at the age
of 16, about 55 per cent of 16- to 18-year-olds in Germany remain in school.
Labour relations. German industry-wide trade unionism and 'co-determination'
 -representation of trade unions on supervisory boards - remain powerful
factors dampening labour flare-ups. The number of registered trade union
members has risen slightly in west Germany in recent years to 9.5m at the
latest count, whereas the total in Britain has slumped to 10.2m.
During 1987 to 1989, for every 1,000 employees, west Germany lost an average
three days per year in labour disputes - compared with 169 per year in
Britain. The German strike pattern could nevertheless deteriorate as a
result of worsening economic difficulties in east Germany.
Vocational training. The German 'dual system' - where young people undergo
in-company training combined with technical and general courses at outside
colleges - is one part of the 'model' which Britain is already trying
actively to imitate. There are about 15m trained German workers, three times
the figure in Britain.
There were 65,000 apprentices in British manufacturing industry last year,
together with 41,300 other trainees. The number of apprentices in German
manufacturing, by contrast, is about 610,000.
Housing finance. In the UK, financial deregulation and incentives for home
ownership spurred an unparalleled surge of bank lending for mortgages in the
1980s. This was one factor behind the 1983-88 credit-driven boom - and the
inflation at the end of the 1980s. British commercial banks' real estate
lending rose from 12 per cent of total loans in 1980 to 23 per cent in 1989,
with housing loans up from 4 per cent of the total to 12 per cent. There has
been no such diversion of resources into property in Germany.
About 65 per cent of UK homes are owner-occupied (compared with 50 per cent
in 1971), whereas the proportion in Germany is only 40 per cent. Even though
Germany is suffering from a severe housing shortage, banks' real estate
lending remained steady as a proportion of their overall loans during the
1980s.
Technology. According to Mr John Dryden, head of the scientific, technical
and industrial statistics division at the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD): 'There is a realisation in Germany that
the right kind of infrastructure for innovation and technical progress has
to be put into place. And this is concentrated in the sectors where the
rewards are likely to come.' West Germany's annual research and development
spending came to between 2.8 and 2.9 per cent of GNP towards the end of the
1980s, compared with 2.3 per cent in the UK.
Mr Heinz Riesenhuber, the German technology minister, says he misses not
having a British opposite number. The famed German cultural bias towards the
engineer may be a reality. This is nevertheless not borne out by the
biographies of some of the countries' captains of industry.
Only two of the chairmen of Germany's top companies measured by turnover
have a scientific education (one as a chemist, the other as an engineer),
whereas four are lawyers. In the UK, three of the top 10 chairmen have a
scientific or technical background - and only one studied law.

FT  15 APR 91 / Arts: Oslo Philharmonic - Barbican Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten years ago it would have been unthinkable that the Oslo Philharmonic
should have featured in a 'Great Orchestras of the World' series and, what
is more, promised to be one of the most exciting attractions. So quickly can
an orchestra's standing rise under inspired leadership.
On its present tour the orchestra is directed, as before, by the
Lithuanian-born Mariss Jansons.
Like Szell in Cleveland or Dorati in so many cities, Jansons has proved to
be a tireless orchestral trainer, set on raising his players to the highest
standards of ensemble.
The orchestra has become his ship, bound to follow where its Principal
Conductor, with all his personal enthusiasms, his strengths and weaknesses,
pilots it.
At their Barbican concert on Saturday the course was set for the
19th-century German romantics, Brahms and Wagner, not really home waters for
this conductor and an area from which he has largely stayed away on record.
It is also worth remembering that the Oslo orchestra is not naturally
endowed with the glorious sound of great orchestras like Berlin or Vienna.
What they have achieved with Jansons is the result of hard grind.
Typically there was nothing lazy about their performance of Brahms's Second
Symphony, which opened the concert. Accents were weightily despatched; notes
were conscientiously held for their full length.
Neeme Jarvi, a neighbour in spirit perhaps, as he is Estonian, has given us
this kind of Brahms before, with its emphasis on a thick and glutinous
texture, as though the music asks for rich paste lyricism, no matter how
sticky the going may become.
The trouble is that Jansons's nature is the opposite. He always wants to be
dynamic, as one could see briefly when the third movement trio flashed past
with Tchaikovsky-like brilliance.
However, for too much of the time in this symphony he seemed to be doing
what he thought was right, rather than letting his inhibitions go, as usual.
The Wagner, the Prelude and Liebestod from Tristan, went much better, some
overheating at the climaxes apart.
Then the programme ended with a showpiece account of the favourite second
suite from Ravel's Daphnis et Chloe.
No excess of Gallic sensibility here. The sunlight at daybreak glared with
the forceand brilliance of the brass.
The rhythms of the bacchanal pounded with red-blooded animal excitement.
This was Jansons unrestrained and the Oslo players supported him splendidly.

FT  15 APR 91 / Arts: There is no 'frozen music' here - Birmingham's new
Convention Centre disappoints Colin Amery / Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sounds of a solitary harp filled the empty hall - glancing, plangent
notes almost other worldly in their purity. It was a moment of musical
truth. The first of many days of trials and testing moments for the new
Birmingham Symphony Hall where the first public concert will be held
tonight. I leave it to my much more musical colleagues to judge the success
of the acoustics of this hall; my concern is with the what the eye beholds.
Was it Goethe who described architecture as 'frozen music'? Whoever it was
would have found it difficult to decide which score lies behind the
architecture of present day Birmingham.
There is no doubt about the city's wish to try to undo much of the terrible
damage inflicted upon the centre of Birmingham by the road engineers,
architects and planners of the 1960s. The focus of its civic plans is the
new Centenary Square which has grown out of a townscape study of the Broad
Street area between Paradise Circus and Fiveways. It is here that you will
find the new Convention Centre, Symphony Hall, and hotel and here you can
witness the brave efforts to establish a new kind of civic place.
What you see today, writ terrifyingly large, is the complete failure to
design any new civic buildings of real architectural quality. The new
Convention Centre is without the serious virtues of proportion, elegance or
beauty. Compare it with the planned new civic buildings of Barcelona or
Paris and Birmingham's efforts take it down to the level of the new
Bucharest. It is a tragic tale because the city's intentions are brave and
intelligent. The idea of a great series of halls for international
gatherings and an acoustically promising new concert hall for a major city
orchestra must be applauded. The blame for the unsatisfactory nature of the
new buildings lies squarely with the architects.
They have failed on a number of counts. No visible attempt has been made to
relate the volumes of the halls to the public circulation spaces. The
asymmetry of the bulging glass wall of the entrance facade and the crude
projecting bright blue steelwork are ominous external signs of what is to
come inside. It must have seemed a good idea to have an internal 'street'
allowing the public to wander through the entire building to reach the canal
and the now postponed commercial development; but the atmosphere in this
street is horribly similar to the interior of Heathrow's terminal four.
Massively over-engineered visible structure and ducts hover beneath the
glass roof; you expect all that structure to be supporting something
enormous, but it is just grotesquely over-scaled. The steep staircases
create awkward angular spaces which are often rather desperately filled with
plants.
There was a limited architectural selection process back in 1984 when the
Percy Thomas Partnership and Renton Howard Wood Levin Partnership were
selected. They then collaborated as the Convention Centre Partnership. Other
architects considered and rejected included Richard Rogers and Skidmore
Owings and Merrill. The architects' brief was to design 11 halls including a
2,200 seat concert hall and a 1,500 seat conference auditorium. Their
townscape study sensibly suggested the lowering of the main traffic route of
Queensway and the creation of a pedestrian link from the city centre to the
new square. Flexibility was the watchword of the brief - which can often
mean that the client does not really know what he wants. In this case almost
all the halls can be used for various uses and so they are all extensively,
and expensively, equipped for almost everything.
The local authority decided to adopt the 'per cent for art' plan for the
Convention Centre, and it is the artists who have provided most of the
redeeming features of the scheme. The brick patterned pavement of Centenary
Square and its ironwork has all been beautifully designed by Tess Jaray.
Seen from above it is like a wonderful carpet, and I liked the heavy weight
of the railings and lamp standards. An entertaining fountain by Tom Lomax
sits merrily in the square, and there is a huge figurative sculpture to come
from the artist Raymond Mason.
Inside the foyer area of the concert hall the artist Deanna Petherbridge has
been commissioned to paint a large ziggurat-shaped mural on the foyer side
of the curved rear walls of the concert hall. This 'architectural fantasy'
in oil paint has been skilfully designed to fill the walls on four levels.
On each level the actual space is relatively low and the artist's intention
is to create a whole composition that will be seen, particularly when lit at
night, from the square outside. This curved space leads into the bars and
tragically there are horrible blue troughs of plants, with chrome stands and
tops to take glasses, to separate the drinkers from the non drinkers. This
is apparently the wish of the licensing authority - bureaucracy comes before
art. These ghastly erections will effectively obscure the mural and I can
quite understand why the artist is disinclined to finish her magnum opus if
it is to be rendered scarcely visible.
The interior of the concert hall is what most people will probably enjoy.
Its form owes a great deal to the acoustical model designed by Russell
Johnson of Artec Consultants Incorporated (New York). The shoebox form of
the hall and the tiers of balconies are a great contrast to many of the
fan-shaped wide auditoria that have been built recently.
The thick walls, resonating chambers, and a moveable canopy over the
orchestra will make the hall capable of an unusual mixture of clarity and
warmth of sound. The finishes are hard - polished wood and waxed plaster
with a glitter of chrome and polished granite. The decorative ideas behind
the relentless horizontal lines and the jazzy motifs of doors and columns
seem to come straight from the days of the deco cinema. There is a Wurlitzer
quality to the room - not relieved by the unattractively asymmetrical design
of the organ case and pipes.
It is awful to be so disappointed by the sheer lack of architectural
distinction in this major public building. An extraordinary opportunity in
Birmingham has produced an unoriginal, styleless and deeply ordinary
solution.

FT  15 APR 91 / Arts: Days of Hope - Hampstead Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although I doubt whether Howard Goodall's new musical will make it to the
top, it is worth going to see if only to ponder on that narrow line between
success and near miss. It is not that the subject matter is wrong, though it
is slightly peculiar and nowadays in danger of seeming out-dated.
Days of Hope revolves round a young Englishman who goes to Spain to fight
for the anti-Franco forces during the Spanish civil war, and takes his bride
and part of her family back to his home town of Scarborough when Franco is
victorious. Apart from a brief prologue, all the action takes place in
Spain. The significance of Scarborough is that it used to be a regular base
for the Labour Party conference. I rather liked the juxtaposition. It is
not, on the face of it, a more unpromising subject for a musical than, say,
post-Peron Argentina.
The difficulties lie elsewhere. A good musical is unmistakeably a musical,
not just a play with songs. Days of Hope falls between stools.
Half of it is a rather straight play, wandering between the melodramatic and
the corny, written by Renata Allen. The other half includes some very good
numbers, but the dialogue seldom leads naturally into the singing.
Part of the fault in the Hampstead production may stem from the direction by
John Retallack of the Oxford Stage Company.
The Hampstead Theatre has a small stage, but not so small as to dictate that
practically every time a musical number begins the participants have to get
into a horizontal line. Retallack could learn something about deployment of
resources by looking at the versatility of some of the productions at the
Gate Theatre in Notting Hill, which has an even smaller stage.
Having his characters stand in line only emphasises the somewhat stilted
nature of the piece.
The small size of the place detracts in another way. The orchestra consists
only of a piano and two guitars, shoved off at the side. It is interesting
to reflect how a try-out production of Evita would have looked in such
circumstances. For the most striking point about Days of Hope is that some
of the music and lyrics, both written by Goodall, are pretty good. It is not
inconceivable that, given better staging and a fuller instrumental back-up,
they would rank alongside those of established successes.
Take Viva la Muerte, for example, which is a powerful revolutionary song. So
are some of the others, including the one which gives its title to the
musical. They have catchy tunes and not bad lyrics. As we know from the rain
on the plain, there are plenty of words to rhyme with Spain.
Somewhere there is a better musical lurking to get out than the one in the
Hampstead production.
Even with its imperfections, I could think of worse ways to spend an evening
in the theatre.

Once again the most interesting group of programmes is on Channel 4 as part
of the 'Banned' season. The second in the documentary series The Truth About

everything from Stalin's agricultural policies to McCarthyism, from the
Katyn Forest Massacre to Tiananmen Square.
Damned In the USA (10.30) is a 'Without Walls' special exploring freedom of
expression in America which is statutorily protected by the constitution.
But moralistic pressure groups persuade corporations to cease funding
programmes which they dislike. Freaks (11.50) is a 1932 Hollywood movie
intended to 'out-horror Frankenstein'. It tells of sideshow freaks taking
revenge on a female trapeze artist. Not shown in Britain for 30 years, it is
a curiosity rather than a great film.
Horizon investigates prehistoric man on the north American continent (8.10

FT  15 APR 91 / Arts: Ann Murray - Wigmore Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are few songs as difficult to sing as Schubert's deceptively simple
'Nacht und Traume'.
The technical difficulty of keeping the piece in tune, let alone sustaining
the proper feeling of rapturous calm, means that it is one of the least
frequently heard of the composer's favourite songs, not often encountered in
live recitals and certainly not at the beginning of the evening.
Yet that is where Ann Murray placed it to start her recital on Friday.
She opened the evening with a quite exemplary piece of singing. This voice,
which is pushing up into the reaches of the soprano territory, can sometimes
sound uncomfortably stretched if it is asked to provide large-scale singing
beyond what nature may have intended for it; but the basic quality of its
simple and pure mezzo beauty has never been lost.
The Schubert group, sung without undue artfulness or exaggeration, made a
promising start. 'Der Zwerg', of which Miss Murray gives such a telling
performance in her contribution to Hyperion's complete Schubert song series
on disc, also showed that she is well able to use music to create an
atmosphere, with a palpable sense of impending danger at the start.
By and large, though, it is not the dramatic or intense songs that she does
best. Berlioz's 'Elegie en prose' sounded not so much exalted at its climax
as stressful, the voice hard pressed and losing something of its quality.
'Der Soldat' and 'Der Spielmann', two of an attractive group of Schumann's
Hans Christian Andersen settings, were thoughtfully narrated, but without
the ability to get the crux of the story to hit home.
Simple is best with this singer. Strauss's three Ophelia songs, so often
since Schwarzkopf the occasion for neurotic over-emoting, were twice as
effective in Murray's restrained performances, the half-crazed
eccentricities of the music delightfully touched in both by the singer and
Graham Johnson, as imaginative as ever at the piano. The final song, Samuel
Barber's 'Nuvoletta', was a marvel of wistful understatement.
What a good idea, too, to give us first Berlioz's songs from Irlande and
then Barber's settings of James Joyce: an ideal programme for the most
successful of today's Irish singers.

FT  15 APR 91 / Arts: Brahms piano trios - Royal Festival Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brahms wrote five altogether, but two include a horn or clarinet. The other
three employ the canonical violin and cello, and they add up to a solid
programme, not least because they range so widely over the composer's career
 -in fact the early B major Trio of 1854, op 8, was extensively re-composed
some years after the far later Second and Third Trios had been published. To
deliver the programme, who better than Vladimir Ashkenazy, Itzhak Perlman
and Lynn Harrell? - all distinguished Brahms players, and keen collaborators
as well as notable concert soloists. On Saturday, however, the Festival Hall
seemed the wrong place for them.
The hall was crowded; but human bodies soak up sound. Though one can hardly
speak of 'the' Festival Hall acoustics, because they depend upon
concert-by-concert adjustments to a great many concealed amplifiers, I can
say that on Saturday the acoustics granted to the Ashkenazy team were dry
and severely distancing. One wished the whole affair transplanted to the
Wigmore Hall.
In the op 87 Trio at the start, the strings' bald unison declamation - a
device much used by piano-trio composers for forceful effect - seemed frail
and remote. Then the piano-entry, which should be a rich revelation of the
harmonic context, seemed just as wan. It was understandable that the
ever-tactful Ashkenazy should choose to keep his piano lid half-closed -
Perlman's violin is invincibly sweet, not aggressive, and Harrell's forte is
introspective, quasi-vocal musing - but it didn't flatter Brahms's robustly
impassioned piano-parts.
The pianist allowed himself a few ringing outbursts - much of a muchness,
actually, in whichever Trio - at sound, unarguable places. Otherwise he was
content to supply sympathetic accompaniment to the strings well in front of
him, who looked deeply into each other's eyes and played like a committed
duo. The net effect was of performances excellently prepared en gros et en
detail but probably much-recycled and by now polished to routine. At least
there were properly fiery moments in the heroic C minor Trio, op 101; and in
the B major work, which was their anti-chronological conclusion, there was
enough imagination in the rapt Adagio and the Finale to let us conjecture
how they might have sounded close-up.
Must this repertoire go the way of the new maxi-audience operatic ventures -
with similar musical losses? Why should subtle musicians find themselves
delivering serious, narrow-gauge Brahms to a huge audience in the wrong kind
of place? The gilt-embossed front cover of the programme-book said it all:
'celebrity chamber recital' (italics mine) - in the Festival Hall] If there
are big concert halls that can offer friendly accommodation to chamber
music, this one is not among them, except when performers have a Russian
knack for enlarging chamber-gestures to an operatic scale. From a distance,
I admired these performances sincerely; but I have heard much more exciting
accounts of each Trio by less famous virtuosi - in halls of the right size.

FT  15 APR 91 / Construction Contracts: Contracts worth Pounds 3.7m won by
Don Reynolds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DON REYNOLDS, the curtain walling subsidiary of Henry Barrett Group, has
been awarded contracts worth about Pounds 3.7m. The four contracts, two in
Scotland, one in Northern Ireland and one in England, will use Series 200,
400 and 500 of the curtain waIling systems.
A four-storey extension plus refurbishment to the Amerada Hess building in
Aberdeen will be carried out by Don Reynolds. It will be the Hess
Corporation's new European headquarters. The project is worth about Pounds
1.2m and the main contractor is Miller Construction, also from Edinburgh.
The curtain wallers will build a four-storey office block for Scottish
Nuclear Fuels' headquarters in East Kilbride. The main contractor is the GA
Group and the project value is about Pounds 1.1m.
After the IRA firebombing on January 5 of Sprucefields Shopping Centre in
Lisburn, Northern Ireland, Don Reynolds will rebuild the single-storey

FT  15 APR 91 / Management: Nuclear Electric - Facing a deadline of megawatt
proportions / The challenge of introducing a commercial ethos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High on any list of companies ripe for a turnround would be Nuclear
Electric, the state-owned operator of 12 nuclear power stations in England
and Wales.
Morale in the industry is at rock-bottom, following the UK government's
decision in late 1989 not to privatise the nuclear stations. Public
confidence in nuclear power is, if possible, even lower. Not only has the
industry been contaminated by the fall-out from nuclear disasters like that
at Chernobyl; its claims that power was cheap were also shown to be
misleading during the privatisation process.
Yet Nuclear Electric, created just a year ago and with its first corporate
plan newly landed on ministers' desks, has only until 1994 to get its act
together. That is when the government has promised to review the future of
nuclear power. At stake is the question of whether any new stations should
be built after Sizewell, the only nuclear station now under construction in
Britain.
The man with one of the most difficult management tasks in Britain is John
Collier, Nuclear Electric's 56-year old chairman. A life-long nuclear
engineer and proud author of the standard textbook on 'convective boiling
and condensation', Collier is turning his mind to the messier arts of
cost-cutting, team-building and politics.
For the first time in its 35-year life, nuclear power in Britain has
powerful commercial competitors. Nuclear Power is in direct competition with
National Power and PowerGen, the newly privatised fossil fuel generators,
for any growth in electricity demand which emerges in the 1990s.
It is scarcely surprising, therefore, that the policies adopted by Nuclear
Electric to sharpen up its commercial performance resemble those favoured by
National Power and PowerGen in the run-up to privatisation. Central to these
is the new designation of Nuclear Electric's power stations as profit
centres.
This more commercial ethos is being overseen by Mike Kirwan who left
consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte last year to become Nuclear
Electric's finance director, and is one of a raft of private sector managers
imported into the finance and commercial functions. 'We want to transmit the
profit motive downwards to managers in charge of the power stations, which
in the past would have been regarded as cost centres, but now are profit
centres,' says Kirwan.
The operational heart of this programme is a new system of internal markets,
described by Kirwan as 'a pretty fundamental change in the way we run the
business'. In future, Nuclear Electric's departments which provide an array
of costly technological services for the power stations will have to bid for
the business. Station managers will be free to accept an internal bid or to
look outside for cheaper services.
Coupled with a new system of performance-related pay for managers, Nuclear
Electric views internal tendering as crucial to improving its efficiency.
Committed to an 'aggressive headcount reduction', Nuclear Electric's senior
managers admit privately that staffing in the old Central Electricity
Generating Board was 'gold-plated'.
Last year, staff costs amounted to Pounds 305m, a sixth of the total. John
Collier has announced a target of scything 2,500 out of its workforce of
14,000 by 1994. Other measures in Nuclear Electric's corporate plan to boost
profits include:
Improving AGR performance. The five stations which use advanced gas-cooled
reactors, a design unique to the UK, have been notoriously poor performers.
Even last year, when they recorded their best ever performance, they
produced less than 23 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity against a
theoretical maximum of 40TWh.
Higher output from the AGRs would not be matched by a corresponding increase
in costs, so increasing their production is fundamental to Nuclear
Electric's short-term prospects. John Collier, who says the AGRs are
overcoming their fuel-handling problems, holds out the prospect of the AGRs
producing 30TWh within three years.
Collier says Hartlepool and Heysham 1, two of the less efficient AGRs, are
'coming good'. He is less sanguine about Dungeness B, which has typically
performed at less than 20 per cent of potential. 'If in two to three years'
time, it is still failing to generate significant amounts of power, we will
have to look at its continuation very seriously.'
Extending the life of Magnox stations. The seven stations which use Magnox
reactors, the oldest commercial reactor in the world, present a different
problem. There is little scope for squeezing more output from these
workhorses, but Nuclear Electric wants to extend their lives, since all
their capital costs are sunk. Collier says the marginal cost of electricity
from the Magnoxes is less than 1.5p a unit (kilowatt/hour), way below the
costs of competing fuels.
Nuclear Electric has put three options for extending the Magnoxes to the
Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, the safety watchdogs. Under the most
ambitious, the lifetime of the stations would be extended to between 33 and
37 years. The inspectorate's permission will be needed to keep the stations
open beyond 25 years.
Cheaper decommissioning and waste management. Nuclear Electric now backs a
novel decommissioning route which does not involve dismantling old nuclear
stations.
Instead, the reactor building would be sealed in concrete and left under
observation for about 135 years. After that, the site would be mounded over
and could be opened to the public as a picnic spot. Whether the public will
feel happy frolicking on top of an old nuclear reactor remains to be seen,
but the attractions for Nuclear Electric are clear; it reckons it would
shave more than Pounds 1bn off the Pounds 3.5bn discounted cost of
decommissioning its nuclear stations.
In parallel, Nuclear Electric is in the middle of long-running negotiations
with British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), the state-owned nuclear waste operator,
about cutting the cost of waste reprocessing. Nuclear Electric wants to
replace the current regime of cost-plus contracts with a new fixed-price
system. Since BNFL's charges account for a quarter to a third of Nuclear
Electric's costs, the potential savings are again substantial.
Taken together, this strategy is designed to double operating profits after
eight years, a more aggressive target than that agreed with the government
when Nuclear Electric was formally created last year.
At the time, Nuclear Electric committed itself to achieving broadly the same
operating profits after eight years as last year, namely Pounds 225m.
Improvements in performance were planned to match the decline in income from
its government-backed subsidy - a levy on all electricity bills. Senior
executives recognise, however, that even the new target will not be enough
to deliver a return on capital which would rank as satisfactory in the
private sector.
Put another way, even if Nuclear Electric succeeds in all its aims, its
power will still cost much more than that from new stations burning gas, the
fuel of choice in the rest of the industry. Comparing the cost of
electricity from different sources is notoriously open to manipulation. But
even Nuclear Electric quotes the unit price from Sizewell on completion in
1994 as 5.2p, compared with 2.9p from a new gas-fired station.
'The economics (of nuclear power) in the long term will be compelling. The
problem is how to get through a rather difficult four to five years,'
Collier says.
The industry is pinning much of its hopes on public concern about global
warming. For once, nuclear power is squeaky clean on an environmental issue;
Industry executives believe that global warming will force governments to
boost the price of fossil fuels through carbon taxes, thereby improving
nuclear power's competitiveness.
Meanwhile, Nuclear Electric is preparing for the promised 1994 review.
Demonstrating that it can complete Sizewell to time and cost will be
crucial.
But more important still will be the outcome of the next general election.
Conservative ministers have all but prejudged the review by stressing their
strong support for nuclear power; the Labour party is much more iffy.

TEAM WORKING, rather than assembly lines, can offer substantial benefits to
clothing manufacturers seeking to supply shorter runs and respond more
quickly to requirements, according to a report from the National Economic
Development Office.
The report studies six companies using team working in the UK, US and
Germany. It investigates issues such as ideal team sizes and whether
part-time workers are suitable.
Team working, sometimes called modular manufacturing, is when a group of
workers carries out interchangeable work, for which there may be a general
bonus. Three large British garment manufacturers - Coats Viyella, Courtaulds
and Bairdwear - have team working in some operations.
The report identifies several drawbacks with assembly line work on the new
shorter runs. Take-home pay fluctuated because workers had to learn new
styles. That could lead to workers' seeking alternative employment. Also
evidence was growing that machinists who mainly performed a single operation
were likely to be particularly susceptible to repetitive strain injuries.

FT  15 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Ford union leaders fear further job
cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION LEADERS at Ford, the US-owned vehicle manufacturer, have been called
to a meeting with Ford's head of manufacturing in Europe this month, raising
fears of further job losses at the company's plant in Halewood, Merseyside.
Ford said yesterday that it had no immediate plans for cutting jobs in
Britain beyond the reduction of 980 jobs among its manual workforce of
31,000 announced earlier this year.
The company said it also had no plans to close either its Halewood plant or
its plant in Dagenham, Essex - which employs 12,000 workers - and it
required output from both to maintain European capacity.
Mr Jimmy Airlie and Mr Jack Adams, the secretary and chairman of Ford unions
in Britain, have been asked to meet Mr Albert Caspers, Ford's European
vice-president for manufacturing operations, on April 25 and they expect to
discuss Halewood's future.
Although productivity has been raised at Halewood and Dagenham in the past
two years, the unions are worried about the long-term future of both plants.
Unions welcomed Ford's announcement this month of a Pounds 12.9m investment
in Dagenham as a sign of the company's long-term commitment to the plant.
However, it has implemented short-time working at Halewood because of a drop
in demand for Escort cars.
Redundancies at Ford are likely to form the background to pay negotiations
later this year at the end of a two-year pay deal reached in 1989. Pay talks
at Ford traditionally act as a benchmark for pay in the car industry and in
manufacturing generally.
Because the second half of the 1989 two-year deal guaranteed workers a rise
of 2.5 per cent above inflation, Ford employees received a 13.4 per cent
rise last November. The fall in demand for cars in Europe may make Ford less
generous this year.

FT  15 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): EC may act over work noise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT may face action in the European Court of Justice over the way
in which it has implemented European Community laws on the control of noise
at work.
A directive provides for workers in specific industries to be given periodic
hearing tests. However, the European Commission fears there may be delays
and difficulties in providing the tests under the National Health Service.
The Commission has written to the government saying that UK legislation does
not adequately reflect the intention of the directive.
The government is considering its response but it is likely that the
commission will press ahead with formal proceedings, which could culminate
at the European Court in Luxembourg.
The conflict has implications for other EC health and safety directives that
will have to be incorporated into UK legislation over the next year or two.
Regulations relating to the use of visual display units, for example, might
prompt similar difficulties.
Employers might become responsible for providing eye and hearing tests for
some workers.
The noise regulations came into force at the beginning of last year and are
designed to protect workers from damage to hearing. The number of
occupational deafness claims by workers has soared in recent years and
companies such as Ford have had to pay millions of pounds in compensation.
The Health and Safety Commission, the body that drew up the UK regulations,
said it was satisfied that it had done what was necessary to implement the
directive. It said: 'Workers, like anyone else, can approach their general
practitioners if they're worried about health problems.'
A number of trade unions, led by the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers' Union,
have alleged since the UK regulations were introduced that inadequate
provision had been made for hearing tests.

FT  15 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Union row over N Sea pay deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DISPUTE between leaders of unofficial industrial action in the North Sea
and official unions broke out publicly yesterday as union leaders said they
were prepared to sign a pay and conditions deal that would fall short of the
terms they originally demanded.
Leaders of the Amalgamated Engineering Union responded sharply to criticism
of union tactics from the leaders of unofficial action. Mr Gavin Laird, AEU
general secretary, said the criticism was 'singularly unfortunate' and would
inhibit union recruitment.
In spite of efforts to get most of the 20,000 contract workers to register
with unions in order to hold a ballot on industrial action, AEU leaders said
only 7,000 had registered. That meant the ballot would have to be postponed
indefinitely.
Talks between unions representing contract construction workers and leaders
of offshore contracting companies are due early this week. Among those
taking part will be Mr Jimmy Airlie, AEU executive councillor, and Mr Tom
McLean, the construction section national secretary. Mr Airlie said he would
be prepared to sign a deal providing conditions were met.
That would mean unions would re-enter an agreement covering work on 'hook
up', or the construction of rigs, which they abandoned two years ago because
employers would not extend union recognition to the 'post-hook-up' phase of
rig maintenance.
They would accept instead a model set of terms and conditions from the
Offshore Contractors Council in return for undertakings including an end to
the alleged blacklisting of 460 workers who took part in industrial action,
and the right to recruit workers offshore.
That stance has been strongly criticised by the Offshore Industry Liaison
Committee because the unions have accepted that they will not be able to
obtain a broad continental-shelf deal covering all North Sea workers.
Leaders of unofficial action are this week expected to announce that they
may form a non-TUC union covering oil and gas workers.
Mr Airlie said that a continental-shelf agreement remained a long-term aim
of unions but they had to accept that they were not yet strongly organised
enough to achieve it.
The AEU leaders were speaking at the start of the Scottish Trades Union
Congress in Dundee yesterday.

FT  15 APR 91 / Reed ponders dilution of stake in BSkyB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REED International, one of the main shareholders in British Sky
Broadcasting, may decide not to put new money into the venture and to accept
dilution of its stake of roughly 10 per cent.
No final decisions have been taken but Mr Peter Davis, chairman and chief
executive of Reed, yesterday declined to confirm or deny reports that the
international publishing company might not participate in plans to raise up
to Pounds 200m for the satellite TV venture.
Reed's share of the fund raising for the consortium created in November by
the merger of British Satellite Broadcasting and Mr Rupert Murdoch's Sky
Television would be between Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m.
Mr Frank Barlow, chief operating officer of Pearson, which holds roughly 10
per cent of BSkyB, said yesterday that if Reed decided not to take part in
the new round he was confident that the money would be raised by the other
original BSB shareholders. (Pearson is the publisher of the Financial
Times.)
The main BSB shareholders other than Reed that would be responsible for
raising half the new money are Pearson, Granada and Chargeurs. Mr Murdoch
has said he will put up his half of the Pounds 200m in a mixture of cash and
value such as film rights.
The industry would be surprised if Reed decided not to go ahead. Mr Davis
was important in setting up the negotiations that led to the merger of BSB
and Sky, and Mr Ian Irvine, deputy chief executive of Reed, is also chairman
of BSkyB. The apparent doubts at Reed come when the other shareholders are
more optimistic about the medium-term prospects for what is virtually a
monopoly.

<TEXT>
THE RECESSION in the financial services sector appears to be coming to an
end, according to the latest quarterly survey of the sector by the
Confederation of British Industry and leading accountancy firm Coopers &amp;
Lybrand Deloitte.
However, the survey also forecasts that firms are likely to continue making
substantial cuts in employment even after those made over the past three
months.
The report highlights the fall in business volumes in the sector since last
summer and says it accelerated during the three months to March. Activity by
private individuals is sharply down, and financial institutions and
industrial and commercial customers have also cut activity.
However it is expected that, overall, business volumes will stop falling
over the next three months, with building societies in particular expecting
a strong revival in business from private individuals, to offset an expected
continued decline in activity within banks, finance houses and general
insurance companies.
Profitability in the sector declined sharply over the past three months,
resulting in widespread job cuts, particularly by banks.
The decline in profitability is expected to slow considerably over the next
three months as business picks up and costs come under tighter control.
Nevertheless, the survey shows that staffing cuts are expected to continue
at a slightly higher rate over the next three months as firms strive to
reduce the proportion of total costs accounted for by staff.

FT  15 APR 91 / Recession forecast to end in fourth quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM MCCALLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK economy will begin a weak recovery from its present deep recession in
the second half of this year, according to a group of forecasters using the
Treasury's computer model of the economy.
The Ernst &amp; Young Item Club forecasts that lower interest rates will have
given a strong enough boost to business and consumer confidence by the
middle of this year to stop the economy contracting.
The recovery in the second half will be weak, it says, although slightly
stronger than Treasury predictions. However, by the end of 1991 output will
only be back to just above its 1990 level, itself barely above 1989's.
In the first half of this year, gross domestic product is expected to fall
by more than 3 per cent from the same period last year, making the recession
nearly as deep as that of 1980-81.
Item expects a further 0.2 per cent decline in output in the second half of
this year and a 1.7 per cent fall for the year. By the fourth quarter, the
economy will be growing by 0.2 per cent on the year.
Although lower interest rates will improve corporate cash flow, the sharp
fall in inflation will reduce companies' ability to boost margins by raising
prices, which will further hold back growth, according to Item.
Item expects the corporate sector to cut its financial deficit by Pounds 6bn
this year to Pounds 21bn by way of a 12 per cent reduction in investment and
by shedding labour. That will allow industry to cut its interest payments
from the Pounds 23bn reached in 1990 but 'will mean continuing famine for
the capital goods industry and a slow crawl out of recession'.
Item expects inflation to fall to 4.1 per cent by the end of this year,
while unemployment rises to 2.19m and to 2.57m in 1992.
In 1992, output is expected to grow by 2.2 per cent. If oil output is taken
out, the economy is expected to grow by 1.3 per cent, compared with the
Treasury's estimate of 2.75 per cent.

FT  15 APR 91 / Index-linked certificates lead National Savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEX-linked National Savings Certificates were the best-selling National
Savings product in 1990-91, with net buying by the public of Pounds 1.18bn
in the certificates.
That investment was by far the largest contributor to National Savings, with
a positive investment of Pounds 1.4bn (a contribution to public-sector
borrowing) in the financial year 1990-91, compared with a net disinvestment
( ) of Pounds 1.68bn in 1989-90.
The recent public appeal of the certificates reflects high levels of
inflation. At the same time, the public was disenchanted with fixed-interest
National Savings certificates last year, with a net sale of Pounds 1.22bn.
Income Bonds and the National Savings Investment Account, both popular with
non-taxpayers because income is paid gross, also did well, with net
investment of Pounds 785.7m and Pounds 632.5m respectively. Capital Bonds,
with net investment of only Pounds 204.1m in 1990-91, have still not become
popular since their launch a couple of years ago even though they pay
benefits gross.

FT  15 APR 91 / Rolls-Royce discusses Thai joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine maker, is in discussions to expand its capacity
in the Far East which may include a joint venture in Thailand to make
components for its products and supply the local market.
Senior officials of the company, including Sir Ralph Robins, the chief
executive, held talks in Thailand, Indonesia and Japan on a visit that ended
last Monday.
'We held initial talks in Thailand about the local manufacture of components
for our range of aerospace products,' Rolls-Royce confirmed yesterday. 'We
are interested in gaining new sources of manufacturing . . . But we are at a
very early stage of discussions.'
The company is still closely associated with the British engineering
industry, a legacy of its days as part of the group that also made
Rolls-Royce cars.
While a large percentage of the company's components is manufactured in
Britain, a significant proportion is sourced overseas, including some
high-technology elements such as turbine blades. Rolls-Royce has
joint-venture arrangements with companies in Australia, Spain, and Italy.
The Rolls-Royce executives also discussed possible future orders in Japan
and plans for engine production at the Indonesian plant during their visit.

FT  15 APR 91 / Threat to finance for exhibition centre expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS to attract private capital to help finance a Pounds 115m
expansion of the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham are on the verge
of failure.
Birmingham City Council, the owner of what is the UK's largest purpose-built
facility for trade fairs, will seek to persuade the Department of the
Environment to relax financing restraints to enable the expansion to take
place.
Previous expansions have been financed by council-guaranteed borrowings.
Whitehall's refusal to allow a similar course for an extension of the trade
fair facilities from the existing 125,000 sq metres to 155,000 sq metres led
to the search for private capital.
The management company of the National Exhibition Centre has been talking
with an unnamed group of trade exhibition organisers and building
contractors for almost a year over terms for a joint venture on the planned
new extension.
The talks have reached the stage where the private-sector companies either
have to accept what is on offer or reject it. A final meeting between the
management company and the private-sector companies will take place within a
month, said Mr Terence Golding, NEC chief executive.
It is clear that the terms for private-sector involvement are not acceptable
to the companies. 'This is not the right climate to plan a long-term
investment, a property-based investment,' Mr Golding said. 'We never thought
it would be easy to persuade the private sector to invest in the NEC - there
are too many other investment vehicles.'
The council will attempt to persuade the Department of the Environment to
approve an alternative means of funding the expansion or enable loans to be
raised pending a disposal of part of the asset to the private sector when
the economy recovers.
The city council will argue that because the NEC is a UK, rather than a
local, asset the constraints on local-authority borrowing should be lifted.
The council will emphasise that since the early 1980s the NEC has not only
serviced its loans but has also made a contribution to the city's general
rate fund. It will argue that constraints on local-authority borrowing are
selectively applied. For example, Manchester airport's second terminal will
be financed with council loans.

FT  15 APR 91 / Publishing directors quit in row over premises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE managing and editorial directors of Mitchell Beazley, the specialist
publisher, have resigned in a row with its parent company Octopus Books,
part of Reed International.
The resignation of Mr Duncan Baird, managing director, and Mr Jack
Tressidor, editorial director, came after the parent company had insisted
that Mitchell Beazley should give up its separate premises and move into the
Octopus headquarters in London.
Mitchell Beazley was one of the leading niche publishers of the 1970s and
1980s, famous for its Hugh Johnson books on wine and The Joy of Sex.
Mrs Janice Mitchell, widow of Mr James Mitchell, a co-founder, is expected
to resign as a non-executive director.
When Mrs Mitchell sold the publishing company to Paul Hamlyn's Octopus four
years ago - just before it in turn was taken over by Reed - undertakings
were given on both autonomy and an independent location.
When Mitchell Beazley moves to Octopus headquarters in Michelin House,
Fulham, redundancies are feared in areas such as sales which could be served
centrally.
Mitchell Beazley is believed to be profitable, with pre-tax earnings of
about Pounds 900,000 on a turnover of Pounds 10m.
It is not clear whether the top-level resignations will endanger
relationships between the publisher and its authors.
Redundancies and cost-cutting have been widespread among British publishers,
an industry that has been affected seriously by the recession.

FT  15 APR 91 / Government backs Liverpool council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIVERPOOL City Council's moderate Labour leadership has won government
support to fight the unions, which plan a series of strikes from Wednesday
against 1,000 scheduled redundancies among the city's 29,247 employees.
After secret talks, the government is understood to have tacitly approved a
strategy of increasing the city's debt if it becomes necessary, on the
ground that if the Labour moderates cannot make Liverpool more governable,
no one else can.
The councillors' stand has been publicly endorsed by Mr Michael Heseltine,
environment secretary.
'The more Liverpool people are seen to be taking proper steps and running
their authority correctly and with proper financial management, the greater
confidence there will be in the city,' he said on a visit to Liverpool last
week. 'The council is absolutely right to be determined to be seen as one
which runs its budget properly and sets an appropriate lead.'
The unions have called a three-day all-out strike from Wednesday. Council
leaders believe the unions will later impose a levy on the majority to pay
for long-term strikes by workers in sensitive areas such as revenue
collection.
The city's capital debts, already at Pounds 780m, are 48 per cent higher
than the average for metropolitan boroughs. Borrowing to bridge revenue
shortfalls caused by striking accounts clerks is likely to create a
current-account budget deficit and precipitate more sackings.
Labour has 67 seats on the 99-seat council, and a recent purge of
left-wingers by the party's national executive is expected to lead to an
increase in the moderates' representation from 33 to about 40 in the local
government elections on May 2.
Even so, council leaders and senior officers are concerned that the chaos
some union leaders want to bring about, coupled with Liverpool council's
reputation, may deter financial institutions from lending more money when Mr
Phil Kelly, the treasurer, turns to the City to negotiate.
They are therefore emphasising that the fight is vital if Liverpool is ever
to be run efficiently or fairly.
Mrs Vicki Roberts, who chairs the council's finance and strategy committee,
said the council was operating below government recommended staffing levels
in social and welfare services because manual unions were forcing
overstaffing in building and maintenance departments.
A survey by the Liverpool Daily Post showed that Liverpool had 65.6 council
workers per 1,000 population, compared with 58.6 in Manchester, a city of
comparable size, 40.1 in Birmingham and 39.6 in Leeds.
Management of the city was severely criticised this year by the district
auditor, the government's watchdog on town hall spending. A letter to all
the councillors said that the prevailing culture was to provide jobs rather
than services and that overstaffing had to be reduced.
Ron Todd, transport workers' general secretary, yesterday offered the
council a 'partnership' to deal with 'the downward spiral in Liverpool of
recurring financial crisis and poor service delivery'. He was speaking in
Dundee, where the Scottish TUC begins its annual conference today.
After Labour's purge of Militant Tendency activists in the mid 1980s, the
organisation's power base shifted into town hall trade unions, from which
supporters cannot be expelled.

FT  15 APR 91 / Greens tighten campaign belt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Green party has launched its local-election campaign on a shoestring
budget to promote policies for giving people direct control over councils.
Their preparation for the May elections comes amid recognition by members
that the party faces a financial crisis. The spring conference in
Bridlington yesterday passed an emergency motion giving national officers
powers to cut spending in order to reverse a deficit of Pounds 7,500. Such
an amount is small by other parties' standards but abhorrent to a party
without guarantors, with a falling membership and which rejects spending
beyond its means.
An emotional debate included an offer to resign by Mr Ron Bailey, national
campaigns co ordinator, and accusations of past profligacy. The conference
increased membership fees by nearly a third but then agreed to reconsider
cuts to campaign budgets.
Some 1,400 candidates, a tenth of the party membership, will fight council
seats, largely relying on local campaigning. Nationally, the party has set
aside Pounds 10,000. A party political broadcast for next week has been made
at a cost of Pounds 2,000.
Green themes make no concession to the other parties' preoccupation with
local taxation. The Greens' alternative is to allow councils to choose from
a series of alternative tax schemes. They also want to give voters the right
to change councils' agendas and challenge regulations. So far, 200
candidates have agreed to stand on a 'recall' basis - agreeing to recontest
their seat at any time if 20 per cent of voters demand a re-run.
Party officials reject accusations that their proposals are a recipe for
chaos. 'Not consulting and making decisions quickly can actually take longer
in the long run - look at the poll tax,' said Mr Mallen Baker, party
co-chair.
The 22-strong Green party council was given power by the conference to cut,
if necessary, the paperwork sent to all members as part of a constitutional
obligation to give all members equal say in decision-making. At the weekend,
across-the-board cuts were agreed in the party's budget.
Members were unanimous in describing the party's predicament as one of
crisis proportions, although one, Miss Penny Kemp, of Maidstone, was forced
to withdraw her claim that 'the party is bust'.
Amid acrimonious debate, there were signs that the dedicated Green activists
were relishing their immersion in the Greens' particular style of politics.
Mr Andrew Simms, another party speaker, told members proudly: 'I am a
convener of a committee of one which has agreed to a cut in its budget to
zero. Just shows how consensual we can be.'

FT  15 APR 91 / EC drug advert rule angers industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ELISABETH TACEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK DRUG manufacturers are launching a campaign against advertising rules
proposed in a draft directive from the European Community.
Information carried on the packaging of non-prescription medicines would
have to be given in television, newspaper and radio advertisements,
according to a code proposed this month by the EC environment, public health
and consumer protection committee.
The draft directive has also come under fire from the Association of the
British Pharmaceutical Industry, the trade body for prescription medicine
manufacturers, because the EC proposes to ban all 'giving and receiving of
gifts, pecuniary advantages and payments-in-kind' between the drug industry
and practitioners. The association says that the proposed ban threatens to
block sponsorship of conferences within the industry.
The directive says that all usage instructions, side effects or adverse
reactions, precautions, interactions with other substances and any special
recommendations must be given not less than a quarter of an advertisement's
space or air time, according to Ms Gopa Mitra of the Proprietary Association
of Great Britain, representing non-prescription medicine makers.
The association carried out a survey in 1990 which showed that when two
television advertisements for a cold remedy and a pain killer carried all
the label information, fewer viewers remembered what the drugs were for than
when another advertisement was shown with the simple message 'Always read
the label'.
Prescription medicines can be advertised only to the medical profession.
Mr Ben Hayes of the ABPI said the association's code of practice allows
'gifts as promotional aids that are inexpensive and relevant to the
practitioner'.
The system has caused controversy, with allegations of inducements being
made to doctors to prescribe a company's drugs or to take part in drug
trials.

<TEXT>
TEAMS fighting Kuwait's oil fires yesterday dismissed as impractical a
government claim that the task could be accomplished in seven months, amid
signs of growing tension between the firefighters and the Kuwait
authorities.
Mr Rasheed al Almeeri, the Kuwait oil minister, said at the weekend the
government had decided to invite companies from across the world to help
fight the fires under a 'new strategy' to cap all the wells in seven months.
However, Mr Mike Miller, president of Safety Boss, the Canadian blow-out
company, said yesterday the task would take two to three years, however many
companies became involved. 'Some of the bigger wells will take several weeks
each to douse, if not a few months,' he said.
The government announcement followed offers from European and other oil and
construction companies to sell Kuwait their equipment and technical aid to
help solve the problem. Representatives from Agip, Petrofina and Elf
Acquitaine are in Kuwait this week to meet ministers.
Mr al Almeeri said the government was negotiating with companies from
Britain, China, France, Germany and Iran.
Mr al Almeeri's decision to bring in more contractors was made without
consulting the four US and Canadian companies so far taken on. 'It will be a
surprise to them,' he said. 'Perhaps it will make them work faster.'
However, leaders of the four companies bridle at the suggestion that the
slow progress - only three fires have been put out so far - is their fault.
'We still haven't been able to get the equipment into the country,' said Mr
Brian Krause of Red Adair Co. 'I'd guess we have about 20 per cent of what
we need to do the job.'
The companies say the larger fires cannot be tackled until the arrival of
several more 85,000 pound earthmovers - now being flown into Kuwait airport
 -and until water can be either piped or trucked to wellheads in quantities
of up to 1m gallons a day.
Iraq will soon be producing sufficient oil products to meet its needs, the
Iraqi news agency said yesterday.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush at the weekend defended his administration against
criticism of failing to support Kurdish rebels and sought to refocus public
attention on his vision of a world united against aggression and injustice.
In the first of four speeches to define the 'new world order' at Maxwell Air
Force base War College, he promised to provide 'food, shelter and safety' to
Iraqi refugees and condemned Iraq's President Saddam Hussein for a
'savagery' which would make Iraq 'a pariah nation'.
Internal conflicts have raged in Iraq for years, he said. 'I do not want one
single soldier or airman shoved into a civil war in Iraq.'
This speech followed days of Democratic criticism during which the
administration has appeared inept and confused about its post-war policy.
The New Republic magazine, in an editorial entitled Desert Shame, said: 'Can
it really be that the big global order Americans went to war for is designed
to protect only the kingdoms of emirs, regardless of the consequences to
millions of people?'
Meanwhile, the television reports which once generated enthusiasm for the
war have been focusing on the ordeal of the refugees. The president's
stunning popularity, although still high, has begun to ebb.
Mr Bush cast the war as the 'first real test' of the new world order. Its
four tenets would be: peaceful settlement of disputes, solidarity against
aggression, reduced and controlled arsenals, and just treatment of all
people.
He noted that the Warsaw Pact had disbanded earlier this month but that
Americans would remain in Europe in support of Nato.
'America's commitment is the best guarantee of a secure Europe, and a secure
Europe is vital to American interests and vital to world peace.'
He said reforms must continue in the Soviet Union if it is to share in 'the
new opportunities.'
He will meet leaders of Soviet republics and 'all elements active in Soviet
political life' as well as the central government in Moscow.

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the Christian Democrats, the main centre-right group in the
European Parliament, have agreed to a cautious political convergence with
British Conservative MEPs.
In Brussels on Saturday party chiefs of the Christian Democrat European
People's Party (EPP) welcomed the request by Tory MEPs to join the EPP in
Strasbourg as 'allied members'.
They agreed to set up 'a consultation committee' with the Tory MEPs to
thrash out agreement on such thorny issues as monetary union and EC social
policy, with a view to the European Democratic Group (composed of 32 British
and two Danish conservatives) joining the EPP in one year in a 'federation
of groups' in Strasbourg. EPP leaders said they hoped that this would lead
the British conservatives - at a national, not just European parliament,
level - 'even closer' to them by the Euro-elections in 1994.
This tentative response to the Tory MEPs, who have been banging on the EPP's
door since losing heavily to Labour in the 1989 Euro-election, was a
compromise. Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose friendship with Prime
Minister John Major has led him to champion UK admission, expressed
satisfaction.
Spanish, Portuguese, Greek and Luxembourg leaders also backed early Tory
integration. But this was strongly opposed by the Dutch and Belgians, with
the Italians hesitant. The reason for the antipathy of Low Countries'
Christian Democrats to the Tories is not only that they are frequently in
ruling coalition with socialists, as at present: they also have large
affiliated trade unions, which dislike Tory opposition to the EC Social
Charter.
Prime Minister Wilfried Martens, the Belgian prime minister who is the EPP
president, none the less paid tribute to Mr Major for his 'very open
attitude' to negotiations on political and monetary union.

<TEXT>
PRESSURE is building on President Mikhail Gorbachev to agree to a coalition
government after renewed appeals by two key republican leaders for such a
compromise and the unveiling of central government anti-crisis measures
which cannot be implemented without republican support.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian federation leader, urged President Gorbachev
at the weekend to hold 'round table' talks with all political forces to stop
the country disintegrating, as a crippling strike by coal miners demanding
the Soviet leader's resignation threatened to spread to other sectors of the
economy.
'Sitting at this round table should be Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and other
representatives of the republics, of the Communist and other parties and
movements, and of strikers, including the miners. Does this question need to
be resolved somehow? Yes it does, otherwise that will be it. The country
will disintegrate,' Mr Yeltsin said before leaving for a visit to France.
Meanwhile party officials quoted by the official news agency Tass yesterday
sought to quash rumours that the Communist party was seeking to oust Mr
Gorbachev.
President Nursultan Nazarbayev, of Kazakhstan, who has tried to bring Mr
Yeltsin and Mr Gorbachev together, said he feared it was already too late
for them to reach agreement. But he echoed Mr Yeltsin's call for a coalition
government, saying that the country was in danger of succumbing 'to a more
brutal dictatorship than the old totalitarian system'.
Mr Nazarbayev was speaking in an interview published the day after Mr
Valentin Pavlov, Soviet Prime Minister, submitted to deputies an anti-crisis
programme which relies on co-operation with the republics. 'We need a
government of national confidence which will have a clear programme and its
own think-tank, and which will offer urgent measures for resolving the
crisis,' the Kazakh leader told Komsomolskaya Pravda.
Official statistics published at the weekend said coal output fell 82 per
cent in March following the start of the miners' strike. Non-ferrous metals
production was down 7 per cent in the first quarter, while other sectors
showed a fall in production ranging from 6 per cent in machine tools to 15
per cent in timber.
Meanwhile, the republic of Georgia sought to boost its campaign for
independence when its parliament yesterday elected Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia,
the parliamentary chairman, as its state president, in a preliminary step to
calling direct presidential elections next month.
Transport in and through the republic has been paralysed because of a
three-day strike by rail workers demanding Soviet troops withdraw from South
Ossetia.

FT  15 APR 91 / Soviet anti-crisis plan skirts controversy: Important
concessions are now being made to the republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOVIET government's proposed revised anti-crisis programme, aimed at
halting 'economic chaos and collapse', comes against the grim backdrop of a
12 per cent fall in national income for the first quarter of this year.
In a significant concession to the increasingly independence-minded
republics, the programme, distributed to deputies ahead of a full debate
next Monday, makes no mention of a need to sign the proposed Union Treaty,
merely suggesting republics sign agreements securing a unified economic
policy and a single market.
The programme makes key concessions to the republics. It offers to withdraw
recent central government restrictions on exports as well as swingeing taxes
on foreign currency earnings of Soviet enterprises. It limits central
government responsibilities foreseen by initial drafts of the Union Treaty,
but requires in return that republican leaders ban strikes for a year and
share a common financial and social policy, as well as responsibility for
paying off the country's foreign debt.
The programme envisages radical measures to attract foreign investment,
including concessions to foreigners (to be agreed with republics over the
next two months), and legislation, to be presented by June 1, allowing
repatriation of profits in hard currency. In a move of particular
significance to the former Comecon countries, hit by the switch from rouble
to dollar trading, it also relaxes a ban on foreign barter deals. It will
allow barter deals which bring essential foodstuffs and consumer goods into
the country, and allows a resumption of payments to eastern Europe on a
clearing basis and in national currencies.
By stressing the need for foreign investment and enhanced co-operation with
international organisations such as the IMF, the text also retreats from
earlier xenophobic comments by Mr Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet prime
minister.
It is proposed in the programme to stabilise the rouble by moving to
internal convertibility of the currency and expanding the domestic hard
currency market while banning foreign currency deals between enterprises. It
intends to support the ailing Soviet currency through tough fiscal policy
and raising the supply of goods, partly by selling off housing, plant and
equipment.
The anti-crisis programme, however, skirts around controversial areas which
helped account for last year's rejection by conservatives of the radical
500-Day economic reform Programme. It makes no mention for instance of
breaking up collective farms and rapidly rationalising and privatising heavy
industry proposed in the plan drawn up by economists under Professor
Stanislav Shatalin.
Without explicitly endorsing private land ownership, it does, however,
encourage republics to continue the privatisation of agriculture (Russia and
other republics have already adopted legislation allowing the sale of land
to peasants). In an attempt to avoid a repeat of last year's problems in
collecting the harvest, it also provides for the use of of troops to
collect, process, and transport this year's crops.
The programme provides for the privatisation of small businesses with
emphasis on food trade and services, saying two-thirds of such enterprises
should be out of state hands by the end of 1992. But it sets no targets for
privatisation of big and medium-sized enterprises, saying this should be
pursued jointly by the centre and the republics.
At the same time, it provides for an emergency regime of centralised food
and grain distribution, and the maintenance of centrally-planned contracts
for industrial enterprises for a one-year-period.
This means that small businesses will be hard pressed to get hold of goods
to sell in a privatised retail network.
While the programme provides for achieving the liberalisation of most prices
by October 1992, by gradually eliminating administrative controls, it is not
clear how the government will cope with hyper-inflationary pressures.

FT  15 APR 91 / European bank aims to start lending by June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development hopes to begin lending
to the former communist countries of eastern and central Europe before June
this year, according to Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president-designate.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Attali said the first
operations would probably take the form of co-financing with other
international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank and the International Finance Corporation.
Speaking before today's inauguration of the London-based bank, Mr Attali
emphasised that the organisation would be cautious in building its loan
portfolio.
It is likely that the bank will also focus on providing western technical
assistance for creating market-based economies. Mr Attali will this week
seek additional 'special funds' from some of the 39 nations and two European
Community bodies setting up the bank to finance technical assistance and
training in addition to the bank's normal lending and investment activities.
Mr Attali wants the bank to become a centre of expertise and influence as
well as a promoter of democracy in the former communist countries.
The bank will have a capital of Ecu 10bn (Pounds 6.9bn), of which 30 per
cent will be paid in and available for equity investment in eastern and
central Europe.
The bank's treasury department has estimated that it could commit itself to
lending Ecu 5.5bn and make equity investments of Ecu 600m in its first five
years of operation. This would rise to Ecu 12.6bn and Ecu 1.8bn respectively
over its first eight years.
The expectation is that lenders would be encouraged by these commitments and
other investors are expected to join projects supported by the bank. The
bank's treasury estimates that its efforts could mobilise between Dollars
42bn (Pounds 23bn) and Dollars 50bn of loans and equity for eastern and
central Europe in five years and between Dollars 100bn and Dollars 120bn in
eight years.

FT  15 APR 91 / Experts tackle oil threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLLUTION experts were last night working to avert a possible ecological
disaster in the Mediterranean after the sinking of an oil tanker off the
Italian coast at the weekend.
One slick is already threatening a 10-mile stretch of Italy's most popular
holiday coastline and the government has declared a national state of
emergency.
The Haven, the 109,000-deadweight-ton tanker which sank yesterday in the Bay
of Genoa after catching fire on Thursday, is a sister ship of the Amoco
Cadiz. The Amoco caused one of the world's worst oil pollution incidents
when it ran aground off France in 1978, spilling 1.6m barrels of oil on to
the Brittany coast.
A task force comprising the Italian Navy, merchant marine and environmental
officials was examining the feasibility of containing what appeared earlier
at the weekend to be an escalating catastrophe.
However, Mr Tosh Miller, of the International Tanker Owners' Pollution
Federation, was optimistic last night that damage could be limited. Flights
over the spillages indicated yesterday morning that less than 5,000 tonnes
of oil had escaped, he said.
Greenpeace, the environmental group, had suggested that some 25,000 to
30,000 tonnes of oil might have leaked from the vessel.
Ms Luisa Pierantonelli, a director of the Rome command centre set up by the
Italian environment ministry to handle the crisis, estimated that 434,000
barrels of oil were still on board. She speculated that as much as 90 per
cent could have burned off. Other environment ministry officials said the
thick consistency of Iranian heavy crude would help limit the damage.
Two large explosions, one on Saturday and one early yesterday, had rocked
the listing Haven, which caught fire four days ago after an explosion in
which two crewmen died and three remain missing.
The Italian Navy towed the ship 11 miles into shallow water where it sank to
a depth of 68 metres about a mile offshore, leading to hopes that some of
its 1,035,000 barrels of Continued on Page 16
Iranian crude - nearly four times the oil that spilt from the Exxon Valdez
off Alaska in March 1989 - could be pre-vented from discharging.
The ship has 56 compartments, and it is not clear how many have been
ruptured. Italian officials said oil was no longer leaking after the
sinking.
Troodos Shipping and Trading, the London agent acting for the Haven's
Cypriot owners, said the Smit Rotterdam salvage tug had been chartered to
assist in an effort to pump the remaining oil out of the submerged tanker.
Most of the pollution control work is centred on a seven-mile long and
two-mile wide slick which was yesterday about four miles off the Italian
Riviera, between Savona and Varraze. Locals fear the consequences of a break
in the weather which has been settled for the past three days.
Some small oil deposits have been washed up on the beach at Varraze but most
of the slick has been contained by booms, many of which were installed by
specialists from the Oil Spill Service Centre in Southampton who flew out
last week. The centre, run by the large oil companies, is also equipped for
mechanical skimmers used to scoop floating oil from the surface.
French local authorities in Cannes, Nice and St. Tropez were on a state of
alert over the weekend, while ecologists warned that the current could carry
traces of oil to the French shore from Wednesday.
The 17-year-old Haven, formerly called the Amoco Milford Haven, is one of
five sister ships, four of which are now understood to have sunk. It had
just undergone a two-year refit at the Keppel shipyard in Singapore.

FT  15 APR 91 / US forces in Iraq begin withdrawal to 'buffer zone'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US FORCES in southern Iraq have begun to withdraw to a border 'buffer zone'
in which they will continue to protect Iraqi refugees, Mr Richard Cheney,
the US defence secretary, said yesterday.
Thousands of fleeing Kurds and other Iraqis have moved into the Euphrates
area since the end of the Gulf war where they have been protected by
American troops.
'We clearly are not going to withdraw and end the effort in a way that
leaves these people vulnerable, or results in more deaths than otherwise
would have occurred,' said Mr Cheney.
The 15km-wide buffer zone is 10km in Iraq and 5km in Kuwait. US troops will
provide protection and relief until the area can be turned over to
international authorities.
The Iraqi military was yesterday continuing its attacks on Kurdish
rebel-held northern areas a day after President Saddam Hussein told refugees
they had nothing to fear if they returned to their homes.
The Iraqi leader, making one of his now rare public appearances, visited the
Kurdish town of Irbil near the Turkish border at the weekend and repeated
his amnesty offer.
'What is past is past. We are starting anew,' Mr Saddam told local Ba'ath
party officials.
In Baghdad, a United Nations delegation began talks on the refugee crisis.
Mr Eric Suy, a Belgian official leading the team, met Mr Saadoun Hammadi,
Iraq's prime minister, and other government officials yesterday.
Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, arrived in Tehran,
the Iranian capital, on Saturday, to determine the refugees' immediate
needs.
In south-east Turkey yesterday a massive relief airdrop by US, UK and French
aircraft was continuing. Two UK Chinook helicopters made their first drops
near Semdinli on the border, where bad roads have hampered efforts to reach
thousands of refugees. The Chinooks will be joined by an additional seven
helicopters.
The US is also deploying 16 helicopters at a base near the border to ferry
emergency aid.
The first of 3,500 US soldiers deployed to help in the relief effort arrived
at a port in southern Turkey yesterday aboard three warships. At Van, an
Ilyushin transport aircraft carrying EC food and medical aid arrived over
the weekend.
The government in Ankara is under increased pressure to relent on its policy
of confining the refugees to border areas where lack of accessibility and
the severe climate is threatening the relief effort.

FT  15 APR 91 / Major hits back over attacks on leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday hit back at charges of 'dithering' over reform of
the poll tax by dismissing attacks from opposition leaders and criticism
from the Thatcherite right as 'juvenile name calling'.
Justifying the delayed publication of plans for a new local government tax,
the prime minister said it would be folly to issue a consultation document
without time to examine the options on what was a 'really important' long
term strategic decision.
He went on to counter accusations that he is indecisive on controversial
issues by pointing to his move to join the European Community's exchange
rate mechanism and his handling of the Gulf war.
The much-awaited consultation document on the poll tax's replacement would
be published shortly, he said.
Mr Major's defence against growing questioning of his leadership style
dominated his first lengthy television interview since taking office.
It came just a day before Sir Alan Walters, the former special economic
adviser to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, was due, in another television programme,
to lend his weight to right-wing claims that the government lacks direction.
In a bid to maintain last week's Labour offensive, Mr Neil Kinnock, the
party leader, characterised the Tory party as hopelessly split both on the
poll tax and on Europe.
The defensive tone of the prime minister's London Weekend Television
interview, nonetheless, led some Tories to question why the party leader had
been allowed to face the cameras at a time when the poll tax consultation
document had still not been published.
With the local government election campaign now entering its second week, it
immediately provoked fresh attacks from opposition parties which have seized
on criticism of Mr Major's style from the Tory right to hammer home the
'weak leadership' charge.
The public discussion of Mr Major's abilities came after public carping from
a leading Young Conservative and last week's highly critical statement from
officials of the anti-federalist Bruges Group over Europe.
Clearly irritated by repeated questioning on the government's new local tax,
Mr Major was unable to do more than insist that the public must 'wait and
see'.
In an effort to head off the accusation that the time taken to find a
solution to local government financing was due to the Cabinet's attempts to
'fudge' the issue, he replied: 'It is not going to linger on and on and on
and on.'
The prime minister was dismissive of criticism from Sir Alan Walters, due to
be broadcast on the BBC's Panorama programme tonight. This claims that while
Mr Major is 'an extraordinarily good executive' he has not conveyed a sense
of the ideas and principles that drive him.
Mr Major reminded viewers that earlier criticism from Sir Alan had
incorrectly warned that Britain's entry into the ERM would mean devaluation
and an inability to lower interest rates.
The prime minister also defended his policy of creating an enclave for
Kurdish refugees in Iraq, saying Britain had been the first country to react
with humanitarian aid and had taken the initiative in proposing solutions.
Pressed on whether he would support the use of troops to defend the Kurds,
he replied: 'I am neither ruling it in nor ruling it out. Nobody knows what
may be the situation in the future.'
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrats' leader, accused the prime minister
of failing to demonstrate decisive or imaginative leadership.

FT  15 APR 91 / Dynamic duo square up for an educational test: Michael
Prowse on America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Batman and Robin are swinging into action, determined to transform American
education. Batman is Mr Lamar Alexander, President George Bush's new
education secretary, who won a reputation as an educational reformer while
governor of Tennessee in the 1980s. Robin, his deputy, is Mr David Kearns,
chairman of Xerox and a leading campaigner for educational change in the
business world.
The Alexander-Kearns team is unusually talented by the low standards of the
US public sector. Mr Alexander actually sounds intelligent on television;
with fewer brains he might make a Republican presidential candidate. Mr
Kearns is one of only a handful of top US executives to take a senior post
in an unfashionable department. An educationalist who knows both men says
their 'silky-smooth exteriors hide aggressive, action-oriented
personalities'. Both have shown a long-term interest in education; both are
used to getting their way. But can they deliver results that will justify Mr
Bush's claim to be the 'education president'?
Their headaches include:
Egregiously low average levels of achievement. Two-thirds of high school
students cannot place the American Civil War within the correct
half-century. The average mathematical attainment of Japanese pupils exceeds
that of the top 5 per cent of US students.
Low calibre of teachers. Four-fifths of science teachers did not major in
science at college. According to Mr Albert Shanker, the president of the
American Federation of Teachers, a third of physics teachers never took a
course in physics, not even in high school.
Bureaucratic school districts. Mr Denis Doyle of the Hudson Institute says
as much as 40 per cent of total educational expenditure is absorbed in
non-instructional overheads and bloated administration. Schools are big
(4,000 pupils is not uncommon), impersonal and inflexible.
High drop-out rates. The overall drop-out rate is about 28 per cent. But in
inner cities and among minorities, it is much higher. (Some drop-outs
subsequently pass a high school equivalency examination at college but this
does not excuse schools' initial failure to motivate them.)
Alexander and Kearns will unveil their strategy for reviving US schools
shortly. It is expected to focus on two themes: choice and accountability.
Choice is a shorthand for policies which encourage greater competition
between schools. During the 1980s, many reformers became convinced that
schools performed poorly because they had captive markets. Several states
are already promoting greater competition. Liberal Minnesota, allows parents
to cross district boundaries and choose any public school in the state.
But radicals want to go much further. Allowing parents to choose freely is
of limited significance, they say, if all schools are controlled by
bureaucratic school districts. Reformers such as Mr John Chubb at the
Brookings Institution want different groups to be able to compete for the
right to run public schools. Mr Alexander, who has spoken of the need to
'reinvent the public school', appears to favour such radicalism.
Accountability is a codeword for an even more controversial idea: national
tests. The US, alone among industrialised countries, lacks a comprehensive
examination system. There is nothing comparable with the French
baccalaureat, the British A-level or the German Abitur. The few tests that
are used, for example for college entry, are typically of multiple-choice
format, and designed to measure aptitude rather than achievement. Like US
television, they consist of lots of items, none of which warrants more than
a few seconds' attention.
Reformers are beginning to recognise that the failure to test properly lies
at the heart of educational problems in the US. Mr Bush has set some
ambitious (and improbable) goals, such as that US students should be 'first
in the world in math and science by 2000'. But how will the US know if it is
gaining ground on Japan unless it introduces a decent examination system?
And how can greater choice help to raise standards if parents lack objective
information about schools' attainment levels? National tests are common
sense. But that will not stop them being violently opposed, for example, as
an infringement of individual liberties.
Plans for greater choice are less threatening. But faith in them may be
misplaced. If competition is so important, why has it has played only a
minor role in other countries? The biggest difference between the US and
educationally more successful countries lies not in structure (most systems
are bureaucratic) but in simple things such as effort and discipline.
Children attend school for 180 days a year in the US compared with 243 in
Japan and about 230 in Germany. US students do only three-and-a-half hours'
homework a week. And they avoid difficult courses: many do little maths and
science; almost none masters a foreign language.
The arrival of the Alexander-Kearns team augurs well: it suggests that the
Bush administration, at last, is serious about educational reform. But, like
the Batman and Robin of Gotham City, this dynamic duo will often appear to
face impossible odds.
Ironically, the biggest roadblock is the US Constitution. Powers not
specifically granted to federal government are reserved for the states.
Education is one such power. State and local government provide 95 per cent
of the funds for education.
Washington is largely impotent. It cannot enforce greater competition,
impose national tests or lengthen the school year. What it can do is preach
eloquently and hope against hope that somebody out there is listening.

FT  15 APR 91 / Money Markets: The D-Mark wanes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROBLEMS stemming from German unification have changed sentiment surrounding
the D-Mark. It is no longer such a restraining influence on monetary policy
among the members of the European exchange rate mechanism, and by its own
weakness against the dollar threatens to increase inflationary pressure in
the ERM group as all currencies are dragged lower.
The straitjacket placed on British interest rate policy, when the pound was
at the bottom of the ERM, has been removed as funds have flowed out of the
D-Mark and into the high yielding pound, pushing sterling to the second
strongest in the system.
UK rates were set to fall as inflation declined, but the malaise surrounding
the D-Mark has made the task of cutting rates much easier, despite a
tightening of German monetary policy.
It is not clear whether last week's increase in the Bundesbank's fixed
securities repurchase agreement rate will result in higher official rates at
Thursday's central bank council meeting. Nevertheless, the rise was
opportune. It came on the same day that Germany announced its second
consecutive monthly current account deficit.
Economists at London's National Westminster Bank expect Germany's current
account surplus to shrink to Dollars 12bn from Dollars 44.1bn this year, and
believe a deficit is possible, with the strains placed on the economy by the
east meaning there is little realistic chance of recovery in the next couple
of years.
NatWest does not expect much further weakening of the D-Mark however, and it
forecasts that the dollar will average DM1.72 in the fourth quarter, while
sterling will have weakened to DM2.89 from the present level of almost
DM3.00.

FT  15 APR 91 / International Bonds: Torpor as investors rethink asset
allocation strategies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international bond market appears to be drifting further into limbo
following a period of almost unprecedented new issue activity during
February and early March. The flurry of new issues immediately after Easter
could not be sustained, making last week perhaps the most frustrating for
syndicate managers since before the Gulf war.
Added to the usual complaints that arbitrage opportunities in the currency
and interest swaps market are not available to borrowers, deeper factors are
stifling activity.
One explanation for the torpor is that many of the institutional investors
which dominate the Eurobond market are currently re-formulating asset
allocation strategies for the coming quarter. These reviews include
decisions on types of asset (equities, bonds, cash) and on currencies within
each category.
This strategy-making is important for Japanese institutional investors,
after their financial year end on March 31. Moreover, the attitude of
Japanese investors this financial year is central to the level of activity
in the international bond market.
Daiwa, the second largest Japanese securities firm, estimates that Japanese
life insurance companies will cut their holdings of foreign securities from
30 per cent of total portfolio to just 17 per cent this year. The figures
are based on an annual survey of institutional investors which usually
provides an accurate indication of future investment patterns.
Moreover, new funds available to these investors for allocation will fall
from Y12,000bn in the last financial year to Y10,000bn in fiscal 1991.
The investment behaviour of the life insurance companies is a reasonable
guide to the asset allocation plans of other Japanese institutions. For
example, the larger pension fund investors and City banks might be expected
to follow a similar pattern of asset allocation in the coming year.
Such figures do not promise a bumper year for the international bond market.
More importantly in the near term, the process is taking place against
uncertainty over the economic prospects in general, and the direction of
interest rates in particular, in many of the big economies.
A surprise factor has been the speed with which outright economic gloom has
been replaced by budding optimism. The conclusion of the Gulf war with a
minimum of economic disruption has added to hopes for higher growth and
fuelled fears of higher inflation.
Many analysts now expect the US economy to rally in the second half of the
year, which may cause the Federal Reserve to put a floor on its recent
aggressive easing of monetary conditions. Against this, bond market analysts
in Europe remain gloomy about the prospects for the US economy, and are
therefore hopeful that rates will come down further.
In particular, there is a school of thought that the lowering of US interest
rates will benefit the banking system rather than promote growth in the
economy as a whole. The difference between the Fed funds rate (at which
liquidity is supplied to the commercial banking system) and the prime rate
(on which much personal lending is based) currently stands at around 300
basis points, high by historic levels. Although this has restored lending
margins in the US banking system, it may not alleviate the 'credit squeeze'
for US firms.
'The normal transmission mechanism from lower interest rates into increased
economic activity is not expected to work fully in this cycle because of the
high level of debt held by the personal and corporate sectors,' said Mr
Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International. 'The banks remain
reluctant to lend despite recent rate cuts.'
In European markets it is unclear how far monetary conditions in most
economies can ease while inflationary pressures for higher German interest
rates remain strong.
Despite the gloomy statements by Bundesbank president Mr Karl-Otto Poehl,
the German discount rate has not been raised from the 6 1/2 per cent level
set on January 31. However, Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank council
will again be preceded by intense speculation.
Against this background, the problem for bond market investors lies in
judging how far UK, French and other authorities can relax monetary
conditions.
The current weakness of the D-Mark within the European exchange-rate
mechanism gives them some room for manoeuvre. The UK government's decision
to shave interest rates by a further  1/2 percentage point to 12 per cent on
Friday proves the point. However, investors are aware that there are limits
to how far monetary policies can diverge within the context of exchange-rate
co-operation.
Overall, the outlook for fixed interest markets vis-a-vis other types of
assets looks more clouded than even two months ago. Equally, the foreign
exchange markets appear to be at a watershed following the dollar's
startling surge during March.
'On a 12-18 month view, bond yields are expect to be lower in all countries
except Japan,' said Goldman Sachs in its latest World Investment Strategy.
'However, in the short term we expect bond yields to actually rise. A
perception that activity in the US is about to pick up has led to fears that
the Federal Reserve will stop easing. Further, the worsening prospects for
inflation in Germany might lead to rates rising there.'

FT  15 APR 91 / Syndicated Loans: Turkish bank leads return to market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the Gulf crisis keeping Turkish borrowers away from the syndicated
loans market, last week heralded the first significant financing for a
Turkish name in several months.
Turkiye Is Bankasi, Turkey's largest privately-owned commercial bank, is
arranging a one-year Dollars 100m facility through Chase Investment Bank.
The deal will provide money for the bank's Turkish customers to finance
exports. Turkiye Is Bankasi has not borrowed in the Euroloan market since
1988.
Chase, the underwriter and arranger of the loan, is now in the process of
finding other banks to sub-underwrite slots of Dollars 15m with an
underwriting fee of 15 basis points. Once this has been arranged, Chase will
start syndicating the loan.
Bankers said the interest margin was 62 1/2 basis points over the London
interbank offered rate (Libor), and there was a drawing down fee of 12 1/2
basis points (the drawing down period is three months). Bankers point out
that a 75 basis point total on each drawing denotes a reasonably aggressive
pricing for a Turkish borrower. The commitment fee on the undrawn portion is
37 1/2 basis points.
During the Gulf war, the syndicated loan market was virtually closed to
Turkish industrial borrowers. Terms were particularly unfavourable,
creating, according to bankers, a lot of pent-up demand. Bankers point out
that the pricings for the handful of small loans which did emerge were
rather high. They point to Esbank of Turkey, which has a Dollars 25m
one-year loan arranged by the Bank of New York Capital Markets with an
interest margin of 100 basis points.
As the Turkiye Is Bankasi deal is the largest facility to emerge from Turkey
for several months, its progress will be watched with interest by other
Turkish borrowers waiting to come to the market.
American General, the US insurance and financial services group, arranged a
much larger facility last week: a Dollars 2.6bn one-year transaction through
Credit Suisse First Boston and Chemical Bank.
The facility is a back-up to the company's commercial paper programme; in
essence a standby credit which American General can fall back on in the
event of the US commercial paper market drying up again (which is what
happened after the default of Wang Laboratories on the repayment of its
short-term debt in 1989). There is a facility fee of  1/8 point, and the
interest margin is  1/4 point over Libor.
Mirror Group Newspapers, the company that Mr Robert Maxwell plans to float
soon, has arranged a Pounds 150m, three-year revolving credit intended for
the company's use once it is a public company. It is an offer with four
joint arrangers - Barclays Bank (which is also the book runner doing the
actual syndication), Credit Lyonnais, Lloyds Bank and Midland Bank. Terms
have not been disclosed.
A clutch of Italian borrowers has come to the syndicated loan market in
recent weeks. Of these, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro's investment arm (BNL) is
arranging a medium-term Ecu430m (Dollars 546m) syndicated loan for Sezione
Autonoma di Credito Fondiario di BNL, its mortgage finance arm.
BNL is syndicating an Ecu227m tranche with a seven-and-a half-year maturity.
The commitment fee is 15 basis points and the interest margin is 32 1/2
basis points over Libor for the first three years and 35 basis points over
Libor thereafter.

FT  15 APR 91 / Australian Bonds: Employment figures trigger sharp rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK WESTFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST week the Australian bond market gave investors some of their best
action for months. Long-term treasury bond yields dropped 26 basis points
during hectic trading to 11.08 per cent, their lowest level for 11 years,
and three-year bonds slid under 11 per cent to 10.9 per cent.
Last week's yield contraction turned suddenly into a full-blooded rally when
institutional traders and investors realised they had to grab what could be
the last of some of the developed world's highest long-term returns before
yields and the economy fell even further, into a recessionary heap.
The buying, when it came, was all the more frantic because a
smaller-than-expected treasury bond tender of ADollars 800m (USDollars 630m)
announced early in the week suggested that stock would be scarcer than
earlier anticipated.
After three years of federal government surpluses and large-scale bond
buybacks by Canberra, blue chip Commonwealth bonds are now in short supply.
Aggressive buying by Japanese institutions also heightened fears that
trading stock would be limited.
The catalyst for the rush on bonds and, to a lesser extent, three-month
securities was news that employment had fallen by a further 82,400, and that
the unemployment rate had risen from 8.7 per cent to a worrying 9.2 per
cent. To put this employment drop in perspective, it would be equivalent to
a deterioration of 1m jobs in the US.
The market believes this sharp fall in employment will lead to inflation -
currently 6.9 per cent - falling faster and further than expected.
According to Mr Vince Le Blanco, a dealer at Bankers Trust Australia, the
country is one of the few which has brought recession upon itself rather
than being dragged down by the downturn in the US, UK and Canada.
'It is out of step with the other industrialised economies. Australian
inflation is falling faster than these other western economies so everyone
is climbing in for the long bonds.'
Traders had begun the week buying long bonds with some confidence when the
Reserve Bank clipped 0.5 per cent off the official cash rate, reducing it
from 12 to 11.5 per cent.
Thursday's alarming jobless statistic convinced the market that further
easing of official rates would follow and so turned the buying into a
stampede.
Mr Robert Credano, a fixed interest analyst at Macquarie Bank, says lower
inflationary expectation had been responsible for reducing long-term bond
yields, and the easing of monetary policy triggered the drop in short-term
rates.
'The reduced inflationary outlook has had the greater effect on the long end
of the market,' he said.
This change of sentiment over the week is quite significant, given that the
market had been reluctant to push yields down this far in either the 1986 or
1983 recessions.
After three years of punishing official interest rates and heart-breaking
current account deficits, the authorities appear finally to have snapped the
back of inflation, but at the cost of breaking the economy.
This success has come at a further cost of the growing number of jobless in
Australia, but for the bond market the news is all good.

FT  15 APR 91 / US Money and Credit: Confusion over Fed's slow reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILL the Federal Reserve ease again? Yes, if you have faith in Wall Street's
army of bond analysts, most of whom are predicting a cut in US interest
rates some time in the next few days.
Last week's better-than-expected inflation news - producer prices fell 0.3
per cent and consumer prices 0.1 per cent during March - should have been
the green light the Fed was waiting for.
The numbers were encouraging. The 0.1 per cent decline in the consumer price
index was the first monthly fall since 1986. The data showed moderation in
housing prices continuing; commodity prices still falling; a slowdown in the
growth of prices for services; and a sharp deceleration of core inflation,
minus food and energy prices.
Mr Ed Yardeni, analyst at CJ Lawrence, now predicts annual inflation for the
year will be 3.2 per cent, a figure even the fiercest of anti-inflation
hawks could live with.
The dollar's recent strength has also been a stroke of luck for the monetary
authorities. An appreciating US currency will negate the threat of imported
inflation, and should give the Fed additional room to lower borrowing costs.
However, the failure of the Fed to respond to all the good news with an
immediate cut in interest rates has upset financial markets, which had been
expecting - or rather, hoping - that Friday morning would see either the
discount rate or the Federal funds rate lowered by 25 or 50 basis points.
Not everyone got into a kerfuffle over the lack of immediate Fed action; the
bond market managed to hold on to some of its gains on Friday. The stock
market, however, lost its cool. Share prices rose on hearing the inflation
data, then fell quickly on the lack of a Fed move, before finally recovering
to end higher as dealers and investors looked forward to an easing this
week.
So why did not the Fed ease on Friday? The search for an explanation reached
desperate proportions during the afternoon. The wire services reported
speculation in the market that the Fed did not ease because Mr Alan
Greenspan, the chairman, was attending the funeral of Senator John Heinz on
Friday morning. This meant Mr Greenspan was unable to be at the Fed's
offices - just two miles from the cemetery - to twist the necessary Open
Market Committee arms and push through an immediate rate cut.
Another, only slightly more plausible, explanation was that the Fed did not
move on Friday because it did not want to give the market the impression
that the decision to cut rates was a hurried one, made without the full
support of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee.
Much has been made in recent weeks of supposed divisions with the FOMC, and
some analysts believe the Fed is sensitive to accusations that it is
divided. Mr Richard Trainer, chief market economist at Bank of Tokyo's
treasury group, said on Friday: 'The timing is important . . . with all this
discussion of division, I don't think a quick vote over the telephone will
give the right message.'
A more likely explanation is that the Fed delayed its hand in order to give
the markets more time to digest last week's economic news.
The last time the Fed cut the discount rate in a hurry, in February, the
long end of the bond market took a tumble, unnerved by the swiftness of the
rate reduction. Critics later said the speed with which rates were lowered
indicated Mr Greenspan had temporarily put his concerns about inflation to
one side, and succumbed to political pressure to cut rates.
This time, the Fed chairman may have decided a short pause for thought
before easing would keep the inflation hawks, both inside and outside the
Fed, off his back.
There is one other explanation for the lack of a rate cut on Friday: the Fed
may have eased already. Mr Bob DiClemente of Salomon Brothers is one
Fed-watcher who believes reserve data and the persistence of a Fed funds
rate below the 6 per cent target suggests the Fed may have already moved,
behind the market's back.
Persuasive though Mr DiClemente's arguments may be, the market would still
like the Fed to give a clear signal that rates have been cut. If we can
assume that the new target for Fed funds is 5 1/2 per cent, which is what
Friday's matched sales transaction by the Fed appeared to indicate, then a
discount rate cut of 50 basis points to 5 1/2 per cent should satisfy
everyone.

FT  15 APR 91 / UK Gilts: Oversupply fears as tap stock sits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ONE matter worried the gilts market last week, it was the fear of
oversupply. The Bank of England's Pounds 800m new tap stock was
undersubscribed on Wednesday and, as if that was not enough, the market
faces the prospect of an auction in just over a week.
The gilts market has been directionless in recent days: Friday's news that
the UK Retail Prices Index rose at an annual rate of 8.2 per cent in March,
down from 8.9 per cent in February, was welcomed, but the half-point cut in
the base rate had already been discounted. On Friday, gilts prices closed
lower, ending half a point down on the day.
The latest tranche of Treasury 9 per cent stock, 2008, offered on Wednesday,
had a minimum price of 94 1/2 , but the existing stock was trading at about
half a point below that. As one trader put it, only a fool would buy from
the Bank of England when they could buy the same stock for less in the
market. One of the largest market makers said it did no business in the tap
stock.
The Bank, however, pointed out that the last time a tender was thought too
highly priced - which was in January when it offered Pounds 500m of 10 per
cent conversion stock 1996 - the gilts market moved up and the whole tranche
was taken up within two days at more than the minimum tender price.
So the latest tap stock will sit awaiting buyers until either the market
moves up and the price of the existing 9 per cent stock 2008 passes the 94
1/2 minimum tender price, or the Bank cuts the price. Many of those in the
market have been asking themselves why the Bank set the price at 94 1/2 -
and most have concluded that it may have misjudged the market trend.
Furthermore, many are curious as to why the Bank chose to tap the longer end
of the market. The Bank itself says there is strong demand for long-dated
gilts, particularly from overseas investors. It is true that foreigners have
been attracted to the gilts market in recent weeks, lured by yields at the
short end of the market and the strength of sterling. Yet market makers
point out that most foreign investors - except US investors who, like UK
investors, are used to maturities of over a decade - feel more comfortable
with medium-dated government bonds, that is bonds of a similar maturity to
those in their domestic markets.
Consequently, there has been much speculation on the subject. Mr John
Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg, says that issuing a 9 per cent gilt at
the long end of the market makes the government's funding look rather
expensive, especially if the government is forecasting a fall in headline
inflation to 4 per cent by the end of the year.
Assuming the government believes its own forecasts, it must be under
considerable funding pressure and therefore does not have the luxury of
simply concentrating on the short end of the market. With some economists
forecasting that the government will have to borrow up to Pounds 12bn this
year, it may be that gilts issues will have to take place across a range of
maturities, even if the bias is towards the short and medium maturities.
Another suggestion is that the Bank of England knows it has a lot of funding
to do over the next few months and wants to discourage corporate borrowing
at the long end of the market - hence its decision to issue at that end of
the market early on. There is already a fairly good supply of corporate
bonds at the long end of the market and many more companies may want to
borrow there if base rates continue to fall.
Tomorrow, the Bank will announce details of the gilt auction scheduled for
April 24. So far, all that is known is that between Pounds 1bn and Pounds
2bn of stock will be issued, and that the maturity will be of up to seven
years. Mr Shepperd points out that yields at the short end of the market may
have to increase if the market is to absorb such a large amount of stock.

FT  15 APR 91 / International Company News: Westinghouse on target with 53%
profit plunge

<TEXT>
WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the diversified US technology group, has reported a
53 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings, in line with company forecasts.
The company recently announced a restructuring, particularly of its troubled
financial services subsidiary. In this area, it plans to sell or liquidate
about Dollars 3bn in under-performing assets over the next few years.
Net income for the three months ended March 31 was Dollars 98m, or 34 cents
a share, on revenues of Dollars 2.78bn, against profits of Dollars 210m, or
71 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 2.86bn in the 1990 first quarter.
Mr Paul Lego, chairman, said the company expected economic conditions to
improve, particularly in the second half.
Operating profits in the first quarter were Dollars 157m, giving an
operating margin of 5.7 per cent, against Dollars 294m and a 10.3 per cent
margin in the same period last year.
The company's broadcasting business had substantially lower operating
profits. Westinghouse blamed this on the recession and the effect of the
Gulf war on advertising. Revenues were essentially flat.
Recession also hurt operating profits at Westinghouse's Electronic Systems
unit, particularly in the non-defence area. The deterioration was attributed
to start-up costs.
The company's financial services also had worse operating profits for the
quarter, thanks to a lack of gains from the sale of equity interest in
financing transactions, and significantly higher levels of non-earning
receivables.
Westinghouse's main financial services subsidiary, Westinghouse Credit, had
net income of Dollars 21.2m on revenues of Dollars 255.4m, against Dollars
42m on revenues of Dollars 282.8m last time.
Westinghouse, along with the rest of the US financial services industry, has
been hit by sharp erosion in property, junk bonds and highly-leveraged
companies.
The company's power generation business, which turned in a strong fourth
quarter, had substantially lower operating profits. The company attributed
these to non-recurring licensee income in the 1990 first quarter.

German expansion

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DRESDNER BANK, Germany's second largest commercial bank, reported only a
modest rise in group profits for 1990 after a big rise in spending caused by
its expansion in east Germany, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt.
Partial operating profits, which exclude trading on the bank's own account,
were 4 per cent higher at DM1.95bn (Dollars 1.2bn).
Mr Wolfgang Roller, chief executive, said the bank's trading on its own
account amounted to about DM500m in an average year. Trading income did not
reach the high level of 1989 because of the world stock market downturn, but
showed a sharp rise on the foreign exchange side.
Dresdner's net interest income was 12 per cent higher at DM4.7bn, with fee
income up by only 1.7 per cent to DM1.8bn, reflecting the decline on
securities markets. Administration costs rose 11 per cent to DM4.6bn, with
much of the rise stemming from expansion in east Germany.
Mr Roller said Dresdner hoped to agree planned cross-shareholdings with
Banque Nationale de Paris, the French state-owned bank, now the French
government had made such a step easier. Commerzbank had also said it hoped
soon to announce a cross-holding with Credit Lyonnais.
Dresdner wrote down its securities holdings by more than DM500m. It also
increased lending risk provisions, which now cover 60 countries.
About 60 per cent of its sovereign debt of DM5.5bn is now covered by such
provisions, which include the Soviet Union. Dresdner's net profits were up
42 per cent to DM921m due to the incorporation of Dresdner Bank Berlin.

ALUMINUM Company of America (Alcoa), the world's biggest producer of
aluminium whose performance is a gauge of America's industrial economy, has
posted a 34.7 per cent drop in first quarter earnings on a 9 per cent
decline in revenues, writes Karen Zagor.
Net income for the first three months of 1991 was Dollars 97m on revenues of
Dollars 2.41bn, against earnings of Dollars 148.6m on revenues of Dollars
2.64bn a year ago. Earnings per share slid 32.5 per cent to Dollars 1.14
from Dollars 1.69. The 1991 earnings included favourable translation and
exchange adjustments of Dollars 10.2m or 12 cents a share.
In the 1990 first quarter, Alcoa's earnings included adjustments of 5 cents
a share.

<TEXT>
FIRST Chicago, the eleventh biggest US bank, has posted first-quarter net
income of Dollars 49.5m, down 28 per cent from Dollars 68.6m in 1990, as
higher non-performing assets, particularly in real estate, put pressure on
earnings.
Earnings per share dropped 32 per cent in the quarter to 63 cents, in line
with expectations.
Mr Barry Sullivan, chairman, said the earnings reflected the overall
sluggishness in the US economy.
First Chicago's non-performing assets rose in the first quarter, mainly in
the real estate portfolio.
Non-performing assets at the end of March were Dollars 1.6bn, up from
Dollars 1.4bn at the end of 1990.
Barnett Banks, the leading Florida banking company with Dollars 32.1bn in
assets, turned in first-quarter net earnings of Dollars 18.3m, or 28 cents a
share, against Dollars 15.5m or 25 cents a year earlier.

<TEXT>
OERLIKON-BUHRLE, the Swiss industrial and armaments group, plans a radical
restructuring of capital to absorb heavy losses and open the way for an
outside partner to buy into the group's troubled defence business.
The company said the measures, which involve a 60 per cent capital reduction
and the issue of new shares, were needed to return its defence division to
profit. It said talks with several potential partners were under way.
Oerlikon, which has run into losses mainly because it failed to find buyers
for its Adats anti-aircraft weaponry, has been under reorganisation by a
specially-appointed task force since last September, following the
resignation of chairman Mr Dietrich Burle.
The Adats guided missile system was developed at a cost of some SFr1bn
(Dollars 704.2m). During the 1980s, Oerlikon's defence division accumulated
losses of more than SFr1bn.
Oerlikon announced in January it planned to sell a majority shareholding in
its defence business, and that talks to this end were under way.
The new shares, representing SFr300m nominal of bearer shares, will be taken
up by the banks as payment for some SFr300m of group debt. Later this year
the banks will offer the new shares to Oerlikon shareholders.
Oerlikon in 1990 made an operating loss of SFr91.2m, up from a deficit in
1989 of SFr41.3m, which included a loss of SFr100m by the defence side.
Earlier this year, Oerlikon said operating losses for 1990 would fall
between SFr70m and SFr100m.

<TEXT>
NIPPON STEEL, the world's largest steel producer, is moving into computer
manufacturing as part of a plan to diversify into electronics and
information systems.
Its first product, to be launched in the UK tomorrow, is a 'notebook'
computer weighing less than six pounds but with all the functions of a
desk-top personal system.
The computer, called 'Librex' is being launched in the US and UK but not yet
in Japan. Mr Takashi Iwamoto, president of Nippon Steel Computer based in
Langley, Berkshire, said the Japanese market for small computers was
dominated by NEC. He said competition in the notebook sector was especially
intense.
New competitors stood a better chance of building a market presence in the
US and Europe, where notebook computers are only now becoming popular.
He said the company would eventually manufacture the notebook machines in
Europe. It had recruited Mr Ian King from Toshiba to manage the UK operation
and Mr Andrew Carver from Compaq, the leading US personal computer supplier,
to head European sales and marketing.
Nippon Steel, with annual sales in excess of Dollars 20bn, is entering the
computer business as a response to slow growth in its traditional business.
One of the largest users of industrial computers in Japan, it has already
established joint ventures for marketing equipment from US companies.

THE NEW York State insurance department said it would decide early this week
what action to take over Executive Life of New York.
Executive Life of New York is the smaller of the two main operating units
within First Executive, the big Californian life insurance company. The
Californian Insurance Department seized control of First Executive's larger
operating unit, Executive Life, last week.
Problems at First Executive stem from the insurer's heavy exposure to 'junk
bonds'. The company was a big customer of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the
investment bank which pioneered the growth of the high-yielding securities.
First Executive's operating units have some Dollars 50bn of life insurance
in force.

VW, the German car group, announced an unchanged dividend of DM11 per

showed only a slight rise, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt.
VW said net profits in 1990 were slightly above the DM1.04bn (Dollars 619m)

in South America, and the strong D-Mark.
In the first nine months, pre-tax profits were 19 per cent lower at DM1.7bn.

<TEXT>
Taxable profits at Olives Holdings, the paper making and property
development and general investment group, fell from Pounds 1.49m to Pounds
854,000 in the year to December 31.
However this was struck after an exceptional credit of Pounds 1.22m (debit
Pounds 621,000) relating to the disposal of a holding in a subsidiary, and
after losses of Pounds 305,000 from the company's 40 per cent interest in
Continental Paper, an associated undertaking. Continental also accounted for
an extraordinary charge of Pounds 218,000 (nil).
Turnover declined to Pounds 9.82m (Pounds 13.73m) and earnings dropped from
12.98p to 9.06p per share. As Continental is now showing signs of profit,
the directors are holding the final dividend at 6p for a 9p total (same).

Lower prices realised for its crops and an increase in overheads meant
pre-tax profits at Anglo-Eastern Plantations crashed from Pounds 911,000 to
Pounds 235,000 in 1990.
On top of that, the tax charge did not fall in line with profits because of
withholding tax on fixed loan interest payments, Mr HJ Renton, chairman,
explained. Earnings per share, therefore, dropped from 2p to 0.4p and the
dividend is omitted. Last time there was an interim and final of 1p each.
The group harvests rubber, oil palms and cocoa from estates in Indonesia.
Rubber and palm oil prices were the lowest since 1986 and cocoa the lowest
for ten years. In addition, as the Tasik estate neared maturity, the
proportion of overheads chargeable against revenue was increasing.
Volume at Tasik was moving ahead and, if the rise in the palm oil price was
maintained, the results were expected to show a 'good improvement'.

Interest costs and losses from an associate pushed William Jacks, the motor
group, Pounds 872,000 into the red in the year to January 31. There was a
particularly severe downturn in the last quarter of the year, with 'very
disappointing' sales in the normally buoyant month of January, the company
said.
On turnover down at Pounds 42.6m (Pounds 46.25m) operating profits were
reduced to Pounds 272,000 (Pounds 1.17m). Interest charges amounted to
Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 802,000) partly due to the financing of exceptionally
high stocks of unsold new cars delivered on consignment terms. There was a
Pounds 41,000 (Pounds 15,000) loss from associated undertakings.
Losses per share came through at 6.76p (2.09p earnings) and the directors
said there would be no dividend until there was an appreciable improvement
in trading conditions. They expected a gradual recovery beginning in the
second half of the year.

MR ROBERT Maxwell, the publisher, will this week decide the final details of
the flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers. The float is expected to value the

Mr Maxwell is at the New York Daily News, a recent loss-making acquisition
which will not be included in the float. He will return to London to take
the decision probably by Wednesday.
Between 40 per cent and 49 per cent of the company which Mr Maxwell bought
from Reed International in 1984 for Pounds 113m is expected to be floated.
The main newspapers are the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, The People, and the
Daily Record and Sunday Mail in Scotland.
Minority stakes in two Canadian companies, a commercial printer and a
newsprint group will also be included but not The European newspaper.
The Stock Exchange blocked plans to offer shares to Daily Mirror readers.
At the moment the intention is to split the offer equally between small
investors in the UK, institutions and overseas investors.
A larger proportion might be made available to American investors because of
Mr Maxwell's higher profile in the US following the Daily News purchase.

FT  15 APR 91 / UK Company News: Brent Walker expected to transfer Trocadero
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT WALKER, the troubled leisure conglomerate which underwent a major
refinancing last autumn, is expected to hand over its 50 per cent stake in
the Trocadero in London and in Blackpool's Tower shopping centre, in an
effort to reduce its high level of borrowings.
The group is expected to announce today that it is transferring its
shareholding in the two sites to Power Corporation, the Irish property
developer, in exchange for total ownership of the island site adjacent to
the Trocadero.
Power Corporation is joint partner in both projects through Walker Power,
the joint venture company in which the two groups each own a 50 per cent
holding.
The move will enable Brent Walker to reduce its Pounds 1.4bn of debt by
taking its share of the Trocadero's Pounds 170m of borrowings off its
balance sheet. This is the amount that has so far been drawn down from a
Pounds 270m facility provided to the Trocadero project.
Brent Walker is also likely to move quickly to dispose of the island site,
which consists of a number of separate properties and has a value of about
Pounds 75m, less unspecified borrowings. While the site was jointly owned,
it was unlikely that Power would have agreed to sell the properties on it at
current depressed prices. Last year, Brent Walker had been prepared to
consider a proposal of between Pounds 325m and Pounds 350m for the
Trocadero, but this was turned down by Power.
The Trocadero development, which is expected to be completed by the end of
this year, was valued at between Pounds 300m and Pounds 350m. On completion,
it is expected to bring in Pounds 16m in rental income and, together with
rent renewal income, is thought to have an estimated rental value of Pounds
22m to Pounds 23m. The borrowings of Walker Power are off balance sheet as
far as Power Corporation is concerned.

lawsuit
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A New York court will decide today whether to allow Laidlaw and ADT to speed
up proceedings under the lawsuit brought by the Canadian waste management
company as part of its efforts to force greater disclosure of ADT's affairs.
Laidlaw, the biggest shareholder, is seeking various injunctions against ADT
relating to disclosure of the Bermuda-based company's financial condition
and alleged violations of US securities laws.
By proceeding directly to the discovery stage, Laidlaw hopes the case can be
finalised before the scheduled reconvening on June 3 of a special ADT
meeting in Bermuda. Laidlaw used its 28.4 per cent shareholding earlier this
month to force adjournment of the meeting, which was to consider three ADT
proposals opposed by the Canadian company.
The fate of the lawsuit has become a central element in negotiations between
Mr Donald Jackson, Laidlaw chief executive, and Mr Michael Ashcroft,
chairman of ADT, to settle the differences between the two companies.
Mr Jackson told analysts in Toronto on Friday that Laidlaw will review the
value of its stake over the next few months to determine whether a writedown
is appropriate. In a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission,
Laidlaw said the market value was about USDollars 400m, less on February 28
than the carrying value of Dollars 950m.
Mr Jackson said Laidlaw was unable to develop a strategy for its stake until
it had a 'better understanding' of the state of affairs at the security and
car auction company. Meantime, it was keeping all options open, including
adding to or cutting its interest.
He added that ADT's earnings were expected to fall by 5-15 per cent this
year largely as a result of a decline in income from unspecified
non-operating sources. ADT last month reported a 22 per cent drop in 1990
earnings.
As for Laidlaw's own businesses, Mr Jackson acknowledged that North American
waste disposal had turned out to be more sensitive to the business cycle
than was previously thought.

FT  15 APR 91 / UK Company News: Tootal in war of words
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROY PERRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOOTAL, the textile group, listed several reasons in another document
yesterday why shareholders should reject the Pounds 194m hostile offer from
Coats Viyella. This was frozen last Friday until the Office of Fair Trading
decides whether or not to refer the bid to the Monopolies &amp; Mergers
Commission, writes Roy Perry.
Among allegations made by Tootal is that its rival has not demonstrated the
mangement skills necessary to integrate acquisitions effectively. It claimed
Vantona Viyella and Coats Patons made in total almost Pounds 50m more
pre-tax profits as separate entities in 1985 than the merged group in 1990.
The 'compelling logic' for a merger of the two businesses was flawed,
according to Tootal, which asserted that Coats was attempting to disguise
its failed textile conglomerate strategy by trying to buy Tootal on the
cheap.
Tootal argued that it has the right management, strategy and resources to
prosper as an independent group.
Coats Viyella countered swiftly. Mr Neville Bain, chief executive, said
yesterday: 'Tootal's change of mind on the logic of this merger is
breathtaking and raises fresh doubts about its credibility and strategy.'
He answered the failed strategy accusation with 'the merger of Vantona
Viyella and Coats Patons has been successful and its financial results must
be judged in the context of world-wide textile cycles since it was
consummated.'
'The Tootal board has denied shareholders important financial information by
withholding its balance sheet and cash flows and details of extraordinary
items. What is it trying to hide from them about its financial position,'
asked Mr Bain.

FT  15 APR 91 / UK Company News: TSB the first major to pull the plug -
Problems in the centralised mortgage market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEWS that Mortgage Express, the centralised mortgage lending arm of the
TSB Group, is to withdraw from the market, is likely to be greeted with a
stoical lack of surprise among other such lenders.
So far no other large centralised lender has closed its doors, but it is no
secret that many have been facing very hard times over the past two years.
One of the largest lenders, CIBC Mortgages, set up by Canadian Imperial Bank
of Commerce, Canada's second biggest bank with a Pounds 2bn UK mortgage
book, has been on the market for the past year without finding a buyer.
Other mortgage companies privately admit that they have sustained their
profitability only by pricing their mortgages at levels above the market.
That encouraged their customers to migrate to cheaper lenders, usually
building societies, and pay hefty early redemption penalties of three months
interest to do so.
Many, though far from all, of the foreign banks and life assurance groups
who flocked to the UK mortgage market during the 1980s would now like to be
given the chance to withdraw from it quietly. 'About two dozen mortgage
books, some of them very small, have been on the market since last summer,'
says one mortgage industry analyst.
These are forced sales by disappointed new entrants to the market, hoping to
cut their losses. They are quite different from well-publicised sales of
mortgage books a few years earlier by US lenders under pressure at home,
such as the 1986 sale of Bank of America's book to Bank of Ireland or the
1988 sale of Chemical Bank's UK book to BNP.
Few lenders publicly admit their decision to sell their books. Still less do
they discuss the reasons which make them want to leave the market.
'Many of the mortgage books I have been offered in the last few months are
riddled with doubtful quality lending. As a result, some are offered on
terms which virtually amount to paying a buyer to take them off the hands of
the original lender. Even so, few of them seem to be finding a buyer. Their
owners may wish to exit from the market but they can't,' says one mortgage
company.
Those centralised lenders who do see a long term future in the UK market,
such as Capital Home Loans, a joint venture between Societe Generale and
Credit Fonciere of France, favour a low profile approach and cautious
balance sheet growth for the foreseeable future.
By contrast Mortgage Express was a high profile lender during the height of
the housing finance boom. 'It grew very fast,' admitted Mr Hamish Paton, TSB
managing director for banking services, when announcing its closure last
week.
At the time Mortgage Express was regarded as one of TSB's strongest
performing subsidiaries: one of the most dynamic of the new breed of UK
mortgage lenders who expanded rapidly at the expense of the traditional
providers of housing finance, the building societies.
The thinking behind these new lenders was simple. They would tap the
commercial money markets for funds, and avoid high overheads, selling their
mortgages through panels of insurance companies rather than through branches
and in doing so undercut the building societies.
The centralised lenders also attracted customers by offering specialised
mortgages tailored to the individual needs, previously unknown in the UK and
designed to help buyers scramble up the property ladder.
While interest rates were low, this strategy worked well. In the second half
of 1987, they appeared to be achieving their goals in spectacular fashion.
The building societies' share of the mortgage market was temporarily driven
to below 50 per cent, while the new lenders claimed a market share of more
than a quarter. Previously unknown names like National Home Loans, The
Mortgage Corporation, and Household Mortgage Corporation, rapidly grew books
comparable to those of large building societies.
If Mortgage Express had been a building society, it would have ranked
eleventh by the size of its book after only three years of existence.
When interest rates moved back above 12 per cent in August 1988, the
advantage returned to the building societies with their ability to fund
their lending more cheaply from savings. Halifax, the largest society whose
rate is still generally followed by others, kept its rates as low as
possible in a deliberate squeeze on the centralised lenders.
The societies also quickly learned how to copy the new wave mortgages of the
centralised lenders and offer their customers a variety of fixed rate, low
start, or deferred interest mortgage products, in place of a single standard
mortgage.
Despite this, some centralised lenders fought hard in a hostile market.
National Home Loans last year reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 30.2m, down
on Pounds 33.5m in 1989.
Other centralised lenders were hit by arrears and repossessions as loans
made at the height of the mortgage market came unstuck. Mortgage Express was
forced to make provisions of Pounds 8m last against mortgage arrears. At the
same time, it was unable to keep its costs down, a surprising failure for an
organisation without a branch network, and its computer systems were
regarded within the group as inefficient.
When Mortgage Express lost two of its best executives, Mr Bob Green and Mr
Peter Sewell, to a new rival set up by a German bank, its decline seemed to
accelerate. As Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB's new chairman, and Mr Don
McCrickard, its chief executive, imposed a more coherent structure on the
group, Mortgage Express looked increasingly out of place. When most of TSB's
six mortgage arms were united as TSB Mortgages last summer, Mortgage Express
was left on the sidelines.
Its demise, nonetheless, marks the end of an era in its industry. Unless the
housing market makes a strong recovery this year, it may not be the only
large centralised lender to fall victim to the recession.

Williams said, however, that the proceeds from the issue to Prudential

borrowings of US subsidiaries of Yale &amp;Valor. The notes are guaranteed by

Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman of Williams, said the proceeds wouldreplace bank
borrowings, and strengthen the basis for the continuing growth of US

<TEXT>
THE US Federal Trade Commission is investigating Microsoft, the world's
largest software company, in a wide-ranging anti-trust inquiry.
Microsoft said it had been told that the FTC would examine third-party
allegations that Microsoft 'has monopolised or has attempted to monopolise
the market for operating systems, operating environments, computer software
and computer peripherals for personal computers'.
The company supplies the DOS personal computer operating system used in all
IBM-compatible personal computers.
Microsoft is also the largest supplier of applications software for personal
computers.
The group's long-standing ties with IBM have given it a pivotal role in the
personal computer industry. If Microsoft is found to have violated
anti-trust laws, as some competitors privately charge, the outcome is likely
to have a broad impact throughout the computer industry.
Previously, Microsoft had understood the investigation to be narrowly
focused on a 1989 joint statement with IBM in which the companies were
alleged to have agreed to limit the functionality of Windows, a Microsoft
personal computer programme.
Mr William Neukom, Microsoft vice-president of law and corporate affairs,
said: 'Microsoft is surprised and disappointed that the inquiry has been
broadened.
'We will continue to co-operate with this investigation,' added. 'We believe
that Microsoft has acted in a legal and ethical manner.'
The FTC, which is charged with investigating business practices that
restrict competition, declined to comment on the existence of the inquiry,
or its nature.
Microsoft's share price fell from a Thursday close of Dollars 111 to trade
at Dollars 106 1/2 on news of the investigation by the Federal Trade
Commission.

FT  15 APR 91 / TVS fails to find buyer for MTM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TVS Entertainment has withdrawn MTM from the market because it could not
obtain a satisfactory offer for the US independent production company.
The ITV company for the south of England bought the US group in July 1988
for Dollars 320m (Pounds 180.7m) in advance of a sharp decline in the
American programme syndication market.
The company has been attempting to sell MTM to Spelling Productions of the
US for about Dollars 70m but has been unable to obtain a 'clean contract'
without conditions.
TVS will now have to include MTM when it constructs its business plan and
bids for a new 10-year franchise licence from the beginning of 1993.
The deadline for bids in the competitive tenders for franchises is May 15
and TVS is expected to face opposition from MAI, the advertising and
financial service group, and from a David Frost/Virgin consortium.
TVS will continue to finance Evening Shade and Rosie O'Neill, if they are
renewed by the US networks and probably the remake of WKRP.
All other new shows will be financed one at a time.
TVS is still undecided at the highest level whether or not a new shareholder
is needed to add extra financial underpinning to the bid for a new licence.
There is a view that, with strong shareholders such as Canal Plus, the
successful French subscription television company, further support is
unnecessary.

<TEXT>
MORTGAGE EXPRESS, the TSB Group's centralised mortgage lending arm
established in 1986, is to withdraw from the market with the loss of about
40 sales jobs.
The move follows two months of unsuccessful attempts to sell the company,
which has a mortgage book of around Pounds 3bn. Mortgage Express was one of
the fastest-growing of the new lenders at the height of the housing boom in
1988, but last year it slipped into an undisclosed loss after making
bad-debt provisions of Pounds 8m.
These accounted for two-thirds of TSB's total provision against bad debts on
its retail banking operations.
Mortgage Express employs 420 people and is believed to be the third largest
of the centralised lending companies. Mr Hywel Luke, managing director, is
among the 40 members of Mortgage Express's 420 staff being made redundant
immediately. Most of the others belong to the company's sales force.
Although many insurance companies and foreign banks have placed their
mortgage businesses on the market in the last year, several - including
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce which had a book of about Pounds 2bn -
have been unable to find buyers. However, the decision to wind down a
business as large as Mortgage Express is unprecedented in the industry.
Mr Hamish Paton, TSB managing director for banking services, said the group
would now sell its mortgages through TSB Mortgages, its other property-based
lending subsidiary with a book of about Pounds 3.8m, via its branch network.
Mortgage Express's mortgages were distributed through 30 life assurance
companies. The closure is not expected to incur extraordinary expenses on
TSB's balance sheet when its interim results are announced in June.
More jobs will be shed at intervals as Mortgage Express's operations
contract in size over the next year or two.

FT  15 APR 91 / Supply threat to Norway's gas sales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SPIRALLING demand for gas from Europe's electricity industry is threatening
Norway's ability to supply all its potential customers in the second half of
the 1990s.
In spite of indigenous North Sea gas reserves exceeding two trillion cubic
metres, the problem of meeting demand has arisen from the lack of a national
gas export strategy.
Only two years ago, Norway was concerned that it might be unable to increase
gas sales and that its oil-dependent economy would suffer as declining oil
production cut sales revenue. Norway, one of Europe's largest gas producers,
is also the region's biggest oil producer, apart from Britain.
Earlier pessimism over the possibility of expanding gas markets has been
transformed into optimism by a 'green wave' sweeping Europe in which gas is
considered a more environmentally friendly fuel than oil in power
generation.
Gas sales in recent years have been in the range of 25bn cubic metres (bcm)
but this could double by the turn of the century.
Europe's rising gas demand is also being spurred by increasing technical
problems in the Soviet Union, Europe's biggest supplier, over boosting
exports.
Under the Troll/Sleipner gas sales agreement signed in 1986 between Norway
and a consortium of European buyers, 30.51 bcm is committed under the
contracts. The Troll and Sleipner East fields have reserves of just 26.5
bcm.
To help to fill the shortfall, the owners of the Troll field have agreed to
sell an additional 3.7 bcm from two other fields - the Veslefrikk and Brage
 -on behalf of those fields' owners.
The Troll field owners will charge these owners a handling fee. This
agreement forms a model for a 'brokerage' operation for other gas fields to
be taken under the Troll umbrella. However, not all owners want to sell
their gas through the Troll field owners but instead wish to make their own
sales deals.
Norway's supply quandary is complicated by gas purchase options contained
within the Troll agreement which could boost the buyers' total demand to
40.82 bcm. But before the buyers exercise their purchase options Norway must
guarantee it can meet this demand.

FT  15 APR 91 / Sterling and the fund managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight, the events of last Friday make both the chancellor and his
critics look pretty silly. Interest rates were cut again and sterling rose
again within the ERM.
This makes apparent nonsense of the dire warning from the six monetarist
letter-writers to The Times, who said that sterling would have to be
devalued to make interest rate cuts possible (MLR was then at 14 per cent).
However, the chancellor's sober warning that future cuts would depend on the
ERM looks equally pessimistic. Sterling has risen ever since he started
cutting rates, just as the dollar rose, seemingly without end, in the
mid-80s when rates were cut.
Can we conclude, then, that the economists are wrong and have the
relationship between interest rates and exchange rates upside down? Only up
to a point. We need only look south across Europe and see that the Spanish
peseta and the Italian lira are so strong on the basis of high rates that
only massive intervention can keep them within their ERM bounds.
Equally, look back a few months to the run-up to sterling's ERM entry: the
exchange rate against the ERM rose as interest rates were pushed up.
Meanwhile, however, the D-Mark is weak despite the expectation of higher
rates. All most confusing.
Some of the confusion may melt away if we remember the one clearly sensible
assertion of the once-fashionable rational expectation hypothesis: that
markets move only in response to surprises. (The rest of the theory is
largely forgotten, because nobody regards today's volatile markets as
rational.)
The rate cut in London last week was no surprise at all: the market had been
talking of little else for days, and so lower rates were clearly discounted
in the exchange markets, just as they were in the futures market. It is
perfectly possible, indeed, that the sterling rally reflected relief that
the politically-pressed government had not cut by a full point, which would
put the relationship the 'right' way up again.
There is an alternative theory, however, which is equally persuasive - and
equally impossible to prove. This would offend John of Occam, the schoolman
who said that one phenomenon could only have one cause; but in the markets,
things are not so rigorous. This rests on the distinction between 'hot'
money and long-term investment funds.
Footloose money simply seeks the highest rates of return, if the risk looks
acceptable; the higher the money market rate, the bigger the inflow. It was
a movement of this kind that financed the peak British current account
deficits and the large investment outflows of last year; and the rise in
Spanish and Italian reserves despite large deficits looks like the same
story.
Long-term investors, by contrast, look for expected real returns in the long
term. When they are dominant, exchange rates behave like equity prices: they
rise on lower credit costs, or the expectation of them. That, broadly, is
the British and American story for most of this year.
This does not mean that international investors are constantly losing sleep
over the cost of credit in London: the investors who make the weather are
mainly those based at home. It is because fund managers like UK equity
returns, especially with ERM insurance against exchange rate risks, that the
market moves as it does. And where else can you get a government-guaranteed
real return of 4 per cent? Answer: invest at home.
Other things being equal, this suggests that there is one rule for countries
with large and liquid equity markets and no exchange controls  - Japan, the
US and the UK, in that order. This, indeed, seems broadly to be the case.
The yen the dollar and sterling tend to move in the same direction as equity
markets; most other currencies respond more to relative interest rates,
especially where foreign investment is unfamiliar or hampered by law. This
simple insight might have prevented some of the more spectacular recent
mistakes in judging exchange rate and interest rate futures; but it is still
terribly over-simplified.
First, the relationship can break down when the market appears to doubt the
judgment of the monetary authorities; in other words, when the yield curve
steepens. It is now particularly steep in Wall Street; and it is probably
this fact, rather than the known prejudices of some regional Fed presidents
left over from the Volcker era, which restrained the Fed last week from
responding to lower inflation with a further rate cut.
This is a warning that investors may before long conclude that they are
safer in Japan, where the next interest rate move must surely be down,
rather than in the US, where it just could be up. It is also a longer-term
warning for sterling: if investors start to concentrate on the core rate of
inflation rather than the headline numbers, they could lose their present
confidence - especially after an autumn election. There is a longer-term
danger, too: where prices are based on expectations rather than on current
returns, they tend to overshoot once any move is established, as every
schoolboy must know by now. The dollar and the yen, both sharply undervalued
in purchasing power terms at the moment, clearly have a long way to rise:
equally clearly, they will rise too far. Sterling is or will be over-valued;
but its volatility will be limited by ERM membership - though not
eliminated: it could drag the whole system up for a time.
Furthermore, exchange rate movements have what may appear to investors a
perverse result: the exchange rate strength which results from the hope of
high returns tends in fact to reduce those returns. In fact, this is not
perverse at all: the market is simply doing its job of equalising expected
returns, partly through asset prices, and partly through competitive
pressures. It all adds, though, to the hangover when the market does
overshoot.
This is only the merest sketch of the true complexities of the
credit-exchange rate nexus: we should also factor in perceived financial
fragility, politics and demography, for a start. Is it any wonder that the
forecasters make such a hash of it?

FT  15 APR 91 / Letter: Retrospective changes to pensions not practical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER STIRRUP.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your editorial 'Sex and the over 60s' (March 28) you accurately
describe the quagmire in which occupational pension schemes find themselves
following the Barber judgment of the European Court of Justice in May 1990
and the recent decision of an industrial tribunal in favour of Mr Alan
Roscoe.
A key problem is the failure to recognise the essential feature of the UK
system, whereby occupational pensions are generally earned and paid for
during an employee's service.
Making retrospective changes to pensions already earned would mean varying
the terms of employment long after the service has been rendered, which is
not a practical proposition.
The National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) is keen that equality in
occupational and state pensions should be achieved as soon as possible. On
the other hand it believes that equality should not be applied compulsorily
to pensions which had already been earned before the Barber judgment and
which employers reasonably believed had been paid for.
Such a move could cause serious problems for the business of employers who
provide company pensions and so threaten the existence of their pension
schemes.
Employers do not have to provide pension schemes for their employees.
Many have decided to do so and as a result they have accepted extra costs.
It would penalise them unreasonably for that decision if they were now
burdened with even more costs.
Equality can be achieved without compulsion. In our recent survey covering
more than 830 major schemes run by NAPF members, we found that more than
half of them had already equalised. This trend would be accelerated if, as
we have repeatedly urged, the government equalised state pension ages.

FT  15 APR 91 / No European defence identity without Nato
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOUGLAS HURD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Defence is being dragged into the discussions about European union. Jacques
Delors, president of the European Commission, and others have proposed in
recent weeks that the European Community should have its own defence policy.
There is a creeping belief that the debate on a common foreign and security
policy is empty unless it extends to include defence. A foreign policy
without a military element is a policy of gestures, runs the argument.
Advocates of change in Europe's defence must answer the question: 'Why not
Nato?' For 40 years Nato has provided the peace in which we Europeans have
built our prosperity and political unity. We have had these benefits
cheaply. We Europeans provided much of the perseverance and the men. Our
American partners provided much of the money and the nuclear guarantee which
made Europe's defence credible.
Stability was - and is - Nato's gift to western Europe, a stable environment
in which to make adventurous political and business choices. In the east,
instability is now the greatest threat. In managing their transition to new
political arrangements, East as well as west needs Nato. The east Europeans
tell us that Nato continues to underpin the stability of the whole
continent.
We should not be tempted into tossing Nato aside casually, just because the
east Europeans have forcefully thrown away the Warsaw Pact. We need Nato. It
is tried by the west Europeans; it is trusted by the Americans; it is
respected by the east Europeans.
But Europe has changed for the better, and Nato must match those changes.
Nato needs a stronger European input. The 12 are making progress towards
European union and Europe is seeking a bigger role through a common foreign
and security policy. Europeans now realise that their security is affected
by problems beyond Europe, in neighbouring areas like the Middle East, not
just by adversaries within Europe.
America has reviewed its global strategy in the light of Soviet withdrawal
and is making reductions in its ground forces stationed in Europe. Both the
US and Europe recognise the continued need for Nato. The question is how a
stronger European input should be developed and how it should relate to
collective defence in Nato?
This is the nub of three inter-locking debates: in the European Community's
inter-governmental conference, the Western European Union and the Nato
strategy review. Parallel progress must be made. The prize is a new
arrangement to bring together the European union and the renewed Atlantic
alliance to guarantee a strong political partnership and maintain as
effective a collective defence as we have had in the past.
There is a case for a stronger European defence identity. Defence
consciousness among Europeans is a good thing; and it is time a more mature
and affluent Europe not only made its voice heard but also pulled its weight
in the alliance and western defence.
Our approach in the inter-governmental conference is to say: 'Let us be
European but let us not be arrogant or unrealistic.' Nato must be an
integral part of the future defence of Europe. It provides irreplaceable
elements in our security, not just for the time being but permanently. We
need to work out in detail how the alliance, the European input and European
union will be linked.
Inter-dependence, not exclusivity, is the key. An approach which emphasised
the separateness of Europe would seriously weaken our real security. The
argument that Europe must be united and sovereign, that structures should be
created to bring that about, is seductive - at first sight. But, in defence,
is the ultimate goal of a European union standing by itself what we really
want or need?
In defence, it does not follow that binding procedures designed to enforce a
common policy would make us react more effectively. Where would the European
military contribution to the Gulf crisis have been if formal voting
procedures had been required?
Defence involves supreme national interests unsuited to the hazards of
majority voting; national freedom of action is still important. The
Community already has one neutral member and may have others in future. Nato
has been successful in providing western defence. The US has been vital to
Nato's success; the EC cannot hope to maintain such a strong link. All these
limits on a Community role still hold true.
Moreover, the sovereignty of the 12 is not absolute in defence. The
transatlantic community will continue to be important to us, whether we like
it or not. The 12 could not guarantee its own security in a continent which
includes a military superpower in the form of the Soviet Union. The costs of
self-sufficiency in Europe would be astronomic. We could not acquire
satellites, heavy-lift capability and the rest of the necessary high-tech
paraphernalia overnight.
Despite the force of all these arguments, some claim there is a need to
build up the European defence identity because the US might withdraw. I see
no evidence of a US wish to disengage. But the surest way to bring that
about would be for Europeans to treat Nato as an alliance of last resort
while shifting their effort elsewhere.
Practicality and principle will have to be reconciled in the end. Britain's
proposals show a way forward.
We agree that the construction of an integrated Europe must include security
and defence. But European defence without the United States does not make
sense. The common foreign and security policy should include some broad
security issues (Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, arms
control and non-proliferation, for example) but it should not compete with
the military tasks in Nato.
A mechanism to ensure co-ordination between common foreign and security
policy and Nato will be crucial. The Western European Union is in our view
the answer most likely for European co-ordination within the alliance and as
the defence arm of the union. This re-invigorated WEU would need an
operational capability. It would be complementary to Nato. It would give
Europe both more influence within Nato and the capacity to respond with the
US to world events.
The WEU helped to co-ordinate European forces in the Gulf. It is now helping
to get humanitarian aid to the Kurdish refugees. We could build on the WEU's
experience in the Gulf when looking at how a European military role could be
further developed. A European Rapid Reaction Force for use outside the Nato
area would be logical and compatible with Nato's responsibilities to defend
Nato territory. In practice WEU forces and staffs will inevitably be drawn
from units and personnel also assigned to Nato roles. They could come under
either Nato or WEU commands, depending on the contingency with which they
were dealing.
Nato's own force and command structures will need to be adapted to reflect a
greater European voice and input. With fewer total resources the case for
integration is stronger than ever.
In the new Europe, with Nato linked via the WEU to the defence of the union,
I see no reason why all allies should not be equally and fully involved. I
would like to see our French and Spanish friends engaged in renovating the
alliance's structure and command arrangements.
Renewing the alliance and deciding how European defence should be
strengthened are two of our most important tasks in 1991 - they are two
sides of the same coin. Britain has put forward many ideas which are both
constructive and realistic. It is vital for the future safe defence of our
continent that we get the outcome right.

Sir, Can I assure Mr Addison ('NEDC conclusion is not the answer to

Council traffic management systems working party, has indeed taken on board
his suggestion for improving London's traffic flow.
Our final report will include road layout factors as well as enforcement
issues, public transport, the use of technology and economic factors. The
last will cover, among many others, the possible taxation of the provision
of a company-provided car parking space.
The last Budget introduced the taxation of a company-provided car telephone,
so why not a company-provided car parking space?
Finally, I don't know if the NEDC is 'the originator of the largest number

cases our target audience is not government but companies, that do act on
them.

<TEXT>
Sir, While it may be true that a leading company such as Guinness could
suffer negative public relations if it did not sign up to the proposed
voluntary 'green' audit scheme, while Carlsberg did, ('Industrial controls
must back greening incentives', Letters April 11), this would not be true,
or even important, for the two-thirds of companies which are not important
in commercial or industrial markets.
The public may therefore be entitled to remain sceptical of the voluntary
environmental charter which was recently launched by the International
Chamber of Commerce ('Leading companies in green pledge', April 11).
If industry is to be believed about both wanting to 'green up' its act and
to achieve the kind of 'level playing field' that Josiah Wedgwood wanted
when he asked government to extend the Factories Act from textiles to
potteries, then it should support our call for a mandatory environmental
auditing scheme.

FT  15 APR 91 / Now for the great UK inflation crossover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What would a physician say about an instrument which emitted symptoms of
heart failure while he was administering successful treatment, but gave
false reassurance if he stopped too early and endangered the patient's
health? Such is the UK Retail Prices Index - which rose to alarming levels
when interest rates were being raised to control inflation, but which would
for a period show near-zero price increases if the chancellor took risks
with inflation and reduced interest rates too far and too fast.
The worst unfavourable distortions were last autumn when headline inflation
of 10.9 per cent was three percentage points above the underlying rate. Even
the March figure is distorted upwards.
But the April RPI will show the start of a dramatic reversal, when the
figures will unduly flatter both the inflation rate and the government - as
I am sure the chancellor, Norman Lamont, will point out, even if the
Conservative chairman, Chris Patten does not. The Treasury has already
forecast a headline April inflation rate of barely more than 6 per cent,
although the underlying rate will still be 7 per cent.
The pro-Tory distortions will then become more dramatic. Goldman Sachs
projects a headline inflation rate of 4.7 per cent in June and one of as
little as 3 per cent in October. The underlying rate will also be falling,
but much less dramatically to, say, 5 1/2 per cent. The projections assume
10 1/2 per cent base rates by winter.
Obviously, 1992 is more tentative. But Goldman Sachs's best guess is that
the underlying inflation rate will continue to fall gradually to reach about
5 per cent by June 1992, the last date for a general election, and then
continue further towards 4 per cent by the end of the year. On the other
hand, the headline rate will bounce up and down between around 3 and 4 3/4
per cent as shown in the chart.
There are several reasons for seeking out an underlying or 'core' inflation
rate. The RPI inflation, because of its distorted treatment of housing. The
best pure inflation measure is probably that of the Institute for Fiscal
Studies, which excludes mortgage interest and the Community Charge, but
brings in house prices indirectly. Even that index still has the defect of
including random and erratic fluctuations, which would still be there if the
inflation trend were zero, and which policy could never hope to eliminate.
Smoothing out these vagaries can never be a mechanical operation. The
nearest to an ideal index, if we could have it accurately and on time, has
the off-putting title of 'GDP deflator at factor cost'. But the deflator has
the great disadvantage of appearing only once a quarter, two or three months
late, and is often revised.
So we are driven back on to adjusted versions of the RPI. But if the
underlying rate which the Treasury has preferred to date - the RPI excluding
mortgage interest and the poll tax - were followed, this could show a large
inflation jump to 8 3/4 per cent in April because of the 2 1/2 percentage
point Budget increase in VAT. The Goldman Sachs index in the chart excludes
mortgages, poll tax, VAT and petrol.
* * *
Although sterling's position in the ERM allows further interest rate
reductions, it certainly does not require them. Friday's half percentage
point fall in UK base rates to 12 per cent is the last that can be justified
as part of the return journey from the abnormally high rate of 15 per cent.
In seven out of the past 12 years three month rates averaged more than 12
per cent.
Further reductions need to be justified to the hilt by underlying inflation
pressures as well as by recession fears. The fact that the Civil Service
unions can even contemplate rejecting a pay offer of nearly 8 per cent -
itself related to private sector settlements - shows how far inflationary
psychology is from being eradicated. Any idea that base rates should move
automatically down with the year-on-year headline Retail Prices Index would
be a recipe for disaster. Although the Bank of England is not yet
independently accountable, it would find ways of making the fact known if it
were forced into rate cuts against its better judgment.

FT  15 APR 91 / Letter: Fast action by clearing banks could save many ailing
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEREMY PARKER.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It comes as little surprise to read in the letter from Messrs Smith and
Barnes (April 2) that the company in their study failed, despite the
presence of a number of professional advisers.
Our recent experience of working with small companies in financial
difficulty is that management is wholly preoccupied with survival and has
neither the time to consult its advisers nor the inclination to worsen its
creditor position by so doing. Few small companies can afford full-time
professional management, yet such skills are essential to their survival. It
is improbable that a company's auditors or its solicitors, let alone its
bankers, should be able to provide the level of hands-on management resource
that is called for when it is ailing.
One solution available to shareholders and directors seeking to buy time
from creditors is to appoint a part-time director with the appropriate
experience in managing corporate restructuring and refinancing. The
appearance of a seasoned professional at the helm of a troubled ship has
been known to calm the nerves of lenders and creditors alike.
The number of failures in the small company sector could be reduced if the
clearing banks reacted sooner to their clients' difficulties: it is too
often the case that by the time the bank calls in investigating accountants,
the company is beyond rescue and the accountants' fee is the final nail in
the corporate coffin.
The banks' early warning systems should be able to detect the first signs of
decline in the quality of their security and it is then that they should
take action, bearing in mind the potentially fatal time-lag which occurs
between the processing of management information and the actual state of the
company's solvency.
Lacking the resources internally to help smaller companies, the banks should
be in a position to draw on a pool of experienced company doctors whom they
can 'recommend' to their clients. Early diagnosis and treatment of an ailing
company by a part-time external director introduced by the banks or
shareholders has a better chance of effecting a long-term cure than
occasional advice and surveillance by auditors and accountants. Jeremy

FT  15 APR 91 / Leading Article: Europe's real challenge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HEADS of state are descending on London by the bus-load today for the
inauguration of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. More
than a year after the idea took firm shape, it is still not clear whether
the institution they are coming to cheer is one that will make a useful, if
modest, contribution to the redevelopment of central and eastern Europe - or
whether it will prove to be a diversion.
Look on the positive side first. The bank will be deploying the bulk of its
10bn Ecu capital in the private sector - acting as a catalyst for other
investors, helping to put entrepreneurial zip into small business and to
create a badly-needed service sector in economies which tend to be dominated
by old line manufacturing.
The job will be tricky, given that private sector lenders from the west are
already trawling the region in the search for profitable opportunities. But
the EBRD could turn into a centre of specialist expertise, collecting under
one roof the wide range of skills that will be needed to tackle the immense
task in hand.
Management and technological assistance are just as badly needed as
financial muscle, so the new bank's limited capital resources need not be a
great handicap. And its private sector bias will help to distinguish its
role from other institutions such as the World Bank, which already has very
big infrastructure programmes under way. At the same time, the EBRD is
making sensible noises about the need to proceed with caution, and to
preserve at all costs a top credit rating.
Political mandate
One unique, and potentially valuable, feature of the bank is its political
mandate. Its customers must be committed to promoting democracy and market
economies. Again, it is easy to imagine all kinds of complications, but an
institution of this kind could find it easier to make its views felt than
would be possible in dealings at government level. The EBRD will also have
an important lobbying role in the other direction, forcing the European
Community and governments to turn their rhetoric into practical measures of
assistance.
But this is where the worries start. There is a risk that the EBRD has too
grand a vision of its future role in Europe. And there is an even bigger
risk that European governments will seize on this as an excuse to avoid the
tougher and more important policy initiatives that are urgently required.
Specific initiatives
In an interview on page 30 of today's issue, the bank's dynamic president,
Mr Jacques Attali, talks at length about his ideas. He sees the bank as the
first pan-European institution, and cites the precedent of the European Coal
and Steel Community as an example of how relatively specific initiatives can
be a means to achieving much bigger political goals.
Only time will tell what this actually means, and whether such visions can
be reconciled with the practical and sometimes tedious business of helping a
widget plant to improve its quality control, or a company of software
designers to find the right markets. But at the moment, he sometimes sounds
as though he cannot see the trees for the wood.
Meanwhile, European governments face much bigger challenges than those which
can be tackled by the EBRD. Agriculture, textiles and steel account for more
than 50 per cent of Poland's exports to the EC. Unless it can have free
access to the markets of the west, it has little chance of developing a
sound market economy.
At the moment, the omens are not good. Far from lowering its barriers to the
east, the Community is actually dumping agricultural commodities, so
undermining their comparative advantage. For their part, some east Europeans
are not moving fast enough to develop the legislative structures for
attracting foreign investment.
So the heads of state gathered in London should spend the first five minutes
of the day toasting the birth of an energetic and potentially useful
institution. The rest of the time should be given over to a much more
difficult and important debate. There is a unique opportunity to reshape
continental Europe: it will not recur.

FT  15 APR 91 / Arts: Asylmuratova - Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Friday night, Altynai Asylmuratova made her debut in A Month in the
Country. From our first sight of this Natalya Petrovna, leaning back on the
chaise longue, divinely beautiful and fatally bored, the ballet was hers.
There was such psychic concentration and such discreet power to her
movement, that the course of this summer tragedy was inevitable, and
inevitably touching.
What Asylmuratova brings to ballet is grandeur of scale. Not that she
distorts or exaggerates her roles, but the force of her presence and of her
beauty, the broad horizons of her Kirov schooling, so increase the
choreography's impact that her characterisations gain an extreme intensity.
Yet nothing is disproportionate. Ashton's dances for Natalya, often a
filigree of quick steps, are as lightly done as one could wish, and with
what native authority does Asylmuratova seize upon those Polish dance
attitudes with which Ashton responds to Chopin - the proud epaulement and
bold gestures have a fiery rhythm and grace. Musical and physical nuance are
matched with no less sensitive playing of the drama. The flare of temper
when she finds her ward, Vera, in Belyayev's arms; Natalya's own
uncertainties as she yields to him, are done, like everything else, with a
complete naturalness and a complete understanding of Ashtonian manner. She
speaks his language with lovely ease - both in the brief dialogues with
Rakitin and her husband, and in the final eddying surrender to Belyayev.
The incandescence of Asylmuratova's style, and of her interpretation,
persuades us of the seriousness of this summer flirtation. She re-creates
Turgenyev's world. Her magic also invites a vivid response from her
colleagues - Derek Rencher's Rakitin seems even more devoted, Fiona
Brockway's Vera more pathetic. Bruce Sansom repeats his decently youthful
view of Belyayev - but one wonders what this Natalya sees in him.
Friday night's Requiem, ending a fine triple bill, benefited from Viviana
Durante's innocence in the Pie Jesu, and from Michael Nunn's simplicity in
the Offertoire. MacMillan's choreography is as consolatory as Faure's music,
and as potent.

FT  15 APR 91 / Arts: The Winter's Tale - Aldwych Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After commenting unfavourably earlier this week on the English Shakespeare
Company's transformation of Coriolanus to eastern Europe, it is pleasant to
be able to report that the same company has come up with a thoroughly
enjoyable production of The Winter's Tale.
It is not until at least half way through that a deliberate act of
perversity takes place. Antigonus, having deposited the infant Perdita in
the wilderness, does not, as in the Shakespeare text, 'exit pursued by a
bear'. Instead he is killed by Leontes, who makes an unscripted appearance.
Not that the bear episode is the best of Shakespeare's inventions; it is odd
to replace it with the killing by a king who is already a penitent after
realising he has falsely accused his wife. This, however, is director
Michael Bognadov's only aberration. For the rest he sticks to the play,
which is precisely its title: a very good winter's tale that ends in spring.
Seeing the two productions within a day or two of each provides a chance to
assess the strengths of the company. It is strong enough not to need wild
ideas to show off. Michael Pennington is a far better Leontes than he is
Coriolanus. He speaks the verse clearly and altogether looks more at home in
a dinner jacket than dirty jeans. Some of this style might yet be put into
his Coriolanus.
One of the best-looking players in Coriolanus was Lynn Farleigh as Virgilia.
As 'my gracious silence', she had very little to say. As Hermione in The
Winter's Tale, she looks good and speaks well. And as we noticed with her
Virgilia, she is stunning at standing still. The final scene where her
statue comes to life is played with immense presence because the whole cast
behaves with discipline.
The piece inevitably and deliberately falls into two parts: the first where
Leontes is consumed with jealousy, the second where the rustics begin to
take over. Part one is played with the intensity that one would expect from
this company, though not without subtlety. Leontes, for instance, gives some
facial indication of his suspicions even before he voices them. Part two
brings out some unsuspected comic depths in the playing.
Autolycus (James Hayes) is an unusually elderly Irishman. When Polixenes and
Camillo put on their disguises, they choose some wonderful old tweeds and
plus-fours. It is hard to recognise this Polixenes as Andrew Jarvis who
plays Aufidius in Coriolanus. Clearly he has more talents than one realised.
Robert Demeger stands out in both productions as one of the tribunes in
Coriolanus and Camillo in The Winter's Tale. He could probably play most of
the other parts as well.

FT  15 APR 91 / Economics: On guard for German rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE is awash with economic news this week. The markets are on guard for
an interest rate rise in Germany - the Bundesbank meets on Thursday.
It would be difficult to overestimate the German authorities' commitment to
price stability, so there is speculation that the bank will raise rates to
counteract the recent weakness in the DM and quell rising inflationary
pressures.
This is viewed as more likely after the bank tightened money market
conditions last week and the current account data, which revealed the extent
to which reunification has depressed exports and sucked in imports.
In the UK, the producer price data tomorrow will be keenly dissected for
evidence that subdued demand and trading conditions are restraining
inflation at the factory gate. This series has recently indicated that
manufacturers are still trying to pass on high unit wage costs in higher
prices.
With the pound weak against the dollar, there is the additional risk that
the UK is importing higher inflation - adding an estimated 1 percentage
points on input prices.
US inflation, on the other hand, seem much improved after last week's
consumer price data. With the strong dollar, better current account data and
encouraging noises from the Fed, even recessionary data on housing starts
today should not damp hopes of a modest US recovery.
Thursday's wodge of statistics should reveal the latest state of the public
sector finances. With a borrowing requirement of around Pounds 2bn pencilled
in, this suggests a debt repayment for the financial year of Pounds 1.7bn.
Also of great interest to the gilts market will be the money supply data,
which are due to show M4 lending slipping after a slackening in takeover
activity in March.
Other events and statistics with median market forecasts from MMS
International, the financial services company, in brackets include:
Today: Japan, corporate bankruptcies for March, wholesale price index (0.9
per cent) for March, trade balance customs basis for March. Germany,
wholesale prices for March. UK, informal G7 meeting.
Tomorrow: US, housing starts, building permits, industrial production and
capacity utilisation for March. UK, producer prices for March (input down
2.5 per cent, output 6.3 per cent). Japan, final production indices for
February. France, preliminary consumer price index for March 93.8 per cent).
Wednesday: UK, public sector borrowing requirement for March (2.5bn).
Thursday: UK, unemployment (75,000), average earnings (9.5 per cent),
manufacturing unit wage costs (11.1 per cent), industrial production (0.5
per cent) for February, vehicle production for March, fourth quarter
institutional investment. France, industrial production for March (down 1.3
per cent). Germany, Bundesbank meeting, producer prices for March,
manufacturing hourly earnings for February. US, merchandise imports and
exports for February, money supply data for April.
Friday: UK, money supply data M0 (2.7 per cent) and M4 (10.2 per cent) M4
lending Pounds 4bn). US, merchandise trade for February. France, money
supply data for March.

Results due
THIS week sees yet more results from construction and building materials
companies. Attention will focus not so much on profit falls but whether any
more rights issues appear.
Average forecasts for Blue Circle, due on Thursday, suggest pre-tax profits
of about Pounds 195m last year compared to Pounds 231.8m in 1989.
Higgs &amp; Hill is expected to report between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m (Pounds
26.5m) on Wednesday, barring increased provisions on commercial and
residential property.
Trusthouse Forte, the leisure group, is expected to report a 20 per cent
drop in pre-tax profits to around Pounds 210m (Pounds 260m) for the year to
end-January on Thursday.
However, much of the fall will reflect lower profits on property sales of
perhaps Pounds 10m compared to Pounds 45m.
Lep, the freight forwarding and security company reporting 1990 results on
Thursday, must regret that Mr Michael Ashcroft's ADT, now the subject of a
lawsuit from the Canadian company Laidlaw, holds 27 per cent of its shares.
The market will not take much notice of its profits while that drama hangs
over the stake. Nevertheless, analysts expect Lep to report a rise in
pre-tax profits to about Pounds 33m (Pounds 26.5m).
Interim results to the end of February from Albert Fisher, the acquisitive
fresh food distributor, also due on Thursday, are expected to show Pounds
44m pre-tax (Pounds 19.9m).
Much of the improvement will come from interest receivable.
Of more concern to the market are questions over the sudden departure of Mr
Keith Brackpool, the head of the US business.

FT  15 APR 91 / Letter: System has potential to transform the way we live
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD GRAHAM.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article on road congestion, Richard Tomkins implies that
restraining road usage is necessary just because paralysis is imminent. The
real problem with car ownership is that nobody wants to apply economic
principles to it.
There is a glut of road usage in some parts of the system and there soon
will be in others. Economics teaches us that therefore the price is too low.
The pricing system for all transport is fundamentally tilted in favour of
road transport in general and private road transport in particular. The only
way to restore the situation is to charge a realistic price for the roads at
the point of use. Modern electronic road pricing does just that.
The first move should be on all toll crossings. Every user fitting such a
device would not only get through the Dartford tunnel quicker, there could
also be a discount.
Next it could be used to collect car-park charges both off and on street. It
could also be used to pay parking fines - even towing charges. The idea
would be to find lots of uses giving the motorist the benefit of convenience
and saved time before extending pricing. It could next be used on crowded
motorways and in congested cities.
All this would develop confidence in the system and gain wide acceptance.
Not spending massive sums on car ownership would release immense funds for
other uses.
The benefits in time-saving, safety and environment would be felt throughout
society. Electronic road pricing has the potential to transform the way we
live. Its implementation is only a matter of time.

FT  15 APR 91 / Letter: Night deliveries could bolster company margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN E. THOMPSON.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The prospect of road prices, as represented in Richard Tomkins'
article, presents an evil spectre to a transport industry already dogged by
fuel and VAT increases.
Often cited as an indicator of the state of the UK economy as a whole, the
fact that many of the industry's stalwarts (such as John Dee Group, Rockwood
and Hunter Distribution ) have gone to the wall, gives something of an
impression of the state of the market.
The cost to the economy of congestion, cited by the Confederation of British
Industry, must be compared to the costs of road pricing which, in the case
of commercial concerns, will inevitably be passed on to their customers and,
in turn, their consumers. My guess is the road pricing will certainly be no
cheaper - even if, as seems likely, its responsibility is hoisted on to the
private sector.
It is true that the era in which traffic growth can be accommodated by
conventional means is coming to an end. Roads in Britain are fast becoming a
finite resource. A more imaginative use of the resource, therefore, is
surely the key.
Lynx has actively encouraged its customers to adopt night-time deliveries.
Although such a measure has been slow to take root, we are hoping it will
gradually gain acceptance - particularly in the retailing and manufacturing
sectors, where margins are equally under pressure.
Widespread acceptance of such initiatives is in the greater interests of the
UK economy. Forcing commercial concerns off the roads is not.

FT  15 APR 91 / Management: The unkindest cut of all - The head office
conundrum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few company announcements, short of a set of glowing profits, attract so
much approval from shareholders, employees and the media as declarations of
intent to slash the size and cost of corporate headquarters.
Yet few actually generate so little real action.
Take three large corporations which, over the past decade, have been seen as
management models: General Electric of the US, British Petroleum, and ICI.
They may be models in other respects, but only one of the trio, GE, ended
the 1980s with the really lean head office to which its chairman had
supposedly dedicated himself at the start of the decade. The other two left
much or all of the job to their successors; at BP, action was taken a year
ago, while ICI made another declaration of slimming intent only in February.
Back in 1982, when ICI was (as now) hit hard by recession, the incoming
chairman, Sir John Harvey-Jones, set out to cut its head office staff from
about 1,200 to around 150. But he managed to slim it only as far as 400 or
so in London, with several hundred more re-located elsewhere. The central
core has since edged up to 500, with another 480 on other sites, in and
around London.
In the same year, amid a veritable flood of supposedly swingeing head-office
cost-cutting from other UK companies, the new chairman of BP, Sir Peter
Walters, declared his intention to cut his head office from its 2,000-plus
level. By the end of his tenure in 1990, BP's head office was 2,200. It took
the new chairman, Robert Horton, to wield the necessary axe last year, and
get the core down below 400, though on the widest definition BP's head
office still employs almost 1,200 people.
Defining who does, and does not, work for a head office of a large company,
rather than for a division or 'business' beneath it, is difficult in these
days of advanced information technology and widespread job dispersal that
General Electric, despite its early successes, has given up talking about it
in public.
It may seem naive to wonder why most chairmen find it so hard to match brave
words with action so close to their own seats of power - and why, in
particular, it took ICI's Sir Denys Henderson, chairman after Harvey-Jones
since 1987, until February to herald a much-needed further cost-cutting
drive.
According to a senior executive at ICI, one reason is that its head office,
like most others, has always contained very powerful functional barons.
Unless the chairman of the day takes a very strong line towards them,
streamlining 'just won't happen'. ICI chairmen have declared their intention
to kick head office into shape, but only Harvey-Jones came anywhere close to
doing so.
Then there is the chairman's own style. It was all very well for Sir Peter
Walters to declare his intent to chop BP's headquarters sharply, but his
natural insistence on central control of most group activities meant that a
large head office staff was inevitable.
This degree of supervision was probably necessary in the early 1980s in
order to steer the transformation of BP's asset portfolio and to 'parent'
the group's inexperienced new divisions. But these 'second-guessing'
activities became increasingly redundant from the mid-1980s.
When Robert Horton virtually halved BP's corporate staff on taking office,
he also abolished about 70 of the head office committees which they served -
more than three-quarters of the total. He also began to introduce a much
more informal, and flexible, way of working. ICI, conversely has just been
forced by the under-performance of its divisions to introduce an extra
high-level control committee.
As BP's 'networking' approach works its way through the corporate system -
both at head office itself, and in relations with the group's constituent
businesses - its headquarters could shrink further. There could be added
pressure in this direction from the businesses, which want the group to be
clearer about the degree to which its headquarters contributes to
shareholder value.
Beyond personal and corporate style, the size of a company's head office is
influenced by some tricky structural factors. At BP, the traditionally
complex matrix organisation has been simplified drastically by giving
divisions (which BP calls 'business streams') primacy over geographic
regions.
Against the background of the new culture of openness and informality which
Horton is trying to establish, the result is that headquarters no longer has
to intervene constantly to iron out tensions between powerful divisional and
regional barons.
At ICI, by contrast, only in the past few months has a decision been taken
to relegate all 'geographic territories' to providing services to global
businesses, rather than sharing business decisions with them; the
consequences for head office staffing will not be decided until later this
year.
A further factor which influences the size of any large company's head
office is the extent to which a national corporate HQ is included within the
global headquarters. BP has moved further away from this than has ICI.
The fact that BP can now operate with a relatively small head office is also
due to the slimness of its portfolio - just three large businesses, and one
smallish one - and the fact that the inter-relationships between them are
relatively simple. GE, with over three times as many businesses,
nevertheless, has even fewer cross-business 'synergies' to manage.
ICI, in contrast, is a much more complex animal. The portfolio pruning which
it heralded last month may simplify things somewhat, but most types of
chemicals businesses are much more interconnected than are, say, BP's
exploration and nutrition divisions - and certainly more so than GE's
conglomerate-like portfolio of aero engines, household appliances, financial
services, TV stations, and so on.
To be fair to ICI, a small head office is not necessarily beautiful for
every type of company. Much depends on the 'parenting' requirements of
businesses in its portfolio.
One head office parenting role is right in some circumstances, but not in
others. Precisely the same goes for size. Just as most head offices are
probably still too large, and add more burden than value to the businesses
beneath them, some suffer from the opposite complaint.

FT  15 APR 91 / Letter: Inter-urban congestion can be eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD DIMENT.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have rather more confidence than Richard Tomkins ('Pile-up in the
great car economy', April 9) that the government's road improvement
programme will reduce traffic congestion.
While it is true that total route mileage will increase by about 2 per cent,
the improvement programme concentrates on providing extra capacity by
widening rather than lengthening the existing inter-urban road network.
Under the government's proposals for England, the capacity of the trunk road
network, which carries one-third of all traffic and two-thirds of goods
traffic, will grow by about 45 per cent.
This will involve improvement of about one-third of the existing network
estimated to be incapable of coping with forecast traffic at the turn of the
century. The remaining two-thirds of the trunk road system is estimated to
have adequate capacity to meet future demand to beyond the turn of the
century.
Provided the programme is fully implemented, we can meet inter-urban traffic
demand for the foreseeable future. Mr Tomkins' analysis becomes far more
relevant in urban areas where increases in capacity will be minimal but at
the same time traffic growth in those areas will be far lower. Nevertheless
urban problems could be eased if through traffic could be removed from towns
and villages on to bypasses.
Having removed through traffic from towns and villages, attention can be
turned to the local traffic. But it should not be assumed that it can simply
be catered for on an improved public transport system.
Evidence from Britain and western Europe shows that previous improvements in
public transport have mainly benefited existing users who find themselves
with a more convenient service. Those improvements have done little to
encourage drivers to leave their car at home. It may well then be necessary
to use a stick, perhaps road pricing, to encourage more use of public
transport in such areas.
But advocates of traffic restraint should be aware of a recent study in
Stockholm which concluded that the imposition of road pricing would result
in an 8 per cent reduction in city centre retail trade. How many towns and
cities would pay that price to reduce their traffic congestion?

FT  15 APR 91 / Letter: Trains offer scant hope for a non-car economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW BRAID.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I felt I had to reply to Richard Tomkins' article on the car economy,
and had ample time to compose this letter while sitting for 50 minutes on
the stationary 7.23 train to London.
I agree entirely that traffic in cities is becoming impossible but pricing
people off the road can never work without a widely available and reliable
alternative. As in other cities this will have to be the bus and
particularly the train system.
Unlike other European countries, Britain is the only one where people do not
catch the train to meet a fixed appointment time, and unless attitudes are
changed by a far better service - which will necessitate public investment
in the network - then there is little future for a non-car economy. I for
one am about to join the drivers to London, having finally given up on
British Rail's incompetence after a 90-minute delay getting to London and 20
minutes returning to Manchester, although I much prefer travelling by rail.

FT  15 APR 91 / Letter: An 'evil' that restores the right balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREA CASALOTTI.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I think it is perverse for you to say that road-pricing is the least of
all evils. As you rightly point out, at present motorists pay only a
fraction of the cost that society incurs because of their action.
Road-pricing would help restore the rightful balance. It is therefore a good
thing.
Following your logic, would the 55p price of the Financial Times also be an
evil?

FT  15 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Study shows mental health problems of
City dealers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY DEALERS working for US-owned financial institutions are likely to
suffer from poorer mental health and find their jobs less satisfying than
counterparts in more conservative UK companies, psychologists have found.
Results of the survey, carried out in 12 institutions with 200 dealers, were
presented to the annual conference of the British Psychological Society by
Dr Howard Kahn of Heriot-Watt University.
Female dealers were better able to cope with work-related stress, although
they experienced less job satisfaction. In spite of better academic
qualifications, women reported general discrimination and fewer promotion
opportunities.
More than 40 per cent of dealers questioned in an initial survey said they
drank heavily, compared with 8 per cent of other professionals.
Dr Kahn said: 'Though it appears that dealers are able to cope with the long
hours and pressures associated with their work, their high intake of alcohol
. . . the pattern of relaxation at and after work with colleagues, and the
lack of support outside work gives rise to concern.'

FT  15 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): TUC proposes role in product
improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OUR LABOUR EDITOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS were yesterday urged to make use of new management techniques in
order to establish a role in improving product quality. The call came in a
paper published by the TUC as part of the most fundamental review of its
role for a quarter of a century.
In the paper, which will be central to discussions among union leaders this
year, unions are advised to learn as much as possible about human resource
management (HRM) and total quality management (TQM) techniques in order to
gain from them.
An analysis of trade unionism in the 1990s by Lord McCarthy, a Fellow of
Nuffield College, Oxford, argues that although most workers are sceptical of
HRM, the techniques stem from managers' acceptance that people are not
merely another factor of production.
Lord McCarthy says that some overt attempts to improve involvement and
commitment 'turn out to be ways of loading (workers) with additional
responsibilities without appropriate changes of job description or
upgrading'. However, he says the increased awareness that working people are
the key to organisational efficiency can be seen 'as an opportunity to show
that unions can contribute constructively to the pursuit of total quality'.
He also says unions can make pay demands that reflect their members'
contribution to improved performance and lower unit costs. They may be
accompanied by 'more flexible and speedy procedures for resolving
outstanding differences'.

FT  15 APR 91 / Leeds may take tax proposals to European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEEDS PERMANENT Building Society may go to the European Court of Human
Rights to challenge Budget proposals to block repayment of Pounds 57m paid
in double taxation if it is unable to gain legal redress in the UK.
The society says it plans to press ahead with a High Court action against
the Inland Revenue, but its prospects appear to be slim because of
retrospective legislation announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in
the Budget.
Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive of Leeds, the UK's fifth-largest building
society, said Mr Lamont's claim in the Budget speech that he was correcting
a defect in the law to prevent building societies from enjoying a windfall
gain was an outrageous use of retrospective legislation to trample over the
rulings of the courts.
Mr Lamont was announcing rules to prevent societies from reclaiming Pounds
250m in double taxation paid in 1985 and 1986. Details will be published in
the Finance Bill on Wednesday.
Mr Blackburn last week wrote what are believed to have been strongly worded
letters to Mr Lamont and to Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Attorney General,
disputing the way in which the Inland Revenue has presented the affair.
The Chancellor's action followed a House of Lords victory for Woolwich
Building Society last October in a test case brought to establish the
societies' right to money paid to the Inland Revenue during the transitional
period in 1985-86 while composite rate tax was applied to building societies
for the first time.
The double taxation arose because the Inland Revenue made no allowance in
its transitional regulations for the societies whose financial years ended
in the autumn rather than coinciding with the tax year.
The Budget statement said building societies that brought actions after
Woolwich would not get their money back.
It was the second government attempt to introduce retrospective legislation
to do so. The first, in 1986, was defeated in the Lords because it was
incorrectly drafted.
Mr Blackburn said: 'The effect of the chancellor's proposal on the Leeds
Permanent would be to perpetuate the confiscation of a substantial sum of
money - Pounds 57m excluding interest since 1986 - that belongs to the
reserves of the society, which in turn belong to its members.'

FT  15 APR 91 / Publishing directors quit in row with parent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE managing and editorial directors of Mitchell Beazley, the specialist
publisher, have resigned in a row with its parent company Octopus Books,
part of Reed International.
The resignation of Mr Duncan Baird, managing director, and Mr Jack
Tressidor, editorial director, came after an insistence that Mitchell
Beazley give up its separate premises and move into the Octopus headquarters
in London.
Mitchell Beazley was one of the leading niche publishers of the 1970s and
1980s, famous for its Hugh Johnson books on wine and The Joy of Sex.
Mrs Janice Mitchell, widow of Mr James Mitchell, a co-founder, is expected
to resign as a non-executive director.
When Mrs Mitchell sold the publishing company to Paul Hamlyn's Octopus four
years ago - just before it in turn was taken over by Reed - undertakings
were given on both autonomy and an independent location.
When Mitchell Beazley moves to Octopus headquarters in Michelin House,
Fulham, redundancies are feared in areas such as sales which could be served
centrally.
Mitchell Beazley is believed to have pre-tax profits of about Pounds 900,000
on a turnover of Pounds 10m.
It is not clear whether the top-level resignations will endanger
relationships between the publisher and its authors.

FT  15 APR 91 / Rolls-Royce discusses Thai joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine maker, is in discussions to expand its capacity
in the Far East which may include a joint venture in Thailand to make
components for its products and supply the local market.
Senior officials of the company, including Sir Ralph Robins, the chief
executive, held talks in Thailand, Indonesia and Japan on a visit that ended
last Monday.
'We held initial talks in Thailand about the local manufacture of components
for our range of aerospace products,' Rolls-Royce confirmed yesterday. 'We
are interested in gaining new sources of manufacturing . . . But we are at a
very early stage of discussions.'
The company is still closely associated with the British engineering
industry, a legacy of its days as part of the group that also made
Rolls-Royce cars. The group was nationalised after going bankrupt in 1971.
The car division is now owned by Vickers, while the aerospace engines
division was privatised in 1987.
While a large percentage of the company's components are manufactured in
Britain, a significant proportion is sourced overseas, including some
high-technology elements such as turbine blades.
Rolls-Royce already has joint-venture arrangements with companies in
Australia, Spain, and Italy. It also signed one with a company in Indonesia
a year ago. Some of the joint ventures are equal partnerships, while others
involve smaller ownership stakes.
The Rolls-Royce executives also discussed possible future orders in Japan
and plans for engine production at the Indonesian plant during their visit.

FT  15 APR 91 / Balance of payments of the main industrial countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS and JILL LEYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR makers of international economic policy, one of the worries of the
second half of the 1980s was current account 'imbalances'. If these were,
indeed, a problem, a solution is on the way.
As the chart shows, current account deficits and surpluses are dwindling
away as a share of the gross national or domestic products of the four main
countries that have experienced the largest divergences from balance. But it
is too soon to be sure how far this change is structural and how far only
cyclical.
This adjustment is also clear from the table, the second in our new series
of world economic indicators. It presents balance of payments data,
denominated in Ecu, for each of the six largest industrialised countries,
though Germany's balance of payments refers only to the west in the period
before economic and monetary union.
Annual data are presented for the period 1984 to 1990, and both quarterly
and monthly for 1990 and early 1991. The quarterly and monthly data have
been adjusted to remove seasonal fluctuations, except where indicated in the
notes. This table will appear approximately every month, with the latest
available monthly, quarterly and annual data.
The most striking feature of the table is the conversion by means of the
Ecu, the European currency unit. The customary numeraire for currency
conversion has long been the US dollar, but it is the currency of only one
country, however large, and has been notoriously unstable against other
major currencies. Changes in dollar amounts over time can be a highly
misleading indicator of real developments.
It is desirable to use a more internationally representative unit of
account. There are two competitors, the International Monetary Fund's
Special Drawing Right and the Ecu. The former is the more global, but it is
merely a unit of account, while the Ecu is becoming a genuine currency. In
addition, since sterling joined the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System, four of the six countries shown above - Germany, France,
Italy and the UK - should have fairly stable exchange rates against the Ecu.
For those unfamiliar with the Ecu, the exchange rate for each country,
expressed as units of the national currency per Ecu, is also included in the
table. This allows the series to be converted back to national currencies.
The table presents the value of visible exports, the trade balance and the
current account for each country. The trade balance is equal to the value of
visible exports minus the value of visible imports. Imports can be
calculated by subtracting the value of exports from the trade balance.
The current account balance is equal to sum of the visible and invisible
trade balances. There are three main categories of invisible imports and
exports: services, such as banking; interest, profits and dividends; and
transfers, such as payments by the UK government to the EC or in overseas
aid.
Statistics for invisible trade are notoriously difficult to collect. For
example the UK estimates the invisible trade balance in compiling its
monthly data but records the actual data only every quarter. Monthly current
account data should, therefore, be treated with caution. The US does not
publish monthly data for invisible trade therefore current account data is
only available quarterly.
The effective exchange rate is a weighted average of the value of a currency
against a 'basket' of other currencies, expressed in index form. The weights
are designed to capture the relative importance of each of the other
countries as a competitor to the manufacturing sector of that country. These
series serve as an indicator of international competitiveness, correcting
for some of the volatility of daily exchange rate movements. The sharp fall
in the US effective exchange rate after 1985 reflects the depreciation of
the US dollar since that date.
Important differences between countries in the way they collect and report
trade statistics mean that cross-country comparisons must be made with
caution.
With the exception of the UK, the value of exports, imports and thus the
trade balance are shown on a customs clearance basis, reflecting the value
of goods as they pass through customs. UK data, by contrast, are expressed
on a balance of payments basis after a number of adjustments have been made
to the customs cleared data. These adjustments deduct freight costs and
insurance premiums from the import figures; and exclude certain types of
imports, for example UK-owned ships returning to the UK after repair abroad.
Import data from the US, Japan and France are published on a 'free on board'
(FOB) basis after deducting freight costs and insurance premiums. Imports
into Germany and Italy are published on a 'carriage, insurance and freight'
(CIF) basis. According to the IMF this causes imports to be 2-3 per cent
higher for Germany, and some 7 per cent higher for Italy.
A further cross-country discrepancy arises from the unusual way in which the
US current account is recorded. The US Commerce department includes capital
gains on US owned assets held abroad arising from changes in the value of
the dollar as an invisible item in the current account.
Regardless of all these complications, the message is clear: it is one of
balance of payments adjustment among these six countries.

FT  15 APR 91 / Somalia: a human disaster in the making - In the first of
two articles, Julian Ozanne reports on the civil war tearing the nation
apart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORN by tribal slaughter, revenge killings, and a looted capital city which
has degenerated into armed anarchy, Somalia has been deserted to its hapless
fate by the outside world.
Like the decomposed corpses which still litter Villa Somalia, the wrecked
former presidential palace of Mohammed Siad Barre, the life of a nation is
disintegrating.
Under the burning sun what was once human flesh has dried tight across the
skeletons into a hard translucent yellow leather. The smell of decomposition
has passed, replaced now with the reek of hundreds of pellets of rat faeces
which surround each body from head to toe.
The legacy of Barre's reign of terror carried out by his hated Red Beret
bodyguards lies not far away. Inside the Villa one of the president's
offices is knee-deep with thousands of unopened letters from human rights
activists across the world dating back to 1986, a testament of the contempt
in which the regime held those who questioned the way in which it held on to
power.
Perhaps not surprisingly no one has thought to give the reviled bodyguards a
dignified burial. There is neither the time nor the desire to do so in the
chaotic mayhem which has possessed a city marked by the constant clatter of
machine gun fire and warriors, many high on miraa, the local narcotic,
riding shotgun on cannibalised vehicles through a wasteland of pock-marked
buildings and streets strewn with debris.
As usual the victims are the civilians trapped without food, clean water or
basic medical supplies. In a Mogadishu hospital a young teenager lies in a
pool of blood on a concrete floor. His left arm and part of his face have
been blown away by a grenade he was playing with. His mother sits beside him
trying to put back the drip into his right arm which he keeps knocking out
as his body jerks with spasms of pain. 'He will die,' said one of the nuns
working in the SOS hospital, the only hospital which stayed functioning
during the worst of the war. Later that afternoon he died.
In what was once an SOS school, classrooms are flooded with babies born with
tetanus, emaciated infants with severe kwashiorkoor and marasmus, victims of
accidents and the wounded from the battle front. Without drugs, fuel, food
and foreign aid workers, the situation is deteriorating every day. A human
disaster is in the making.
Nearly three months after Mr Barre fled south from the capital with remnants
of his army, the civil war continues with unremitting intensity. Last week
forces allied to Mr Barre fought to within 20 miles of Mogadishu before
being beaten back.
But in the offices of the capital, the politicians still talk about peace.
'We are negotiating every day and we hope to fix a meeting between the two
warring parties soon,' said Mr Ali Mahdi Mohammed, the president of the
provisional United Somali Congress government. As he spoke the crackle of
machine gun fire erupted outside on the street.
For 21 years Mr Barre ruled Somalia favouring his own Marehan clan, a
sub-clan of the Darod, ruthlessly oppressing dissent. The Hawiye, the
overwhelming majority in Mogadishu, suffered most from Barre's myriad
security forces. Ninety-two were killed in three days after Christmas last
year, prompting an ethnic based uprising as Hawiye hunted down Darod and
Darod killed Hawiye.
'What begun as a power struggle turned into a tribal vendetta,' said Mr
Ahmed Haile, a supporter of the USC, under which the Hawiye are grouped.
'There is still a witch-hunt on both sides. Nobody can deny that. We are
ashamed about it.'
Most of the Darods fled south. The few remaining in the city had to take
shelter. In a stone-walled compound on the north of Mogadishu 3,200 of them
are camped in the home of Sheikh Abucar Omar Adan, a religious Hawiye leader
who has protected and fed the people his own clan were hunting down.
The provisional government is beginning to grapple with the problem, first
by acknowledging it. 'Clan is a reality in Africa and in all primitive
societies,' said President Ali Mahdi.' But I am sure we can overcome it.'
Among middle class Hawiye a consensus is emerging that a federal democratic
solution will be the only escape from clan rivalry, which has traditionally
been based on competition for land, waterholes and livestock.
'Clanism and tribalism cannot be buried. We must build a pluralist political
system where clan can be freely and fairly reflected as the political unit,'
said Mr Haile.
Whether deep inter-clan bitterness and revenge bloodlust can be diminished
remains questionable. Already 6,000-8,000 have died.
The seemingly abundant supply of weapons and ammunition provides the means.
In the gun market a Chinese made AK47 or German G3 rifle can be bought for
Dollars 110. Twenty bullets cost Dollars 1.20. Bazookas, rocket-propelled
grenades, machine guns, even tanks, are also available on special request.
The government says it is trying to police the city and buy back the guns at
market rates. But with an estimated 20,000 criminals on the loose and the
demands of fighting a civil war, the task is Herculean.
By day nobody dares drive around the city without gunmen pointing their guns
out of the back windows or riding on the roofs. At night the streets are
empty as intermittent gunfire breaks out and the sky is illuminated with red
tracer bullets.
So far there seems little prospect for an end to the killing.

<TEXT>
MR YITZHAK Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, who has come under pressure
from the US to help launch Middle East peace negotiations, was reported
yesterday to have formulated proposals for Palestinian autonomy in the
occupied territories.
structure of Palestinian ministries similar to Israeli government
ministries.
The Israeli newspaper Al-Hamishmar reported that Mr Shamir said in an
interview to be published in full later this week that the proposals offered
the Palestinians more than the autonomy envisaged in the 1987 Camp David
accords between Israel and Egypt.
It held out the possibility of political parties and a Palestinian police
force, along with control over a range of affairs from trade to education.
Palestinians, who have repeatedly rejected any formula which does not
ultimately offer them full independence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, are
unlikely to see much new in the proposals. In keeping with his long-standing
position, Mr Shamir said he was not offering sovereignty. Foreign affairs,
defence and what he described as security would remain under Israeli
control.
But Mr Shamir, who will meet Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and
other European leaders in London this week, when he visits for the
inauguration of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, hopes
to persuade the US and its allies to accept his plan for limited autonomy,
postponing discussion of a final settlement in the territories for at least
three years.

<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S government is to consider whether to try again for an agreement
with China on the colony's proposed HKDollars 100bn airport project. This
follows the failure at the weekend of 10 days of talks in Peking started
when Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign minister, visited the Chinese capital.
Sir David Wilson, the governor, held emergency meetings yesterday with two
senior UK diplomats involved in the Peking talks. He will now consult the
colony's executive council.
No agreement was reached because China is insisting on having effective
control or veto powers over detailed issues on the airport, which would set
precedents for it to interfere in other subjects.

JAPANESE companies which went bankrupt in the year to March left debts of
Y3,500bn, (Pounds 14.4bn) the third highest annual total on record,
according to a report by the Teikoku Data Bank, a research agency.
Teikoku Data Bank said 7,157 companies failed in the year to March, up 7.6
per cent on the previous year. Their liabilities were three times higher
than in 1989-90.
High interest rates, falling prices in the stock and land markets and labour
shortages contributed to the failures.
Bankers fear that this year's total could be much higher, as banks withdraw
support from increasing numbers of over-borrowed companies.

FT  15 APR 91 / The European Market: Inquiry signals change in Commission's
steel policy - The sector is now subject to normal competition rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Z Club sounds like a seedy, backstreet night club. The Z Club was indeed
slightly disreputable. But it was also highly exclusive. It was the most
elaborate attempt yet by Europe's steel producers to rig the market for
their products.
For most of the 1980s, the club brought together the main European stainless
steel producers for detailed discussions on how to restrain competition. In
the next few months, European Commission competition officials will discover
whether a successor to the Z Club has been rigging the market for heavy
beams and sections used in the construction industry.
The EC last week confirmed its officials in January raided the offices of
four steel manufacturers - British Steel, Usinor Sacilor of France, Arbed of
Luxembourg, and Peine Salzgitter, the German group - to gather information
on the suspected cartel. Two trade associations in Germany and France were
also raided.
The investigation seems to signal a change of Brussel's policy towards
steel. For more than a decade, the EC coaxed the industry through the crisis
of excess capacity which hit it in the mid-1970s.
The manifest crisis measures under the 1952 Treaty of Paris, which imposed
import limits and production quotas, were phased out in June 1988.
During the crisis, the EC officially sanctioned collusion between the main
producers, institutionalised by Eurofer, the European steel producers'
association set up 1976. It helped police the system to limit competition
and stabilise market shares.
The investigation into construction steel seems to mark an important shift
in the wake of the end of the quota regime. A competition policy official
said last week:'It is as though we have moved out of the old ghetto of steel
policy.
'We now have a philosophy here that the steel industry is a sector like any
other.' The companies could face fines up to a maximum of 10 per cent of
turnover if they are found guilty.
This EC signalled this shift last July when its inquiry into the Z Club
warned it would in future take 'severe action' against cartels.
The club brought together the presidents, commercial directors and export
managers of six European producers, including British Steel, Krupp and
Thyssen. Its anatomy was exposed in the formal record of the EC's decision,
which was hidden away in the EC's official journal for July 1990.
British Steel, which presents itself as the paragon of free market virtue,
proposed co-operation on prices at a meeting in Dusseldorf on February 27
1984. After a string of meetings, several producers agreed bilateral
'inter-penetration' deals to limit exports and imports.
By the time the club met in Paris on April 15 1986, a formal agreement was
in sight which was signed at a meeting a month later in Dusseldorf. The
agreement specified delivery quotas, a complex voting procedure for club
members, a system of fines for companies breaking the quotas, the make-up of
a secretariat, a pricing committee, and a market forecast committee.
The only external evidence of the lengths to which the producers were going
to fix the market came on October 1 1986 when the Z Club members raised
their prices on the day the formal agreement came into effect. That was
followed by a series of substantial price increases in the next two years.
Yet the club's existence was not a secret. In late May of 1986, Sir Robert
Scholey, the British Steel chairman, wrote to EC vice-president Karl-Heinz
Narjes, who was responsible for the steel industry, about the agreement to
establish the cartel. Five months later, Sir Robert wrote again, claiming to
have forwarded a copy of the cartel's constitution.
Although Vice-President Narjes replied that he could not sanction the
cartel, he took no action to break it up. The six producers were together
fined only Ecu425,000 Pounds 293,000) on the grounds that they thought
competition rules were modified throughout the sector by the manifest crisis
measures. The EC was an accessory to a crime it was itself investigating.
The investigation into construction steels was prompted by an inquiry in
Norway last year which discovered restrictions on imports designed to
maintain domestic steel prices.
It seems unlikely this investigation will uncover anything quite so
elaborate as the Z Club.
The companies have learned to become more circumspect. They talk of 'orderly
marketing arrangements', not price fixing. According to industry
specialists, senior executives rarely take part in such meetings, leaving
them to commercial directors whose actions can be disowned.
There may have been tacit agreements to limit imports to stabilise market
shares. Dr Derek Tordoff, of the British Constructional Steelwork
Association, says :'I understand that some form of tonnage quota agreement
may have existed in the past'. But it seems unlikely there was direct price
fixing.
There have been persistent complaints from steel consumers in the UK that
prices for heavy sections and beams are far stickier than for other products
such as hot rolled coil.
With the downturn in construction markets, the amount of steel processed by
fabricators for use in buildings has fallen from 1.4m tonnes in 1989 to a
rate of 1m tonnes this year.
With supply well in excess of demand, prices should have fallen. Yet the
fabricators who buy directly from British Steel say the companies pricing
policy has not changed.
Although prices on the Continent are sometimes 20-30 per cent lower than in
the UK, customers say they find it difficult to get foreign groups to bid
for contracts. When they do, the prices are within a whisker of British
Steel's. One fabricator with a plant in the UK and on the Continent says
:'It is cheaper for me to buy British Steel steel abroad and then ship it
back to the UK'.
British Steel, which is not commenting on the investigation, could retort
that prices quoted by stockholders, the middle men in the industry, have
fallen dramatically even if its prices have not. British construction groups
use old-fashioned Imperial measures for steel which are difficult for
Continental producers to supply.
Two forces may be pushing the industry away from cartels and collusion
between a large number of national producers, towards competition between
more concentrated more international groupings.
Firstly, industrial restructuring is promoting growing concentration and
seemingly, more competition. The 8m-tonne-a-year market is now dominated by
a joint venture between Usinor Sacilor and Arbed and British Steel. Usinor
Sacilor is buying its way into the UK market through acquisition, while
British Steel is doing the same on the Continent.
Secondly, the Treaty of Paris may be reverting to its original role. It was
originally based on laissez-faire principles to eliminate tariff barriers,
subsidies and cartels.
Sir Leon is attempting to restore the treaty's historic purpose. If they are
found guilty, the producers will be dealt with far less leniently than the
members of the Z Club.

FT  15 APR 91 / Britain expected to bridle at EC foreign policy plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is expected to bridle at plans laid before EC foreign ministers
today by the Luxembourg presidency for implementing common foreign policy
decisions by majority vote, and for the European Parliament to have a say in
Euro-law making equal to that enjoyed by governments.
These two key plans have been released for foreign ministers to discuss at
today's session of the inter-governmental conference (IGC), ahead of the
95-page compromise text on political union that Luxembourg is tabling
tomorrow.
The two IGCs on political and monetary union have been in session for three
months, and Luxembourg is seeking overall agreement by late June.
Luxembourg officials claimed yesterday their text on common foreign and
security policy (CFSP) had been well received by EC partners, and even
British diplomats admit that since the Luxembourg draft is drawing equal
fire from proponents and opponents of fast moves to a CFSP, the presidency
has probably judged it right.
Britain has always objected to the possibility of being outvoted in so
sensitive an area as foreign and security policy. But the Luxembourg plan
only foresees that 'the means of applying a common action would be adopted
by majority vote', preserving unanimity as the rule by which the Twelve
would carry out a CFSP.
Initial areas of 'common action' would include arms co-operation and
control, UN peace-keeping operations, and possibly, relations with the US
and Eastern Europe. EC leaders could by unanimity at their regular summits
decide on more such areas of common action, in which governments would be
constrained, politically but not legally, from acting freelance.
A particular article of the Luxembourg draft would require Britain and
France, the EC's only two members in the UN Security Council, to put their
voting there in line with EC partners' wishes.
To the relief of Britain, neutral Ireland and pacifist Denmark, the
Luxembourg draft skates over EC relations with the Western European Union
defence organisation in one sentence, saying the decision with defence
implications 'can be entirely or partially implemented in the framework of
the WEU to the degree they also come within the competence of this body'.
But to placate those mainly Latin countries which want to bring defence
within the EC faster, the draft says the WEU arrangement 'could be reviewed,
on the basis of a report to be submitted by 1996 at the latest' to an EC
summit.
The Luxembourg compromise on the parliament is to deny it a right of
initiative, but give it 'co-decision' with the EC Council of Ministers on a
new category of 'framework laws'. Now, the parliament can only amend, but
not totally reject, EC legislation.
Under the Luxembourg draft, on certain basic legislation of political rather
than technical import, the parliament would have equal law-making rights
with the Council.
If the two could not agree, a committee would try to conciliate. But the
parliament could, in the end, kill EC laws.

GREECE is to lift curbs on long-term capital outflow next month, allowing
Greeks to invest in property and securities abroad, Kerin Hope reports from
Athens. Mr Dimitris Chalikias, Bank of Greece governor, said the new rules
take effect in May.
Greece was granted two extensions for complying with an EC directive on
freeing outward capital movement on the grounds of its worsening current
account deficit, totalling over 5 per cent of GDP last year. But under an EC
emergency loan, no further delays can be allowed. Mr Chalikias dismissed
fears that the current account deficit will be fuelled by huge capital
flight.
Capital transfers abroad could be handled by commercial banks without
central bank approval. Curbs on foreign exchange allowances will be eased;
the Dollars 300-a-year ceiling on credit card purchases made abroad will be
scrapped.

<TEXT>
TWO armed thieves stole 20 paintings by Vincent Van Gogh from Amsterdam's
Van Gogh Museum yesterday but abandoned their haul - worth more than Dollars
200m (Pounds 112.9m) - less than an hour later near a city railway station.
Police said they had no idea why the two masked thieves had decided to
abandon the paintings and their getaway car after managing to pull off the
biggest art theft in the Netherlands since the Second World War.
The 20 paintings, which were worth at least Dollars 10m each, included such
works as The Potato Eaters, Self-portrait As Painter, and Still Life With
Sunflowers. The museum houses the world's single biggest collection of
paintings by Van Gogh, whose work soared in value on the art market in the
1980s.
Police said they had no trace of the masked thieves, who were described only
as two men who spoke English with American accents.
One of the thieves may have hidden in the museum just before closing time on
Saturday afternoon, according to police. Around 3am, he overpowered two
security guards and forced them to turn off the alarms. He then let the
second man into the building.
About 45 minutes later, the thieves fled after forcing one of the guards to
hand over the keys to his car, a Volkswagen Passat. Shortly thereafter, the
car and the paintings were found near the Amstel train station just outside
the city centre.
Three of the 20 paintings were seriously damaged but they will be restored,
Mr Ronald de Leeuw, the director of the museum, said. A police spokesman
said: 'The robbery seemed to be well thought out but the ending was
amateurish.'
The spectacular robbery is the fourth theft of Van Gogh paintings in The
Netherlands in the past three years. It also comes just a year after the
museum marked the 100th anniversary of Van Gogh's death with a major
exhibition of 135 paintings, including many on loan for four months from
foreign museums and collectors.
The insurance cover for the borrowed works totalled Dollars 3.2bn.
The paintings which were stolen and then recovered yesterday were uninsured,
in line with Dutch government policy of not insuring works of art in order
to free up funds for other spending on the arts.

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Birgit Breuel, a disciple of economic liberalism, this weekend took on
one of the most daunting economic assignments Germany has to offer.
The 53-year-old Christian Democratic (CDU) economics official was chosen to
succeed the late Detlev Karsten Rohwedder, assassinated by terrorists
earlier this month, as president of the Treuhand agency for the
privatisation of east German companies. Mrs Breuel had served since last
October as the Treuhand board member responsible for its regional offices.
Faced with an imminent collapse of industrial production and mass
unemployment in the East, Treuhand recently announced a big shift in its
priorities.
Henceforth, company reorganisation is to take precedence over privatisation
at all cost. Mrs Breuel, however, sought to reconcile the two when she noted
that privatisation was the 'best form of reorganisation'. Investments and
the securing of jobs would be 'at least as valuable' as proceeds from the
sale of companies to the private sector, she said in east Berlin.
Mrs Breuel was chosen in a unanimous vote by Treuhand's administrative board
after receiving the approval of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Theo Waigel,
the economics minister, who oversees the agency.
A newly-created post of Treuhand vice-president is to be filled by a
prominent west German company executive and is designed to compensate for
the new president's lack of managerial experience.
A Treuhand official, acknowledging Mrs Breuel's competence, nonetheless
criticised her for being the 'Margaret Thatcher' of the agency. It was
politically inopportune to have someone with her economic views in the top
post at such a critical time he suggested.
As if to belie this reputation, Mrs Breuel spoke compassionately to the
media of her 'great sympathy for the worries of people'.
Her late father, Alvin Munchmeyer, a prominent Hamburg banker, instilled
economic discipline in his children by demanding a strict accounting of how
they spent pocket money, she has recalled.
She studied political science in Hamburg, Oxford and Geneva and worked for a
time in economic research posts in New York and Hamburg.
Her reputation as a disciple of monetarist economist Mr Milton Friedman
stemmed from extensive praise of him in her book, Unsaddling The
Bureaucratic Nag. Mrs Breuel was a CDU member of the Hamburg legislature
from 1970 to 1978 and served as economics minister of the state of Lower
Saxony and its finance minister until she joined Treuhand last year.

MR Yaswant Sinha, the Indian finance minister, yesterday assured the
country's international creditors that India would not default on its debt
repayments during the next critical three-and-a-half months before a new
government can present a budget.
At a press conference in New Delhi, Mr Sinha said: 'Whatever it takes will
be done to see that India meets its commitments. We shall not allow any
default.' He also ruled out a debt rescheduling.
Mr Sinha was speaking after returning from Tokyo where he secured Dollars
150m (Pounds 84.7m) in immediate foreign exchange assistance from Japan as
part of an Asian Development Bank co-financing of petroleum imports.
He also said that Japan had promised to speed up other other aid - worth
about Dollars 350m. But he said that this would be finalised in discussions
with Japan and other donor nations in Washington at the end of the month
during the spring meetings of the World Bank and the IMF.
The finance minister said that he expected other donor nations to come to
India's support, but declined to be specific. 'We are not quite bereft of
friends,' he said.
Mr Sinha made his announcement as the general election campaign got underway
with Mr VP Singh's National Front being the first major party yesterday to
present its manifesto. The Front, which is contesting the election in
alliance with the left, confirmed that the central plank in its platform
would be implementing Mr Singh's promise of 55-59 per cent central
government job reservation for the poor and the lower castes.

FT  15 APR 91 / Gorbachev's Japan visit raises island hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR small islands, with a few thousand inhabitants, some military
installations and a lot of fish, have kept relations between the Soviet
Union and Japan icily formal since the war. No treaty has been signed since
hostilities between them stopped: though not at war, they are not at peace
either.
Now, with the visit to Japan this week of Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet
president, the air is pregnant with possibilities.
The Kuril Islands stand between the two countries, north-east of Japan and
south-west of Siberia. Soviet soldiers seized them in 1945 although Japan
has never gives up its claim to the islands, which it calls the Northern
Territories.
The possibility of the Soviet Union restoring the islands to Japan after 47
years is now being mooted, especially on the Soviet side, where suggestions
that Japan might pay a large price to get the islands back is being talked
about with some eagerness. In Japan, there is less optimism about the
possibility of a settlement although Foreign Ministry officials say they are
looking for 'a breakthrough' on the territorial question.
The territorial issue apart, there is a widespread - if rather vague - hope
in Tokyo that the visit will improve bilateral relations and promote a
general easing of tensions in the Asia-Pacific region. 'If any person can
bring about any dynamic change in the relationship it can be Mr Gorbachev,
who started perestroika,' Mr Taizo Watanabe, Japan's foreign affairs
spokesman, said on Friday.
Mr Gorbachev's visit which starts tomorrow is the first to Japan by a Soviet
leader. If he can resolve the territorial issue, a vast area of co-operation
could open up between the two countries.
Talk in the Soviet Union is that Japan might pay between Dollars 20bn and
Dollars 30bn for the islands. It is not just economic benefits that interest
the Soviet side; the issue has become bound up in the conflict between the
two giants of the Soviet political scene, Mr Gorbachev and Mr Boris Yeltsin,
the Russian leader. Mr Yeltsin has said the islands shall not pass from
Russian hands: at the other side of the political scene, the Soviet military
say they are of great strategic importance.
Dr Georgy Kunadze, the country's leading expert on the issue and head of the
Far East division at the foreign policy think tank IMEMO, cautions against
expecting too much.
'He cannot simply go there and 'sell' the Kurils. The Japanese cannot expect
it. We have been too proud for too long to suddenly change.'
But Dr Kunadze believes the issue can be resolved on the basis of three main
elements. First, he believes Mr Gorbachev could revive an offer the Soviet
Union made to Japan in 1956. This envisages the return of the islands
nearest to the Japanese mainland - the Habomai Group and Shikotan. Further
negotiations would take place on the other two, Etorofu and Kunashiri, while
relations are normalised.
An offer from Mr Gorbachev on these lines could be a starting point,
although Japanese officials say agreement would have to be on all four
islands.
Second, Dr Kunadze believes the Soviet Union should be compensated for the
infrastructure built on the islands since the war. A reasonable price, he
thinks, might be Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.6bn).
Third, credits and loans should also be discussed. However, these should be
relatively modest since the capacity for the unreformed Soviet economy to
productively use foreign credits is low. A sum of Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn
would be enough, he thinks, with perhaps a further Dollars 10bn in loans.
Though he is scornful of the rumoured figures, his sums do end up in the
Pounds 20bn-Dollars 30bn range which Japanese politicians are reported to
have suggested.
Soviet and Japanese officials have drafted over 12 separate agreements for
Mr Gorbachev and Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the Japanese prime minister, to sign.
They include Japanese offers to send technological experts to Moscow and to
accept Soviet trainees in Japan, plus other forms of aid to Soviet industry.
But, without progress on the territorial issue, Tokyo is unlikely to drop
its previous refusal to extend government-backed loans and grants.

FT  15 APR 91 / Row strains new Italian cabinet
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN unprecedented row has broken out within Italy's new government, barely
hours after Mr Giulio Andreotti, the caretaker prime minister, announced the
list of ministers in his new administration, Italy's 50th since the Second
World War.
Three Republican Party ministers have decided not to take up their posts,
following claims by the Republicans that Mr Andreotti did not give them the
ministerial posts promised in last week's talks on resolving the country's
political crisis.
The new crisis within a crisis means only four of the five parties which
have governed Italy in coalition since the early 1980s are likely to be
represented in the government. However, the Republicans are expected to form
part of the governing majority in parliament.
The party, whose secretary, Mr Giorgio La Malfa, resigned on Saturday
following the debacle over the cabinet positions, is due to meet this
afternoon to decide its next move.
Meanwhile, Mr Andreotti has taken all three of the disputed ministries -
state shareholdings, culture and regional affairs - under his wing on a
temporary basis, at least until the new government presents itself before
parliament tomorrow.
In a statement on Saturday, the Republicans accused Mr Andreotti of not
observing the rules of consulting them adequately in forming the new
government.
Mr Andreotti, whose task in allocating ministries has been complicated by
the need to find positions for the left wing of his own Christian Democratic
party, which has now decided to re-enter the cabinet, said that ministerial
positions had been offered to the three candidates the Republicans put
forward.
The dispute has been exacerbated by the fact that the Republicans were not
offered the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
The portfolio was formerly occupied by one of their leaders, Mr Oscar Mammi.
The ministry has grown in political importance as a result of new laws
passed last year on monopoly control in broadcasting and the media.
This legislation will seriously affect the activities of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, Italy's media magnate.
Meanwhile, President Francesco Cossiga, has attempted to explain his
acquiescence to the new government's decision to put off discussion of
constitutional reform until after next year's general elections. In a
rambling television interview, the president said that avoiding early
elections in the last year of the present parliament had to take priority
over all else.
That is a far cry from his earlier unparallelled political interventions, in
which Mr Cossiga endeavoured to place constitutional reform at the top of
the political agenda.
Despite all his fighting talk about using his powers to the full to ensure
political reform, Mr Cossiga appears to have accepted the new government's
programme without demur.
