FT  08 MAY 91 / Operators review travel to Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH tour operators and travel agents were yesterday reviewing the
position facing travel to Yugoslavia after the latest outbreak of violence,
David Churchill writes.
They were concerned about the lack of firm guidance by the Foreign Office
about travel to Yugoslavia. A number of leading operators are understood to
support a move to ban holiday travel to the country in advance of any
Foreign Office ruling.
The latest Foreign Office advice is for travellers to avoid the area between
Karlovac and Sisak in the north of the country and Split and Gospic to the
south, including the coast road. They should also avoid travelling in the
area of Croatia to the north of the Zagreb-Belgrade motorway.
The Foreign Office said there was no reason for travellers to avoid the main
cities in the tourist areas of Istria, Slovenia and Montenegro.
Yugotours, the largest operator to the country and backed by the Yugoslav
government, has some 2,500 Britons at present on holiday in Yugoslavia.
Last year about 800,000 Britons went to Yugoslavia, mainly to the coastal
seaside resorts, where holidays were considerably less expensive than their
Spanish equivalent.
Even before the Gulf War, however, the market this year was looking bleak
because of the UK recession.
Now Yugoslavia's tourist industry, its biggest foreign exchange earner,
faces the effects of the nationalist upheavals. Tourism brought in an
estimated Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.27bn) in 1989 and at least 10 per cent
more last year.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Howard praises small business growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of small companies is continuing to grow in spite of the
recession, Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, told small-business
leaders yesterday.
Mr Howard sought to counter reports of a rising tide of business failures by
disclosing provisional figures showing that the number of small businesses
grew by an average of 800 a week last year.
Although that is a steep fall from the growth rate of 1,700 a week in 1989,
it is still higher than the average rate of business formation over the
whole of the last decade.
Mr Howard, launching the Department of Employment's 1991 report on the small
companies' sector of the economy, said the recession was providing further
proof of the flexibility and adaptability of small businesses.
The report shows that there was 29 per cent growth in the number of small
businesses between 1979 and 1989, from about 1.3m to more than 1.6m.
Self-employment rose by more than 70 per cent from just under 2m to 3.25m.
New registrations of businesses for value added tax are running at about 16
per cent of the total stock of businesses, while deregistrations are running
at about 11 per cent.
Even with the rise in business failures because of the recession,
insolvencies account for about 1 per cent of the stock of businesses, Mr
Howard said.
Bank funding to businesses with a turnover of less than Pounds 1m doubled to
about Pounds 40bn a year over the past five years.
Mr Howard said the network of local Training and Enterprise Councils in
England and Wales would play an increasingly central role in developing and
delivering policies to promote the creation of small companies, to help
owners manage the growth of their businesses and to encourage improved
training within small companies.
Mr Howard said the Tecs were creating local business leadership of a quality
never before seen in the UK. They would work with the government to develop
the sector.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Heartburn in US over vice-president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORRIES at the weekend over President George Bush's heartbeat, now
regular again, have turned into an intense debate, dominating television
programmes and newspapers, over the qualifications of Vice-President Dan
Quayle.
The revival of the Quayle question has been underlined by two new opinion
polls indicating that most people in the US believe he should be dropped
from the Republican ticket for the presidential election next year.
According to a Washington Post/ABC News poll, 57 per cent believe he is not
qualified to become president and 54 per cent think Mr Bush should put
someone else on the ticket next year. A narrow majority, however, believes
he is qualified to be vice-president.
A USA Today poll shows 46 per cent thinking Mr Quayle is not qualified to be
president and 51 per cent arguing that he should be dropped next year.
The official White House line has been that Mr Quayle will remain on the
ticket next year. In face of critical media comment, senior administration
officials rallied round to defend the vice-president, praising his
contribution to decisions.
During his foreign visits, Mr Quayle has assiduously promoted US exports and
contracts, and he is said to play a more active role in internal White House
discussions than Mr Bush did when he was vice-president (1981-89).
Mr Quayle is generally seen as speaking in favour of the conservative side
of any case.

FT  08 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Semiconductor industry finds political
ammunition - FT writers in Tokyo and San Francisco look at the opposing
arguments in a fresh trade dispute over critical technologies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENATOR Lloyd Bentsen's pronouncement this week that Japanese semiconductor
processing equipment companies are withholding their latest technology from
US chip makers highlights US fears of growing dependence on Japanese
suppliers of critical technologies.
Such fears give political ammunition to the US semiconductor industry and
its Washington supporters. Senator Bentsen, Senate Finance Committee
chairman, is among the US chip industry's most powerful political allies.
That US chip makers depend increasingly on Japanese suppliers for production
tools is hardly news. Japanese companies dominate several key segments of
the semiconductor equipment market. The US wafer processing equipment
industry suffered loss of market share in the 1980s, according to a national
security assessment released by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Export
Administration last week.
This says the US chip production equipment industry 'is vital to the success
of semiconductor manufacturing'. The health of US equipment companies
'affects viability of the semiconductor industry', which in turn is crucial
for enhancing industrial capabilities, and as a source of technical military
advantage.
Privately, US semiconductor executives complain they cannot get advanced
equipment from Japan until long after their Japanese competitors. But
evidence to support US industry charges that Japanese equipment makers
deliberately delay shipments has, until now, been scant.
Senator Bentsen claims that a General Accounting Office (GAO) investigation
has uncovered several cases of alleged delays or refusals to ship critical
Japanese equipment to US companies. In other cases, he says, US chip makers
have had to pay prices 20-30 per cent higher than their Japanese competitors
to obtain the latest equipment. GAO investigators had trouble getting US
chip executives to state their problems, one industry expert said. 'US
executives are afraid to criticise Japanese equipment companies. They fear
reprisals.'
With publication by Senator Bentsen of a list of seven Japanese companies
alleged to have deliberately withheld technology from US chip makers, the
industry's code of silence is breaking down. Advanced Micro Devices said
this week it could not obtain a piece of equipment it knew its Japanese
partner was using in a US production facility. 'We agree with the Senator's
premise that the Japanese do hold back the latest equipment from us,' said
Mr James Owens Jr, vice-president of world-wide wafer fabrication technology
at National Semiconductor.
Japanese responses cite lack of US service and support arrangements, or
delays in translating manuals. 'These are just excuses,' the industry expert
says. Fears of dependence on foreign tool suppliers have fuelled US chip
industry support for Sematech, the government-funded consortium, whose
mission has become to revitalise the US semiconductor equipment and
materials industry.
The GAO report, for release this summer, is likely to stress the need for a
strong domestic chip equipment industry. Publication could coincide with
calls to renew Defence Department funding for Sematech beyond its five-year
charter.
Senator Bentsen's preview seems timed to boost pressure on Japan to open its
chip market further. US and Japanese trade officials were due to resume
talks yesterday to seek a new chip trade pact. South Korea is seeking to
build an equipment industry able to meet half its semiconductor industry
needs by the year 2000. Japanese dependence on US equipment makers led it to
create its own chip production equipment industry.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US COURT of Appeals yesterday reversed a 1987 bankruptcy court decision
that the Justice Department stole special software developed by Inslaw, a
Washington-based computer software company.
The decision is a blow to Inslaw, which claims its case-tracking software,
known as Promis, found its way to the intelligence services of Canada,
Israel and Iraq after its alleged theft by the department. The decision also
reverses a 1988 federal district court ruling that upheld the bankruptcy
court's view that the department stole the software by 'trickery, fraud and
deceit'.
Yesterday's ruling was based on the view that the federal bankruptcy court
had no authority, on jurisdictional grounds, to hand down its 1987 decision
against the department.
Mr Elliot Richardson, Inslaw's defence lawyer and a former US
Attorney-General, said: 'This is a narrow jurisdictional ruling. The lower
courts' findings that the Department of Justice stole Inslaw's software were
not addressed.' Inslaw has 45 days to decide whether to petition the appeals
court to reconsider, or the company could file a suit based on the Trade
Secrets Act or ask the Supreme Court to hear the case.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Ill wind from Gulf blows growth for Venezuelans: Robert
Graham runs the rule over an economy where a renewed oil boom is banishing
recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and JOE MANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CELLULAR telephones were recently banned from one fashionable restaurant in
Caracas; there were so many, and they were being used to talk from one table
to another.
Venezuelans conscious of status symbols once again are unafraid to display
their wealth. The shopping malls of Caracas, the richest in Latin America,
are fully stocked and heavily patronised. Talk of hard times is over, and
the country is looking forward to another oil-based boom. Growth this year
could be as high as 8 per cent.
This is all very different from a year ago, when the country was gripped by
recession and still traumatised by the aftermath of the violent rioting in
February 1989, which led to more than 350 deaths.
'It hasn't been easy, but we have regained confidence and recovered our
morale, which took a beating after the riots,' said a local businessman.
The recession was brief but painful. To come to terms with the burden of its
Dollars 31bn foreign debt and gross overspending in the public sector, the
government of President Carlos Andres Perez imposed a tough economic
adjustment programme two years ago. Per capita incomes fell by an
unprecedented 9 per cent.
The government can claim credit for introducing the correct macro-economic
policies. Damaging exchange rate distortions have been removed, the foreign
debt has been rescheduled, trade liberalised, public spending cut, subsidies
have been largely removed and prices freed.
So inflation has been trimmed from an annual 90 per cent to 35 per cent, and
is still falling. The public sector has swung from an inherited deficit of
nearly 9 per cent of GDP to a 1.2 per cent surplus predicted for this year.
Venezuela was the great beneficiary of the Gulf crisis. Each dollar rise in
the price of oil per barrel added Dollars 55m a month to the country's oil
earnings. The rise in crude prices thus increased those earnings by Dollars
2.5bn last year, with a further Dollars 1.2bn coming from increased
production. With the oil sector accounting for almost 90 per cent of
exports, total export earnings increased 39 per cent to Dollars 17.6bn.
According to Dr Pedro Rosas, deputy planning minister, the budget this year
is being based on an oil price of Dollars 19 per barrel with exports seen
conservatively at 1.9m barrels a day. A Dollars 1.2bn stabilisation fund has
been created to accommodate any fluctuations, with a further buffer from
reserves expected to reach Dollars 13bn by year-end.
Events in the Gulf highlighted Venezuela's position as the only large-volume
oil producer outside the Middle East with sustained long-term export
capacity - and the Gulf conflict erupted just as the Venezuelan economy was
pulling out of recession.
However, the windfall oil profits threatened to undermine inflation targets
and relax fiscal discipline. Plans for privatisation slowed, as did the
promise of fiscal reform.
Dr Rosas insists the government will restructure taxes this year. Corporate
and income taxes will be cut to stimulate investment and savings, while the
Treasury's take will be made up by an increase in value-added tax.
Privatisation seems to be picking up momentum. The government has stated
conditions for the sale of 60 per cent of the international airline, Viasa.
Another airline, Aeropostal, with two banks (Italo Venezolano and
Republica), the telecommunications group CANTV, tourist hotels, sugar mills
and an energy company are also lined up. Some foreign investment will be
allowed.
Having introduced more liberal foreign investment laws, President Perez is
beginning to live down his reputation for being against foreign capital,
this gained from his nationalisation of the oil industry in the 1970s. Parts
of the oil industry are now being opened to foreign capital. Nine
petrochemical 'megaprojects', totalling Dollars 3bn, are to go to tender
this year, with debt conversion financial packages encouraged. Foreign
companies will also be allowed to develop the country's large gas reserves
and explore for oil in new areas or exploit marginal fields.
The lion's share will remain with PVDSA, the state oil concern, which plans
to invest a staggering Dollars 34bn in Venezuela by 1996. PVDSA finds itself
increasingly limited by its membership of the Organisation of
Petroleum-Exporting Countries, but Mr Perez remains firmly attached to the
ideals of this cartel, which Venezuela helped to found.
Despite a sustained growth projection of more than 6 per cent for the
foreseeable future, and the many opportunites developing, foreign investors
are still exceptionally wary. Too much bureauracy and too much opportunity
for corruption surround investment procedures.
Foreign investors mistrust the private sector, which mouths support for a
free market economy but seeks to keep its cartels and cosy relationship with
the state apparatus.
While well thought of, the economic team lacks depth and political weight.
This makes it harder to resist the multiple calls on the state purse. It
will also require the full authority of Mr Perez to hold down the unions'
current pay demands, prompted by the need of large segments of society to
return to their income levels of the mid-eighties.
The unions are struggling to retain their influence, which is being
undermined by the liberalisation. Their main strategy is to arrange to
support one or both of the two main political parties, the Christian
democratic COPEI and the ruling social democratic Democratic Action (AD).
Both are desperately trying, meanwhile, to preserve their role as those
which how the national cake is divided.
A subtler challenge comes from the need to raise the educational level of
the workforce and resolve potential staff shortages.
Renewed high growth will create a tight labour market in country with a
population of only 11m. Unemployment is down to 8 per cent, despite some 2m
Colombians working legally and illegally in the country, mainly in
agricultural and domestic employment.
Senior Venezuelan officials are also looking to eastern Europe. Indeed, if
the boom does become consolidated, Venezuela may witness a wave of
immigration, as in the 1950s.
VENEZUELA'S national oil company, PDVSA, plans to raise Dollars 300m via
international bond issues, according to a press report in Caracas, reports
Joe Mann in Caracas. The business newspaper, Economia Hoy, reported that the
company would obtain Dollars 100m from bonds to be issued by the Republic of
Venezuela, and another Dollars 200m from bonds to be issued by itself. The
state-owned company has not directly borrowed money on international markets
since it was established in 1975.

<TEXT>
JAPANESE electronics companies yesterday were angered by a leading US
senator's claims that they were withholding advanced semiconductor
technology from US chip makers under a strategy to dominate the world
market.
The Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) said the claims were
ridiculous, while one of the seven companies cited, Hitachi, said it has
never even received a US order for the equipment it is alleged to have
withheld.
Hitachi said: 'We cannot understand why this allegation has been made. If we
did receive an order, we would provide the equipment'. It was claimed
Hitachi had limited sales to US companies of technology used to process
semiconductor wafers.
Japanese company officials were annoyed that the statement was made during a
visit to Sematech, the US government and industry semiconductor joint
venture, and saw the claims, which Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Senate finance
committee chairman, said arose from evidence gathered by a General
Accounting Office investigation, as mere politicking.
Government officials in Tokyo were irritated that the allegations should
come as US and Japanese officials are in the final stages of negotiating a
new agreement on foreign access to the Japanese semiconductor market.
The suggestion by Senator Bentsen that equipment sold to US companies is at
prices 20-30 per cent higher than those paid by Japanese companies was
denied by the EIAJ, which said the increasing number of US and Japanese
joint development projects was evidence of Japanese companies' willingness
to transfer technology.
'Companies like Hitachi have been eager to find foreign partners. These
types of comments reflect an attitude of trying to find fault with others,
and not being able to see your own faults,' an EIAJ official said. Canon,
another of the companies cited, said 'the claims contain no facts' and
insisted: 'We conduct business fairly throughout the world, including the US
and Europe'.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Curfew in Washington to prevent more riots
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CITY officials in Washington reimposed a night curfew late yesterday on a
mainly Hispanic area of the city in an attempt to prevent a third night of
riots and looting.
The Mount Pleasant area of the US capital, about two miles from the White
House, was under curfew and a state of emergency, as was the district of
Adams Morgan, between midnight Monday and early yesterday morning.
The disturbances have involved gangs of youths breaking shop windows and
looting, fires, destruction of vehicles, and skirmishes with a thousand
police officers.
Calm prevailed during daylight yesterday. The new curfew last night was to
be from 7 pm to 5 am.
Deputy Police Chief Edward Spurlock said the disturbances were the worst in
Washington since 1968, after the assassination of Martin Luther King jr, the
black civil rights leader.
The violence, though contained within a few hundred square yards, crossed
16th Street, one of the city's main arteries and came within walking
distance of the main residential and office areas.
The disturbances followed the shooting of a Hispanic man by a police officer
who was trying to detain him for public drinking. According to the police,
the man, now in a critical condition, drew a knife; a Hispanic witness said
he was handcuffed when shot.
This triggered the waves of violence against property and police on Sunday
and Monday evenings in the Mount Pleasant and Adams Morgan areas.
The latest events have underlined tensions between the generally poor
Hispanic community and the District of Columbia government and police, which
are predominantly black, reflecting the city's racial composition.
Hispanic/black tensions in Washington have been matched in other US cities,
where there are large Spanish-speaking populations, often made up of recent
immigrants, who argue that they are badly treated.
After the first night's riots, local residents told the new mayor, Ms Sharon
Pratt Dixon, that Hispanic people were harassed by the police and poorly
treated by city agencies. Many of the Hispanics are recent refugees from
central America and speak only Spanish.
Ms Dixon promised to improve communications and said district agencies would
hire more Hispanic people.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Angola ripe for an economic revolution: After the peace
deal, Julian Ozanne considers the potential of a resource-rich country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW COUNTRIES in the world have squandered their vast potential wealth as
carelessly as Angola.
Easily one of the richest five countries in sub-Saharan Africa with abundant
fertile land, huge fishing and mineral resources, extensive petroleum
deposits and tremendous energy and irrigation potential from the country's
rivers, the Angolan economy today is one of the most under-developed,
distorted and anarchic on the continent.
Sixteen years of destructive civil war and foreign invasion have left a
devastating toll. Last week's peace agreement initialled in Lisbon between
the government and Unita rebels offers hope of a substantial economic
turnaround. But even with peace and normality returning to the country the
government's economic policies will have to be substantially revised.
While many African countries woke up to the necessity of fundamental
economic adjustment by the mid-1980s, socialist Angola kept its head buried
in the sand.
Obstruction by party ideologues kept a plan for economic reform, presented
to the government in 1987, from being implemented.
Almost four years later the government announced the first minor devaluation
of the currency for 15 years from kwanza 30 to 60 to the dollar (the
parallel market rate is about kwanza 1,200 to the dollar), an insignificant
change in economic terms but an important symbol of a growing commitment to
adjustment.
'A few people in the government do now understand that there is no
alternative to sweeping economic change,' said Mr Aguinaldo Jaime, the
finance minister. 'But the fact is we have an economic system that does not
work. It is artificial and inefficient.'
The task of policy reform is formidable. Since independence in 1975 the
government has pursued a centrally-planned economy with extensive
bureaucratic controls, including administrative allocation of foreign
exchange, a fixed exchange rate, rigid price controls, rationing of consumer
goods through inadequately supplied state shops, and state control of
industry. Many prices and salaries have remained unchanged since 1975.
The results were inevitable. Industry, under poor management and critically
short of imported inputs, ground to a halt.
Angola, once a food exporter, became dependent on food imports. A huge,
bustling parallel market grew up where the dollar traded at realistic
levels, prices were set by market forces and Angolans sold off the surplus
of the few basic goods they could buy at state-run shops with a ration card.
A glimpse of how distorted the economy has become was given last October
when the government tried to mop up 95 per cent of the excessive money
supply it had printed over the years to fuel its budget deficits. Angolans
had to hand in their old kwanzas and were only given back five 'novo'
kwanzas for every hundred surrendered. The government promised the remainder
would be paid in time.
The banks took in 90bn kwanzas out of an estimated 150bn in circulation. For
a short period there was chaos and prices dropped dramatically on the
unofficial markets.
But they have increased markedly since, largely because the government was
unable to inject goods into the state-run stores to meet unfulfilled demand.
The minister of trade was sacked shortly afterwards amid allegations that
imported goods destined for state shops had been 'diverted' to the parallel
market or across the border into Zaire.
Unsustainable levels of public expenditure, with budget deficits reaching as
much as 12-15 per cent of GDP, have been possible because of Angola's
growing oil industry, which has traditionally provided about 65 per cent of
government revenues.
The oil sector, which exported 476,000 barrels a day last year, has also
kept the balance of payments afloat. With large oil earnings, Dollars 2.7bn
(Pounds 1.6bn) in 1989, Angola has generated healthy trade surpluses
throughout the 1980s.
But these have been marred by large and increasing deficits in the services
account, particularly in interest payments, transport and travel, and by a
growing debt service burden, estimated at between 45-55 per cent of exports
before debt rescheduling.
Angola's external debt is more than Dollars 7bn (about 90-95 per cent of
GDP), of which at least half is owed to the Soviet Union. In recent years
Angola has increasingly drawn on short-term commercial borrowing and has
accumulated significant payments arrears.
Resolution of the civil war will be crucial to economic revival. The war has
regularly absorbed 60 per cent of foreign exchange earnings and, according
to the United Nations, cost Angola Dollars 27-Dollars 30bn between 1980-88.
The new economic team has promised sweeping reform this year including
creeping devaluation, privatisation of many of the 400 state enterprises, an
overhaul of the banking system, and price and trade liberalisation.
However, their ability to implement the necessary measures to boost the
economy is being restricted by the reluctance of the party elite to change
during profound political change.
The few members of the ruling MPLA party who believe they have a chance of
winning the country's first free democratic elections are extremely nervous
of the impact of austerity measures and adjustment on their popularity,
especially in the urban areas.
Those in the MPLA who recognise they have no chance of electoral victory
want to keep the economic status quo because the distortions provide ample
opportunity to the party elite for substantial economic privileges.
'Economic reform is being held back by an unholy alliance of crooks and
ideologues and crooks hiding behind ideology who have vested interests in
the black market and the controlled economy,' said one western diplomat.
'Many MPLA people are grabbing as much as they can before tomorrow comes
because they know tomorrow will not belong to them.'

FT  08 MAY 91 / De Klerk meets Buthelezi over ANC ultimatum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S president, Mr F W de Klerk, yesterday met the Zulu leader,
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, in an attempt to end the country's township
violence and prevent the collapse of the negotiating process with the
African National Congress.
Mr de Klerk said that he told Chief Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom
Party, during more than three hours of talks that he planned to go ahead
with curbs on the right of Zulu tribesmen to carry traditional weapons.
The ANC has threatened to boycott talks on a new constitution from tomorrow
unless the government acts to end violence by complying with a seven-point
ultimatum it issued last month, which included the banning of traditional
weapons and the sacking of the cabinet ministers in charge of security.
Inkatha insists that spears and clubs are part of Zulu culture. The ANC
argues that Zulu weapons increase hostilities in black townships.
Mr de Klerk said last night that details of the clampdown on weapons would
be withheld until he had met Mr Nelson Mandela, deputy president of the ANC,
some time before tomorrow's deadline.
The Star newspaper of Johannesburg said yesterday that the ANC would
reconsider its threat to pull out of talks with the government if
legislation banning traditional weapons was approved; if the government took
steps to phase out single-sex workers' hostels - centres of township
violence; and if assurances were given that the police would act impartially
in township clashes. The ANC has accused police of siding with Inkatha, and
it has demanded the hostels be converted into family dwellings.
High-ranking ANC officials released a solemnly worded pledge for peace
yesterday which made no accusations but reiterated the ANC's position, in a
less-demanding style than usual. 'It is the duty of the government to
protect all citizens. In particular, the security forces must not favour any
party or organisation,' said the statement. 'Individuals must not be allowed
to carry weapons in public, traditional or otherwise.'
Of the remaining demands, the ANC has abandoned its insistence that Mr de
Klerk sack his ministers of law and order and defence; and progress has
previously been made on the ANC's call for a commission of inquiry into
violence, for the suspension of police officers involved in some recent
township killings, and for the disbanding of counter-insurgency units.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Tudjman carries fight to UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY, East Europe Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROATIA'S president, Mr Franjo Tudjman, last night launched a bitter attack
against the neighbouring republic of Serbia, and sections of the federal
army, accusing both of bringing Yugoslavia to the verge of disintegration
and civil war.
He also criticised western governments, in particular Britain, for
supporting what he termed, 'the Yugoslav state, which is historically
ill-conceived.'
Mr Tudjman, who made his remarks last night at the conservative Centre for
Policy Studies during a 12-hour trip to London, said Croatia would continue
to uphold its independence and would defend itself against any intervention.
'I did not call the people (of Croatia) to rise up against the army. But if
the army attacked the Croatian people, then they should defend themselves,'
Mr Tudjman explained, countering allegations that he encouraged Croats to
protect the republic against the army.
A soldier was killed in the Croatian port of Split when thousands of angry
Croat demonstrators stormed the army headquarters on Monday.
Denying that the Croats has been responsible for that incident, Mr Tudjman
said: 'They were provoked by Serbs.'
Mr Tudjman, who was sworn in as president last year following the victory of
the right-wing Croatian Democratic Union Party in free elections, singled
out Mr Blagole Adzic, the army's chief of staff, as the bete noire of
democrats.
The army, he said, was divided between those senior officers who perceived
the role of the military as the people's army of Yugoslavia, and those, like
General Adzic, who wanted to maintain 'Serbian hegemony.'
'Two-thirds of the army officers are now Serb,' said Mr Tudjman. Yet despite
his sharp criticism, he still believed 'the army will not intervene.'
However, his unremitting criticism of the Serbs - whom he described as
representing 'another world and another civilisation from the Croats' -
implied that any dialogue between Yugoslavia's two largest ethnic groups and
republics, was impossible to imagine.
Moreover, he said the division of Yugoslavia between the western, and
Catholic, republics of Slovenia and Croatia which had been ruled by the
Habsburgs, and the eastern, Orthodox and Moslem republics of Serbia,
Macedonia and Montenegro, which had been under Turkish domination,
heightened the sense of the artificiality of 'Yugoslav statehood.'

<TEXT>
INDUSTRY agreement on a European Community strategy for high-definition
television (HDTV) may be more fragile than the European Commission has
suggested, according to EC satellite operators and broadcasters.
Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the technology commissioner, claimed last month
that broadcasters, satellite operators and the electronics industry had
reached 'agreement in principle' on an EC strategy.
Yesterday the five commissioners responsible for audiovisual policy debated
the framework for a consortium which would promote wide-screen HDTV services
in Europe. This consensus approach would be combined with new European
legislation which the Commission wants to put to telecommunications
ministers next month.
Although progress has been made by feuding industry factions, participants
say important hurdles remain. 'There is a reasonably high degree of optimism
that on Monday (when interest groups meet for more discussions on the issue)
we will be in a position to make some significant further progress,' said
one broadcaster yesterday. 'But it isn't correct to say that the deal is
done.'
In particular, broadcasters and satellite operators like Societe Europeenne
des Satellites, which runs the Astra satellite used by British Sky
Broadcasting, are worried that the Pal standard they use will be phased out
in favour of an intermediate HDTV standard, D2-Mac.
Satellite groups and commercial broadcasters prefer the option of
simultaneous broadcasting in Pal and D2-Mac, leading to the eventual
introduction of a full HDTV standard, known as HD-Mac.
However, electronics groups such as Thomson of France, which has invested
heavily in HDTV technology, are concerned that simultaneous broadcasting may
lead to technical problems with satellite capacity.
Last month's drafts of the framework for establishing a consortium suggested
interest groups had agreed 'the D2-Mac standard offers the best path towards
the development of HDTV with (wide-screen) D2-Mac as the main step in that
direction'.
Satellite operators fear that if they sign such an agreement, commissioners
will interpret it as a mandate to introduce compulsory D2-Mac in the draft
HDTV directive.
Attempts are being made to revive Eurosport, the satellite television sports
channel that went off the air yesterday, writes Raymond Snoddy. It collapsed
after attempts to find Pounds 60m from new investors failed before last
Friday's deadline. The Eurosport consortium brought together 17 of Europe's
public service broadcasters.
Mr Alan Hart, Eurosport chairman, said yesterday that there was still a
consortium 'and we will do all we can to keep the concept alive'.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Azerbaijan accuses Armenia of waging war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Soviet republic of Azerbaijan yesterday accused Armenian nationalists of
'waging an undeclared war' and said guerrillas had killed 65 Azerbaijanis
before a Soviet army clampdown last week.
In a statement carried by the official news agency Tass, the Azerbaijani
Foreign Ministry warned Armenia's leadership that it would have to carry
'full responsibility' for any further aggression.
The statement, which came a day after Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
defended the use of troops against Armenian villages inside Azerbaijan,
continued: 'Further hostilities against Azerbaijan will produce a
catastrophe.'
It stated that between April 28 and May 3, Armenian guerrillas had shelled
or opened fire on more than 30 Azerbaijani villages and the towns of Shusha
and Kazakh.
Armenia, meanwhile, yesterday accused President Gorbachev and the Kremlin of
unleashing a campaign of state terrorism to topple the republic's elected
nationalist government.
Mr Levon Ter-Petrosyan, Armenian president, said military operations,
including attacks by helicopters and armoured vehicles, were continuing
against isolated Armenian villages. He said dozens had been killed.
Police from Azerbaijan were also taking part in the attacks, he said.
The Soviet leadership blames armed Armenian nationalist groups for the
violence and insist they be disarmed.
Mr Ter-Petrosyan quoted witness who were reported as saying that combined
Soviet and Azerbaijani forces had committed atrocities against Armenians in
the border region, including the shooting of prisoners and the scalping of
dead bodies.
The allegations were impossible to corroborate from independent sources.
'President Gorbachev says these actions are only intended to neutralise
armed (Armenian) groups. But he has another goal,' a subdued Mr
Ter-Petrosyan told a news conference.
Mr Gorbachev wanted 'to terrorise the Armenian people and overthrow the
legally-elected powers in Armenia.'

<TEXT>
THE European Commission has taken the exceptional decision to approve state
aid for a programme of investments by a Greek steel company, part of a shoal
of small state aid cases passed by Brussels yesterday, writes Andrew Hill in
Brussels.
Investment aid is normally forbidden in the steel sector, because it might
increase capacity in a sector where the aim has been to limit EC production.
However, investment aid targeted on a particular region, and which does not
increase capacity, is allowed.
Greece is the only member state to meet all the conditions applied to such
aid and the Commission estimated that the aid to Halyvourgia Thessalias
would not increase the company's production capacity.
Brussels has also allowed France to renew for a further five years its tax
on the clothing industry, aimed principally at raising money for research
and training. The tax, which has existed since 1986, makes up 35 per cent of
the annual resources of the Committee for Development and Promotion of the
Textile and Clothing Industry, up to a figure of FFr57m (Pounds 5.7m).
Sir Leon Brittan, the responsible commissioner, has also approved the
renewal of a three-year aid programme for the Dutch shipbuilding industry,
which falls under the 1990 shipbuilding directive; aid for research and
development in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany; and German aid for riverside
agricultural areas.
The Commission has waved through three deals in the Italian and German steel
industries: a merger between Stinnes Stahlhandel and Josef Stangl
Eisengrosshandlung und Biegerei; a takeover of Industrie Cantieri
Metallurgici Italiani by Ilva of Italy; and the formation of a joint-venture
vehicle by Klockner Stahl, Agais Stahlhandel and Rautaruukkl of Germany.

STRIKING ground staff and cabin crews yesterday forced the cancellation of

Spain's public sector companies, writes Tom Burns in Madrid.
Industrial action over the next two weeks is expected to spread to the

state-controlled shipbuilding and aerospace industries, and to the publicly
owned gas companies which are all currently involved in annual wage

The Iberia strike, the first of four 24-hour stoppages planned at the

increases this year. The company lost Pta22.5bn (Pounds 123.6m) last year.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Gonzalez warns UK of shadow cast by Gibraltar impasse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A 'desirable easy relationship' between Britain and Spain will be difficult
to establish as long as the Gibraltar problem remains unsolved, Mr Felipe
Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, warned last night in London.
The premier said at a dinner in his honour at No 10 Downing Street that
'bilateral, as well as Community and multilateral relations are affected by
this problem, a hold-over from history'.
Mr Gonzalez recognised that the opinion of Gibraltarians had to be
considered in any solution but he appealed to the British government not to
take only their wishes into account.
'Perhaps it is up to the UK, in view of its special relationship with its
colony, to make an effort of imagination. We are willing, as always, to help
in this task,' he said.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Gonzalez, who is paying
the first official visit to Britain by a Spanish premier since General
Franco died in 1975, had earlier held talks on mainly European Community
problems.
Their talks were described by Mr Major as 'very friendly and constructive'.
They had discussed at some length the proposal for European economic and
monetary union: the British and Spanish proposals for a hard Ecu, or a
hardening of the Ecu basket, were similar, Mr Major said.
'We have neither of us given specific support to the other's proposal, but
we are very close on the principles of how we must go ahead on economic and
monetary union (Emu).'
In his speech at No 10, Mr Gonzalez underlined the need for careful planning
of Emu and warned against pushing ahead too fast, which would 'endanger the
final result'. He also stressed that economic and monetary union must be
complemented by a common foreign and security policy.
David Gardner adds from Brussels: Spain's call for an equalising budgetary
fund to redistribute wealth towards the EC's four poorest members could lead
to failure of the current negotiations on economic, monetary and political
union.
This was the clear message from five of Madrid's partners at this week's
meeting of the intergovernmental conference on political union.
Delegates from the Netherlands, the UK, France, Germany and Denmark told
their Spanish colleagues that if they made their support for EMU and
political union conditional on more cash to help the poorest nations catch
up, then the negotiations on treaty changes would founder.
Unanimous agreement is required for such changes.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Labour's tax plans attacked by Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRUGGLE to map out a new political battleground began in earnest
yesterday as Mr John Major attacked Labour's tax plans and his opponents
homed in on voters' concerns over the National Health Service.
With their poor showing at the local elections and the poll tax controversy
fading in voters' minds, the Tories are seeking to regain the initiative by
highlighting Labour's tax and spending proposals.
In contrast, Labour wants to shift the electorate's attention to
unemployment and a widely perceived decline in health, education and other
social services.
Evidence of the parties' new priorities came in Commons question-time
yesterday.
Mr Major sought to draw attention to Labour's promise to end the ceiling on
national insurance contributions and to raise top income tax rates to 50 per
cent. He also delivered a side-swipe to the Liberal Democrats by rejecting
voting reform and obliquely dismissing a tax-raising assembly for Scotland.
In a vigorous counter-attack, Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, attempted
to put the health service at the centre of debate. Citing a Watford
hospital, he said the NHS reforms were creating an unethical 'two-tier'
service whereby general practitioners who had opted to take control of their
budgets were getting preferential treatment for their patients.
Mr Major denied the claim, saying operations were being conducted on a basis
of need.
Both main parties are gearing up for a summer of campaigning conducted
against a background of speculation over an autumn general election.
While the Conservatives are anxious to regain the initiative, party
officials are nervous of stepping up their fight-back before next week's
Monmouth by-election where a 9,000 vote majority is under threat.
In his Commons' answers, Mr Major said Labour's policies on tax and spending
proposals would be costed and the findings presented to voters.
Anticipating further attacks, Labour officials were last night outlining the
contents of a speech to be given by Mr Kinnock in London today challenging
the Tories to explain how they will both reduce taxes and raise the
standards of social services.
By increasing top rate tax and foregoing tax cuts, Labour would have Pounds
20bn in the course of a parliament to restore funding, he will tell a
conference of health and community care workers.
While Mr Kinnock ruled out tax cuts, Labour officials made clear that this
did not exclude raising tax allowances to exempt the lowest paid from the
tax net.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Elf and Enterprise may bid for Occidental's UK assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELF AQUITAINE, the French oil and chemicals group, and Enterprise Oil, the
British independent exploration and production company, are expected to
announce a joint venture agreement today to buy the North Sea assets of
Occidental Petroleum, the US oil company, for some Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds
813m).
The expected deal is believed to make provision for Enterprise to acquire
the 25 per cent of its shares owned by Elf - possibly by swapping some of
its existing assets for the shares.
Elf has been widely rumoured for several weeks to be close to securing the
purchase of Occidental's assets in an auction where it has been competing
against Enterprise and Arco, the US oil operator.
The co-operation of Elf and Enterprise in a bid is likely to make the deal
more palatable to Mr Peter Lilley, the UK industry secretary, who referred
Elf's last British acquisition to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
because of the French government's 55.6 per cent stake in the company.
The commission cleared Elf's purchase of Amoco's UK petrol stations last
week.
Occidental's North Sea business includes operating the Piper field where 167
men were killed in an explosion on the Piper Alpha oil rig three years ago.
The majority ownership of this field could prove a sensitive political issue
which Enterprise's involvement could help to diffuse.
Occidental has spent some Pounds 550m re-developing the Piper Alpha
platform, but no longer regards its North Sea business as a core operation.
It has been trying to sell the UK assets in an attempt to reduce debt in the
US parent.
The Occidental assets cover a broad spread of business in the North Sea
which would fit well with both Elf and Enterprise's acquisitive strategies.
Enterprise needs experience in operating a UK field to aid its overseas
expansion and prepare it to take over the running of its Nelson field when
that comes on stream later this decade. Enterprise also needs cash flow to
develop the Nelson field, of which it owns 60 per cent and which is expected
to cost Pounds 1.25bn over the next five years.
An asset swap - could improve the independent company's cash position, but
only if it can be done in a way that will avoid a large Advanced Corporation
Tax liability.
Some analysts are speculating that Enterprise will make a rights issue to
help fund the asset purchase.
None of the companies involved would comment.

YUGOSLAVIA'S federal army mobilised yesterday amid signs that ethnic unrest
was spreading from Croatia to other republics.
Reservists were called up in Serbia and tanks were deployed to guard three
bridges on the Danube river between Croatia and Serbia.
The country's civilian leadership, meanwhile, remained deadlocked on whether
to impose a state of emergency in an attempt to restore stability and
contain ethnic conflicts. It said it would continue its talks today.
Mr Ante Markovic, the prime minister, and Mr Veljko Kadijevic, defence
minister, attended yesterday's inconclusive session of the presidency, the
country's collective head of state.
Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia and a critic of the army's role,
had talks with Mr Markovic on Monday night and flew to London yesterday.
He met Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, who said he hoped a
political solution could be found to keep Yugoslavia together as an entity.
The two western republics of Slovenia and Croatia oppose any imposition of a
state of emergency, while Serbia, and the army, want to deploy more military
forces in Croatia.
Thirteen Croat policeman were killed last Thursday, reportedly by rebel
Serbs.
Yesterday's stalemate means that violence between Serbs and Croats, which
has claimed 18 lives in the past week, threatens to continue unabated.
Peasants in Listica, a predominantly Croatian region in Bosnia-Hercegovina,
put up barricades to stop army tanks and troops from passing through. Local
politicians said Listica would rise up to defend Croatia if the republic was
attacked by the army.
The spectre of ethnic conflicts spilling over to Bosnia would have a rapid
destabilising affect on its population which is a delicate balance of Moslem
Slavs, Orthodox Serbs and Roman Catholic Croats.
Any sign of more intervention by the army in Croatia is also likely to
infuriate the Croats, who regard the federal army as pro-Serbian.
Yesterday, Croatian workers occupied an arms factory in the town of
Slavonski Brod in central Croatia. The workers tried to prevent the army
from removing 100 new tanks from the factory.
Mr Kadijevic said on Monday the army would intervene to stop ethnic clashes
and would no longer tolerate anti-army activity. The army's toughened stance
followed the killing by a Croat policeman of a soldier during anti-army
demonstrations on Monday in Split, Croatia's second biggest city.
There were calls for a peaceful resolution from Cardinal Franjo Kuharic, the
primate of Croatia, and Serbia's Orthodox Patriarch, Pavle.
Serbia's opposition coalition yesterday accused Mr Tudjman and Mr Slobodan
Milosevic, the republic's president, of 'mobilising fear among Croats and
Serbs' and called for an anti-war demonstration tomorrow in Belgrade.
Observers in Belgrade say the crisis in Croatia plays into the hands of Mr
Milosevic. Serbia's leadership is using the crisis to demand military rule
in Yugoslavia, which would stop Mr Stipe Mesic, Croatia's representative to
the eight-member presidency, from becoming the president of Yugoslavia next
Wednesday under its rotating system.
In London, Mr Hurd told Mr Tudjman that violence was not an answer to
Yugoslavia's problems, and that he supported the view that the country's
constitution, particularly the provisions referring to a rotating
presidency, should be respected.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Banks set for court fight over councils' swap deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHTY banks facing losses of Pounds 550m over interest rate swap agreements
with 130 UK local authorities are set to pursue their claims in court after
a government decision yesterday not to intervene.
The government resisted pressure from banks, the City, and the Bank of
England to overturn a House of Lords ruling earlier this year that the swap
agreements entered into by the councils were illegal.
The swaps involved councils exchanging their interest obligations, normally
from fixed to floating rate, in the expectation that rates would fall.
Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, said in a written Commons
answer yesterday that the government would not 'seek to alter existing legal
obligations'.
The banks could recover around Pounds 125m through restitution actions to
retrieve sums paid to the councils. Separately, they can reclaim corporation
tax of 35 per cent on the losses.
Mr John Maples, economic secretary to the Treasury, referring to the
decision yesterday, said that 'all courses were very unattractive on the
grounds of both principle and practice'. The government had considered
retrospective validation of the contracts and mandatory restitution. The
decision not to legislate was seen as 'the least unattractive of the
solutions open to us'.
So far, 12 banks have issued 69 writs against 32 local authorities,
according to Ms Irene Dorner, head of the banks' steering committee dealing
with the swaps issue. But many have yet to be served, as banks had been
hoping that the existing situation would not be allowed to stand.
Ms Dorner said the number of cases actually likely to go to court would be
'very unpredictable, but potentially very large'. However, she added that
out-of-court settlement 'must be a more sensible approach'.
Mr Cliff Nicholson, deputy controller of the Audit Commission, which brought
the original test case against Hammersmith and Fulham council, agreed it was
time for the banks and councils to 'do deals. There has been enough
litigation'.
So far, two cases have been settled out of court: Ogwr Borough Council in
South Wales paid Citicorp Investment Bank more than Pounds 1m, and
Hammersmith and Fulham settled with one of the banks involved.
The Bank of England, which had backed the banks' case for action, was
disappointed but appreciated that the government faced a difficult decision.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, president of the British Bankers Association,
described the decision as 'very regrettable'.
He added that the decision would cause 'great long-term damage to London's
standing in the international financial markets.'

FT  08 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE futures led the share market higher as a squeeze built up in the
derivative markets. Otherwise it was a painfully slow day's trading with a
lack of institutional and retail interest.
The June FT-SE 100 index moved to a premium to the spot index of 27 points
at one stage as futures traders attempted to cover short positions built up
the previous week.
With fair value (the futures markets' theoretical premium) at just 15
points, there was a small amount of arbitraging between the futures and cash
markets. This pushed the stock market higher, although towards the close
another squeeze developed with June moving briskly ahead.
June FT-SE closed up 28 points at 2,566, while its premium stood at 29
against 15 at the previous close. The doubling in the futures' premium is a
sign of the market's belief that the immediate outlook for shares is
positive.
While the lack of institutional interest continues to cast doubt on how
soundly based another rally would be, the prospect of further cuts in
interest rates has encouraged the bulls.
Turnover in Allied-Lyons traded options was boosted by continuing bid
speculation, with call buyers in evidence. Total options turnover was
slightly higher at 18,831.

FT  08 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Corporate initiatives move
individual share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANY NEWS moved individual share prices, but left bourses mostly short of
inspiration yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
AMSTERDAM saw Hagemeyer and Internatio Muller suspended at Monday's closing
prices of Fl 122.30 and Fl 77, before Hong Kong's First Pacific revealed
that it had a 43.2 per cent stake in Internatio, and planned to merge it
with Hagemeyer of which First Pacific owns 60 per cent.
Internatio thwarted the takeover attempt by issuing 5.6m preference shares,
but dealers were encouraged that investors were prepared to be aggressive in
the face of Amsterdam's anti-takeover defences.
Volker Stevin fell Fl 8, or nearly 10 per cent to Fl 74 following Monday's
news that its fellow builder, HBG, will sell its stake of around 60 per cent
and be allowed to buy Volker's dredging business. HGB jumped Fl 7.30 to Fl
220.30.
Buhrmann Tetterode fell Fl 3.90 to Fl 56.70 on lower profits for the first
quarter of 1991, and the lack of improvement in prospect for the rest of the
year. The CBS Tendency index fell 0.5 to 94.6 in thin trading.
FRANKFURT remained subdued. Volume only rose from DM3.6bn to DM4.2bn; the
FAZ index by 1.08 to 690.08; and the DAX by 3.47 to 1,627.46.
A 5 per cent decline in Bayer's first quarter profits left the shares DM1.40
higher at DM282.70 while BASF, with profits down 25 per cent at the same
stage on Monday, slid another DM2.70 to DM247.50 for a two-day fall of
DM7.20.
Mr Reinhardt Fischer, who heads Europe ex-UK research, and the German team
at Paribas Capital Markets, said that Bayer's results were as expected but
that they underlined the company's better balanced, and more diversified
product range vis-a-vis BASF.
Just back from Germany, he said that sentiment was turning slowly for the
better. The market is looking increasingly at an improving 1992 earnings
prospect rather than the decline of 1991; in combination with improving
industrial investment intentions, this is leaving the outlook much less
gloomy than it was.
Meanwhile SEL, the telecoms company owned 86 per cent by the French Alcatel
group, fell DM23, or 6 per cent to DM350 as it passed the 1990 dividend on
virtually non-existent profits.
OSLO rose sharply, as falling interest rates, a rising oil price and
optimism about the economy combined to outweigh worries about tax reforms.
The all-share index gained 12.44 or 2.5 per cent to 501.27, passing the 500
level for the first time since March. Turnover grew to NKr517m from NKr302m.
One analyst said that Norway had underperformed this year in spite of the
relative strength of the economy, because domestic institutions had been
sitting on cash. Yesterday's rise suggested that they could be back in the
market.
Norsk Hydro, regarded as a proxy for the market, gained NKr6 to NKr190.5.
Aker rose NKr4 to NKr109 after announcing the purchase of a US marine
engineering company.
STOCKHOLM saw Ericsson weaken ahead of the publication of its first-quarter
earnings. The free B shares lost SKr2 to SKr189. After hours Ericsson said
profit had fallen 14 per cent, at the low end of market expectations.
Trading in the share accounted for SKr22m of the total SKr343m. The
Affarsvarlden General index fell 1.0 to 1,041.9.
COPENHAGEN rose on a larger than expected Danish trade surplus in March, the
CSE index adding another 1.03 to 350.34. DDL, which owns two-sevenths of
Scandinavian Airlines, rose DKr100 to DKr2,730 on talk that SAS might sell
part of its stakes in Continental Airlines, and the Chilean airline, Lan
Chile.
MADRID's general index rose 1.36 to 280.04 in turnover of about Pta10bn,
down from Pta11bn.
Focsa was suspended at Monday's closing price of Pta14,700. The construction
company, owned by the Koplowitz sisters, is to be merged with the sisters'
Construcciones y Contratas (Conycon) - a move that one analyst said made
strategic sense.
MILAN fell in thin trading on fears that the new government could come
unstuck over budget discussions. The Comit index fell 4.21 to 581.69 in
turnover estimated at below Monday's L125bn.
Fiat fell back after Monday's rally on hopes that the 1990 dividend would be
maintained. The stock was weighed down by news that its domestic new car
deliveries fell 15.5 per cent in April, and 16.3 per cent in the first four
months. Fiat closed L47 lower at L5,399.
Cir, Mr Carlo De Benedetti's holding company, lost only L11 to L2,749 in
spite of a cut in dividend and a sharp drop in 1990 results. The share is
being supported by relief that the long battle for the publisher Mondadori
has ended.
PARIS approached two days of holidays in a quiet mood, with the CAC 40 index
up 1.41 at 1,830.18. Rhone-Poulenc investment certificates gained FFr7.80 to
FFr379.80 after Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, its US arm, announced first-quarter
results, a higher dividend and a two-for-one stock split.
Takeover speculation focused on CSEE, the electronics equipment company,
which jumped FFr17.10 or 7.3 per cent to FFr252 on 208,630 shares - or 23
per cent of the company's capital - including one block of 156,080 at FFr260
each.
Carrefour, the supermarket chain, rose FFr48 or 2.5 per cent to FFr1,995
after reporting better-than-expected four-month sales. CCF lost FFr4.70 or
2.8 per cent to FFr165. The bank said that economic conditions were too
uncertain to make a 1991 forecast.

FT  08 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei slips in lowest
volume since January
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo
FADING HOPES of an early cut in interest rates and a lack of institutional
interest after the Golden Week holidays pushed share prices lower yesterday
in the thinnest turnover since late-January, agencies report from Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 135.72 lower at 26,342.14. The index reached the
day's high of 26,523.62 at the start of trading, but then declined to a low
of 26,326.36, only to recover slightly on some late buying by bargain
hunters and arbitrageurs. The market was closed on Friday and Monday.
The broader first section Topix index was down 4.78 at 1,996.71, but the
second section index rose 14.41 to 3,389.04. Only 220m shares changed hands,
against 380m last Thursday, the lowest since 200m was traded on January 28.
Declining issues outpaced gains by 576 to 348, while 195 stocks were
unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.51 to 1,505.80.
In addition to an absence of buying incentives, the yen's decline against
the dollar and weakness in the domestic bond market were blamed for the
subdued post-holiday session.
Most construction shares retreated and large-capital steels also fared
badly. Kawasaki Steel fell Y7 to Y443 and Nippon Steel lost Y5 to Y474.
Some precision machinery manufacturers enjoyed heavy turnover on
expectations of improving business. Nikon rose Y50 to Y1,430, Olympus put on
Y50 to Y1,210 and Lintec Corp jumped Y360 to Y2,780, although Dainippon
Screen shed Y10 to Y1,680. Sharp was the day's most actively traded share
and gained Y40 to Y1,620.
Asatsu was bid-only for most of the first trading day since it lowered its
trading unit from 1,000 to 100 shares; just before the close it stood at
Y7,990. It was suspended at Y6,990 on April 23 in preparation for the
change.
Sanrio fell Y490 to Y3,500 on reports that the company's new theme park
could wipe out its group profits. A Sanrio spokesman declined to comment
before the release of results this month.
In Osaka, the index receded 51.45 to 29,360.71 on volume of 22.5m shares.
Roundup
CORPORATE and political news sent Asia Pacific markets in opposite
directions, with the best rise in the Philippines.
MANILA jumped 4.4 per cent, with Ayala Corp, the property group, leading
gains. The market was initially encouraged by President Corazon Aquino's
strong stand on the US military bases.
Ayala 'A' shares added 3.5 pesos at 43 pesos after a good first-quarter
performance and before news of its dividend payment. The composite index
climbed 46.19 to 1,100.89.
BANGKOK dropped 3.2 per cent on political worries following the lifting of
martial law last Thursday. The market was shut on Monday. The SET index fell
27.94 to 840.06 in thin turnover of 2.8bn baht.
NEW ZEALAND continued to see demand for Brierley Investments (BIL), the
investment and trading group. The Barclays index gained 1.7 per cent for the
second successive day, adding 26.53 at 1,579.75. Turnover, at NZDollars
21.4m, was similar to Monday's NZDollars 21.9m.
Brierley, which appreciated 10 cents the previous day, was 7 cents higher at
NZDollars 1.27 on volume of 3.3m shares. On Monday the company said it had
sold part of its stake in the Mount Charlotte hotels group for NZDollars
660m to two Singapore government agencies, which had also taken a 4.7 per
cent holding in BIL for NZDollars 126m.
Interest revived in Carter Holt Harvey, which is 21 per cent owned by
Brierley and has lagged behind other leading stocks because of its high debt
level. The stock advanced 9 cents to NZDollars 2.03. Another laggard,
Magnum, the retail and brewing company in which Brierley jointly holds 54
per cent, rose 8 cents to NZDollars 2.80.
HONG KONG gained 1 per cent on rumours that Evergo, with the backing of
Cheung Kong, was planning a hostile bid for Hongkong Land. The Hang Seng
index moved ahead 37.08 to 3,741.51, but turnover decreased to HKDollars
1.12bn from HKDollars 1.46bn.
Hongkong Land picked up 35 cents to HKDollars 8.55 and Evergo improved 15
cents to HKDollars 3.50, while Cheung Kong recovered 20 cents to HKDollars
18.20 after falling 50 cents on Monday after a warrant issue.
AUSTRALIA rose, mostly on foreign buying. The All Ordinaries index gained
15.3 to 1,537.8 in turnover of ADollars 180m, down from ADollars 187m.
CRA slipped 10 cents to ADollars 13.10 after announcing a decline in 1990
profits and forecasting another fall for 1991.
TAIWAN gained further ground. The weighted index added 60.48 at 6,172.57 in
turnover little changed at TDollars 90.4bn.
Hualon, the textile maker, advanced TDollars 4 to TDollars 64 after the
release on bail at the weekend of the company's chairman.
SEOUL fell sharply for a fourth session, as political tensions grew.
Disappointment with government market-boosting measures also depressed
sentiment. The composite index lost 5.45 to 635.17.

FT  08 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets: Japan helps to foster global recovery

<TEXT>
PUBLIC HOLIDAYS left volume subdued last week, but share prices moved higher
after their losses of the week before.
The FT-Actuaries World Index recovered 1.2 per cent in local currency terms,
with most of its lift coming from Tokyo, where the Golden Week holidays
coincided with a surprise cut in the US Federal Reserve discount rate from 6
to 5.5 per cent. The market has recently seen particular strength in
over-the-counter and other smaller companies.
In the US, equities were relatively depressed. The week started with
encouraging economic data, but share prices failed to sustain their response
to that, or to Tuesday's interest rate reduction; the US market ended flat
on mixed unemployment figures and weak car sales.
Europe saw the best of its recovery in France and most of that last
Thursday, with a 2.5 per cent climb in the CAC 40 index after the interest
rate cuts in the US and a rise in the bond market in Paris. Writing at the
end of the week, Morgan Stanley made France its preferred market among the
European majors.
New Zealand was the best performing market of the week. Like Paris it had
one big day, in its case last Friday when it advanced 2.7 per cent; once
again, this was partly founded on a continuing rally in the domestic bond
market, in New Zealand's case after news that the country's current account
deficit would be revised sharply downwards.
Mr Mike Gilmour of brokers Ord Minnett said yesterday that New Zealand, long
depressed, had seen the first indications of domestic equity buying for some
time. There had been heavy overseas buying for the past week or two,
attributed mostly to the US.
The other strong performer in the Asia Pacific region was Hong Kong, up 2.6
per cent. Apart from the US interest rate news, says Hoare Govett, the
market rallied on an announcement that airport talks would recommence, and
on signs that the US would renew China's most favoured nation status.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Money Markets: Slightly softer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST RATES had a slightly easier tone on the London money market
yesterday. Trading was quiet, lacking fresh factors, but the important
three-month sterling interbank rate continued to point towards a cut of  1/2
point in UK bank base rates.
Three-month interbank was quoted at 11 9/16 -11 1/2 per cent, compared with
11 5/8 -11 1/2 previously, while 12-month money was unchanged at 11 1/4 -11
1/8 per cent.
Prices of short sterling futures were firmer on Liffe.
June delivery opened higher at 88.80 and closed at 88.87, against 88.78 on
Friday, discounting an offered rate of about 11 1/8 per cent for three-month
cash at delivery.
Credit remained in very short supply on the money market. The Bank of
England initially forecast a day-to-day shortage of Pounds 1,400m, but
revised this to Pounds 1,600m at noon and to Pounds 1,550m in the afternoon.
Total assistance of Pounds 1,544m was provided.
An early round of help was offered and at that time the authorities bought
Pounds 320m bank bills outright in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Before lunch
another Pounds 665m bills were purchased, by way of Pounds 71m bank bills in
band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 594m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16
per cent.
In the afternoon the Bank of England bought Pounds 249m bills, via Pounds 7m
Treasury bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 242m bank bills in
band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent. Late assistance of around Pounds 310n was also
provided.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 1,598m, with exchequer transactions
absorbing Pounds 180m and bank balances below target Pounds 130m. These
outweighed a fall in the note circulation adding Pounds 510m to liquidity.
In Frankfurt call money was steady at 8.85 per cent after the Bundesbank
offered liquidity via a 35-day securities repurchase agreement at an
unchanged fixed rate of 8.60 per cent. This will be required to replace an
earlier agreement of DM23.7bn expiring today.
In Brussels the Belgian National Bank cut its seven-day advances rate to
8.75 from 8.80 per cent, following a slight widening of Belgium's interest
rate advantage over Germany and the strong position of the Belgian franc in
the ERM.
In Amsterdam the Dutch Central Bank left its special advances rate at 8.70
per cent at a tender for seven-day money.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Setting out to build a republic
on bananas - Tim Coone describes Nicaragua's transforming interest in
plantations and investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING the late 1980s, when the left-wing Sandinista party's grip on power
in Nicaragua began to slip, one of the country's several conservative
parties sponsored a billboard in the capital, announcing that 'Nicaragua
will once again become a republic'. Some comic immediately painted in
'banana' before the word republic.
The anonymous graffiti writer may soon be proved correct, although the new
republic will not be one of bemedalled generals in dark glasses, being
financed by shady, foreign 'banana company men'.
The government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro this month passed a
new decree which will allow the return of foreign investors in the banana
business after a decade of absence from Nicaragua. New investors, as well as
the traditional banana transnationals such as Standard Fruit and United
Brands, are being invited to establish plantations.
The private Nicaraguan growers see in the decree an ideal opportunity to
transform Nicaragua's poor export performance, and in the process to make an
almost infallible investment in what has become a booming world banana
market.
Mr Ramiro Gurdian, a plantation owner and president of the farmer's
association Upanic, said that 'it is one of the agro-export sectors which
gives the quickest return on investment and shows a rapid result on the
balance of payments'. Banana plantations, once sown, produce their first
harvest within a year.
Nicaragua stopped being a major banana producer when Panama disease wiped
out the country's principal plantations on the Caribbean coast in the 1930s.
The US transnational Standard Fruit Company had purchasing contracts on the
Pacific coast with local growers such as Mr Gurdian until the 1979
revolution. From there, they supplied the US West Coast market. As Mr
Gurdian pointed out, Nicaragua is the closest point in Latin America to the
US West Coast, which has the appropriate soils and climate for banana
production.
The Sandinistas and Standard Fruit quickly fell out. Unions were legalised.
The banana export trade was nationalised and placed in the hands of the
state-run company Embanic. A decree was issued by former President Daniel
Ortega, giving Embanic a monopoly on any future banana production for
export.
A price war began in the California market to try to exclude Nicaraguan
produce. A 1985 US trade embargo then halted exports altogether.
Embanic successfully redirected fruit to the European market, although
higher transport costs cut deeply into its profits.
The growers and Embanic survived, and Nicaraguan exports are expected to
reach 6-7m boxes this year, once again returning to the levels of the
mid-70s.
Mr Gurdian is confident of further expansion as a result of the new decree.
A new foreign investment law, permitting the unrestricted repatriation of
profits generated from export earnings, has been passed. Mr Gurdian said:
'We are looking ahead to the creation of the unified market in Europe in
1993'. The market in Eastern Europe has also provided new opportunities.
Nicaraguan produce is already going to Poland, through Embanic's independent
intermediaries in Belgium.
Mr Gurdian is doubling his plantations from 120 to 240 hectares this year.
He said that he and the 15 other private growers in Nicaragua 'don't mind
the transnationals coming back. We welcome their presence'. It is unlikely
that he will be selling to them in the future.
He explained that Nicaraguan farmers, with the Colombian private growers'
association Proban, are sending a weekly shipment to Belgium through their
own outlets inedependently of the large transnationals. Five reefer vessels
are chartered.
In 1975, the price paid by Standard Fruit to local growers was only
USDollars 0.75 per 40lb box. Last year, Nicaraguan growers were selling
their produce at an average of USDollars 11 per box, cif in Belgium through
Embanic. Even accounting for insurance and freight in the latter figure,
returns to growers are some ten times higher than 15 years ago.
Mr Gurdian said that the US companies will be looking primarily to supply
the US West Coast market again. 'We don't want to enter into battle with
them' he said.
Only 2,600 hectares are presently planted to bananas in Nicaragua, an area
10-20 per cent of neighbouring Costa Rica or Honduras.
At some USDollars 15,000 per hectare to establish a plantation on the
Pacific coast, banana production is capital intensive.
Nicaragua's remote and poverty-stricken Caribbean coast, offering a shorter
route to the European market, would be even more expensive. This route would
require finance on a scale which only large foreign companies or banks could
muster.
It is thus a born-again 'banana republic' that is sprouting new roots in
Nicaragua. It is one without thumbscrews or wheezy military bands, but one
with new laws and ethics, attuned to the restructuring of the world's banana
trade and the new democratic thinking in Latin America.

<TEXT>
THE JOINT venturers in Australia's Argyle diamond mine, CRA and Ashton
Mining, are poised to sign a new five-year agreement with South Africa's De
Beers to market the Argyle stones through the Central Selling Organisation.
CRA and Ashton have already signed heads of agreement with the Swiss arm of
the South African group, De Beers Centenary AG.
A joint statement which was issued yesterday by CRA, Ashton and De Beers
said that details were being finalised but that outstanding matters were
expected to be resolved quickly.
The major change to the CSO's marketing of Argyle diamonds since the
Australian group began supplying diamonds to the South Africans eight years
ago is that the entitlement of the third shareholder, the West Australian
Diamond Trust, which had been sold separately, will now go through the CSO.
WADT is 97 per cent owned by CRA and Ashton and has been managed by Ashton
since October, 1989.
CRA owns 56.8 per cent of Argyle, Ashton owns 38.2 per cent and WADT owns
five per cent.
In exchange for selling more of the diamond output through CSO, the Argyle
partners will keep more of the high value gem stone quality, white and
coloured stones, for sale through Argyle Diamond Sales. Argyle Diamond Sales
is a company which is owned proportionately by the joint venturers.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Business and the Environment: The danger of being left out -
Judy Dempsey and Ariane Genillard continue an occasional series on cleaning
up eastern Europe by examining Bulgaria's obstacles to change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a cool February day in 1989 Grisha Filipov, former communist prime
minister of Bulgaria, stood on the balcony of the local communist party
headquarters in Ruse.
Once a thriving merchant centre under the Habsburgs but now a shabby and
delapidated city, Ruse is built on the river Danube and divides Bulgaria
from Romania.
Filipov, in his customary, condescending fashion, waved to the crowds. He
tried to reassure them that the chlorine fumes wafting across the Danube
from a chemical factory in the Romanian town of Giurgiu were harmless. The
crowds were too cynical to believe anything told them by this veteran party
apparatchik.
That day, mothers and their children placed scarves and handkerchiefs over
their faces, not as a sign of defiance to Filipov but to demonstrate the
need to protect themselves from the contaminated air which they breathed.*
For several years, the local population had been subjected to these fumes.
Studies show that over the past 15 years the incidence of lung disease has
increased sharply.
Ruse's inhabitants seemed powerless to do anything, until the arrival in
1989 of the national Independent Committee for the Protection of the
Environment, also known as the Ruse Committee. It joined forces with
Eco-Glasnost, Bulgaria's first national independent environmental movement,
which quickly galvanised public opinion behind it.
The Ruse Committee and Eco-Glasnost formed the beginnings of the country's
first green movement. They soon became a powerful force in Bulgarian
politics. By daring to challenge the monopoly of power held by the ruling
communists, the green movement attracted a broad range of support, and with
it experts who accumulated statistics, carried out studies and placed the
environment high on the country's political agenda.
The facts drawn together by independent experts make grim reading.
Environment minister Dimitar Vodenicharov, who assumed office in January,
says energy generation is the greatest polluter.
Bulgaria's industry is energy-intensive - it relies on brown coal;
Vodenicharov says: 'Between 800,000 and 900,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide
are emitted each year.'
Other industrial activities produce 250,000 tonnes of nitrogen oxide a year
which seep into underground water supplies. Recent reports drawn up by
Eco-Glasnost estimates that about 70 per cent of the country's water is
contaminated.
The catalogue of woes appears unremitting. Some 4.7m hectares of arable
land, or about 44 per cent of the country's territory has been eroded,
polluted, or destroyed because 68m tonnes of dust and toxic gases are
emitted each year.
The coalition government is realising that it will take years - and
considerable sums of money - to tackle the environment, as a recent incident
at the Srednogorie copper factory confirmed. On April 19, 300 tonnes of
sulphuric acid leaked from the factory into the ground. The surrounding
agricultural regions were contaminated and use of the local water supply was
forbidden.
The point about this incident is that the government had temporarily closed
down the factory last year following local protests. But because the factory
was interconnected with so many other enterprises - it supplies 20 of them
with important industrial metals - and because it employs more than 2,000
workers, the authorities were forced to re-open it.
All the other countries of eastern Europe share a similar, if not worse,
fate than Bulgaria. But Bulgaria's large agrarian base tends to act as a
counter-weight to the large-scale programmes of industrialisation undertaken
in the other countries.
That should make the Bulgarian government's task somewhat easier but
officials in Sofia think differently. What concerns them is that this small
Balkan country of 8.9m people will not be able to compete for the interest
already being shown by western governments and investors in Poland, Hungary
and Czechoslovakia.
The response by western consultancy firms advising western governments and
industry about the costs and challenges of cleaning up the environment in
eastern Europe has justified the officials' fears.
'No, we are not yet thinking about working in Bulgaria. It's not high up on
our agenda. We have to obtain a clearer picture,' said one consultant.
The task of collating the data is now being undertaken by the European
Community's Phare programme. In December 1990 it allocated Ecu 3.5m (Pounds
2.4m) to monitor air pollution. Vodenicharov says Phare has already
earmarked Ecu 15m to be spread over two years - from 1990 until the end of
1991 - for the development of a data-gathering agency.
The World Bank, which has already granted Poland an Dollars 18m loan to
strengthen environmental management and provide technical assistance, has
not yet earmarked any finance or credits for Bulgaria's environmental
problems.
'We are sending missions to Bulgaria regularly to gather data. It is too
early to say what kind of programme will emerge from this,' commented a
World Bank official.
The World Bank's recommendations towards cleaning up the environment in
eastern Europe tend initially to focus on the need to reduce the use of
energy.
In a recent study** the World Bank suggested that 'these governments (of
eastern Europe) need to take an active role in promoting environmental
clean-up through altered economic incentives and new public investments'.
It proposed that 'on the incentive side, raising energy prices and imposing
(and rigorously enforcing) reasonable fees and fines on polluters are two
important steps that can be taken early. On the investment side, the needs
are enormous, far beyond the financial resources likely to be available.
'One obvious need is for investment to switch away from coal and towards
natural gas as a major energy source, accompanied by investments to clean up
existing coal-burning facilities and improve the safety of nuclear plans or
in some cases, decommission them . . . '
The Bulgarian government has already embarked on the first phase of economic
reforms, which include the liberalisation of prices, the reduction of the
budget deficit, higher interest rates, a squeeze on consumer spending and
higher energy prices.
Despite these efforts, Vodenicharov believes Bulgaria will remain low on the
economic agenda of western countries. And because Bulgaria is far away from
central Europe, he believes that unless his country makes the effort to lock
into Europe as quickly as possible in order to attract investments for
tackling the environment, cleaning up the country will take a long time.
'Our standards must be European,' explains Vodenicharov, who is clearly
exhausted with trying to keep the environment high on the agenda at a time
when the coffers are empty. He believes, for instance, that closer
co-operation with the Budapest-based Regional Environmental Centre, which
was set up last September, will provide some assistance. He says the centre,
financed by a US grant of Dollars 5m and matched by a Phare grant, will help
to co-ordinate environmental issues throughout the region.
But when asked what the Bulgarian government is doing to address some of the
damage, Vodenicharov shrugs his shoulders.
The bitter in-fighting among the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), a loose
coalition of 19 political movements, to which Eco-Glasnost and the Green
Party belong, and between the UDF and the parliamentary majority held by the
Socialist (former communist) Party, means that every issue is politicised.
Vodenicharov says the government, wrestling to reduce the budget deficit
from 11 per cent of GDP in 1990 to 3.5 per cent of GDP in 1991, is in no
position to place the environment high on its economic agenda. 'Everybody is
in one way or other in favour of improving the environment, but my biggest
enemy is the empty pocket.'

<TEXT>
The Saimaa ringed seal is the most endangered animal in Finland. But a
campaign launched in 1979 - and relaunched last November - by the Worldwide
Fund for Nature (WWF) and the University of Joensuu in eastern Finland has
saved the Saimaa seal from extinction.
The Saimaa seal campaign generates funds in a variety of ways: through the
sale of its own products such as bird houses or clothes with the WWF panda
emblem, and by sponsoring schemes whereby companies pay for the right to use
the official WWF emblem in their advertisements.
'The campaign has been successful. In 1976 there were only 100 seals left
and we have been able to increase the number to 160,' said Mauri Rautkari,
secretary general of the Finnish branch of the WWF.
The new campaign takes the scheme further. For a sum of FM25,000 (Pounds
3,600 )a year a company can symbolically adopt a seal and for FM50,000 rent
a rock where the seal rests. A whole island where the seal breeds can also
be rented by a sponsor for FM200,000.
According to the WWF, 19 Finnish companies are taking part in the recent
campaign. Only one company - Tuko, a wholesale-retail chain - has so far
rented an island while the majority of companies prefer to adopt a seal.
As well as gaining publicity for being a sponsor, a company will receive a
serialised lithograph by a well-known Finnish painter for its contribution.
The size of the lithograph varies with respect to the size of the
contribution.
'There has not been much interest from the large forest companies which have
paper and pulp mills on the lake shores and the power companies which run
hydro-electric plants. They know that the damage they inflict on the Saimaa
seal is much greater than FM200,000,' said Rautkari.
Pollution, power companies and navigation authorities cause the water levels
of the lake to fluctuate. These variations can cause the collapse of the ice
and seal lairs.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Business and the Environment: Shell chairman to lead green
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a Shell refinery near Liverpool spilled 150 tonnes of oil into the
River Mersey two years ago, John Collins, then a director of the company,
took it personally. Shell was fined Pounds 1m - the highest pollution fine
ever levied in the UK.
Collins, now chairman of Shell UK, was chosen recently by Michael Heseltine,
secretary of state for the environment, to lead a committee of top
businessmen which will be advising the government on issues affecting
business and the environment. Heseltine said last night in a speech to the
Royal Society of Arts that he hoped the committee would be able to offer
clear advice on achieving international environmental goals.
As head of a group of business leaders who have been selected for their
interest and commitment to the environment, Collins is conscious that Shell
must improve its own record. 'Our risk as a polluter is high . . . Shell
cannot give any guarantees, but we are willing to meet certain standards. I
don't pretend that we're starting as a leader, we are all in a pioneering
role on this committee.'
When David Gee, director of Friends of the Earth, heard of Collins's
appointment, he said: 'Anyone from Shell certainly knows about pollution and
the government needs all the advice it can get.'
Collins is keen that the committee not be dismissed as yet another talking
shop. On his agenda are issues such as environmental management, recycling
and global warming. He wants to move quickly in setting goals to be achieved
in the committee's two-year life.
'There is no doubt that countries like Holland and Germany are a step ahead
of us, because of their determination to remain competitive in export
markets. But UK industry has woken up to the environment and is starting to
see it as a business opportunity.'
The learning curve is long, however. Industry typically takes an initial
look at environmental measures and is put off by the cost. Then it starts to
realise its competitors overseas are taking environmental initiatives and
begins to see that there would be a business opportunity in implementing
them. It is Collins's brief to try and turn some of this thinking into
concrete action.
Since the committee will advise and be consulted by Heseltine and Peter
Lilley, secretary of state for trade and industry, it can push for
government legislation as well as fiscal incentives. 'But I am hoping we can
get industry to deliver some of these things on its own. We will have to
move at a faster pace to be alongside the Netherlands and Germany in two
years, but if we don't do this we will be at a competitive disadvantage.'
Environmental management is one of his top priorities and he believes the
committee should draw up guidelines and help companies do an environmental
audit. In addition, he wants the body to look closely at recycling where one
company's waste product could be another firm's raw material.
The committee runs the gamut of UK industry including IBM, ICI, British Gas,
British Nuclear Fuels, Wessex Water, National Westminster Bank and
environmental consultants in a mix that is likely to provoke lively and
tough debate.
An important challenge for the group will be to restore the public's
confidence in industry's environmental record, particularly sectors that are
perceived as polluters such as the oil and nuclear industries. The US has
introduced comprehensive right-to-know laws which require companies to
publish regularly the levels of emissions they make, and environmental
groups have been pushing for the same standards in the UK.
Collins supports the public's right to this sort of information. 'The key to
succeeding in this is transparency and if we measure our emissions it can
make us more objective on what to do about them.'
He is optimistic that at the end of the committee's two-year life industry
will have met many of its environmental objectives and be clear about its
future aims. 'In the end, any body like this will be judged on what it does,
and we are looking for bold action, not rhetoric,' said Gee.

FT  08 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: SBC takes 10% Cragnotti stake

<TEXT>
SWISS Bank Corporation (SBC) has given its seal of approval to the new
merchant bank being set up by Mr Sergio Cragnotti, former managing director
of Italy's Enimont chemicals joint venture, by taking a 10 per cent stake,
worth around L45bn (Dollars 34.5m).
The new bank, called Cragnotti &amp; Partners Capital Investment, intends to
specialise in taking stakes in companies and cross-border deals. In March,
it made its debut with the CDollars 77m purchase of a controlling share in
Lawson Mardon, the international packaging group.
That deal, and the arrival of SBC, will go a some way to improve the
credibility of Mr Cragnotti's new venture, which is expected to have its
head office in London with a branch in Milan, and possibly other European
cities.
Some have dismissed the company as little more than an appendage for Italy's
Ferruzzi group, for which Mr Cragnotti worked prior to taking the post at
Enimont.
Milanese bankers suggested the new venture was little more than a
consolation prize from Ferruzzi to Mr Cragnotti for his efforts in having
run Enimont, the chemicals group formerly joint-owned by Montedison, the
chemicals concern which was controlled by Ferruzzi until last November.
However, reports that Mr Cragnotti had already gone some way to assemble
around L200m in capital - a figure confirmed by yesterday's announcement -
and evidence that Ferruzzi and its allies not means his only shareholders,
have helped scotch such talk.

FT  08 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Abbey National increases MTN
programme to Dollars 5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY National has increased the size of its global medium-term note (MTN)
programme from Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 5bn. The increase underlines the
bank's preference for this method of raising funds through the steady
issuance of privately-placed paper in place of big, public bond issues.
Mr Jonathan Nicholls, Abbey National deputy treasurer, said the increase
reflected the high legal expenses of changing the documentation. The new
upper limit should last Abbey National for two to three years, he added.
The MTN programme was set up last May and allows for the issuance of paper
in multiple currencies with maturities of more than a year. Dealers to the
programme are Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan.
More are to be added this week.
Abbey National aims to raise floating rate funding at below the London
interbank bid rate. This has proved impossible in the public bond markets.
The group has not made a public bond issue in the international market since
last July. In addition to MTN, it has concentrated on structured private
placements with institutional investors. In January, Abbey National placed
Dollars 250m of notes issued under the MTN programme with US institutions
under Securities and Exchange Commission rule 144a.
State Bank of New South Wales is arranging a Dollars 1bn multi-currency
global MTN programme to complement its ADollars 3bn domestic note programme.
The programme will allow the bank to issue notes in the Euromarket and place
paper in the US under rule 144a.

<TEXT>
PORTUGAL's first significant privatisation this year was completed
successfully on Monday with the sale of Sociedade Financeira
Portuguesa-Banco de Investimento (SFP), an investment bank, to a Portuguese
group headed by Mr Jose Manuel de Mello.
The sale raised just over Esc16bn (Dollars 107m), nearly 50 per cent more
than the bank's initial valuation, for the Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor, a
state-owned bank and SFP's only shareholder.
The de Mello group paid Esc14.5bn for about 89.5 per cent of the shares in a
joint bid with Mr Carlos Monjardino, head of the Fundacao do Oriente, a
diversified investment group, who paid Esc1bn for about 6 per cent of the
shares. The sale gives the two Portuguese entrepreneurs 95.5 per cent of the
bank's shareholding.
This was a higher proportion of shares than expected due to a low take-up of
shares by employees and other small investors.

MONTE dei Paschi di Siena, the big Italian bank, is gearing up its domestic
expansion strategy, despite rejecting plans to follow other public-sector
financial institutions and list its shares on the stock exchange, writes
Haig Simonian in Milan.
As part of the current reorganisation of the Italian banking sector, Monte
dei Paschi bank has formalised its bid for the Cassa di Risparmio di Prato,
a medium-sized regional bank, which will be considered by the Prato Cassa's
main shareholder later this month.
The bid, which may be made via Monte dei Paschi's Banca Toscana subsidiary,
is valued at around L200bn (Dollars 155m) for a stake of almost 73 per cent.
The deal would substantially deepen Monte dei Paschi's coverage of its
native Tuscany.
The bank may also be interested in bidding for Banca Popolare di Sassari,
the second biggest bank in Sardinia, with just under 40 branches and total
deposits of L1,600bn.
The bank, which last year raised group net profits by 11.3 per cent to
L419.9bn, reported that deposits at group level rose by 17.1 per cent to
L60,324bn last year, while loans increased by 23 per cent to L41,852bn. Net
earnings at parent bank level rose by 10 per cent to L251.5bn. The group's
three quoted banking subsidiaries, Credito Commerciale, Credito Lombardo and
Banca Toscana, will be paying dividends of L180, L160 and L220 respectively.

FT  08 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: High profile for Mexican
sell-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE high profile of newly-privatised Mexican companies in the international
capital market has been maintained with a Dollars 425m bond issue by Cemex,
the formerly state-owned cement company. The issue is the biggest bond
offering by a Latin American private sector company since the early 1980s.
The bond issue, lead managed by JP Morgan, was launched last week as Mr
Pedro Aspe, the Mexican finance minister, was in London to promote the final
stages of the privatisation of Telmex, the country's telephone operator.
The government is reducing its stake in Telmex from 26 per cent to 12 per
cent through an international offering of shares. The share sale, which is
expected to raise around Dollars 2bn, is among the largest international
equity offerings. It is also the first time a developing country has used an
international share sale to privatise a state-sector company.
In December, control of Telmex passed to a consortium led by Mexican
businessman Mr Carlos Slim Helu and backed by Southwestern Bell of the US
and France Telecom, the French state-owned operator.
The international share sale, co-ordinated by Goldman Sachs, involves the
offering of 25m American Depository Shares, each representing 20 non-voting
shares in Telmex. In addition, 40m ADS packages are being sold in the US and
5m in Japan. The shares will be priced later this month.
The stock comes on a strong recommendation from equity analysts at Salomon
Brothers. A research document published this week by Salomon analysts Ms
Stephanie Georges and Mr Richard Ryder said Telmex offered 'an attractive
investment opportunity because of the outlook for formidable expansion of
the local telephone network and its usage; the stock also represents a
reasonable proxy for growth prospects in Mexico'.
In London, Mr Aspe said that 138 companies had been privatised since
President Carlos Salinas came to power in 1988 and that a further 67
companies remained to be privatised. He added that seven of Mexico's 18
state-owned banks should be in private sector control by the end of this
year.
The government currently holds a 64 per cent stake in the banks, the rest
being held private sector stockholders.
After privatisation, foreign banks will be allowed to own up to 30 per cent
of a Mexican bank or financial services holding company. However, Mr Aspe
said it had not been decided whether the bank privatisations would include
an international offering of equity.
The 18 banks had total assets of 190,000bn pesos (Dollars 60.9bn) at the end
of June 1990, about 70 per cent of which are held by Banamex, Bancomer and
Banca Serfin - the three dominant players. Banamex is one of the seven banks
that will be privatised later this year.
Last week's bond issue by Cemex may have set a benchmark for other Latin
American companies looking to tap the international market. The paper
carries a coupon of 9.41 per cent and was launched at a discount to face
value to yield 15 per cent. This compares with a yield of around 10 per cent
on a recent Dollars 125m bond issue, also lead managed by JP Morgan, for
Nacional Financiera, the Mexican government development bank.
JP Morgan said that around Dollars 180bn of the Dollars 425m Cemex issue was
placed in the US under Securities and Exchange Commission rule 144a. Buyers
included institutions with no previous exposure to Mexican companies.

FT  08 MAY 91 / International Bonds: Borrowers tap high-yield sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPREAD of deals in high-yield currencies was launched in the international
bond market yesterday, as borrowers hurried to place paper before the US
Treasury bond auctions, which began yesterday, and this week's European
public holidays.
Credit Local, the French local authority funding vehicle, was the latest
borrower to tap the developing lira sector of the market, with a L150bn
deal, lead managed by Instituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino. It offered
five-year paper carrying a coupon of 12.2 per cent.
The fees structure caused several leading firms to decline to participate.
Full fees of 15 basis points were said to be inadequate return on capital.
Even so, demand from institutional investors proved strong and the deal
traded above its fixed re-offer price of 100.25.
Yorkshire Building Society became the third UK building society to tap the
sterling floating rate note sector since issuance was reopened in April.
Yorkshire added a fungible Pounds 100m to its outstanding Pounds 100m issue
maturing in 1994.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew handled the issue as a bought deal, charging full fees
of 10 basis points. The fee structure pleased firms which had argued for
higher underwriting fees in the fragile sector.
Several houses had declined to participate in the two earlier deals, for the
Woolwich and Cheltenham and Gloucester building societies because the
underwriting fees, at four basis points and eight basis points respectively,
were seen as not compensating the risk.
In the Australian dollar sector, the Western Australian Treasury Corporation
made a debut ADollars 100m seven-year issue lead-managed by Hambros. The
paper carries a coupon of 12 per cent and was priced at 101.80. It found
easy placement with investors attracted by the triple-A rated, sovereign
name. However, for other natural Australian dollar borrowers the Euromarket
looks increasingly expensive. Yesterday, for example, GECC placed ADollars
100m of bonds in the US market, with a coupon of 10 3/4 per cent and an
issue price of par.

FT  08 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Poland takes on Swarzedz debt
</HEADLINE>

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWARZEDZ Furniture Factory, whose shares are to go on sale on May 20 in
Poland's next privatisation, has had 66bn zlotys (Dollars 7.1m) worth of
bank debt and outstanding payments to the Treasury taken off its books by
the government.
Swarzedz has also been implementing management advice from the International
Finance Corporation, the World Bank affiliate, which has been responsible
for the sale since last summer.
This and the debt assumption are some of the novel features in the sale
which show that the government has learned from the experience of selling
the first five companies last autumn.
Then, a failure by private investors to take up the offer in three cases
forced the authorities to turn to state sector institutions at the last
minute to take up the slack. Now the state still directly or indirectly
holds a majority share in both the Tonsil electronics works and the Krosno
glass factory.
In the latest offer, four state-owned banks, including the new Polish
Development Bank, have agreed to underwrite the 1.9m Swarzedz shares
expected to go on sale at a price of 50,000 zlotys each.
In all, the privatisation sees the sale of 2.5m shares worth 125bn zlotys.
Some 100,000 shares have been set aside for former owners whose workshops
were nationalised after the Second World War to lay the foundation for the
present plant which employs 3,200.
Last year, the company exported three-quarters of its output. Export orders
were worth USDollars 23m.
Some 25bn zlotys of the proceeds from the sale will be ploughed back into
Swarzedz rather than being paid into the Treasury, as happened with the
entire proceeds of the first five privatisations. A large part of the sale
is to be conducted on a first-come, first-served basis which, according to
IFC, should cut delays at bank counters which plagued the initial
privatisation.

MOODY'S Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, has downgraded
CDollars 800m of Canadian Pacific's Ltd senior unsecured debt following last
Monday's announcement by the big conglomerate of a first-quarter loss of
CDollars 5.3m (USDollars 4.6m), or 2 cents a share, writes Robert Gibbens.
The unsecured debt is held mainly in subsidiaries. CP Ltd's consolidated
long-term debt was CDollars 4.4bn at the end of 1990. The downgrading is to
single A-2 from single A-1.
Moody's said that because of the long recession and the deep trough in the
forest products industry, CP Ltd's recovery would take longer than expected
and some interest coverage ratios would suffer. The recession has hit the
transportation units heavily besides forest products.

FT  08 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Quebec helps small business
with stock savings plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
QUEBEC is reviving its stock savings plan to help refinance small and
medium-sized businesses after the ravages of Canada's long recession.
The Quebec Stock Savings Plan was set up in 1979 but came into widespread
use only after the 1982-83 recession when banks' prime lending rates touched
20 per cent.
Quebec-resident investors could write off the cost of buying new stock
issues by Quebec-based companies within certain limits.
Between 1983 and 1987, underwriters arranged several hundred new equity
issues, bringing scores of smaller businesses public for the first time. The
underwriting boom coincided with fast economic recovery throughout North
America.
Altogether about CDollars 5bn was raised in new equity, and large companies
such as Bell Canada and Canadian Pacific could take advantage of the system.
Quebec investors went for the honeypot, and Nova Scotia and Alberta adopted
similar plans to stimulate their small business sectors.
The rules were tightened when the Quebec Liberals returned to power in late
1985. Then, after the October 1987 crash, the QSSP market dried up. The
public would not touch stocks again and underwriters could not sell any new
equity.
Quebec's finance minister, Mr Gerard Levesque, this January was faced with
new private sector demands for help in another deep recession. He has chosen
to revive the QSSP, put new equity into smaller businesses and also buttress
the Montreal Exchange with listings and trading activity. The exchange has
almost 20 per cent of Canada's equity trading volume by value.
His budget last week raises the 1991-92 deficit nearly 20 per cent to
CDollars 3.5bn, but interest rates have fallen and stocks are well up from
the 1990 lows and attracting new public interest.
This year, the small Quebec investor can deduct half the cost of new QSSP
shares issued by Quebec-based companies with total assets of CDollars 1bn to
CDollars 2.5bn, with a ceiling of CDollars 2,500 per investor, up from
CDollars 1,000. This means that shares of the largest companies are not now
eligible.
For shares of companies with assets of CDollars 250m to CDollars 1bn, the
deduction is 75 per cent of cost and for companies below CDollars 250m
assets it is 100 per cent, and in both cases without any dollar cap.

NORWAY'S Aker group yesterday announced it is to acquire Houston-based Omega
Marine engineering company in a move which forms a central plank in its
international expansion strategy.
Omega Marine had 150 employees and a revenue of Dollars 17m in 1990, while
last year Aker recorded profits of NKr632m (Dollars 93m) on turnover of
NKr13.41bn. The new company is to be called Aker Omega Marine.
Omega has been involved in several important engineering projects for the
Gulf of Mexico market and engineered the Joliett tension leg platform (tlp)
which has evolved into cost-efficient floating production technology for the
development of oil and gas fields.
Aker is best known for its giant gravity base offshore platforms, of which
it has built 13 for the North Sea and has three under construction.
Mr Gregers Kure, president of Aker Oil and Gas Technology, said the
acquisition gives his company a strong foothold in the Gulf of Mexico
market, where he estimates investment in tlps may reach Dollars 2bn annually
by 1994.
Aker and Omega have recently completed preliminary studies on tlps for
US-based Mobil Research and Development Company, Shell, Exxon and Amoco.
Omega Marine is currently owned by key employees and will continue to
operate under Mr Kenneth Caldwell, its president.

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CRA, the Australian resources group, will see earnings fall by between 20
and 25 per cent this year because of continued softness in commodity prices,
Mr Don Uhrig, chairman, told the annual meeting yesterday.
Mr Uhrig said profit before extraordinary items for the first three months
of the year was about 13 per cent lower than for the corresponding period in
1990. This follows a 27 per cent fall in net profit last year, from the
Dollars A648.4m in 1989 to Dollars A472.5m (USDollars 367.4m) in 1990.
'Until the US economy rebounds, it seems probable that commodity demand will
continue to soften and prices decline,' commented Mr Uhrig. But he added
that the exception was iron ore, mainly because of continued strong demand
by the Japanese steel mills.
CRA is one of Australia's top two producers of iron ore, coal and aluminium,
owns in a joint venture with North Broken Hill the large Pasminco base
metals group, and is the controlling shareholder in Australia's largest
diamond mine at Argyle, in Western Australia.
Mr Uhrig confirmed an earlier report that CRA wanted to re-open the copper
mine on the strife-torn island of Bougainville, which is occupied by
secessionist guerrillas. He hinted, however, that CRA would consider selling
its holding if this would help bring about a return to stability on the
island.
'Expectation is that CRA will retain its (53 per cent) shareholding in
Bougainville and re-start the mine in due course,' Mr Uhrig told
shareholders.
'However, we recognise that Bougainville Copper cannot resume operations
unless there is a political settlement. It does not appear such a settlement
is imminent, although some progress appears possible.
'Should it become obvious that CRA's continued participation in Bougainville
Copper prevents the attainment of such a political accommodation, then the
company would have to consider the disposal of its investment in the mine,'
he said.
CRA had withdrawn all its staff from the island in March, 1990, and,
therefore, it was not possible to assess accurately the condition of the
mine, one of the world's largest.

BELL Atlantic and Ameritech, the two US telecommunications companies which
last year bought New Zealand Telecom, have confirmed they were part of a
consortium buying control of Sky Entertainment, the New Zealand pay
television network.
The consortium, which includes Time Warner, the US media and entertainments
group, is paying more than NZDollars 100m (USDollars 59m) to buy 51 per cent
of Sky. This represents a handsome profit for the individuals and companies
which floated Sky last year.
The US companies are reported to be hoping to use New Zealand as a base for
a similar venture in Australia, which does not yet have Sky pay television.
The consortium is paying NZDollars 100m for control and injecting a further
NZDollars 25m in new capital. Last year, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech paid
NZDollars 4.25bn for NZ Telecom, and they are planning a share issue before
September to the New Zealand public and internationally.
The issue was required by agreements with the New Zealand government that
they reduce their stakes.
The agreement to buy Sky throws together a remarkable range of companies,
including the four American ones and New Zealand's Clear Communications,
which was set up to compete with Telecom, as well as Television New Zealand
which previously was a shareholder in Sky.
There have been reports that Ameritech and Bell Atlantic are also keen to
buy Australian Telecom and the Australian satellite system, Aussat, when
they are privatised.

PWA, parent company of Canadian Airlines International, has warned that it
does not expect to show a profit in 1991. It says the recession continues to
hold down recovery in air travel.
Canadian Airlines is the country's largest airline after Air Canada. Both
airlines have reduced their staffing by several thousand. Operations have
been cut severely, and March traffic results showed declines of around 20
per cent year-to-year in domestic and international travel.
The airlines are selling delivery positions for new fuel-efficient equipment
in their struggle to conserve cash resources into 1992.
PWA suffered an overall first-quarter loss of CDollars 63.8m (USDollars
55.5m), or CDollars 1.70 a common share, against a loss of CDollars 34.2m,
or CDollars 1.09, a year earlier.
Operating revenues were CDollars 661m against CDollars 662m and operating
expenses CDollars 742m against CDollars 704m. The operating loss was
CDollars 80.9m, against CDollars 41.7m.
Mr Rhys Eaton, PWA president, said the airline was ready to co-operate with
Air Canada on certain routes, with government approval. 'We could feed each
other traffic as Canadian carriers rather than turn traffic over to foreign
carriers,' he said.
Britain and the US are the only markets large enough to sustain two Canadian
carriers, he added, but a merger between the two airlines was unlikely.
Plans for an alliance between Canadian Airlines and a big US carrier are on
hold until 'open skies' talks to liberalise the Canada-US air treaty are
concluded.
DLT, the feeder subsidiary of Lufthansa, is prepared to back fully
Bombardier's plans to stretch its 50-passenger Regional Jet to 68-75
passengers.
'We could become lead customer for the bigger version as we did for the
50-passenger aircraft being test-flown this spring,' said Mr Gerhard Schmid,
DLT managing director.
Canadair, Bombardier's aerospace division, rolled out its 50-passenger
aircraft at the Montreal assembly plant this week.

FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Fiat and Ford clinch joint deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FIAT AND FORD, the Italian and US automotive groups, have completed an
agreement that combines their worldwide tractor, farm and earthmoving
equipment operations. The joint venture will be one of the world's top three
agricultural machinery suppliers.
Although signed in December, the agreement was announced last July. The
delay, Fiat said yesterday, was due mainly to two regulatory factors in the
US and Europe.
Last week, Fiat agreed to loosen its hold on tractor dealerships in Italy,
ending its exclusive supply arrangements with a national grouping of
farmers' co-operatives. That followed last month's sale of its Hesston
hay-making equipment division in the US to allay Federal anti-trust
concerns.
As a result of the Ford/Fiat agreement, the Italian company is forming a new
Netherlands-incorporated holding company, N. H. Geotech, into which Ford's
New Holland subsidiaries and Fiat's Geotech Group are being merged.
N. H. Geotech will be based in London, with Fiat owning 80 per cent of the
equity and Ford the remainder. The new company would have had sales of more
than Dollars 5bn last year.
N. H. Geotech's chairman and chief executive will be Mr Giorgio Garuzzo,
chief operating officer of Fiat SpA. Mr Giancarlo Vezzalini from Geotech
will be vice-chairman.
There will also be three executive vice-presidents: Mr Robert Gerrity, chief
executive of Ford New Holland; Mr Riccardo Ruggeri, chief executive of Fiat
Geotech; and Mr Vincenzo Morelli, formerly with General Electric of the US.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS BANK Corporation, Switzerland's second biggest bank, yesterday
effectively took direct control of Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), the
sixth biggest.
SBC took over the 36.5 per cent of the BSI capital, carrying 49.8 per cent
of the voting rights, which Unigestion, the Geneva-based finance company,
had acquired last year in a deal through which SBC ended up holding nearly
half the Unigestion stock and exercising indirect control over BSI.
Unigestion has ceded the BSI stock to SBC in return for 150,000 of its own
registered shares held by SBC. In addition, the Unigestion management
acquired 55,000 bearer shares in Unigestion from SBC, which retains a 14 per
cent stake in the finance company.
This exchange of shares in effect ends the adventure on which Unigestion
embarked in 1988 when, together with Mr George Klein, the New York real
estate developer, it bought a 49.9 per cent interest in BSI.
Last year, Unigestion bought out Mr Klein with the help of a loan from SBC
and a capital increase which more than doubled its equity and left SBC with
almost half its stock.
Unigestion said shareholders' equity had grown from SFr490 per share before
the BSI stock purchase in 1988 to SFr900 as a result of the latest
transaction.
The deal would allow it to repay the whole of its SFr378m (Dollars 270m)
debt, strengthen its treasury and concentrate on the financial services in
which it specialises. It planned to simplify its share structure over the
next few weeks.

<TEXT>
AEROSPATIALE, the French aerospace group, and MBB, the German aerospace
manufacturer, have created a joint venture - Eurocopter International - to
market jointly each others' helicopters.
This is a step towards the full merger of the helicopter businesses of
Aerospatiale and MBB, as agreed in outline last year and passed by the
European Commission competition authorities in February.
The pair have combined sales of FFr10bn (Dollars 1.6bn) - of which 70 per
cent comes from the French partner - making it the world's second largest
helicopter supplier after Sikorski of the US. Aerospatiale has 27 per cent
of world helicopter sales outside the US and the Soviet Union - considered
to be closed markets - while MBB has 4 per cent.
Eurocopter International is a marketing company equally owned by the pair,
and has already started talks on possible civil sales with two Soviet
helicopter design departments.
By the end of the year, Aerospatiale and MBB expect to complete negotiations
on the formation of a holding company, which would pool all their helicopter
activities and be roughly 60 per cent owned by Aerospatiale and 40 per cent
held by the German partner.
MBB, as the smaller partner, will have to make a cash payment to bring its
stake up to that level and may adjust its stake, said Eurocopter officials.
The pair are awaiting the results of independent company valuations before
completing the deal.

FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Improved sales in Europe lift VW
turnover 10%
</HEADLINE>

   WOLFSBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, the German car group which is investing heavily in east Germany
and Czechoslovakia, experienced a 10 per cent rise in turnover in the first
quarter of 1991, but net profits showed only a small increase.
The improved turnover of DM19bn (Dollars 11.1bn) reflected the continuing
sales improvement in Germany and the rest of western Europe, though some
markets such as the UK and Spain are proving difficult.
At DM195m, net profits were up by 2 per cent. The pre-tax figure was 16 per
cent lower at DM519m. However, Mr Dieter Ullsperger, the finance director,
said income was higher before VW made heavier transfers to reserves to cover
costs due later in the year. Such transfers carry tax advantages.
'The underlying business is better because of the shift in sales to the
domestic market', he added. Sales in the enlarged German market were 52 per
cent higher in the January-April period at 451,000 vehicles. In the whole of
western Europe, they were up by 10 per cent to 858,000. Worldwide sales were
also 10 per cent higher at 1.1m cars.
Mr Ullsperger declined to forecast the year's profit, noting the increased
strength of competition in Europe, uncertainty over currency trends - last
year's D-Mark strength chipped DM700m off group sales revenues - and the
fact that a new model was due later in the year.
VW will introduce the next generation of the Golf, its best-selling car,
this autumn, although Mr Carl Hahn, the chief executive, declined to confirm
this officially.
He expressed 'well-founded optimism' over the future, but said VW was
worried about the 7 per cent wage settlements negotiated in the engineering
industry, including cars. VW's next pay deal is due in November. Mr Hahn
said a settlement of this size would speed up the rise in costs and prices.
VW's overall profits in 1990 showed a 4.6 per cent rise after tax to
DM1.09bn, with turnover 4 per cent higher at DM68bn. Pre-tax profits were
down by 20 per cent to DM2.4bn. Unit sales passed the 3m mark, with a 3 per
cent increase to 3.03m.

<TEXT>
BAYER, the least recession-prone of the three German chemical giants,
yesterday reported a 5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to DM880m (Dollars
517.6m) for the first quarter of 1991.
Turnover fell by 2 per cent, although Polysar, the Canadian rubber company
which Bayer bought for Dollars 1bn last year, was included in the group
figures for the first time.
Bayer is partially protected from the recession by its large and highly
profitable pharmaceuticals business, which increased turnover by 8 per cent.
'Our performance was still hampered by the recession in the US and UK and by
the economic slowdown in Europe, which is gaining momentum,' said Mr Hermann
Strenger, Bayer chairman.
Apart from health care, all parts of Bayer suffered from the slow-down in
business. Industrial products were worst hit, with a 14 per cent fall in
sales (Bayer does not break down quarterly profits by sector).
Looking forward to the rest of the year, Mr Strenger said: 'There are some
positive factors that give us confidence and encouragement, even though the
economic climate has worsened.'
Bayer would benefit from the strengthening of the US dollar against the
D-Mark during April and from the low prices of petro-chemical raw materials,
he said. Profits for the whole year might be close to the 1990 level of
DM3.4bn, if the dollar did not weaken again.
Mr Strenger took the occasion of Bayer's financial press conference
yesterday to issue his strongest warning so far against 'the avalanche of
costs bearing down on us' as a result of recent and proposed environmental
legislation in Germany.

FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Government steps into VEV rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government is trying to prevent the country's biggest company
failure in a decade by stepping in to oversee rescue negotiations between
VEV, the struggling textiles group, and its bankers.
VEV, which employs some 11,000 people in its clothing and textile
businesses, has been placed under the supervision of the Interministerial
Committee for Industrial Reconstruction (CIRI), a unit of the Finance
Ministry.
Despite selling some of its most valuable assets, the group still has debts
estimated at nearly FFr2.5bn (Dollars 410m).
Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the two leading
state-owned banks, are understood to be the most heavily exposed lenders.
Credit Commercial de France (CCF) is involved mostly in VEV's capital, with
a smaller loan exposure.
VEV, whose shares were suspended on the stock exchange a week ago, said
yesterday that it was delaying publishing its 1990 results, which are
expected to show a sizeable loss, until next Monday.
In 1989, with its financial debt totalling FFr3.3bn, VEV reported net losses
of FFr188m. French press reports have suggested 1990's losses could exceed
FFr500m.
VEV's debt service is currently estimated to eat up 8 to 9 per cent of its
sales - FFr6.4bn in 1989 - and government officials believe it will need to
reduce this to 3 per cent in order to survive.
Since many of the most profitable assets have already been sold off, meeting
this target is expected to involve the write-off of a considerable portion
of VEV's outstanding bank debts.
Most French banks last year increased their provisions for bad debts
substantially to cover an increase in the number of corporate defaults, but
banking analysts believe most banks have not made provision for their VEV
debts.

THE takeover bid by Galeries Lafayette, the French department store group,
for its competitor, Nouvelles Galeries, will receive no opposition from
Nouvelles Galeries' main shareholder.
Devanlay, the family-controlled textiles group, which holds 47.5 per cent of
Nouvelles Galeries' voting rights, announced it will not contest Galeries
Lafayette's offer, valuing the group at FFr5.4bn (Dollars 9.15m).
Ironically, Galeries Lafayette did not at first intend to make a bid for
Nouvelles Galeries. But, it was forced to do so by the French stock exchange
council after it bought a block of Nouvelles Galeries shares from another
investor.
This lifted Galeries Lafayette's stake to 39 per cent, well above the 33 per
cent threshold at which French takeover law normally obliges a buyer to make
an offer for two-thirds of the company.

HOESCH, the diversified German steel and engineering group, yesterday
reported 1990 group operating profits down to DM440m (Dollars 258.8m) from
DM517m in 1989, reflecting a DM100m drop in steel profits.
The company, which has been the focus of uncertainty about its future
leadership, is maintaining a dividend of DM10 for last year.
Total consolidated turnover rose to DM16.1bn from DM15.8bn in 1989. Group
net profits were given as DM103m; comparisons with 1989 were hindered by
changes in accounting procedures bringing accounts on to a consolidated
basis.
Whereas steel profits in 1989 accounted for half the operating profit, last
year's steel ratio fell to only 35 per cent. Mr Gunter Flohr, board member
in charge of sales, said he believed the slide in steel prices would come to
an end in the second quarter, leading to a price increase of DM20 to DM35
per tonne.
Hoesch's supervisory board last month ended speculation by announcing that
Mr Kajo Neukirchen, head of investment goods group Klockner Humboldt Deutz,
would take over as chief executive.

FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Accounting proposals under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW accounting proposals issued last month by the Accounting Standards Board
could discourage productivity growth in the UK company sector, according to
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank.
The ASB's proposals envisage a radical overhaul of UK company profit and
loss accounts, including the virtual abolition of the distinction between
extraordinary and exceptional items.
Goldman argues that companies will be discouraged from undertaking necessary
restructuring of their businesses. Under the ASB's proposals, all costs will
have to be taken 'above the line' and earnings per share, and share prices,
will suffer as a result.
According to Dr Sushil Wadwhani, an analyst at Goldman, the companies most
likely to be affected are those that regularly report extraordinary charges
 -costs taken below the line.
In this category are: Lucas Industries, Trafalgar House, Simon Engineering,
Fenner, Portals Holdings, GKN, Macarthy, Molins, Grampian Holdings, Howden
Group, Bunzl, Costain, Fisons and Pilkington, all of which have reported net
extraordinary items in at least four of the last five years.
Dr Wadwhani says that the stock market is fixated on reported earnings per
share. Although the economic reality is the same however the restructuring
is accounted for, Dr Wadwhani argues that the cosmetic change will affect
investors' attitudes to companies.

Retailing was profitable overall and the department stores continued to show

The auditors again qualified the accounts as to the provisions and work in

FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: No change of control for Mt Charlotte
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIERLEY Investments, the New Zealand investment group, confirmed yesterday
that it had no plans to sell its majority stake in Mount Charlotte
Investments, the UK's second largest hotel group with properties ranging
from the Royal Horseguards hotel to the Selfridge hotel, writes David
Churchill.
Mr Jeremy Kemsley-Pein, a director of BIL in London, said yesterday that BIL
was 'absolutely committed' to ownership of Mount Charlotte.
He acknowledged, however, that BIL might sell further shares in the hotel
chain while retaining a 51 per cent majority stake.
'We have had a number of approaches from investors in Mount Charlotte and it
is something we are looking at,' he said.
Mr Kemsley-Pein's confirmation of BIL's continuing control of Mount
Charlotte follows Monday's sale of 30 per cent of its stake in the hotel
group to the overseas investment arm of the Singapore government for Pounds
227.5m.
The deal had been on the cards for some time, partly to reduce BIL's debt
levels, but also because BIL did not want to retain 100 per cent control of
the hotel group.
After holding a stake of just under 30 per cent in Mount Charlotte for some
years, it was forced to launch a full-scale bid last September when it
acquired a 10 per cent block of Mount Charlotte shares for 73p per share
from the Kuwaiti Investment Office.
The success of BIL's opportunistic bid surprised the City, but some
institutional investors evidently had decided that the recession and
worsening Gulf Crisis meant they should pull out of hotel stocks.
The acquisition price of 73p a share was considerably less than the 85p a
share deal struck with the Singapore government.
City analysts last night suggested that the share price premium reflected a
major coup for BIL as it came after the worst trading period for hotels.
Speculation now centred on what deal BIL might do next.
'There is nothing in the pipeline at the moment,' said Mr Kemsley-Pein. 'But
we are constantly looking for opportunities.' He confirmed that these
opportunities might come from Australia.
Mr Robert Peel, chief executive of Mount Charlotte, said yesterday that the
share sale had been anticipated and was a welcome move. 'It means that there
will be a secure base for our further development over the next few years,'
he said.
But Mr Peel acknowledged that the sale had come after 'some very tough
trading in the past few months' and a slow recovery in tourists and business
travellers.
Mount Charlotte has been particularly hit by the downturn in travel to
London, since it is the largest hotel chain in the capital.
In Singapore yesterday the deal was seen as a long-term strategic move. Mr
Ng Kok-Song, deputy managing director of the Singapore Government Investment
Corporation (GIC), described Mount Charlotte as a well-managed company with
a portfolio of well-located hotels in London. This was seen as a growth
tourist and commercial destination, he added.

SAATCHI &amp; SAATCHI, the advertising group, yesterday saw its shares slip by
just  1/2 p to 19 3/4 p when St James Place Capital, one of Lord
Rothschild's funds, sold 75m shares to UBS Philips &amp; Drew, the securities
house.
P&amp;D then placed almost all the shares at 19 1/4 p. The placing is said to
have been over-subscribed.
After the disposal St James now holds 61m Saatchi shares, or 4 per cent of
the overall equity, worth Pounds 12m on Saatchi's current market
capitalisation of Pounds 304m. Other funds linked to Lord (Jacob) Rothschild
are believed to hold additional stock.
St James was involved last month in underwriting a Pounds 55m rights issue
for 10p a share as part of Saatchi's recently completed emergency
recapitalisation.
Before the recapitalisation St James Place was the largest holder of
Saatchi's Europreference shares. Under the terms of the recapitalisation
those shares were exchanged for 86m ordinary shares. It then acquired an
additional 50m shares as a result of the rights issue.
Although St James made a profit from yesterday's transaction on its rights
issue investment, it is believed to be still showing a loss on its original
investment, estimated at about Pounds 35m, in the Europreference issue.
St James said that it had sold the shares to ensure that Saatchi, which is
its biggest single investment, accounted for no more than 5 per cent of its
assets. This was the proportion of assets Saatchi represented after the
original purchase of Europreference shares.
Yesterday's placing came only two weeks after a group of its US investors
sold 53m shares. These investors, which included ESL Partners, a
Dallas-based finance house, and Mr Lawrence Tisch, the New York businessman,
were also involved in underwriting the rights issue.
St James and ESL Partners, which is also still a substantial Saatchi
shareholder with 53m shares, have both been invited to appoint non-executive
directors to the Saatchi board.

FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Gloomy Jarvis halved to Pounds 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JARVIS, the construction and property group which has taken advantage of the
recession to buy failed building companies from the receivers, yesterday
announced a sharp fall in profits for 1990.
The taxable outcome fell to Pounds 1.01m compared with Pounds 2.01m for the
nine months to end-1989. Turnover rose to Pounds 64.03m (Pounds 55.34m).
Mr Harvey Bard, chairman, warned: 'The UK construction industry remains deep
in recession and we anticipate that 1991 will be a very difficult year for
all involved in the industry.'
The group's balance sheet, however, remains strong with net borrowings
equivalent to 34 per cent of shareholders funds. The company had no
off-balance sheet financing.
During the last 12 months Jarvis has acquired from receivers the Shephard
Hill civil engineering and Newman Shopfitter businesses.
Mr Bard said: 'The severe recession in the construction industry led to a
number of basically sound subsidiary businesses being forced onto the market
by problems within their parent companies. Using our financial strength we
were able to take advantage of this.'
Falling commercial property prices prompted Jarvis to write down the value
of its property investment portfolio by Pounds 3.6m. It also wrote off
Pounds 700,000 against goodwill on acquisitions reducing shareholders funds
to Pounds 17.6m.
A proposed final dividend of 1.175p makes a total of 2p (1.875p) for the
year.
Earnings per share fell from an annualised 9.9p to 4.2p.

FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Auditors forced to resign over TGI row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TGI, the audio and electronic products group, has appointed KPMG Peat
Marwick McLintock as auditors following the resignation last month of
Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte.
The dispute which led to the resignation centres on profit figures reported
by Tannoy Audix, a company bought by TGI on earnout terms in February 1989.
Reported 1990 pre-tax profits for Audix were Pounds 1.1m but TGI said in a
statement yesterday said that the board was now of the opinion that Audix
did not make a profit at all in 1990, following an investigation into the
company by Peat Marwick.
TGI said it stood to suffer a potential loss because these accounts, audited
by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, formed the basis of payments due to the vendors of
Audix under the earnout agreement.
TGI issued loan notes to the vendors amounting to Pounds 1m before it
investigated the Audix accounts, but it has yet to pay any cash to vendors.
Mr Norman Crocker, TGI chairman, said yesterday that a precise
quantification of the potential loss would become clear as the 1991 audit
got under way.
In the meantime, he said the company had taken the following action:
sought, and obtained the resignation of Coopers as auditors, following legal
advice to the TGI board to the effect that Coopers are likely to have been
in breach of contract and/or to have been negligent. Coopers denied these
allegations;
dismissed Mr John Billett, one of the vendors, as executive chairman of
Audix. 'The board considers that (Mr Billett) may bear some responsibility
as to certain matters at Audix', yesterday's statement said. Mr Crocker
refused to elaborate on this;
TGI proposes to resist making any payment of the contingent consideration
under the loan notes.
Coopers has written a letter denying the allegation of negligence which is
to be circulated to TGI shareholders.

Increased exports helped boost pre-tax profits at Toye, the civil and
military regalia manufacturer, from Pounds 690,493 to Pounds 720,915 for the
year to end-December.
Turnover was ahead 12 per cent from Pounds 11.03m to Pounds 12.39m. The
increase included a rise of 37 per cent in direct exports, valued at Pounds
1.73m.
Mr Michael Prokopiw, company secretary, said: 'With a downturn in certain UK
markets the group is seeking alternatives to support manufacturing areas
affected, whilst at the same time continuing to undertake a thorough review
of overheads.'
Export inquiries and orders booked remained at an all time high, he added.
Earnings per share stood at 22.02p, up from 20.19p. The single dividend for
the year is maintained at 8p.

FUELLED BY acquisitions pre-tax profits at Ambassador Security Group
improved 64 per cent, from Pounds 625,000 to Pounds 1.02m, in 1990.
Fully diluted earnings per share showed a more modest increase, from 4.08p
to 4.26p. The basic figure declined to 4.33p (4.48p).
During the year the Kent-based company made a number of purchases including
Alarm Manufacturing and Electronic Holdings for Pounds 2.5m when it raised
about Pounds 4m from a placing and open offer. At the same time it moved up
from the USM to the main market.
For the future Mr Paul Skuse, chairman, said in the recession the company
was striving for greater efficiency and productivity. The first three months
of 1991 were up to expectations.
Turnover was more than doubled at Pounds 4.69m (Pounds 2.1m). A final
dividend of 0.25p is proposed for a total of 0.6p (0.5p).

FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Slimmed-down Ropner shows sharp decline to
Pounds 5.53m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROPNER, the Darlington based mini-conglomerate, reported pre-tax profits
down from Pounds 7.51m to Pounds 5.53m last year as it continued pruning its
peripheral businesses.
Property profits for 1990 were slashed to Pounds 394,000 (Pounds 5.02m).
Engineering profits fell to Pounds 537,000 (Pounds 727,000) and
contributions from shipping to Pounds 1.41m (Pounds 2.91m).
The insurance brokerage side, since sold, suffered a loss of Pounds 979,000
following a loss of Pounds 954,000 the previous year.
The lower profits were, however, in line with forecasts as the outcome for
1989 was boosted by an exceptional contribution of Pounds 3.6m arising from
the disposal of investment property.
The setbacks were partially offset by a surge in investment income to Pounds
2.11m (Pounds 105,000) and by a fall in interest payable to Pounds 815,000
(Pounds 2.09m).
Turnover was down 44 per cent to Pounds 35.39m (Pounds 63.52m).
The figures reflected both a slowdown in activity and the effects of
withdrawal from several businesses.
Following the disposal of its property development activities, the group
sold Hozelock, its garden products division, in June.
Ropner Insurance Holdings, its insurance broking business, was sold in
April.
The disposals leave the group with shipping, engineering and property
investment as core businesses.
'We feel that we have now achieved the optimum profile of the group,' said
Mr Roger Winter, finance director. The disposals - together with the sale of
two ships - brought an extraordinary gain of Pounds 8.31m, and increased the
consolidated net asset value of the group to Pounds 39.11m from Pounds
26.14m in 1989.
Due to the restructuring, the group has about Pounds 17m in cash. This
should further increase its investment income this year while the trading
climate for engineering remains grim and no significant rises are expected
in investment property or shipping, Mr Winter said.
Earnings per share fell to 15.8p (16.8p) and a final dividend of 4.75p is
recommended for a total of 8.25p (7.5p).

FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Bank of Ireland First Holdings shows loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Ireland First Holdings, the holding company for the Bank of
Ireland's US subsidiary First NH Banks, reported a loss before tax for the
quarter to March 31 1991 of IRPounds 12.1m (Pounds 10.93m).
This follows a loss of IRPounds 19m in the preceding quarter, and of
IRPounds 3.3m in the first quarter of 1990, a record which prompted the
resignation of Mr Mark Hely-Hutchinson, the Bank of Ireland's chief
executive, last year.
However, progress has been made in reducing operating costs, which, at
Pounds 15.9m against Pounds 16.6m, were 4 per cent down on the same period
last year.
But loan loss provisions remain 'unacceptably high', and income continues to
be adversely affected by a high level of non-performing assets. The capital
position of First NH Banks was strengthened during the quarter by an
investment of Dollars 25m (Pounds 14.57m) in equity from the group.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Capital Ventures, a subsidiary of Rutland Trust, the financial services
group, yesterday launched a hostile bid for Harcourt Group valuing the
heavily borrowed plastic and catering company at Pounds 2.54m.
Harcourt shareholders are being offered two CV shares or 200p in cash for
every 25 held, valuing their shares at 8p. The shares rose 2p to 8p
yesterday.
Mr Peter Underhill, CV managing director, who owns 25 per cent of the
subsidiary, wants to merge the two companies before seeking a listing on the
Stock Exchange. Harcourt is currently quoted on the USM.
Harcourt is opposed to the offer, but Mr Underhill claims to have the
support of 40 per cent of its shareholders.
The group has borrowings of some Pounds 5m against net assets of less than
Pounds 5m. Last year it reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 193,000 for the
six months to end-September, which it blamed on the economy.

FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Tootal attacks Coats over its 'failed
acquisition' strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOOTAL, the textile group battling against a Pounds 252m takeover bid from
Coats Viyella, yesterday attacked its suitor for its 'failed acquisition
strategy' and 'record of commercial failure'.
Coats, which last week announced its second and final offer of 83.3p per
share, dismissed Tootal's claims as a 'misrepresentation' of its strategy
and 'deliberate use of incomplete information'.
The battle between Coats and Tootal, which two years ago agreed terms for a
Pounds 395m friendly merger, has become increasingly bitter in the two
months since Coats unveiled its first offer.
In a document posted to shareholders yesterday Tootal attacked Coats'
commercial record. It claimed that reported profits from each of Coats'
textile divisions have 'fallen sharply' since 1987 and that a number of its
businesses have 'serious commercial problems'.
Tootal also criticised Coats for providing 'inadequate information' on the
profitability of its South American operations and questioned its method of
accounting for its interests in the region.
Similarly it attacked Coats' acquisition record saying it had spent more
than Pounds 1bn on acquisitions between 1982 and 1986, but that its market
capitalisation was just Pounds 644m before the Tootal bid.
Coats, which has already attacked Tootal's record and accountancy practises,
is reorganising its European interests by transfering thread production from
Austria to Italy and Portugal. This should save Pounds 2m in a full
financial year and produce Pounds 2.5m in surplus asset realisations this
year. Coats is also investing Pounds 1.5m in a new zip plant in Portugal.

FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Beattie warns on current half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES BEATTIE, the Wolverhampton-based department store group, derived a
third of its Pounds 9m pre-tax profit from interest income in the year to
January 31.
It was the ninth year of growth in taxable profits. However, the company
warned that the first half of this year would not match the Pounds 3m
achieved in the six months to July 1990.
Sir Eric Pountain, the non-executive chairman, said that the decline in
interest rates would reduce this source of income ahead of a restoration of
consumer confidence.
Trading profit last year fell to Pounds 6.02m (Pounds 6.28m). Mr Malcolm
Smart, a director and company secretary, said margins had been squeezed
because of lower prices.
Interest and investment income rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 3.01m (Pounds
2.5m). The amount of cash held expanded by Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 23.9m.
The pre-tax figure advanced from Pounds 8.77m to Pounds 9.02m on turnover of
Pounds 67.12m (Pounds 64.18m). Heavy snow in December reduced sales by
nearly Pounds 1m.
The group opened a new store in Burton-upon-Trent in the autumn, bringing
its total to seven. Capital spending fell to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 3.6m), but
is likely to rise substantially this year as most of the Pounds 7m earmarked
to build a new store in Worcester goes out.
A plan for a new store in Macclesfield has been abandoned because the
developer failed to find sufficient finance.
Earnings per share rose to 13.03p (12.51p). The proposed final dividend is
increased to 4.1p, making a total of 5.5p (5p).

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST PACIFIC, the Hong Kong investment group, has built up a 43.2 per cent
stake in Internatio-Muller, the Rotterdam-based trading and technical group,
prompting the Dutch company to erect anti-takeover defences.
The Hong Kong group yesterday proposed that Internatio merge with Hagemeyer,
First Pacific's 69 per cent owned Dutch-based trading house. The deal would
create an international group with annual sales of more than Fl 5.5bn
(Pounds 2.8bn).
Trading in all three companies' shares was suspended yesterday in Amsterdam
and is due to resume today.
First Pacific said it would pursue the merger only if the proposal won the
full support of Internatio's board.
Internatio rejected a merger but agreed to investigate the proposal.
However, it also made an immediate issue of 5.59m preference shares to a
friendly company foundation, a common takeover defence in the Netherlands.
The move doubles its total share capital and halves the voting strength of
First Pacific's stake to just 21.6 per cent.
'Internatio-Muller is of the opinion that a merger with Hagemeyer would
result in no or hardly any benefits of synergy and that a merger with
Hagemeyer is in direct conflict with (our) new strategy,' the Rotterdam
company said.
Hagemeyer and First Pacific insisted their intentions were friendly,
although Internatio's response suggests that a battle may be brewing.
Mr Derek Murphy, First Pacific's corporate communications director, said
Internatio's issue of new preference shares was 'not surprising' and the
company was 'not terribly put out'. Some attempt to maintain the status quo
had been expected, he said.
Mr Manuel Pangilinan, managing director, has said he regards Hagemeyer as a
'springboard for expansion' in Europe and the US, although the group's 'main
focus' would remain in Asia, source of most of the company's capital,
management and profits.
With sales of Fl 2.5bn, Hagemeyer, has grown rapidly in recent years. Since
First Pacific acquired a stake in 1983, the company has halted its
manufacturing operations, pulled out of commodities and ended its presence
in Africa.
The company is now mainly a trader of consumer and professional brand name
products, including those of Panasonic, JVC, Moulinex and Christian Dior.
First Pacific recently reported a 28.4 per cent increase in after-tax
profits for 1990 to HKDollars 366m (Pounds 27.1m), before extraordinary
items.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Aegis unveils refinancing details
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AEGIS, Europe's biggest media buying group, yesterday announced a
refinancing package including a Pounds 30m placing and the Pounds 23.4m
acquisition of the remaining shares in TMD, a leading UK media-buying
business.
Mr Peter Scott, chairman, said yesterday's deals 'strengthened' Aegis'
financial position and were an 'important step' in consolidating its
media-buying interests.
Aegis' shares rose 20p to 213p on the announcement. TMD, which is quoted on
the USM, saw its shares soar by 93p to 340p.
Aegis, which last year changed its name from the WCRS Group after
diversifying from its original advertising interests, has been expanding its
European media-buying interests through Carat, its Paris-based subsidiary.
It emerged as a minority investor in TMD two years ago and now owns 29.9 per
cent.
Aegis, advised by Salomon Brothers, is offering 330p cash for the remaining
TMD shares, or shares on a 33-for-19 basis. This values TMD, which made
pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m on turnover of Pounds 170m in the year to
August 31, at Pounds 33.4m.
Because TMD already operates as part of the Carat network, the deal should
make little difference in operational terms. However, it should be
financially beneficial by allowing Aegis to realise its UK tax losses.
The Pounds 30m placing of shares with Warburg Pincus, the US fund management
group, will be used to finance the TMD deal and reduce debt. Warburg Pincus
will increase its existing 7 per cent stake to up to 15 per cent.
Samuel Montagu, the London merchant bank, has underwritten a new FFr150m
(Pounds 14.84m) five-year term loan and FFr500m revolving credit facility
for Aegis.
As part of the refinancing Aegis has renegotiated the terms of its defered
payments for the purchase of Carat. Originally it was due to make two
payments of FFr125m in cash or shares in December 1991 and 1992. These
payments will now be met by the issue of 12.5m Aegis shares.
Aegis, which is fighting a Dollars 308m (Pounds 173m) law suit in the US,
still has to make a FFr125m payment in cash or shares in December 1993 and
to make future cash payments of up to Pounds 49m by 1995.

FT  08 MAY 91 / One-day Tube strike called off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAIL UNIONS yesterday called off a one-day strike on the London Underground
planned for tomorrow after agreeing a compromise with management over job
losses.
The agreement lifts the threat of a series of 24-hour stoppages similar to
those which disrupted the Tube network two years ago.
However, a threat to British Rail services during the summer remains because
of a separate dispute over a 7 per cent pay offer.
RMT, the largest rail union, is seeking members' support for industrial
action, although BR said yesterday that arbitration over a similar offer to
the TSSA and Aslef unions will start on Thursday.
Settlement of the Underground dispute follows two days of talks last week at
Acas, the conciliation service.
London Underground yesterday denied RMT claims that it had agreed to save
200 of 1,005 jobs it planned to cut from its 22,500 total. There would still
be 800 job losses among members of RMT and TSSA, the other union which had
threatened a strike tomorrow. The other 200 or so jobs to go would be among
Aslef members or employees who do not belong to a union.
In the Acas talks, however, London Underground said there were no plans for
further job losses at present, thus allaying union fears of a 'hidden
agenda' on staff numbers.

FT  08 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Volkswagen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Seen from Wolfsburg, Volkswagen is taking advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to grab European market share; shifting a big chunk of its cost
base out of the D-Mark; and building a set of neatly segmented brands to end
forever the slur that it is a single marque/single platform company.
But by moving into east Germany and Czechoslovakia, boosting its presence in
Spain and investing in China and Mexico, VW is doing shareholders no
short-term favours. It is lavishing money - DM42bn over the next five years
 -on plants around the world; it is making only small inroads into its
German cost problem; and, to start with at least, its brand portfolio will
prove costly and confusing to customers. At a time when the German car
market is booming as rarely before, the benefits are not coming through to
the bottom line. Yesterday, VW reported that first quarter German sales -
probably the most profitable part of the group's output - were 52 per cent
higher than a year before. Yet pre-tax profits actually fell, admittedly
after hefty transfers to reserves.
Whether its gamble eventually pays off for shareholders depends on how much
of that DM42bn capital spending is met out of the cash flow of the operating
businesses. But for at least three of those subsidiaries, in Czechoslovakia,
Argentina and China, tossing a coin is probably as good a guide to the
outcome as any number of scrupulous cash-flow projections. With the share
price down 41 per cent since German economic union, the next money to be
made in VW shares will go to those who guess which way the coin is coming
down.

FT  08 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Jefferson Smurfit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is obviously more to packaging than cardboard boxes. Ireland's biggest
industrial company outperformed the bulk of its worldwide rivals on the
trading front last year. But what stands out from yesterday's results is the
impact of the previous year's complex financial restructuring in the US. The
profit and loss account gains from a much reduced tax charge - 24 per cent
instead of 41 per cent - and a small but creditable advance in earnings per
share; the balance sheet remains awash with net cash and, due to
deconsolidation, is unaffected by the Dollars 2.6bn of non recourse debt
being supported by JSC.
Smurfit's decision to lower its stake in North America was inspired mainly
by fiscal and strategic considerations. The timing now looks pretty clever
too, with IPounds 800m of cash extracted at the top of the cycle. The group
is better balanced geographically as a consequence and is well placed to
pick up new acquisitions while the paper industry is in the doldrums. This
year will again be difficult and pre-tax profits and earnings -
notwithstanding another relatively light tax charge - could be off by as
much as 10 per cent.
Smurfit's prospective multiple of just below 13 might seem a touch grudging.
The company's financial wizardry, however, leaves just a lingering suspicion
over the quality of earnings and the increase in shareholders' funds.

FT  08 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: US refunding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Treasury market has not Quayled in front of the Dollars 37bn
refunding due this week, despite a falling dollar and growing support for
the recovery-this-year scenario - the latest from the influential Purchasing
Managers' Association. Its semi-annual forecast calls for rising output in
the second half, though not enough to prevent a drop in manufacturing for
1991 as a whole. But the Senate Budget Committee voted unanimously yesterday
to ignore the anti-recession clause in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, and
keep existing spending limits in place, so the public sector remains under
some sort of restraint.
Meanwhile, industrial investment is seen by the purchasing managers as
weaker than in earlier forecasts; and likely to remain so. This suggests
weak credit demand from the most credit-worthy private borrowers. Treasury
bonds, especially the Dollars 13.5bn of three-year paper on offer yesterday,
look like an attractive investment for banks: where else can you find a
riskless 134-basis-point spread over Federal Funds?
Is this just a temporary flight to quality, or something more significant?
It is not so many years since banks routinely held half their assets or more
in government paper; and they may now be risk-averse enough to regress to
those days. Treasury Secretary James Brady was yesterday begging Congress to
go easy on demands for higher capital, for fear of squeezing the banks still
further. But if they want to hold Treasury paper anyway, enforced prudence
will make little difference.

FT  08 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Putting a floor under the North Sea
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,540.5 (+17.8)
Oil exploration companies have been singularly out of favour since October
last year. Sentiment will doubtless improve if Enterprise confirms a joint
venture with Elf of France to buy the North Sea assets of Occidental.
Whether this will signal a fundamental change for the sector is unclear.
The least that can be said for any Enterprise/Elf deal is that at around
Dollars 1.4bn it would work out roughly 40 per cent more per barrel than
Lasmo paid for Thomson North Sea two years ago, which should put a floor
under the price of similar assets. Given that stocks which normally trade at
a premium are languishing at discounts to asset value - shares in Lasmo and
Enterprise are at discounts of 13 and 35 per cent respectively - this would
be a boost of sorts, but scarcely constitutes grounds for a re-rating. If
the sector was clearly expensive last year, it is not self-evidently cheap
at today's low relative level.
Any deal with Elf over Occidental will probably include a resolution of the
French company's 25 per cent stake in Enterprise, perhaps by a swap for a
share in the Nelson field. This would certainly satisfy the politicians. The
removal of that overhang, plus the cash flow benefits of the asset swap,
would only be a significant fillip for Enterprise if it can avoid tax
complications on the Elf stake.
Investors who believe in the continuing fecundity of the North Sea will
doubtless stick with Enterprise until it diversifies. Judging by BP and
Shell's recent international finds, prospects might be better further
afield, in which case Lasmo and Ultramar probably have the edge.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Letter: Glimmer of hope in trade talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof D GREENAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Several of the features which you ran in the issues of April 26 and the
weekend of April 27/28 illustrate admirably some of the risks associated
with a failure of the Uruguay Round. In particular were the reports that
Japan faces trade sanctions by the US; the Korean declaration that it would
maintain an import ban on rice; and the continued discussions surrounding a
North American free trade area. The first of these takes forward Super 301
action to new territory; the second is no doubt action which has been
promoted by the Japanese rice ban, and the third - as some commentators have
noted - raises the prospect of the US becoming even more concerned with
regional trade liberalisation than global trade liberalisation.
These developments really do highlight the need for a resumption of serious
negotiations in Geneva. One glimmer of hope came through another of your
features on April 26, which indicated that the 15 negotiating groups are
being slimmed down to eight negotiating areas.
This actually gives some cause for optimism given the difficulties which
were associated with linkage across negotiating groups and the stimulus that
this gave to what Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, referred to as
'hide and seek tactics'. The fact that the new negotiating areas actually
embrace cognate issues ought to make the cutting of deals easier.
We must hope now that the major protagonists actually take advantage of the
opportunities provided by this slimmed-down framework. Strong gestures from
the US in the form of fast-track approval; from the EC on agriculture; and
from Japan on rice could clear the way for a serious resumption of
negotiations. The new framework raises a little the probability that these
negotiations could yet reach a satisfactory conclusion.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DOUGLAS DALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I agree entirely with Mr Allen Sykes' analysis (Letters, May 3) of the
role of institutional shareholders in corporate governance. However, he
makes no recommendations, other than more discussions.
By their very nature, such shareholders will never willingly give up their
present freedom to make quick profits. There is only one solution to put new
life into British industry. Capital gains should be subject to penal rates
of tax if they arise from shares held for a short time, and to very low
rates if held for a long time. There is no other way of making institutions
support companies planning for long-term rather than short-term profits.
The City will not like it, but the health of our industry is more important
by far than merchant bankers', unit trust holders' or even life policy
holders' short-term profits.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Foreign Affairs: Problem awaiting a solution - After the
Gulf war, the west can no longer afford to regard Turkey as an insoluble
difficulty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Turgut Ozal must be furious. Since Iraq invaded Kuwait last
August, he has acted with bold and imaginative statesmanship, going against
the tide of Turkish public opinion to secure long-term strategic advantages
for his country. He used the crisis to reassert not only Turkey's strategic
importance to the west, but also its credentials as a European state.
He called for democracy in Iraq, and took steps to remove some
anti-democratic clauses in the Turkish constitution - notably those banning
parties based on group interests and banning press publications in languages
(such as Kurdish) that are forbidden by law.
Even more remarkably, Mr Ozal invited Iraqi Kurdish leaders to Ankara, where
they were told by senior foreign ministry officials that the president would
support a federal solution for Iraq, giving autonomy to the Kurdish and
Turkmen minorities. There were even hints that he was contemplating
something similar in Turkey itself, as a way to isolate and defeat the
violent separatism of the Workers' Party of Kurdistan.
Perhaps most remarkably of all, Mr Ozal has established direct and friendly
ties with Soviet Armenia.
This week, as if to cap all these efforts, Mr Ozal publishes the English
edition of his book, Turkey in Europe and Europe in Turkey. Alas, the
actions of his local subordinates on the Iraqi frontier have ruined the
effect.
The dominant images of the past few weeks, as far as western public opinion
is concerned, have been those of Turkish soldiers barring the road to
Kurdish refugees, beating and even shooting them. Finally, in a spectacular
public relations own goal typical of Middle Eastern rather than modern
European governments, the authorities in south-east Turkey arrested and
expelled a leading British journalist who had reported, on the evidence of
British and American servicemen, that Turkish soldiers were looting refugee
supplies.
Clearly Turkey has a long way to go before public opinion in western Europe
will be persuaded that it is a country eligible for EC membership. Many
Turks recognise this, including (privately at least) some of those whose
difficult task it is to represent the Turkish government in other European
capitals. 'We have to solve our own problems first,' they say. 'But if we
succeed, by 2000 it will be Europe knocking on Turkey's door, not the other
way round.' That second part of the proposition remains hard to swallow.
Perhaps by then Turkey's high growth rate - 9.2 per cent last year - will
have significantly narrowed the gap between its purchasing power and the EC
average, at present a ratio of roughly one to three.
Perhaps the birth rate will have begun to fall. (But hardly enough to change
the expectation that Turkey will 'eventually have a bigger population than
any Community member state', to which the European Commission referred with
some alarm in its avis on Turkey's membership application in December 1989.)
Perhaps Turkish inflation - 60 per cent last year - will have been brought
under control.
Perhaps public opinion in western Europe will by then have grasped the
economic case for opening the EC labour market to able-bodied people from
relatively backward countries, willing to do the low-paid jobs that no
longer find indigenous takers, and able, through their social security
contributions, to support the growing number of old age pensioners.
Perhaps the prejudice with which so many west Europeans currently regard
their Moslem fellow-citizens will have been so far overcome that they will
welcome a Moslem country as a leading member of the EC. ('To embrace
Turkey,' says Mr Ozal's book, 'Europe's view of her own history will need to
be as secular and universal as ours is.')
Perhaps the Cyprus problem will have been solved, and Greece will therefore
have lifted the veto it currently imposes even on the release of agreed EC
aid to Turkey, let alone Turkish membership.
Perhaps freedom of expression and association will have been guaranteed to
all Turkish citizens, including those who campaign by non-violent methods
for Kurdish independence; and perhaps the humanitarian standards of Turkish
soldiers and policemen will be no worse than those of their counterparts
elsewhere in Europe. (There are signs, unfortunately, that this convergence
is occurring from both sides.)
All the above developments are highly desirable. Few of them are very
likely. The first two may not be more than marginally affected either way by
government decisions. The others require, as a necessary if not sufficient
condition, determined action by public authorities - some in Turkey, some in
the EC, some in both.
Up to now the general west European attitude has been to regard Turkey as an
insoluble problem, but one which could safely be left unsolved, especially
once the decline of the Soviet threat seemed to reduce its strategic
importance. The Gulf war, and Turkey's role in it, have made that attitude
more difficult to sustain. They have led, among other things, to renewed US
pressure on Europe to accommodate Turkey.
'Turkey has earned the right to join the EC,' an article in the current
issue of Foreign Affairs boldly asserts. More immediately, the US wishes to
see Turkey, as an important member of Nato, included in any attempt to
organise a 'European pillar' of the Atlantic Alliance, for instance through
the Western European Union. This pressure is hotly resented by those, such
as the French government, who wish WEU to develop, if at all, as an arm of
the future European Political Union rather than of Nato. They hope to see
WEU membership sooner or later coincide with that of the EC, and they do not
regard the membership of these European bodies as being any business of the
US. Britain, by contrast, opposes any expansion of WEU membership for the
time being, and especially any suggestion that Greece be admitted while
Turkey is kept out.
Europeans are right to feel their institutions should not be treated as mere
adjuncts of Nato, but wrong if that leads them to ignore Turkey's role in a
European 'defence identity' which seems likely to be called on to manifest
itself, if anywhere, in the Middle East and/or the Balkans. Turkey's views
should be taken seriously in any discussion of future European security
arrangements, and the question of its relationship to the future European
Union cannot be left to fester.
Hard though it is to believe that all the obstacles to Turkish EC membership
could be removed within the next nine years, that does not mean we should
wait nine years before even attempting to solve them. A more positive
approach would be an open-ended negotiation on all the issues. In this,
Turkey and the EC together would seek to define the long-term relationship
that would best suit both their interests; the stages by which it could be
reached; and the conditions to be fulfilled before proceeding from one stage
to the next. Perhaps, as with economic and monetary union among the 12, they
should also assign a target date or deadline to each successive stage.
Geographically speaking, Turkey is in eastern Europe; and for Turks, as for
other east Europeans, membership of the EC is not a purely economic matter.
It is the anchor by which they hope to attach themselves to the democratic
industrialised world. If western Europe were to say 'yes' unconditionally
the device would not work. Happily there is no danger of that. But it will
fail equally certainly, and perhaps disastrously, if western Europe shows no
interest and has nothing to offer.

FT  08 MAY 91 / A failed connection: Government commitment to telecoms
competition appears to be wavering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Less than two months after the government launched its telecommunications
white paper, the new policy is beginning to look frayed at the edges.
The white paper proclaimed that the exclusive rights to provide mainstream
telephone services - previously held by British Telecom and its smaller
rival Mercury Communications - would be abolished and the market would be
opened to new competitors. Now, the companies which were expected to provide
that competition - cable television operators, mobile communications
companies and utilities such as British Rail - are accusing the government
and the regulator, the Office of Telecommunications (Oftel), of selling out
to pressure from BT. Mercury is also unhappy, although it is keeping a low
profile in the belief that its influence will be greater if it works behind
closed doors.
The cause of the rumpus is the arcane, but vital, issue of interconnection
charges - how much competitors must pay if they use BT's network to pick up
or deliver calls. BT has the only network covering the whole of the UK and
its rivals are therefore dependent in almost all cases, on BT's carrying
calls for at least part of their journey.
The competitors argue that the proposed interconnection fees are so
swingeing that their profit margins will be squeezed and their ability to
compete with BT undermined.
The dispute may also have tarnished the impressive reputation of Sir Bryan
Carsberg, director-general of Oftel. He had come to be regarded as a
fair-minded defender of both consumers and competitors against the
near-monopoly power of BT, which still has 95 per cent of the market.
'There is concern that Carsberg's credibility is being undermined because he
has caved in to BT,' says Mr Peter Borer, managing director of British Rail
Telecommunications.
There has been speculation both in the industry and in the City of London
that the government has abandoned its tough line on introducing competition
because it is anxious to maximise the value of its 49 per cent stake in BT,
which it plans to privatise in the current financial year.
Ms Maev Sullivan, Mercury's director of legal and regulatory affairs,
describes the white paper as the 'BT prospectus'.
Oftel's proposals for the interconnection fees consist of two elements: the
first, a conveyance charge, would compensate BT for the costs of carrying a
competitor's call, plus a reasonable profit; the second, the 'access
deficit' charge, is designed to compensate BT for the fact that it runs
unprofitable local networks. The idea is that BT has to keep its call
charges higher than they would otherwise be in order to subsidise line
rental charges which are lower than their costs. The intention is that
competitors should make a similar subsidy to BT's local network whenever
they use it.
Oftel has produced illustrative figures suggesting that competitors might
have to pay BT 0.3p a minute for local calls, 1.8p a minute for national
calls and 11.6p a minute for international calls under the access deficit
arrangement.
Oftel's proposals have been attacked on five main grounds:
The whole matter is being decided behind closed doors. Oftel is planning to
determine the final interconnection rates on the basis of figures presented
by BT, but these will not be open to public scrutiny. BT argues that its
access deficit is Pounds 2bn a year, an estimate that competitors view as
wildly exaggerated.
Professor Bill Letwin of the London School of Economics argues that Oftel
should hold public hearings. He says this would allow independent experts to
challenge the assumptions on which Oftel bases its conclusions.
Competitors are being forced to subsidise BT's inefficiency. The complaint
is that the interconnection charges are to be based on BT's actual costs
rather than the costs that would be incurred by an efficient operator.
Mr Alan Harper, business strategy director of Unitel, one of the new breed
of mobile communications networks, argues that this 'passes on to us
inefficiencies in the BT system'.
There should be no access deficit charge, only a conveyance fee. Mercury
says that, under its existing interconnection agreement, it already pays a
fair share of BT's costs of providing lines.
If the new proposals stand, says Mr Peter van Cuylenberg, Mercury's chief
executive, 'we will end up paying twice for the same elements of BT's
network'.
BT argues that an access deficit payment is necessary because it is not free
to increase its line rental charges to cover the cost of providing them - a
process known as rebalancing. The result is that competitors can undercut BT
on long-distance and international calls because they do not bear the same
burden.
Mr Nick Measham, a telecommunications analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the
stockbroker, says that the solution to the dispute is for the government to
'stop being cowards and remove the constraints on rebalancing'.
There is no meaningful way of calculating an access deficit. Because it is
impossible to make a call without a telephone line and there is not much
point in having lines unless one wishes to make calls, it is pointless to
try to allocate BT's costs between its services, the argument goes.
Oftel's new critics are fond of pointing out that Sir Bryan made the same
point himself in a speech last year, when he argued that 'attempts to
quantify any cross-subsidy between calls and exchange lines are unlikely to
yield any meaningful answers'. Sir Bryan, however, now seems to be doing
just that.
No account is taken of the benefits that BT gets from easy access to
customers. Oftel proposes to calculate the access deficit by taking BT's
revenue from connection and line rental charges and then subtracting the
costs of providing lines.
But competitors say that customers with BT lines tend by default to use BT
for carrying their calls. BT also has the chance to sell its customers
sophisticated new services and equipment - something not available to its
competitors.
'BT still controls the customer at the end of the line. It wants us to pay
the costs but not get these benefits,' says Unitel's Mr Harper.
Although Sir Bryan has refused to discuss the interconnection dispute, he
plans to publish a paper clarifying his policy in the next two weeks.
Mercury, for one, hopes this will lead to significant modifications of the
arrangements.
Other potential competitors say they have been reassured by Sir Bryan's
argument that the current interconnection proposals will only be an interim
arrangement, as the whole matter will be up for review in 1993. There have
even been suggestions that the issue could be investigated by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission at that stage.
Such suggestions, however, only serve to reinforce the idea that the
government is concerned to have a quick fix now to help it sell the rest of
its shares in BT. But it would be better to get the system right first time.
New shareholders, after all, might feel misled if they bought shares in the
company on one prospectus only to discover that the regulations were
tightened once the sale was made.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Letter: Innovation - the government's role and industry's
challenge (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From D E MIDGLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Baxter's report ('CBI finds upbeat outlook on R&amp;D', April 23)
implies a major conflict between the CBI's second annual innovation trends
survey and the recent House of Lords' report on innovation in manufacturing
industry. My own conclusion is that both documents present a similar picture
 -disquieting yet challenging.
The CBI report can hardly be described as upbeat when 37 per cent of the UK
manufacturing companies surveyed considered their spending on innovation to
be inadequate to meet future competitive pressures. Also, this figure
understates the problem because:
a further 8 per cent were apparently unsure about the adequacy of their
spending on innovation;
the survey reflects subjective judgments, when there is still too much
complacency in many sections of British manufacturing industry about future
foreign competition;
if nearly half Britain's manufacturing should fail for want of investment in
innovation, much of the remainder would be threatened because of
interdependence.
So although the CBI survey contains crumbs of comfort about investment in
the development of new products, processes and services, it can hardly claim
to rebutt the main thrust of the Lords' report, which is well researched,
clearly written and worthy of proper study. The superficial rubbishing of
the latter in the financial columns seems sadly to reflect social and
political prejudices rather than constructive ideas and objective analysis.

<TEXT>
Sir, For many years those of us who manage manufacturing companies have
realised the importance of innovation to our companies' competitive
performance. Your leader, 'And Ridley Begat Lilley' (May 1), stressing the
need to improve innovation, will therefore encourage those of us trying to
gain a competitive advantage by incorporating new products and processes
into our business and financial policies. More welcome was your call for the
DTI actively to promote and encourage innovation.
You are right - government can influence a number of areas which have an
important bearing on innovation; chief among these is the skills training
needed to implement the technology. Also, government can encourage
collaborative R&amp;D with industry, even entering into partnerships. The DTI
can provide product and technical information, lay dawn compatibility and
standards policy, better protect intellectual property and encourage the
financial institutions to consider product development as an important
objective and invest in it long term. However, given the record of the DTI
over the last 10 years your call will fall on deaf ears.
How refreshing, therefore, to turn the page of the same edition and find Mr
Gordon Brown - a Labour MP - explaining that under a Labour government the
DTI would actively apply itself to these matters by which government can so
influence innovation.
The conclusion must be that Labour's industrial policies deserve more
sympathetic consideration and support.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Letter: Balance sheet strength should be priority over
short-term earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILIP GIBBS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The recent proposals by the Accounting Standards Board are to be
welcomed in seeking to narrow the range of profit and loss items appearing
as extraordinary. Far too many companies have been trying to uphold earnings
per share by treating abnormal losses as extraordinary.
In particular many companies have for years been taking profits above the
line on activities only then to treat costs of closure as below the line.
On the other hand, ASB proposals are going severely to limit the usefulness
of earnings per share in valuing companies. Large distortions will arise
from profits or losses on disposal of big assets or termination of
operations.
Valuations based on balance sheets and brand names will be given added
significance. In this context, I am surprised it has not been suggested that
companies should give figures for assets per share (excluding goodwill) when
revealing earnings per share.
A concentration on balance sheet strength rather than short term earnings
could, incidentally, be very beneficial to industry and might help to avoid
further collapses such as have been seen in service-based businesses in the
past few years.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Arts: Wildest Dreams - Scarborough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM MULFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the first time that I have seen an Alan Ayckbourn play on his home
ground of Scarborough. Ideas, jokes and characters in the Stephen Joseph
Theatre in the Round pop up all over the place, which is what Ayckbourn is
about. Wildest Dreams is his 42nd full-length play. It is a bit long and
doubtless will be refined before reaching London, but it is still worth
seeing in its raw state. The basic idea is to juxtapose a quasi-supernatural
board game with someone playing a more sophisticated game on a computer.
Eventually they may hit the same target, though what that is remains
obscure.
'The Game,' as it is called, consists of four players sitting round a board
with a set of primitive figures. Between them the players and the figures
may move as the spirit takes. It is is played regularly every Thursday
evening under the aegis of the schoolteacher, Stanley Inchbridge, and his
wife, Hazel. Or at least it is until an outsider intervenes in the form of
the blonde, Marcie Banks, for whom Stanley falls. Hazel reacts by reverting
to babyhood.
In the background, one of the younger players is communing with spirits
through his computer. There is a good deal about family relations, though it
is not always clear who is related to whom and how. Hazel and Stanley regret
not having had children of their own: perhaps the game is a substitute.
Stanley also has a curious brother-in-law called Austen who appears to have
jinxed their honeymoon by following them round the Norfolk Broads with a
camera. Austen pursues Stanley, the English teacher, still with a series of
linguistic challenges like what is the other meaning of the word 'fugue'.
The brother-in-law subsequently disappears from the plot for no very obvious
reason.
On another part of the stage is a breaking marriage. Marcie, the blonde, is
taking refuge from a pugilistic husband. She says in passing, again for no
obvious reason, that both her parents are MPs. A further mystery is the
house wherein she finds herself. It appears to belong to an old schoolfriend
 -one of the players of the game - who has inherited it from her family, but
chooses to live in the basement; the computer whizz-kid lives up in an
attic. More family symbolism, no doubt.
If you ask how all this all this hangs together, the answer is 'loosely'.
There is plainly a link between the primitive nature of the game and the
hi-tech almost extraterrestial pursuits of the computer. Equally there is a
kind of dyslexic linguistic game going leading to confusions between tumulus
and cumulus and a splendid of-the-cuff definition of 'punctilious':
nit-picking. An orgu, we learn, is a 'hardy specimen of limited
intelligence, either discarded or occasionally kept as a pet'.
Perhaps intelligence, in the pure sense of the word, is the theme. Ayckbourn
has used modern technology on stage before: the electronics in his first
London play, Mr Whatnot. Appropriately this production is sponsored by ICI
Computer Systems Ltd. Barry McCarthy as Stanley is a wonderfully puzzled
schoolmaster. Rebecca Lacey does her best to make sense of the wholly
incomprehensible part of Marcie. Ayckbourn directs.

As we move towards the millennium it looks more and more probable that the
main cause of international tension, instead of the politics of the Cold
War, could be that old Hollywood plot favourite, water rights. Israel has
given up the Sinai which has oil but no water, but the same is not true of
the West Bank and the Golan Heights: they have water which is vital for
Israel. Syria, Turkey and Iraq are locked into a major disagreement over the
uses of the Euphrates, a water course with significance dating from the
Bible and beyond. BBC2 investigates these modern feuds in Water Wars (8.10).
That is followed by the consistently outstanding MASH (9.00) and then the
first part of an Australian mini-series about a newspaper tycoon: The Paper
Man (9.25) .....Australian newspaper tycoon? There's no such thing, surely?
The story of the Soviet Union's most important Cold War turncoat, Oleg
Penkovsky, is told by ace spy-chaser Tom Bower in BBC1's Inside Story
(9.30). Channel 4 offers yet another introduction to its Satyajit Ray season
in Movie Masterclass (11.45) where Mamoun Hassan gives a shot by shot
analysis of that marvellous film 'The World Of Apu'.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Arts: Glyndebourne goes ahead with rebuilding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Glyndebourne announced yesterday that it was going ahead with its plan to
build a new theatre. It has already secured three quarters of the Pounds 33m
needed, mainly in pledges from the corporate sector, and it will now
concentrate on selling itself to overseas businessmen.
Preparatory work has started on constructing access to the new auditorium,
which will increase the seating capacity from 830 to 1150 and thus help to
ensure the financial future of Glyndebourne. There will be no Festival in
1993 and the 1992 Glyndebourne will be slightly curtailed to enable the
re-building, involving a completely new theatre, to proceed speedily.
Companies donating money will be members of the Glyndebourne Festival
Society from 1994-2013, which confers priority booking for tickets. A
contribution of Pounds 90,000 ensures the maximum of 120 seats in a season,
although never more than eight on one night. Any existing corporate member
unwilling to finance the new building loses automatic access to
Glyndebourne. The share of the house allocated to the business sector will
rise to 35 per cent of capacity. In the past it has never exceeded 34 per
cent.
But there will also be tickets set aside at each performance for members of
the general public who are not members of the Society as well as forty
standing places. There will be a wider range of price levels, although the
cost of the most expensive seats will increase in line with inflation.
The new theatre, with a much improved acoustic, will rise on a 180 degree
axis from the existing structure. The autumn season by Glyndebourne Touring
Opera will be unaffected by the rebuilding.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Arts: New look for the merry month of May - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Early May is scarcely a time when you expect television to be screening lots
of new material, yet every day in the past week has brought at least one new
series (not another batch of some grizzled old sitcom, tagged 'NEW]' in the
programme magazines like an ancient detergent, but genuinely fresh series)
and some nights have provided several.
WEDNESDAY. Fans of the funniest game show on television, Whose Line Is It
Anyway, will have looked forward to Josie since we were promised Josie
Lawrence was being 'let loose on her own comedy series'. WLIIA? has
established a whole string of new(ish) comedians as very special people:
those who can think fast enough on their feet to be really funny while
improvising. Few have the gift to achieve this consistently, but Josie
Lawrence was one. Astute readers of the runes may have guessed what was in
store when La Lawrence began complaining in the hype interviews preceding
Episode 1 that people would keep asking whether her shows were to be like
Tracey Ullman's or Emma Thompson's and they jolly well weren't going to be
like either so shuttup or I'll scweam and scweam till I'm thick, I can you
know.
Unhappily the first show looked as though it had been modelled precisely
half and half on Ullman and Thompson (neither of whom managed in their shows
to approach the unvaryingly high standard of Victoria Wood or even the
occasional brilliance of French and Saunders). Lawrence's impression of
Kylie Minogue was not so good that one could forget Kylie is currently a
back number and her sister is the one in the limelight. For the rest it was
all too clear that a flair for improvisation is no guarantee of talent in
other areas.
Channel 4 is following that with a series showing excerpts from Manhattan
Cable, the New York service which combines cable technology and the freedom
of expression required under the American constitution to provide the most
astonishing public access channel on earth. Anyone who has sat in New York
and watched it for more than a couple of nights knows that the Bible
thumping grows boring only slightly sooner than the explicit sex. (Why are
they all so desperately sleazy?) Yet sliced up into miniature portions for
these British compilations it all looks fascinatingly zany rather than
tediously insane.
Easily the best of the new Wednesday series is BBC2's Water Wars which began
with a programme that proved comprehensively how important this subject is,
and how much more so it may rapidly become. The winning by American Indians
of water rights on their land, the competition between cities and farmers
for water, the broking of water rights and water itself, were all conveyed
with abnormal clarity by a combination of good pictures and a good script
(though the large proportion of the population with hearing that is
impaired, however slightly, will have hated the parts where music interfered
with speech).
THURSDAY. Birdscape on Channel 4 is described as 'a new series in which
wildlife artist and naturalist Bruce Pearson travels around Britain to paint
its birdlife'. The surprise in Episode 1 was that we saw so little of the
painting, though perhaps you could see why: the fens, with those huge pale
blue northern winter skies, the navy blue water beneath, and the vivid
yellow sedge and reed between, decorated with thousands of geese, swans and
duck, looked so magnificent that it would have been somewhat absurd to turn
away to look at paintings.
FRIDAY. Those who missed the opening episode of ITV's sitcom Second Thoughts
can decide for themselves whether to begin with Episode 2. James Bolam is a
divorce with no children but a Sloane Ranger ex wife. He is hoping to marry
Lynda Bellingham who seems to have no husband but two teenage children. The
opening exchange (in bed) was: 'I'm usually in Sainsbury's about now' -
'Well think of me as this week's special offer'. The writers were so proud
of a later line given to Bellingham, 'Could we have four sundaes with
crushed nuts' accompanied by a look clearly threatening Bolam's manhood,
that they used it twice.
SATURDAY. Tracey Ullman came to the fore 10 years ago in a BBC showcase
series called Three Of A Kind. The men in that programme were David
Copperfield and Lenny Henry. Now BBC1 has launched You Gotta Be Jokin'
(titles have deteriorated in a decade) featuring five young comedians: Maddi
Cryer, Annette Law, George Marshall, Billy Pearce and Shane Richie.
Presumably the hope is that, once again, most of them will go rocketin' to
stardom, though if it is passe to do impressions of Kylie Minogue what can
you say about an impression of Millie singing 'My Boy Lollipop'? That
reached its highest point in the British charts, number two, 27 years ago
last month. The funniest item in this opening programme was Annette Law's
impression of Penelope Keith performing a medley of rap numbers in her Margo
persona. It will be a surprise if more than one from this group makes it
into the big time.
Each of them, however, is funnier than the whole of The Wolvis Family put
together . . . at least, I think so. This BBC2 series is the sort of thing
that sounds wonderful at 'offers meetings' (where BBC department heads
consider offers for new programmes) since it is so simple: the members of a
family sit on chairs in a bare studio and undergo group therapy led by a
sickeningly trendy and somewhat dense therapist, the sort who wags his
fingers in the air like a Hampstead hostess to denote 'quotes'. There was a
small improvement towards the end of the first episode, so the series may
bear more watching.
SUNDAY. Six one-hour programmes on mankind's development and use of maps
sounds like a splendid idea: an under explored topic, yet an unusually
visual one, and lots of scope for modern technology (what fun to mix through
from, say, a mediaeval impression of Europe to the real shape of the land as
photographed from a satellite; why ever didn't they do it?) Unhappily in
ITV's The Shape Of The World the idea has been spoiled by a poor script, an
intrusive commentary, and a lack of the sort of narrative drive which is so
well exemplified by Water Wars.
The script is littered with cliche: what do you call an old map kept by an
old man who brings it out once a year? A time honoured possession. What does
the sun do in hot weather? It beats down. How does it beat down?
Remorselessly. And so on. Where commentary is concerned they have made the
oldest mistake in the documentary book and had it read by an actor with an
idiosyncratic voice. Patrick Stewart is fine in Hamlet or Star Trek but the
minute you hide his face and ask him to communicate via voice alone he does
what so many actors do and goes over the top. He is by turns arch, plummy
and portentous but always noticeable - which is the last thing you want.
MONDAY. In Watching The Detectives Channel 4 seems determined to convince us
not only that the television image of the work done by such people as
Holmes, Morse and Poirot is utterly unrealistic, but that the lives of real
detectives are narcoleptically boring. The opening episode established this
in the first 10 minutes and spent the next 50 challenging us to stay awake
as the camera watched the wet streets of Manchester from a car which was
following a stolen kitchen cabinet that we were never allowed to see. As a
dramatic climax our Manchester sleuth switched to following (still in his
car) a wife who was going to meet either her boyfriend or a business
colleague - but we were never allowed to see her either.
TUESDAY. Big Break on BBC1 is one of those game shows that you start
watching through barely parted fingers because the host, comedian Jim
Davidson, is from the 'Goodness me what a prat we have here' school, made so
familiar by Bruce Forsyth. Then, when he asks one of the contestants 'Is a
Concorde or a 737 the fastest passsenger plane?' and she replies 'Yes' you
take his point, and remove your fingers. This is the 914th variation on
'Beat The Clock' to appear since Sunday Night At The London Palladium was
axed, though this time the game is always snooker. Why don't they simply
revive 'Beat The Clock'?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A second look at David Bintley's new Cyrano on Monday night did not bring
any greater pleasure than at the premiere. Indeed, once the element of
novelty has gone, there is even less to recommend about a piece whose
vulgarity of means and choreographic weediness are very worrying. This
Cyrano is ballet for people who can't be bothered with ballet. It is ballet
as production ideas and mime; ballet as vampire, feeding from its
interpreters; ballet as knock-about farce to a knock-about score. It is,
ultimately, ballet on the terms of indifferent musical comedy - not Cole
Porter, but Lloyd Webber.
Wilfred Joseph's score does not stand up to a second hearing, with its
fragmentary air and its blatancies - exact though it is in matching the
choreography's failings. The design by Hayden Griffin succeeds in clouding
the action in cloaks and ballooning breeches and long dresses whose tedious
verismo is in marked contrast to the balletic savoir-faire shown by Nicholas
Georgiadis in Mayerling and Manon. In a curious and disquieting way, this
Cyrano places ballet - and the Royal Ballet in particular - in an aesthetic
limbo, far removed from the obvious lineage which led from Petipa to Ashton
and thence to MacMillan. It denies ballet as an art concerned with movement
expressive or brilliant. Cyrano is production as justification for jokiness,
posturing and sentimentality.
Monday night's performance brought the debuts of Irek Mukhamedov as Cyrano,
Viviana Durante as Roxane, and Stuart Cassidy as Christian. The young lovers
were as beguiling as their roles allow, and I admire their artistry very
much. Mukhamedov cannot give an indifferent performance, and he seeks to
show Cyrano's inner life, but throughout the evening I was conscious that
this was the great artist who could storm in glory as Ivan the Terrible, and
Spartacus, and play with consummate sensitivity as des Grieux or Albrecht or
Lescaut. His Cyrano is the merest shadow of these, and the fault is not
Mukhamedov's.
This week's performances mark the 20th anniversary of the Midland Bank Proms
at the Opera House. Long may they continue, and long may the bank have our
gratitude for such enlightened sponsorship.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Arts: The Brighton Festival's opening events
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Brighton Festival is here again - a gaudy, striped umbrella covering all
sorts of things, mixed by Gavin Henderson, the artistic director, with a
flair which eludes most festivals trying to be genuinely popular as well as
genuinely cultural. The programme deserves and indeed requires a beady
search for quieter pleasures half-hidden among the jumble of comics, pop
art, jazz, dance and drama.
Evening recitals in the Pavilion, chamber concerts at All Saints Church in
Hove during which the Chilingirian Quartet play three of Mozart's superb
String Quintets, a much better way of celebrating the bicentenary than going
on and on doing the usual operas, are among the safe havens. In the final
week Brighton incorporates the Charleston Festival, commemorating the 50th
anniversary of Virginia Woolf's death. The enterprising New Sussex Opera
will give the European premiere of Kurt Weill's Lost in the Stars, one of
his American works.
Through most of this there runs an American thread: Ives, Ruggles, Copland,
Barber and MacDowell occur in concerts programmes. At the first big musical
event in the Dome on Sunday, a Europe Day Concert with the BBC Symphony
Orchestra under Alexander Lazarev from the Bolshoi in Moscow, gave the place
of honour to Ives's Second Symphony. They preceded it with a performance of
the Academic Festival Overture of Brahms of such muscular attack (for once
the work sounded more festive than academic) that the presumable intention
of showing how the two composers made different use of popular tunes
misfired. In the event Ives's homespun scoring in this work made even sober
Brahms sound like Rimsky-Korsakov. The meditative movements, like deeply
felt gropings towards as yet unwritten works of Vaughan Williams, came off
best. The free-for-all ending was fun when it came.
This was two concerts in one, the second half consisting of three excerpts
from Gotterdammerung with Lazarev, a conductor of distinctive talent,
demonstrating why Wagner wanted, and got, a sunken orchestra pit at
Bayreuth. In the Dome orchestral colours come at you hot and strong without
blending. To the broad-river view of Wagner, Lazarev prefers abrupt phrasing
and short paragraphs. Conductor and orchestra were not kind to the soprano
soloist, Anne Evans. On stage and with a sunken orchestra, this experienced
Brunnhilde doubtless makes a very different impression. Here, though the
grasp of music and words was unmistakable, the voice barely rode the
orchestra and at the end was almost submerged.
Since the sleazy Dome plays an important role in the Festival, can't they do
something about the interior? It looked a little less depressing this year,
but can there be any major European city with Brighton's pretensions where
the appalling vulgarity of the skimpy false-proscenium curtains and ironwork
screen at the back of the stage, swearing vilely with the biscuit-brown
seating, would be tolerated? There is much to be said for riotous bad taste,
nothing for ignorance, indifference, and no taste at all.
The virtues (decoration apart) of the wide open stage and friendly enclosing
circle were shown on the opening night when the National Theatre, on a rare
visit to the South Coast, brought Tony Harrison's version of what has been
recovered of the Sophoclean satyr-play here called The Trackers of
Oxyrhynchus. Neither Sophocles nor Harrison are this reviewer's business,
yet I must say that, aided by a score for two amplified percussion players
by Stephen Edwards which provided no more and no less than was required and
by the rhythmic verse-chanting and clog-dancing of the satyr-chorus this
made an unexpectedly stimulating evening of opera-ballet.
That the clogs were hellish loud (like those equally insufferable
tormentors, castanets, they are meant to be heard out of doors) was a minor
inconvenience. But the evening was too long. Mozart would have had the
cutting scissors out in no time - and of course, he would have felt
perfectly at home with the four-letter words which Harrison uses to the
point of diminishing returns. But the show took one a great deal further
than most designedly 'music theatre' occasions.

FT  08 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Poll puts interest in job above
earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEES are more concerned about whether their jobs are interesting and
secure than they are about pay and benefits, according to a Mori poll
commissioned by the GMB general union.
The poll findings are intended to influence debate about priorities at a
special conference due to be held today on the future of the Trades Union
Congress. The GMB said the survey gave a clear warning that only 1 in 20
people counted working for an organisation with a strong trade union as
important in a job.
The two factors, out of a total of 21, that were considered most important
in a job, were: whether the work was interesting and enjoyable (62 per
cent); and whether it was secure (59 per cent).
A feeling of having accomplished something worthwhile (46 per cent) was
rated third, and basic pay (38 per cent) ranked fourth. Among women
employees, basic pay ranked seventh. Fringe benefits were valued highly by
only 6 per cent.
Having a chance to learn skills and develop abilities was important to 33
per cent of those polled but was negotiated in only 20 per cent of
workplaces, said the union.
Mr John Edmonds, GMB general secretary, said trade unions in the 1980s had
been pushed back into a corner and had accepted that they could talk to
employers only on a limited range of issues.
'Our poll shows that to survive in the 1990s we have got to widen our
approach to bargaining,' he said.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Syndicates expected to accept probe at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL hundred Names in the Lloyd's of London insurance market, who were
members of the loss-making Feltrim syndicates, are today expected to reject
legal action in their attempt to recoup one of the biggest losses in Lloyd's
history.
Instead the Names are likely to agree to the establishment of an independent
Lloyd's investigation into the circumstances of the losses, making use of a
new facility announced last week by Lloyd's in response to mounting
criticism from Names.
The decision should temporarily alleviate pressure on the authorities at the
troubled insurance market, but Names are insisting that the investigation be
thorough and are refusing to rule out the possibility of legal action
eventually,
Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names Association, said there were 'a
lot of questions to be answered' about the regulation and management of the
Feltrim syndicates, which specialised in catastrophe reinsurance. 'A number
of glaring inadequacies have come to light,' he said.
Two thousand Names on syndicates 540/542 and 847, formerly managed by the
Feltrim Underwriting Agency, expect to lose more than Pounds 320m on
business written in 1987, 1988 and 1989. Names with an average commitment of
between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 30,000 are facing losses of between Pounds
150,000 and Pounds 200,000 each.
Syndicate 540's results were worst in 1989 when 547 recorded a loss
equivalent to 300 per cent of its annual stamp capacity - the maximum amount
of premium it is permitted to write.
The Council of Lloyd's agreed on Wednesday to set up a special investigation
to examine the commercial circumstances of all losses exceeding 150 per cent
of a syndicate's annual stamp capacity.
Mr Hook welcomed the move, which he said had been made 'in response to an
initiative from the Feltrim Names'. He said any investigation would have to
be 'genuinely independent'.
The Names are concerned about the way members' agents at Lloyd's continued
to channel Names into the Feltrim syndicates during 1988 and 1989, in spite
of indications that Feltrim was badly affected by catastrophes such as the
October 1987 storms and the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recent rise in house sales has yet to find its way through to increased
output by house builders, according to figures published yesterday by the
Environment Department.
The number of new homes started by private builders in the three months to
the end of March fell by 14 per cent compared with the corresponding period
last year.
Builders say the improvement in sales has occurred only recently and has
come too late to offset sharply lower sales in January and February. They
have been selling from stock rather than starting new construction in what
remains a fragile market in spite of reductions in interest rates.
The number of new homes started by builders in March fell to 12,600 from
15,400 last year.

<TEXT>
THE London Arena, the conference, sporting and conference venue in
Docklands, has gone into receivership with debts of more than Pounds 20m,
Vanessa Houlder writes.
Security Pacific, the project's principal banker, yesterday appointed Mr
Jonathan Phillips and Mr Mark Homan, partners in Price Waterhouse, as
administrative receivers of Arena Developments (Europe) Ltd (Adel), the
majority of which is owned by Mr Frank Warren, the boxing promoter, and his
partner, Mr John Botros.
The Arena attracted insufficient events to survive, even though the events,
which ranged from professional wrestling to a concert by Pavarotti, were
sometimes well supported. It was handicapped by bad publicity and the delay
in building up infrastructure in Docklands.
The under-use of its facilities, together with construction cost overruns
and the cost of safety regulations brought in after the Bradford Football
Club disaster, severely handicapped cash flow.
Mr Warren, chairman of Adel, said he had signed a sale and leaseback deal
with Occidental Financial and Holdings, an international industrial and
financial conglomerate represented by Mr Larry Gillick, on April 17. 'I
expect this transaction to complete as contracted,' he said.

patterns'
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EAST EUROPEAN countries must speed domestic reform, if they are to draw real
benefits from adjusting trade, William Dullforce in Geneva writes.
This advice comes from a symposium of 40 eastern and western economists
organised by the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) and the
Osteuropa-Institut and Sudost-Institut in Munich last year, and now in book
form*.
Trade reform in isolation is deceptively easy, the economists warn.
Enterprises can be granted rights to import and export on their own, and
foreign currency auctions can be quickly set up. But without domestic
reforms, enterprises will not respond to enhanced export opportunities and
more realistic exchange rates.
Cuts in central controls over trade seemed so far to have had only limited
effects in improving the quality of exports, the economists noted. They
favoured a shift from quotas and administrative curbs to conventional
tariffs on the import side. But they warned that partial reforms, such as
reducing limits on imports of intermediate goods while maintaining
protection for consumer goods, as in Poland, could be counter-productive, by
raising protection for domestic producers. Opinions differed on future
trading links in Comecon.

<TEXT>
THE US will soon reshuffle its senior State Department officials who deal
with European issues.
Mr Thomas Niles, US ambassador to the European Community, is expected to be
nominated shortly as the new Assistant Secretary for European and Canadian
affairs, in which job he would handle the review of US security relations
with Europe. He would take over from Mr Raymond Seitz, who has just become
US ambassador to Britain.
The 51-year-old Mr Niles is a highly experienced career diplomat, having
served in Belgrade, Moscow (twice), at Nato headquarters in Brussels and as
ambassador to Canada from 1985 to 1989, when he dealt with the US-Canadian
free trade agreement, as well as in various senior positions at the State
Department. He has held his present post for the past two years.
Mr Niles is to be succeeded in Brussels by Mr James Dobbins, now principal
deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of European and Canadian Affairs,
who deals with many European issues. Aged 48, he has served in various State
Departments posts in the US, Paris, London, and Bonn, where he was deputy
chief of mission from 1985 to 1989.

FT  08 MAY 91 / World Trade News: British companies reap benefits of
Japanese markets - Their success owes much to a change in attitude to doing
business there
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHILE prominent US companies campaign for a bigger slice of the Japanese
market, a growing number of UK companies, both large and small, are quietly
reaping the benefits of success in what is arguably the world's most
competitive market.
Last year, UK exports to Japan rose 16 per cent to Pounds 2.63bn from Pounds
2.26bn in 1989, against an increase in overall imports to Japan of 11.2 per
cent to Dollars 234.6bn (Pounds 138bn), according to the Japanese finance
ministry.
In the past three years, visible exports from the UK to Japan rose by over
75 per cent, the UK Department of Trade and Industry says. The greater
headway British companies are beginning to make in Japan owes much to a
change in their attitude to doing business there, and an increasing
awareness of the wider benefits to be derived from being in the Japanese
market.
Market research commissioned by the DTI shows that 28 per cent of UK
companies surveyed saw Japan as their first or second most important market,
against 13 per cent five years ago. The DTI says Japan has become the UK's
third biggest export market, after western Europe and the US.
Given that Japan has the highest per capita GDP among the Group of Seven
industrialised countries, it is not surprising that UK companies have made
strenuous efforts to break into the Japanese market. The success of British
companies in Japan is not limited to the large companies such as Glaxo, or
even those with well-established marques either.
For example, Teknek Electronics, a small company making a precision machine
that cleans sheet materials in the printed circuit industry saw Japanese
sales grow by almost 500 per cent last year. The group was able to do this
despite its major competitor in the market being a Japanese machine.
Solid State Logic is a relatively young company which makes professional
audio equipment - another area where Japanese manufacturers are gaining
prominence. Yet in the 20 months since it set up its Japanese subsidiary, it
has seen sales to Japan jump 60 per cent from Pounds 4m to Pounds 6.4m a
year.
Foseco, the specialty chemicals maker, acquired by Burmah Castrol at the end
of last year, has seen sales of its Japanese subsidiary surge from Y5.8bn
(Pounds 24.5m) in 1989 to Y6.2bn last year, up from Y4.3bn in 1986.
In the consumer market, Scholl, the footwear and health care products group,
last year sold 2.8m pairs of its 'healthy' support tights in the first year
it introduced the product to the Japanese market. This was achieved despite
Scholl not being as much a brand name in Japan as in other markets.
The rise in UK exports to Japan owes something to the gradual disappearance
of that country's visible trade barriers. But while the non-tariff barriers
to trade - the group-oriented trading practices, convoluted distribution
system and the generally inscrutable ways that have been blamed for keeping
foreigners out - still exist, the recent success of UK companies probably
stems largely from a new willingness to meet the Japanese market on its own,
highly-competitive terms.
'While we treated the Japanese market as any other market it was not a
success,' admits Sir Paul Girolami, chairman of Glaxo, one of the winners of
this year's Opportunity Japan Awards, a programme sponsored by the DTI in
recognition of UK companies especially successful in Japan. It was only
after taking boardroom decisions that Glaxo's Japanese business began to
grow, Sir Paul adds.
Many UK companies are themselves starting to preach that having a
high-quality product to offer, a high level of commitment to the needs of a
specific market, an ability to respond efficiently to those needs, and an
understanding of the specific business culture, are key ingredients to
success in Japan in particular, and the rest of the world in general.
'You have to understand the different philosophy,' says Mr Mark Sunderland,
commercial manager of Teknek Electronics. Teknek found being defensive about
a product problem was the wrong reaction.
'The Japanese end-user said that if we had told them the equipment would
have problems after so many thousand hours, they would have worked around
it. Once they understood what the problem was, we could work together to
overcome it. It was the surprise element that they found difficult to
accept.'
It takes a high degree of commitment to the market, preferably through
direct representation at a fairly high level, to attain that kind of
understanding.
'It may seem daunting, but in the long run it is the key to success,' says
Mr Sunderland. Teknek, which employs 38 people, has an executive sales
representative who spends three weeks out of four touring Japan and the
Pacific Rim.
What has encouraged more and more UK companies to pay this kind of attention
to the needs of the Japanese market and undergo the rigours of being there,
is the spreading realisation of the technological and disciplinary benefits
thus derived which filter through to their operations elsewhere.
Foseco, for example, licensed a new casting technique it had developed, to a
Japanese partner. The Japanese company collaborated with Foseco in making
improvements to that technique, which were so useful that Foseco is now
considering marketing the improvements in other countries.
Cut-throat price competition, another feature of the Japanese market,
imposes a cost discipline that is universally applicable. 'It is a great
rarity for prices to increase in Japan,' according to Mr Martin Issot,
president of Foseco Japan.
'The western philosophy of annual price increase is totally unknown. This
has had a good and continuing 'competitive' influence on central research
and development functions.'
The group's Japanese subsidiary sold its Sedex filters at a loss for one
year while it set up local production to meet intense domestic price
competition.
It emerged from the ordeal with 55 per cent of the Japanese market, and a
reduction in production costs that has brought the sales price down by 30
per cent. Foseco Japan now sells three times as many different types and
sizes of Sedex filters as any Foseco company.
Many UK companies in Japan also benefit from Japanese technological
advances. Bowthorpe, the diversified electrical components maker, says it
uses prime technology developed in Japan, particularly involving robots, in
other factories worldwide.
But the greatest benefit could be that companies successful in marketing a
particular product in Japan find it easy to market that product in other
countries. 'The image that success in Japan can lead easily to success
elsewhere is very significant,' Mr Issot points out.
Sir David Plastow, chairman of Vickers, put it somewhat differently: 'If we
can't succeed there, we won't succeed at all.'

FT  08 MAY 91 / Washington seeks to prevent more rioting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WIDESPREAD rioting and looting - for the second night running in the
predominantly Hispanic area of Mount Pleasant in Washington, about two miles
from the White House - led to the imposition of a curfew and a state of
emergency across both that area and that of Adams Morgan between midnight
Monday and early yesterday morning.
The disturbances have involved gangs of youths breaking shop windows and
looting, fires, destruction of vehicles, and running skirmishes with a
thousand police officers who fired tear gas.
Calm prevailed yesterday as Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon gathered her top
administrators to discuss ways to prevent a third night of rioting.
Deputy Police Chief Edward Spurlock said the disturbances were the worst in
Washington since 1968, after the assassination of Martin Luther King jr, the
black civil rights leader.
The violence, though contained within a few hundred square yards, crossed
16th Street, one of the city's main arteries, and came within walking
distance of the main residential, tourist and office areas.
For most Washingtonians, however, the main evidence of the riots was the
live coverage on television, the screams of fire and ambulance sirens and
heavy activity by low-flying police helicopters.
The disturbances followed the shooting of a Hispanic man by a police officer
who was trying to detain him for public drinking. According to the police,
the man, now in a critical condition, drew a knife. According to a Hispanic
witness, he was handcuffed when shot.
This triggered the waves of violence against both property and the police on
Sunday and Monday evenings in the Mount Pleasant and Adams Morgan areas.
The latest events have underlined simmering tensions between the generally
poor Hispanic community and the District of Columbia government and police
force, which are predominantly black and, as such, reflect the city's racial
composition.
The tensions in Washington between Hispanics and blacks have been matched in
other US cities, such as Miami, Los Angeles and Houston, where there are
large Spanish-speaking populations, often made up of recent immigrants, who
argue that they are badly treated and often excluded from power.
Following the first night's riots, local residents told Ms Dixon that
Hispanic people were harassed by the police and poorly treated by city
agencies. Less than 4 per cent of the police are Hispanic, compared with at
least 10 per cent of the city's population. Many of the Hispanics are recent
refugees from central America and speak only Spanish.
Ms Dixon promised to improve communications and said district agencies would
hire more Hispanic people. This is her first big test since she took over
four months ago from Mayor Marion Barry, who, despite his drug and alcohol
problems, proved to be a wily operator in reducing conflicts in the city.
Sharon Pratt Dixon, mayor of Washington, who sometimes carries a broom as
token of her determination to clean up the city administration, has promised
more help for local Hispanics

FT  08 MAY 91 / Korean army conscripts to ease labour shortage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A GROWING labour shortage is prompting South Korea to look at ways in which
its armed forces can be conscripted for industrial service.
Two separate announcements yesterday included plans to use soldiers and men
doing military service for manufacturing and construction work.
Under the first proposal, drawn up by the Economic Planning Board and the
Construction Ministry, the government will allow more than 10,000 conscripts
to switch their military service for a five-year stint in industry.
Separately, Mr Roh Jai Bong, the prime minister, proposed that the army
corps of engineers be utilised to speed the construction of a new highway
between Seoul and the western port of Inchon.
A shortage of labour, particularly skilled labour, is causing increasing
concern in Korean industry. A recent report by the Labour Ministry estimated
that industry had a shortage of more than 190,000 workers last year and that
most of the shortage was in the manufacturing sector.
Korea's unemployment rate has been falling steadily and is now just 2.9 per
cent.
Under the plan to use military conscripts, selected soldiers will exchange
18 months of military service for their five years of work in industry. They
will be trained and paid by the company they work for but will not be
allowed to join trade unions.
'We are seeing a slower increase in population now and the number of people
able to work is increasing at a slower rate too,' said a spokesman for the
EPB.
The reserve conscripts are young people and this plan is one way of making
sure of a steady supply of skilled workers.'
He added that, if successful, the number of conscripts would be steadily
increased.

<TEXT>
THE inexperienced civilian government of Mrs Khaleda Zia yesterday called in
senior Bangladeshi army officers to help tackle the devastation caused by
last week's cyclone.
The army has ruled Bangladesh for most of its 21-year history and Mrs Zia
took office just two months ago. Although the new prime minister retains
control of the administration, steps have been initiated to 'improve
co-ordination' with senior officers.
Lt-Gen Nooruddin Khan, chief of the army staff, returned from a visit to
China over the weekend and has taken personal charge of relief and rescue
operations, although overall supervision remains with a central
co-ordination committee headed by Mrs Zia. The general has already held a
meeting with formation commanders.
By official count 125,730 people were killed and an estimated 10m left
homeless. A complete accounting of the dead is unlikely because many were
swept out to sea.
Mrs Zia yesterday told reporters that a 'master plan' for rehabilitation
work would be finalised within a couple of days and that rescue and relief
operations had now been intensified with an improvement in the weather.
In addition to the six helicopters being used by the government, 11 more
have arrived from India and other countries. However, there is now less need
for air drops of supplies as floods recede from most of the affected areas.
Since it is now possible to send medical teams to these areas, hopes are
that the much-feared epidemics will be controlled. But millions of survivors
continue to face shortages of food, drinking water and medicines so the next
few days will be crucial.
Chittagong port, which had been blocked by sunken vessels, was yesterday
declared partly open. This will enable the authorities to use the sea routes
for relief operations.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Donors agree to help India over payments crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN donors have started to raise short-term funds to India to help it
overcome its fiscal and balance of payments crisis, according to Mr Attila
Karaosmanoglu, the World Bank's vice-president for Asia.
Leading donors - including the World Bank, the IMF and the Asian Development
Bank - held an informal meeting in Vancouver on April 28 where Indian
officials presented a menu of short-term measures.
These included a 'candid assessment' of the current situation and action by
the Reserve Bank of India and finance ministry on monetary and budgetary
policy.
The promise to have ready for a new government 'a skeleton programme of
reforms' was so 'comforting' to the aid community that donors have begun to
raise the funds needed to help see India through next September, Mr
Karaosmanoglu said in an interview. India has an interim government pending
elections which start on May 20.
The Asian Development Bank promised Dollars 150m in emergency credit, which
Japan is expected to co-fin-ance. The Dutch government said it would make Fl
50m (Pounds 15m) available in quick disbursing finance. Britain and Germany
are expected to make other aid available. The US will keep food credits
available, and the US Export-Import Bank has said it will keep all its
windows open in India.
The aid will have an impact, Mr Karaosmanoglu said. But it is not certain if
it will be enough and in time.
India is anxious not to jeopardise its position as a nation which has never
defaulted on its obligations. The creditors have as great a stake in keeping
the waters calm. 'It is seen clearly that it is in nobody's interest to led
India go. It will be costly for the Indians and everybody else to pull them
out,' Mr Karaosmanoglu said.
For the long-term, the World Bank is making 'serious preparations' for a
programme of policy-based lending to India, if requested by the new
government. Tens of millions of dollars worth of 'quick-disbursing'
structural adjustment loans would provide the hard currency India needs.
The lending programme would put pressure on New Delhi to make the structural
changes necessary to achieve a more competitive industry and an improved
export performance.
In the past, Indian governments have strongly resisted the lure of
structural adjustment lending, preferring to go their own way on economic
policy. However, it is believed in Washington that the current crisis will
leave the new government little choice in the matter.
India's debt, about Dollars 70bn, (Pounds 41.4bn) is the third highest in
the developing world. It has only enough foreign exchange on hand to cover a
few weeks of imports, and the caretaker government has been unable to meet
the conditions for an emergency injection of International Monetary Fund
assistance.
Meanwhile, the World Bank has other means to help. The continued
depreciation of the rupee has meant a 'significant amount' of savings for
the bank in some of its projects. These savings will be converted into
usable funds for projects 'being implemented without problems'.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Indian Elections: Caste struggle strangles poor, corrupt
Bihar - State administration has broken down and violence is a threat to the
election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRIVING through the relentless heat of Bihar, one is soon made aware how
much this part of the northern Hindi belt has been engulfed in a power
struggle between castes, one that has already led to breakdown of the state
administration and which now threatens to drown India's election in
violence.
At Masaurhi, north of the Ganges and close to Muzaffarpur, a group of
harijans (untouchables) point to their bamboo and thatched homes that were
burnt down by local landlords a few days before. The harijans say they were
seeking an increase in their wages of Rs 3-10 (9-30p) a day.
Nearby landlords of the Bhumihar caste - the dominant upper caste in the
Muzaffarpur area - unite in a conspiracy of silence and say they know
nothing of the incident.
In Muzaffarpur itself, most colleges and universities - as elsewhere in
Bihar - are closed because teachers have not been paid for three or four
months. The Bihar state government, which has the reputation of being the
most corrupt and ill-managed in the country, has run out of funds.
Returning to Patna at night, we are regularly stopped by police checking for
arms. The local papers are full of reports of booming business among village
arms makers ahead of the election. Since campaigning began there have been
at least 50 political assassinations, which has raised the question of
whether the state will be brought under direct rule from Delhi before the
elections, due to take place during the week of May 20 to May 26.
'There is no administration in Bihar, no law and order,' says Mr Raganath
Pandey, a local Brahmin and former transport contractor who is the Congress
party's candidate. 'Nobody is safe.' His opponents laugh at this profession
of righteousness from a man who in the past has faced criminal charges and
whose election strength lies largely in the support he has from the region's
underworld bosses.
The founding fathers of Indian independence had hoped that caste differences
would melt away under the impact of development and modernisation. But in
Bihar, as in much of the Hindi-speaking belt of north India, the competition
for jobs and resources has hardened caste divisions.
The big battleground is between the traditionally dominant upper castes of
Brahmins, Bhumihars and Rajputs - and the increasingly aggressive farmer
castes of Yadavs, Kurmis and Keoris who are challenging their control over
the power and patronage of government.
This power struggle was intensified last year by former Prime Minister V P
Singh's announcement that 27 per cent of central government jobs would be
reserved for these so called 'backward castes'. Job reservation for the poor
 -a term used to embrace all the lower castes, untouchables and Moslems -
has since become the central plank of his Janata Dal party's election
campaign. This has earned Mr Singh the hatred of the upper castes.
A second factor that has deepened caste conflict in Bihar is that a backward
caste leader has taken over as chief minister of the state. In the year he
has been chief minister, Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav has openly deployed the power
and patronage of the state to his community's advantage.
Dr CPN Thakur, a leader of the Bhumihar community in Muzaffarpur, sums up
upper caste fears and resentments by saying: 'Everything is at stake. Life,
prestige and property.'
Muzaffarpur is a test case of this power struggle between castes because it
is a prestige constituency. It has sent national leaders to the parliament
in the past and has been the breeding ground of several national movements.
Mr George Fernandes, the former industry and railway minister and the Janata
Dal politician who most sees himself as a revolutionary, has held the seat
in three of the last four elections. He is contesting it this time and is
thought likely to win.
Muzaffarpur - part of the fertile region between the Himalayas and the
Ganges - is also a stronghold of the Bhumihar caste, who claim to have the
same status as Brahmins. They account for 25 per cent of the population.
Yadavs, the most militant of the backward castes, are the next largest
community - thus sharpening the rivalry between the two.
For the first time since independence, however, Mr Singh's success in making
job reservation the central issue here means voting is expected to be
polarised on caste lines. Upper castes are backing the Congress and the
backward castes the Janata Dal.
Previous elections have been characterised by considerable voting across
caste lines, with many Bhumihars supporting the Janata Dal party and
lower-caste groups the Congress.
Growing caste tensions have been accompanied by rising violence. Rioting by
upper-caste youths against job reservation did more damage in Muzaffarpur
than in any other city in Bihar. Unemployment is so high in Bihar that only
20 per cent of graduates find jobs.
Backward castes also appear to have been indulging in the killing of
upper-caste boys. Dr Thakur cites seven recent cases of Bhumihars being
stopped on country roads and shot after revealing their caste.
The hope of the upper castes is that a Congress government in Delhi would
overthrow the Bihar state government and slow the pace of reservation. The
Yadavs and backward castes look to a Janata Dal victory to accelerate what
they call 'social justice'.
They do not seem to be much concerned at the damage which growing caste
conflict is inflicting on the state's economy or its education system.
'Nobody is thinking about that. Nobody bothers,' says Professor Arun Kumar
Sinha, a local Janata Dal leader. 'We are deep in a social struggle.'

<TEXT>
THE GERMAN government yesterday stepped up a campaign for foreign companies
to invest in east Germany as latest figures showed a further rise in
unemployment east of the Elbe to 837,000, 9.5 per cent of the labour force.
The jobless statistics for April, from the Federal Labour Office, underlined
continuing economic divergence between east and west Germany. Unemployment
in the west fell 79,000 during the month to 1.65m, 5.5 per cent of the
labour force, whereas in the former Communist part of the country it rose by
a further 30,000.
Mr Heinrich Franke, president of the Federal Labour Office, warned against
reading too much optimism into the relatively minor rise in the east German
jobless rate last month. A large number of redundancies were planned after
June 30 as east German companies moved to a new system for maintaining
employees on short-time working, he said.
In a speech in Washington yesterday, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the German
economics minister, linked the economic collapse in east Germany above all
to harsh international competition after the introduction of the D-Mark last
July.
He issued an appeal to US investors to participate in rebuilding east
Germany. Terming the restructuring process under way there 'the supershow of
the market economy,' Mr Mollemann said: 'This is an invitation to the whole
world.'
Making his debut before an US audience after taking over as economics
minister in January, Mr Mollemann said the booming west German economy had
become 'the locomotive for its trading partners.'
Highlighting the economic buoyancy in west Germany, unemployment in the west
of the country fell by 262,000 against April 1990, and now stands at the
lowest for 10 years. Reflecting the large increase in labour market
participation over the past 12 months, employment in west Germany rose by
680,000 since April 1990 to 28.8m.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Fractious partners put Andreotti's political skills to test:
The Italian government's stability has been undermined barely a month after
taking office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S 50th post-war government is badly frayed at the edges just a month
after taking office.
Two key problems are undermining the government's stability: intractable
opposition to plans to cut public spending and a long-running row over
constitutional reform.
The fractious four-party coalition has opted to soldier on until the end of
the current legislature in 1992, rather than call early elections. In doing
so it has lumbered the country with a lame duck government unable to take
pressing political decisions.
The coalition has called a meeting for May 11 and it might be forced to the
polls early unless it can settle its differences.
Last Friday Mr Guido Carli, the veteran Treasury minister pledging to sort
out the country's messy finances, was said to be threatening to resign
following opposition to his proposed spending cuts.
Mr Carli wants to trim the country's huge budget deficit, targeted at
L132,000bn (Pounds 60.4bn) this year. Pension reform and a public-sector pay
curb are designed to help raise the L15,000bn-L16,000bn needed to bring this
year's government spending back into line. But the Socialists and some
Christian Democrats in the government are refusing to accept the cuts,
partly for fear of public unpopularity.
Mr Claudio Martelli, the Socialist deputy premier, said last week the
pension and public-sector pay cuts were not part of the programme agreed by
coalition parties last month. Mr Franco Marini, the former trade union
leader, who is the new Christian Democrat minister of labour, has also
voiced objections.
The dispute comes as no surprise to Mr Giorgio La Malfa, head of the small
Republican party which last month pulled out of the coalition after a clash
with Mr Giulio Andreotti, Italian premier, over ministerial posts.
'We called for early elections on an agreed basis in order to save the next
finance bill from the pressure of the elections ahead,' he explains.
'Otherwise we knew the influence of the polls would just increase the
temptation to raise spending.'
Failure to put Italy's messy finances in order would mean a larger
government deficit, possibly triggering higher interest rates and inflation,
along with the risk of an economic downturn.
With pensions and public-sector pay apparently sacrosanct, a mixed bag of
indirect tax rises and new levies is likely, with structural reform once
again being left until after the polls, if not beyond.
Last month's much-publicised decision by Moody's, the US debt rating agency,
to review Italy's top-notch triple-A borrowing status has heightened party
leaders' awareness of international attention focusing on the nation's
deteriorating finances. Criticism of domestic economic management has also
come from the International Monetary Fund and the Bundesbank.
Half-hearted measures would be unlikely to convince foreign investors, who
play an important role in financing Italy's debt, that the country's
politicians are about to get to grips with the deficit.
Mr Andreotti has remained silent about both the political storm and this
week's renewed outbursts by the president, Mr Francesco Cossiga, over
constitutional reform, the issue which was partly to blame for the collapse
of Mr Andreotti's previous government.
Mr Cossiga wants the government to push through fundamental constitutional
reform, including changes to the electoral system, the election of the
president and differentiation of the roles of the two houses of parliament.
He accepted the cabinet's decision to put off the most important proposals
until after next year's polls but, apparently unable to set the issue aside,
he has aired his views almost daily to the media.
As president, Mr Cossiga's interventions can cause no immediate political
threat to the cabinet, but his comments are embarrassing the government and
have fuelled the crisis.
He has also clashed with the Christian Democrats - his former party. Two of
his most recent targets have been berated for speaking to newspapers that
fail to meet the president's approval.
The president has singled out La Repubblica, Italy's biggest-selling
newspaper, for attack. He describes the paper, owned by Mr Carlo De
Benedetti, as being the mouthpiece for the 'politico-financial lobby' which
he claims has been waging a two-year campaign against him.
With tensions within the coalition rising, and Mr Cossiga firing off in all
directions, Mr Andreotti will need all his skills to smooth over the latest
set of upsets threatening his new government.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Brussels clears state aid for Greek steel company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has taken the exceptional decision to approve state
aid for a programme of investments by a Greek steel company, part of a shoal
of small state aid cases passed by Brussels yesterday.
Investment aid is normally forbidden in the steel sector, because it might
increase capacity in a sector where the aim has been to limit EC production.
However, investment aid targeted on a particular region, and which does not
increase capacity, is allowed.
Greece is the only member state to meet all the conditions applied to such
aid and the Commission estimated that the aid to Halyvourgia Thessalias
would not increase the company's production capacity.
Brussels has also allowed France to renew for a further five years its tax
on the clothing industry, aimed principally at raising money for research
and training. The tax, which has existed since 1986, makes up 35 per cent of
the annual resources of the Committee for Development and Promotion of the
Textile and Clothing Industry, up to a figure of FFr57m (Pounds 5.7m).
Sir Leon Brittan, the responsible commissioner, has also approved the
renewal of a three-year aid programme for the Dutch shipbuilding industry,
which falls under the 1990 shipbuilding directive; aid for research and
development in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany; and German aid for riverside
agricultural areas.
The Commission has waved through three deals in the Italian and German steel
industries: a merger between Stinnes Stahlhandel and Josef Stangl
Eisengrosshandlung und Biegerei; a takeover of Industrie Cantieri
Metallurgici Italiani by Ilva of Italy; and the formation of a joint-venture
vehicle by Klockner Stahl, Agais Stahlhandel and Rautaruukkl of Germany.

STRIKING GROUND staff and cabin crews yesterday forced the cancellation of
168 Iberia flights, most of them to international destinations, in the
opening round of a tough union response to wage restraint policies in
Spain's public sector companies.
Industrial action over the next two weeks is expected to spread to the
national railways, to Telefonica, the telecommunications monopoly, to the
state-controlled shipbuilding and aerospace industries, and to the publicly
owned gas companies which are all currently involved in annual wage
negotiations.
The Iberia strike, the first of four 24-hour stoppages planned at the
national airline this month, followed a management decision to freeze salary
increases this year. The company, which is in the process of buying several
Latin American carriers, including Aerolineas Argentinas, lost Pta22.5bn
(Pounds 123.6m) last year and is likely to make further losses this year.
Elsewhere in the public sector, management is offering salary increases of 5
per cent, nearly one point below the present inflation level, in accordance
with guidelines issued by the Economy Ministry. Unions, spurred by pay
awards exceeding 8 per cent in the private sector, are demanding 9 per cent
increases in the public sector.

<TEXT>
The Soviet parliament yesterday began a final reading of long-awaited
legislation allowing free emigration from the Soviet Union before a vote
scheduled for Sunday, writes Leyla Boulton. The US has made adoption of the
legislation a pre-condition for granting the Soviet Union most-favoured
nation trading status.
But US officials say trade restrictions are unlikely to be lifted until the
law comes into force. The present draft stipulates the law should take
effect only from July 1 1992.
Soviet officials cite the cost of restructuring the passport and emigration
service as a principal reason for the interval between adoption and
implementation. But the delay is also probably a concession to opponents of
the legislation who fear that it will trigger a brain drain.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Brussels pressure over social security: Commission seeks
acceptance of 'guidelines' intended to improve benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday put forward guidelines intended to
harmonise and improve social security benefits throughout the EC.
Brussels officials believe that endorsement of the guidelines by member
states would show stronger commitment to the Community's social aims than
the support given to the Social Charter, adopted in December 1989 with the
sole dissent of the UK.
The guidelines are a 'recommendation' which Brussels wants the Council of
Ministers to adopt. This would have no legal standing, but would, in the
Commission's view, acquire political and moral force if it gains the
required unanimous approval of member states.
Brussels wants a general right to benefits, based on need, to be recognised
all over the EC. Eight member states have some form of guaranteed minimum
income for the poor, such as 'income support' in the UK or Sozialhilfe in
Germany. Italy and Spain have similar but limited regional schemes, but
Greece and Portugal have virtually nothing.
The Commission also wants such benefits to be without a time limit, to be
extended to non-EC nationals resident in the Community, and to be
accompanied by access to health care, housing and training.
Its initiative is an attempt to generate movement in an area where it cannot
get laws through, as part of its emphasis that the 'social dimension' to the
single market programme has not been forgotten.
More practically, it wants to limit the scope for 'social dumping':
companies moving to areas of the EC where social legislation is weakest, or,
once exchange rates are locked by monetary union, countries cutting social
expenditure to boost competitiveness.
The Commission's aim is to be able to monitor the extent to which member
states' social security regimes converge. As part of this, it wants the
Twelve mutually to scrutinise each other's practice, rather as they now
examine each other's macroeconomic performance within the so-called
'multilateral surveillance' sessions of the council of finance ministers.
'The strongest we can expect . . . is to be able to embarrass laggard member
states,' a Commission official said.
Britain, which believes that EC social policy should limit itself to health
and safety regulations and the creation of jobs, 'is unlikely to have
serious difficulties with the recommendation,' British diplomats here said.
It could benefit those EC workers who now fall outside any national safety
net, they said.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Leningrad TV to go independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LENINGRAD said yesterday it was setting up the country's first independent
television company after finalising an agreement to turn its relatively
uncensored TV station into a joint-stock company.
Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of the Soviet Union's second city, said however
that only 3 per cent of the stock would be offered to private investors.
Leningrad city council would be the majority shareholder, with a 59 per cent
stake, while the Soviet broadcasting network would get 33 per cent and 10
per cent would go to the Russian Federation's Information Ministry.
With 70m viewers around the country, Leningrad TV has sought to wriggle free
from the control of Mr Leonid Kravchenko, the Soviet broadcasting chief who
has limited media freedoms in recent months. But it has been equally
reluctant to jump into the embrace of Leningrad city council.
The new deal appears to be the best possible compromise on offer, after
Leningrad TV failed to find alternative sources of capital. Among the
company's most popular shows is the current events programme Fifth Wheel,
which is highly critical of the country's entrenched Communist party
bureaucracy.

FT  08 MAY 91 / Bid to revive satellite sports channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS are being made to revive Eurosport, the satellite television sports
channel that went off the air yesterday.
It collapsed after attempts to find Pounds 60m from new investors failed
before the deadline ran out last Friday. The Eurosport consortium brought
together 17 of Europe's public service broadcasters, including the BBC and
Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International.
In February the European Commission decided that the consortium breached
Community competition rules. As a result it would have been illegal for Mr
Murdoch to continue the News International-Sky Television involvement beyond
May 5.
Apart from putting in finance to take the venture to break-even, potential
new investors TF1, the French television company, and International Events
Management (IEM), a grouping of German companies, would have bought out Mr
Murdoch's 50 per cent stake.
Mr Alan Hart, the Eurosport chairman, said yesterday that there was still a
consortium 'and we will do all we can to keep the concept alive.'
Others blamed Brussels for tipping the balance against survival. At a
meeting with Community officials last week, TFI and IEM were told they were
acceptable Eurosport partners in competition terms. However, it is believed
that the officials raised serious questions about the future of the European
Broadcasting Union.
Its role as purchaser of exclusive broadcasting rights for its members is
being investigated by the Commission. Eurosport had access to those rights
through its partners who were EBU members.
The uncertainty over the EBU meant that neither TF1 nor IEM could complete
the Eurosport deal in the time available. 'They say they want to stimulate
competition. All they've done is kill it,' said one of those involved.
However, the Commission said yesterday that it remained ready to continue
discussions with Eurosport.
The channel began broadcasting in February 1989 and reached more than 25m
homes through satellite dishes and cable television networks.

FT  07 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Computerised sell programs
push Dow lower
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
UNDER the weight of computerised sell programs and dividend-related
technical influences, share prices struggled to gain momentum yesterday,
finishing little changed at the end of an exceptionally quiet day, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.78 at 2,941.64,
having spent all but the last few minutes of trading in negative territory.
The broader-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended slightly lower, down 0.72 at
380.08, while the Nasdaq composite of over the counter stocks closed 0.62
lower at 491.48. Turnover on the New York SE was very light at 129m shares;
the quietest trading day since mid-January. Declining stocks outnumbered
advancing stocks by 818 to 699.
The market lacked strength primarily for two reasons. There were several
sell programs in early trading which knocked a few points off the leading
index, and three big stocks went ex-dividend yesterday, which automatically
led to a downward recalculation of the Dow.
A cloud had already been cast over the market by the President's weekend
heart scare. His rapid return to work helped sentiment recover, but concern
about his long-term health, and doubts about the credibility of the
vice-President, Mr Dan Quayle, as a potential successor to Mr Bush, left the
market feeling nervous and prevented share prices from pulling away from the
early losses.
The three stocks that went ex-dividend yesterday were IBM, which was trading
down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 103 3/8 , Union Carbide, down Dollars  3/8 at
Dollars 18 1/4 , and Bethlehem Steel, down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 14 1/2 .
After months of fierce conflict, the news that NCR had finally succumbed to
AT&amp;T's hostile Dollars 110-a-share all stock bid lifted the computer group's
shares Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 103 3/4 , but left AT&amp;T Dollars  3/8 weaker
at Dollars 37 on turnover of 1.7m shares.
MCI Communications, one of the big national telephone companies, eased
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 27 3/4 after the company said it would no longer
handle the billing for so-called 'adult' 900-number telephone calls.
American Cynamid rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 63 3/8 , a new 52-week high,
after an analyst at Merrill Lynch, the big broking house, increased his 1991
and 1992 earnings estimates for the company in the wake of an analysts
meeting with the medical products manufacturer last Friday.
Elsewhere in the health-products sector, United Healthcare, an
over-the-counter stock, climbed Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 43 7/8 in brisk
trading after posting first quarter net profits of 54 cents a share, up from
28 cents a share a year earlier, and Healthcare Compare advanced Dollars 1
3/4 to Dollars 28 1/4 after it reported that net income more than doubled to
19 cents a share in the first quarter of this year.
Among secondary financial stocks, Midlantic Corp fell Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 8 1/4 after warning that non-performing loans would probably
continue to increase in the months ahead because of the persisting difficult
business conditions throughout the US.
Canada
OPENING lower and trading in a tight range throughout the session, Toronto
share prices recouped early losses. The TSE ended off 3.62 points to close
at 3487.67.
Declining issues beat gainers 292 to 226 and trading volume of 15.016 fell
from Friday's 20.741. Nine of fourteen subgroups lost ground. Mining,
energy, consumer products, industrial products and financial services ended
steady.

FT  07 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses in decline as holidays
subdue trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST BOURSES declined yesterday, as holidays in London and Tokyo kept
trading thin, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was marked down in thin trading in the absence of UK investors.
Domestic investors were also hesitant before Thursday's Ascension Day
holiday. The DAX index lost 7.85 to 1,623.99 while the FAZ index, calculated
at midsession, fell 2.29 to 691.29. Volume slipped to DM3.6bn from DM5.3bn.
BASF, the chemical group, fell DM4.50 to DM250.20 after reporting that its
first-quarter group pretax profit had dipped 25 per cent, slightly more than
expected.
Bucking the trend was Metallgesellschaft, which rose DM3 to DM546 following
news over the weekend that it was involved in a DM1bn project to clean up
and modernise one of the largest and most polluted areas of east Germany.
MILAN saw an early but unsustained leap in Fiat on the back of an article in
an Italian business paper, which quoted company sources as saying that the
dividend would be maintained in 1990. There have been fears that the pay-out
would be cut.
Fiat ordinary shares were officially set L195 higher at L5,446, but fell
back to L5,375 after hours, taking the market with them. The Comit index
lost 0.34 to 585.90 in thin volume estimated at L120bn after Friday's
L145bn.
Dealers said that while the market was getting some support from corporate
groups before various rights issues, nervousness over the political
situation remained. News of a net outflow of L83bn in equity funds in April
after a net inflow of L120bn in March could weigh on share values today,
they added.
Generali was weak, slipping to L36,900 after being officially set at
L37,050, down L550.
PARIS eased as hopes of a cut in interest rates were thwarted. The CAC 40
index ended 3.54 down at 1,828.77, recovering from a day's low of 1,816.58,
and turnover fell to about half Friday's FFr2.1bn.
Michelin continued to attract interest, rising FFr1.65 to FFr97.85 on volume
of 432,050 shares. The stock has gained 16.3 per cent in the six sessions
since some brokers raised their forecasts. The tyremaker told shareholders
that Mr Edouard Michelin, son of the current chairman, would be nominated
next month for the post of associate director.
One of the day's big movers was Immobiliere Phenix, the property company,
which jumped FFr8.90 or 4.7 per cent to FFr198.90.
MADRID was one the few bourses to rise. The general index edged up 0.29 to
278.68, recovering from an early fall, in turnover slightly down on Friday's
Pta12.5bn.
The banking and construction sectors produced most of the interest. Banco
Exterior rose Pta65 to Pta3,580 on the news that it is to be integrated with
other state-controlled banks in a new company, Corporacion Bancaria de
Espana.
A block of 601,200 shares or about 6 per cent of the share capital of
Petromed, a Banesto unit, was traded at Pta7,390 a share, up Pta30.
OSLO also ignored the gloom elsewhere and rose in moderate trading, as
optimism about the economy continued to improve, following cuts in interest
rates in the past couple of months. The all-share index gained 4.77 to
488.83 in turnover of NKr302m.
COPENHAGEN edged higher in quiet trading. The bourse index gained 1.28 to
349.31. Den Danske Bank rose DKr1 to DKr324 in turnover of DKr73m, on
foreign demand following its recent European roadshow.
STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden General index fell 7.5 to 1,042.9 in light
turnover of SKr222m. Ericsson accounted for SKr44m of that, as its free B
shares eased SKr2 to SKr191 before its first-quarter earnings report, due
today.
BRUSSELS slipped at the end of the two-week account on the forward market.
The Bel20 index lost 7.8 to 1,177.27. Petrofina, the oil group, was active;
its shares ended above a day's low of BFr11,375 at BFr11,450, down BFr50.
Yesterday was the last day to trade Petrofina's warrant which expires on May
20; the warrant fell BFr25 to BFr2,775.
AMSTERDAM fell in dull trading. The CBS tendency index ended 0.3 down at the
day's low of 95.1.
HBG and Volker Stevin, the builders, were suspended before an announcement
that HBG would purchase Volker Stevin's dredging business and shed its 60
per cent stake in the latter.
ZURICH declined, with the Credit Suisse index off 5.8 at 545.6. Unigestion
was suspended at the request of its leading shareholder, Swiss Bank, pending
news of a reorganisation.
ISTANBUL slumped 4.9 per cent on fears of further selling. The index fell
189.47 to 3,691.71, down 7.4 per cent since Thursday.
ATHENS was led lower by the banking sector. The general index dropped 49.65
or 4.4 per cent to 1,093.23.
The Eurotrack 100 index was not available owing to the closure of the London
Stock Exchange.

FT  07 MAY 91 / US Money And Credit: Bonds face dual test of sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THE yield on long US government bonds ever going to drop through the 8
per cent barrier during the current economic cycle?
The question is being asked with fresh force following last week's surprise
easing by the Federal Reserve, which cut the discount rate to 5 1/2 and Fed
funds to 5 3/4 .
But while this brought rates cascading down at the short end of the maturity
spectrum, the beneficial effect on the long end was short-lived: by the end
of the week the yield on the 30-year Treasury had risen slightly - from 8.20
to 8.22 after traders were spooked by curious unemployment data.
The yield curve, which charts the difference between short and long-term
interest rates, is now steeper than it has been for years. Two tests of bond
market sentiment will this week underline why: Today, the Treasury starts
its quarterly refunding exercise with a record sale of Dollars 37bn of
securities - Dollars 18.97bn of roll-over funds and Dollars 18.025bn of new
money. Today's tranche is Dollars 13.5bn of three-year notes, Wednesday
brings Dollars 11.75bn of 10-year notes and Thursday Dollars 11.75bn of
30-year bonds.
The heavy volume of Treasury issues is set to continue to the end of the
year - the government says it will need to borrow some Dollars 110bn to
Dollars 115bn in the third quarter - with Wall Street expecting the Federal
budget deficit to total between Dollars 240bn and Dollars 280bn.
Companies' keenness to raise funds ahead of the government's large call for
money has produced a near-record rush of corporate debt issues: nearly
Dollars 6bn is believed to have hit the market last week. The great supply
of government debt helps keep upward yield pressures on the long end - rates
have to be kept attractive to encourage new buyers.
The prospective firming of the dollar may stir additional foreign interest,
but a tentative atmosphere ahead of the auction saw Treasuries little
changed yesterday, with the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond marginally
lower, at 8.212, in late trading.
On Friday, the government will release its latest statistics on inflation -
the April producer price indices - amid continuing bond market concern that
excessive inflationary pressures may remain in the financial system. The PPI
figures are expected to be unremarkable, with most economists expecting a
rise of just 0.1 per cent on the month, or 0.2 per cent in the core rate.
The market's nervousness over the outlook for inflation increased last
Friday when the government announced a drop in the April civilian
unemployment rate - from 6.8 per cent in March to 6.6 per cent. The figures,
showing an unusually big increase in the number of self-employed and
government workers, were dismissed as a possible aberration.
Even so, figures for payroll employment - derived by a different method to
the unemployment tally - did point to a slowing of the nation's economic
decline, with the non-farm total dropping by 124,000 workers, compared with
241,000 in March. Those figures suggested to many economists that the US is
approaching the bottom of the recessionary trough and in turn led some
analysts to question whether the Fed was hasty with last week's easing.
The Fed said its move was taken 'in the light of continuing weakness in
economic activity, especially in the industrial and capital goods areas',
and it also stressed 'evidence of abating inflationary pressures'.
Certainly, a large number of indicators have recently been pointing to a
marked slowdown in inflation, including the National Association of
Purchasing Managers' price index, which has now dropped to its lowest
reading since April 1982.
A sustained cut in the rate of inflation would give the Fed more room to
manoeuvre, should it feel further easing is necessary to kick start the
economy - and the recent indicators have given no clear sign as to the
timing or strength of any recovery.
Wall Street is certainly not expecting any early rate cuts and few are
forecasting anything more than another  1/4 off Fed funds in this interest
rate cycle. Indeed, an economic recovery later in the year would shift
attention to possible Fed tightening and rising yields. So if the long bond
does dip below 8 per cent, it may not go very far for very long.

FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: Decline in BASF profit continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS of BASF, the German chemical group, have continued to decline,
falling 25 per cent to DM632m (Dollars 372m) pre-tax in the first quarter of
1991.
'We do not foresee a rapid recovery of our markets - or a dramatic
deterioration,' said Mr Jurgen Strube, chief executive. Business in the US
had not improved after the Gulf war, though an upswing could occur if demand
for cars and houses improved in line with higher consumer confidence.
BASF is the first of the big German chemical groups to report on progress so
far this year. Bayer reports today.
Mr Strube also cited currency shifts and depressed selling prices, business
difficulties in Brazil and Argentina and weaker trends in some western
European regions such as Scandinavia. Higher sales volumes in Germany and
important European markets had not been enough to compensate for the
problems in North and South America.
Noting the downturn in business had started in the third quarter of 1990, Mr
Strube said forecasts for 1991 could not be based on the first quarter,
which was strong last year. For the rest of 1991, 'I expect we can sharply
reduce the gap with the previous year seen at the end of the first quarter'.
He would not be drawn on whether profits would be down on the reduced 1990
result, similar to that of 1987. 'Matching the 1990 and 1987 earnings this
year will take a considerable effort - and more than just a dash of luck'.
The first quarter decline occurred on turnover 3.5 per cent lower at
DM11.5bn. Domestic sales rose 2 per cent, but those abroad were down by 10
per cent due to currency movements. In the US, turnover was down 10 per cent
in dollars and 18 per cent in D-Marks. Last year, total pre-tax profits were
37 per cent lower at DM2.7bn, with net income down by 45 per cent to
DM1.1bn. Cash flow, however, was only 9 per cent lower at DM5bn. Earnings
per share were DM24 (DM38).
Mr Strube said BASF expected the dollar to stabilise at DM1.60 rather than
at the current level, just over DM1.70. A rapid drop below DM1.50 was
unlikely. Last year's dollar weakness had a downward impact of DM1.3bn on
sales.

Activity in the Asia-Pacific region was a feature of last week's
international mergers and acquisitions, writes Brian Bollen.
The sale of Australian merchant bank Dominguez Barry Samuel Montagu
continues Midland Bank's strategy of selling non-core assets outside Europe
and enables purchaser Swiss Bank Corp to expand its international investment
banking business.
Morgan Grenfell furthered its ambition to establish a strong independent
presence in the south east Asian securities market, taking a 30 per cent
stake in Malaysian stockbroker K&amp;N Kenanga.
Laporte of the UK is expanding its business in printed wiring board
chemicals into a fast growing market for electronics, through the
acquisition of Taipei-based Taiwan Spechem.
Elsewhere, the tender offer by South African-controlled Oceana for a stake
in UK fashion retailer Etam confirms the suspicions of some market players
that the UK retailing sector has bottomed out. While Oceana said it is
considering an offer for the whole company and is using the tender to gauge
shareholder response, Etam attacked it as an attempt to gain back door
control at an unacceptably low price.
In the ongoing restructuring of the global car industry, Japan's car
assembly presence will increase when Mitsubishi Motors completes its
purchase of one third of Volvo Cars, joining the Dutch government and Volvo
as an equal partner.
The horticultural division of UK group Fisons is making its first
significant move into continental Europe with the purchase of DSM Agro
Specialties of Holland.

FT  07 MAY 91 / BIL selling 30% stake in Mount Charlotte
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRIERLEY Investments (BIL), the New Zealand investment group, is selling 30
per cent of Mount Charlotte Investments, Britain's second largest hotel
chain, for Pounds 227.5m.
BIL took control of Mount Charlotte last year following a takeover bid for
the 14,000-room hotel chain. It is selling the 30 per cent stake to two
Singapore government agencies responsible for foreign investment.
The two groups, Temasek Holding and Government of Singapore Investment, will
also subscribe to new BIL shares, providing the New Zealand group with about
NZDollars 126m of additional funds.
BIL chief executive Mr Paul Collins said the links were with 'canny'
Singaporean investors planning a long-term relationship which would help
correct BIL's debt position.
BIL is selling the Mount Charlotte shares at 85p each compared with last
year's takeover price of 73p. Its new share issue represents around 4.7 per
cent of the company.
Mr Collins said a group of 10 Singaporean investors had toured the UK
assessing the merits of each hotel. He said that BIL might eventually
dispose of a further 20 per cent of Mount Charlotte.
Talks had not been held on selling further Mount Charlotte shares to the
Singaporeans, although the Mount Charlotte management was delighted with
their involvement.
The Singaporeans planned to increase their shareholding in BIL to 10 per
cent, as market conditions permitted. A Singaporean representative would be
appointed to the BIL board.

FT  07 MAY 91 / NCR agrees Dollars 7.4bn bid from AT&amp;T
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NCR, the Ohio-based computer company, has finally agreed to an all-paper bid
valued at around Dollars 7.4bn (Pounds 4.4bn) from American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, the US telecommunications group.
This ends a struggle which began last December, when AT&amp;T offered Dollars
90-a-share in cash, but encountered strong opposition from NCR. More
recently, there have been signs that NCR had come to view a deal as
inevitable, and the two sides have been edging towards terms acceptable to
both of them.
In late April, AT&amp;T suggested it might go up to Dollars 110 per NCR share -
as NCR had demanded - but wanted to replace the cash consideration by paper.
That led to haggling over protection for NCR investors against any fall in
AT&amp;T's share price.
The merger agreement signed by the two sides offers slightly more protection
to NCR shareholders than the improved bid proposal from AT&amp;T last month.
Under yesterday's agreement, the number of AT&amp;T shares received for each NCR
share will be determined by dividing Dollars 110 by the average closing
price for AT&amp;T during a 20-day period ahead of an NCR shareholder meeting to
vote on the deal.
However, NCR shareholders will not receive more than 3.223 AT&amp;T shares for
each NCR share, or less than 2.708 shares.
Part of AT&amp;T's strategy in pursuing NCR has centred on the prospect of
merging its own, unsuccessful computer business into NCR and leaving the
Ohio company to manage the combined business.
Yesterday, however, AT&amp;T said that Mr Charles Exley, NCR's chief executive
who led the opposition to the bid, would retire when the merger is completed
 -somewhat earlier than expected - although he will head a 'transition
team', studying how the business should be combined. It will be four or five
months before the merger is finally effected, and Mr Exley will remain as a
consultant after leaving NCR.
Mr Robert Allen, AT&amp;T's chairman said he had accepted Mr Exley's proposals
for the succession at NCR. Mr Gilbert Williamson, currently NCR's president,
will take over from Mr Exley, and will also become an AT&amp;T director and a
member of its management executive committee. Mr Elton White, at present NCR
executive vice-president, will become president of NCR.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Struggling to hold the back door closed: The UK's attempts
to control acquisitions by foreign state-controlled companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The clearance last week of Elf Aquitaine's Pounds 300m acquisition of Amoco,
the UK petrol-station and refinery business, has thrown the whole future of
the British government's tough stance on acquisitions by foreign
state-controlled companies into doubt.
For the fourth time since Mr Peter Lilley, the Trade and Industry Secretary,
announced last July that in future he would scrutinise all acquisitions by
foreign state-controlled companies, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
has left him powerless to act.
If the aim of the policy was to prevent 'nationalisation by the back door',
it appears to have failed. At the very least it now seems unnecessary. Can
it survive this latest blow?
At the back of Mr Lilley's policy lies the government's conviction that
private ownership leads to the more efficient allocation of resources - the
same economic policy stance which lies behind its commitment to
privatisation.
Viewed from abroad, however, it is easy to see how this new policy might
appear protectionist and contrary to the underlying principles of the single
market.
The French, in particular, appear to believe it is a protectionist policy
directed specifically at them. Four of the five references to the commission
made since the new policy was introduced have involved French
state-controlled companies.
Three of them - Woodchester/Credit Lyonnais, Sligos( owned by Credit
Lyonnais)/Signet and Elf Aquitaine/Amoco - were referred by Mr Lilley
against the advice of the Director General of Fair Trading.
In only one case, Kemira Oy/ICI, has the commission concluded that the
merger might be expected to operate against the public interest.
Credit Lyonnais, incensed by what it sees as a deliberate discriminatory
policy, has lodged a complaint with the European Commission in Brussels.
In defence of the British position it was almost inevitable that the French
would fall foul of the new policy more often than other European states.
Since early 1989 French state-controlled companies have made many more
cross-border mergers and acquisitions throughout Europe than nationalised
groups from any other European country.
They were particularly active during the first quarter of 1990 making 40
European deals with a disclosed value of Ecu 2.52bn (Pounds 1.4bn) - 58 per
cent of the value of all French deals in Europe. Britain has proved the most
popular target for French state-controlled industry.
Indeed, Mr John Redwood, Corporate Affairs Minister, first referred to the
government's intention to adopt the policy announced officially by Mr Lilley
in July after the announcement in March last year of a Pounds 301m bid by
Orkem, the French state-controlled chemicals group for Coates Brothers, the
UK inks and resins manufacturer.
The French may also have fallen foul of the Lilley policy because of their
fundamentally different attitude to public-sector enterprises. They do not
hold with the British view that private ownership necessarily leads to the
more efficient allocation of resources. It all depends on how state control
is exercised.
During the early stages of the investigation by the MMC of the Credit
Lyonnais/ Woodchester acquisition, the first of the five to be referred
following the policy statement at the end of July, the DTI took pains to
explain to the commission the reasons why Mr Lilley regards state ownership
as raising public-interest issues which may merit investigation.
A letter was sent from the DTI to the MMC outlining the reasons behind the
policy. DTI officials attended hearings at the commission and made written
submissions. The DTI letter makes it clear that the new merger reference
policy rests on the proposition that state-controlled companies are always
likely to behave in fundamentally different ways in the market place than
privately owned ones because the state as shareholder is unlike private
enterprise shareholders.
The Government believes state control represents an extreme degree of
immunity from market forces. The state may have objectives distinct from
normal commercial objectives of maximising the financial return on a
shareholder's investment. State-controlled companies do not face the threat
of financial failure.
The DTI maintains that, because their objectives may or may not be seen as
strictly commercial their behaviour is unpredictable, creating uncertainty
in the market. Competitive forces are weakened and some misallocation of
resources and overall loss of efficiency may result.
In the case of acquisitions by foreign state-controlled companies, the DTI
also fears that the state concerned might be trying to gain control of a
certain sector of the market in order to influence it in some way which
could be damaging to UK interests. Furthermore the market for corporate
control will be adversely affected because state-controlled companies
themselves are generally immune from takeover and takeover pressures.
The French approach is made clear by evidence to the MMC by its Ecomomics
and Finance Ministry. The basic thrust is that there is a broad consensus in
France on two fundamental principles which must be applied to public sector
enterprises: that they should have management autonomy and that fair and
open competition between public enterprises and between public and private
enterprises must be guaranteed in France and within the European Community.
The French government likens itself to any other majority shareholder.
French company law provides a strict framework for the government's
responsibilities. The government refrains from interfering in management
decisions although it reserves the right to pass judgment on the results of
the strategy adopted (this, it says, is no different from any majority
shareholder in a private company).
Public enterprises have no special access to special funding for
acquisitions. They decide for themselves on their commercial and financial
objectives which are approved by the government as far as they affect its
interests as shareholder. Public industrial enterprises are free to choose
their insurers and bankers. The government ensures competition law is
strictly applied.
The British response to this is that it is all fine in theory but the
reality may be different. However, on four occasions the MMC has accepted on
the evidence before it the French explanation of the role played by its
government in the management of French public enterprises.
Its conclusions on the issue of state-control in the Elf case largely echo
those in the other three French cases - the French government leaves the
running of its state enterprises to their managements.
So is Mr Lilley's policy now a dead letter? Clearly there are occasions
where state-control can be a factor which requires investigating during the
normal course of an MMC inquiry into a proposed merger which raises
competition concerns. But in the absence of sound reasons for referring a
proposed merger on competition grounds, state-control is surely no longer a
good enough reason on its own for launching a full-scale MMC inquiry.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Bangladesh rocked by fresh gales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FRESH GALES were yesterday causing further destruction along the coast of
Bangladesh, where nearly 10m people made homeless by last week's cyclone
still await relief from hunger, thirst and disease.
The death toll continues to mount and some officials say as many as 500,000
people may have died. A lack of communications and bad weather have hampered
the relief effort and delayed an accurate assessment of the disaster.
Bangladesh's entire armed forces, police and home guard have been mobilised
for the effort, but their resources are woefully inadequate.
Local relief is supplemented by a trickle of help from abroad. Helicopters,
including three given by India, two by Pakistan and six from Bangladesh
itself, are dropping supplies for the survivors.
Aid amounting to Dollars 130m (Pounds 76.7m) has been promised by the US,
the European Community, Japan, Canada and Saudi Arabia.
There are hurdles in the way of the immediate relief work and future
recovery. Having just emerged from a period of political turmoil, the
country is struggling to tackle yet another natural calamity.
Bangladesh's inexperienced leadership and inefficient bureaucracy is
ill-equipped to tackle a human tragedy of frightening dimensions.
Foreign relief agencies in the capital Dhaka point out that the country
lacks the capacity to absorb large-scale aid and say that international
agencies will have to become involved in the relief work.
The only supplies reaching survivors are by air. Means of communication
barely exist and much of the country's infrastructure has been lost. All
roads and bridges have been destroyed.
The damage to the infrastructure and to crops and livestock could exceed the
present estimate of Dollars 1bn, a crippling burden on an economy with a
population growing at about 2.5 per cent annually, but with only a 3.5 per
cent growth in gross national product last year.
More than 200,000 square miles of the country were inundated. There is
virtually no livestock left. The country's winter crop, much of it ready for
harvesting, has been destroyed. Last year's food grain production of 10.9m
tonnes will fall sharply in 1991-92 and further imports will be needed.
Coastal embankments built as part of flood-protection schemes have been
destroyed, as well as irrigation projects, rural water supply and
electricity stations.
The economy will be particularly badly hit by the damage to the 70 foreign
exchange-earning units in the export-processing zone at Chittagong. Tidal
waves have virtually washed away their stocks and machines.
Bangladesh's lucrative shrimp industry at the port of Cox's Bazar has been
wiped out. It too will take time and money to rebuild. In Chittagong port,
sunken vessels clog up the main channel and quays, halting all trade.
A reluctance by foreign investors to put money into a cyclone-prone area is
likely to hamper rebuilding efforts.
Foreign exchange reserves have been partly shored up by the first tranche of
a loan from the International Monetary Fund and are at a fairly comfortable
Dollars 600m, worth about two months of imports. Thousands of Bangladeshis
are returning to work in the Gulf and their remittances will add to the
reserves, but they will be quickly depleted.
Bangladesh already had enough economic troubles before the cyclone.
Inflation, which reached 10 per cent last year, will be pushed higher by the
scarcity of resources. Private investment, both internal and foreign, was
already being held back until the new political leadership, in place for two
months, clarifies its policies.
For the present, long-term measures are taking second place to the immediate
crisis.

THE South African govern-ment appears ready to restore land to some of the
3.5m blacks forcibly removed under apartheid, reversing an earlier decision
to reject all claims for restoration.
In an interview in today's Financial Times survey of South Africa, President
F. W. de Klerk makes clear that his government is willing to moderate its
tough line on the land issue, which has been criticised by anti-apartheid
groups and foreign governments. This appears to be part of the government's
attempt to create a climate conducive to constitutional negotiations at a
time of rising political tensions.
The African National Congress has said it will boycott talks unless the
government takes steps by Thursday to end violence which has left more than
150 people dead in the past week.
Relations between the ANC and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom
Party further deteriorated during the weekend amid further killings - six
people died in a bus ambush in Tembisa township, north of Johannesburg
yesterday - and an Inkatha threat, later denied by Chief Buthelezi, to
deploy 250,000 armed warriors in black townships around Johannesburg.
Mr de Klerk's policy shift follows the publication in March of a white paper
which said that it 'would not be feasible' to restore land to victims of
forced removals. The victims referred to are families evicted from their
homes during the past 30 years as part of Pretoria's policy of confining all
blacks to separate homelands.
In the interview, which was conducted three weeks ago but was under embargo
until today, Mr de Klerk stresses that the government is 'not . . .
unapproachable' on the issue of restitution. 'Government's general approach
to this issue is to address the cases concerned with sympathy and
reasonableness.'
It is understood that the government has agreed to set up a land commission
to advise on claims resulting from apartheid removals. It is also understood
that some of the legislation tabled as part of a land reform package will be
withdrawn for further discussion.
The government will go ahead, however, with a bill abolishing the Group
Areas Act, which imposes residential segregation, and the 1913 and 1936 Land
Acts, which prevented blacks from owning more than 13 per cent of South
Africa.

FT  07 MAY 91 / How to make a bad job worse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the local elections, the government has been stuck with a Micawber
strategy; but if you are waiting for something to turn up, you should at
least ensure that nothing you do will impede it. The news on the public
spending front suggests that they have not taken this simple precaution.
The Thatcher government started its term with two economic strategies: a
medium-term financial strategy, which was meant to provide a stable policy
background, and a system of cash budgeting, which was designed to enlist the
public sector in the fight against rising costs. These rules were meant to
make government policy predictable and stabilising. In the event, they were
badly designed and had the opposite effect.
The medium-term strategy was framed in terms of the broad money supply,
which proved uncontrollable, as it was bound to do. It blew a fuse. The cash
rules were increasingly applied not to control budgeted spending, which
would have been sensible, but to borrowing. This is a destabilising rule. In
the US, it applies to most state spending, because the US has
balanced-budget laws. The result is that it is imposing an additional
squeeze of about Dollars 50bn on an already depressed economy, since it has
to cut spending as revenue falls; one reason why the promised economic
recovery keeps getting later.
Now the Treasury seems to be applying the same handbag economics to the UK
national budget; spending must be cut because revenue is weak. This is
likely to have the same result as in the US, in spite of the fact that the
chancellor explained in his Budget speech that a rise in borrowing at a time
of recession is not only to be expected but to be welcomed; it is an
automatic stabiliser. Not if you switch it off, it isn't.
There are three possible explanations for this, all of them bad. It could be
just a recurrence of bad habits; Mrs Thatcher's intense distaste for public
borrowing, even for productive investment, never did make sense. It could be
nostalgia for 1981, when tight fiscal policy at a time of recession heralded
a recovery, in defiance of 364 Keynesian economists. But the 1981 budget
worked because under the market conditions of the time, it weakened a
grossly overvalued pound. Now it is a prime objective of policy to keep the
pound too strong for comfort, to the horror of six monetarist economists; so
a tight budget cannot produce an external stimulus.
Most probably, though, ministers are scared of a bad reception in the gilts
market - a return of rule by the young men who write brokers' circulars, as
Mr Denis Healey complained. They seem to be younger than ever now; some of
the comments are evidently written by analysts who have no experience of any
government borrowing at all, so they find all large numbers frightening. In
fact, though, it is remarkably easy to borrow large sums in a recession, as
the US Treasury has found, to its surprise and delight. A world financial
market which can cheerfully accommodate some Dollars 300bn of US borrowing -
a genuinely frightening figure - is hardly likely to choke over the odd
Pounds 5bn of extra UK borrowing.
It is time to revive a medium-term strategy within the meaning of Mr
Lamont's speech - a plan for public spending designed to rise in line with
the expected trend growth of the economy (or preferably a bit slower). Once
he has such a plan, the chancellor should stick to it.
He would rightly be condemned if he embarked on a spending spree just
because the private sector was unexpectedly strong - that was how President
Reagan got the US economy into chronic debt; but he should be just as firm
in ignoring unexpected weakness and the market should understand this.
Otherwise, public policy is prey to every shifting mood in the private
sector, which is not a strategy of any kind.
Meanwhile, the Department of Trade and Industry is going in for its own kind
of destabilisation. In pursuit of market transparency, it is showing an
unhealthy interest in what goes on at brokers' corporate lunches. Again, the
reasons sound sensible: the officials are afraid that brokers may get an
inside tip about profit trends from the ho-hums and eyebrow-waggling which
take the place of any hard information at these meals (a form of
communication first perfected by the Bank of England).
The DTI therefore urges boards to make a general profits announcement before
they go out to lunch. However, companies can hardly issue revised forecasts
every day, so the actual result is likely to be the same as that of the
insider trading law it is meant to support - to keep honest men in
ignorance. The sensible answer would be to repeal the insider trading law,
since it is virtually unenforceable and gives innocent investors a false
impression. This will not happen, though; it would offend the fashionable
cult of the small investor.
The City must seek some other remedy for the real damage the law does: it
deprives the institutions, who control most of the shares, of the
information they need to act as responsible shareholders. The good news is
that some sensible ideas are beginning to emerge, though they have taken a
long time to surface.
Some insurance companies, and one or two issuing houses - notably BZW - are
trying to devise a new form of intermediary; a committee which would
represent big shareholders, but would not itself hold or trade in shares.
Such a committee could demand management information without offending the
law, and could be given the clout, by way of proxy votes, to get it.
It could then insist that problem companies call in consultants to address
particular problems; and logically, it could also demand the appointment of
new directors, as we are already seeing at Granada. This would,
incidentally, remove one main cause of the 'illogical' take-over bids on
which the Select Committee on Trade and Industry will no doubt be
pronouncing soon.
The only trouble is that the DTI may soon get suspicious about these
activities, and strangle the infant committees in red tape. One government
department throwing out the baby with the bath water is more than enough.

<TEXT>
FRENCH president Francois Mitterrand and Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet
leader, yesterday threw their joint weight behind creation of a Palestinian
state and proposals for a Middle East peace conference.
After talks with Mr Mitterrand, who was in Moscow on a one-day visit,
President Gorbachev said that failure to resolve the Middle East conflict
swiftly could 'once again spill over into difficult, acute situations' such
as the Gulf war.
At the same time, the Soviet Union confirmed that foreign minister Mr
Alexander Bessmertnykh would visit Israel this week - the first head of
Soviet international diplomacy to visit the Jewish state since Moscow
severed diplomatic ties in 1967.
Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, is also to return to the Middle
East later this week. Mr Baker said he intended to meet Mr Bessmertnykh, 'so
that we can continue to try to co-ordinate our efforts to promote a peace
conference jointly sponsored by the US and the Soviet Union'.
The US is seeking to promote both face-to-face negotiations between Israel
and each of its Arab neighbours and direct discussions between Israel and
Palestinian representatives. Mr Baker said this would be 'a very broad
conference of a nature and type that has never before taken place'.
The Soviet foreign minister, on a four-day tour starting tomorrow, will
visit Jordan, Egypt and possibly Lebanon. A foreign ministry spokesman said
Mr Bessmertnykh hoped to meet Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organisation.
Israel, while willing to talk to Arab states directly, has opposed an
international conference or any discussions involving the PLO. Saudi Arabia
and other Gulf states are unwilling to participate in the initial stages of
any conference, while Syria has said it would only join talks sponsored by
the United Nations.
In Moscow Mr Mitterrand said he would campaign in his own country and the
international community for as much assistance as possible to 'help
President Gorbachev and perestroika'.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Economists foresee autumn poll: FT survey suggests declining
prospects for government next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC conditions could box the government into an October general
election, after the Tories' performance in last week's local government
elections in effect ruled out a snap June poll, economists warn today.
Next month the economy will be still stuck in recession with annual
inflation running at about 6 per cent. Although it will fall to about 4 per
cent by the end of this year, by early 1992 it will have started to climb
again, the economists predict. Interest rates will have stopped falling and
the trade gap begun to widen, they add.
With unemployment expected to average 2.6m next year and set to continue
rising well into 1993, the Tories are likely to preside over an increase in
public borrowing to at least Pounds 12.2bn next year from a forecast Pounds
8.8bn in the 1991-92 financial year.
If the government wants to avoid going to the polls against either of these
poor economic backcloths, it will have to capitalise on the low interest
rates and inflation likely in October.
These conclusions emerge from today's Financial Times spring survey of
economic forecasts from 21 leading academic economists, City institutions
and private-sector financial groups.
It discloses increasing anxiety about the strength of the recovery which Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has said is 'round the corner'.
Over the weekend, the Institute of Directors and the 3i investment capital
group reported a significant rise in business optimism over the past two
months. The independent forecasters, however, are convinced that the
recovery will be much less rapid than the descent into recession last year,
and fragile and weak at best when it starts around the third quarter of this
year.
The consensus among the 21 forecasters suggests a turnaround in gross
domestic product from a 1.6 per cent drop this year to growth of around 2
per cent next year. But this will be insufficient to stem sharp rises in
unemployment. Manufacturing output is projected to fall by 4.6 per cent this
year and the current account deficit to grow from Pounds 6.3bn in 1991 to
Pounds 7.3bn next year.
Recent interest rate cuts will not be as effective as in previous
recessions, because companies will use cheaper borrowing to repair balance
sheets rather than invest in new plant, machinery or labour.
Economists fear that the recovery will not be sustained. Worries centre on
the government's reliance on growth in real incomes and consumer spending to
pull the economy out of recession, rather than structural improvements to
manufacturing industry.
Rising demand pressures - and technical factors associated with the
compilation of the retail prices index - are predicted to cause inflation to
rise to 4.3 per cent by the end of next year, after falling to 3.6 per cent
this autumn.
Some economists fear for sterling's stability in the wake of the local
government elections. The political uncertainty will mount, 'weakening
sterling and hence limiting the authorities' ability to cut base rates and
even, conceivably, forcing them to increase rates', warns Mr Roger Bootle,
of Greenwell Montagu.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Stopping the rot at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LIVING with the past is an uncomfortable business for Lloyd's of London.
Just as the big private insurance market confronts a dramatic collapse in
profitability, the press headlines continue to reflect regulatory failures
that pre-date the 1982 Lloyd's Act but which are only now surfacing in the
courts.
Memories of the 19th century-style buccaneering business ethic that once
prevailed at Lloyd's thus die hard. And the decline in underwriting
profitability now threatens many of those who back the market with their
private resources - the so-called Names - with a positively Dickensian fall
from grace. Because membership of Lloyd's entails unlimited liability,
several thousand are said to face personal bankruptcy.
Just to compound the problem, an institution which used to be pretty much a
law unto itself seems today to be fair game for the lawyers. Those Names who
face financial ruin are naturally tempted to demand compensation from
Lloyd's itself for alleged supervisory failings. The record at Lloyd's is
not one that commands much sympathy. But it has to be acknowledged that
finding an escape route from this painful time-warp would be a formidable
task for any management that found itself in charge of a troubled City club
whose pedigree goes back more than 300 years.
Regulatory problems
The regulatory problems of Lloyd's, though far from insignificant, are no
longer as pressing a problem as the commercial threat. Lloyd's is generally
expected to record an overall loss for 1988 - the latest year in its
three-year accounting system - of Pounds 150m. Some expect the loss to rise
to Pounds 1bn in 1989 and for 1990 to be another poor year. In part, that
reflects a run of catastrophes, such as the Piper Alpha disaster, the Exxon
Valdez pollution saga and a high incidence of hurricanes; in part, the
continuing horror story in US liability insurance. The problem has been
further compounded by the weakness of the dollar, which affects a high
proportion of premium income at Lloyd's, and by competition.
The balance of risk and reward in the market has, then, been singularly
unfavourable over the past decade for the Names, which will be reflected
shortly in the first overall loss at Lloyd's since 1967. That earlier
collapse in underwriting profitability precipitated the Cromer report, whose
unpublished recommendations included both regulatory reform and the
introduction of more outside capital.
Non-professional influx
Yet ironically, it was the introduction of increasing numbers of
non-professionals into the market that paved the way for many of the
malpractices of the 1970s, in which the professionals preyed on the
non-professionals within a self-regulatory framework. And by permitting an
erosion in the level of real personal wealth that outside individuals were
required to show in order to become Names, the ruling council of Lloyd's
ended up addressing a capital shortage by bringing in people with inadequate
capital to absorb the losses that are now emerging.
To its credit, Lloyd's has now raised the entry threshold from Pounds
100,000 to Pounds 250,000. It should raise it further. The council has also
responded to recent criticism arising from heavy losses at Feltrim and other
agencies with proposals to review circumstances surrounding large losses,
conciliation and arbitration procedures to keep disputes out of court and a
rule requiring disclosure of underwriters' salaries, which are often bloated
in relation to underlying profitability.
This, too, is welcome as far as it goes. But a more direct attack on the
problems of unlimited liability and the recent difficulty that Names have
experienced in obtaining stop-loss policies to cap their liability is called
for. That is the job of a high-powered task force that is now said to be
thinking the unthinkable on this and other contentious issues at Lloyd's. It
will need to take a radically disrespectful view of the past if the
institution is not to become a residual sink for the worst risks in the
global insurance system, thereby incurring further irremediable damage to
its competitive edge.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Leading Article: The Quayle factor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is nothing like a president confined to a hospital to quicken the
pulse of US politics. Mr George Bush's release from one yesterday with
apparently the full confidence of his doctors ought to set to rest all the
obvious questions about the succession, but in practice it will not.
Suddenly there is renewed interest in next year's presidential election
campaign. What had appeared a mundane event, with the incumbent's return a
near certainty, has been rendered full of intrigue, for both parties.
The reason for this is Dan Quayle, the vice-president, to whom is attached
no sense of political invincibility or governmental desirability. The
prospect of running against Mr Quayle, as the man who might take over from
Mr Bush, is far more enticing than going against Mr Bush alone. Any doubt
about the president's health makes the vice-president, if still running
mate, an issue in a campaign.
Mr Quayle was a cynical political choice in 1988 and, thankless as the
vice-president's job often is, he has done little since to convince that he
is qualified to serve as chief executive in his own right. Some
vice-presidents have so graduated. Gerald Ford, much helped by an able
cabinet, did so after the Nixon resignation in 1974, while Harry Truman and
Lyndon Johnson went on to some great things, including winning elections on
their own. But Mr Quayle, on all available evidence, has nothing like their
experience or intrinsic qualities.
Widespread assumption
Mr Bush has not stated unequivocally that he intends to keep Mr Quayle on
the ticket in 1992, though it was the widespread assumption in Washington
that he would. With Mr Bush healthy, this would not have mattered too much,
since other Republican contenders would still have had plenty of time to
position themselves for the race to usurp Mr Quayle as heir apparent four
years later.
Mr Bush, it is to be hoped, will serve out two full terms, as did President
Eisenhower in spite of severe heart trouble and President Reagan after being
shot early in his presidency. But this latest reminder of mortality for a
man who pushes himself very hard means that the question of who stands the
proverbial heartbeat away takes on new importance. Presumably men like James
Baker, the secretary of state, Dick Cheney, the secretary of defence, and
perhaps even, if he is indeed a Republican, General Colin Powell, of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, will be engaging in quiet recalculation.
Enfeebled Democrats
The Democrats, on the other hand, have less need for discretion. After the
disaster of the Dukakis campaign and some underwhelming House and Senate
performances last year, they have appeared quite leaderless, even further
enfeebled by their opposition to the Gulf war. Normally, at this stage in
the political cycle, candidates have already begun to proclaim themselves
but so far only the quixotic - George McGovern and Paul Tsongas from the
party's left, old and new - have actively explored running. Not for the
first time, Governor Mario Cuomo of New York has started behaving like one,
though with plenty of room for withdrawal.
The conventional wisdom was that the only reason to run next year against Mr
Bush would be to put down a marker for four years later. But this itself is
a high-risk and expensive proposition, not lightly to be undertaken. The
landslide defeats suffered by Mr McGovern in 1972 and Mr Walter Mondale in
1984 were not long-term investments in the future.
But Mr Quayle is a different proposition from Mr Bush, as is undoubtedly
under discussion this week in Cleveland where the Democratic Leadership
Conference, representing the party's middle-of-the-roaders, is holding one
of its regular get-togethers.
Mr Quayle may wrap himself in the flag and the Gulf, but his power base is
essentially on the Republican right, which has been in progressive eclipse
with the passing of the Reagan era. Mr Bush, after the war and perhaps
before it, was a difficult target. Mr Quayle, relatively, is a sitting duck.

SUBSTANTIAL losses at the Feltrim underwriting agencies will be the first to
be investigated under a procedure instigated last week by Lloyd's of London,
the insurance mar-ket.
Measures announced last week included the launch of an inquiry whenever a
syndicate's net loss at the end of a three-year accounting period amounts to
150 per cent or more of the amount of premium a syndicate is allowed to
write.
Published figures for losses at Feltrim exceed this ratio, Lloyd's said, but
exact figures for the losses have yet to be established. A meeting of
Feltrim Names - outsiders who back Lloyd's with their personal wealth - is
set for tomorrow.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Ban urged on mortgage service tie-in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAW Society has called on the government to impose a market-wide ban on
the tying-in of financial services to residential property loans, writes
Robert Rice.
The society says a ban would promote competition between financial
institutions, which from next year will be able to provide conveyancing
services to their borrowers, and protect consumers by offering them a choice
in selecting the services needed to buy or sell a house.
The government proposes, under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, to
allow the tying-in of services provided consumers are given written
cautions.
The society says this 'half-hearted approach' gives consumers no clear
rights to buy mortgage, insurance, estate agency and conveyancing services
from separate providers at separately identified prices.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Companies shown to be ignorant of EC market rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF the UK's top companies have a poor knowledge of European Community
competition law, according to market research carried out for Theodore
Goddard, a leading City law firm.
Only 4 per cent of UK companies knew that the EC could impose a fine of up
to 10 per cent of a company's turnover for contravening competition laws,
compared with 28 per cent of their French counterparts, the study showed.
The survey covered 50 leading companies in the UK and France with a minimum
turnover of Pounds 70m and a similar number of advisers including lawyers,
accountants and bankers.
Yet 84 per cent of the companies had been involved in a cross-border merger,
acquisition, joint venture or trade agreement in the EC in the past three
years. Almost all expected to be involved in such activity within the next
five years. All the French companies had recent experience of cross-border
activity.
Overall, 84 per cent of the companies thought that their understanding of
national competition law was 'fairly good'.
Even so, 64 per cent of the UK companies admitted a 'fairly poor' or 'very
poor' knowledge of EC competition law. The comparable figure for French
companies was only 8 per cent.
The research concluded that 36 per cent of UK companies failed to take
account of national competition laws and 64 per cent failed to take account
of EC competition laws to achieve strategic goals.
UK companies adopt a reactive approach to competition issues, it said, only
showing an interest when problems arise.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Optimist owes a debt to business failure:  Michael Cassell
discovers that the network of official receivers has rarely been busier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR George Barrow, as an appointed representative of the Lord Chancellor, is
not often called upon to break into a Spanish bank's safe deposit box with a
hammer and chisel.
Mr Barrow, one of 29 official receivers in England and Wales, was in hot
pursuit of an absentee company director and moved so quickly that he managed
to arrive before his quarry in the fashionable holiday resort of Puerto
Banus.
A brief court appearance gave him permission to carry out his break-in,
which yielded Pounds 35,000 in cash and some valuable property deeds.
Encouraged by his unexpected bonanza, Mr Barrow used his brief spell in the
sun to look up another fugitive. This time, however, his luck ran out and he
was forced by a snarling dog to vault a villa wall. 'It took me half an hour
to get into the grounds and 30 seconds to get out,' he said.
With liquidations and bankruptcies likely to have reached a record 24,000 in
1990 and expected to rise further this year, private insolvency practices
and the network of official receivers have rarely been busier.
As a member of the government's insolvency service, part of the Department
of Trade and Industry, Mr Barrow's initial role is to protect the assets of
individual bankrupts and of companies in compulsory liquidation.
He then investigates the circumstances surrounding their collapse, pursues
prosecutions when necessary, and can also have directors disqualified from
playing any part in most forms of business for up to 15 years. About 300
people a year are banned nationally, although they may trade again without
the benefit of limited liability.
In pursuit of his duties as an officer of the court, Mr Barrow has watched
for 25 years as people and companies run out of cash, time and excuses.
Most companies crash, Mr Barrow says, because they are undercapitalised or
over-optimistic but he praises most of the risk takers, who simply get it
wrong. 'I have a comfortable, secure job and am not about to criticise those
who have had the guts to have a go.'
There are some, however, who test his ingenuity to its limits - for
instance, the bankrupt who lives in a Pounds 500,000 house conveniently
owned by another member of the family and who claims he cannot pay his VAT
bills; or the director who returns his leased computer system - still loaded
with essential financial information - before the receiver calls.
It seems there are few new tricks in the book. 'It is quite staggering to
see the number of cars which are stolen with the company books inside. The
cars are recovered but, for some reason, the fascinated thief keeps the
books.'
Mr Barrow has a daunting range of investigative powers and considerable
discretion, encompassing almost everything except the authority to arrest.
Working within the Insolvency Act 1986, implemented to tidy up a mish-mash
of laws unchanged since 1914, he can call to the witness box anyone he
chooses and has access to private and corporate bank records. The new
legislation is generally seen as striking a fair balance between the
interests of the bankrupt and those of the creditors. In the bad old days,
failed businessmen had to sit down, empty their pockets and hand everything
over to the receiver. 'We used to have a safe full of watches,' he says.
'Nowadays we would only take a Rolex.'
Some of the businessmen he confronts are well-versed on their rights, such
as the plumber who claimed that the removal of his BMW saloon was, contrary
to the act, depriving him of the tools of his trade. Mr Barrow gave him
Pounds 500 to buy an old van.
Mr Barrow is the official receiver for much of the Midlands, the north-west
and parts of Wales, and has offices in Stoke-on-Trent and Chester. He and
his teams of examiners can act only on the order of a court, unlike private
practices, which can be recruited by companies voluntarily seeking
liquidation.
His immediate task, on receiving a court order, is to close down any
business premises - thereby protecting the bankrupt from unsecured creditors
 -and to take responsibility for all assets involved, for which he is
personally liable.
Mr Barrow can pay staff up to eight weeks' back pay, as well as redundancy
money to help soften the blow of what is often sudden, unexpected
unemployment.
He is critical of creditors, invariably government departments such as the
Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise, which choose not to seek redress via
the bailiffs but regard the receiver's office as the state debt collector.
'It is infuriating to find that, if they had only knocked on the door, they
need not have burdened us,' he says.
Most cases are concluded quickly, without the need for further action by his
department. Last year, his team carried out investigations into 10 per cent
of notified bankrupts and 25 per cent of failed companies. Only a small
proportion result in prosecution.
Being surrounded by failure has not made Mr Barrow pessimistic: there are
happy endings. Three weeks ago, he discreetly impounded a vintage Ferrari,
one of three insured collectively for Pounds 1.8m. 'The team which took it
away wore silk gloves so as not to scratch it. But the owner came up with
the money to pay his debts and we took it straight back.'

FT  07 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Rail unions to vote on Thursday Tube
strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of rail unions are to decide today whether to hold a 24-hour strike
on London Underground on Thursday after considering a six-point proposal by
managers to end the dispute over 1,005 job cuts.
The one-day strike might go ahead even if leaders of the RMT and TSSA rail
unions agree a settlement and decide not to continue with a series of
one-day strikes they called after balloting on London Underground's cuts.
The RMT, which represents 12,000 of the workers balloted on action, said the
Thursday strike could be called off today if a settlement was agreed. The
executives of the two unions would have to decide whether to do so.
London Underground said it had made a six-point proposal in talks at the
Acas conciliation service on Friday. It said it believed the proposal
addressed many of the concerns of the unions and hoped that a settlement
could be reached.
The corporation has warned staff that if they take part in industrial
action, they face being suspended and may be dismissed. It wants to prevent
a prolonged campaign of industrial disruption this summer.
The job cuts, including the loss of about 300 posts in ticket offices, were
planned by London Underground after it sustained an unexpected Pounds 92m
loss. It says that automation of ticket sales has made the cuts possible.
The unions have argued that they might endanger passengers as well as
cutting earnings in the long term. Among the cuts would be 30 jobs involving
the daily cleaning of dust trays under escalators on the network.
The rail unions are also in the middle of a dispute with British Rail over
the annual pay round. The RMT has decided to hold a ballot on industrial
action among 60,000 members in British Rail after rejecting a 7 per cent pay
offer.

THE International Labour Organisation, the United Nations agency, has called
for talks between the government and unions as a way of ending the block on
union membership at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)
communications centre in Cheltenham.
An ILO committee of experts has renewed its criticism of several aspects of
British labour law in spite of hearing a defence of legislation from the
government.
Britain may be asked to explain further at the annual ILO conference to be
held next month.
Although the government could ignore the ruling by the committee of experts,
it is a signatory to the ILO.

FT  07 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Teaching unions closer to merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF the smaller non-striking teachers' unions took a step towards merger
over the weekend. If the merger succeeds, the National Union of Teachers may
soon cease to be the largest teachers' union.
The 130,000-strong Assistant Masters and Mistresses Association and the
Professional Association of Teachers, with 39,000 members, have reached
provisional agreement on merger and final proposals are likely to be put to
members by next year.
Neither union is affiliated to the Trades Union Congress. The merged union
would be larger than the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of
Women Teachers (Nasuwt), with 20,000 members fewer than the NUT's 190,000.
In a joint statement, the two unions emphasised the need for a new, moderate
and professional image for the teaching profession. Mr Peter Dawson, PAT
general secretary, said the union would speak for the 'moderate majority'
and mark 'a new beginning for the education service'.
The new union would 'concentrate on representing the professional and
educational interests of practising teachers and lecturers'.
The merger terms involve the PAT giving up its no-strike constitution in
return for a commitment to 'respect and safeguard' those opposed in
principle to any industrial action.
Mr Peter Smith, AMMA general secretary, said: 'We still have a lot of work
ahead, but we are seemingly on course to create a genuinely democratic union
which will represent the authentic voice of practising teachers and raise
their professional esteem.'
If established, the new union would further increase the isolation of the
NUT. The NUT is the only teachers' union opposed to the setting up of a pay
review body for teachers. Last month the NUT conference voted to boycott the
government's standard assessment tests, a move overwhelmingly rejected in a
ballot of members last week.
NUT membership has been falling steadily, from 250,000 in the mid 1980s.
Combined AMMA/PAT membership has risen from 115,000 to nearly 170,000 today.
Nasuwt membership is stable.

FT  07 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): BP Exploration staff to assess
managers' work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BP EXPLORATION, the oil and gas drilling company, has begun to assess
managers according to the views of the staff working for them. Such 'upward
appraisal' of managers will eventually become one of the factors in setting
their pay.
Staff have been asked to fill in detailed questionnaires on their managers'
performance, rating them on a scale of one to five under several headings.
The scheme is one of the first in Britain allowing staff to assess managers.
The appraisals are in their first year of operation. They are not yet linked
to the pay of BP Exploration's 2,000 managers and supervisors but the
company believes they will be.
The 'upward feedback' scheme is unusual because most appraisal systems
operate downwards. Mr Doug Webb, the company's human resources manager, said
he knew of only five or six organisations in the world operating such a
system.
In Britain, W. H. Smith Retail introduced a pilot upward assessment scheme
last year. International Business Machines also asks employees about their
managers as part of a wider staff attitudes survey, although the results do
not feed formally into the appraisal system.
Experimentation with appraisal at BP Exploration is part of sweeping changes
in performance management in the BP group. Attempts are under way to
introduce a set of 'essential behaviours' such as innovative thinking and
team building throughout the group.
The company's new scheme, to run from October each year, uses the external
London-based consultancy Forum Europe. Staff are given questionnaires
listing 23 different management 'practices' which they are asked to rank on
a scale of one to five.
Examples of practices are: 'accurately representing the views, opinions and
feelings of staff up the line'; 'willingness to share power in the interest
of common goals'; and 'maintaining high standards for the unit's work'.
Staff are then asked to rate, on the same scale, how well their managers or
supervisors have applied them. The same rating process is applied to BP's
overall list of 'essential behaviours'. Individual responses are
confidential and results are aggregated by the outside consultants, who then
go through the findings with each manager.
Meetings are set up between managers and staff to help the manager to
develop an action plan for improvement. The action plan is then discussed
with the manager's boss and can be incorporated into objectives for the
coming year.

FT  07 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Performance pay bonus for postal
managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL MAIL is to pay senior managers bonuses worth up to Pounds 20,000
if they meet new efficiency, profit and individual targets.
The inducements are aimed at putting the Post Office on a footing akin to
that in the private sector by introducing 'a strong business culture' into
the state-owned corporation.
Managers taking charge of the nine independent business centres, replacing
the old 64 divisional districts early next year, will be offered bonuses
worth up to a quarter of their salaries, which are expected mainly to range
from Pounds 45,000 to Pounds 60,000.
Mr Bill Cockburn, Royal Mail managing director, re-fused to say whether
there would be penalties for those who failed to meet the targets. He said:
'If they are not successful, there are a whole range of things we can employ
to make them successful.'
Managers of the new business centres, organised in geographical areas, will
be in charge of their own pay bargaining, quality of service and
profit-and-loss accounts. They will also be expected to generate initiatives
aimed at boosting profits and turnover.
Mr Cockburn said: 'They will have much more freedom to think up their own
ideas on how to generate additional profits. They will be judged on specific
individual targets related to their personal performance.'
That might lead to fierce competition between managers in different areas.
If the manager in charge of Scotland, for example, initiates a scheme that
increases productivity, other managers will be under pressure to trump it
with an idea of their own.
In a separate move, the Post Office has established a joint body with the
Mail Users' Association, a pressure group that claims to represent
businesses with postal bills totalling Pounds 40m a year.
The Postal Forum is aiming to improve postal services.

FT  07 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): AEU chief questions Labour's pay
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSY over Labour's pay policy re-emerged yesterday when a leader of
the AEU engineering union cast doubt on whether Labour could 'square the
circle' of a national minimum wage and higher pay for skilled workers.
Mr Gavin Laird, AEU general secretary, said a Labour government might not be
able to introduce a national minimum wage unless there was sustained
economic growth because it would have to compress pay differentials to do
so.
Mr Laird's remarks came after the AEU supported a TUC policy endorsing free
collective bargaining as well as a national minimum wage. A TUC policy
document was amended after controversy over pay differentials.
The document now says: 'Any exceptional increase given solely for the
purpose of implementing the provisions of statutory minimum pay legislation
will not be regarded by trade unions as a vehicle for general increases.'
Mr Laird said there would have to be increased generation of wealth through
growth in manufacturing to make the policy work. 'If that is not done, you
can forget about the national minimum wage,' he said.
Mr Laird wrote in the AEU Journal before the TUC document was revised that
for employees in engineering and manufacturing 'pay norms and incomes
policies can be of no relevance'.
He argued that to fund a national minimum wage the government would have to
deliver a substantial improvement in the quality and quantity of training
and give manufacturing industry the same incentives to investment as in
Japan and Germany.
Although TUC leaders agreed unanimously on the revised policy which will be
debated at the Trades Union Congress in September, there has since been
continued evidence of the internal strain caused by the question.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Businessmen report revival of confidence in economy and
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH businessmen are more optimistic about future economic trends,
according to two surveys.
A poll of 300 members published today by the Institute of Directors points
to a sharp rise in confidence about the economy and their own companies'
prospects over the past two months. A survey of clients by 3i, the
investment capital group, found a marked reduction in pessimism about the
general business climate since January, with 56 per cent of those polled
believing the recession will be over within six months.
Both surveys have to carry statistical 'health warnings', however.
The latest IoD survey is not strictly comparable with the previous poll of
directors in February because of changes in the size and method of sampling.
The IoD said the changes in attitude disclosed were sufficiently large to
indicate 'a substantial shift in optimism.'
The 3i survey was based on 392 replies to questionnaires sent to a random
sample of 1,000 of the company's clients last month. The group says they
tend to be more profitable, more likely to be exporters and growing faster
than the average UK company.
The IoD survey, carried out in the first two weeks of April, found that 53
per cent of the 300 directors polled were more optimistic about the UK
economy than six months ago, and only 20 per cent were less optimistic. In
February, at the time of the institute's last poll, only 8 per cent of
directors expressed more hope about the economy, while 72 per were less
optimistic than six months before.
A similar recovery in confidence was found at company level, especially in
the Midlands and the south. Last month 56 per cent of directors were more
optimistic about their company's outlook than six months before, against
only 18 per cent in February. Those saying they were less optimistic fell to
19 per cent from 54 per cent in February.
Nevertheless, those improvements in sentiment have yet to be reflected in
company performance. The IoD survey found a fairly even split between the 40
per cent of directors reporting a drop in business volume over the previous
six months and 37 per cent reporting an improvement. No less than 49 per
cent of the sample said profits were down in the six months compared with
the same period a year before.
The picture for investment and employment was also mixed. While 62 per cent
of directors expected unchanged employment levels, a strong minority of
larger companies planned job cuts.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Official statistics on services to be improved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVEL AGENTS, taxi operators and fish-and-chip shops are among the
enterprises likely to come under scrutiny as part of a government effort to
monitor the service economy more accurately.
Services account for some 60 per cent of total UK output, up from about half
in 1970. Measuring the output of services by volume is often difficult. In
recent years that has hampered efforts to follow changes in the economy,
which may have been one of the reasons the government was slow to spot the
start of the recession last year.
One of the difficulties is that services often produce intangibles such as
assistance and advice. By contrast, in manufacturing, output can be measured
by counting products.
Under a new venture being planned by the Central Statistical Office, next
year about 10,000 companies in a range of service sectors will receive
questionnaires on a regular basis asking them details about their sales
patterns.
The sectors include catering, travel, entertainment and some personal
services such as dry cleaning. Altogether they add up to about 10 per cent
of the service economy.
The data obtained from the questionnaires will supplement other financial
information the CSO obtains from tax returns and employment figures, some of
which may be inaccurate and out of date. However, for public-sector services
where output is very difficult to quantify, employment figures will continue
to be the main source of information.
The scheme is part of a government effort announced last year to improve the
official statistics of services output and the balance of payments. As part
of that effort, 100 new staff have joined the CSO, a 10 per cent expansion.
The CSO has already begun collecting sales information on a quarterly basis
from about 20,000 service companies in areas such as advertising, law,
business consultancy, hairdressing, private teaching and rubbish collection.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Economists' figures reveal rapid descent into recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING failed to spot the recession coming, economists are now engaged in
the perilous process of forecasting a recovery.
Today's spring survey by the Financial Times of forecasts from 21 City
institutions, private-sector economists and intergovernmental bodies thus
amounts to an exercise in atonement.
The profession is paying penance for half a decade of error, after
mismeasuring first the strength of consumer demand in the 1980s and then the
gathering weakness of economic activity last year.
If economists do better at analysing the progression from recession to
recovery, it may help to restore credibility to forecasting. As it is more
difficult to assess turning points in the economy, however, errors tend to
be bigger at such times than during the upswing into growth or downswing to
recession.
That said, contributors to the FT survey will have taken note of the
Treasury's Budget economic forecasts in their production of an independent
and wide-ranging digest of economic prospects for this year and next. The
March Financial Statement and Budget Report (FSBR) is one of the two
occasions the Treasury goes on record during the year.
In its FSBR forecasts to mid 1992 - which updated the November Autumn
Statement - the Treasury said that gross domestic product would fall by 2
per cent this year, but with recovery starting in the second half. That
marked a swift downgrading of economic prospects since the Autumn Statement,
in which it estimated a GDP rise of  1/2 per cent in 1991.
The FT's survey of economic forecasts describes an equally rapid descent
into recession between the new year (the last survey was published on
January 3) and the aftermath of the Budget. The GDP forecast for 1991 has
fallen from growth of 0.1 per cent in the last survey to minus 1.6 per cent
today.
The election deadline of June 1992, the constraint of keeping sterling
stable in the European exchange-rate mechanism, the weak D-Mark and the
strong dollar have been taken into account in most projections. The
staggered cuts in interest rates from 14 per cent to 12 per cent were taking
place as the survey was being compiled.
What is now preoccupying the profession is when the recovery will start,
what will stimulate it, and how long and strong it will be. Some academic
economists are questioning whether there will be a recovery at all.
Most expect the trough to come in the third quarter of the year.
There are varying levels of optimism about what comes next. The economists'
1991 forecasts are marked by the gloomy Treasury imprint. Independent
averages for output growth (down 1.6 per cent), consumer spending (down 0.7
per cent), manufacturing output (down 4.6 per cent) and export volumes (up
1.4 per cent) in 1991 are only fractionally less pessimistic than the
Treasury projections.
When it comes to 1992, the Treasury expects a substantial improvement in the
economy, while the rest have yet to be convinced.
Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University's economics department
sees, after the trough, 'a small recovery in the fourth quarter followed by
no further growth until 1993'.
Most gloomy of all is Professor Wynne Godley of King's College, Cambridge.
He expects GDP to plunge 2.7 per cent, and the economy to continue to
contract next year by 0.9 per cent. He says the projected increase in output
will not comprise a recovery, being too weak to bring unemployment down. By
1992, unemployment will rise to 3.3m, he predicts.
Cambridge Econometrics, like many others, fears that the damage to
manufacturing is so great that lower interest rates will be insufficient to
lift the recession.
Mr Padhraic Garvey of CE says the economy is in a severe credit squeeze,
that the service sector will contract by 2 per cent this year and that 'the
short-term prospects for growth in many sectors are quite out of line with
underlying potential'.
With the corporate sector's indebtedness remaining at record levels, the
survey finds investment dropping by 9.2 per cent this year and remaining
very weak next year.
The Treasury's 3 3/4 per cent inflation for mid-1992 prediction is not
echoed by the independents. They are generally anxious about a 'faltering
recovery'.

FT  07 MAY 91 / DoE expects increase in quarrying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 66 PER CENT increase in the amount of sand, gravel and limestone extracted
from quarries in Britain over the next 20 years is forecast in a report to
be published by the Department of the Environment this week.
The DoE report envisages that demand for aggregates will rise from less than
300m tonnes a year to an estimated 500m tonnes by 2011. By 2005 it would
rise to 400m tonnes, a 33 per cent increase.
The forecast has led to a clash with conservationists who protest that such
a scale of mineral extraction for aggregates - which are used in the
construction industry - will lead to destruction of the countryside,
planning blight and an extra burden on roads.
Mr Ben Plowden, a minerals campaigner for the Council for the Protection of
Rural England, said: 'It means that more aggregates will be extracted over
the next 20 years than from the beginning of this century until now.'
Mr John Adams, reader in geography at London University, who has drawn up a
report for the CPRE, estimates that it will be equivalent to the removal of
an area the size of the Isle of Wight 11 metres deep.
The DoE forecast is based on an assessment that in the medium and longer
term the building and construction industries will show a much stronger
recovery than they did after the decline in the housing market in 1973-74.
The forecast, which is published every few years, will be the basis for
plans drawn up by county councils, which will then have to allow for that
scale of mineral extraction.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Building downturn seen to be deepening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recession in the UK construction industry, already the worst for a
decade, has deepened further during the first three months of this year,
according to a survey of 600 construction companies published today.
The Building Employers' Confederation, which conducted the survey last
month, said some companies were making suicidal bids to win work in an
effort to maintain cash flow.
Almost three quarters of the companies questioned said workloads had fallen
further during the first quarter of this year compared with the final three
months of last year.
The only sector to show any improvement was private house building. Sales of
houses had improved since interest rates started to fall in mid February but
the pick-up had been only modest. Orders for private-sector commercial and
industrial work, by comparison, have fallen steeply during the past 12
months.
Mr David Woods, the confederation's chairman, said yesterday: 'The
construction industry is firmly in the grip of its worst recession since
1980-81. Confidence about general workloads is at a very low level, with
nearly four fifths of firms expecting lower output during the next 12 months
compared with the previous year.' The confederation said that it saw no
reason to change its forecast that 100,000 jobs might be cut this year.
Mr Woods said he was concerned at reports of companies making suicidal bids
to win orders. 'Buying work at absurdly low prices is a recipe for
bankruptcy,' he said.
The confederation is Britain's largest construction industry trade
association. It has more than 9,000 members with combined annual turnover of
Pounds 30bn, more than three quarters of the UK total.
The proportion of companies reporting falling output had risen in every
region except Yorkshire. The recession had taken a firm grip in most of the
north of England and in Scotland, the confederation said.

<TEXT>
THE FURNITURE and carpet retailing sectors experienced 'appalling' trading
conditions in 1990 and continue to be the most depressed area of the high
street, according to a report by Verdict research consultants.
Spending on furniture fell by almost 6 per cent in real terms last year,
while the market for floor coverings declined by 7.6 per cent. Verdict
forecasts that the sector will be one of the last to recover from the
recession as buying furniture and carpets will remain at the bottom of the
shopping list for most consumers.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Ulster talks face delay in dispute over venue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DISPUTE over the venue for crucial talks between the Irish government and
Ulster's political leaders may delay the start of formal inter-party
discussions aimed at producing a historic new agreement for governing the
province.
Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, was due to chair the first
inter-party session in Belfast today but it was unclear last night if the
outstanding differences would be resolved in time.
Discussions were continuing to try to end the disagreement over the venue
for the second series of talks, during which Irish ministers and local
politicians will discuss relationships between the Republic of Ireland and a
new administration in the province.
Unionists prefer London for the talks while nationalists favour a location
'somewhere in Ireland'. However, the indications are that both sides will
accept a neutral venue, possibly the headquarters of the European parliament
at Strasbourg. Members of the various political teams who will be at the
talks were gearing up for a start later today.
The Northern Ireland Office was making no official statement on the
last-minute hitch, saying only that the process was still at the bilateral
stage.
Mr Brooke is expected to speak with the various party leaders this morning.
If there are no further obstacles, the first formal inter-party talks for
more than 15 years will later get under way.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Party rivalry will focus on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL THREE main parties are to focus on the economy this week as the Tories
aim to take the offensive and the opposition parties seek to build on their
successes after the local elections.
Next week's by-election in Monmouth, held by the Tories in 1987 with a 9,500
majority, now holds heightened importance in the wake of the Conservatives'
large-scale council seat losses with gains shared almost equally by Labour
and the Liberal Democrats.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor,
are expected to join the campaigning in the constituency tomorrow.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrats' leader, will assert his party's
economic credibility in a speech to the Building Employers' Confederation
today.
Mr Ashdown is to underline the party's commitment to an independent central
bank and an early move to the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism.
He will also spell out the benefits to business of the greater stability
that is claimed for proportional representation. The aim is to emphasise
electoral reform as the basis for successful policies across the board,
rather than as an optional extra.
Labour and the Tories rebuffed Mr Ashdown's weekend statement that any party
wanting Liberal Democrat support in the event of a hung parliament would
have to be committed to legislating to introduce 'fair votes' within the
lifetime of a parliament.
The renewed emphasis on economic policy began yesterday as Labour's economic
spokesmen launched a concerted attack on the government's 'complacency'
about unemployment and warned that the recession had not yet bottomed out.
Labour is also intending to step up its campaigning in southern England, on
the economy and the National Health Service.
Mr John Cunningham, Labour's campaign co-ordinator, promised that if there
were no June election then the party would give the govern-ment 'a long hot
summer'.
The Tories, meanwhile, seized on the weekend confirmation from Mr Smith that
Labour would abolish the present Pounds 20,280 ceiling on national insurance
contributions, to attack the opposition's reliance on higher taxes and
higher spending.
Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, said Labour's 'absurd' minimum
wage policy might add 2m people to those out of work.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Council tax bill forecasts seen as too optimistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first council tax bills in 1993 are likely to be up to nearly Pounds 70
higher than the government has forecast, according to a report published
today by the Local Government Information Unit.
The report by the research unit - which is backed by Labour-controlled
councils and nine public-sector trade unions - claims that the government's
council tax projections assume full collection of the poll tax in its final
year.
In reality, the report says, councils will have to set higher council taxes
to make up for the shortfall caused by the rise in non-collection of the
poll tax. The announcement of the abolition of the tax will encourage more
people not to pay it, the unit argues.
Assuming a poll tax non-collection rate of 5 per cent - 'a conservative
estimate', according to the report - the council tax on properties in the
middle tax band in Langbaurgh, Cleveland, would be Pounds 41 higher than
forecast. Those in the lowest band would pay Pounds 27 more, and those in
the highest Pounds 68.
In Solihull, West Midlands, properties in the middle band would pay Pounds
22 more than predicted, those in the lowest band Pounds 15, and in the top
band Pounds 40 more.
Even in Lewisham, south London, which shows the lowest rises of nine sample
councils examined in the report, properties in the middle band would pay
Pounds 12 more, compared with Pounds 8 in the lowest band and Pounds 20 in
the highest.
Mr Michael Carr, leader of Middlesbrough District Council and chair of the
LGIU, commented: 'As with the poll tax, the government has got in a muddle
with its sums. Its poll tax predictions were consistently wrong because it
failed to base them on realistic assumptions. The same thing is happening
with the council tax because ministers have rushed out incomplete and poorly
thought-out proposals.'

FT  07 MAY 91 / Warning over rail cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUTS IN rural rail services are resulting from reductions in government
grants to British Rail, the head of the official rail passengers' body
warned yesterday, Andrew Adonis writes.
The government grant to run services on loss-making lines has been cut from
Pounds 1bn in 1983 to Pounds 500m this year. It is projected to fall to
Pounds 345m by 1993.
'There have been savage cuts on some services,' said Major-General Lennox
Napier, chairman of the Central Transport Consultative Committee.
Lines affected include Cambridge-Bury St Edmunds, Middlesbrough-Whitby,
Leeds-Lancaster, York-Pontefract-Sheffield and Barrow-Whitehaven.

FT  07 MAY 91 / The improved competitiveness of the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS and JILL LEYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STAGNANT state of the US economy has been uppermost in the minds of US
economic policy-makers in recent months - but not all the recent economic
news has been bad. The US current account deficit has shrunk over the past
year - to 1.8 per cent of gross national product in 1990 from 3.6 per cent
in 1986 - easing fears that US companies can no longer compete effectively
on world markets.
The driving force behind the fall in the US deficit, and the contraction of
the Japanese and German current account surpluses, is illustrated in the
chart below. The international price competitiveness of US goods in world
markets, measured by the US real exchange rate, has improved markedly over
the past five years. This remains true despite the dollar's recent
appreciation.
These and other trends in inflation, earnings and competitiveness in the
world's six largest industrial countries are apparent in this week's fifth
and final table in the FT's new series of international economic indicators.
The most widely used indicator of inflation in all economies is the annual
percentage increase in an index of consumer prices. This index measures
changes in the prices of a basket of goods and services bought by an average
consumer in each country.
While inflation is on a downward path in the US and UK, the reason for the
Bank of Japan's nervousness over inflation is clear. The annual rate of
inflation in Japan has increased from 2.7 per cent in the first quarter of
1990 to 3.7 per cent in February. In west Germany, by contrast, inflation
has eased, despite the Bundesbank's fears about inflation.
The rate of producer or 'factory gate' price inflation may provide a more
reliable guide to underlying inflationary pressures. As consumer price
indices often include indirect taxes or mortgage interest costs, a tighter
fiscal or monetary policy, designed to reduce inflation, tends to increase
consumer price inflation in the short-term.
In the UK, for example, retail price inflation has fallen sharply since
November of last year, owing to falls in mortgage interest rates and petrol
prices. Yet the rate of producer price inflation has risen over the same
period.
With the growth rate of average earnings stuck around 9 per cent, UK
manufacturers appear to have been trying to pass increased wage costs on to
consumers, despite depressed consumer demand.
The fall of 0.7 percentage points in the annual increase in the earnings
index since its peak last July results largely from a reduction in overtime
working.
Movements in the real purchasing power of wages in different countries can
only be assessed by looking at the earnings and consumer price indices
together. Nominal earnings in the US rose by 14 per cent between 1985 and
1990, for example, but consumer prices rose by 21.5 per cent. As a result
average real earnings in the US fell by 6.2 per cent in real terms, but they
grew by 10.7 per cent in Japan and 14.9 per cent in west Germany over the
same period.
While both real wages and average earnings have grown faster in Japan than
in the US since 1985 the average domestic cost of labour per unit of output
has remained roughly constant in both countries. The reason for this is that
the average productivity of Japanese workers has grown faster than that of
US workers. Meanwhile, domestic unit labour costs in west Germany have risen
by 10 per cent since 1985.
Relative growth of unit labour costs between countries are an indicator of
the competitiveness of industries producing internationally traded goods. If
a country's nominal exchange rate is fixed but unit labour costs in the
production of traded goods rise faster than those abroad, its goods will
become less competitive on world markets. Equally, if the domestic unit
labour costs in the production of traded goods rise at the same rate as
those abroad, a rise in the country's nominal exchange rate will have the
same effect: the production of exports and substitutes for imports becomes
less profitable and trade performance deteriorates.
The real exchange rate series in the table combines these two determinants
of price competitiveness - changes in nominal exchange rates and in relative
unit labour costs. A rise in the real exchange rate indicates a fall in
competitiveness.
The depreciation of the US real exchange rate since 1985 is the product of
these two effects - the depreciation in the dollar exchange rate since its
1985 peak and the lower rate of inflation of US unit labour costs in dollars
than of European labour costs in European currencies. Together these explain
the encouraging performance of US export volumes in recent years and have
contributed to the contraction of the US current account deficit.
The FT has already published the following tables: National Accounts (April
8), Balance of Payments (April 15), Money and Finance (April 22) and
Production and Employment (29 April). Back issues can be obtained by writing

INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRICES AND COMPETITIVENESS Yearly figures
are shown in index form with the common base year of 1985. The real exchange
rate is an index throughout, other quarterly and monthly figures show the
percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year and are
positive unless otherwise stated.

THE Portuguese government yesterday resumed its privatisation programme,
suspended in January, with the sale of Sociedade Financeira Portuguesa
(SFP), an investment company under state control since 1969 and which was
recently transformed into an investment bank, Patrick Blum writes from
Lisbon.
Sale of the 9m shares was split into two main tranches: an indivisible 80
per cent tranche sold by auction, and 20 per cent reserved for employees and
other investors.
The auction for the majority share was won by Mr Jose Manuel de Mello, who
heads one of Portugal's large private groups.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Legal challenge to east German newspaper sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DM850m (Pounds 290.1m) privatisation deal ran into difficulty yesterday as
the German opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) announced a legal
challenge to last month's sale of east German newspapers to western press
groups.
Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, SPD party treasurer, accused the Treuhand, the Bonn
government's industrial holding company, of acting illegally in deciding the
sale of 10 former Communist newspapers in the biggest east German
privatisation to date.
The SPD is pressing an ownership claim to at least seven of the newspapers,
based in regional towns around east Germany, on the grounds that they
belonged to the party before its property was confiscated by the Nazis in
1933.
Mr Klose said a Berlin administrative court might decide as early as next
week whether to grant the SPD's request for an injunction to delay the
transaction.
Purchasers of the daily newspapers include west Germany's largest press
groups, ranging from Springer, which publishes Bild and Die Welt, and
Grunerand Jahr to the Burda and Bauer companies.
Mr Klose said the SPD was not seeking to regain full ownership rights but
wanted an economic stake in the newspapers. The party would also be prepared
to negotiate compensation.
The SPD is also complaining about separate sales last year of daily
newspapers in Chemnitz and Halle to west German publishing concerns friendly
to Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, foreign minister.
The SPD charges that the two politicians used their influence to steer
through the sales rather than putting them up for general bidders in the
manner of last month's transactions.
The Bundesbank yesterday warned that Germany's inflation rate could approach
4 per cent by the end of the year, in the wake of a landmark 7 per cent pay
deal in the metal-working industry reached at the weekend.
Mr Lothar Muller, president of the Bavarian regional central bank and a
member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, ruled out interest rate
cuts in coming months as a result of the 'stiff breeze' blowing on the
inflation front.
Mr Muller said the annual rate of price increases was likely to rise to 3.5
to 4 per cent by the end of the year, fuelled by tax increases as well as by
latest wage settlements. This compares with the present rate of 2.5 per
cent.
The weekend pay deal, coming after a week of warning strikes organised by
the IG Metall trade union, was reached for 700,000 workers in the
pace-setting North Wurttemberg-North Baden region in south-west Germany.
Made up of a 6.7 per cent rise plus other top-up payments, the accord is
likely to become the norm for nearly 4m west German metal industry workers.
The agreement is also expected to be adopted for 1m east German
metal-workers.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Yugoslav army eyes the power vacuum: Authorities struggle to
stop slide to civil war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE murder yesterday of a Yugoslav soldier in the Croatian port of Split
nudges the nation closer to an imposition of a state of emergency.
Authorities, apparently unable to prevent the country sliding into civil
war, remain divided over the political future.
Following one of the worst incidents of its kind for several years, in which
17 people were killed during clashes between the nationalist ethnic Serb
minority in the republic of Croatia and Croat police last Thursday, the
Yugoslav collective presidency warned at the weekend that civil war was a
possibility.
However, the way in which the presidency, which consists of representatives
from the six republics and two provinces, has regularly used such a warning
to restore stability has stripped the threat of credibility.
The political inertia on the federal level has led to a political vacuum,
increasingly filled by the federal army.
Many Croats distrust the army. They believe it is influenced by the Serbs,
in particular Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the nationalist/Communist president of
the republic of Serbia.
Indeed, more than 70 per cent of the officer corps within the Yugoslav army
is Serb. But the way in which Mr Milosevic has manipulated Serbian politics,
through his unique blend of one-party rule and nationalism, which is now
directed against the Croats, has led senior officers in the army to believe
their interests lie in maintaining the present status quo as opposed to
siding with any one republic.
The army's entire legitimacy (and financing) is based on the maintenance of
federal structures.
Croats also argue that Serbs, and elements in the federal army, will do
everything in their power to prevent Mr Stipe Mesic, Croatia's
representative on the collective presidency, from becoming president.
Croatia is due from May 15 to hold the presidency for one year under a
system of rotation in which representatives from each of the republics and
provinces serve for a limited period.
Against this background of age-old mutual suspicion and hatred, a
cross-section of Croat opinion believes Serbs are determined to provoke
ethnic clashes between the Serb nationalists in Croatia and the local
population, in order to precipitate a state of emergency or civil war. This
could pre-empt Mr Mesic's accession to the presidency.
Croats claim the federal authorities and army have been slow to disabuse
them of these feelings.
Why, for instance, they ask, have the federal security forces been reluctant
to arrest Mr Vojislav Seselj, a prominent Serb militant who spearheaded last
week's shootings of the Croat policemen?
Tensions between Serbs and Croats have been worsened by the latter's
distrust of General Blagoje Adzic, the hardline chief of general staff and
acting defence minister since General Veljko Kadejevic became ill last
month.
Many Croats believe General Adzic will do anything to block Mr Mesic's
appointment in order to atone for the death of his parents. They were killed
by the Ustasha, or Croat fascists, during the Second World War.
Yesterday's meeting of the presidency, the prime minister and the army may
provide a glimmer of hope for easing tensions.
But a Yugoslav official said yesterday he no longer believed the present
political institutions could end the cycle of violence.

FT  07 MAY 91 / EBRD draws up list of its priorities in east Europe: Bank to
focus on privatisation and restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE newly established European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will
play a selective role in helping the countries of eastern and central Europe
adopt market economies and will focus its efforts initially on such areas as
privatisation and economic restructuring.
In a first statement of the bank's priorities and policies, the EBRD said it
would concentrate on developing 'an entrepreneurial spirit at grass roots
level by helping the establishment of small enterprises'. It will support
their development by promoting a new financial infrastructure in the former
communist countries that could one day include a network of merchant banks
spanning the region.
The bank, which formally began operations last month, will seek a close
advisory relationship with the governments in central and eastern Europe and
will not hesitate to express its views to them on their political and
economic reforms. Senior bank officials have said that the EBRD intends that
its offices in eastern and central Europe should become the prime sources of
on-the-spot advice for governments in the region.
However, the bank admits that it will not be able to take a leading role in
all areas of activity. 'It expects to respond to country needs progressively
in a manner that is commensurate with the growth of its own experience and
expertise,' the document said. Especially in the early days, it will
co-operate and co-finance projects with other multilateral institutions such
as the World Bank and European Investment Bank.
The document goes some way to fleshing out the aims of the bank, which
remains a controversial institution under its mercurial president Mr Jacques
Attali despite declarations of support from member governments. Whereas Mr
Attali refers frequently to his 'vision' of the bank as the first
'pan-European institution' to bind together the eastern and western halves
of the European continent, the policy statement focuses on more mundane
issues.
However, the EBRD appears at one point to express reservations about the
current belief among western governments that eastern Europe must take rapid
and radical steps towards the market economy.
The statement was approved by the bank's 23 strong board of directors, who
represent the 39 countries and two European Community institutions that are
subscribing the EBRD's Ecu10bn (Pounds 6.95bn) capital. It says the bank
will place initial emphasis on programmes and activities that support:
the creation and strengthening of infrastructure, including regulatory
infrastructure and improved energy, transport, and telecommunications;
privatisation;
reform of the financial sector, including development of capital markets and
privatisation of commercial banks;
development of a productive, competitive private sector, including small and
medium-sized companies in industry, agriculture and services;
restructuring the region's industrial sectors to put them on a competitive
footing;
encouraging foreign direct investment, and
cleaning up the environment.

PAKISTANI officials have expressed relief after foreign government donors
meeting in Paris pledged new assistance worth Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.4bn)
for the coming fiscal year.
The consortium also committed Dollars 174m in assistance for Afghan
refugees, in a meeting which ended on Friday night.
Pakistan's budgetary deficit projected for last year was PRs57.8bn (Pounds
1.5bn), or 6.6 per cent of gross domestic product, according to the latest
government statistics. In the past, international financial institutions
have urged Islamabad to introduce measures for reducing the deficit.
The consortium asked Pakistan to give higher priority to programmes in the
social sector and the environment.
The announcement came at the end of weeks of speculation that the US, which
cut off aid to Pakistan last year after congressional objections on
Islamabad's nuclear programme, might influence other countries to do the
same.
India stirred the controversy afresh yesterday by alleging that Pakistan had
received a secret shipment of uranium at Karachi.
A senior New Delhi government official, who asked not to be identified, told
Reuters the uranium had arrived on Sunday and would be carried to Hyderabad
by military trucks on a road from which all other traffic has been banned.
Japan, concerned at Pakistan's foreign exchange reserve position, has
downrated it as an export credit insurance risk, Reuter adds.
The Japanese embassy in Islamabad said applications for insurance on exports
to Pakistan had been switched to a case-by-case basis since April 1 instead
of being automatically approved in bulk.

THE US and Uruguay yesterday signed a mutual legal assistance treaty after
almost a year's negotiation.
US officials say the treaty, modelled on similar arrangements Washington has
with many other countries, is designed to 'make it easier to gather evidence
for criminal trials'.
Concern has grown both in the US and Uruguay that Montevideo, South
America's only offshore banking centre, has become a focus of money
laundering operations by the continent's cocaine cartels.
Two weeks ago, the Uruguayan central bank introduced guidelines
'recommending' that its 240 banks, banking houses and exchange houses
establish the true identity of their clients' and the origin of their money.
Argentina's retail price index grew by 5.5 per cent in April, down from 11
per cent in March, the government announced yesterday. Annual inflation fell
to 348 per cent. April's rate was widely expected and confirms the success
of stringent anti-inflation policies implemented on April 1.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOVIET economic reform requires technical and financial assistance from the
west if it is to succeed, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign
minister, urged yesterday.
His plea was made during a speech to the Brookings Institution in Washington
before he saw President George Bush and Mr James Baker, the US secretary of
state, with whom he developed a close working relationship until his
resignation last year.
The US is opposed to direct economic assistance to the Soviet Union at
present, in view of its deteriorating economic condition and political
uncertainties. Mr Bush has not taken a decision on a Soviet request for a
further Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 880m) in US export credit guarantees to
finance purchases of American corn, wheat and soyabeans, though many
officials doubt whether approval should be given.
Mr Shevardnadze said yesterday these credits were 'a very acute issue' for
the Soviet Union. He said the decision 'will to a large extent determine the
fate of reform and democracy in the Soviet Union. We have very little time.'
He argued that the Soviet Union could 'not avoid getting assistance from the
outside. This is not supposed to be a form of charitable assistance, but
rather technological, intellectual and financial assistance on very
favourable terms.'
He said mistakes were being corrected and it was important 'to strengthen
the new tendencies which are emerging and head for cardinal reforms, for the
implementation of the laws which have already been adopted calling for the
transition to a market economy.'
Mr Shevardnadze warned that if these reforms were stifled there was not
simply a risk of material loss but also 'a return of our country to the past
would be a catastrophe.'
He repeated earlier warnings about the threat of dictatorship which might
emerge from a situation of chaos. This danger was 'very severe' during the
autumn and winter, but every day the threat of such a development became
less.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Yugoslav army on combat alert after ethnic clashes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
YUGOSLAVIA'S federal army was yesterday put on combat alert following the
killing of a soldier during unprecedented anti-military demonstrations in
the Croatian port of Split, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade.
Yesterday's clashes were the first in which the army has been directly
attacked and a soldier killed.
They raised fears that the military might impose a state of emergency. The
army's statement is also seen as an ultimatum to Mr Franjo Tudjman, the
president of the republic of Croatia, who has criticised its role in
quashing inter-ethnic conflicts.
It accused Mr Tudjman of encouraging attacks on the army in Croatia and gave
him two hours to stop any more.
The military has played a key role in trying to prevent open clashes between
Serbs and Croats in recent months. Croats feel that the army's intervention
in their republic is not even-handed.
The soldier was killed yesterday when fighting broke out between about
30,000 demonstrators and army units.
The demonstrators had marched on the Yugoslav navy headquarters in protest
against the military's alleged support for an insurrection by Croatia's
Serbian minority.
Thirteen Croatian policemen were killed last Thursday in gun battles with
Serbs in the village of Borovo Selo, north-eastern Croatia. The Yugoslav
presidency authorised the army to intervene to prevent new clashes.
Croatia's government yesterday claimed professional terrorists took part in
the the ambush of the police.
The demonstrations in Split, which were organised by Croatia's independent
trade union, erupted into violence after the protesters attacked two
transporters guarding the naval base, reported Tanjug, the Yugoslav news
agency.
Mr Tudjman yesterday called on all demonstrators outside military barracks
to disperse. For three days, demonstrators have blocked army barracks in the
town of Gospic, 120 miles north of Split.
At the weekend, however, Mr Tudjman had asked local leaders in Trogir, north
of Split, why they 'did not demonstrate in front of the headquarters of the
naval base, so that the world could see this is not only a battle against
(Croatia's) leadership, but against the entire nation?'
This provided the army with an opportunity to challenge Mr Tudjman's
authority.
Political leaders in Split yesterday demanded that the army should lift its
blockade of the village of Kijevo.
Ethnic tensions were raised by the army's blockade of Kijevo, a Croatian
enclave situated in the predominantly Serbian region of Krajina. Serbs in
Krajina, roughly one-third of Croatia's territory, say they will secede to
join Serbia.

FT  07 MAY 91 / ICI agrees 14% staged pay rise and cut in hours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION LEADERS at Imperial Chemical Industries are to recommend a broad set
of changes in working practices in return for a staged pay rise of 14 per
cent and a 36-hour working week for most employees within 20 months.
The rise will be in addition to the annual pay round, on which talks will
start shortly.
The deal, which will be voted on by ICI's 23,000 manual workers, would be a
significant advance for shorter working hours in UK industry. Engineering
unions are planning a campaign for a 35-hour working week by the mid-1990s.
The ICI deal was reached at the weekend by management and union negotiators
after initial proposals were re-jected. The deal could bring about the
single biggest change in work at ICI's 50 plants for 22 years.
The company improved its original proposals, under which there would have
been a 12 per cent pay rise staged over two years and the 36-hour week would
not have been implemented until 1995.
In return for the agreement, ICI workers will receive a 6 per cent rise as
soon as changes in working practices are implemented at their own plants,
and a further two 4 per cent increases over the next two years.
Unions were pressing for the money to be paid in two parts rather than
three, but ICI wants to contain costs because of trading conditions. The
company's pre-tax profits fell by Pounds 560m to Pounds 977m in 1990 because
of the recession and a restructuring charge.
The agreement would allow a 36-hour working week for manual employees by
January 1993, or within a year of new working practices being negotiated and
introduced at each of ICI's plants.
In spite of a decline in the overall level of earnings increases, with more
deals falling between 8 per cent and 9 per cent, UK companies, including
Lever Brothers, the Unilever subsidiary, have offered extra money for
changes in working practices.
Mr Fred Higgs, national secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union
and lead negotiator for six unions, said the deal would allow ICI
considerably greater flexibility in working practices and put it ahead of
other chemical companies.
A conference of shop stewards in ICI is to be held on Thursday to consider
the deal. It would then go to a delegate conference of ICI workers, and
finally to a ballot of all ICI workers before local deals are sanctioned.
ICI workers are currently on a 37 1/2 -hour week, and the 1 1/2 hour
reduction would give them among the shortest standard working hours in
industry. A 37-hour week has largely spread across the engineering industry
after a strike campaign by unions.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Impatient Bush returns to work: US markets reflect lingering
doubts over health of the president
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush eag-erly returned to work at the White House yesterday
after spending two nights in hospital being treated for an irregular
heartbeat.
The news that the previously fit and vigorous Mr Bush, who will be 67 next
month, has a heart problem sent shock waves through both the political world
and the financial markets. The dollar had weakened overnight on concern
about the president's condition, but rallied temporarily on the news that he
was returning to the White House.
In the US bond and equity markets, relief at Mr Bush's return to work was
overshadowed by lingering doubts about his health. The Dow Jones industrial
average was lower for much of the day but it recovered on light
end-of-session buying to close 2.78 higher at 2941.64.
Doctors at the Bethesda Naval Hospital said they believed drugs alone could
deal with a condition known as atrial fibrillation which Mr Bush developed
late on Saturday afternoon while jogging.
Dr Burton Lee, the White House physician, said Mr Bush had 'no physical
problems of any kind that we can detect other than the irregular heartbeat'.
His heartbeat returned to normal late on Sunday, became irregular again
early yesterday and then stabilised after he returned to the White House. Mr
Bush was discharged from hospital after the doctors decided against an
electric shock treatment known as cardioversion which they had warned might
be necessary. Doctors will continue to monitor Mr Bush's progress at the
White House.
Mr Bush, who yesterday saw Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign
minister, made no secret of his impatience to leave hospital. Looking fit
and well on his return to the White House, he said he wanted to get back to
work.
The weekend's events also raised questions about the low public standing of
vice-president Dan Quayle, who would succeed Mr Bush if he died. Under the
25th amendment to the US constitution, Mr Quayle would have temporarily
taken over the powers of the presidency if Mr Bush had had to be sedated to
have the electric shock treatment, which has so far not been needed.
Mr Quayle is still rated lowly in opinion polls as a possible president and
there was renewed debate in the US press about whether Mr Bush should retain
him on the ticket as vice-president in next year's election.

FT  07 MAY 91 / US to reopen Gatt dispute over Airbus state subsidy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SEATTLE

<TEXT>
THE US plans to file a second and much broader complaint in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) against European government support
for Airbus aircraft programmes.
Washington has already taken the European consortium before the Gatt
subsidies committee on the issue of Bonn's exchange rate support for
Daimler-Benz, the German partner in Airbus.
It plans to file a much broader complaint against direct subsidies for
development and production costs. It is also considering taking unilateral
action against Airbus, including special duties and quotas on Airbus
aircraft sales in the US market.
'Airbus still continues to distort trade although it now claims to be
operating profitably,' Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman of Boeing, Airbus's main
international competitor, said in an interview in Seattle. 'We feel
subsidies for both development and production are no longer necessary for
Airbus.'
Mr Shrontz said the US aircraft industry was especially concerned by
increasing subsidies for Airbus sales in the US. Airbus granted large loans
last year to Northwest Airlines and America West. Although Boeing also
advances finance to support purchases, it does so out of its own resources,
Mr Shrontz said.
In contrast, a substantial amount of Airbus financing in the US is done with
European government support, he alleged.
Boeing, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial jets, has become
increasingly frustrated by long and unsuccessful efforts between the US
government and the European Commission to negotiate a compromise. Mr Raymond
Waldman, Boeing's director of government affairs, said the US had made a
good offer to the EC to try to settle the dispute last December.
The US is seeking to limit government launch aid for new aircraft programmes
to 25 per cent of their overall development and production costs instead of
45 per cent as proposed by the EC.
Mr Waldman said the US had agreed on a 45 per cent ceiling for a three-year
transition period provided the Europeans accepted the 25 per cent limit
after that.
'At Boeing, we did not like the compromise because it was an open invitation
for European governments to throw money at Airbus during the transition
period,' he said. But the European Council of ministers rejected the
compromise and changed some of the working assumptions, according to Mr
Waldman.
The original plan was for launch aid restrictions to apply to all aircraft
of 100 seats or more. The EC said the new limits should cover only 140 seats
and over. The US suspected the Continued on Page 20
EC of trying to support European plans to develop new 100- to 130-seat
regional jets.
Germany, France and Italy are considering a new Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn)
regional jet programme. British Aerospace and Fokker of the Netherlands also
have plans to build a larger, 130-seat version of their BAe 146 and
Fokker-100 jets respectively.
On the German government's exchange rate support scheme for Daimler-Benz, Mr
Waldman claimed it was equal to a Dollars 2.5m subsidy for each Airbus
aircraft produced last year.
Although Boeing claimed Airbus was selling aircraft below cost in the US
market, Mr Waldman said Boeing was pressing the US government to concentrate
at this stage on the general issue of direct launch aid subsidies.
Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus managing director, warned last month that the EC
would use 'every legal weapon' to defend the interests of the consortium. He
claimed that Boeing and McDonnell Douglas had received between them over the
past decade about Dollars 23bn in indirect support from the US government.
Washington says Airbus has received direct subsidies totalling Dollars
25.9bn.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (11): 'A hand on the tiller for a
long time' - Patti Waldmeir and Michael Holman speak to President F. W. de
Klerk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARE you encouraged by the outline of constitutional principles put forward
by the ANC? What do you have in common and where are there potential
differences?
Areas of potential difference are definitely there, but there are some
interesting facets in their proposals (and) there are many areas of
agreement on certain basic principles. Areas of difference focus on the
(ANC) philosophy of very strong central government, as opposed to the
concept of decentralisation of power, and absence of adequate provision for
checks and balances to handle the problems arising from the diversity of
South Africa's society. There is no doubt that a broad consensus now exists,
that apart from a new constitution, there must also be a bill of rights, and
that individual rights - we also put heavy emphasis, for example, on the
protection of private property ownership - to a great extent can best be
protected in a bill of rights.
Even collective rights, in the religious field, in the cultural field, can
be dealt with in a bill of rights (but) I don't think one can write policy
into a constitution. You can write fundamentals into a constitution, you can
write rules into a constitution, but you cannot write economic policy or
social policy into a constitution. And inasmuch as their programme tries to
do that, I don't think it is acceptable.
On the issue of power sharing, do you feel that the principle of
proportional representation should apply to the executive?
Yes, the National Party has publicly stated that is its view. The Swiss
model provides an interesting model, where the main role players are
represented in the executive and where the executive operates on the basis
of consensus. (Our) fundamental departure point is that a winner-takes-all
constitution is very wrong for South Africa, it cannot work. I'm also on
record as saying that there should not be a State President with so much
power as I have.
How well do you think the National Party might do in an election, and what
kind of coalition might be formed?
I think firstly that the National Party itself definitely has the potential
to attract wide support across colour lines. But I also believe we must
bring together those who share the same principles . . . but we're not
pressing now for alliances . . . any impression of ganging up at this stage
will threaten the negotiation process itself.
But I have no doubt that when the real electoral process is in the offing,
alliances will be formed, and that there will be a moderate alliance in
which the National Party will play an important part, which has more than an
even chance to win an election.
Would you consider Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party a natural partner
in that alliance?
It's quite possible that the Inkatha Freedom Party and the National Party
can move into an alliance, but I don't think they will be alone if the two
of them decide to do so. The only definite statement which I have made is
that I can't see us in alliance with the ANC, as long as the ANC is in
alliance with the South African Communist Party, because the National Party
is strongly opposed to communism.
Is the National Party becoming over-confident? And is it taking seriously
enough the degree to which violence is undermining Mr Mandela's authority?
We are definitely not over-confident. The leadership of the party is deeply
aware of the risks involved, of the fact that we are dealing with something
which is fragile, of the dangers of continued violence as a factor not only
undermining the ANC, but undermining stability.
We are constantly involved in further planning to prevent violence and where
it occurs, for impartial handling of violence. Individual members of police
forces across the world sometimes make bad errors of judgement. But there is
definitely no pattern . . . Police are there to safeguard the lives and
property of all South Africans. Cannot more be done?
Let's just look at it from another vantage point, Mr Mandela also says he's
against violence. Have you seen some of his supporters participating in
violence? In our case it's the exception, in his case it's the rule. The
real perpetrators of violence, in the overwhelming number of cases, are the
supporters of either the ANC or some other party. The funny thing is that
the common denominator is that on one side you will always find ANC
supporters.
The government's recent White Paper on Land Reform took a strong line on the
restitution of land to those forcibly evicted under apartheid . . .
The White Paper states that a programme for the restoration of land would
not be feasible. That does not meant government is unapproachable.
Government's general approach to this issue is to address the cases
concerned with sympathy and reason What is the next step in the negotiating
process?
We envisage a multi-party conference. Its aim is to reach consensus on
underlying principles for a new constitution, as well as on the structure
and functioning of a forum for constitutional negotiations.
If consensus was reached on the principles of a new constitution, could this
be put to a larger body, going some way towards meeting the demands of the
ANC that the constitution be drawn up by this constituent assembly?
As I say, the conference's aim is to reach consensus on underlying
principles as well as on the structure and functioning of a forum for
constitutional negotiations. Almost at the top of the agenda will be - if
and when we agree on basic principles - how do we formalise this? What is in
a name? The ANC will no doubt say, let's have a constituent assembly in
terms of their proposal. We don't agree with the concept of a constituent
assembly, but we are prepared to give structure and formality to such a
forum.
But the one principle over which we feel very strongly is that . . . we
cannot create a constitutional vacuum in the sense of abdicating power to an
interim government, or a constituent assembly, or a negotiating forum. In
the final analysis, a new constitution will have to be passed by parliament,
as an act of parliament, and by parliament as it is.
Instead of using the term interim government, is it conceivable that the
consultative process could take on a more formal structure, so that there
might be a consultative body on education, on health, and so on?
That type of thing is not out of the question and if agreement is reached on
such a general approach I have nothing in principle against it. While
rejecting an interim government, we accept that there must be certain
transition arrangements.
What are your thoughts on the concept of affirmative action?
If affirmative action is to mean retribution, restoration, taking away from
those who have, dishing it out, I'm absolutely against it. But I'm fully in
favour of specific strategies to improve the quality of life of all South
Africans, to wipe out backlogs, to improve education, to in a dramatic
manner broaden the base of private home ownership, we're already doing all
those things. Human development is the major challenge of the future, not
constitution-making . . . I don't think one should ever, however, relinquish
the principle of merit just for the sake of numbers. I'm not in favour of
racism in any form.
How concerned are you about the right wing, the Conservative Party?
You earlier referred to over-confidence. About one thing I am confident: I
will win a referendum among whites. With regard to the extra-parliamentary
threat, I am not unduly concerned, but I think that might become a very
serious threat if we were not to succeed in offering to the public of South
Africa a well-balanced constitution with proper checks and balances. In
terms of power sharing, can you foresee any time when the National Party
will not have at least one hand on the tiller?
In essence a political party exists because it believes in its policy. And
the main goal of a political party is to be a winner at the polls. I believe
the National Party, because of its very capacity to adapt to realities, is a
young and dynamic party at this moment, although it has a long history. And
that it will play a leading role - not in a dominating sense, but an
important, fundamental role in government for as long as it retains its
character of thinking along lines of principle, and of not being
opportunistic, of having an open mind, and of constantly submitting itself
to the question whether it needs to adapt and reform within the framework of
its principles. I therefore think that because of its inherent strength, it
will have one hand on the tiller for a very long time.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (12): On the road to 'normalisation'
 -Michael Holman on international relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S changing status in the international arena was vividly
illustrated last month by the experiences of President F. W. de Klerk and
Nelson Mandela, the ANC deputy-president, during their briefly overlapping
visits to London.
At meetings of leading businessmen and before a packed press conference, the
South African president - en route to Denmark and Ireland - confidently
outlined his vision of a 'new South Africa', and pressed the case for a
rapid end to remaining sanctions.
By contrast, Mr Mandela, speaking to journalists in the same hall that last
year saw a triumphant appearance during his first official visit to Britain,
seemed a subdued figure.
Sanctions had to stay, he argued, adding that he was opposed to the visit to
South Africa later this year by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign
secretary. But his case lacked conviction.
In his heart Mr Mandela must surely have conceded what many of his senior
officials now acknowledge privately: sanctions are crumbling, and the
barriers to political, cultural, academic and sporting contact with Pretoria
are falling. The combination of reform at home and revolutions abroad is
making the process irreversible.
In the eyes of most outsiders - including an increasing number of African
states - Mr de Klerk has demonstrated his reformist credentials. And the
once reliable rear-bases for the ANC - the Soviet Union and its eastern bloc
allies - have been among the first to establish links with post-apartheid
Pretoria as they undergo radical reforms of their own.
For Mr Neil van Heerden, director-general of the foreign affairs ministry,
who played a key role in Namibian independence negotiations early last year,
the developments have opened new horizons. Today's objectives were once
unattainable: consolidating existing African links and developing new ones,
notably Nigeria; exploring opportunities in Pacific Rim countries;
cautiously assessing the trading potential of eastern Europe; and preparing
for Organisation of African Unity membership.
'Our first priority is to normalise relations with the outside world,' says
Mr van Heerden. Evidence of this 'normalisation' has come thick and fast,
often catching the ANC on the hop. Over the past year Pretoria has opened
trade or 'interest' missions in more than 20 countries as diverse as
Hungary, Togo, Ivory Coast, Mauritius and - later this year - the Soviet
Union.
Mr van Heerden particularly welcomes the fact that relations with the
European Community as a whole have dramatically improved. It seems unlikely
South Africa will be as divisive an issue for the EC as it has been in the
past. Shortly before President de Klerk's arrival in London, the EC ignored
the last-minute objections of a delegation of senior ANC officials, and
lifted its 1986 ban on the import of South African iron, steel and gold
coins. This followed the repeal last year of the EC's voluntary ban on new
investment.
'The decision again shows clearly how Europe allies itself with white South
Africa,' complained Mr Mandela. 'We are the victims, yet they reward the
jailer for letting a little more light into our hell-hole.'
Mr Mandela might well direct his wrath on states much closer to home.
It has long been the case that all but a handful of African states trade
with Pretoria, overtly or covertly: this trade is now flourishing, and South
Africa's diplomats are boasting of contacts which they once made
surreptitiously.
New links are paying off handsomely. According to the South African Foreign
Trade Association (Safto), the value of exports to the rest of Africa rose
40 per cent in 1989, and a further 22 per cent last year, making the market
worth some R5.5bn.
The ANC leader can derive some comfort from the United States, however.
Washington is still applying sanctions, banning imports of agricultural
products, coal, iron, steel, uranium, sugar and gold coins and other items.
It also bans US investment in South Africa, computer exports and direct air
links between the two countries. But the wall is likely to breached later
this year.
Last week Mr Hank Cohen, the assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, told a congressional committee that Pretoria had met three of five
conditions that must be fulfilled to allow the US to lift economic
sanctions: repeal the state of emergency and release detainees held under
it; unban democratic political parties and permit participation of all races
in the political process; and agree to enter good faith negotiations with
the black majority without preconditions.
The two further demands - release of political detainees or repeal of the
racially based Group Areas Act and Population Registration Act - are being
put into practice.
The process of repeal, Mr van Heerden estimates, should 'come to fruition in
the second half of this year'.
He acknowledges that what he calls 'second tier' sanctions - measures
imposed by cities for example, which are not susceptible to executive fiat -
will continue, but expects a gradual erosion.
The platform for any recovery in the South African economy, however, is the
region as a whole, however welcome the resumption of international trading
opportunities. Mr van Heerden stresses the link between a successful outcome
to peace talks in Mozambique and Angola, now under way, and South Africa's
own transition to democracy.
'If we can stop these wars, our part of the continent can take off,' says Mr
van Heerden. 'And our neighbours tell us: 'Whatever you do, don't
self-destruct, because we're depending on you to be the source of
technology, consumer goods, and so on', except the Zimbabwean government,
where President Mugabe still sees South Africa as the enemy, even though our
trading figures are going through the roof]'

FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (8): Shadow of scandal falls on
financial world - The trappings of capitalism are receiving some unwelcome
attention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA's popular Sunday press has been devoting an unusual amount of
attention to the activities of the financial community.
Alleged share dealing irregularities have compromised the reputations of
some of the country's most prominent institutions and stockbroking firms,
while a large banking merger was merely further grist to the mill of those
who think the activities of the financial sector have little beneficial
impact on pressing needs in the real economy. In a country that boasts an
influential and unapologetic Communist Party, such perceptions are
unfortunate.
The reality has been different, with the start of the year notable for two
important regulatory events: the passage of the Deposit Taking Institutions
Act (DTI), and the advent of a Takeovers and Mergers Code administered by a
Securities Regulation Panel.
The DTI has two main features to it: it levels the playing field between
banks and building societies, previously regulated under two separate acts
and subjected to different capital and lending constraints; and it brings
South Africa into line with the Basle Concordat capital adequacy
requirements.
The former represents an important shift from legislation being
institutionally based to it being functionally based. The latter reflects
the Act's main policy aim - the desire to enhance risk management.
The 80s saw some injudicious asset growth, the best example being the
Bankorp group, which landed itself in trouble after growing assets by 40 per
cent in each of 1988 and 1989. The new Act will force banks to concentrate
more on the quality than the quantity of assets. This is already evident in
the modest balance sheet growth shown by some of the country's bigger banks.
It has for some time been common cause that the banking industry's huge
investment in technology would be a catalyst for rationalisation, large
volumes being the only way to make the technology pay. The DTI encourages
this trend, as the higher capital adequacy requirements will ultimately be
beyond most small institutions, and because mortgages are only 50 per cent
risk weighted, compared to other forms of loan, in terms of the Act. This
makes old-style building societies attractive merger partners because their
large home loan books allow for cheaper growth.
All of these factors applied to the merger, consummated in March, between
Allied, UBS, Sage Financial Services, and Volkskas, which led to the
formation of the country's largest bank, Amalgamated Banks of South Africa
(Absa). The formation of Absa, which controls assets of about R50bn,
represented a tidying up of the banking interests of Rembrandt, the tobacco
and luxury goods conglomerate. The UBS-led bid for Allied was fiercely
contested by First National Bank, one of the country's other big banks,
resulting in one of the most highly publicised takeover battles in the
country's history. UBS was forced to raise its original bid, of R772m, by
about R100m.
One of the most salutary features of the takeover was the baptism of fire it
provided for the fledgling Securities Regulation Panel, based closely on its
London counterpart and fulfilling broadly the same role. The principle of
self-regulation of the securities industry applies, but an important
difference is that the South African code has the force of law.
Partly through the misfortune of having to unravel a complicated
jurisdictional issue in its maiden outing, and partly by its own hand, the
Panel's handling of the dispute brought a barrage of criticism, mainly
concerning the definition of what constituted concert parties for purposes
of triggering an automatic offer to minorities.
It is not the only one to have had a rough time of it. The investigation,
still under way, into alleged irregular share-dealings involving large
financial institutions and stockbrokers, has caused waves in the industry.
The transactions being investigated involve 'front-running', the practice
whereby an institutional investment manager and a stockbroker collude to
make an illegal profit by buying and selling on to the institution, at a
premium, a line of stock which it is known the institution plans to buy.
Three prominent institutional figures have already lost their jobs, various
stockbrokers have been charged with fraud, and the whole episode has cast
doubts upon the integrity of the investment community.
While the DTI and formation of the Panel are big improvements to the policy
environment of the financial services sector, there remain other important
issues to address. These include:
The second leg of the level playing fields argument, namely the extent to
which changes to the tax system are required to arrest the trend away from
discretionary, towards contractual, saving;
Addressing structural problems on the JSE, like low turnovers and poor
liquidity, which force brokers to rationalise;
The challenge to the banking community of developing suitable risk
evaluation techniques to set about meeting the needs of the rapidly
urbanising black population.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (10): Moving away from the political
arena - Labour
</HEADLINE>

   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA's trade union movement, at the forefront of the liberation
struggle throughout the 1980s, is rapidly moving away from the politics of
confrontation.
In the dark days of the mid-80s, when tens of thousands of anti-apartheid
activists were detained under South Africa's state of emergency, unionists
were often the only people left to organise opposition to apartheid. Skilled
at negotiation as a result of the annual pay round with employers, and close
to local communities through their links with workers, unionists led the
anti-apartheid front until black political activity became legal in February
last year.
Since that time, though, union leaders have played a surprisingly small role
in national politics. The largest trade union federation, the Congress of
South Africa Trade Unions (Cosatu), remains a member of the tripartite
alliance led by the African National Congress (ANC), and also including the
South African Communist Party (SACP).
But over the past year, Cosatu has taken a back seat in the alliance. The
leaders of the ANC - most of whom have little experience of modern South
Africa, having spent many years either in exile or in jail - have failed to
seek union leaders' opinions or expertise in drawing up policy.
When the ANC elects a new expanded executive in July, it is likely unionists
will be well represented. They will then face the dilemma of how to work
within the alliance, while guaranteeing their independence in the new South
Africa.
The experience of trade unions throughout Africa shows that post-liberation
governments often restrict or even repress union activity. South Africa's
unions are keen to ensure this does not happen to them. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa,
general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers and one of the
country's best-known trade unionists, says Cosatu will participate in
constitutional negotiations as part of the ANC delegation, providing support
staff for the ANC negotiating team. 'But we are vehemently defending our
independence, now and even beyond negotiations.'
Mr Ramaphosa, a leading political figure before the unbanning of the ANC,
says a high priority for the NUM will be to ensure workers are involved in
restructuring the gold mining industry, which has been thrown into crisis by
the low gold price (see graph below). Some 40,000 jobs were lost last year
and a further 40,000 could go this year, given the current gold price.
Against this background, Mr Ramaphosa says the NUM is willing to be
'reasonable' in its wage demands - but management must agree to improve
conditions, respect human rights, and negotiate issues such as job grading,
staffing levels and working hours.
In the context of such high retrenchment in mining - and with as many as 40
per cent of the population unemployed - the challenge for trade unionists
will be to ensure they are not left representing a small employed elite at
the expense of the millions of unemployed. 'The main thrust of our struggle
has always been to fight for the rights of all working people, including the
unemployed,' says Mr Ramaphosa.
He acknowledges this has led to debate over the virtues of a national
minimum wage. 'We need to settle on a minimum wage which does not leave us
with a massive unemployment problem,' says Mr Ramaphosa. 'It should not be
pegged at a level which industry cannot afford.'
In the end, says labour consultant Duncan Innes, last year may prove to have
been a turning point, ushering in a 'more constructive era' in which black
unions position themselves less for confrontation, and more 'to influence
future state and corporate policies from within.'

FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (9): A different drought threatens -
Farmers don't shout back like they used to, Philip Gawith is told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE residents of Pretoria, South Africa's capital city, woke one morning
this January to find their city paralysed. An estimated 5,000 white farmers
had brought the city to a standstill by parking an assortment of
agricultural vehicles in city centre intersections.
The farmers were protesting their financial plight and the alleged uncaring
attitude of the government. Mr Kraai van Niekerk, minister of agriculture,
says the protest illustrates the powerlessness farmers feel about their
future.
On top of the perennial climatic variable, particularly hostile in recent
years, farmers are having to deal with enormous political and economic
changes, none of which they feel they have any control over. For a
conservative community, this adds up to a most unsettling package. As Mr van
Niekerk noted: 'Farming in South Africa finds itself in the midst of a
profound crisis that has all the elements of personal tragedy, community
disruption and an uncertainty common to the state of mind which prevailed
during the Great Depression (during the Thirties).'
The chief concern of South Africa's roughly 65,000 farmers is financial.
Most of the 80s were drought years, and the past summer saw rains falling so
late in some areas that many farmers were left without crops. The farmers
have aggravated this adversity with some rank financial folly of their own.
The industry, which contributed R10.8bn (4.6 per cent) to gross domestic
product in 1990, 8 per cent down on 1989, has debts of R16bn.
The debt ratio (debt in relation to assets) deteriorated from 12.8 per cent
in 1979 to 27.9 per cent in 1985. It has since improved to 23.2 per cent in
1990 as growth in the value of farm assets has outstripped growth of the
debt burden. Nevertheless, with real interest rates of above 5 per cent for
more than two years now, anybody with large borrowings has been hurt.
Coupled with this, the farmers' terms of trade (ratio of producer prices to
farm input prices) continue to deteriorate - from 0.87 to 0.82 during 1990.
Field crops and animal husbandry went backwards, but horticultural terms of
trade improved. The price of farming requisites rose by about 12 per cent,
while producer prices of agricultural products rose by 5.4 per cent.
Consumer food prices increased by 16 per cent.
On top of economic hardship comes political insecurity. The government's
decision to abolish the Land Acts, which prevented blacks from owning land
in roughly 87 per cent of the country, has unleashed fears in the white
farming community that they face redistribution of farmland to landless
blacks. These fears have been manipulated by the Conservative Party (CP).
CP criticism of government, however, falls on fallow ground. For reasons
both political (most of the farmers now support the Conservative Party) and
economic (the state is seeking to lessen its role in the economy),
agriculture is no longer the recipient of generous state largesse. Spending
on agriculture in the current budget, R253.7m, forms only 0.3 per cent of
state spending compared to 3.7 per cent as recently as 1987/8. And whereas
R583.4m was spent on subsidies and rebates granted in 1988, this figure was
down to R198m last year.
Farmers, understandably, are unhappy. They were outraged recently when Mr
van Niekerk had the temerity to suggest that as much as R5bn of their debt
was non-agricultural - cars, holiday homes, townhouses and playing the
horses were mentioned. Part of their debt was also the product of bad
decisions - cultivating marginal land, paying too much for land, financing
long-term projects with short-term capital, and so on. Such straight talking
from an agricultural minister is unprecedented, a clear symptom of the
changing times.
Mr van Niekerk believes one way of improving the financial position of
farmers is via a more market-oriented approach to agriculture. This process
is already well under way with reductions in State aid and producer
subsidies, removal of import controls and deregulation of the excessive
state role in areas like marketing, pricing and hygiene. The days of merely
producing, without worrying about signals from the market is over.
Another big issue, which the government claims to be attending to on an
ongoing basis, is the role played by the country's 22 agricultural control
boards, which regulate the marketing of about 80 per cent of the country's
agricultural products. Although many farmers, especially weaker ones, favour
the boards, the trend is towards diluting their influence. Some query
whether they should exist at all. Mr Frans Venter, agricultural adviser to
First National Bank comments: 'Not one of the boards is really adding value
to the product.'
The other way to improve farmers' positions, says Mr van Niekerk, is by
increasing the purchasing power of the consumer. A combination of low growth
and a high population growth rate has seen per capita incomes in the country
recede. The key here lies in the extent to which the government can assist
in getting economic growth started again.
Is the government succeeding in getting the message that the short term
offers no solution, and that the farmers' salvation lies in structural
readjustment, both within agriculture and the wider economy? Mr van Niekerk
thinks so. 'They don't shout back as hard as they used to,' he says.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (7): Testing times for optimism -
Manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECADE of stagflation, domestic unrest and international isolation has
done remarkably little damage to the famous optimism of South Africa's
businessmen. The difficulties of transition offer little respite, but they
remain convinced that the 90s can't possibly be as bad as the 80s.
They argue that hard times have forged a lean and resilient business sector.
They also identify the considerable benefits flowing from the country's
readmission to the international arena, and the prospects of regional peace.
Their ability to deliver, however, will be tested as never before in the
years ahead. The country's real gross domestic product per capita has fallen
by an average annual rate of 1.5 per cent since 1981. Nobody doubts the
consequences of that trend persisting, and the responsibility for addressing
it falls largely to business.
The portents are sobering. The average growth rate between 1979 and 1989 was
only 2.14 per cent, compared to 3.02 per cent in the 1970-79 period. By no
means exempt from this was the manufacturing sector. Mr Ted Osborne of the
Nedbank Economic Unit calculates that gross domestic fixed investment in the
sector declined by an average 0.81 per cent per annum over the period
1979-89 - hardly the basis for sustained growth.
This should not be surprising - capital sanctions limited the country to
about 3 per cent growth per annum, otherwise balance of payments problems
ensued. This meant that the authorities had to douse any economic recovery
which threatened to gather steam, the net effect being a massive
disincentive to invest.
When the origins of future growth are discussed, three areas top the list.
First are those who will benefit from the shift in budgetary priorities
towards social spending. Infrastructural upgrading in black areas and the
increased supply of schools and houses should benefit construction and
related sectors.
Next is the 'second world' - those in transition from a Third to a First
World economy - consisting largely of black urban residents. They have
enormous unmet needs.
Finally, there are exports. It is broadly received wisdom that the country
should follow an export-led manufacturing growth path. This coincides with
the economy's shift from being import-replacement oriented to being more
outward-looking. The latest manifestation of this was the report released
last month by the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) on the
modification of the country's tariff regime. The report notes: 'South
African industry has been stagnating for a long time. The country's future
prosperity will be determined by its ability to play a bigger role in
international trade in industrial goods.' It recommends reduced tariffs,
lower import surcharges and a realistic exchange rate policy as essential
elements in making the existing industrial structure more export
competitive.
Although the cabinet has still to consider the report, the chances of it
being accepted are good, as it is consistent with government economic
thinking. This should bring to an end a long and debilitating doctrinal
dispute about how best government should promote export-led industrial
growth: through focused 'Structural Adjustment Programmes' (SAP), in
industries with perceived comparative advantages, or through a General
Export Incentive Scheme (GEIS), such as is currently in place. The report
favours the former, government having vacillated between the two in recent
years, to the consternation of the country's exporters.
A salutary aspect of the report is the line: 'These findings are supported
by the results of a number of previous official investigations . . .'
Sceptics wonder whether the government will do any better than its
predecessors in implementing the findings. However, government's clear
desire to place the economy on a structurally sound footing before political
transition may provide the necessary impetus.
South Africa's export performance in recent years has been mixed. Commodity
prices, especially gold, but also steel, ferro-alloys and platinum, have
been weak, and this has dampened revenues. What has given cause for cheer,
however, has been the performance of merchandise exports. In the period 1984
to 1990, covering the height of the sanctions era, these rose by an average
annual rate of more than 10 per cent. These trends are reflected in
manufactured exports, increasing from 18 to 29 per cent of total exports
between 1980 and 1989.
In 1990 the country's exports were R60.6bn, 3.1 per cent up on 1989 (up 4.3
per cent in dollars, to Dollars 23.4bn). Mr Wim Holtes, chief executive of
the South African Foreign Trade Organisation, says gold's weakness means the
country will do well to achieve 2 per cent growth this year. He believes the
recovery of world economies in 1992 will see a return to a 5-7 per cent
growth rate.
Mr Holtes says the euphoria surrounding the easing of sanctions and the
opening of new markets needs to be put into context. Remembering that Europe
accounts for more than 50 per cent of South Africa's trade, he suggests the
combination of South Africa's political reforms and 1992 single market
reforms in Europe will be the dominant trade dynamics for the country in
years ahead.
Eastern Europe, where South Africa has established an extensive trade and
diplomatic presence over the past year, has been largely a political and
media event. 'Economically the opportunities have been modest,' says Mr
Holtes.
The breakthrough into Africa has been more substantial. South Africa's trade
with the rest of the continent increased by 40 per cent in 1989, 22 per cent
last year, and currently stands at the level of about R8-9bn a year. The
prospect of South Africa, Mozambique and Angola reaching political
settlements will create positive business synergies for South Africa. Local
businesses have a head-start when it comes to understanding the environment,
and are sure to be participants in the infrastructural development the area
will embark on, as well as in the satisfaction of long neglected consumer
needs.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (6): Gold loses its glitter - Mining
is no longer the bulwark it was
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE declining fortune of the gold mining industry, suffering the worst
crisis in its history, dominates the local mining scene. The recent decision
by Gengold, the gold arm of the Gencor mining house, to close the
Stilfontein mine was both a symbol of hard times and a gloomy portent of the
considerable hardship that lies ahead.
Closing a mine is, ultimately, inevitable. But as Mr Gary Maude, Gengold's
managing director, pointed out, the difference with Stilfontein was that it
was not 'mined out' when closure was announced. It had a large, coherent
body of reef which could profitably have been mined at the real gold price
of five years ago.
Mr Maude predicts, and industry opinion agrees, that Stilfontein is only the
first of a number of such mines which will have to close. The broad figures
bear him out. At a gold price of R933 per ounce*, an estimated 40 per cent
of the country's gold is produced at a loss and 45 per cent of the
industry's labour force, or about 190,000 men, works on mines unable to make
a profit.
The industry is no longer the bulwark of the domestic economy. Tax receipts
from gold fell from 10.7 per cent of state revenue in 1981/2 to 0.9 per cent
in 1990/91 and its contribution to GDP was down to 8.8 per cent in 1990.
Where its influence remains pronounced is on the export front - last year it
accounted for 25 per cent of the country's exports.
however, the industry's troubles have wide ramifications, particularly in
the labour market. Approximately 40,000 workers lost their jobs last year
and that figure is expected to be repeated in 1991. Some see this as a
pretext for state intervention.
The root cause of the industry's difficulties is a relentless cost-price
squeeze. The last three years have seen revenues flat at about R990/oz.
Costs, however, have been rising inexorably at an inflation rate of about 14
per cent per annum. Result? A decline of at least 36 per cent in the real
rate of return over three years.
Producers' attention is obviously focused on what steps can be taken to
remain profitable. The main response has been a much greater focus on mining
where grades are higher, and returns better. Labour has been shed on a vast
scale. In truth, no strategy which might prolong the life of a marginal (low
return) mine has gone unexamined.
A worrying, if inevitable, feature of the present time is the declining
exploration effort. The industry mines about 100m tonnes a year, but new
mines are not being opened to provide the replacement tonnage. Most of South
Africa's better prospects are very deep mines which would cost about R3bn to
start. Analysts reckon the gold price will have to double before such
projects would be viable.
Gold's shrinking importance is shown by the fact that 1989 was the first
year in which profits from mining activities in South Africa, other than
gold, exceeded profits from gold. Also revealing is that in the year to
March 1990, 9.7 per cent of equity accounted earnings at Anglo American, the
country's largest mining house, came from platinum, with gold only slightly
higher at 11.9 per cent.
Although the platinum sector is having to deal with a fairly depressed
price, down from a high in February last year of Dollars 525/oz to around
Dollars 400 now, the price of rhodium - an important by-product of platinum
mining - has quadrupled in two years to current levels of about Dollars
5,300/oz. This is a function of the increasing demand for the metal in car
exhaust catalysts as emissions standards are tightened.
The buoyant price has boosted the profits of South Africa's mines, which
produce about 75 per cent of the world's platinum, although the price of
producing more rhodium is more platinum, a fact that contributes to a
perception of oversupply which puts a cap on the platinum price.
Bolstering this perception is the expansion plans South African producers
have announced which, if implemented, would add a million ounces a year to
the approximately 2.8m ounces the country produced in 1990.
The biggest talking point in the industry at the moment is the future of the
ailing Crocodile River mine, managed by Barmines, the platinum arm of the
Rand Mines group. The mine is estimated to need R350-400m to develop its
underground operations, money which could not be raised easily or cheaply
through a rights issue. Barmines recently held unsuccessful discussions on
the matter with Rustenburg Platinum, the world's largest producer, and has
now moved on to talking to Genmin, the mining arm of Gencor.
The outlook for coal, South Africa's second largest export earner after gold
with revenues of R3.52bn last year, is modest. Demand on the domestic market
is weak as a result of the recession.
The export market offers hope, at least for better prices if not volumes.
With sanctions crumbling, the Dollars 3-5/tonne political discount on South
African coal has started to erode. Contracts with European customers for
1991 included price increases, considered very satisfactory, of 3-8 per
cent. The country had lost about 25 per cent of its export markets in 1986
when major markets like the US, France and Denmark were closed to it.
South Africa will not find returning to these markets easy, as producers
like Colombia and Venezuela have become a force since it left. There are
also infrastructural constraints. More than 90 per cent of the country's
exports go through the Richard's Bay terminal on the east coast, which has a
nominal capacity of 44m tonnes, currently being extended to 53m. Even if
South Africa had more capacity, it is by no means clear world markets could
absorb this and sustain the price.
South Africa is also one of the world's big diamond producers and De Beers,
continues to dominate the world diamond market. Attributable profits dropped
16 per cent down to Dollars 911m in 1990 because of recessionary conditions.
*The real gold price is subject to exchange rate fluctuations as well as
international price swings: R933 would be Dollars 345-360.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (4): 'Bureaucratic monster' turns
against its maker - The education crisis
</HEADLINE>

IN A small, sweltering classroom in Alexandra township, 87 five-year-old
children sat on red and blue plastic chairs or knelt on the floor, using the
chairs as makeshift desks. The teacher battled for their attention as the
sounds of the densely populated township drifted through the broken windows.
There was no electricity, for as in 91 per cent of black schools in South
Africa, Skeen Primary has yet to be connected to the national grid.
'Effective learning is impossible under conditions like this,' said
principal Mr Matlhabegoane. 'The children are hot and thirsty and they don't
have enough books. I am surprised they continue to come to school.'
Skeen Primary is a typical township school - in the rural areas, facilities
are often more primitive. Results reflect the quality of the system. Last
year only 36.4 per cent passed the school-leaving examination - the worst on
record.
The political upheaval of recent years, in which school children have been
at the forefront, is partly to blame. But at the heart of the problem lies
the nature of the system itself. The state of black education, already
markedly inferior, received a further setback in the early 50s when Prime
Minister Hendrik Verwoerd adopted the policy of Bantu education, designed to
stifle the ambition of the 'native' and create a working class, and
entrenched it by different funding for black and white pupils.
Now, in the context of a changing South Africa with a growing and desperate
need for skilled and trained black employees, the government has accepted
that apartheid education has to go, and equal education opportunities for
all must be provided.
The steps they will have to take to dismantle the system are huge, and they
have yet to make a start. There are still 19 departments of education: five
administering white education, one each for Indians and coloureds, 11 for
black education - in and out of 'independent homelands' and 'self-governing
territories' - and one umbrella department controlling the purse strings and
setting different 'norms and standards' for the rest.
In only a tiny minority of government schools can children of all races
learn side by side in the same classrooms, under a new law introduced at the
beginning of the year.
Concerned organisations and educationists, spearheaded by the ANC, are
calling for a single education system with open schools and equal education
provision for all, but the prospects for fundamental change in this area are
limited by severe financial constraints. Mr Punday Pillay, lecturer at the
University of Cape Town (UCT), has calculated that between two and three
times the amount currently spent on education (19 per cent of total
government expenditure) would be required to equalise yearly expenditure on
children of all races at the current level of the whites. (While the ratio
of spending on black and white children has narrowed in recent years from
8:1 to just under 4:1 the disparities remain formidable.)
Black education has long lost credibility. Even Minister of black education
Stoffel van der Merwe has called it a 'bureaucratic monster' and numerous
academics, educationists and community members believe that not until a
single education system has been established will normality be restored to
the beleagered area of education.
In his speech at the opening of parliament in February, State President F.
W. De Klerk admitted the present education system 'shall and must be
changed'. But instead of giving a clear indication of how and when, he
appeared to equivocate: 'Distinctive or autogenous education, conducted with
government assistance within a single system by those who desire it, has to
remain an option.'
On separate occasions, two ministers of education, Louis Pienaar and Stoffel
van der Merwe, indicated the education system could only be radically
changed when a new constitution is drawn up. On the face of it therefore, it
seems education will be one of the last areas to be reformed. In practice
things may turn out somewhat differently.
At the request of Mr Nelson Mandela, deputy-president of the ANC, a joint
ANC and government working group has been convened to look at the 'burning
issues' - the lack of textbooks, classrooms and other facilities - and also
'procedures to establish a fully representative forum' to discuss a new
education system.
The working group has yet to report back or come to any concrete
conclusions.
The route to equal education is a matter of debate. Mr Pienaar and Mr Van
der Merwe favour a more 'bottom-up' reform: addressing the imbalances of the
system within the current framework, bringing into line the divergent 'norms
and standards', and gradually working towards equal provision of education
for all pupils irrespective of race.
They state that equal funding is impossible and growing backlogs will take
even longer to rectify. Eventually, Mr Pienaar believes: 'We will have to
apply whatever we have to a basic education, and if you want education after
that, you will have to pay for it. There is a great likelihood that
education at a secondary level will not be as free as we would like. We just
will not have the money to pay for everything.'
More community-based educationists believe the measures being taken do not
go far enough. They say children will not return to schools administered by
the politically discredited Department of Education and Training (DET) and
resume 'normal' education until the DET is dismantled and a unitary
department erected in its place.
According to Professor Charles 'M. C' Mphahlele, dean of education at the
University of the North, the government's first priority must be the
'top-down' formation of a single department - in essence, a cosmetic change.
Meanwhile time is running out. Figures calculated by Johan van Zijl from the
independent Education Foundation predict that by the year 2000, South Africa
will have a deficit of more than 500,000 skilled workers and an unemployed
surplus of 2.7-million unskilled workers - the majority black.
The philosophy of separate education is cemented in the Republic of South
Africa Constitution Act of 1983, which defines the concept of 'own affairs'
and defines education at all levels as an 'own affair'. It is this Act the
government is unable - or presently unwilling - to dismantle.
The reasons for this reluctance centre on the readily given excuses that it
will be necessary to wait to see the shape of the future constitution, and
that the economy cannot afford to restructure the system.
The other important reason - not as often heard - is that the government
knows it stands to lose a sector of its white constituency if the education
standards of whites are lowered, as would be inevitable with a wholesale
redistribution of funds.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (5): Where the central fact is
violence - Patti Waldmeir looks at black politics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA has always been a violent place, and 40-odd years of apartheid
have done little to promote a culture of political and ethnic tolerance.
Indeed, apartheid was based on the premise that different ethnic groups
could not live together in peace; segregation of races and of tribes was
essential to avoid genocidal conflict.
'People have always had drummed into their heads that there are primordial
conflicting interests between ethnic groups, that's why we need apartheid;
now they're beginning to think, maybe those people were right,' says Mr
Pallo Jordan, Director of Information for the African National Congress
(ANC), referring to the township violence which has left nearly 10,000
people dead since 1984.
The vast majority of deaths have occurred in fighting between rival black
groups. Sometimes the rivalry has been political, sometimes tribal,
sometimes purely criminal. Often, it has seemed to be, in Mr Jordan's words,
'primordial': unexplained and inexplicable, bestial and terrifying beyond
words.
Armed men mow down mourners at a funeral vigil in the black township of
Alexandra near Johannesburg. On the kitchen floor lie the brains of one dead
mourner. An elderly lady covers them with a bowl, and asks: 'Where is God
all the time?'
Nobody can explain the Alexandra tragedy. The headlines said it was a clash
between the (mainly Zulu) Inkatha Freedom Party and the ANC; but the
mourners were not primarily ANC, nor is there any proof that the attackers
were from Inkatha. The ANC blamed the police; but their only proven sin was
to fail to give the mourners sufficient protection.
Dr Tim Wilson, who runs the nearby Alexandra Health Clinic, says the
township is witnessing 'the triumph of thuggery, not ideology'. Political
parties may use the violence to their benefit, as they battle for a powerful
position in negotiations on a post-apartheid constitution. But he argues
that the fighting is not mainly political. 'Once you get the gangs going,'
he concludes, 'the thing takes on its own momentum.'
In many of the affected townships, isolating the political from the tribal
or criminal is now impossible; evaluating the role of the police is equally
difficult. The ANC accuses police of active involvement in the violence
which spread last August from politically divided Natal province (where most
deaths have occurred) to townships near Johannesburg.
Police, it says, have armed, transported and protected Inkatha vigilantes
who attack ANC supporters. Those claims are difficult to prove, but there is
ample evidence that police - who were trained to regard the ANC as
terrorists and murderers - have at the very least failed to keep warring
factions apart. Journalists who have witnessed the violence are convinced
the security forces often side, actively or passively, with Inkatha.
Wherever the fault lies, violence is the central fact of black political
life at the moment. Geographically, it is localised, concentrated in Natal
and in a handful of townships near Johannesburg. But its effect is
nationwide: the broad anti-apartheid front forged in the mid-1980s, the
height of repression, has begun to splinter.
So far, the main political victim of the fighting has been the ANC, which
could previously claim the broadest support. The violence has stirred ethnic
fears in almost every South African community: among whites, Indians, and
coloureds; among Zulus, Xhosas, Sothos and Tswanas. Mr Jordan of the ANC
acknowledges that if the violence continues, Indians and coloureds may look
to the National Party to protect them.
Among blacks, the ANC's support has certainly declined. Most victims have
come from the ranks of the ANC: 'People are beginning to say, if we join the
ANC we will be killed,' says one senior ANC official. He argues that
violence has prevented the ANC from organising as a political party; it has
had little choice but to persist with the rhetoric and tactics of the
liberation struggle, threatening to form people's defence committees to
protect supporters disillusioned with its moderate stance.
ANC leaders believe the government has turned a blind eye to violence
precisely because it weakens them, and favours Inkatha, whose political and
economic policies coincide more closely with those of the Nationalists.
Pretoria denies this; but whatever the intent, Inkatha support has surged in
the affected areas.
Minority black tribes have begun to look to Inkatha for protection. In the
lawless atmosphere of the townships, the image of the warlike Zulu dressed
for battle is a powerful one, and Inkatha exploits this overtly tribal
appeal. Mr Musa Myeni, a member of Inkatha's central committee, says
membership in the greater Johannesburg area has risen 35 per cent, and total
national membership is now 2.2m. Card-carrying ANC members probably do not
number more than 250,000 or 300,000.
It is impossible to know whether this realignment in black politics will
prove permanent. Certainly, membership figures give no reliable guide to
voting intentions: Inkatha membership is compulsory in many rural Natal
villages; and many more blacks would vote ANC than would join its ranks as
members. But if violence persists, the ANC could well see its support
continue to decline, raising the possibility that it could fail to gain a
majority in the first post-apartheid election.
Under these circumstances, one can hardly be sanguine about the chances for
peace. Mr Nelson Mandela and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of Inkatha have met
twice to agree peace deals; but away from the conference table, each leader
has continued sniping at the other, and further peace plans are in abeyance.
Local accords have been struck to stop the violence in some areas of Natal,
but the killing continues elsewhere, with more than 600 dead in the first
three months of this year. Mr Myeni of Inkatha says this is just the
beginning: 'We know if we say now, do it, it will be hell, real hell,' he
warns, arguing that the ANC's threat to form defence committees may provoke
Inkatha to mobilise what he says is a force of 500,000 fighting men.
South Africa is not Beirut, or even Algeria; the scale of the violence has
not reached those levels. Perhaps it will emerge from this period of
political puberty unscathed. But a culture of intolerance and violence is
taking root in the townships; every party, black and white, must have an
interest in stopping this process.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (2): A long way from the land of milk
and honey - The lifting of sanctions is unlikely to lift the economic gloom
</HEADLINE>

EVERY day in South Africa, 1,000 young people enter the workforce. Of these,
875 find no job, says Mr John Kane-Berman, director of the Institute of Race
Relations.
That will not change when the last vestiges of apartheid have disappeared,
nor will non-racial elections alter it. Even the lifting of sanctions will
probably have no dramatic short-term effect.
Indeed, it is difficult to be sanguine about the prospects for economic
growth and employment in South Africa over the next 4 to 5 years. 'It will
take time for the new South Africa to establish credibility,' warns Mr Chris
Stals, governor of the South African Reserve Bank (central bank). 'The
take-off may not occur until the mid-1990s, when the new government has been
in power for a year or two. For the next few years we must be modest about
what to expect from the economy.'
Mr Barend du Plessis, the finance minister, underlines the consequences of
this: 'Unless we can get growth going now, by the mid-1990s it will be
virtually impossible for any government to govern this country, because of
the number of unemployed.'
Some businessmen dismiss this apocalyptic vision as 'politician's talk'. Mr
du Plessis makes no secret of the fact that his message is partly political.
'It is a message to opposing political groupings in South Africa: look
fellas, if you want to play the sanctions game, you will now be playing it
not only at the expense of people who are directly disadvantaged . . . but
you are now putting that very government in which you would like to
participate, if not take over . . . you are jeopardising (its) chances of
governing a governable South Africa.'
The scenario he draws is not unrealistic, and represents the worst possible
background for negotiations on a post-apartheid constitution. The economy
contracted by 1 per cent in real terms last year, and a further decline, or
at best zero growth, is expected this year. Meanwhile the black labour force
grows by 3 per cent a year, and jobless totals soar.
Professor Jan Lombard, formerly deputy governor of the Reserve Bank,
estimates that of the 12m-strong workforce, only 8m are in formal
employment. 'About 4m are without formal job opportunities and have to eke
out a living in one way or another.' He projects this figure will grow to 6m
by the year 2000. But the Institute for Futures Research of the University
of Stellenbosch draws an even bleaker picture: assuming economic growth of
3.1 per cent for the period 1988 - 2000 (which may well prove unattainable),
nearly 8m people, or more than 44 per cent of the population, will be
without formal sector jobs by the end of the century.
Mr Stals and Mr du Plessis recognise the threat posed by every one of the
875 youths who join jobless queues each day: under-educated and highly
politicised, they have no vested interest in the survival of capitalism in
South Africa, or even in a peaceful transition to a post-apartheid society.
But they refuse to abandon their efforts at structural adjustment, which
involve the tightest fiscal and monetary policies pursued for many years.
Economists disagree on whether the 1991/92 budget will turn out to be mildly
expansionary or just neutral; but certainly, it reflects no serious move to
stimulate growth. Mr Stals constantly reiterates his opposition to any
politically-motivated relaxation in monetary policy. 'I have no problem
defending myself against pressure to use monetary policy to stimulate
growth. Even if it succeeded, it would only be temporary,' he says. So far,
he has managed a degree of independence which would make a happy man of any
Western central banker; it remains to be seen whether that will survive once
real constitutional negotiations begin.
Without access to the facilities of the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
currently blocked under US sanctions legislation, Mr du Plessis believes
slow growth would resume by the end of this year or early in 1992, 'but only
a very modest growth rate . . . for a short period of time . . . which will
be totally inadequate . . .'
Even if faster growth were possible, Pretoria could not allow it. The
pattern of the past five years would prevail: growth would be restricted to
avoid a surge in imports, which in turn would threaten the balance of
payments surplus needed to service South Africa's foreign debt. 'We would
achieve another 1.5 to 2 per cent in two years from now,' Mr du Plessis
says, adding growth would fluctuate near that ceiling rather than at the 4
to 4.5 per cent needed to keep pace with rapid population growth.
With access to IMF support - Mr du Plessis hopes normal relations will be
re-established by year-end, and estimates Dollars 2bn might be available -
'we would have confidence to let go of the economy, not to hold the reins so
tightly,' he says. Still, he remains cautious about growth: 'We would be
able to phase out exchange control, so what will happen? How many foreign
investors will indeed take their money out, what will be the flow of money
back to South Africa?'
Already, as sanctions begin to recede, capital flows are being influenced
more by what Mr Stals calls 'normal economic factors'. But those do not yet
favour long-term investment: recent violence and uncertainty over future
economic policy have shaken investor confidence. Foreign trade missions are
numerous, but commitments few. 'We've had more visitors in the past year
than in the previous five,' says Mr Meyer Kahn, group managing director at
South African Breweries. But he adds: 'That's partly political, and partly
because we have a superb summer climate: they pack five sets of swimming
trunks for every suit.'
Mr Stals says investment will come with political progress, including
lending at commercial rates from the World Bank: 'By the mid-1990s . . . I
think we're going to pull in a lot of foreign capital,' he says. 'We will
become a conduit for those who want to invest in the southern African
region.'
Businessmen point out, however, that Pretoria has always traded with its
neighbours, albeit illicitly, and that the removal of sanctions may not
provide the hoped-for boost. They note that Africa as a whole represents
only 3 per cent of world trade, and South Africa makes up a third of that
already. Given black Africa's debt problems, its prospects as a market for
Pretoria may turn out to be limited.
Nonetheless, Mr Kahn and many other businessmen remain optimistic about
post-sanctions prospects: 'We are underborrowed, we've adjusted to
sanctions, found new markets, there is a better relationship between labour
and management, our businesses are tougher, and we are leaner.'
Mr Conrad Strauss, group managing director of Stanbic, one of South Africa's
largest banking groups, offers a more sober vision: 'The best we can hope
for is that we leave this century in a greater state of socio-economic grace
than when we entered it.'
The scale of South African poverty is daunting: according to Mr Kane-Berman,
20m people have no access to electricity; 80 per cent of rural dwellers do
not have enough clean water; 84 per cent in rural areas live below the
so-called 'minimum living level' of R700 a month for a family of five. And
by 2010, there will be nearly 60m people in South Africa, twice the 1980
census level. It is far from clear that the post-apartheid economy will be
up to the task of housing, feeding, clothing and employing that many people.
Black South Africans may find that life after apartheid remains a struggle.

Economic Policy

THE African National Congress aims to guarantee every one of South Africa's
37m people the right to decent housing, education, health care and a job.
Indeed, it plans to enshrine these Utopian rights in a new constitution.
Over the past year, however, the magnitude of this task has begun to tame
the rhetoric and temper the fury of even the most radical ANC economist.
After years of exile in under-developed countries in Africa or the Eastern
bloc, many have had their first sustained exposure to a first world economy
since returning to South Africa; they have spent the past year testing
ideology against the realities of high population growth and low
productivity, skills shortages and poor education.
All agree more work needs to be done before the ANC can finalise economic
policy. Government officials welcome this flexibility, while most
businessmen believe the ANC will come round to capitalism in the end - or if
not, that it will lack the political power to enforce an alternative.
Taking a snapshot of ANC economic policy is difficult: policy formulation
has been farmed out to several dozen economists, based at universities
throughout the country as well as at the ANC Department of Economic Policy
in Johannesburg. The vast majority are academics; few have business
experience.
Mr Tito Mboweni, deputy head of the Economics Department, acts as spokesman:
'Whatever economic regeneration takes place, it must be in the context of a
totally reorganised South African society, total reorganised,' he says.
He is not unaware that talk of 'total reorganisation' will strike fear in
the businessman's heart; but his vision turns out to be less than radical:
'A totally reorganised society must focus on asset ownership, education,
skills training, research and development, special employment programmes,
perhaps, to absorb some of the 5m-plus unemployed.' South Africa must no
longer rely on primary commodity production; its industry must add value to
the country's natural resources through greater beneficiation. Apart from
the focus on asset ownership, there is little in this to shock Pretoria,
which preaches similar values.
Reorganisation will also include 'deconglomeratisation': reducing the
extreme centralisation of economic power in few corporate hands. 'Basically,
they (the top four conglomerates) are far too powerful,' says Mr Mboweni.
But he points out: 'That's a political, not an economic point.' He adds:
'There's no certainty that an anti-conglomerate policy will lead to greater
efficiency.'
Mr Mboweni gestures at the tangle of Anglo American Corporation
cross-holdings, set out in a chart on his wall, and speaks of adopting an
aggressive anti-trust policy to promote competition. Only months ago, he
would point to the same chart with visceral dislike, and propose a massive
programme of forced disinvestment. Now he comments: 'The process of
democratising the economy will be complex,' and adds: 'It's clear you need
large companies to compete internationally.' He concludes: 'We're concerned
that whatever policy we adopt should not destroy the productive capacity of
the private sector.'
These moderate comments give business little cause for alarm; but until firm
policies are adopted on issues such as nationalisation, investors will
remain wary. Certainly, the ANC's draft investment code will do little to
entice them: it sets out a catalogue of demands foreign investors must
satisfy, including forced reinvestment of profits and obligatory affirmative
action, yet offers only vague reassurances on expropriation and repatriation
of profits.
The ANC says it is committed to a mixed economy, but the nature of the mix
remains unclear. Mr Mboweni, in a recent paper in which he declares himself
in favour of a Swedish-style social democratic economy, asserts: 'It will be
unavoidable in South Africa . . . that a future state will own and control a
significant percentage of productive resources.' He argues for
redistribution of income, of educational opportunities, infrastructural
spending, 'power relations on the shop floor', land and economic resources.
But if there are social democrats in the ANC, there are also leading members
of the South African Communist Party, who argue that a period of 'economic
dislocation' will be inevitable to eradicate the gross inequalities of South
African society. Nobody can yet be sure whose vision of the economic 'mix'
will dominate; ANC economic policy remains in the balance.

systematically removed. Violence, however, has delayed talks on a new
constitution. Patti Waldmeir discusses whether a peaceful transition to a
multiracial democracy is still possible

THE first post-apartheid government in South Africa will not be a black one.
By choice or by necessity, white and black political parties will rule by
coalition. After 42 years of domination by a single party - the National
Party (NP), which imposed apartheid to keep blacks out of power - South
Africa is about to enter the era of power sharing.
On the face of it, there seems little evidence that South Africa's
democratic culture is strong enough to support power sharing: since 1984,
nearly 10,000 blacks have been killed in political and tribal rivalry;
displays of political intolerance by both whites and blacks sully the image
of the new South Africa.
But in the 15 months since true multi-party politics became possible in
South Africa - following the legalisation of black political organisations
in February last year - it has become increasingly apparent that no single
political party will be able to govern alone. Even the African National
Congress (ANC), the only organisation with a chance of gaining an overall
majority in non-racial elections, has made clear it would include opposing
political parties in the first post-apartheid government.
'A coalition government is what we're fighting for,' says Mrs Lyndall
Shope-Mafole deputy chairperson of the ANC youth league. Mrs Shope-Mafole
represents South Africa's largest radical constituency: the 400,000-strong
youth league, the 'lost generation' whose youth and education fell victim to
the struggle.
The rhetoric of the liberation struggle demanded a 'transfer of power'. But
the reality is that, while the National Party has given up on apartheid, it
has by no means given up its ambitions to rule. Shocked and traumatised by
the decision to let blacks fully into politics for the first time in 350
years, the National Party one year ago seemed uncertain of its future role.
'One of our problems was to get away from the notion that our future
political function would be to fight a rearguard action to protect minority
rights,' says Mr Gerrit Viljoen, minister of constitutional development the
government's and chief constitutional negotiator.
Now the Nationalists are convinced of a much grander political future: the
past year has allowed them to take the measure of their political opponents,
and they are not impressed. They have found it embarrassingly easy to remain
one step ahead of the ANC on tactical issues: rather than retiring
gracefully to declare victory, the ANC continues to cling to sanctions with
ever less effect; and its threats of mass protest action ring hollow. It is
poorly organised and inefficient, and lacks policies on a range of important
issues.
Government officials now speak openly of forming a 'Christian democrat'
coalition or alliance, to claim the middle ground in South African politics,
and to oppose a 'socialist' coalition led by the ANC and its close ally, the
South African Communist Party (SACP). They believe that most whites, a
potentially large number of the 3m coloured (mixed race) and 1m Indians, and
a significant number of black Africans would support such a grouping. The
Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party - which claims 2.2m members and shares many
policies with the reborn Nationalists - would be a likely member; they argue
a surprisingly large number of moderate blacks might vote for Mr F. W. de
Klerk, the National Party NP leader and President.
'I have no doubt that when the real electoral process is in the offing . . .
there will be a moderate alliance in which the National Party will play an
important part which has more than an even chance to win an election,' Mr de
Klerk told the Financial Times in an interview (see page 6).
No such election is likely until 1993 or 1994, however, and much can happen
before this prediction is tested. For the moment, Pretoria knows it cannot
manage without the ANC. Indeed, senior Nationalists concede that a stable
future government would have to include all three major players: Inkatha,
the National Party, and the ANC.
Yet government appears to prefer a chastened ANC - perhaps on the principle
that it will prove a more realistic negotiating partner. The extraordinary
rapport which existed briefly last year between Afrikaner nationalists and
African nationalists has been put under serious strain by the violence;
senior ANC officials now say openly they do not trust Mr de Klerk.
'It's very hard to accept that this very able police force which purged
every form of resistance to the white man now cannot make arrests to stop
the killing,' says Mr Franklin Sonn, a prominent anti-apartheid politician.
Government rejects ANC allegations that a 'third force' among the police is
responsible for the fighting. It denies any intention to let violence
continue. 'The violence made the point that apartheid failed to make: that
the problem of ethnicity, black ethnicity, is real in South Africa,' one
senior Nationalist says somewhat ingenuously, given that apartheid aimed to
entrench ethnicity. He adds, however: 'It is just harming us now, it is
hurting business confidence and undermining support for a new constitution,
not to mention the human suffering . . .'
It is also undermining the authority of the 72-year-old Mr Mandela, who has
almost single-handedly coaxed the recalcitrant ANC to the negotiating table.
'Ninety per cent of our supporters think we've sold out,' says a leading
member of the ANC's national executive committee. Under these circumstances,
says Mr Zola Skweyiya, another ANC official, 'people can just go wild'.
Economic conditions, too, foster instability: with the economy in recession
and thousands joining jobless queues each week, conditions could hardly be
worse for negotiations.
Almost as a gesture of desperation, the ANC last month issued an ultimatum
to Pretoria on the violence: take steps to end it, or see the ANC boycott
talks on a new constitution. That ultimatum expires on Thursday and there
still seems a fair chance negotiations will indeed be suspended,
notwithstanding last week's initiative by Mr de Klerk, outlining a package
of security measures and offering main opposition parties seats in a broader
based cabinet. But neither side can afford a long interruption: lower-level
talks are likely to continue; and attempts to set up a forum for
constitutional talks should resume soon after the ANC elects new leaders at
its conference in June.
The pace of change could accelerate after those talks, which should
revitalise an ANC national executive dominated by elderly exiles with little
experience of modern South Africa. Younger men and women from trade unions
and civic organisations - veterans of shopfloor and local government
negotiations - are likely to be elected to an expanded national executive.
Sometime after that, the Multi-Party Conference (which must include Inkatha
as well as a wide range of other parties) will be convened to agree on a
mechanism to draw up a constitution - and, it is hoped, to agree basic
constitutional principles. Chances are that the conference will eventually
be transformed into a 'constituent assembly' - meeting the ANC's demand for
such a body, while assuaging the Nationalists' fear of domination.
The conference could also perform a consultative role: gradually, it would
share responsibility for government functions such as education and
security; the national budget would be drawn up with its advice. In short,
South Africa would have a form of interim government - another key demand
made by the ANC, but so far rejected by Pretoria.
The way would then be clear to agree a new constitution; common ground has
recently begun to emerge here as well. Both sides are committed to a system
of checks and balances involving an independent judiciary, a bill of rights,
and a bicameral legislature. Many differences remain: there is likely to be
a fierce battle over the NP's demand for proportional representation in the
executive, and for devolution of power to community level. But in the words
of one ANC negotiators: 'The constitution is the least of our problems.'
The process will be lengthy nonetheless, with South Africa's first
non-racial elections unlikely before the term of the current parliament
expires near the end of 1994. But whether or not the constitution demands
it, the new South Africa is likely to be ruled by coalition for years to
come: a ponderous and unwieldy form of government for a country whose
economic problems require urgent action; but its best hope for peace in the
post-apartheid era.

FT  07 MAY 91 / The FT Interview: Pillar in a world of instability - Manfred
Worner, the secretary-general of Nato, speaks to Robert Mauthner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manfred Worner, the 56-year-old Nato secretary-general, is a contented man.
After nearly three years in a job requiring more diplomatic than military
skills, he positively purrs with pleasure at the satisfaction derived from
running a 16-nation alliance in search of a new mission. 'I am fascinated by
it.'
Far from regretting the days when Nato had the straightforward and
well-defined task of defending the west against the aggressive designs of
one main adversary, the Soviet Union, Mr Worner finds 'the new challenges'
facing the alliance infinitely stimulating.
'When my friend and predecessor, Peter Carrington (Lord Carrington, the
former British foreign secretary), passed this job on to me, he said, 'Look,
after a few years you will be bored'.' A year later, when the Soviet Union
and eastern Europe were on the brink of far-reaching political changes, Lord
Carrington had changed his mind. 'If only I had known at the time, I would
have stayed on,' he told his successor.
In spite of the ending of the cold war, Mr Worner, who as German defence
minister in the 1980s was responsible for the controversial deployment of
Pershing and cruise missiles in his own country, has not entirely abandoned
his erstwhile hardline image. He has no doubt that Nato continues to fulfil
an essential defence role even after the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact.
'I think that developments during the last few months have really created a
broad consensus that this alliance will be badly needed in the future, of
course with changed tasks and with changed structures.' As justification for
this view, he offers two examples: the unpredictability of the Soviet Union,
given its unstable domestic political and economic situation, coupled with
the fact that it still boasts a 'huge military machine'; and the new risks
to western security underlined by the recent conflict in the Gulf.
'You see, the real world which we now see developing reflects a phase of
history which is primarily dominated by instability.' What is required in
such a state of flux is international organisations which can provide
stability, he says, warming to his favourite subject. Mr Worner may not be
able to claim he is the author of the concept of what he describes as
'interlocking institutions'. But it perfectly suits his purpose of
justifying Nato's continued existence by fitting it into a wider
international framework of complementary and partly overlapping
organisations. Apart from Nato, these include the 34-nation Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), the European Community, the
Western European Union, the Council of Europe and the United Nations.
Even as committed an enthusiast as Mr Worner has to admit implicitly that
Nato has serious limitations as a security organisation. How, for instance,
can one justify the exclusion from Nato of the fledgling democracies in
eastern Europe, which have broken off military ties with the Soviet Union,
when the organisation's stated objective is to create 'a Europe whole and
free?' Why was Nato not more directly involved in the Gulf conflict, given
that President Saddam Hussein's policies were widely perceived by alliance
members as a serious threat to western interests?
The spin the secretary-general puts on his replies to these questions is
evidence that he is not entirely happy with the situation. 'They (the
eastern Europeans) did not apply for membership,' he says. Strictly speaking
that is true, but the reason they did not apply was that it was made clear
to them that their applications would be turned down. President Vaclav Havel
of Czechoslovakia made it plain in his speech to the Nato Council in March
that his country wanted to become a member of the organisation. 'We believe
an alliance of countries united by the idea of freedom and democracy should
not be forever closed to neighbouring countries that are pursuing the same
goals,' Mr Havel said.
Yet Mr Worner has a cogent answer to all this. 'We seriously want to build a
new security structure which includes the Soviet Union. So what we try to
avoid is a counter-productive situation, in which you create not only the
impression, but the reality that the Soviet Union is excluded, isolated.
'If you extended the borders of Nato at this very moment to the borders of
the Soviet Union, that, I think, would overburden the Soviet leadership,
both the political and military.'
Where Mr Worner's concept starts to become somewhat confused is when he
talks about the relationship between all these 'interlocking institutions'.
He appears to want it both ways: some kind of all-European security
structure, while preserving Nato's identity and role.
He rules out a single European security super-institution. The idea that
both the Nato and former Warsaw Pact alliances could eventually merge within
the CSCE is considered unrealistic because 34 western and eastern nations
with very different interests could never reach a consensus. 'If a real
crisis or a threat, or even a war starts, then you need a solid security
guarantee, and that can only be given by an alliance like ours.'
Even as a convinced 'European', he also adamantly opposes the proposal, dear
to the French and to Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president,
that the EC should have its own independent defence policy.
'There should be no doubt that the (Atlantic) alliance is, and remains, a
primary alliance and location for the security of Europe. And that clearly
means that all decisions concerning the security of our European member
nations must be dealt with in this Atlantic alliance.
'Moreover, if we accept the notion of a European defence identity, it must
be done in a way which does not damage the transatlantic relationship,
because European security in the foreseeable future is not possible without
a military and political commitment of north America to the security of
Europe.'
Mr Worner nevertheless makes it clear that he strongly favours a 'European
pillar' within Nato and that the Western European Union would be an
appropriate institution to embody it. The proposal that WEU should act as a
bridge between the European Community and Nato appeals to him, as long as
its final decisions affecting western defence are always subject to the
higher authority and interests of the Atlantic Alliance.
Indeed, WEU is at least a partial answer to the other embarrassing dilemma
facing the alliance: what to do about 'out-of-area' crises, such as the
recent Gulf conflict, which are perceived to threaten western security, but
do not fall within the European region covered by the Nato treaty.
Mr Worner is in no doubt about the legal situation. Nato security guarantees
extend only to the limited geographical area specified in the treaty. 'Of
course, the treaty does not prohibit a Nato action out of area if all
nations agree.'
However, there is no such political consensus on this issue, he says. So
what will be the likely future developments on this front?
'I think, as the Gulf war has clearly proved. . . .you can handle such
contingencies on a case-by-case basis. Those nations which are prepared to
act, act. The others support them.' Nato as a whole could provide logistical
support and other assistance, as it did effectively during the Gulf war.
At this point, the WEU rabbit is pulled out of the helmet. Some European
units assigned to Nato could also be made available to WEU, and be used as a
rapid reaction force in out-of-area contingencies where Nato is legally
debarred from acting. This idea is gaining ground fast and is likely to be
explored further in Nato's strategic and military review, due to be
submitted to a Nato summit in the autumn.
Mr Worner does not say so in so many words, but it would save Nato's face.
For it can only survive effectively if it adapts its political and defence
strategy to tomorrow's crises and wars, rather than yesterday's.

FT  07 MAY 91 / France's man of the moment: Ian Davidson on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the French love a good anniversary, it is less for the warm pleasure of
recollection than for the fierce passion of reliving old battles. In 1989
the celebration of the bicentenary demonstrated that the revolution is still
not over, whatever the historians may say. Last year the centenary of the
birth of Charles de Gaulle showed that the founder of the Fifth Republic can
still provoke controversy from beyond the grave. This week, on Friday, we
have the 10th anniversary of Francois Mitterrand's first presidential
election victory; and much of the French political establishment is in a
froth about it, either to celebrate or to denounce this decade of socialist
government.
Now 10 years in power is a long time for one man, as Mrs Margaret Thatcher's
claque never ceased to remind us. But when it's over, it's over, and in the
meantime it is an unremarkable span when measured against the tides of
history. So it may seem disproportionate to speak of President Mitterrand's
decade in the same breath as the centenary of de Gaulle or the bicentenary
of the French Revolution. But there are two reasons why it may not be
far-fetched.
The first is that Mr Mitterrand has steadily grown in stature on the French
national stage, and it has now become quite normal in France to measure him
against de Gaulle. Indeed, a recent best-selling assessment of Mr Mitterrand
was explicitly constructed as a point-by-point comparison between him and de
Gaulle, and by no means always to Mr Mitterrand's disadvantage.
Moreover, it is a measure of Mr Mitterrand's charisma that the opposition
parties virtually never criticise him in person, an immunity which owes more
to his acquired authority than to the eminence of his presidential office.
Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the opposition Gaullist RPR party, may denounce
the socialists as 'evil-doers, incapable, immoral and intolerant', but he is
careful not to name Mr Mitterrand in his denunciation.
Mr Mitterrand's supporters would claim that he has already made a
contribution to French history which is, in its own way, every bit as
important as anything achieved by de Gaulle; and a contribution to European
history which is far greater; and they may be right on both counts.
After the humiliations of the Second World War, de Gaulle restored
self-confidence in the arrogant diplomacy of the nation-state; after the
switchbacks of the Fourth Republic, he restored belief in the reliability of
strong government. But the flaw in the Gaullist legacy is its anachronism:
having reached its apogee in the 19th century, the arrogance of the
nation-state is out of date in the modern world. Moreover, the kind of
strong government de Gaulle could deliver was too long on drama and too
short on democratic sensitivity; he seized power through a virtual coup, and
he was driven off by popular rejection.
For journalists, de Gaulle was a delight; the combination of an
international naughty boy, who was both a master of the theatrical coup and
a master of the French language, was irresistible. But it wouldn't do for
very long, and indeed it didn't.
Outwardly, Mr Mitterrand has continued to drape himself in the Gaullist
flag; he told the nation after the Gulf war that France had lived up to her
'rank' in the world. But his real attainments have been the exact opposite
of the ambitions of de Gaulle, and they are likely to prove more durable.
The first of these attainments is that he has presided over the conversion
of the French people, both to an acceptance of the market economy, and to
the overriding need for rigorous and stable economic management. Considering
his heritage, this is extraordinary; he came to power with a policy
combining Colbertism with socialism, and the mixture quickly proved lethal.
His conversion to a different economic rulebook has achieved a result which
eluded his conservative predecessors, including de Gaulle: the whole world
now believes in a strong and stable franc.
To make that other cross-reference, between Mr Mitterrand's 10 years in
power and the French Revolution, may seem contrived; and Mr Mitterrand
himself went through acrobatic contortions during the bicentenary
celebrations to sanitise the historical record, as if five years of chaos
and slaughter could be reduced to its immaculate prologue, the Declaration
of the Rights of Man. Yet there are points of contrast, like the abolition
of the death penalty in 1981, which are not irrelevant.
Moreover, on the European scene the comparison is striking and far-reaching.
The French Revolution led to the mobilisation of the nation in arms, for the
conquest of Europe and the invasion of Russia. But the Napoleonic model of
heroic action, which has lent such a frisson to national pride, is now in
the final stages of being comprehensively junked (despite the Gulf war), in
favour of an integrationist model which is civilian, law-based and
democratic.
Of course, this is not just Mr Mitterrand's doing: manifestly he is one of
the moving spirits in the current acceleration of the European Community,
but others had the idea before him, and others are vital to the process
today. But that's just the point: this is a new model, which is just as
revolutionary as the French Revolution, and a good deal more durable.
Europe's integration process has been going on for longer, more
consistently, and more constructively, than all the zig-zags, constitutions,
communes and dictatorships which lay between the fall of the Bastille and
the fall of Napoleon.
In that sense the Mitterrand decade is shorthand for a sweeping
transformation of the facts and assumptions of international life, such as
has rarely taken place in history. In 1981 we had martial law in Poland and
the Russians in Afghanistan; in 1991 we have the gradual implosion of the
Soviet empire and the negotiation of treaties on economic and political
union in western Europe.
Put it this way: if you had to identify the past decade with one person,
which are the other candidates? Would it be Reagan? Or Thatcher? Or
Gorbachev?

FT  07 MAY 91 / Japan deserves a little respect: Michael Prowse on America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
America's relationship with Japan is thoroughly unhealthy. Following the
Second World War, the US initially played the role of feudal lord, Japan
that of vassal. As Japan rebuilt its economy and society, the relationship
evolved into that of teacher and pupil. The next step should have been
mutual acceptance of equality. But this has not happened: the teacher
remains overbearing; the pupil, although now adult, unable politically to
assert itself.
The teacher has decidedly mixed feelings about its student's success. When
voting with its credit cards, it loves its precocious pupil: US streets and
homes are clogged with Japanese cars, videos and cameras. Yet tremendous
resentment lurks near the surface. A poll showing that three-quarters of
Americans think Japan did not pull its weight in the Gulf war was merely the
latest in a litany of complaints.
Many Americans believe Japan has prospered by cheating: by selling goods at
artificially low prices in export markets while curbing imports; and by
acquiescing in - if not actively encouraging - concentrations of industrial
power that contravene US anti-trust law. The rise of Japanese direct
investment in the US, although still well short of Britain's, also provokes
hostility. Japan is reviled both for 'buying up' America and for restricting
the career prospects of US employees.
The pupil's success is beyond doubt. Japan has consistently produced
macroeconomic results that are magical by US standards. Growth of real Gross
National Product has averaged more than 4 per cent a year since 1981. The
unemployment rate has never exceeded 3 per cent. Inflation has been held to
an average of only about 2 per cent. Since the mid-1980s, Japan has also
turned a moderate government deficit into a surplus and, as a share of GNP,
more than halved its once-troubling current account surplus. The economy is
now slowing, but the 'recession' will be mild by Anglo-Saxon standards.
Economics, however, is only part of the story. Japan is effortlessly
outperforming the US on a host of other criteria. Schoolchildren learn much
more, especially in numerate subjects. In maths, the average Japanese
student achieves a higher level than the top 5 per cent of US high school
seniors. Japan spends about half as much of GNP on health care as the US,
yet its people are much healthier. The infant mortality rate is half that of
the US; life expectancy several years longer. Japanese streets are clean and
safe.
Nor is Japan ignoring its global responsibilities. As the world's biggest
creditor nation, it is beginning to allocate funds more carefully. By
providing more than Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.3bn) a year in overseas
development assistance, it has displaced the US as the world's top donor
nation. The World Bank also recently cited Japan as an environmental
paragon: since 1970 it has cut sulphur dioxide emissions by 80 per cent
despite more than doubling its GNP. It has done more than any competitor
nation to improve energy efficiency and has much lower carbon emissions than
either the US or Europe.
Yet despite Japan's remarkable success in so many fields, Americans rarely
acknowledge that they have anything to learn from their former pupil. With
the possible exception of innovations in industrial organisation, the US
reaction is invariably that Japan has succeeded by 'bending the rules'. When
will the penny drop? When will the US grasp that it - rather than Japan -
needs to abandon bad habits and foolish theories?
Many of the virtues of modern Japan cannot be easily copied. The US with its
open spaces, waves of immigration and frontier spirit cannot hope to match a
social cohesiveness resulting from high population density and centuries of
isolation. Nor, saddled with a 'quick fix, no pain' television culture, can
it easily transplant austere Confucian values that persuade parents to
sacrifice almost anything for their children's education. But these Japanese
strengths at least illustrate the direction of the required changes.
The startling success of the Japanese economy - which can no longer be
dismissed as a 'catching up' phenomenon - raises a particular problem. In
his 1936 preface to the Japanese edition of The General Theory, John Maynard
Keynes speculated that the Japanese might 'neither require nor resist my
assaults against the English tradition'. He was referring, of course, to the
fact that 19th century classical economics never exerted much intellectual
pull on the pragmatic Japanese.
Scholars can argue about the causes of Japan's economic vitality. But, as
Keynes noted, it certainly does not reflect an unusual attention to free
market doctrines. The state plays a large, if often subtle, role in
influencing the distribution of resources. It regulates heavily, especially
in the financial sector. It champions producers' rather than consumers'
interests. In industry, goals like market share take precedence over
profits; pay formulas run directly counter to market principles, rewarding
seniority rather than performance. In many instances, groups are regarded as
more important than individuals. All this has led to a focus on investment,
manufacturing, foreign markets and long-term planning: notorious areas of
weakness in Anglo-Saxon economies.
Japan's economic and social record is not unblemished. But it is doing well
enough to deserve more respect from the US. Instead of getting angry about
'unfair' practices, the teacher should perhaps start listening to its gifted
pupil.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Money Markets: Rate uncertainties
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENCIES AND interest rates have entered an uncertain period, with the
dollar volatile and the US Federal Reserve cutting its discount rate last
week. The two events were not linked. The dollar was already retreating when
the Fed cut, but then rallied on Friday's US employment data.
A surge in demand for the dollar last Monday morning took it to a peak of
DM1.7825, following the failure of ministers from the Group of Seven to
agree on a co-ordinated rate cutting policy.
Expectations that the US economy will soon recover and the lack of an
interest rate agreement provided excuses to buy the currency.
Friday's better than expected employment data might be the first concrete
sign of recovery, while the lack of a G7 agreement on rates was quickly
shown to be no barrier to monetary easing by the Fed.
The Bank of Canada followed with a larger than expected cut of 16 basis
points to 9.33 per cent in its lending rate to the domestic banking system
and it appears that Japan may cut its discount rate in the near future. But
any moves in sympathy from Europe are likely to be severely restricted by
the German view.
The Bundesbank did not tighten credit policies at Thursday council meeting,
but it was made clear that consideration of lower rates was not on the
agenda.
France might like to cut rates, but is hampered while the French franc
remains at the bottom of the European exchange rate mechanism. Caution on
further cuts in UK bank base rates have been signalled several times by the
Bank of England recently. Last week's losses by the ruling Conservative
Party at local government elections are unlikely to produce any early change
of heart.

FT  07 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Taiwan hits 11-month
high after jail release
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DOMESTIC events encouraged both Taiwan and New Zealand yesterday, although
most Pacific Rim markets declined. Tokyo and Bangkok were shut.
TAIWAN rose to an 11-month high in active trading, encouraged by the release
from jail of Weng You-ming, chairman of Hualon Corp, after his detention for
more than a month on alleged involvement in a share scandal.
The weighted index, which advanced 67.83 on Saturday, climbed 191.31 or 3.2
per cent to 6,112.09, the best close since June 1990 and the first above
6,000 this year. Turnover rose to TDollars 91bn from TDollars 51bn.
NEW ZEALAND welcomed the news of a further reduction in debt at Brierley
Investments. The Barclays index gained 25.39 or 1.7 per cent to 1,553.22 in
active turnover of NZDollars 22m, down from NZDollars 33m.
Brierley jumped 10 cents to NZDollars 1.20 after saying that it had sold 30
per cent of Mount Charlotte, the UK hotel chain.
AUSTRALIA edged higher on foreign buying of blue chips such as MIM Holdings,
up 7 cents at ADollars 1.70, and BHP, 30 cents higher at ADollars 12.35. The
All Ordinaries index gained 4.6 to 1,522.4 in modest turnover of ADollars
187m, up from ADollars 159m.
Coles Myer fell 20 cents to ADollars 10.50 after sales figures.
HONG KONG was depressed by Friday's issue of a second batch of warrants on
two blue chips controlled by billionaire Li Ka-Shing. The Hang Seng index
dropped 33.45 to 3,704.43 in turnover of HKDollars 1.46bn, down from
HKDollars 1.82bn.
Cheung Kong dropped 50 cents to HKDollars 18 in response to the warrant
issue, which was interpreted as a sign that that Li might be seeking ways to
cash out of the market.
SEOUL fell for the third day on political concerns. The composite index lost
4.88 to 640.62, in slow turnover of Won111bn, down from Won118bn.
SINGAPORE fell, the Straits Times Industrial index tumbling 27.15 or 1.8 per
cent to 1,518.80 as volume eased to SDollars 105m from SDollars 118m. KUALA
LUMPUR also declined in light trading. The composite index lost 8.58 to
579.51.

FT  07 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets: Superleague threatens to flatten second
tier - The possible consequences of a trend towards passive investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TREND towards passive investment combined with a boom in new equity issues
in the 1990s could make it more difficult for some companies to raise fresh
capital, a recent report warns.
The report*, by Mr Michael Howell of Salomon Brothers, predicts that
aggregate gross equity issues worldwide could spiral to Dollars 375bn
(Pounds 221bn) by 1995 - equivalent to 3.5 per cent of current world equity
market capitalisation - from Dollars 194.7bn (Pounds 115bn) or 1.8 per cent
estimated for 1990.
Prospective issues from US companies - many of which need to reduce their
gearing - could represent up to 28 per cent of this total.
About half of the global new issues are expected to be bought by foreign
investors, and nearly a third by so-called passive investors - in other
words, investors whose portfolios reflect a stock market index. The
remaining 18 per cent would probably be bought by active domestic investors.
Investors such as life insurance and pension funds place considerable
emphasis on risk management. There are two main ways to manage risk - by
using derivative instruments and by diversifying the portfolio to include a
broad range of domestic and foreign equities.
Many large investors use derivatives such as index futures to hedge risks.
These have the advantage of being cheaper and more liquid: for example,
index futures represent a more convenient and liquid way of trading an index
basket than if the investor were to buy the underlying securities.
Mr Howell points out that a truly global fund would only need to hold around
1,000 major international stocks in a virtually passive portfolio, making
only a few transactions in the cash equity market in order to rebalance the
portfolio in line with adjustments to the main indices.
As more investors shift towards a passive investment strategy, this could
result in the formation of a two-tier capital market, according to Mr
Howell. The upper tier would consist of the 'thundering thousand'
superleague of global stocks, while the lower tier would include smaller,
non-index stocks.
'The problem of a two-tier capital market could be serious, because those
companies that may need fresh equity the most are also likely to have
already been shunned by stock market investors to such an extent that the
cost of equity raising is already high,' says Mr Howell.
In the past, companies have tended to chase investors' funds, seeking
listings in those markets where they believe it will be easy to raise money.
However, in the future, as more and more investors aim to reduce risk by
holding portfolios which reflect the composition of stock market indices,
the shoe will be on the other foot: investors will have to seek those
companies which are included in the index.
'A passive or quasi-passive fund will unconsciously take up a rights issue
from an index constituent simply to maintain a balanced index weighting,'
says Mr Howell.
Similarly, as multinationals decide to unbundle in the future, they may
consider floating off significant business areas, for example in Japan or in
Europe. If these separately listed companies are large enough to be included
in a market index, passive investors will have to buy the shares in order to
adjust their portfolios to the index.

FT  07 MAY 91 / South African Bonds: Reform sparks interest among investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR F. W. DE KLERK, the South African president, appeared to gain few
concessions from the dozen top bankers he met in London last month. However,
the gradual reform of South African society is rekindling interest among
international investors in the country's bond markets.
At present, buying remains limited and confined mainly to retail investors
looking for high-yielding assets. 'We saw a lot of financial institutions
taking positions in the market in the early 1980s but now interest is mostly
confined to retail client and retail trusts,' said Ms Marilyn Visser, head
of gilt sales at Simpson McKie stockbrokers in Johannesburg.
But, expressions of interest were sufficient for Credit Suisse to include a
selection of rand-denominated bonds on its list of recommended bonds for the
first time last week.
Many of the investors committing funds to the South African market are
betting on a convergence of the financial rand (in which international
financial flows are transacted) and the commercial rand. The financial rand
was re-introduced in 1986 precisely to attract overseas capital into the
domestic economy.
Overseas investors buy government bonds at the financial rand exchange rate,
but coupon payments are paid at the commercial rate. The 20 per cent
discount of financial rand (currently at around R3.35 against the dollar)
against the commercial rand (currently at R2.78) has the effect of boosting
yields.
For example, Republic of South Africa bond issue No. 153 maturing 2010,
currently yields 15.65 per cent to a South African resident, but 18.8 per
cent to a non-resident. With inflation running at about 14 per cent, real
yields would not be attractive but for this dual exchange rate.
Moreover, if the financial rand continues to appreciate, international
investors make a healthy capital gain. The differential between the two
currencies was as high as 50 per cent in late 1986 but closed in the last
year as foreign investment began to return to South Africa.
The government expects the differential to continue to narrow and hopes to
abolish the financial rand within three to five years.
But this narrowing of the dual exchange rates may not necessarily come in a
direction which benefits overseas investors. Rather than a further
appreciation of the financial rand, some analysts are expecting a
depreciation of the commercial rand.
'High inflation, the pursuit of growth and a weaker gold price will cause
the commercial rand to fall towards the financial rand exchange rate,'
argues Mr Richard Grey, bond market analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in
London. 'While the nature of political risk has changed in South Africa, the
economic risks are still substantial.'
The gold price is important to the exchange rate because the commodity
accounts for almost half of South Africa's annual R42bn exports.
These underlying risks have held back recent market performance. After an
encouraging start to the year, prices have fallen as inflationary pressures
in the economy have re-emerged and the political outlook has deteriorated.

FT  07 MAY 91 / UK Gilts: Inflation and funding cause concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'ONE down, two to go' could well serve as the motto for the gilts market at
the moment.
One worry which the market has put out of its mind concerns a general
election. After the Conservative Party's limp performance in Thursday's
local elections, the market does not expect a general election until autumn
at the earliest. So, after spending much of last week fretting about the
outcome of the local elections, the market was firm on Friday and could well
see a bounce this week.
That leaves two other concerns on which to focus: inflation and funding.
May 17 sees the publication of the retail price index for April. The market
expects to see a sharp fall in the RPI to 6.1 or 6.2 per cent. It also
expects this to trigger another base rate cut, particularly if the
unemployment figures, due out that week, show a sharp rise in the number of
jobless. In fact the market has already discounted a base rate cut. But,
even if the RPI figures are favourable, there is still some uncertainty in
the market as to whether underlying inflation is coming down.
The other matter currently niggling the market concerns funding. While the
Bank of England was delighted with the success of its recent gilts auction,
the market is well aware there is still some Pounds 800m of tap stock (the
Treasury 9 per cent due 2008) waiting to be taken up. The tap price was set
at 94 1/4 while the existing stock has recently traded at around 92 9/16 .
Thus the market is eager to know what the Bank of England plans to do next.
'Will the Bank consider cutting the tap price?' is one question the market
wants answered. The Bank has cut tap prices before, so such a move would not
be unprecedented, though usually the Bank cuts the price only if it feels
the market has drifted away from the tap price and is unlikely to bounce
back. It would need to feel pretty certain the market had 'bottomed out' or
it could find that having cut the tap price, the market simply slipped away
again. However, if the market bounces high enough now the local elections
are passed, it is conceivable the Bank will get away without having to cut
the price at all.
Given that the government will need to sell a substantial volume of gilts in
order to fund the PSBR (which economists expect will be about Pounds 12bn),
there is some pressure on the Bank of England to push ahead with its funding
programme. The market is keen to know 'how, when and what' the Bank of
England will sell.
The Bank has stated it may hold a total of three or four gilt auctions in
the 1991/92 fiscal year in addition to gilt taps. However, it claims to have
no set calendar for issuance.
The assumption in the market is that stock sales will be spread as evenly as
possible throughout the year, but few clues have been given as to which
maturities the Bank might favour. So far, the Bank has chosen to issue
further tranches of existing stock with the intention of improving their
liquidity. This is exactly what the market wants - namely more of the same.
Mr John Shepperd, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, thinks the Bank
should take the opportunity to improve the liquidity of five and 10-year
stocks. Mr John Kendall, economist at Barings, believes there is a strong
demand for gilts of up to five years' maturity, both for short-dated
liquidity instruments and the swaps market.
Also included on the list of desirable issues are: the Treasury stock 10 per
cent due 2001, of which there is already about Pounds 2.4bn in existence,
but which some would like to see built up as a strong 10-year benchmark
gilt; and more of an existing index-linked gilt, preferably one with a
maturity of more than 10 years.
Traditionally the long end of the yield curve has been left vacant for
corporate issuers. But those in the non-gilt sterling market say the lack of
suitable longer-dated gilts means even very long-dated corporate bonds, of
20-year maturity and above, have to be priced off gilts, such as the
Treasury 9 per cent due 2008.

FT  07 MAY 91 / International Bonds: Companies reappear from the long, dark
winter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING a long, dark winter in which corporations were notable by their
absence from the international bond market, a steady stream of companies,
many of them British, has recently re-emerged with public bond issues.
UK companies including Sainsbury, Sears, British Petroleum, British
Aerospace, British Gas, Guinness, National Westminster Bank and Barclays
Bank have issued straight debt securities in the international bond market
in recent weeks. These deals, and others by overseas companies such as
Daimler Benz and Electrolux, have broken a spell in which the domination of
the bond market by sovereign-backed and supranational institutions was
almost complete.
In part, the absence of companies has been a pragmatic response to market
conditions. As the UK, US and other economies swung into recession,
international investors became wary of buying paper issued by companies. The
corporate sector was seen as over-geared and vulnerable to a downturn.
This paranoia concerning credit quality was reflected in a dramatic widening
of yield spreads in all markets during the second half of last year.
In the US market, for example, JP Morgan's index of bonds issued by
industrial companies of Baa credit quality, around medium grade, shows yield
spreads over US Treasury stock widening from 184 basis points in September
to 266 basis points in December.
However, such indexed figures disguise the fact that some sectors of the
economy were hit harder than others. In the face of mounting loan losses,
the banking industry was particularly hard hit.
An extreme example is Standard Chartered, which saw the yield spread on its
12 7/8 per cent sterling bond issue maturing 2002/07 swing out from 250
basis points in September to 700 basis points in January.
In this hostile environment, it was only the best quality credits that could
raise finance at anything other than punitive rates. In addition, private
sector companies with high capital requirements - such as utilities - have
been able to channel their borrowing through supranational institutions,
such as the European Investment Bank and the European Community.
The EIB can issue long-date sterling bonds at a yield spread of perhaps 60
basis points over UK government bonds in the international market. In
contrast, Anglian Water's Pounds 100m long-date Eurobond issue was launched
in December at a spread of 150 basis points over gilts.
Most EIB loans fall under the broad objective of regional development,
although the bank will also finance environmental protection projects,
investment in high technology and communications - as well as granting
special loans to small and medium-size enterprises. The banks' capital,
subscribed by EC governments was doubled to Ecu57.6bn last year. This raises
the ceiling of loans which the EIB can make to Ecu144bn, against outstanding
loans of Ecu61.5bn. Hence the EIB expects to lend around Ecu80bn between now
and 1995.
In the first quarter, the EIB extended loans totalling Ecu460m (Pounds 380m)
to UK companies. One recipient was Southern Water, which signed a Pounds 55m
loan facility with the EIB, adding to a Pounds 40m loan made last year. The
15-year facility carries a preferential interest rate fixed at around 11 per
cent.
Another potential source of finance is the EC, which lends to the private
sector through the European Coal and Steel Community. Again, projects must
meet lending criteria: job creation in areas hit by the fall of the coal and
steel industries.
In addition to direct loans, the ECSC provides lines of credit to banks
through its global loans scheme. UK banks which participate in the scheme
include Barclays, National Westminster, Midland, Bank of Scotland, TSB and
Clydesdale. Each line of credit is up to Pounds 90m, which is drawn down as
sub-loans to individual projects (up to Pounds 5.4m) are approved.
Among UK companies, Tesco and Argyll stores groups were recently granted
direct loans totalling Pounds 87m by the ECSC.
The ECSC notes a sharp increase in loans made to companies this year. In the
first quarter, Ecu145m of loans were granted to the UK corporate sector,
against Ecu300m for the whole of last year. But, the EIB and ECSC will only
meet up to 50 per cent of the cost of any project. Additional finance must
come from either the banks or the capital market. Neither institution is
keen to be seen as a lender of last resort.
A further explanation for the absence of UK companies from the market is
that demand for finance has been low on cyclical grounds. This is a view
backed up by evidence from outside the bond markets. For example, in March
the growth in UK bank lending stood at a 15-year low. Yet in surveys only 4
per cent of UK companies complain of difficulties in raising external
finance.
The highly-geared corporate sector has concentrated on equity and
equity-linked funding (in the form of convertible bond issues) rather than
debt finance. Hence the bond market and syndicated loans market have been
largely deserted by UK companies. The test will come when demand for debt
finance revives as economic activity picks up.
The success of recent bond issues is encouraging. Corporate yield spreads
have already passed their peak, a sign investors are more willing to buy
paper issued by companies.
JP Morgan's index of Baa-rated industrial bonds now shows a yield spread of
200 basis points over Treasuries. The yield spread on Standard Chartered's
long-dated sterling paper has fallen to 300 basis points - back to the
levels of the third quarter of last year.
Greece has mandated Credit Suisse First Boston to lead manage its first
Ecu-denominated Eurobond issue. Other banks participating in the deal are
Dresdner Bank and Morgan Stanley Nomura International.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Syndicated Loans: Turkish borrowers regain confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKISH borrowers have returned to the syndicated loans market now that the
Gulf war is over and Turkey is no longer considered an unacceptable risk.
Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri - known as Tupras - is close to completing
arrangements for a Dollars 100m one-year import financing facility to cover
oil imports from Saudi Arabia, China, the Soviet Union, Abu Dhabi and
Algeria.
Sumitomo Bank, the agent, claims that participating banks have subscribed
Dollars 160m and will consequently have to be scaled back.
The fact that pricings are much higher now than they were before the Gulf
war has not deterred Turkish borrowers, most of whom were unable to tap the
syndicated loans market during the Middle East conflict.
For the Tupras deal, the margin over the London interbank offered rate is 65
basis points, and the participation fees range from 20 basis points for
Dollars 10m to 10 basis points for Dollars 1m.
Sumitomo arranged a similar Dollars 100m financing for Tupras last year but
 -as an indication of how prices have soared in the intervening period - the
margin over Libor then was 37.5 basis points and the top participation fee
was 10 basis points.
The credit facility has been underwritten by Sumitomo Bank, Banque Indosuez
and Girozentrale Vienna.
Interestingly, about a quarter of the financing has come from Japanese banks
(regional banks and smaller city banks).
Many Japanese banks have stayed away from the syndicated loans market in
recent months as they are concerned about their ability to meet the Basle
international capital adequacy requirements. However, the fact that the
Tupras deal is guaranteed by the Turkish government means that it carries a
zero weighting for capital adequacy under BIS proposals and hence is more
attractive.
The Tupras deal comes hot on the heels of a one-year Dollars 100m facility
for Turkiye Is Bankasi, Turkey's largest privately-owned commercial bank,
through Chase Investment Bank.
Ram dis Ticaret, Turkey's leading trading house, is also borrowing in the
syndicated loans market through Manufacturers Hanover, although terms have
not been disclosed.
Bankers expect other Turkish corporations to return to the syndicated loan
market soon and to extend the length of their loans.
Those Turkish borrowers that have returned to the market so far have tapped
the short end of the market and arranged one-year loans.
At the moment, many banks are pulling back from the long end of the
syndicated loan market in general, preferring five-year loans to seven-year
loans for example.
However, bankers expect Turkish corporations to gradually start borrowing
medium-term again as they did in the days before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
The Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe has arranged a Dollars 75m
trade facility through ANZ Merchant Bank, Standard Chartered, Barclays,
Credit Suisse and Union Bank of Switzerland. The interest margin over Libor
is 87.5 basis points while the maximum front-end fee is 60 basis points and
the commitment fee on the undrawn balance is 50 basis points.
The facility is intended to cover the import of machinery and spare parts.
Zimbabwe's mining sector has been hampered by a shortage of foreign
exchange.

FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: SocGen to take Lodestar stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale, the French private sector bank, is planning to make a
debut in the US mergers and acquisitions market by taking a minority stake
in Lodestar, a Wall Street takeover specialist.
The deal, for an undisclosed sum, brings SocGen alongside Yamaichi
Securities, one of the four big Japanese securities houses, which took a 20
per cent stake in Lodestar's M&amp;A advisory business on the US group's
formation two years ago.
It comes after a year in which French companies have made several large US
acquisitions, such as glass-maker Saint-Gobain's purchase of Norton, the
industrial abrasives group, the hotel company Accor's takeover of Motel 6, a
chain of cut-price hotels and the takeover of Edgcomb, the steel merchant,
by Usinor Sacilor.
SocGen will buy an undisclosed amount of shares both from Yamaichi and from
Lodestar's partners, who own the remaining 80 per cent of the equity. There
would be no issue of new capital, the French bank said. The US Federal
Reserve Board's approval is needed.
Lodestar and SocGen aim to combine forces to find purchasers for companies
for sale in their respective territories, though their M&amp;A teams, which are
of similar size, will remain separate.
Lodestar's 20 M&amp;A specialists advised on Dollars 2.8bn of acquisitions last
year. SocGen's 22 specialists in Paris, London and Frankfurt, advised on
FFr4.7bn (Dollars 796m) worth of deals involving French companies last year,
according to PF Publications, the French mergers magazine.
Lodestar, one of the growing number of Wall Street investment banking and
takeover specialists, was formed by Mr Ken Miller, former head of M&amp;A at
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Mr Tull Gearreald, former managing
director of corporate finance. They later attracted Mr Robert Baldwin,
former chairman and president of Morgan Stanley, to come in as partner and
chairman.

profits plunge

<TEXT>
PARENT company net profits at Cir, the main industrial holding group
controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian industrialist, crashed to
just L19.5bn (Dollars 15m) last year from L144.9bn in 1989.
The company, which is the main shareholder in the Olivetti computers and
office equipment group, is slashing its dividend. Payouts for ordinary,
savings and non-convertible savings shares will be cut from L130, L150 and
L170 to L50, L70 and L90 respectively.
The downturn in earnings is broadly in line with the forecast made last
February, when Cerus, Mr De Benedetti's main French holding company, finally
sold its remaining 9.9 per cent stake in Societe Generale de Belgique at a
FFr1.2bn (Dollars 203.3m) loss.
The profits fall follows Cir's decision to absorb the full effect of the La
Generale sale on its 1990 accounts, it said yesterday.
The company said that net earnings at group level, which have not yet been
officially revealed, would be around L70bn.
This is in line with the L60-80bn forecast made in February.
Group net profits were L181.4bn in 1989 while consolidated group debt rose
to L970bn last year from L778bn in 1989.
However, Cir said that the sale of its remaining La Generale stake had
resulted in a subsequent decrease in debt to L250bn.

FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: HBG agrees deal with Volker
Stevin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLLANDSCHE Beton Groep, the Netherlands' largest construction group, has
agreed to sell its majority stake in Volker Stevin, the country's second
largest builder, in return for acquiring Volker Stevin's dredging
activities, writes Ronald van de Krol.
The planned transaction will end a long-standing impasse between the two
companies sparked by HBG's unsuccessful attempt to take over Volker Stevin
against its will in the late 1980s.
The deal will also create a strong, internationally active dredging company
with annual turnover of nearly Fl 500m (Dollars 255m).
HBG intends a gradual reduction in its stake of 60 per cent in Volker
Stevin, by disposing of most of its shares through a banking syndicate led
by Credit Suisse First Boston and Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson, the Dutch
merchant bank. However, it will retain an unspecified minority stake in
Volker Stevin, which in turn intends to acquire a minority holding in HBG in
order to cement the two companies' new, more friendly relations.
Volker Stevin's dredging operations have an annual turnover of around Fl
230m, slightly less than HBG's dredging turnover of Fl 243m.
HBG will pay for the dredging operations mainly in cash but also partly in
Volker Stevin shares. Volker Stevin said it would then cancel these shares.

FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: Occidental to spin off gas
liquids business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OCCIDENTAL Petroleum is spinning off its US natural gas liquids business
into a joint venture in a Dollars 700m deal that represents its first
significant asset disposal under a plan to cut group debt by Dollars 3bn.
The gas business will be acquired by Trident Energy, a 50/50 joint venture
between Occidental and Hicks, Muse, a Dallas-based investment firm which
specialises in leveraged deals and restructurings.
Last January, shortly after the death of Dr Armand Hammer, Occidental's
chairman, the company announced plans to restructure, including a Dollars
3bn sale of assets.
Trident Energy will pay Dollars 691m in cash for the gas liquids business
and assume Dollars 9m of debt. Both Occidental and Hicks, Muse will invest
up to Dollars 100m in the equity of the new venture and the remainder of the
purchase price will be in the form of debt - which will be non-recourse and
off the balance sheets of both parent companies.
Mr Ray Irani, Occidental's new chairman, said this, together with Dollars
68m of minor asset sales already announced, brought to Dollars 500m the net
proceeds of the debt reduction programme. 'The transaction allows us to take
a significant amount of cash out of the natural gas liquids business while
retaining a 50 per cent ownership position,' he added.
Trident will enter a long-term contract to supply about 30 per cent of its
annual liquid feedstocks output to Occidental's chemicals business. The deal
does not include certain Occidental natural gas liquid assets which it says
are critical to its exploration and production operations.
An Occident spokesman said the group was on target to reach its goal of
Dollars 1.5bn of asset sales by the end of this year.

THE slow-down in inter-national travel drove Four Seasons Hotels, the
Toronto-based chain which operates some of the world's most expensive
hotels, into a first-quarter loss, writes Bernard Simon.
Four Seasons blamed the CDollars 4.1m (USDollars 3.56m) loss, equal to 19
cents a share, on a 'dramatic downturn' in bookings. The company's
properties include London's Inn on the Park.
Earnings in the first quarter of 1990 were CDollars 1.7m. Revenues dipped to
CDollars 139.6m from CDollars 143.4m. Operating losses from the group's
hotels rose to CDollars 8.8m from CDollars 1.4m.

<TEXT>
NET PROFIT at Wagons-Lits, the Franco-Belgian tourism group, fell by more
than 60 per cent last year, hit by increased debt and continuing
difficulties with Europcar, its British car-hire subsidiary, writes Andrew
Hill in Brussels.
The group's net profits tumbled from BFr1.46bn (Dollars 40.7m) to BFr547m in
1990, the second successive year in which profits have declined. In 1988 the
group made BFr2.68bn after tax. Operating profit also dropped last year,
from BFr3.1bn to BFr2.49bn, although turnover rose slightly to BFr98.9bn,
compared with BFr96.4bn. The company is proposing to cut its dividend from
BFr129 to BFr100 a share.
The results were also hit by an increase in the debt linked to Wagons-Lits'
stake in Sodexho, the French catering group, which was sold earlier this
year, and reduced margins in the original railway sleeping and dining-car
operations.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOLDERBANK, the Swiss cement group, plans an increase in share capital after
posting a 27.6 per cent decline in net consolidated earnings to SFr311m
(Dollars 210m) in 1990. Group turnover rose 5.5 per cent to SFr5.25bn.
Holderbank Financiere Glaris, the parent company, reported a 5.1 per cent
advance to SFr78.9m in 1990 net profit and the board proposes to pay
unchanged dividends of SFr125 per bearer share, SFr25 per registered share
and SFr12.50 per participation certificate.
Shareholders will be offered a rights issue as part of an increase from
SFr231m to SFr280m in the nominal share capital. In a first tranche 46,200
bearer shares with a par value of SFr500 will be offered at a price of
SFr2,500, almost exactly half the price at which the bearer shares traded in
Zurich before the announcement. The allocation will be 1 for 10 for bearer
shares, 1 for 50 for registered shares and 1 for 100 for participation
certificates.
The board will also seek authority to issue at its own discretion a further
51,800 bearer shares without rights attached, of which a limited number
would be earmarked for employees.
The declines in group net profit and cash-flow, down by 8.6 per cent to
SFr869m, in 1990 are steeper than those forecast by Mr Thomas Schmidheiny,
the chairman and managing director, in November.
Negative currency movements reduced group turnover by SFr428m,
newly-acquired companies added SFr410m while internal growth contributed
SFr290m.
Weak construction markets in North America and South Africa, low profit
margins in some newly-acquired companies and unfavourable currency movements
are given as the main reasons for the setback in earnings. In addition,
Holderbank maintained a high level of capital spending.
Investments in property, plant and equipment grew by 13 per cent to SFr641m.

FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: Devenish makes hostile attack on
Boddington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J A DEVENISH, the brewery and public house group, has launched a vigorous
assault on Boddington as part of its defence to the Pounds 122.3m hostile
offer from the public house, hotels and healthcare group.
The Devenish document criticises Boddington for its 'misconceived strategy
of diversification' into nursing homes, hotels and restaurants and accuses
it of being 'slow to invest in its own pub division.'
Devenish is sending a letter to Boddington shareholders suggesting seven
questions that they should ask the board at the predator's extraordinary
meeting in Manchester on Friday.
Meanwhile, the document does not include a profits forecast, but says that
between 1986 and 1990 operating profits per Devenish's managed pubs
increased by 70 per cent. It also values Devenish's fully diluted net assets
per share, as of September 30, at 272p, a premium to the Boddington offer
price.
On the subject of its brewery, Devenish says 'management has continued to be
dissatisfied with the returns generated by our brewing business. Firm action
is being taken to resolve this situation and we are actively working to
achieve a solution on a financial basis satisfactory to Devenish.'
The document shows that the directors of Devenish are employed on four year
rolling contracts.
Boddington's offer is 10 of its shares for every seven in Devenish; on the
basis of Friday night's closing Boddington price of 156p, that values each
Devenish share at 223p. There is also a cash alternative of 210p per share.
Boddington is also offering 1,096 of its shares for every 1,000 convertible
preference shares in Devenish, valuing each convertible share at 171p.

FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: Norton starts internal inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROFITS of a German fasteners company bought by Norton Group, better
known for its motorcycle business, have been paid into court because of an
ownership dispute.
The new management of Norton has launched an internal investigation into
both the German company and a US subsidiary called Pro-Fit, a distributor of
pipe fittings bought in 1988.
Both were acquired as profitable businesses to support the development of
the motorcycles and rotary engines.
Mr Norman Wilson, a new non-executive director of Norton, said the inquiry
was particularly concerned with the Pounds 8.2m German purchase. He
described the situation as a mess.
Earnings were being paid into court and Norton did not even know what it
owned because of the dispute, which was mentioned in the acquisition
document.
The results of the internal inquiry would be handed over to the Department
of Trade and Industry, which launched an investigation into Norton's affairs
in January.
At that time a poorly supported Pounds 6.5m rights issue, related to the FUS
Beteiligungs-und Verwaltungs acquisition, was struggling to a conclusion.
Although shareholders approved the FUS purchase in November, some dissidents
tried to block it.
Part of the controversy was that the vendor of the business was a Channel
Islands trust company set up to benefit the offspring of Mr James Tildesley,
Norton's chairman, who resigned about 10 days ago.
Norton's shares were suspended at 18p on April 1 because of a delay in
publishing its results for the six months to October 31. Mr Wilson said
Pounds 6m was owed to Midland Bank, which was being co-operative.

shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Etam, the 250-store women's fashion chain, will today decide
whether to accept a tender offer for shares which could lead to a bid
valuing the group at about Pounds 120m.
The offer of up to 185p per share has been made by Oceana Investment
Corporation, a vehicle for the Lewis family which runs the 700-store
Foschini chain in South Africa. Oceana already owns a 6.6 per cent stake and
could take that to 25.1 per cent.
Mr Michael Lewis, a director of Oceana and Foschini, said his organisation
was considering making an offer for the whole group, but wanted to gauge
shareholder opinion at the maximum price of 185p.
The offer is for up to 12.1m shares, 18.5 per cent of the equity, and the
outcome depends on the number of shares tendered. At less than 3.2m, the
offer will be withdrawn; between 3.2m and 12.1m, the shares will be bought
at 185p.
Oversubscription will lead to a striking price: shares tendered below it
will be bought at that price; tenders at the striking level will be scaled
back and those above it will be rejected. Oceana would use this response to
put pressure on the Etam board to come to an agreement.
Some analysts have recommended that shareholders tender because they believe
it will take at least two years for the shares to reach 185p on
fundamentals. The offer price compares with 87p in January and 176p on
Friday, and is 25 times the earnings recently announced for 1990-91.
Gartmore Investment Management, the largest institutional holder, increased
its stake from 11.1 to 12.3 per cent on Friday and is unlikely to tender. Mr
Vivian Balzalgette, a director, said: 'Oceana has highlighted the investment
potential.'

for rights failure
</HEADLINE>

   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FLOOD of rights issues from property companies has been blamed by
Bellway, the Tyneside-based housebuilder, for the disappointing response
from shareholders to its own cash call.
The shares were offered last month at 220p on a 5-for-11 basis. But there
was only 52.3 per cent take-up.
Charterhouse Bank placed the rest of the 11.6m shares with institutions at a
slight premium.
The company said it was disappointing that so many shareholders had decided
not to take up their rights.
Construction and property groups, including Higgs and Hill, Costain and
Berkeley, have called for more than Pounds 700m in 11 rights issues.
Mr Alan Robson, finance director, said: 'We have been tarred with the same
brush of other property companies tapping the equity market to reduce their
debt. Unlike many property companies we had no gearing and did not need to
raise the cash.'
Last month Bellway announced pre-tax profits for the six months to January
1991 of Pounds 3.36m (Pounds 6.11m). For the full year it is forecasting
Pounds 8.75m.

COATS VIYELLA, the textiles group engaged in a Pounds 252m hostile bid for
Tootal, is raising over Pounds 40m from the disposal of its stake in two
overseas manufacturers.
It is selling its 80 per cent interest in Consoltex, a North American

A CDollars 33 per share public offer for Consoltex, valuing the company at
CDollars 98m, has been made by a group of international investors led by Les
Gantiers of Jersey.
In addition, Coats has sold its 50 per cent stake in Gelvenor Textiles, a
South African manufacturer, to Avtex Holdings, the textile group of
Anglovaal Industries. Avtex already holds a half share in the company and is
paying Pounds 3.6m for full control.
Coats also announced that it is to close its thread manufacturing activities
in Ochsenburg, Austria. Production will be transfered to sites in Italy and
Portugal, bringing a benefit of Pounds 2m in a full financial year and a
one-off Pounds 2.5m from asset sales this year.

FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: Microvitec fails to make inroads
into Logitek
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE HOSTILE bid by Microvitec, the USM-quoted computer peripherals
manufacturer, for Logitek, which provides computer services, reached a
temporary deadlock after Microvitec failed to increase substantially its
stake despite a second extension of its offer deadline.
Microvitec announced that it bought Logitek shares on the market at 17 1/2 p
on Thursday, bringing its stake to 21.12 per cent. The deadline is May 9.
After issuing a defence document in early April, Logitek has made no further
comment on either the bid or its results for the year to end-March. It
warned earlier that profits would be affected by difficult conditions in the
second half.
Over the weekend, it passed its last opportunity - the 39th day after the
official offer was made - to make a new statement on its financial position
in response to the offer.
Mr James Bailey, chairman of Microvitec, said the refusal of Logitek to make
a statement regarding its results, was a 'poor show' for its institutional
shareholders who have been waiting for such a statement on which to base
their decision.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Granada seeking to raise Pounds 350m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRANADA Group, the UK television, leisure and computer services group, is
poised to make disposals and launch a rights issue, which together could
raise up to Pounds 350m. The group wants to bolster its balance sheet ahead
of its bid to retain the commercial television franchise in the north-west.
Bass, the UK brewer which recently announced a Pounds 558m rights issue, is
front-runner to buy the bingo business which comprises more than 80 venues
and could be worth Pounds 150m. Other disposals, for example of overseas
television rental activities, might bring the total sale proceeds to more
than Pounds 200m.
But with borrowings likely to have risen from the Pounds 436m disclosed last
September, representing debt-equity gearing of 86 per cent, a rights issue
is needed to ease the balance sheet strain further. If about Pounds 150m
were raised, gearing could come down to less than 20 per cent - leaving
aside nearly Pounds 150m in off-balance-sheet guarantees and loans to BSkyB,
the satellite television venture.
The expected rights issue has put the position of Mr Derek Lewis, Granada's
chief executive, under threat. He has been told that some institutional
shareholders and the group's merchant bank, SG Warburg, believe a top-level
change is needed.
Mr Lewis has been criticised for the group's Pounds 200m diversification
into computer services.
Granada's problems have come at a difficult time because it must submit its
bid to retain its north-west commercial television licence on May 15.
At Friday's close of 203.5p, its market value was Pounds 612.8m.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Economics Notebook: Spain prepares for an end to innocence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S chronic attachment to high real interest rates is beginning to eat
away at the country's equanimity.
It is under fire from France, which wants to cut its rates but cannot
without breaking out of its European Monetary System limits against the
peseta. Meanwhile, the Spanish Treasury is trying to cut the cost of medium
and long-term debt, but cannot lower yields as much as it wants to.
Finally, in a supposed bid to inject more competition into the inefficient
Spanish banking system, the Government last week agreed to the merger of all
state-owned financial institutions. By becoming the country's biggest banker
the Government hopes to be able to jawbone domestic interest rates lower.
A few weeks ago Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French Finance Minister, called the
strength of the Spanish currency - which has been trading at the upper limit
of its 6 per cent EMS band against the franc for more than five weeks -
'unnatural'. He said so again at the Group of Seven meeting in Washington
last month. In private the Spanish authorities, frustrated by their
inability to make the economy behave, might even agree.
Two years ago, frightened by rising inflation and apparently unquenchable
consumer demand, Madrid flung its economic levers sharply into reverse.
Import tariffs were lifted early to cheapen consumer goods. Anyone borrowing
cheaply abroad was forced to deposit up to 30 per cent of the loan, interest
free, with the Bank of Spain.
Growth in bank lending was limited, by decree, to 10 per cent after private
credit had grown almost 25 per cent the year before.
Amazingly, these ferocious measures have had little effect, although by the
beginning of 1990 industrial production was falling. The invasion of Kuwait
also helped because it panicked Spaniards into shelving investment
decisions.
But the Gulf crisis, perhaps, ended too early. The government had promised
to begin lifting its credit controls by the beginning of this year and it
has done so. As a result private credit is growing close to 20 per cent
again and the ALP, the broad money supply measure, is growing almost twice
as fast as its target.
Madrid, desperate to demonstrate its ability to control its economy, cut the
official intervention rate by one point at the Bank of Spain's regular CD
auctions in March, to 13.5 per cent.
The Central Bank governor was wheeled out to give a lame explanation. The
forecasts looked good, he said. But the Bank of Spain does not really matter
in this debate. It does what it is told by the Finance Ministry.
The Finance Minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, has been promising more interest
rate cuts this year but it is easy to misread that message. How does he make
borrowing cheaper without cutting official rates?
One of Mr Solchaga's gripes has been that, although the intervention rate
has been cut, the commercial banks have not been passing the benefits on to
borrowers.
What the banks have been doing is cutting rates on interest-bearing current
accounts launched 18 months ago and which threaten the high retail margins
that have made them some of the most profitable banks in the world.
Hence the creation last Friday of the Corporacion Bancaria Espanola (BCE) -
the aglomeration of the State-controlled Banco Exterior, the big public
lending group, the Instituto de Credito Oficial (ICO), which includes the
biggest mortgage and agricultural lenders in the land, and the Caja Postal,
the post office savings bank.
With combined assets of about Dollars 80bn, it is not only much bigger than
the biggest private bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), but its 19,000
employees and 1,200 branches are far fewer than BBV is saddled with, making
it a potentially powerful competitor.
Announcing the merger, Mr Solchaga repeated old arguments about only big
banks being able to compete in the Europe of 1993 and exhorted the remaining
private banks to think again about merging.
The point, though, was that the BCE would 'be belligerent in the financial
markets, which will oblige the other (private) banks to cheapen their loans
and give normal reward to deposits.' In other words, having failed to
convince Spaniards not to overspend, the authorities are back to attacking
the banks for lending so much so expensively.
This is an adventurous way of trying to cure inflation and cutting the cost
of borrowing.
Banco Exterior apart, the official lending bodies are famously inefficient.
In a recent interview the Prime Minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, warned that
'you can make a bureaucracy efficient, but it can never be creative'.
And the BCE will not solve the more immediate problem of French complaints
about Madrid's inability to cut rates further. Spain is not used to
international criticism. The reaction in Madrid has consisted mainly of a
hurt and whispered attempt to pass the buck.
Spain argues that the peseta is not the franc's real problem. The real
problem is the D-mark. Put aside the fact that the peseta and the franc are
at the top and bottom of their limits against each other in the EMS and it
is clear, they say, that if the Germans raise interest rates the franc would
also find itself on the floor against the D-mark.
The fact that the franc is not already there is that interventions by the
Bank of Spain and the bank of France are keeping it artificially strong.
The Spanish Government is keen to blame everybody but itself. Its banks are
distorting the money supply by lending expensively to eager consumers, and
the French are blind to their real problems. The only hole in this otherwise
impressive defence is the Treasury.
Here, the young Treasury chief, Mr Manuel Conthe, is a little more candid.
'Obviously there are some contradictions,' he says.
The Treasury has been scrambling to cut yields on all its paper for most of
this year. Last Friday it cut the interest rate on its 10-year bond 1.65
points to 11.83 per cent. Five-year yields have fallen to 12.26 per cent.
Foreign investors, astonished that a country with annualised inflation of
5.9 per cent still sells paper at almost 13 per cent, are being turned away
from Treasury auctions in droves. The volume of medium-term and long-term
paper held by foreigners tripled in the first quarter to Dollars 16bn.
Mr Conthe's problem is that he wants to build a credible market in
medium-term Spanish bonds (until now foreigners have bought mainly treasury
bills) but definitely does not want to become locked in to expensive
long-term borrowing.
The chickens are home and roosting.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Letter: Realities of pay policy and inflation control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RONALD DORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan writes (Economic Viewpoint, April 25) apropos of the
relentless rise in wages, 'employers and unions appear to have responded not
to fundamentals but to a backward-looking glance at the headline Retail
Prices Index'.
That weasel word 'fundamentals'] What does it mean? Here, it seems, 'the
forces of supply and demand which we know from our neo-classical economic
textbooks to be all-important'.
As everybody acknowledges - not least Layard and Nickell who popularised and
Samuel Brittan who continues to give credibility to, that dreadful concept,
Nairu (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment) - the segments of
the labour market where supply/demand forces work, where unemployment bites
fairly quickly on pay, are tiny; temporary secretaries in London,
construction labour, the office cleaning industry.
Average pay rise rates are overwhelmingly determined by bargains in the
unionised sector, amplified by the Confederation of British Industry's
'emergent-norm setting' - its monthly announcements of 'the average rate of
settlement so far this round'. And what influences those bargains? Such
factors as: the last year's inflation rate and expectations of next year's,
unions' perceptions of firms' ability to pay as evidenced in profit and
dividend levels, fairness demands prompted by self-awarded managerial salary
increases, skill shortages unrelated to general employment levels, the
confidence in the continued growth of markets, and so on. Are those who
bargain ever influenced more than marginally by what they read in the papers
about the rate of unemployment?
So why do we never hear about Nairie (the non-accelerating inflation rate of
inflation expectations) or Nairmsi (managerial self-indulgence) or Nairdi
(dividend increases), and continue to hear endless speculation as to whether
Nairu is going up or down?
Because, I suppose, Nairu deals with supply and demand - the fundamentals of
the textbooks. Can anyone think of a worse case of far-from-defunct
economists managing so successfully and for so long to screw up the thinking
of the practical men and prevent them from facing up to the realities of pay
policy and inflation control?

FT  07 MAY 91 / Power surge on the Parana river - The uncertain economics of
the huge Itaipu hydro-electric project, which has just been completed on the
Brazil-Paraguay border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stone that sings' is the English translation of the romantic Indian name
for the world's largest hydro-electric dam. Itaipu, a joint project between
Brazil and Paraguay on the rushing Parana river which borders the two
countries, was completed yesterday, reaching its full potential of 12.6m kW.
Begun in 1974, Itaipu, more than any other single project, symbolises the
grandiose designs of Latin America's military dictators of the 1970s and the
far-off days when Brazil's economy grew 10 per cent a year and foreign banks
fell over themselves to provide finance regardless of ecological concerns.
Its name notwithstanding, Itaipu does not sing but roar as 32,000 cubic
metres of water a second crash through the spillway, raising clouds of mist.
Inside the power house, each of the 18 turbines is large enough to house a
small symphony orchestra, and between them they will provide up to 35 per
cent of Brazil's electricity.
'This is the work of the century,' says Mr Fernando Ferreira, president of
Itaipu Binacional, the company set up in 1973 to build it.
According to Mr Ferreira, 12.6m cu m of concrete went into Itaipu's
construction - 15 times more than in the Channel tunnel - and enough to
construct all the buildings for a city of 600,000.
Just as staggering are the costs. Instead of the projected Dollars 2bn, 17
years on Itaipu has so far cost Dollars 18.3bn, making it the world's most
expensive dam.
'These figures are misleading,' says Mr Ferreira. 'Of this total only
Dollars 9.5bn was direct investment, the rest is financial costs. Investment
costs rose because of an overvalued cruzeiro and having to provide local
infrastructure for employees which at the peak of construction numbered
40,000.'
Of Itaipu's Dollars 16.9bn debt, Dollars 7.4bn is with foreign commercial
banks and a further Dollars 1.1bn with Brazilian banks. The remaining
Dollars 8.4bn is with Eletrobras, Brazil's state electricity company, the
country's largest foreign debtor.
Herein lies the real story. Remarkably, for a long-term project of such
scale with only Dollars 100m capital, much of the financing came from
commercial banks in the form of high-interest loans with short-term
maturities of six or seven years. There was no financing from international
institutions in the construction phase and only more recently in the
transmission phase did the Inter-American Development Bank offer two loans.
'We were never approached,' says Mr David Atkinson, Brazilian representative
of the Inter-American Development Bank. 'Ten years ago Brazil preferred to
go with commercial institutions; it was a matter of national pride.'
Nor was there any shortage of banks offering money. Citibank, Deutschebank,
Bank of Tokyo, Bank of Paris and J P Morgan all came forward.
Mr Joel Korn, president of the Bank of America in Brazil which led a
consortium of foreign banks, says: 'Given its long-term nature this project
should have been financed through co-financing with multilateral
institutions. But the banks never treated this as a development project. It
was seen as a sovereign risk transaction, decision-making driven by the
republic's guarantee rather than the project's revenue-generating
possibilities.
Seen in this context it becomes a lot easier to understand Brazil's Dollars
63bn commercial bank debt - the developing world's largest. In the debt-led
growth days of the 1970s Itaipu was one in a series of often wasteful giant
infrastructure projects.
Brazilian officials argue that at least they have something to show for
their debt burden, unlike neighbouring Argentina where much of the
borrowings found their way into the pockets of generals. Mr Marcos Azambuja,
director-general of Brazil's Foreign Office, explains: 'We don't have the
guilt of other debtor countries. Most of the money went to projects people
can see.'
That is not to say that money did not go astray in the building of Itaipu.
'Itaipu became a byword of easy pickings,' says one energy consultant,
adding: 'Brazil's energy sector has long been run as a source of political
patronage rather than as a business.'
Ironically, as Itaipu's completion was celebrated yesterday in a ceremony
attended by the Brazilian and Paraguayan presidents, the company was facing
financial crisis. Hit by Brazil's austerity programme, its customers,
including the electricity distributors Eletrosul and Furnas, have not been
paying their bills, and, according to Mr Ferreira, the company is now owed
Dollars 700m.
Mr Ferreira admits that one problem is Brazil's low energy tariffs which the
World Bank has been criticising for years. Even though recent rises pushed
the tariffs to Dollars 45 or Dollars 50 per MWh, these numbers are below the
bank's recommended Dollars 70. The tariffs are also unfairly weighted
towards the distributor (Itaipu, for example, gets only Dollars 18.75).
As a result, Itaipu cannot pay its bills. Of the Dollars 2.4bn revenue it
should earn this year, 80 per cent is marked for debt servicing, 10 per cent
for operating costs and 10 per cent for royalties to the two governments for
use of the river.
The Itaipu treaty signed between Brazil and Paraguay in 1973 entitles each
to 50 per cent of the energy. Any not used must be offered to the other at
preferential rates. Paraguay uses only 1.8 per cent of the electricity
generated, or less than half the output of one turbine. It sells the rest to
Brazil. Absurdly, however, it insisted that its nine turbines produce
electricity compatible with the Paraguayan grid which operates on a 50Hz
frequency. This then is converted at extra cost for the Brazilian market to
60Hz frequency.
But owed Dollars 84m by Itaipu, Paraguayan demands are mounting for a
revision of the treaty to allow it to sell its share to a third party, such
as Argentina, which uses 50Hz.
Negotiations with Argentina were one of the project's big initial
difficulties. Argentina lies downstream and claimed the dam would slow the
river's flow. 'Itaipu was a feat of diplomatic engineering,' said Mr
Fernando Reis, head of the Americas department in Brazil's Foreign Office.
Some Brazilian officials favour an integrated energy system between the
three countries as part of the Southern Cone Common Market, formed in March
with the aim of establishing a free-trade zone between Brazil, Argentina,
Uruguay and Paraguay.
According to Mr Alan Poole, an independent energy adviser, linking up with
Argentina's thermal power system would provide a safeguard in dry years for
Brazil, whose energy is 96 per cent hydro.
He says that relying so much on one source in the form of Itaipu is risky.
But Mr Ferreira protests: 'Just as all Britain's energy resources happen to
be in the North Sea, ours happen to be in the Parana river.'
Yet since Itaipu was built Brazil's rate of economic growth decreased
rapidly, reducing the need for such a large project. In October 1984, when
the first two turbines started functioning, energy consumption had grown by
11 per cent in the first nine months. Last year, by contrast, the economy
contracted by 4.6 per cent.
But Mr Ferreira insists: 'Without Itaipu today we would be facing
blackouts.' He claims that despite the explosion of costs the dam is still a
viable proposition. 'The energy produced is cheap - only Dollars 700 per
installed kilowatt. Even including debt servicing it comes to Dollars 1,500
which is a competitive price.' He adds: 'When its debts are paid in 2023 we
will have a dam generating Dollars 1bn a year for each partner.'
He admits, however, that to build a dam that size today would be impossible
both for financial and ecological reasons such as the high cost of
resettling the 40,000 people whose lands were flooded.
Facing his desk in the company's directorate in Curitiba, some 350km
south-west of Sao Paulo, is an oil painting of Sete Quedas, one of the
world's highest waterfalls which was destroyed during Itaipu's construction.
Ecologists only realised the danger in 1982 when it was too late and the
falls were lost. As for the banks, these days they are only too aware of the
financial dangers.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G R TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have to agree With Professor Desai's views (Letters, April 24) upon
the neglect of education being at the root of Britain's structural problems.
The notion of a skills gap in the UK is not a distant prospect; it is a
current reality. Only education, in the broadest sense, can close this gap.
The approach that supports the belief that qualifications do not matter is
one that also sponsors long-term decline.
As marketplaces become more competitive and the challenges facing managers
more complex so the debates about solutions have to be conducted at a higher
level. The laudable desire to involve as much of the workforce as possible
in problem-solving inevitably necessitates discussion at the lowest common
level of education. The lower this level is, the less efficient the debate
and the solution.
As they say at IBM. . .'If you think training is expensive, try
incompetence.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CAROLYN JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I was pleased to read Joe Rogaly's article 'Cardboard citizens' (April 30),
coming as it did in the week after the IMF urged Britain to cut benefits for
the jobless in order to curb wage increases.
Within Britain there is a tendency to blame trade unions and their members
for any decline in economic or industrial performance. High wage claims,
inflexible workers and an over-generous benefit system are often quoted as
undermining our ability to compete.
A recent report by the Institute of Employment Rights argues that Britain
will continue to decline while government and industry concentrate on
policies designed simply to cut labour costs.
Companies should concentrate on correcting their managerial and training
failures while developing innovative marketing, design and technology
policies. The government should reconsider its reforms of the tax and
benefit systems and look to more egalitarian social insurance provisions.
At the moment, the welfare state is failing to fulfil its original remit,
particularly the elimination of the need to beg. Instead state benefits are
being used as subsidies for inefficient firms dependent on low-wage workers
to keep them afloat.
Blaming the workers is all too easy. The government that honours, invests in
and rewards workers for their efforts will be the government that begins to
rebuild Britain.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Letter: Germany sets a competitive example
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr THOMAS MARTINI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the debate discussed in your article, 'Japanese cars and the EC'
(May 2), which is really a debate over what trade barriers EC politicians
will erect to prevent EC consumers from being able to exercise choice, too
little attention has been paid to the fact that, in 1990, Germany, for the
first time in over two decades, achieved a surplus in its car trade with
Japan. German cars to the value of Y593bn were imported by Japan, and
Japanese cars valued at Y518bn were exported to Germany. (Had exchange rates
not moved in Germany's favour in 1990, the bilateral trade would have been
in balance). This was achieved despite Germany being the only one of the
five large European car markets not to operate a quota system for Japanese
imports.
The obvious moral is that commercial success is most likely where there is
full exposure to competition, and where products are manufactured which can
successfully be sold abroad, rather than where internal wrangling over quota
extensions prevents rapid adaptation to best industrial standards.
At the FT London motor conference in March, Professor Daniel Jones, inter
alia European research director of MIT's global motor vehicle programme,
succinctly suggested that France and Italy would pay dearly for not letting
Japanese manufacturers into their countries.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stephen Fidler's article ('US seeks to raise World Bank's private profile',
May 1) leaves out answers to one vital question: Who is to gain?
The objective of structural reform promoted by the bank has, for some time,
been aimed at achieving more efficient resource allocation among the
economies to which they have been directed. At best results have been only
mixed. The failures have largely beeneither because of poor project
selection by bank staff or inefficient local management, or both.
Bank lending to the private sector is essentially an extension of the same
set of structural reform policies. These new ideas, if adopted, will not
necessarily expedite the development process as this new breed of private
borrowers will have to be at least partly vetted on the basis of their
respective projects' commercial viability. This defeats the objective of
alleviating 'backwardness' through sensitive resource allocation.
There is no guarantee that the new form of direct lending will enhance the
bank's record of picking winners - so yet further scarce resources will be
wasted at the expense of those who need them most.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Hang the Commons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whenever a general election looms I consider the parties and try to shut my
eyes to the awful prospect that one of them might win. What a delight it has
been to contemplate last Thursday's local election results and savour the
possibility that perhaps, with any luck, no party will achieve an outright
victory. A hung parliament is not a recipe for chaos. If you believe that,
join the blinkered troglodytes who think Britain is doing well under
single-party rule. A forced deal in the lower house is, rather, the only
mechanism that offers even a glimmer of hope that we may overturn our serial
elective dictatorship, abolish the Lords, write a modern constitution and
prosper in the 21st century as the Federal Republic of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.
The Liberals blew their chance in the late 1970s and Mr Paddy Ashdown is
over the top in demanding proportional representation without a referendum,
but we have to take what history offers us. If the leader of the Liberal
Democrats manages to win enough seats in the Commons to give him the
necessary leverage, and if he uses it successfully, he will deserve a statue
in his honour. Parliament Square is the correct site.
I enjoyed that. Now back to reality. The mundane question of the year is,
will Tortoise Major beat Hare Kinnock? In the original fable there was some
doubt at the beginning, but we all know that Tortoise won in the end. That
was because Hare lost his concentration, became over-confident, lolloped
about. Mr Neil Kinnock is doing none of that. He is leading the Labour party
as if the general election was due next week. Mr John Major is still trying
to find the starting line.
The two larger parties may be neck and neck in the opinion polls, but only
Labour is up and running, ready for a decisive national election. The
Conservative party is not. They are so unready that they failed to keep to
their strategy of introducing the health service reforms without making
changes that could damage their electoral chances. The job cuts by Guy's and
other opted-out hospitals may be right, and they may be technically outside
the domain of Mr William Waldegrave, secretary for health, but they need not
have been announced 10 days before the local elections. That was somewhere
between careless and unintelligent.
You can, however, bank on Labour's readiness for a national contest. The
party demonstrates every other day that it is fighting fit. If campaigning
is the yardstick, it is running rings around the Conservatives. It launched
no fewer than eight policy documents last month. Ostensibly aimed at the
local elections, they dealt with national issues: the arts, crime, health,
the environment, the family, education, and so on.
The rumbustious education secretary, Mr Kenneth Clarke, Only Labour is up
and running, ready for a decisive national election
has been obliged to respond, with increasing frequency, to the fresh
initiatives put out by his scholarly-looking Labour opponent, Mr Jack Straw.
Last week Mr Straw came out with a plan for broadening A-levels and
improving technical education for 16-18-year-olds; the best that Mr Clarke
could muster was that, just wait, his own gloss on technical education will
be published soon.
For the past several months Mr Gordon Brown has been advertising his 'policy
for industry', which is socialist to the extent that it might have been
written by Mr Michael Heseltine. You may or may not like the whiff of
interventionism discernible in this policy, but that is beside the political
point. Mr Brown has obliged Mr Peter Lilley, the industry secretary, to jump
to it, which he did smartly last Tuesday. Now he has to mouth the same
objectives as Mr Brown, leaving to the small print the considerable
differences between them.
Mr Michael Howard has had the unenviable task, for an employment secretary,
of defending the rapid increase in unemployment. His Labour counterpart is
one of the party's photogenic stars, the very image of a bright young
public-school conservative barrister, Mr Tony Blair. He has cajoled the
unions into apparent docility and now constitutes a not-so-secret weapon in
the battle for the centre-ground. Mr Blair has launched sections of his
party's policies for employment, training and reform of labour law five
times during the past couple of months and is due to bring forth a further
manifestation in a few weeks, when he will propose a cash-limited fund
against which bids could be made to support schemes to train employees in
work in areas of special pressure.
All this campaigning is being carried on in semi-private and in public. If
you are a captain of industry and you have not been invited to a discreet
meeting with Mr Blair, Mr Brown, Mr Straw or the shadow chancellor, Mr John
Smith, consider your position. Do you matter? Are you as important as you
think? But if you have been favoured you will know how prudent, how
reasonable, is the consumerist sales patter of these representatives of
producer interests. We can all now see the principal difference between
Labour and the Conservatives. The former will raise income taxes to fund
public services; the latter will proclaim an intention to improve services
and at the same time cut taxes. Labour has its arguments ready; the Tories
are arguing among themselves.
Maybe they will knock each other out and hang the Commons. The probability
is that more people will vote for lower taxes than the other way. Assuming
that when the time comes mortgages are down and the economic optimism is up
the Conservatives still stand the better chance of coming out as the larger
party; even an overall majority is not out of the question. If Mr Kinnock
had had the vision to embrace electoral reform wholeheartedly four years ago
he might be in de facto alliance with the suddenly important Mr Ashdown and
therefore in a commanding lead now. But he didn't and isn't.

FT  07 MAY 91 / No room for new faces at the top: In the first of a series
on women in management, Diane Summers looks at the challenges facing UK
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best man for that senior management job may well be a woman: few
organisations these days can afford to deny that possibility.
It is no longer acceptable - with the perceptible build-up of internal and
external social and commercial pressures - for organisations in many sectors
in the UK to present an all-male management line-up.
Self-interest is driving fierce debate in several organisations about
women's promotion to senior jobs. A series of reports in past months,
including an extensive study by the National Economic Development Office
(Nedo) on women in management, and the Hansard Society Commission on Women
at the Top, has prompted companies to think about strategies for the
promotion of women.
But these same organisations are finding that it may not prove easy to take
the issue beyond the point of tokenism. Good intentions by themselves are
failing to produce results, and women in senior management jobs remain a
rarity. On occasions a mirage of equality appears, partly because
organisations are quick to seize on senior female appointments for their
full publicity value.
On a single day last week for example, the FT reported that the BBC had
appointed Ms Jane Drabble as assistant managing director of BBC Network
Television and Ms Catherine Bell had been appointed head of competition
policy at the Department of Trade and Industry. In public life, five female
life peers figured in the list of new recruits to the House of Lords. And in
the City, top female appointments at County NatWest Investment Management,
and Schroder Unit Trusts, were announced.
Some might even be tempted to think that the 'glass ceiling' - that
invisible barrier which seems to block women from achieving the heights  -
while not shattered, has at least been cracked by the ascent of so many.
However, the fact remains that very few organisations will be able to come
anywhere near meeting a challenge issued by the Industrial Society earlier
this year for half of management posts to be filled by women by 2000.
The number of women in management jobs is growing, but so slowly that it
will be well into the next century before a female manager will be able to
look around her and see convincing numbers of her own sex in positions of
authority.
Currently she will see well-qualified women entering employment in similar
numbers to men. But at every hurdle on the way to the top she will see
female colleagues falling in greater numbers than her male counterparts.
Only one in four junior managers in Britain is a woman and, by senior
management levels, the number of women remaining in the race is down to just
one or two per 100 managers, as the Nedo study pointed out.
There is no evidence from underlying trends that, by the turn of the
century, senior managers are very much more likely to be women than they are
now - unless, that is, some positive strategies are pursued.
There are three principal reasons why some organisations are now
contemplating such strategies:
An increase in the supply of able female candidates on the job market.
Employers need to ensure they are not cutting themselves off from half the
available pool of talent;
The decline of traditional manufacturing industries, development of the
service sector, and the search for new markets, including those that are
able to exploit women's increased financial independence. Companies able to
draw on female management experience could gain a competitive edge; External
social changes. Organisations wishing to be viewed as responsible, equitable
and progressive need to pay attention to their image in relation to women's
employment.
Mr Alan Drinkwater, manager at IBM with responsibility for equal
opportunities, outlines the first and most important of these factors: the
search for talent. 'We want outstanding employees wherever they are. We want
both to attract them into the business and retain them. Some of those
employees will be women, so there's a business need to examine women's
aspirations.'
The same concern is expressed by Mr Mike Heron, Unilever's director of
personnel worldwide: 'We need as much talent as we can get and it's a scarce
commodity.' Organisations need to seek women out, ensure that they stay and
their full potential is developed, says Mr Heron. 'If you take the other
route, then you've got to have twice your share of the talented men. In a
market economy that's going to cost a lot of money.'
Other companies are driven by the second of these factors - the need to
understand their markets and spot new opportunities. Sectors such as
retailing, for example, have long recognised that the input of female
managers is a competitive necessity.
Ms Judith Byrne-Whyte, Equal Opportunities Commission assistant chief
executive, is cautious about stereotyping the contribution women have to
make within organisations. She agrees, though, that female managers may be
in a position to respond more quickly than men to consumer demand. 'Given
that so many purchases are made by women, surely women must get a feel for
what's going on much faster than someone who may be from a technical
background and who may not even buy his own clothes,' she says.
Retail groups were quick to realise that a positive image in relation to
women would attract customers, both male and female, says Ms Byrne-Whyte. 'I
really think that has to come from the inside. A proper equal opportunities
policy will shine through.'
Textiles, as a sector, heads the list of industries employing women
managers, according to the latest British Institute of Management salary
survey - one of the few rough guides to the position of women, by sector, in
management. Mr John Billing, Courtaulds Textiles director in charge of
management services, points to the company's increasing involvement in
clothing: Courtaulds supplies underwear to retailers such as Marks and
Spencer for sale under shops' own labels. The design and selling of these
products requires at all levels 'good representation of women in the
business', says Mr Billing.
Half the company's graduate intake is female: about 10 per cent of the top
250 posts are occupied by women, although the percentage at middle
management level is higher.
In financial services, women's increased participation in the labour market,
the introduction of independent taxation and the growth of personal
pensions, have all opened up new product possibilities.
The last and perhaps least tangible of the three main factors increasing
pressure on organisations to review their recruitment and promotion of women
is the change in the social climate. There has been a sharp increase over
the past decade in the proportion of women who are economically active, from
63 per cent in 1979 to 71 per cent last year. Senior male managers,
particularly those in the younger age group, are increasingly likely to be
influenced, both at home and at work, by women who have career expectations.
So what strategies are being adopted? Responses are as varied as the nature
of organisations themselves, the extent of perceived pressure for change and
the sectors in which they operate. Some organisations are in more of a hurry
than others.
The bravest are setting themselves targets: the BBC, for example, has said
publicly that it wants to see 40 per cent of middle management and 30 per
cent of senior management jobs occupied by women by 1996. Last year, when
these targets were announced, 10 per cent of senior BBC managers and 18 per
cent of middle managers were women.
For most organisations, though, target-setting would be seen as forcing the
pace of change. Targets are abhorrent to most employers, particularly in the
private sector: they are seen as dangerously close to quotas, and quotas are
thought to lead inevitably to discrimination in favour of women.
The more conservative companies are relying principally on increasing the
intake of women with management potential and hoping, somehow, that these
women will gradually feed through the ranks. But companies such as Unilever
are finding that it is not that simple.
Unilever is now recruiting almost equal numbers of young men and women,
purely on merit, to its widely-acclaimed graduate management trainee
programme. But three years ago senior personnel managers realised a shocking
fact: within five years 75 per cent of this elite female intake had left
Unilever for a variety of reasons, both domestic and linked to the culture
of the organisation.
The attrition rate for male trainees, at 50 per cent, was bad enough, but
the particularly high female departure rate led to a special investigation,
a working party report and a set of recommendations, many of which have now
been implemented.
Mr Heron expects to see gradual improvements following the introduction of,
among other measures, career breaks, a women's network within the
organisation, and the recognition of the pressures exerted on dual-career
families, particularly when it comes to the need to move people around the
world for their work.
The loss of half or more of a graduate intake is not unusual. One survey
quoted recently by the Institute of Personnel Management found that about
half of graduates starting training courses did not expect to stay with
their employer for more than three years.
Mr Peter Hawkins, who has just completed a study at Liverpool University of
graduate recruitment in the engineering industry, said that employers
commonly underestimated the costs of losing trainees.
'Some companies just look at the initial salary costs. But the real cost is
likely to be about four times that figure after two years, once you count
recruitment, training, administration connected with leaving and the
recruitment of a new person. Also uncounted is, for example, the lack of
performance of other employees as they cope with the disruption. One figure
commonly used is that it costs Pounds 250,000 to develop a graduate recruit
up to middle management level.'
One big employer, too embarrassed to own up to the fact publicly, lost all
its general management graduate recruits in one section before the end of
their training period - every one happened to be a woman. 'No one can tell
me why it happened,' says a senior manager. 'But if it had been a new
investment, or the loss of a piece of plant or equipment, there would have
been a major outcry.'
The Civil Service remains concerned about its female resignation rates at
all grades, although the differences in the rates between men and women has
narrowed in recent years: in 1982-83 74 per cent of all resignations were by
women, compared with 61 per cent in 1988-89. This narrowing follows the
introduction of policies aimed to help staff combine work and domestic
responsibilities.
A cost-benefit analysis of measures to make organisations the types of place
where women wish to work, therefore, will in many cases, yield strong
reasons for action.
Indeed, focusing on retention may be the key to meeting the Industrial
Society's challenge. Currently women are simply not there to promote: they
have fallen through a trapdoor long before the point at which they might
have met the glass ceiling.

Holding a Formula One motor race may not seem the most tactful way to
promote an environment conference, let alone the most environmentally
friendly. But Rio is the city where anything goes.
With preparations in full swing for the United Nations World Environment
Conference there in June 1992, all sorts of bizarre publicity ideas are
emerging. And the most controversial proposal is to hold a second Brazilian
Grand Prix in Rio during the conference.
Gilberto Cavalcanti, vice-president of the International Automobile
Federation, confirmed that Brazil has already asked the International
Automobile Federation for permission to hold the extra Grand Prix.
Discussions are under way with Rio authorities, he said.
The move has dismayed ecologists. They claim that promoting an environment
conference on the strength of racing cars burping far from ozone-friendly
fumes, is hardly good publicity for their cause or, for that matter,
consistent with Rio's aim to be the Green capital of the world.

The Bank of England is as famous for boasting its forecasts are superior to
the Treasury's, as it is for refusing to publish them. But what are we to
make of the Old Lady's sudden interest in cold-calling top economists and
inviting them in for a chat?
After years of turgid meetings of gilt-edged market makers at the Bank, some
teenage scribblers hesitated before accepting the invitation from Andrew
Brooks, head of forecasting in the Bank's economics division. In the past,
the information flow has been all one way and the central bankers kept
annoyingly silent.
Not so in the current round of informal meetings with the City, I hear. The
Bank has opened a 'two-way dialogue' with analysts, which has been going on
since the Budget and continues today.
The privileged few are understandably chuffed. They think they're in a
position to gain valuable insights into the Bank's latest thinking on
monetary policy. If so, it would be surprising. But the relaxation of the
tight-lipped policy is welcome, especially if it eventually leads the Bank
to publish its own economic forecasts, independently of those of its
Treasury paymasters.
What better way for the Bank to show it is not just another nationalised
industry?

Among the many place-name changes now being made all over the Soviet Union,
one which happened over the past weekend will cause the religious community
particular pleasure.
Zagorsk, 70km to the north of Moscow, has long been the religious centre of
the Russian Orthodox Church. The golden domes of its famous monastery gleam
through the grime of the surrounding industrial town, and attract the
faithful, as well as thousands of tourists. But now it is to have a new name
 -Sergievsky Posad, or Sergei's Settlement. Sergei Radonezhsky was the 14th
century founder of the ancient monastery.
Sergei's gain is Zagorsky's loss. The former chairman of the Moscow City
Communist Party, who was assassinated in the aftermath of the revolution in
1919, does not have the same sort of shelf-life as Russia's patron saint.

For sale: 230ft reinforced concrete tower on prime hillside site near
Chester. Owner, Science and Engineering Research Council, forced to sell for
want of cash.
It built the tower for nuclear physics experiments two decades ago. But
since no buyer is likely to want it for its original purpose of generating
bolts of electricity on the scale of lightning, the council is exploring
other potential selling points.
For instance, its height might have value for tele- communications - it
already has one microwave dish and could carry a lot more. Then again, it
could become a wind turbine for an electricity generator.
Another possibility is a platform from which sight-seers might save
themselves much footwork. Given a lift to the top, in fine weather they
could see the Peak Distict to the east, industrial Lancashire to the north,
Merseyside and the Irish Sea to the west, and Snowdonia to the southwest.
Professor Alan Leadbeater, director of Serc's Daresbury Laboratory, would
welcome suggestions for other uses - and even more so offers to buy.

It's over three weeks since Jacques Attali's European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development opened for business. But it still cannot
function properly until the US, the biggest shareholder, makes two key
appointments.
One is a vice-president for merchant banking able to work under the
visionary Attali. The other is a director who can keep the Frenchman in
check. Both must be Americans.
While most of the interest has centred on the merchant banking job, the
choice of the executive director could well turn out to be even more
important. For the moment, the job's being done by Emily Walker of the US
Treasury.
It has not gone unnoticed by students of international financial relations
that the first president of the World Bank - EBRD's grand-daddy - fell out
with the US executive director. And both were Americans.
Eugene Meyer, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve and owner of the
Washington Post, seemed an ideal candidate to be the first World Bank
president. He had run his own Wall Street firm and done various public jobs
for seven American presidents. But he quickly clashed with Emilio Collado, a
headstrong US director, and Meyer's unwillingness to engage in bureaucratic
infighting led to his sudden departure six months after he took the job.
Forty years on, America's delay in filling the EBRD posts suggests that the
same sort of tensions are not far below the surface.

BBC2's foreign affairs series, Assignment (7.45), visits the US to see how
some of the mis-applied principles of the 1960s generation (discrimination
with the word 'positive' stuck on the front, etc) have resulted in
resentment and accusations of censorship.
The third episode of Channel 4's engrossing series about England's Civil War
(8.00), concentrates on the actual fighting at such battles as Edgehill and
Naseby.
In the final episode of BBC1's series about a doubtful solicitor, Kinsey,
(9.30) many ends are tied: the runaway partner, Haynes, is rushed to a
Portuguese hospital, and Kinsey has to face up to his old emotional
involvement with Haynes' wife, Beth. But for true accounts of sexual
agonies, watch A Secret World Of Sex (9.50 BBC2) because today's episode in
this documentary series about sexual mores in pre-Second World War England
is the best of the lot. It tells of five women who had illegitimate babies
between the first and second world wars. Sex is also the subject of First
Tuesday (10.40 ITV) which deals with the abuse of young schoolboys. The boys
and their parents speak in what is described as 'an unprecedented set of
interviews'.

All credit to Opera North for making Tippett's opera available again, in
only the third British staging since he completed it in 1962: since the
inspired Hytner/Norrington production went down with the much-lamented Kent
Opera, King Priam has looked like enduring a long exile.
If 'inspired' is hardly the word for Tom Cairns' Opera North version, it is
at least worthy, serious and effective enough to capture much of the weight
of Tippett's noble work. New audiences will be impressed, as Friday's
audience plainly was. Those who have memories of the Kent production - which
cannot but be vivid - needn't rush (to Leeds this week, or Manchester, Hull
or Nottingham on the subsequent Thursdays); but those performances will
undoubtedly acquire greater force of conviction as they go along. The basic
lines of the opera are already well in place.
The principals, mostly youngish, are evenly matched, led by Andrew Shore's
strong, intelligent Priam: not an epical patriarch, but a tough
head-of-the-family (and Tippett has described the opera as 'essentially an
'opera of the family''). The conductor, Paul Daniel, has prepared the score
in precise detail, as Tippett's frieze-like construction requires, and its
sense is projected sharply. In the hands of Michael Cleaver and Kenneth
Heggie, the vital piano and guitar parts have flair and bite. On Friday the
dramatic pacing had less than its full grip yet: in particular, the rich
third act - anger and despair among the Trojan ladies, Priam's abject visit
to Achilles and his withdrawal from life - meandered ruminatively, where we
should feel an inexorable progress to the catastrophe.
In that act, both Eiddwen Harrhy's Hecuba and Linda McLeod's Andromache (too
similar on stage, though that was hardly their fault) were excellent in
distress, set in ripe contrast against Patricia Bardon's languid, glamorous
Helen. In their scene, as elsewhere, the producer has done too little to
animate the characters fully. There is a lot of unhurried strolling to
stand-and-deliver and then stroll off - not enhanced by sudden little bursts
of melodramatic arm-waving.
The few places in which a bit more is attempted (a decorative
hunting-tableau, a violent tussle between Hector and Paris, Priam's
spiritual agonising) only throw the physical limpness of the rest into stark
relief. In any case, the various track-suits in which the men are generally
garbed are inimical to any sense of wartime pressure and individual heroic
airs. In battle they pick up some blood and dust, and shorter haircuts, but
it is rather too late. (Opera chaps are as weedy as the rest of us, and need
more help to make a brave show.) The male chorus appear, thriftily, in
modern suits; all the women are luckier with their vaguely antique dress.
In fact Cairns's own designs are content to make detached, aesthetic
pictures. He likes tall walls and curtains that part to reveal new vertical
planes behind them (and in Act 1, part of a gigantic Greek vase lying on its
side). At the end, Priam's chamber might be a whitewashed Cretan barn, ready
for conversion by some owner abroad. Hermes, brightly and engagingly sung by
Mark Curtis, has wild hair, winged heels and a sporty yellow mac: a
designer's little joke.
Brian Cookson makes a properly sturdy Hector, Christopher Ventris a
pleasant, slightly gormless Paris (his younger self is portrayed with a will
by young Thomas Jackson). Neill Archer's fine, thoughtful Achilles delivers
his homeland-song beautifully, and there is a breath of sober tragedy in his
meeting with Priam. Unfortunately, the electro-acoustic arrangements were
inadequate to his great war-cry, which should freeze the blood but didn't;
nor were they altogether happy for the choral opening and close. George
Mosley's eager, manly poise was notably well-found for Patroclus.
The important 'Chorus'-trio - Nurse, Old Man and Young Guard - is rightly
cast from strength. Tamsin Dives was as eloquent as the royal Trojan ladies;
Tom McDonnell, if not as Old as he might be, had the tones of authority, and
Gordon Wilson's Guard was alert and communicative. Their measured commentary
was a vital strand in the action. There is a good trio of huntsmen, too. In
short, this was a creditable performance which may have the makings of a
really exciting one; musically, it is nearly that already, and only needs
everybody to seize the bit firmly between the teeth.

'The supply of authentic Giovanni Bellinis is unexhaustible,' or so Lord
Duveen used to assure prospective clients. Even then, in the 1920s, this was
not strictly true, and it certainly is not today. Old Master dealers - and
collectors - are in hot pursuit of an ever-dwindling supply of paintings,
which tend to be increasingly less old and less masterly.
Since its first exhibition a decade ago, however, Harari &amp; Johns has
established a well-deserved reputation for finding serious pictures. It is
symptomatic of the current market that the earliest painting in its tenth
anniversary offering, Five Centuries of Old Master Paintings (12 Duke
Street, SW1, until June 12), is a Madonna and Child with Saints by
Pesellino. Gold grounds are virtually unobtainable now - although Christie's
is selling an important Taddeo Gaddi on May 24. Relevant too that it is by
Pesellino, not by his master Fra Filippo Lippi, by one of whose altarpieces
in the Uffizi it is inspired.
Similarly, we find a portrait by Biagio D'Antonio rather than Botticelli and
a Landscape with Meleager and Atalanta from the hand of Giovanni Battista
Viola and not Domenichino. Duveen, no doubt, would have sold these works as
Lippi, Botticelli, and Domenichino. Only now is scholarship isolating
distinct artistic personalities for 'circle of' painters such as Biagio and
Viola.
Sixteenth-century pictures outclass those of the 15th, even here.
Outstanding among them is Dosso Dossi's half-length panel of St George,
which only came to light in 1975. It is an intense portrait-like
characterisation by the Ferrarese painter, who sets the saint against an
atmospheric Giorgionesque landscape of dawn breaking above the sea. A bright
foreground light pulls him out of the Stygian gloom, rendering his sleeve a
brilliant gold, playing across his breastplate, picking out the hairs of his
beard to concentrate on his troubled brow. Blocking the space between us is
the severed head of the dragon, its hairy snout substantiated by bold
strokes of pink and green.
More spectacular still is St Mary Magdalen at the Sepulchre by the Brescian
painter Savoldo, a glowing, golden variant of the even more seductive
silvery treatment of the subject in the National Gallery. The Magdalen is
depicted at the moment when, having visited the tomb to find it empty and
set down her ointment jar, she 'turned herself back and saw Jesus standing,
and knew not that it was Jesus'. There is no mistaking her former
profession.
The majority of the 17th and 18th century works are decorative and
commercial, with a substantial group of Roman capricci and Venetian vedute -
including a splendid Canaletto of the Colosseum - still-lifes and
flowerpieces. The most delightful of the latter is a confection of pale pink
roses and orange blossom by the best-known Spanish flower painter, Juan de
Arellano. There is a self-portrait bust by Murillo, a half-length portrait
of a gentleman by Rembrandt's pupil Govaert Flinck, and another, this time
full-length, by Gerard Ter Borch, stylish but understated to the point of
over-respectability. It is a relief - albeit briefly - to confront Ter
Brugghen's exuberant roistering fiddler, his bottle-nose shining like a red
traffic light at night. It is a marvellous picture, but hideous.
An unexpected pleasure is a conversation piece by Jan Joseph Horemans the
Elder, Antwerp's answer to Zoffany. Its neighbour, filling an entire gallery
wall, is more interesting still. This Good Samaritan is by the little-known
and short-lived Giovanni Battista Langetti, who was born and trained in
Genoa and went to Rome before ending up in Venice. His style is best
described as a sort of Ribera-Giordano inspired Caravaggism.
Once again, the gallery has found a quota of the impressive and the
unexpected for a show that, extending also to the German, French and British
schools, reflects the firm's unusual breadth of interest.
Old Master drawings rather than paintings are the subject of a loan
exhibition at Christie's (8 King Street, SW1, until May 14). The collection
was formed by Thomas Man Bridge, who travelled on the Continent in the
1830s, and bequeathed to Folkestone Library and Museum in 1924. This is the
first time that it has been on public display, and Christie's is its first
venue on a national tour that also takes in Dunkerque.
It is a curiously disjointed and uneven collection but it boasts a handful
of stunning sheets. An exquisite and richly washed drawing by Raphael's
pupil Perino del Vaga, The Reception of Psyche, is the most elaborate. What
a pity that its verso, represented by a photograph, could not have been
shown too. A Guercino study of a boy resting his head in his cupped hand is
a tour-de-force of draughtsmanship and observation, executed in that most
appealing of media, red chalk. Jusepe de Ribera employs it too, for a
careful and precisely outlined drawing of the Risen Christ. Bridge seems to
have had a predilection for the School of Bologna, and for 18th and 19th
century British watercolours and drawings. Spare a moment for John Brown's
sheet of studies of heads of monks, variously scowling under their ample
cowls.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Arts: Nureyev - Wembley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is being billed as 'Nureyev: The Farewell Tour', though the star denies
that it is a farewell and various doom-laden reports have been published
concerning Nureyev's dancing. On the evidence of Friday night's performance
at the unappealing Wembley Conference Centre, the gloom should concern the
nature of the presentation. This is basic to a point of insolence, and
unworthy of Nureyev and of at least some of the other artists who appear in
his concert programme. The lower, arena area of the hall is not raked, and
an intriguing view of events could be obtained by the audience as they
peered between the intervening rows of heads in order to see something below
the performers' knees. The stage is of good size, and, with the spendthrift
extravagance of several drunken sailors, the management provided black
curtains as setting. The accompaniment was recorded, and it was distressing
to see artists as distinguished as Evelyne Desutter (lately of the Monte
Carlo ballet) and the Bolshoy's Andrey Fedotov trying to cope with crippling
tempi in pas de deux from Don Quixote and Sleeping Beauty. But we know both
dancers are capable of very fine things, and Desutter's delicate grace,
Fedotov's elegance were, with Nureyev's performance in The Lesson, real
pleasures.
Nureyev wisely restricts himself to two works, Flemming Flindt's
Ionesco-inspired The Lesson and Jose Limon's The Moor's Pavane. Neither
makes the technical demands that Nureyev can no longer meet - I wish he had
not embellished The Lesson with a few laboured bravura steps - and he brings
a fine air of madness to the lunatic dance-teacher in this latter piece. It
is a genuinely chilling interpretation, and one finely supported by Desutter
as his pupil-victim and by Vivi Flindt as the accompanist-wardress.
About The Moor's Pavane I have many reservations. Limon's reduction of
Othello to the play's quartet of principals is a sacred text of Modern
Dance. With Limon it had a certain power; done now as a walk for
ballet-dancers who can indulge in a good deal of spurious emoting, it is nul
and void. And neither Nureyev, nor Flindt, nor Fedotov, nor Desutter, gifted
as they are, can redeem it from looking like Much Ado about Nothing.
The rest of the evening brought predictable sweetmeats. Some of Nureyev's
colleagues are from the Bolshoy, Staniskavsky and Odessa ballets, and they
offered unidiomatic Bournonville, a cabaret turn brightly calling itself a
'Bolero' by Petipa, and Dolin's Pas de quatre in which the dancer
impersonating Cerrito (whom the programme, a mine of non-information, does
not identify) was enchanting. I believe her to be Margarita Levina, a
ballerina from the Stanislavsky Ballet. A Franco-Russian dancer, Maria
Brissonskaya, gave a dry, dull account of The Dying Swan, and was no more
convincing in the ludicrous acrobatics of Oscar Araiz' Adagietto, where
Mahler is an excuse for reeling, writhing and fainting in coils. She and her
partner ( Alexander Bogatyrov of the Bolshoy, who deserves better) wore the
uneasy expressions of people who sense that the oysters weren't as fresh as
they ought to have been.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In each of its concerts this season, the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group
has included a premiere, and the last of the series on Sunday brought a new
work from the 21-year-old Scottish composer David Horne. Out of the Air had
been commissioned by the Michael Vyner Trust, set up to commemorate the late
director of the London Sinfonietta; though the Trust will naturally centre
its activities on the Sinfonietta, encouraging promising young composers to
write for the ensemble, it plans to spread its largesse as widely as
possible, and will work with other groups such as BCMG.
Horne is certainly a hugely promising talent; his towards dharma .., heard
at Edinburgh last summer, was evidence of that. He is now studying at the
Curtis Institute in Philadelphia and, naturally enough, still finding his
voice; perhaps for that reason Out of the Air, a sequence of 'five
inventions for ensemble', was not entirely consistent and coherent. The
first two movements are convincing, economical elaborations of rhythmic
figures; the final piece works up to a brilliant, extrovert finish. But the
slow third becomes over-dense and clogged, and the fourth lacks a
distinctive idea, so that the work seems more diffuse than it probably is.
The BCMG was conducted by Oliver Knussen; they had begun with a dreamily
sensuous account of his Ophelia Dances, coming up freshly minted and teeming
with ideas, each solo phrase lovingly shaped. The programme ended with
Birtwistle's Meridian, in a performance with the London Voices and the
mezzo-soprano Mary King, of glinting, crystalline textures and sinewy
expressive force.
Completed in 1971, Meridian is one of the most fascinating and transitional
of Birtwistle's early masterpieces. With its solo horn and cello it looks
back to the savage ritualised violence of the works around Punch and Judy,
while the hazy sound mobiles created by the eight sopranos start to explore
the world that would eventually encompass The Mask of Orpheus; its texts
too, a poem by Christopher Logue framed by stanzas from Thomas Wyatt,
dealing with the power of music and its fateful limitations, look forward to
that huge opera. Above all, though, it's a magnificently sustained piece of
word setting in its own right, with vivid ideas and highly wrought vocal
lines contained within a dramatic trajectory of irresistible certainty.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Arts: Kyung-Wha Chung - Barbican Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are not that many chances to catch Kyung-Wha Chung in performance
these days and so a solo recital is all the more valuable. For her
appearance in the Barbican's Celebrity Recital series on Saturday the
violinist had chosen a programme entirely of sonatas by Beethoven, though
not the favourite 'Spring' Sonata, which was perhaps fortunate on one of the
most wet and chill spring holiday weekends in recent memory.
The evening had a quite different atmosphere from the last violin recital I
attended at the hall, the one given by Anne-Sophie Mutter last autumn. These
are two artists with musical personalities poles apart: Mutter deriving all
her strength from a deep inner calm, Chung edgy and intense, a player on a
short fuse. You can almost see the physical tension build up, as she
crouches over the violin, ready to pounce on the next phrase.
The whole recital tingled with an electric intensity. Chung finds it
difficult to relax and play even the most lyrical movements without all that
nervous energy pushing its way to the surface. The concentration never
lapses and she has a way of ending phrases with such a powerful spark of
electricity that one senses the charge flowing on unabated through the
silence until she plays again, picking up the current where she left off.
In Stephen Bishop-Kovacevich she has found a pianist who in many respects
makes an ideal partner, ready to match his violinist's fire, but skilfully
able to channel her energies into performances that have depth as well as
surface energy. Between them they gave involving accounts of two of the Op.
30 Sonatas. The A Major was youthfully alert; the fierce C Minor was driven
along with demonic intensity, as though pursued by the Furies.
To follow these with Beethoven's thoughtful, nostalgic last Sonata, Op. 96
in G, made a well-balanced programme. Chung worked hard here to tame her
demon within, introspectively tapering away the ends of phrases, introducing
mellow colours in the slow movement, though it is difficult to imagine any
soloist failing to respond to an opening chorale as deeply felt as was
Bishop-Kovacevich's. Theirs is a partnership that could profitably be
pursued further.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Management: Why earn-outs can mean trouble in store - The
pitfalls of taking a deferred payment when selling a company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alex Rice* is worried. One year into a three year earn-out arrangement with
the company which bought his business Rice and the purchaser cannot agree on
how much profit Rice's part of the group is making.
Since Rice stands to make a lot of money if he can reach the targets set in
the earn-out he is understandably concerned at the disagreement.
'On a day-to-day basis the arrangement has gone pretty much as expected,' he
says. 'But now we have reached the stage of the year end audit and things
are getting a bit heated. The profits are turning out to be a bit less than
I thought. They say mistakes have been made but whether that is genuine is
not quite clear.'
Part of the difficulty, Rice believes, is that the purchasing company took
over control of his accounting department and the accounting staff who used
to report to him now report to head office. In addition to this the
accounting systems were changed so it is difficult to compare the business's
most recent profits with its performance in previous years.
Rice hopes that when profits are averaged out over the three years of the
agreement he will still qualify for a sizeable part of the deferred payment.
But like many other company owners who sold out on the basis of an earn-out
agreement he may be in for a rocky ride.
Few of the earn-outs which became so popular in the late 1980s have run
their full term. Most have been re-negotiated or terminated early when the
vendor and the new owners of his company realised the deal was not working
out as planned.
Between 60 and 70 per cent of earn-outs - most of which are intended to run
for between three and five years - are terminated within two years,
according to Stephen David, a director of David Garrick, a London-based
acquisitions specialist.
The economic downturn has meant that many deals, negotiated in the more
buoyant conditions of 1987-89, are producing less than expected pay-outs for
the vendor. A survey by 3i Corporate Finance of eight recent deals which it
negot-iated where earn-outs have been calculated showed three had produced
less than expected pay-outs. Of 10 deals where earn-outs still had to be
calculated six were not expected to live up to initial hopes.
The earn-out rose to prominence in the second half of the 1980s as a method
of allowing the owners of service sector businesses to realise what they
believed to be the full value of their companies. Bidders were not prepared
to pay high multiples for businesses with few tangible assets but they were
willing to be far more generous if payment could be made dependent on future
profits.
Typically the purchaser would make an initial payment equivalent to the
value of the net assets in the business and a second, larger payment to
cover goodwill if the business which was being bought met agreed profit
targets.
Overuse of the earn-out technique has plunged some of the more enthusiastic
bidders into difficulties. Many built up considerable commitments either to
pay out cash or to issue shares. Publicly-listed companies such as FKB, a
marketing group, WPP, an advertising company, and Shandwick, a public
relations firm, have disclosed sizeable earn-out liabil-ities.
The problems of the vendors, the owners of the small businesses so eagerly
sought by the corporate empire builders, have been less well documented.
'The vendor has to be particularly careful in negotiating an earn-out,' says
Stephen David. 'The buyer has the company and he also retains most of the
money. All the vendor has is his contract.' 'What can you do if the
purchaser does something you don't agree with?' asks Roger Wardell, who
gained half of the maximum Pounds 4m possible when he sold his company by
way of an earn-out. 'You would have to spend your own money fighting your
case while the purchaser can use the company's money.'
For the purchaser the earn-out is a means of retaining the loyalty and
commitment of the owner-manager until he can put in his own managers. But
earn-outs frequently face vendors with substantial conflicts of interest as
they set what is best for the long-term future of the company against what
would boost short-term profits - and the size of their earn-out.
Fewer earn-outs are being negotiated in the more sober climate which now
prevails but prospective vendors should watch for a number of key issues:
The length of the earn-out. Do not tie yourself into a lengthy agreement
during which the business and external circumstances could radically alter.
'Watch the length of the deal,' warns Ian Smith, a director of Livingstone
Fisher Associates, a London-based acquisitions firm. 'Four to six year
earn-outs are a nonsense. We normally look to arrange one to three year
deals.'
But even these shorter periods can prove irksome. 'I don't know how people
sustain it for two to three years,' says Wardell, whose earn-out lasted just
six months. 'From the point of view of both purchaser and vendor it must be
a strained relationship. On the one hand the vendor wants to be loyal and
group-minded but what if that hits him in the pocket book? You are pulled
two ways.'
The definition of what constitutes profits. Vendors should keep their
original auditors or at least retain the right to call them in to ensure
that the accounting rules are not changed, advises Neil Williamson, managing
director of 3i Corporate Finance. 'Valuations of stock and work in progress
are the most common sources of disagreement,' he points out.
'Write the rule book before you sign the final sale contract,' says Ian
Smith. 'You don't want the buyer massaging profits or imposing unexpected
management charges. There is so much room for interpretation in the
accounting standards. Get your old accountants to check the numbers.'
Problems in integrating the business in the larger group. To enable the
vendor to distinguish the profits of his company from the larger group the
newly-acquired company cannot be integrated into the group until the
earn-out period ends. This is generally thought to work against the
purchaser but does have implications for the vendor.
'It is true that the purchaser cannot impose anything on you but neither can
you take risks,' comments Richard Payne, who recently completed a one year
earn-out. 'The business went into a sort of limbo. It was quite unreal and
meant that for a time I could not further my career with the company we had
sold to.'
It is problems with integration which most frequently lead to the premature
ending of earn-out arrangements. If the buyer insists on making changes that
should be taken into account in the profit calculation. One purchaser
installed a computerised stock control system in its new subsidiary. Both
the investment cost and the resulting improvement in profits had to be
neutralised in the earn-out agreement.
Safeguards if the purchaser cannot pay. Some buyers with extensive earn-out
commitments have found they cannot afford to meet them. 'What do you do if
the buyer cannot pay?' asks David Teacher, a partner in London solicitors
Teacher Stern Selby. 'You can't sue because then the whole lot goes down.'
Teacher's answer is to structure deals to give the vendor the right to
regain control of his business if the purchaser is unable to complete. Even
if the vendor does not actually want to regain control he is in a stronger
position to renegotiate the deal in his favour. The culture clash when an
independent entrepreneur becomes an employee in a larger company. 'The
vendor goes to a smart hotel for the completion lunch and the champagne
flows. Next morning he sits at his desk and gets a memo telling him he
cannot keep driving the Rolls but is only entitled to a Ford Granada,' says
Stephen David. 'That can cause problems.'
The cultural issue is perhaps the most difficult to overcome. Many vendors
find they simply do not fit in to the purchaser's more formal corporate
structure. Many of the other pitfalls can be avoided, however, with a little
planning.
*The names of vendors and some details have been changed.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Management: You're not only there for the beer - Hints on
how to behave at receptions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Have you ever been an unwilling participant at a reception where you know
no-one? Is everyone else engaged in animated conversation with what looks
like a clutch of old school chums? Do you end up standing in a corner eating
and drinking too much before creeping out with the determination never to
attend such an event again?
Despite the recession, it is likely that your diary contains a fair
sprinkling of receptions over the next few months. In addition there may
well be professional dinners, reunions and trade shows.
Careful preparation and a more positive attitude to these events can reduce
or even eliminate the misery and can even turn them into a rewarding
experience, according to How to Work a Cocktail Party, an advice note to
staff from the Canadian affiliate of accountants Touche Ross.
The guide recommends that you:
Do your homework. Who will be attending the event? Who is the sponsor? Are
there likely to be specific people there you want to meet? If so, make a
note of their names, positions, recent mentions in the press.
Do not set out with a negative attitude or with the view that you are only
going for the food, the drink, or 'to put in an appearance'.
Set personal and professional goals for the event: to make, say, two new
contacts or to meet a particular individual.
Prepare your small talk and make a mental note of topical professional
issues which may come up in discussion.
Make sure that your partner, if you are taking someone, is also informed
about the event, the people and likely tone.
Arrive at the starting time. This means you will be in one of the happy,
chattering groups from the outset instead of trying to break in with the
other late-comers.
Walk into the room with confidence. Do not hang about in the doorway.
Look for people you know or want to know to get started but do not just
stick with people you know. The aim, after all, is to get to know new people
who may be fun knowing personally or worth knowing professionally.
Always give a firm handshake. Avoid jellyfish, knuckle-breakers, finger
squeezes and kissing. Do not burden yourself with plates, drinks or papers
which prevent you from keeping a hand free for shaking hands.
Place your name tag where it can be easily read. Use other people's name
tags to start conversations.
Prepare a brief self-introduction to outline how you fit in with the group
and provide others with enough information to start a conversation. It can
be hard to think up an opening line but it is better to say something than
wait for the best line.
When introduced to others repeat their name; it will help you to remember
it.
To enter an on-going conversation it is best to approach groups of three or
more people since there is a greater chance that one individual will be
willing to make an opening for a newcomer.
If the situation is uncomfortable, excuse yourself and move on.
Spend no more than eight to 10 minutes with any one person. To achieve a
smooth exit say that you are going to get something to eat or drink or that
there is someone else you need to talk to.
After the event review how the evening went. Were the techniques you used
successful? Did you notice any other examples of effective (or of
ineffective) behaviour? How many contacts did you make?
Social conditioning makes it difficult for many people to feel comfortable
at receptions. They feel uneasy talking to strangers, fear rejection and
would prefer to be 'properly introduced.'
But preparation and a positive approach can make a big difference to what
you get out of it, however.

and marketing.
The forum, a joint initiative of Hackney Business Venture, an enterprise
agency and the London Business School, is open to businesses in Hackney,
Tower Hamlets, the City, Islington and Waltham Forest. It has been sponsored
by accountants Touche Ross and the London City Action Team.

Employment agencies are likely to prove the most promising growth market for
factoring, according to a worldwide survey carried out by Factors Chain
International, an alliance of factoring companies in 35 countries.
Factors provide a range of services, advancing money against their clients'
invoices, taking over the management of their sales ledger and advising on
credit risks. The survey canvassed the views of 81 factors around the world.
The employment agency sector topped the ranking for both domestic and export
factoring. It was followed by home electronics suppliers, wholesalers and
toys/sporting goods businesses in the area of domestic factoring and by
electronic parts, office equipment and agricultural produce for export
factoring.
Contact Burson-Marsteller, 24-28 Bloomsbury Way, London WC1A 2PX.

A training programme for advisers and counsellors working in the small
business sector has been launched by Durham University Business School
(DUBs). The sessions are intended for staff of local authorities,
development agencies, chambers of commerce and training and enterprise
councils.
The subjects covered include assessing client needs; problem solving and
analytical skills and communication skills. Programmes are planned for June
23-26 and November 24-27.

FT  07 MAY 91 / The Week Ahead: First-quarter loss of Pounds 50m expected at
BP - Results Due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum is expected to announce on Thursday a loss of around
Pounds 50m for the first quarter, compared with a Pounds 344m profit for the
comparable period on the historic cost basis. However, if changes in the
value of oil stocks are stripped out, the accounting method favoured by the
group, the company is expected to show a small increase in profits of around
Pounds 35m.
The first quarter's stock losses are expected to be as much as Pounds 425m
compared with Pounds 70m last year.
Trafalgar House, the construction, property, shipping and hotels group, is
expected to announce on Wednesday a fall in profits from Pounds 117m to
around Pounds 40m for the six months to March.
The fall in profits is primarily due to the downturn in commercial property
sales and the effects of the Gulf war on its hotels and ships. Last year's
figures also included the lease of the QE2 liner to the Japanese.
After losing out to Otto Versand in the bidding war for Next's Grattan mail
order business, Sears, the retailing conglomerate has been left looking
rather forlorn.
That impression may only be strengthened when the company announces its
full-year results on Thursday showing pre-tax profits of about Pounds 110m,
a severe reversal on the Pounds 231.4m it achieved the year before.
Analysts will be keen to see what happens to the dividend. It seems likely
that it will be maintained but only with the thinnest cover.
Tate and Lyle, the world's largest sweeteners group which is trying to take
over Bundaberg Sugar of Australia, should report pre-tax interim profits on
Wednesday of Pounds 92.5m against Pounds 87.5m last year despite an adverse
movement of the dollar - the group makes 60 per cent of pre-tax profit in
the US.
Other major companies reporting next week include Jefferson Smurfit, the
Irish packaging group, on Tuesday, and SmithKline Beecham , the drugs maker,
on Wednesday.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Economics: German data will be scrutinised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are no economic statistics scheduled for release in the UK or France
but plenty this week in Germany and the US.
With the D-Mark so weak on foreign exchanges, and anxiety growing about the
shape of the post-unification economy, the releases will be scrutinised for
signs that the German decline has been exaggerated. This might prompt
sentiment that the D-Mark is oversold.
Improved weather in March could boost the production data scheduled for
release this week. For eastern Germany, data is thin on the ground but
anecdotal evidence suggests further output falls this year. Analysts expect
foreign manufacturing orders to have revived after the dollar's recovery.
Orders offer good clues to future growth in gross national product, which is
expected to slow to 1.9 per cent this year from 4.5 per cent in 1990.
Unemployment data should continue to show that joblessness is falling in the
west of the country, but not as fast in April as in March.
The current account, meanwhile, was in deficit for the second month running
in February, partly as a result of Germany's contributions to the allied
effort in the Gulf War. With domestic demand strengthening, Germany's
merchandise trade position has been deteriorating, with export volumes lower
than a year ago and imports markedly higher.
In the US the focus will be on the Treasury's quarterly refunding. Though
the outlook for US bonds is favourable - with last week's cut in the
discount rates and evidence of subdued inflation likely in producer prices
figures on Friday - there are fears that the Treasury will eventually have
to raise more funds because of the recession. This is making the market
anxious about supply and the likely absence of Japanese buyers.
Other notable events and statistics, with median market forecasts from MMS
international, the financial research company, include:
Today: US, wholesale trade balance for March, start of Treasury Quarterly
refunding, consumer credit (down Dollars 1bn), three-year note auction,
senate banking committee hearing.
Tomorrow: Canada, housing starts (110,000). US, 10-year note auction.
France, Victory Day, all markets closed.
Thursday: US, 30-year bond auction, weekly initial claims and weekly money
supply data. All markets in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Holland, Austria and
Switzerland closed for Ascension Day. Canada, new housing price index.
Australia, April employment (down 20,000) and unemployment rate (9.4 per
cent).
Friday: US, producer prices index (0.1 per cent), excluding food and energy
(0.2 per cent). Canada, employment growth (flat), unemployment rate (10.6
per cent).
During the week: Germany, April unemployment (west down 15,000, east up
40,000), vacancies, unadjusted for April, industrial production and
manufacturing orders for March, current account balance (down DM3.5bn) for
March.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Royal Mail performance pay plan for managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL MAIL is to pay senior managers bonuses worth up to Pounds 20,000
if they meet new efficiency, profit and individual targets.
The inducements are aimed at putting the Post Office on a footing akin to
that in the private sector by introducing 'a strong business culture' into
the corporation.
Managers taking charge of the nine independent business centres, replacing
the old 64 divisional districts early next year, will be offered bonuses
worth up to a quarter of their salaries, which are expected to range from
Pounds 45,000 to Pounds 60,000.
Mr Bill Cockburn, Royal Mail managing director, re-fused to say whether
there would be penalties for those who failed to meet the targets. He said:
'If they are not successful there are a whole range of things we can employ
to make them successful.'
Managers of the new business centres, organised in geographical areas, will
be in charge of their own pay bargaining, quality of service and
profit-and-loss accounts. They will also be expected to generate initiatives
aimed at boosting profits and turnover.
Mr Cockburn said: 'They will have much more freedom to think up their own
ideas on how to generate additional profits. They will be judged on specific
individual targets related to their personal performance.'
That might lead to fierce competition between managers in different areas.
If the manager in charge of Scotland, for example, initiates a scheme that
increases productivity, those in the rest of the country will be under
pressure to trump it with an idea of their own.
In a separate move, the Post Office has established a joint body with the
Mail Users' Association, a pressure group that claims to represent
businesses with postal bills totalling Pounds 40m a year.
The Postal Forum, which will also include representatives from other trade
organisations, such as the British Direct Mail Association, is aiming to
improve postal services.

FT  07 MAY 91 / ILO seeks end to ban on unions at GCHQ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OUR LABOUR EDITOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Labour Organisation, the United Nations agency, has called
for talks between the government and unions as a way of ending the block on
union membership at the GCHQ communications centre in Cheltenham.
An ILO committee of experts has renewed its criticism of several aspects of
British labour law in spite of hearing a defence of legislation from the
government. Britain may be asked to explain further at the annual ILO
conference next month.
Although the government could ignore the ruling by the committee of experts,
it is a signatory to the ILO and the criticism of several pieces of
employment legislation since since 1979 is potentially awkward.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said yesterday that it was
'shameful that a country and a government that places so much store on the
authority of the UN and the value of world opinion' should be criticised in
this way.
Mr Willis said the government should follow the advice of the committee of
experts and 'bring this country in line with civilised standards without
delay'. The ban on independent unions at GCHQ has existed since 1984.
The ruling by the committee of experts criticises the provisions of the 1988
Employment Act under which unions are prevented from disciplining members
who refuse to take part in industrial action called after a ballot.
The committee says that interferes with the right of unions to set their own
constitutions. It says unions should be free to impose sanctions on members
who will not comply with democratic decisions.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Rail unions to vote over Thursday Tube strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of rail unions are to decide today whether to hold a 24-hour strike
on London Underground on Thursday after considering a six-point proposal by
managers to end the dispute over 1,005 job cuts.
The one-day strike might go ahead even if leaders of the RMT and TSSA rail
unions agree a settlement and decide not to continue with a series of
one-day strikes they called after balloting on London Underground's cuts.
The RMT, which represents 12,000 of the workers balloted on action, said the
Thursday strike could be called off today if a settlement was agreed. The
executives of the two unions would have to decide whether to do so.
London Underground said it had made a six-point proposal in talks at the
Acas conciliation service on Friday. It said it believed the proposal
addressed many of the concerns of the unions and hoped that a settlement
could be reached.
The corporation has warned staff that if they take participate in industrial
action, they face being suspended and may be dismissed. It wants to prevent
a prolonged campaign of industrial disruption this summer.
The job cuts, including the loss of about 300 posts in ticket offices, were
planned by London Underground after it sustained an unexpected Pounds 92m
loss. It says that automation of ticket sales has made the cuts possible.
The unions have argued that they might endanger passengers as well as
cutting earnings in the long term. Among the job savings would be 30 jobs
involving the daily cleaning of dust trays under escalators on the network.
The rail unions are in the middle of a dispute with British Rail over the
annual pay round. The RMT has decided to ballot on industrial action among
60,000 members in British Rail after rejecting a 7 per cent pay offer.
Journalists with the Haymarket publishing group, whose titles include
Campaign, Marketing and GP, are likely to stage a one-day strike today,
after the group's refusal to restore collective bargaining rights.
Haymarket, whose founder and majority shareholder is Mr Michael Heseltine,
the environment secretary, intends to negotiate the pay and conditions of
its 250 journalists on an individual basis. Pay offers and settlements
remain above the rate of inflation but are following an increasingly diverse
pattern, according to a report published by Income Data Services research
group yesterday.
April pay settlements in the retail sector, for instance, ranged from 5 per
cent (House of Fraser) to 13.7 per cent (Woolworths), with a similar spread
in other sectors. 'With average earnings remaining sticky above 9 per cent
and inflation falling towards 6 per cent and below, a substantial
3-percentage-point gap is appearing'.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Call for ban on tying in services to mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAW Society has called on the government to impose a market-wide ban on
the tying-in of financial services to residential property loans.
The society says a ban would promote competition between financial
institutions, which from next year will be able to provide conveyancing
services to their borrowers, and protect consumers by offering them a choice
in selecting the different ser-vices needed to buy or sell a house.
The government proposes, under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, to
allow the tying-in of services provided consumers are given written
cautions.
The society says this 'half-hearted approach' gives consumers no clear
rights to buy their mortgage, insurance, estate agency and conveyancing
services from separate providers at separately identified prices.
The government's approach focuses on the timing and content of the written
cautions.
The society says that if this system is adopted, the warning notice should
be given to to mortgage applicants with their application form and not after
the application has been completed.
Mr Walter Merricks, the society's head of communications, accused the
government yesterday of shamefully abandoning the interests of consumers and
giving in to pressure from the large lending institutions.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Companies found ignorant of EC market law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESEARCH shows that most of the UK's top companies have a poor knowledge of
European Community competition law, Robert Rice writes.
Market studies carried out for Theodore Goddard, a leading City law firm,
indicate that only 4 per cent of UK companies knew that the EC could impose
a fine of up to 10 per cent of a company's turnover for contraventions,
compared with 28 per cent of their French counterparts. The survey covered
50 leading companies in the UK and France with a minimum turnover of Pounds
70m and a similar number of advisers including lawyers, accountants and
bankers.
Yet 84 per cent of the companies had been involved in a cross-border merger,
acquisition, joint venture or trade agreement in the EC in the past three
years. Almost all expected to be involved in such activity within the next
five years. All the French companies had recent experience of cross-border
activity.
Overall, 84 per cent of the companies thought that their understanding of
national competition law was 'fairly good'.
Even so, 64 per cent of the UK companies admitted a 'fairly poor' or 'very
poor' knowledge of EC competition law. The comparable figure for French
companies was only 8 per cent.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Big rise in installations: FT Satellite Monitor
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of satellite television installations has more than doubled to
encompass nearly 1.5m homes in the past year, Alice Rawsthorn writes.
Figures from the FT Satellite Monitor indicate that in spite of the
recession there were 1.48m installations by the end of April, compared with
653,000 at the same time in 1990.
The number of satellite dishes has increased each month this year, from
1.3bn in January. Nearly 7 per cent of homes now have access to BSkyB
television.
The Satellite Monitor, a monthly study compiled for the FT by Continental
Research, suggests that another 414,000 homes 'definitely' plan to install a
satellite dish and a further 1.74m homes will 'probably' do so.

FT  07 MAY 91 / CBI survey reveals European disunity over cost of living
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS EUROPE prepares for a single European market in 1992, a study of living
costs in the Community finds some startling discrepancies, writes Neil
Buckley.
West European Living Costs, published yesterday by the Confederation of
British Industry, compared the cost of everything from a hair cut to renting
office space in 16 European countries. While the CBI warns its figures are
only a rough guide, the results are revealing. In 1990, for example, the
managing director of a medium-sized company in Switzerland would have earned
the equivalent of Pounds 112,900 gross at present exchange rates. In Britain
he would have made Pounds 56,815, and in Portugal as little as Pounds
16,570.
A sales manager with a similar-sized company would, however, be best
rewarded in the Netherlands, earning Pounds 75,000 last year, compared with
an average of Pounds 29,610 in Britain. Portugal is bottom of the league
again with Pounds 10,890.
Even the highest earners would probably prefer not to have to rent
accommodation in Italy, where a three-bedroom unfurnished flat in a good
area can cost more than Pounds 1,800 a month. This is more expensive than a
furnished flat in central London, at between Pounds 866 and Pounds 1,625 a
month.
At the other end of the scale, the Greeks pay an average of Pounds 380 a
month.
Italy also tops the house price league, with the cost of a three- or
four-bedroom house weighing in at Pounds 688,000, three times the price of a
similar house in outer London and eight times Norway's average of Pounds
86,960.

FT  07 MAY 91 / The European Market: Power plant competition opens charged
debate - Free trade threatens link between utilities and plant suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN European Community electricity suppliers clashed last month over access
to power transmission grids, they were simply illustrating the inevitable,
and normally inviolate, connection between politics and energy.
Further up the supply chain the thorny issue of fair competition for power
plant orders is producing a similar politically-charged debate.
Equipment producers are asking how the European Commission's efforts to
liberalise the EC energy market and open up public purchasing to competition
will affect the cosy arrangements between many national utilities and their
power plant-manufacturing compatriots.
For proponents of free trade the outlook is generally positive. Spurred by
privatisation, the UK market is now open to all-comers, as shown by last
year's award to Siemens of a Pounds 350m contract to build a 900MW power
station at Killingholme, Humberside. That broke the domination of the UK
power plant market by domestic companies.
More open competition may take longer elsewhere, but seems inevitable. Some
obstacles remain, however, and US suppliers in particular are worried about
their access to the post-1992 market.
Mr Percy Barnevik, president and chief executive of Asea Brown Boveri,
Europe's largest electrical engineering group, says: 'Many people say they
don't believe (open competition) will happen because it's breaking a
100-year tradition.
'These national industries in power plant have been protected and isolated,
each in their own country. But the British have been the first of the big
markets really to open up for public bidding. The French and the Italians
will probably come last, but there is no way they can continue with
protection five or 10 years from now. I don't think Brussels would allow
it.'
A recent study* by Mr Steve Thomas and Mr Francis McGowan, of Sussex
University's Science Policy Research Unit, points out that EC countries are
not the only culprits.
Few goods, they say, are further from the ideal of being freely traded in a
world market based on price and quality than the main components, notably
the turbine generator, of power stations.
'Throughout its history, the heavy electrical industry sector has been
characterised by a dominance of protected home markets and suspected cartel
behaviour by the producers,' the study states.
Looking at purchases by EC countries, it points out the consistently high
proportion of generator sets supplied to home markets, with trade between EC
countries accounting for just 8 per cent of the 318,540MW of capacity
supplied since 1955.
But, says the study, the significance of trade between supplier countries is
even more marginal than the figures indicate, as intra-EC trade generally
involves customer countries with no manufacturing capability.
EC power plant manufacturing capability is almost totally concentrated in
four member states, the UK, France, Germany and Italy.
'It is this lack of trade, and its possible roots in the way that
procurement decisions are made, that the Commission wants to tackle,' say
the authors.
It suggest a number of reasons why the current situation has developed.
Close relationships between users and suppliers are vital, and utilities see
considerable advantage in placing business with trusted local suppliers.
Governments have often obliged utilities to buy from domestic suppliers
because of broader industrial policy objectives. This has long been a
tradition in France, for example.
The utility may be circumscribed by market-sharing activities of the
suppliers themselves, or less explicit behaviour such as not bidding
seriously in each others' markets.
The central factor, however, is seen as the utility's operating environment.
'For most of the century,' says the study, 'electricity has been a cost plus
industry. There has been no real incentive to minimise cost.'
In recent years EC governments have managed to keep their mainly
state-controlled utilities out of directives on liberalising public
purchasing. But the 1992 proposals, which identify public procurement as a
key obstacle to a single market, have given the Commission the initiative.
After much debate EC industry ministers finally passed the so-called
Utilities Directive in September. From 1993 utilities will have to give a
fair chance to equipment suppliers in all member states.
'Public' means 'public supply' rather than public ownership, so that
includes practically every power generating company in Europe apart from
industrial cogenerators.
Much will now depend on how the programme is policed. Compliance procedures
for the directive are being discussed, and utilities are unhappy that EC
regulators may be able to stop a contract in its tracks if an infringement
is spotted.
Nevertheless, the study cites recent events in the UK to suggest that, when
confronted by a more competitive regime, utilities adopt a different
approach to purchasing decisions.
It also believes the recent cross-border mergers among suppliers, blurring
their national identity, may weaken the utilities' duty to support their
local manufacturer.
Another key objective for the EC in liberalising the utilities' purchasing
policy was to achieve a much-needed rationalisation in the European heavy
equipment industry. The prospect of changing attitudes from utilities and
governments has been a factor in producing the new alliances, the study
says.
But other trends in the industry - changing technology and faster growth
prospects in non-EC markets - have helped produce this rationalisation of
overcapacity anyway.
The new-look European heavy equipment sector, with cross-border ownership
and manufacturing, is generally enthusiastic about the new arrangements.
Swiss-Swedish ABB, after all, is technically based outside the EC, but Mr
Barnevik says with some justification: 'If there was no change from the
present situation, no one would be better placed than we are because we have
a seat in each country.'
At GEC Alsthom, the Anglo/French joint venture that emerged from the
rationalisation of the late 1980s, Mr Jim Cronin, joint managing director,
says he is praying for 1992 to become a reality, accompanied by monetary
union.
'Even with the ERM we are not going to get open competition easily for
capital goods projects. We still have differential interest rates, and there
is no means for inter-government financing.'

<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday warned that Germany's inflation rate could approach
4 per cent by the end of the year, in the wake of a landmark 7 per cent pay
deal in the metal-working industry reached at the weekend.
Mr Lothar Muller, president of the Bavarian regional central bank and a
member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, ruled out interest rate
cuts in coming months as a result of the 'stiff breeze' blowing on the
inflation front.
Mr Muller said the annual rate of price increases was likely to rise to 3.5
to 4 per cent by the end of the year, fuelled by tax increases as well as by
latest wage settlements. This compares with the present rate of 2.5 per
cent.
The weekend pay deal, coming after a week of warning strikes organised by
the IG Metall trade union, was reached for 700,000 workers in the
pace-setting North Wurttemberg-North Baden region in south-west Germany.
Made up of a 6.7 per cent rise plus other top-up payments, the accord is
likely to become the norm for nearly 4m west German metal industry workers.
The agreement is also expected to be adopted for 1m east German
metal-workers.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Soviet MPs set to approve emigration law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Soviet parliament may today approve a long-awaited emigration law which
the US has made a precondition to granting the country most-favoured-nation
trading status.
But a new catch to the draft law, which has been held up since its first
reading last year, is that it would take effect only in July 1992.
Previously Soviet officials have said only a six-month period would be
needed before a more liberal passport system could be operated.
Conservative opponents of the law, which establishes the right to free
travel and emigration, fear it will lead to a massive exodus of Soviet
citizens and continue a 'brain drain' which started with Jewish emigration.
The proposal for the legislation to take effect only in mid-1992, contained
in an accompanying resolution submitted to deputies, is an apparent
concession to that opposition.
While it has become easier for Soviet citizens to leave the country under
President Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, they still need an invitation
from foreign hosts or a business reason to travel, even for a short stay
abroad.
Not surprisingly, a recent opinion poll showed that 93.6 per cent of Soviet
citizens wanted a free exit law to be adopted swiftly. The poll, published
by the weekly newspaper Nedelya, also suggested that only 20 per cent feared
it would unleash mass emigration.
Soviet authorities have estimated that between 500,000 and 3m people could
emigrate if legislation was passed. Some Soviet officials have put out the
wilder figure of up to 7m - in order, many suspect, to frighten western
countries which have nagged Moscow on the issue of emigration. Nearly
500,000 people emigrated last year.
But once the new law is passed, Soviet citizens will be restricted by tough
visa requirements now being applied by most western countries. Many will
also be unable to afford the cost of buying hard currency, and queues for
tickets are months long.
The absence of a free emigration law not only violates the Helsinki
agreement, providing for the free movement of citizens, but has also been a
stumbling-block in trading relations with the US. The Jackson-Vanik
amendment, dating from the 1970s, prohibits the US government from granting
export credits to the Soviet Union until it allows free emigration.
Last year President George Bush suspended the amendment for six months,
pending the legislation's expected adoption this spring. Washington has also
regularly granted the Soviet Union credits to buy US grain.
It is unclear, however, whether the Soviet law, if passed in its present
form, will overcome US objections.
Applicants seeking to leave the country for good still need an invitation
from relatives living abroad. They can also be barred from leaving for a
period of up to five years if they are deemed to hold 'state secrets' (this
is progress, in so far as 'holders of state secrets' could be blocked from
leaving indefinitely in the past). Exit visas can also be denied to people
involved in criminal investigations, as well to men eligible for military
service.
Finally, the Soviet government reserves the right to suspend free exit
legislation in case of unspecified 'threats to state security'.

<TEXT>
THE SOVIET government yesterday transferred control of coal mines to the
Russian Federation, as part of a deal with Mr Boris Yeltsin to end a
crippling two-month coal miners' strike.
But Mr Alexander Smirnov, a strike leader in the vast Siberian Kuzbas coal
fields, said the Kremlin's signature yesterday of a protocol relinquishing
the mines did not yet mean an end to strikes. He said a third of the 80
Kuzbas pits were still idle yesterday, together with 25 other pits in the
area.
Mr Smirnov said the striking miners would wait to see the fine print of the
agreement, before calling off industrial action which has paralysed sectors
of Soviet industry.
He said leaders of the local strike movement would today meet their
counterparts from Vorkuta, the other Russian mining region covered by the
protocol, together with miners from the Donbas in the Ukraine, where the
strike has all but crumbled.
Meanwhile, workers in the vast Siberian oil and gas fields of Tyumen have
written to President Gorbachev demanding a tripling of their pay and an
increase in the extremely low internal oil price of Rbs38 a tonne to Rbs180.
And a group of workers at the huge Kirov plant in Leningrad yesterday
launched a warning strike to call for Mr Gorbachev's resignation and protest
against a proposed one-year ban on strikes.
The protocol, signed by Mr Yeltsin last week, gives the Russian mines more
independence from the state and the right to spend part of their hard
currency revenues on imported goods and other benefits for miners. But
details of the protocol have yet to be published. It is also likely to be
followed by a transfer of other industries and plants to Russian
jurisdiction. Workers at the giant Uralmash engineering plant in the Urals,
for instance, last week voted in favour of a similar transfer.
Kommersant newspaper said yesterday that miners would be able to dispose of
7 per cent of the Russian mines' hard-currency earnings. It also reported
that the protocol provided for the transfer to Russian jurisdiction of two
big steel plants.

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Korea is to deny permission for new public and commercial buildings
until the end of September, the Economic Planning Board (EPB) said
yesterday.
The measure is part of a package aimed at curbing the growth of the
construction sector, which has expanded rapidly over the last two years and
is fuelling inflation and exacerbating a labour shortage.
Under the terms of the package, drawn up by the EPB and related ministries,
new construction by the government and by state-invested institutions will
be delayed until the end of September. In addition, won 400bn (Pounds
326.4m) will be cut from funds supplied to financial institutions to provide
housing loans.
Permits for private construction of apartments outside Seoul and above 84.8
square metres will be withheld until October and will also be restricted for
the building of department stores, hotels, public baths and pharmacies.
In a separate measure, also aimed at easing the impact of rising land costs,
the government said business groups which fail to sell land not directly
related to their business activities will be unable to issue overseas
securities.
The policy is the latest step in the government's attempt to curb real
estate speculation which is one of the main factors in rising land costs. In
the first quarter, land prices in Korea rose by an average of 4.7 per cent.
There is also concern that the rapid expansion of the construction sector is
creating an imbalance in Korea's growth pattern.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE recent improvement of political relations between France and Iran was
taken a large step forward over the weekend during talks in Tehran between
the two foreign ministers. It is now expected to culminate in a full-scale
reconciliation, with a visit to France soon by President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
Relations between the two countries became strained after the Shah was
overthrown by the Islamic revolution of 1979, and were aggravated by a wave
of Iranian-sponsored kidnappings and terrorism attacks in France in the late
1980s.
In the last two years, however, the pragmatic moderation of Iranian policy
under President Rafsanjani has opened the door to more frequent diplomatic
contacts between the two countries, starting two years ago with a first
visit to Tehran by Mr Roland Dumas, French foreign minister, and followed
last December by the return visit to Paris of Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, his
Iranian opposite number.
The French government has shown itself anxious to settle the big financial
dispute, over nuclear co-operation contracts, left hanging in the wake of
the fall of the Shah's regime, and now appears ready to make significant
concessions to finalise the matter. Indeed, the French Foreign Ministry
appears determined to override the negotiating reservations of the Finance
Ministry, according to reports here.
French anxiety for reconciliation with Iran is largely attributed here to
eagerness to secure access for French companies to the lucrative Iranian
market.

<TEXT>
MORE than a million people are facing food shortages in the inaccessible and
drought-devastated eastern region of Ethiopia.
A huge influx of refugees fleeing civil war in Somalia and impoverished
Ethiopian refugees returning to the arid Ogaden and Harerge regions has
created a new human crisis, adding another burden to the already
over-stretched relief effort in the famine-endangered country.
In the northern provinces of Eritrea, Tigray and Wollo, relief agencies are
already trying to deliver 1m tons of food this year to an estimated 4m
people at risk of starvation.
But the size and the speed of the influx into the east and the logistical
problems getting food there have placed additional burdens on aid agencies
and pushed up the total food requirement for the country to 1.275m tonnes of
food.
'Our priority is in the east at the moment,' said Mr Micheal Ellis, director
of operations for the World Food Programme. 'We are desperately trying to
spread what little food we have coming in but with a shortage of food there
has been a serious decline in nutritional levels, especially among children
in the refugee camps.'
The WFP has said 240,000 tons of food aid was needed but that there were
firm pledges for only half the amount.
According to Mr Scott Fahia of the relief agency CARE, the problems of
drought have been exacerbated by the disruption of cross-border trade with
Somalia and a deterioration in the security situation.
Normal problems of deteriorated roads, lack of trucks and fuel, and heavy
rains have been compounded by the growing insecurity as rebels intensify
their campaign to overthrow President Mengistu Haile Mariam. In the last
three months three land-mine incidents have been reported and one aid agency
lost a truck and a driver.
'It is going to be a major logistical operation to get food in there to keep
people in a reasonable condition,' said Mr Ellis. 'Reduced access due to
insecurity has made the situation worse.'

FT  07 MAY 91 / 'Stop Czech arms sales to Syria' - Shamir
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, yesterday called on
Czechoslovakia to halt arms sales to Syria and to other Middle Eastern
countries hostile to Israel. Prague says it cannot afford to stop selling
arms until substitute industries are in place.
Mr Marian Calfa, the Czechoslovak prime minister, caused a stir in Israel
over the weekend when he admitted during a visit to Jerusalem that Prague
was negotiating the sale of Czech-built Soviet tanks to Syria, Israel's
chief military foe.
In Prague, the newspaper Rude Pravo reported that the government was
considering selling about 100 new T-72 tanks to Syria and some old T-55
tanks to Iran. Last Friday, the US urged Czechoslovakia, a prime supplier of
heavy arms to the Middle East while it was under communist rule, not to
proceed with the sales.
Mr Calfa said his government would rather not sell arms, but could not
afford to give them up, because the Slovakia region relied heavily on the
industry for employment. About 80,000 people work in arms production in the
region, where unemployment is already rising and the government fears
separatist unrest.
Mr Calfa, who yesterday addressed a meeting of the World Jewish Congress,
turned the argument into an appeal for aid to help convert arms production
into civilian production.
'Czechoslovakia is not interested in producing tanks. But we don't want to
break the economy of a region. Conversion requires enormous capital. We need
assistance. I'm here to ask Israel and the World Jewish Congress for help,'
he said.
In talks yesterday, Mr Calfa told Mr Shamir that Czechoslovakia had 'learned
the lessons of the Gulf war' and did not intend that its arms should be used
against Israel. But Mr Shamir said a decision should be taken not to sell
arms to Syria and elsewhere before the transition to civilian production had
been completed.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Bush heart flutter sharpens America's election focus: The
president's health could become a potent campaign issue in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush returned to the White House yesterday after two nights
in hospital behaving as if everything is back to normal. But it is not. His
heart problems have raised, and revived, questions which were not being
discussed previously. The possibility of a Quayle presidency now has to be
considered.
Suddenly the 1992 US presidential election looks different. Before the
weekend the conventional wisdom in Washington was that Mr Bush was
unbeatable, and few leading Democrats were even thinking about entering the
race. But even if Mr Bush's irregular heartbeat turns out to be as temporary
a problem as the White House claims, his health will have become a campaign
issue.
The weekend's events have reminded everyone of the president's age, 66. He
has seemed younger and belied his age by his energetic official activities.
Mr Bush jogs frequently, as he was doing when he suffered shortness of
breath on Saturday, and participates in other outdoor sports like golf and
tennis. He also fishes and sails.
His age and health will now be subject to closer scrutiny in view of his
previous vigour. Past presidents have suffered serious illnesses and been
re-elected, notably President Eisenhower, who survived a serious heart
attack in 1955, during his first term. But expectations about fitness are
higher now.
This weekend's events have underlined in the most vivid manner the old
cliche about the vice-president being only a heartbeat away from the
presidency. Five vice-presidents have taken over from presidents in mid-term
this century, in four cases where their predecessor died.
The Quayle question was the subject of long articles in all the US
newspapers yesterday. The vice-president has not managed to shake off the
popular impression of being a golf-loving political lightweight he had when
selected to be Mr Bush's running mate in August 1988. His poll ratings
remain very low: a recent CNN/Time magazine survey showed that only 19 per
cent thought he was qualified to become president.
Senior Bush administration officials say this is unfair. The vice-president
has been fully involved in decision-making by Mr Bush - certainly much more
than, say, Harry Truman was before President Roosevelt's death in 1945 when
he did not even know about the atom bomb project.
Mr Quayle has proved to be a loyal and dutiful vice-president with sharp
political antennae on such issues as last autumn's tax row. He has made few
public mistakes and is seen by beleaguered conservative Republicans as an
effective advocate of their case in the White House. He also has a team of
talented young, conservative advisers around him.
The other main political result is likely to be that more Democrats will
think about running next year. Several possible contenders have been in
Cleveland for the meeting of the mainstream Democratic Leadership
Conference, but avoided public comment, apart from asking whether Mr Bush
still believed that Mr Quayle was the best person to succeed him. But such
leading Democrats as Governor Mario Cuomo of New York, Senator Al Gore of
Tennessee, Governor Douglas Wilder of Virginia and House majority leader
Richard Gephardt may now review their positions.
Mr Bush was yesterday impatient to return as soon as possible to his usual
frenetic pace, as his doctors ruefully acknowledged. But as veteran New York
Times columnist James Reston pointed out yesterday, perhaps Mr Bush's
problem is not a 'shortness of breath' but a shortage of rest and patience.
'He is physically in motion and mentally impulsive.'
Not only does Mr Bush pursue a hectic schedule, but he has also been under
pressure recently. The glow of the Gulf war victory has faded in recent
weeks as he has faced criticism not only for his tardiness in responding to
the Iraqi civil war but also for handling of military decisions during the
war.
Charges that he was involved in alleged Reagan campaign efforts to delay the
release of US hostages in Iran until after the November 1980 election have
been revived.
The huge media coverage of Mr Bush's heart problem - and the associated
market nervousness - have underlined how much power and attention is
concentrated on the US president. His health matters.

FT  07 MAY 91 / Japanese 'refuse to sell advanced chips to US': Trade
friction may escalate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPANESE companies are routinely withholding their most advanced
semiconductor production equipment from US chip makers as part of a strategy
to dominate the world semiconductor market, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman
of the Senate Finance Committee, alleged yesterday.
Citing evidence gathered in a General Accounting Office investigation, the
Texas Democrat said many Japanese suppliers did not make their latest
semiconductor manufacturing equipment available to US industry.
The allegations could escalate trade friction between the US and Japan at a
time when the two countries are in the midst of negotiating a new trade
agreement on semiconductors. The agreement is expected to incorporate an
undertaking by Japan to increase purchases of foreign-made semiconductor
devices. Talks are due to resume week this in Washington.
Senator Bentsen's allegations could lead to a new trade complaint against
Japan. A spokesman for Mr Bentsen said, however, that he would take no
further action on the issue until the GAO had completed its investigations.
Ten years ago, US companies dominated the world market for semiconductor
production equipment. Today, Japanese companies lead in several critical
segments of the market. In microlithography (the process by which miniature
circuit patterns are imprinted on silicon chips), for example, the Japanese
share of the world market has risen from 39 per cent in 1984 to 74 per cent
in 1989, according to a Commerce Department report published this month.
In the same period the US market share fell from 60 per cent to 15 per cent.
Mr Bentsen was speaking during a visit to Sematech, the government funded US
industry consortium in Austin, Texas. He revealed several specific instances
in which Japanese companies are alleged to have deliberately withheld their
products from US companies.
Nikon , the leading supplier of microlithography equipment to the
semiconductor industry, had limited sales of its most advanced equipment to
Japanese buyers, Senator Bentsen said.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Minding Your Own Business: Making a profit behind bars - The
landlord of a once-derelict pub now in good cheer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO YOU are interested in buying a pub? You find one, in a semi-derelict
state, that has been shut down by the public health authorities. How long
does it take and how much money do you need to turn it into an award-winning
purveyor of food and drink?
For former truck salesman, John Milligan, the answer is 12 years and the
surprisingly small sum of just over Pounds 150,000. From handing over Pounds
41,000 for a partly decrepit building in Great Tew, Oxfordshire, Milligan
has been rewarded with the latest Good Pub Guide naming his Falkland Arms
the best village pub in Britain.
The path from partly-wrecked building to thriving business has not been
easy. At one stage, Milligan faced 14 summonses for doing internal
conversion work without planning permission on what is a Grade I listed
building in a Grade I listed village. Great Tew is so quintessentially
English, it could be straight off a 1930s film set.
He was forced to take out a bank loan to cover a Pounds 20,000 back-tax
demand and for which he is now suing his former accountants. A fire last
month caused Pounds 10,000 of damage to the kitchen and suspended the
Falkland Arms' trade in food and accommodation for three weeks.
After obtaining an engineering degree in Belfast, Milligan joined Ford and
then Godfrey Davis as a truck salesman. He bought a pub in Hertfordshire in
1976. Then he saw in the Morning Advertiser that the Falkland Arms was up
for sale. His bid was accepted at auction. All the money for the purchase
came as a loan from Allied Irish Bank. Milligan retained his first pub and
had Pounds 18,000 of his own money to spend on the new venture.
The Falkland Arms had been shut six months earlier. 'I decided it would not
have been worth getting in a surveyor to look at it, it was so bad. Part of
the thatched roof had caved in. The top floors were all rotten and some of
the main beams needed renewing. Part of the staircases could not be saved.
The kitchens were in a right state. There must have been an inch of gunge on
the walls of the cellar,' says Milligan.
Fortunately, the 2ft thick Cotswold ironstone walls were sound and the tiled
roof above the main bar was in usable, if poor, condition. So within a year,
the Falkland Arms reopened for business.
'What we basically had to do during that period was put in the toilets at
the end of the building. We had to connect them to a private sewerage
system. Then we dug up the mud floors in the cellar and put down concrete
floors.'
It took a year to complete this limited work because 52-year-old Milligan
was doing most of it himself, coming over from his other pub four days a
week. He has continued to do a lot of the work with the help of one or two
local contractors.
He has spent just Pounds 70,000 on rebuilding and fitting out the premises,
including furnishing five guest bedrooms. The biggest element was replacing
the thatched roof. 'It has been done from Norfolk reeds rather than from
straw because reed will last a lot longer,' says Milligan.
The Pounds 41,000 loan has been paid off but Milligan subsequently took out
a further Pounds 60,000 from AIB, part of that to cover back-tax payments.
Milligan says he did not know he needed planning permission to make internal
alterations.
He acknowledges with a wry smile, though, that he probably would not have
got permission to make all the changes if he had applied beforehand.
'Fortunately it has worked out quite well with English Heritage and the
Department of the Environment. Everything is now sorted out.'
The Falkland Arms, with its massive oak ceiling beams, hundreds of hanging
mugs, table candles, high-back settles and 50 types of snuff on sale,
averages around Pounds 4,000 turnover a week. Three quarters of this comes
from wet trade  - alcohol and soft drinks  - rather than food. Of last
year's turnover of Pounds 210,000, the Falkland Arms made a substantial
gross profit of 48 per cent.
Milligan spends a couple of thousand pounds a year on advertising. The pub
started to appear in Britain's drinking guides as early as 1982. Several
live-in managers have been employed over the past 10 years at Great Tew,
many of them with no previous experience. Milligan says this provides good
training for them to move on to another pub.
'I wouldn't want to keep a manager for more than two years or so. For one
thing, it is very hard work. It would kill them,' he says. The present
manager and his wife together earn Pounds 11,000 a year. The pub's total
wage bill is about Pounds 20,000.
The pub sells beers from four breweries including Hook Norton and Hall and
Woodhouse and always has on tap three guest beers which at the moment
include Woodfordes Phoenix and Bullion Old Mill.
The margins on beer are surprisingly large. Low-gravity ale, for which
Milligan pays 48p a pint, excluding Vat, is sold over the bar for Pounds
1.16.
Milligan can extract little discount from the breweries. 'A large freehouse
could demand astronomical discounts on beer. Grand Met would offer you maybe
Pounds 40 or Pounds 50 discount on a 36-gallon barrel. It's crazy but they
are fighting for business,' he says.
The Falkland Arms dispatches about 18,000 gallons of beer a year. Milligan's
wife, Hazel, supervises the kitchen; its menu includes cheese, prawn and
potato pie and lamb in apricot, with main courses costing about Pounds 4.50.
A double room with breakfast is Pounds 40.
A businessman and landlord, Milligan believes the Falkland Arms is now worth
more than Pounds 500,000. That is incentive enough to stay in the business.
'Maybe next year, we'll look to buy another pub.'

FT  04 MAY 91 / Minding Your Own Business: The only system that worked -
Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I'M A chartered accountant and in my practice I have 400 clients. About 200
of them are on computer. I have been an auditor for 20 years and in all that
time I can honestly say that I have only ever found one computerised
accounting system which worked.'
My old friend Godfrey was talking about the problems facing businesses that
do not have qualified accounting staff to do the books  - in fact, most
businesses turning over less than Pounds 1m.
'Hold on. Half the businesses in the UK have got their accounts on computer.
There must be thousands of them. Surely you can't be saying that none of the
computerised accounting systems works?'
'Oh, the computer works all right; it's simply that the users cannot operate
it with the level of accuracy required for financial accounts. I would say
that whenever one of my clients gets a computer, the cost of my audit fee
goes up.
'You see, with a manual set of books, mistakes are easily discovered and
corrected. But with a computer, the posting has gone automatically through
the system in all directions. If I find an error it is a terrible job to
find where it has gone and reverse it out. Between you and me, when I
produce accounts for my smaller customers I just ignore all the computer
print-outs they give me and start from scratch with the bank statements and
the paying-in books. It's quicker.'
'What about the one system that did work?'
'It was an accounts system for a hotel. It did a self-contained job and the
people were able to reconcile it. Let me tell you: if you ever find a
computerised accounts system which works it will not be comprehensive.'
The source of most of these businesses' problems is the nominal ledger. In
computer terms, a nominal ledger package is the simplest accounting package
of all. Most of the different accounts postings take place within the
nominal and that is why it holds so many terrors for the non-accountant. To
illustrate the problem, let us look at just one of the standard accounting
entries  - wages and Paye.
Imagine a typical small business which employs five full-time staff and
three part-time. The full-timers are on Paye and each earns Pounds 200 gross
per week. The part-timers are not on Paye and each earn Pounds 70 gross per
week.
An accountant is running the books and wishes to post this week's wages to
the nominal ledger. He has to prepare two journals. First he must write up
the wages book in order to calculate deductions of tax and employee National
Insurance for the five staff on Paye.
Their gross wages combined comes to Pounds 1,000. Suppose deductions come to
Pounds 300, leaving net wages of Pounds 700. The company also has to pay
employer's NI, say 10 per cent of gross wages. So his first journal to the
nominal will be as follows: debit Pounds 1,000 to gross wages and Pounds 100
to employer's NI in the profit and loss account. Credit Pounds 700 to wages
control and Pounds 400 to Inland Revenue in the balance sheet.
When the week's wages of Pounds 910 (Pounds 700 to the full-time employees
and Pounds 210 to the part-timers) are actually paid, the accountant posts
his second journal entry.
He credits Pounds 910 to the bank account, debits Pounds 700 to wages
control in the balance sheet and Pounds 210 to part-time wages in the profit
and loss account.
In both journals the debits balance the credits, and he has used a control
account, one of the tricks of the accounting trade, to make sure he doesn't
mix up the wages of the part-timers with those of the Paye staff. (Correct
postings to wages control will always balance themselves out to zero. If he
had posted the whole wages bill of Pounds 910 to wages control by mistake,
the resulting balance of Pounds 210 would tell him he had made an error.)
That is the way Paye works for any business that employs people.
When it comes to posting wages and Paye to the nominal ledger,
the typical nominal ledger package gives no help. All it does is ask which
accounts you want debited and which credited. The user is left to work out
which accounts are involved; whether they are in the profit and loss account
or in the balance sheet; which is to be debited; which credited, and so on.
There are many accounts packages on the market, all trumpeting themselves as
ideal for the non-accountant user, but when it comes to such accounting
systems the gap between theory and reality is vast.
Many doubt whether the small businessman could ever produce his own
accounts, and his right-hand person, the experienced book-keeper, is almost
extinct. Certainly there is a great deal more that the software companies
could do to help. The clue lies in asking why it is that, although they
cannot handle a nominal ledger package, non-accountants are quite happy with
a sales or purchase ledger.
Suppose you are using a sales ledger package and you want to record a sales
invoice for Pounds 115. When the 'invoice entry' screen appears you put
Pounds 15 in the 'Vat' box and Pounds 100 into the 'Net' box. You don't have
to work out which accounts are involved. In fact you don't see any mention
of debits and credits at all. This is because the invoice entry option is a
pre-defined journal where all the accounts and the debits and credits have
been pre-programmed in advance. The computer automatically credits Pounds 15
to Vat, Pounds 100 to sales, and Pounds 115 to debtors. All you have to do
is to fill in the boxes.
Pre-defined journals in the sales ledger allow the user to make correct
accounting entries for quite complex accounting transactions such as the
taking of settlement discounts or refunding cheques. A pre-defined
wages/Paye journal would make any nominal ledger package much more
'user-friendly'. Closing stock adjustment and depreciation are two other
candidates, as are accruals and prepayments. When a nominal ledger arrives
with pre-defined journals for every difficult accounting entry, then for the
first time the market will see a true business accounting package.

FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Faces turn green as the green stock fades /
Charting the decline into shareholder revolt at Tace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARDROOM musical chairs at Tace and Goring Kerr, its controlled
subsidiary, comes at the end of an unhappy period in which the environmental
monitoring and control equipment group has passed from takeover candidate to
an under-performing market laggard.
But if Sir David Nicolson, the chairman who is currently being stalked by
rebellious institutions, is to be believed, Tace's assets are being
thoroughly under-utilised.
While some of the shine has worn off green stocks, the company which Mr Jock
Mackenzie floated more than 20 years ago, operates in areas which continue
to grow by 30 per cent a year.
'The company should have sales 10 times bigger than the Pounds 36m it
enjoyed in 1990,' Sir David said last month, shortly after his controversial
appointment and before the institutions resumed their efforts to install Mr
Michael Beckett as chairman.
Tace's strength lies in environmental pollution monitoring equipment and
contaminant detectors. In the US, the 1990 Clean Air Act has stipulated that
companies must monitor airborne particle emissions by size and quantity.
Tace is confident it now makes a monitor that has become the industry
standard, partly because it is used by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Furthermore, the EPA is using Tace's equipment in the joint studies of air
pollution levels it is conducting with the EC in Europe.
Another development fueling growth in the US, where the group derives half
its sales, is the tightening controls on gas emissions from land-fill sites.
Some 50 states have approved Tace's equipment to test emission levels, and
the group says this should enhance the dominant position it already has
monitoring emissions from the pulp and paper industry.
The other focus is contaminant detectors for the food and pharmaceutical
industries. The equipment is designed to identify bone, plastic, glass and
metal in food on production lines that are moving at speed.
Tace says that a number of UK food manufacturers and some retailers have
bought machines to test and that the order book has rocketed because of
fears of liability claims.
The two areas evolved from the 51 per cent-controlled Goring Kerr, which in
the early 1980s supplied equipment to the food industry and spun off cash
for Tace to develop its environmental services activities.
The strategy was to seek niche markets that would be supported by
increasingly stringent national and international legislation, Sir David
says.
An impressive growth of return on capital, earnings per share and cash flow
came to a grinding halt in 1988. Tace stopped making acquisitions for shares
that the market was more than happy to finance and started to raise debt.
The share price, which had been more than Pounds 5 in 1985 and above Pounds
3 after acquisitions in 1989, fell to a low of 130p.
At the same time, Mr Mackenzie resigned as chairman of London &amp; Northern, a
go-getter mini-conglomerate stock of the 1960s, after selling his stake to
Evered Bardon. Tace took over the entire running costs of the L&amp;N premises
off London's Fleet Street, from where, in a corner, it had operated a head
office.
By 1990, despite reporting pre-tax profits of only Pounds 3.9m, the group
was paying Pounds 1.7m in head office costs. Tace recently announced it
would move out of these offices.
Sources close to the company and the proposed new board say the head office
was constantly draining cash from the operating groups and preventing
essential investment.
This process led to severe demoralisation in the operating companies. At one
stage Mr Dick Richardson, Tace's managing director, held letters of
resignation from most of middle management in his briefcase, according to Mr
David Floyd, of Belmont Bank.
Following efforts by Sir David to persuade management that things would
change, most resignations have been withdrawn.
Behind the institutions' move yesterday to remove the entire Tace board and
replace it with a team led by Mr Beckett, lies the knowledge that Sir David
had decided not to remove any of the board that had allowed Tace's costs to
get so badly out of control. Illust. Sir David: the assets are thoroughly
under-utilised

slim prospectuses for the NY sales
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   THE CATALOGUES for next week's big Impressionist sales in New York
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
until last November the most glamorous events on the international auction
calendar - are limp little volumes. There are none of those hardback
single-owner sale catalogues that we had become accustomed to in recent
years, just 'Impressionist and Modern Paintings and Sculpture' Parts I and
II from both auction houses and separate catalogues for Drawings and
Watercolours.
Sotheby's sales, starting on Tuesday evening continues the next morning;
Christie's stages its main auction on Wednesday evening and Part II the
following day. No-one, least of all the auction houses, is looking forward
to the occasions very much.
In Part I, Sotheby's is offering 47 lots in a session which is estimated to
bring in between Dollars 30m and Dollars 40m (Pounds 16.8m and Pounds
22.5m); Christie's has 58 lots with a presale estimate of Dollars 34.4m to
Dollars 46.6m. When one remembers that only this time last year Christie's
obtained the highest sum ever paid at auction for any art work - Van Gogh's
Dollars 82.5m 'Portrait of Dr Gachet' - in a sale which totalled Dollars
269.4m and Sotheby's Impressionists at the same time came to Dollars 286.2m,
it is not surprising that this season's auctions look limp.
It was at the Impressionist sales in New York last November that this area
of the art market was largely redefined. First, a Van Gogh 'Flowerpiece' -
until then one of the most sought-after types of picture - with an estimate
of Dollars 12m to Dollars 16m was bought-in at Christie's when it reached
Dollars 9m; but in the same sale another Van Gogh, a pen and ink drawing
that was much less glamorous, went above its pre-sale estimate and fetched
Dollars 8.36m.
The lesson to be learned from this is that even last November the market for
more specialised types of art held up. This was borne out when a fine early
charcoal drawing of a head by Picasso exceeded its top estimate of Dollars
2m to fetch Dollars 2.09m at Christie's, while a trio of later canvasses of
the type which the artist turned out by the score remained unsold.
The collector-speculators who until then would pay anything just for the
name Picasso had obviously stayed at home, paving the way for more serious
buyers. That is why at Sotheby's the same week Dollars 2.5m (against an
estimate of Dollars 1m) was paid for an ugly but important sculpture by
Picasso, 'Verre d'Absinthe.'
There is evidence in next week's catalogues that, based on last November's
results, everyone - vendors, purchasers and auctioneers - now has a more
realistic approach when it comes to estimates.
Three paintings by Picasso at Christie's next week - all in some way
slightly out of the ordinary - are modestly estimated: the most expensive is
a 1937 still-life (Dollars 700,000 to Dollars 900,000) while a signed pen
and ink drawing of 1926 is even more reasonable at Dollars 150,000 to
Dollars 200,000.
Then there is the case of Monet. At both Sotheby's and Christie's in the
autumn, 'Water Lily' paintings by this artist did relatively well; but a
landscape by him dating from the 1880s which had a high estimate of Dollars
3.5m to Dollars 4.5m failed to sell at Christie's. A much more attractive
Monet of the same period, a view of Antibes, will be auctioned by the same
house next week: it carries a much lower estimate of Dollars 2m to Dollars
3m.
There are five paintings by Chagall in Christie's sale, of which a
dream-like composition of 1949 is the finest (estimate Dollars 4m to Dollars
5m). A Degas pastel of a woman scrubbing herself with a sponge - not one of
his most attractive works - is estimated at Dollars 2m to Dollars 3m.
Among the surprises at Sotheby's sale last November was the success of two
Surrealist paintings by Magritte, both of which exceeded their estimates to
fetch Dollars 1.21m and Dollars 1.75m respectively. These results have
encouraged vendors with Surrealist paintings to enter the market.
Christie's has five canvasses by de Chirico next week, including the
artist's Self-portrait (estimate Dollars 180,000 to Dollars 220,000) and a
large 1927 work, 'Gli Archeologi' (estimate Dollars 800,000 to Dollars 1m).
It also has a fine Delvaux of 1938, 'La Vie endormie' (estimate Dollars 1m
to Dollars 1.5m); a Magritte (Dollars 1.2m to Dollars 1.6m); and works in
similar vein by Yves Tanguy, Salvador Dali, Balthus and Picabia.
An attractive 1940 Matisse of a woman seated patiently at a table, 'La Robe
Persane,' is reproduced on the cover of Sotheby's Impressionist catalogue:
estimated at Dollars 5m to Dollars 7m, it is one of five works by the artist
 -two of them sculptures - in the sale.
A tiny Fauve landscape of Collioure by this artist is expected to fetch
Dollars 700,000 to Dollars 900,000 and one of his still life paintings,
dated 1921, Dollars 1m to Dollars 1.5m. There are three fairly modest
pastels by Degas with estimates that vary between Dollars 400,000 and
Dollars 1.8m and three canvasses by Chagall, of which a 1970 work is
estimated highest at Dollars 1.5m to Dollars 2m.
Two Picasso oils, one of 1959, the other from 1969, are optimistically
estimated at Dollars 1.5m to Dollars 2m and Dollars 1.75m to Dollars 2.25m
respectively; a Renoir still life is Dollars 900,000 to Dollars 1.2m; and a
Miro of 1939 is Dollars 1m to Dollars 1.5m. A group of four little
watercolour studies by Cezanne - all of them with drawings on both the front
and back of the paper - are estimated at Dollars 50,000 to Dollars 100,000
each.
Several less familiar artists are included in Sotheby's sale: Rufino Tamayo,
Joaquin Torres-Garcia, Matta and Wilfredo Lam. Their inclusion among the
Pantheon of great Impressionist and Modern artists is certainly a sign of
the times.

recovery in the auction houses

IT IS TOUCH and go but it seems that the arts world, both auction houses and
dealers, is nursing the antique market back to health. For some, this is the
worst recession since the 1970s; for others it is a welcome re-assertion of
common sense after the speculative excesses of the late 1980s.
In a way it is easier for the auction houses. Although both Sotheby's and
Christie's have shed staff - and profits - they are building confidence by
holding fewer, smaller, sales and rejecting anything stale and over priced.
As a result they are selling on average 80 per cent by value of their
trimmed down auctions.
Many lots are going below estimate and there are more after-sale deals, but
certain sectors such as furniture, silver and glass, where collectors are
basically connoisseurs rather than investors, have sold well, while
unrestrained Italian bidding, supported by the Spanish and Germans, has
underpinned Old Master prices.
British pictures, less attractive to the continentals and with former
enthusiasts, the Americans, feeling poor, are still in the doldrums. Two
important works by Hogarth, the only surviving oils from his famous series
of engravings 'The Harlot's Progress', were unsold at Sotheby's last month
at Pounds 74,000 each. Admittedly they were in poor condition but a year ago
the estimate would have been at least Pounds 250,000 and the successful bid
probably higher. But dealers, their basements heaving with unsold stock, are
reluctant to add to their liabilities.
The auctions for the really difficult markets, such as Impressionist,
post-Impressionist, contemporary and Scandinavian art, have been so
curtailed that London in June, when antique fairs, dealer shows and large
auctions reclaim the capital's pre-eminence as an international art centre,
will be a shadow of its old ebullient self in the auction rooms.
Indeed there is criticism that the salerooms are being too cautious - that
they need to test the market more belligerently to enable confidence to
return. It is the dealers who are showing the enterprise. But then their
plight is often worse - they are not well resourced global corporations,
but, usually, individuals in debt to their banks and desperate to ease their
overdrafts by making sales.
Business reached rock bottom in early 1991. The British Antique Dealers
Association monitors exports for the Government, and sales of antiques
overseas - in cash terms the bulk of trade for most large dealers - were 50
per cent down in the first quarter improving.
But, against forecast, no large dealers have gone out of business. Their
banks are giving them another few months grace in the expectation of an
upturn and certainly there are more enquiries from prospective buyers.
European dealers have come to dominate the trade and the possibility of
movement in the house market in the second half of the year must be
encouraging for the dealers in decorative works of art.
The sectors which showed the most frenzied appreciation - notably the later
Newlyn School and the Scottish colourists - have disappeared from view, with
the holders of such paintings waiting for an upturn - in five years time?
Instead big dealers in this sector, such as David Messum, have discovered
more modestly priced artists, such as the Edwardian Harland Fisher, to
promote.
London's biggest dealer, Richard Green, keeps his masterpieces hidden away
but has stayed busy selling perennial favourites in the under-Pounds 20,000
range such as Russell-Flint and this week unveils the pretty Parisian Belle
Epoque works of Paul Cesar Helleu.
Some dealers are pretending that there is no recession. Harari &amp; Johns
yesterday opened its summer show of Old Masters, which contains pictures
ranking with anything on offer at recent auctions, including works by Dosso
Dossi, Canaletto, Murillo, and Gainsborough. While potential sellers are
avoiding the auction houses, and their uncertain public returns, the
dealers, often relying on generations of contacts, can winkle out
interesting works. Arthur Ackermann is offering a 1760s view by Samuel Scott
of Alexander Pope's long demolished villa at Twickenham which has been out
of the UK for 60 years. It is part of 'The Pleasures of Observation',
covering British paintings over three centuries.
Of course this is an excellent time to buy art. Salerooms - after the
auction - and dealers are amenable to offers. Only those forced to sell will
be offering their antiques but the hard pressed trade must let good things
go cheaply. There are even new operators setting up shop. Art Collection, of
Elystan Street, has been established by ex-City men to offer a wide range of
works of art priced between Pounds 50 and Pounds 1,250, basically for home
decoration. Their prices could look cheap in two years time.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Collecting: A Left Bank rite of spring / Anticipate an
annual celebration by Paris galleries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY YEAR in May the 120 antique dealers who work in the picturesque block
of seven Parisian streets known as the Carre Rive Gauche, just upstream of
the Orsay Museum, indulge in a collective commercial rite of spring. For
five days they set out their best art amid lavish window decorations, stay
open all day and late into the evening and lay on a lot of champagne
(Pommery is among this year's sponsors) in the hope of befriending old and
new customers alike.
The district, which was known for its antiques in Balzac's day, has the
biggest concentration of high quality art galleries in the world. With the
arrival over recent years of contemporary art dealers, the Carre now covers
every fine art speciality from 18th century French furniture  - particularly
well represented - to Directoire, Empire and 19th century furnishings. The
area includes international names in eastern art, medieval and Renaissance
sculpture and furniture, ceramics, Flemish and Dutch masters, carpets and
tapestries, pewter and silver. This year they have been forced to lower
prices because of the state of the market.
The five days of the Carre Rive Gauche are a social occasion and an outing
at which art tends to take second place. Last year Louvre and Orsay museum
curators along with conspicuous Paris socialites such as choreographer
Rudolph Nureyev, actors Alain Delon and Jane Birkin, couturier Karl
Lagerfeld, various Rothschilds and members of the Academie Francaise from
down the street, all turned up to the first night. The partying went on
until after midnight and virtually nothing was sold.
This year's festivities last from May 22 to 26 and 30,000 invitations are
going out for the opening night at which Jacques Chirac, Mayor of Paris,
will be guest of honour. Galleries on the quai Voltaire facing the river
Seine will be adorned with awnings and potted greenery. Traffic will be
banned on rue de Beaune and rue de Lille, behind the quai. And even if
little serious buying takes place, dealers say an event which attracts even
a handful of serious clients is worth the outlay.
This year, as usual, each dealer on the block will display an 'objet
extraordinaire' in his or her front window, a piece of art deemed
outstanding for its rarity, its quality or its sheer oddness - last year
Denis Dervieux on rue de Beaune displayed an 18th century model of the human
nervous system made out of seaweed.
This year, the aptly named Cabinet de Curiosites on the same street, is
offering a 7 1/2 oz (210 gm) bladder stone mounted in silver in 1781 by a
French architect who was blissfully grateful to have got rid of it. St
John's College in Oxford has a similar piece and Samuel Pepys records having
one made to hold his bladder stone for 24 shillings in 1658.
As if to offset any image of frivolity created by the free champagne, many
Carre Rive Gauche dealers are studiously exhibiting details and photos of
works they have sold to museums. Jean-Max Tassel, who houses one of the best
selections of Old Master paintings in Paris in small premises on the quai
Voltaire, is proudly confident that his prize object, a monochrome Vanity by
17th century Dutch artist Simon Luttichuys, featuring human bones and a
skull reflected in a mirror, is unsellable to a private collector - he has
an interested curator in mind.
Neighbouring carpet specialist Galerie Chevalier, meanwhile, also has a
French museum interested in two very rare and very large Brussels tapestries
it is showing from a series of eight entitled 'Fructus Belli' made in 1545.
One is in the Brussels Musees Royaux and three others in the Edward James
Foundation in Chichester.
Galerie Charles et Andre Bailly is showing no fewer than 400 sculptures,
paintings and drawings by one of the lesser known Nabi painters, Georges
Lacombe; Lorraine Norre on rue de Beaune is exhibiting ceramics made by
Lacombe's colleague and tutor, Paul Gauguin, after his first trip to Tahiti
in 1893-95.
Pottery and ceramics are well represented this year: the gallery Back Street
on rue du Bac has a rare group of six Chinese Tang period earthenware geese.
Along the street, Lefebvre et fils is exhibiting an 18th century 'Negro's
Head' wig stand in Nevers faience - the only one of its kind known. Nicolier
on quai Voltaire has picked out two very rare harlequin and Colombine
figures in polychrome Delft, circa 1700.
Exceptional pieces of furniture are thinner on the ground. But Galerie de
Beaune has an extravagant early 19th century Russian sofa decorated with
carved mahogany swans' heads and Galerie Fremontier is showing an
astonishing neo-classical Italian one upholstered in canvas and painted all
over with scenes from Greek mythology.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Collecting: NY art moves uptown / Explore a thriving area of
the Manhattan market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HOMAN POTTERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE MORE and more galleries in SoHo, Manhattan's centre of the
avant-garde, seem to be putting up the 'Gone Away' signs, any impression
that the New York art market has totally collapsed is quickly dispelled by a
visit to the Uptown, Gagosian Gallery on Madison Avenue at 76th Street. It
is a hive of activity and in the beautiful penthouse space there is a
feeling that, like Larry Gogosian himself, the artists he exhibits, and the
collectors who buy from him, one has arrived.
Gagosian, who specialises in Contemporary Art, has been here just two and a
half years. He has irritated a lot of people: 'A few short years ago he was
selling posters out of a shopfront in Los Angeles,' said Time Magazine. He
has mounted a number of well-received, museum-type shows that focus on an
'historic' aspect of Modern art: Jackson Pollock's 'Black Enamel' paintings
of 1981; Cy Twombley's 'Bolsona Series' of 1969 and Warhol's 'Shadow
Paintings' of 1979 are just some of these. A show made up of Sam Francis's
'Blue Ball' pictures of 1963 opens at the gallery, on May 15.
All of these artists had their careers nurtured in the traditional way by
being 'signed on' with a particular gallery which had exclusive rights to
their work. Now Gagosian is selling it - resale art it is called - and some
people are cross. When an artist is dead there is not much anyone can do
about it but when Gagosian exhibits - as he has done recently - 'hot'
contemporary artists such as David Salle and Brice Marden who have always
shown with the prestigious Mary Soone Gallery fur tends to fly.
Gagosian also owns (with Leo Castelli) a gallery in SoHo called 65 Thompson
Street and London dealer Kate Ganz has, with New York's Jamie C Lee, mounted
an exceptional exhibition of drawings from Titian to Jasper Johns at this
venue until May 11.
Gagosian (Uptown) is a good starting point for a tour of the best New York
has to offer.
The Ariadne Galleries on Madison Avenue at 76th Street, specialise in
Classical Antiquities. This is a friendly place with intimate museum-type
displays on three floors. Engraved gems that might date from the 3rd
millennium BC, attic black-figure vases, votive terracottas, bronzes, and
marble sculptures are all featured. Prices range from about Dollars 2,000
(Pounds 1,117) for a small terracotta to Dollars 2m. The galleries
occasionally host special exhibitions: Celtic pieces are being assembled for
a 'European Art of the Migration Period' show.
Down the road Antiquarium also sells classical antiques with a focus on
ancient glass and jewellery ranging from Dollars 500 to Dollars 100,000. If
you are furnishing a Roman villa or perhaps starting a museum, The Merrin
Gallery (on Fifth Avenue at 57th Street) is where you will find ancient art.
On the side streets off Madison in the 60s are several galleries which
specialise in paintings - Wildenstein, Richard York - as well as Old Master
dealers, Colnaghi, Piero Corsini and Newhouse. Old Master drawings dealers
Hermine Chivian-Cobb, Bob Haboldt, Mark Brady and Mia Wiener (all by
appointment) and private paintings-dealer, Otto Naumann, are in the 70s.
Colnaghi and Newhouse both feature special exhibitions with good catalogues
from time to time: a pair of beautiful paintings by Guardi, a 17th century
still-life by Willem Glaesz Heda, a large landscape by Pieter Brueghel the
Elder, and a charming 18th century 'Flowerpiece' by a lesser-known Flemish
painter, Pieter Faes were highlights of a recent Newhouse exhibition.
Bob Haboldt, who has recently set up in Paris, specialises in Old Master
paintings and drawings. He has some fine Dutch drawings including a busy
black chalk 'Scene on the ice' signed and dated 1672, by Jan Van Goyen; a
pen and brown wash drawing of 'A dancing lesson' that is preparatory for an
engraving of 1620 by Crispin van de Passe; and a red chalk study of a
classical statue by the Utrecht painter, Cornelis van Poelenburch. This
sheet has the most beautiful wash drawing of a rocky terrain on the back.
Haboldt also has several attractive 18th century watercolour views of
Amsterdam and a typical Frans Keisermann watercolour of an Italian hilltown.
At Dollars 17,000 this is one of the dealer's more modest items.
For fine furniture, the top places in this district are Florian Papp, Israel
Sack, Stair &amp; Co, Vernay &amp; Jussell, and French &amp; Co. For the most sumptuous
assemblies of furniture, paintings and the decorative arts with an emphasis
on French 18th century, Didier Aaron (on 67th Street) and Rosenberg &amp;
Stiebel (57th) are the main emporiums.
Rosenberg &amp; Stiebel has recently expanded into a second floor and is
branching out into contemporary realist art; but their main focus will
remain 18th century France. Their newly refurbished premises has a main
gallery with smaller 'treasuries' leading off it and highlighting their
current display is a truly exquisite neo-classical chimneypiece from Madame
du Barry's Pavilion at Louveciennes. The piece, in marble with gilt bronze
embellishments, was designed by Claude-Nicolas Ladoux and the metalwork is
by the most famous bronze-gilder of the period, Pierre Gouthiere. Other
rarities include a gorgeous Louis XIV gilded wood carved table and an early
18th century bronze statue of Aeneas and Anchises derived from the marble in
the Tuileries Gardens by Pierre Lepautre.
For antique rugs, Doris Leslie Blau on 57th Street is a must and for silver
there is Shrubsole's further along the same street; Ralph M Chait has the
best in Chinese porcelain; and Frank Caro, E &amp; J Frankel and Bob Ellsworth
are among several dealers who specialise in Indian and Asian art.
In a city where a principal topic of conversation at the moment is the
collapse of the art market, these are just a few of the more specialised art
dealers. None of them show any sign of putting up the 'Gone Away' notices.
On the contrary, they seem to be every bit as active as the irritatingly
successful Gagosian.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Parallel turns on the Essex coast: An alternative to the
crowded pistes of ski resorts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX WILKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUESTION was: can one enjoy the annual skiing holiday without the
inconvenience of crowded airports, lift queues, uncertain snow, and the
contagion of the package tour - in short, without actually going skiing?
High hotels and helicopters allow the rich to get away from us all; but even
serious money is subject to air traffic control and the greenhouse effect.
So I tried a different solution: the Essex coast in April. It may be
objected that one does not ski in Essex during April. But the choice was
based on more subtle reasoning. Discard for a moment the image of pine trees
dusted with new snow, the squeak and thump of lift cables on their wheels,
and the mingled aromas of sun lotion, french fries and socks in Alpine huts.
Consider instead the essential character of the sport, which draws people
year after year with the eagerness of escaping prisoners. The awesome power
of the mountains and the high romance of their inaccessible beauty? Perhaps.
But these pleasures can be enjoyed more easily and with more variety in
summer.
No, the appeal of skiing is different, and in some ways inimical to the
contemplation of Europe's grandest spectacle. It depends on speed, balance
and a perpetual frisson of danger. Skiing has gained popularity because the
technology of plastics, resins and fibre made it easier and safer for the
unfit, the overweight and the semi-skilled ; but the excitement of
controlling gravity and the swing of the skis with a ripple of the body, is
the same as it was in the days of leather and wood.
On the Essex coast, one cannot try ones skill against gravity, but there is
plenty of wind and, instead of snow, miles of unspoiled virgin water. The
action is surprisingly similar. One stands on a board rather longer and
about three times as wide as a pair of skis, with the back straight and the
rear knee bent, while hanging on to a wishbone which supports the sail.
In a good breeze, the effect is between skiing and hang-gliding. The sail
leans towards the horizontal, with the sailor hanging like Icarus below a
wing. The force of the wind lifts him until the board skims over the waves
with a roar of spray. It can go as fast as a speedboat.
But is it the real thing? Can the sailboard offer that afterglow of
satisfaction which captured the imagination of generations of skiers? Is it
not wet, cold and, frankly, unsmart? After a week of spring sunshine and
fine breezes, I do not think I would have traded the Colne and Stour
estuaries for Davos or La Plagne.
Skiing and board-sailing offer variations on a common theme: speed surging
from an elemental force but controlled by muscular skill; the wild impulse
to go a little too fast; the exultation of getting it together and then the
inevitable collapse. A bit like Don Giovanni, but quite respectable and
nobody hurt.
Board sailing, also, has been transformed in recent years by synthetic
materials. So, just as the skier debates whether to pit himself against a
slope marked in blue, red or black (in order of difficulty), board sailors
stare out to sea asking apprehensively whether they dare try the '7' or will
play safe with the '5.5' - the size of the sail in square metres. The
biggest modern sails keep a perfect aerodynamic shape and drive the board at
speed even on days when the sea is a gently dappled green and blue. In
blustery weather the newer small rigs improve the board sailor's ability to
negotiate the waves, just as plastic boots and sharp edges hold the skier
firmly on an icy piste.
So also, neoprene wet suits (and helmets for us bald men) make driving spray
a mere flourish of the seascape, certainly no worse than snow on the
mountain. Nor need board sailing be a solitary pursuit. No-one would do it
for the apres surf, of course. Yet on a fine Saturday morning, the municipal
greensward on Mersea Island's shore is packed with people standing, like
penguins facing the sea, all wondering who will go in first. As in the
mountains, groups form to enjoy the luxury of tired limbs, beer and
exaggeration.
Why then, do not skiers desert the overcrowded alps for the pleasures of the
shore? Partly, no doubt, because the skiing industry has catered so cleverly
for those who dislike the sport, but go for pasteurised Gemutlichkeit and
noise. By contrast, the vigil of the board-widow guarding the Thermos in the
car park is bleak. Then the initial cost can be quite high - perhaps Pounds
1,500 for a complete new set of gear (but less second hand). And a board
sailor capsized half a mile offshore, may admit his sport is rugged.
Whatever the reason, board sailors enjoy one advantage: they escape the
modern skiers' hectic search for new terrain with all the apparatus of
multiple lift passes and linked resorts and ski busses. Unlike the face of a
piste, the sea never looks the same. Its expression is constantly varying
under the influence of wind, tide and clouds. The board sailor close to the
surface feels its subtlest variations. And so it was that on a fine English
morning, with harness hooked on and aft knee flexed, outward bound from
Brightlingsea, I joined the bustling craft at the mouth of the Colne,
squared off for the low shoreline of Mersea Island, glanced at the sky and
thought: 'Gluwein, who needs it.'

FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: Dillie's back in town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DILLIE KEANE is on the road again. Packing her piano, and occasional
accompanist Sarah Travis, on her back she is taking her mordant songs of
post-Thatcherite Britain, and the travails of a post-thirty woman, to the
more discerning small venues of the land. Citizen Keane is at the Drill Hall
off London's Tottenham Court Road until the end of May.
Nothing changes. Yuppies, now 'ageing and downwardly mobile'; a rather
touching Requiem for Mrs T, seen snipping the dead heads off her garden
roses while muttering 'Howe' and 'Heseltine'; and the inescapable nuns,
still come within Ms Keane's caustic but somehow kindly satirical fire.
Perhaps it is time for her to move on. The influence on her Irish Catholic
childhood of Sister Mary of the Angels, here giving advice on sex, obviously
weighs heavily on Dillie but is starting to be a burden to her audience. A
new character, Dorothy, a retired Manhattan fashion shop assistant, was a
more original creation and points to a cosmopolitan future.
There are really two Dillie Keane's - the actress and the performer of heart
wrenchingly sad songs. Sometimes the two merge into one, in 'Dear Mr
Brownlow' where the 35 year old spinster writes a letter that will never be
posted, and 'Ealing Broadway Baby', a revived favourite in which a smiling
through the tears rested actress reaffirms her faith in an unfulfillable
destiny.
The ending is slapstick, with Sir Walter Raleigh confusing tobacco with
tabasco and causing all sorts of problems for Good Queen Bess. Only Dillie
Keane can find fun in soft-core porno movies, with their ambitions towards
pseudo-intellectualism, and her solo recreation of troilism will cheer the
nation, but performing a one-woman show no longer really stretches the
potential in this enigmatic figure, with her hangdog face and her loosely
hidden emotions.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SELLING continues at Birse Group, the construction and property development
concern. Five directors sold in March, and since then the price has held up
well, tempting three more directors back to the market. The finance director
of Birse has now reduced his holding by more than half.
At TIP Europe, the container rental group, selling by two directors earlier
in April has not affected the share price adversely and the same two
directors have completed further large sales. Tony Reiger, chief executive,
has now sold more than half his holding, raising Pounds 285,000.
The announcement of interim results from printing group St Ives disclosed
sharply lower profits, and was followed by two directors' sales. The shares
have traded within a narrow range since the beginning of 1988.
The entire executive board of Ossory, the property investment company, took
up stock to fund the acquisition of the Bovis associate, Intercity Group.
Two directors doubled their holdings. The company forecast a final dividend
of 45p.
The past two years have seen a considerable amount of selling by directors
in Clyde Petroleum, all at higher prices. It is worth noting one purchase by
Colin Black, a non-executive director.
Last week's reported sale of 2m shares in Surrey Group was incorrect. In
fact one director purchased 1m shares at a cost of Pounds 63,750.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Your way to avoid travel nightmares -
Holiday insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DO YOU dream of a romantic evening, sipping cocktails in front of a tropical
sunset? If so, you may also have nightmares about finding out shortly
afterwards that your holiday company, or airline, has abruptly folded.
Surprisingly, many travel insurance companies do not provide cover for this,
and the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) only recommends policies
which do provide such cover.
One of these is Accident &amp; General's 'TravelGuard Gold', which will repay up
to Pounds 5,000 of pre-paid money in the event of 'tour organiser failure'.
If you are unlucky enough to be caught out of the country when this happens,
you will be reimbursed the relevant proportion of your money after your
return.
It is worth reconsidering a policy that does not offer this cover. Some
holiday companies insist that you use the insurance offered with their
package, a practice which the Consumers' Association opposes.
Which, the association's magazine, recommends that you should look for the
following as minimum requirements in your holiday cover:
Medical expenses (for Pounds 250,000 in Europe, and Pounds 1m in the rest of
the world). This cover should include the option of a flight home by air
ambulance. Cancellation or curtailment of your holiday (for the full cost of
the holiday, including all subsidiary charges). This should mean you are not
too much out of pocket if you suddenly fall ill, have to appear in court as
juror or witness, lose your job - although insurers will insist you were in
full-time employment for a year before you were made redundant - or your
house is severely damaged. Belongings and money (for about Pounds 1,500).
Note that the largest amount you can receive on any one item could be as low
as Pounds 200. There is also sometimes a limit on 'valuables' alone, and it
is worth checking up the insurance company's precise definition of this
term. If it includes cameras and personal stereos you may not be fully
covered.
Delayed departure (Pounds 20 or more for the first 12 hours, and the full
holiday cost if you cancel after waiting more than 24 hours). Very useful
for those who do not enjoy the architecture of airport departure lounges,
this should provide cover against bad weather, mechanical failure in the
aeroplane, and strikes by flight controllers.
Delayed baggage (Pounds 75 to cover emergency purchases). Makes it less
necessary to carry all your bathroom kit with you as hand luggage
Personal liability (up to Pounds 1m). There is a minimal risk that you will
be held legally responsible for serious damage while you are abroad, but if
it does happen you will be very grateful to have paid the tiny premium.
Accident &amp; General charges a premium of Pounds 17.55 for the first 17 days
of a holiday in Europe and Pounds 38 for the same length of time worldwide.
Special rates can be negotiated for family holidays, and the retired or
elderly will usually pay more.
The Which cheapest buys, for those with no special requirements, are Pounds
13.30 for two weeks in Europe, and Pounds 31.40 (or Pounds 42.30 for the
retired or elderly) for the same time spent worldwide. Family holidays weigh
in at Pounds 34.50 and Pounds 94.20. Separate policies are offered if you
intend indulging in winter sports or sub-aqua diving. Underwriters
ghoulishly assert that 4 per cent of people who go skiing return with at
least one broken limb. Trekking holidays in mountainous areas can also
require higher cover - for walking in Nepal, you are advised to insure
against a helicopter being called to evacuate you.
A three-month expedition to the peak of Everest could be covered in full for
Pounds 162 per person. Non-technical trekking could be insured for around
Pounds 54 per person for up to six weeks.
You may not have realised that you will not be covered for injuries
sustained playing rugby abroad. Health insurance will not usually extend to
HIV-related illnesses, and insurance against nuclear hazards is not
available on the general market. Abta's advice is to contact Lloyd's
underwriters if you are worried about any of these.
Political risks are the jokers in the pack. Insurers' assessments tend to be
based on the Foreign Office's judgment. Up-to-date warnings are available
from the Foreign Office information office, on 071-270-4129. Reading the
list of countries where the FCO recommends particular caution is a sobering
experience and you are categorically advised not to visit the following
countries under any circumstances: Chad, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Togo,
Somalia and Sudan.
You are advised to take out extra insurance for going to Nepal if you plan
leaving Kathmandu; large areas of Peru and Kenya are unsafe; there is
diphtheria in the Soviet Union; and meningitis in Tanzania.
Other nations where certain precautions are currently advised by the FCO
include: Afghanistan, Albania, Cameroon, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador,
Ethiopia, Guatemala, Israeli-occupied territories, Kiribati, Kuwait,
Nicaragua, Niger, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Romania,
Rwanda, Saudia Arabia, Senegal, Tibet, Turkey, Uganda, Venezuela, Vietnam,
Yugoslavia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Check for the latest information before planning a trip to any of these
countries. Insurance cover may be more expensive, or unobtainable, if the
FCO warns against going. You certainly will not be covered if you do
anything which the FCO specifically proscribes.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Kept strictly under lock and key / A
visit to a vault in Birmingham to see what safe deposit centres have to
offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETER Thomas guides the guest through the small rooms that lead to the
vault, under the unremitting gaze of television surveillance cameras.
'No, don't try and open that door until this one is shut. That's it. There's
the click.'
Here, floor to ceiling, are the locked deposit boxes containing who knows
what. Jewellery certainly, documents, cash, the items that people would
rather lock up.
This, in a leafy suburb and next door to Botanic Gardens, is the Birmingham
Deposit Centre and Thomas is the chairman and managing director of it. The
heart of the centre is a concrete box with 2ft-thick walls and ceiling and a
steel mesh running through the concrete to dissipate the effect of any
explosives attack. Entry to the vault is through a door weighing 5.5 tonnes,
cluttered with combination and time locks, on the inside of which is a glass
shell which itself would explode on impact, thrusting bars into the
surrounding walls. But then, you can not be too careful with other peoples'
valuables, especially if they are paying you to look after them.
Excluding facilities offered by banks, there is only one safe deposit centre
outside London and this is it. Birmingham Deposit Centre opened in 1989, the
first to be built in the UK since the break-in at a centre in Knightsbridge,
London, four years ago. The first safe deposit centre opened at Chancery
Lane in the City of London in 1875. It was a handy place for lawyers and
City gents to put their deeds and share certificates, but there were no
others until Knightsbridge opened in 1981. Since, another 11 have opened in
London.
Safe deposit centres have never caught on in the UK. According to Thomas,
only one-in-1,000 Britons has a safe deposit box in a purpose-built centre.
That compares with one-in-three in Sweden, one-in-five in France and
one-in-10 in the US. He explains the century-long gap in building a UK safe
deposit centre as 'reluctance to take security seriously by private
individuals'.
Birmingham Deposit Centre has 3,500 boxes, of which about 1,000 are
regularly in use. Most of the clients are from the Asian community: they are
familiar with the concept of safe deposit centres and they also like to lock
away the dowry jewellery.
The British, if they have anything to lock away, usually just take the
articles to the bank. Not that the banks are particularly enthusiastic about
a safe custody service: bankers doubt whether they cover their costs in
providing the service.
Charges at banks and deposit centres depend on the size of the box rented.
At Birmingham Deposit Centre, rental of a box runs from Pounds 99 to Pounds
1,350 a year, but access is unlimited and without charge, and the rental
includes Pounds 25,000 of all-risks insurance cover. That cover applies both
inside the centre and outside for 60 days a year.
At Barclays Bank there are three tiers of charge: Pounds 20 for an envelope
for a year with no charge for access; renting a small box costs Pounds 20 a
year but with a Pounds 6 a visit charge if more than three visits are made a
quarter; a large box costs Pounds 40 a year with the same access charge as
for a small box.
Birmingham Deposit Centre and Barclays quote their charges exclusive of VAT.
Barclays offers no insurance cover but holders of a Premier card receive
free safe deposit facilities.
A greater awareness of security needs and more cost consciousness among the
banks suggest that safe deposit centres will spread. Thomas notes that the
number of domestic burglaries in Sweden has dropped since the spread of such
centres there.
A deposit centre can also store computer data: company insurance premiums
are often lower if crucial computer data is stored off-site.
Birmingham Deposit Centre is also talking about a joint venture with the Law
Society for a system of registering and storing wills.
Individual companies are planning new safe deposit centres in Bristol,
Edinburgh, Leeds, Leicester and Manchester, but entry is not cheap.
Birmingham Deposit Centre, 75 per cent owned by Pertemps, the recruitment
agency group, and 25 per cent by the management, spent Pounds 2m on setting
up its facilities.
If there is to be public confidence in the security and probity of such
centres, standards for their operation may need to be established.
A Home Office committee, of which Thomas is a member, is now considering the
possibility of legislation to meet that point.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Moves to cut Pep delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRADFORD &amp; Bingley Building Society has had teething problems with its
personal equity plans, which invest in BP and ICI shares.
The Peps represent a bold attempt to sell shares to the mass market,
harnessing shares in two large blue chip companies to a building society
with many retail outlets. However, the service has not functioned smoothly.
One FT reader had to wait more than a month for his shares to be purchased,
having sent a cheque for Pounds 6,000 to Bradford &amp; Bingley on March 15.
During that time the share price rose by more than 20p.
He was sent no receipt for his cheque and only discovered it had been cashed
when he saw his bank statement. The building society now says that cheques
for the ICI Pep will be acknowledged.
The delay occurred because of several factors:
Bradford &amp; Bingley had to allow seven days for the cheque to clear. It also
had to allow a statutory 'cooling-off' period of seven days before the
purchase could be made. These periods ran concurrently.
The reader already held shares in BP, and wanted to transfer them to the
Pep. This cannot be done directly - the shares have to be sold and bought
back within the Pep before the rest of the purchase can be made. These two
delays meant that a deadline for opening the plan was missed. Bradford &amp;
Bingley only guarantees that the plan will be opened within two weeks of
receipt of the funds by the plan manager. It is only possible to open plans
on one day each fortnight.
Peps need to be held for several years before the benefits of reinvesting
dividends gross and avoiding capital gains tax begin to pay off. There is a
time delay, thanks to 'cooling-off', with nearly all Peps, and they are not
for those who wish to play the market.
Peps are good for profiting from the equity market in the long-term.
Bradford &amp; Bingley offers the option within the Pep of investing Pounds
3,000 in a unit trust which tracks the FTSE index - plainly a package for
the risk-averse.
Investing in equities via the mass market is not easy but Bradford &amp;
Bingley's decision to acknowledge cheques will overcome one of the
difficulties.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Polly Peck mystery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETHING strange is happening to the shares of Polly Peck International,
the conglomerate built by Asil Nadir which collapsed last autumn.
Someone, somewhere, seems to believe the shares are worth something after
all. That, at least, is the message from a recent spate of buying. The
thousands of Polly Peck small shareholders who thought they had no better
use for their certificates than papering the walls should perhaps think
again.
The source of the buying is not easy to trace. The shares are suspended in
London, but institutional and private holders have been approached directly
with offers (often in cash) to part with their shares. A month ago, these
private offers were being made at around 10p a share - compared with a
suspension price of 108p last September. Now, they have risen to around 12p.
There are two theories about this buying: one, that it represents a
concerted effort by a person or persons unknown to build a substantial
stake. The second theory is that the buying is by a number of wealthy
individuals prepared to take a gamble on Polly Peck bouncing back from its
current plight.
Before parting with any shares, investors should note three things. First,
if someone tries to buy your shares on behalf of another person, and is not
authorised to conduct investment business, they are committing an offence
under the Financial Services Act. Anyone dealing with them will not be
protected by the investors' compensation scheme.
Second, there is a very imperfect market in the shares. On the Zurich stock
exchange they are changing hands at nearly twice the 12p being offered
privately in the UK. Third, and most important, there has been rumour and
speculation concerning the planned restructuring of Polly Peck by its
administrators. Next week broad restructuring proposals are published and on
May 24 there is a creditors' meeting.
Administrators have never made any secret of the fact that they hope to
refloat the group but, even if this can be achieved, existing shareholders
are likely to see their interest heavily diluted. Anyone buying at this
stage is either prepared to take a hefty gamble - or knows something the
rest of the world does not.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Damaging effect of inflation
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TWO difficulties have regularly faced those planning for pensions
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
inflation and the effect of moving to a new job.
The 1974-79 Labour government introduced the concept of linking the basic
state pension to growth in earnings or prices, whichever was the greater.
However, since the level of basic pension was low in relation to average
earnings, this move would have taken decades to improve the value of the
basic pension compared with price inflation.
However, even this limited improvement was taken away by the Tory government
which increased the basic state pension in line with inflation as measured
by the Retail Price Index - by no means a representative measure of the
effect of inflation on pensioners.
Thus pensioners relying on the state are locked into the standard of living
prevailing in 1982. Progress has been made by governments in ensuring that
company schemes meet the requirements of employees and pensioners.
The government, as an employer, has set the standards required in its public
sector occupational schemes as a model for company schemes in two major
areas - maintaining the value of pensions against inflation and ensuring
that employees who change jobs are treated fairly compared with those who
stay. The latter difficulty has become crucial as job mobility has
increased.
Almost two decades ago, the government ensured that public sector pensions
were automatically increased each year in line with rises in the RPI.
It also ensured that employees who changed jobs within the public sector had
their benefits transferred in full from one scheme to another and employees
who moved into the private sector had their accrued pensions revalued up to
retirement in line with the RPI.
The overall response from the private sector was patchy so that the
government was forced to take legislative action. Twenty years ago, an
employee changing jobs was entitled to no more than a refund of
contributions.
An employee is now entitled to a deferred pension based on his accrued
service and salary at the time of leaving, revalued in line with the RPI, up
to a limit of 5 per cent. Schemes can revalue at a higher rate.
Also, employees can take the cash equivalent of this deferred pension and
transfer it to another company pension scheme or invest with a life company.
Nevertheless, although the differential has narrowed, employees who stay
with an employer until retirement still do better than those who leave
beforehand.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Wall Street): A quixotic attempt to
lead by example
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE good news this week was an unexpected cut in US interest rates. The
not-so-good news was the economic background which prompted the move.
On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve took Wall Street by surprise and cut the
discount rate - the rate charged when banks borrow reserves directly from
the central bank - by half a percentage point, to 5.5 per cent.
That cleared the way for it to engineer a quarter point drop in the key
short-term Fed Funds rate, to 5.75 per cent, and for the commercial banks to
drop their prime lending rates by half a point to 8.5 per cent.
All this was welcome news to the equity market, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average rising 53 points over the two-day rate-cutting period;
and to the White House, as the Bush administration has been repeatedly
calling for an easing of monetary policy to combat the recession. The US
government spent much of last weekend in a quixotic attempt to persuade
other leading industrial nations to co-ordinate a round of rate cuts.
Beneath the market's enthusiasm lay an undercurrent of concern: many
analysts had expected the Fed's monetary stance to remain on hold, while it
weighed up conflicting signs as to where the economy was heading. So what
prompted it to act now?
The answer seems to be concern over recent statistics showing no indication
of a recovery in industrial production and capital goods spending, on top of
weak consumer demand.
The Bush administration and many economists still say they expect a gradual
recovery from around the end of the second quarter. They may be right, but
not so long ago the consensus was that the recession would be short and
shallow, and it is now in its 10th month. At the start of the year, the
White House claimed the worst of the recession was over, yet figures last
week showed that real GNP fell at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent in the
first quarter, compared with 1.6 per cent in final three months of 1990.
There is still little hard evidence to suggest a recovery is just around the
corner. It is true a very modest upturn seems under way in residential real
estate, while the latest Fed survey of regional economic trends said this
week that there were 'some indications that the decline may be bottoming
out'.
Figures yesterday on the April jobs market showed a surprising drop in the
unemployment rate, but government statisticians cautioned against reading
too much into this. A further decline in non-farm employment suggests that
the economy has yet to reach the bottom of the trough.
Nor are there any glimmers of light on the industrial front. John Akers,
chairman of International Business Machines, warned this week that it had
yet to see any evidence of an improving business climate.
Similarly, the Big Three Detroit car makers accompanied dreadful
first-quarter results with some cautious remarks about the outlook for the
year. Both General Motors and Ford forecast a gradual second-half recovery
for the US economy, but this may have been based on hopes following the
economic consensus rather than concrete evidence from dealers' forecourts.
GM suffered a first-quarter net loss of Dollars 1.17bn (Pounds 690m)
(excluding one-off gains), while Ford lost Dollars 884m and Chrysler Dollars
598m. Large losses are also expected in the second quarter. Wall Street does
not expect any second-half recovery to be sufficiently strong to put the Big
Three back in the black for the 1991 financial year.
Of course no recession lasts for ever and sooner or later the optimists  -
most of the economics profession - which has been constantly predicting a
recovery will be proved right, probably some time this summer. The equity
market has been discounting a resurgence of economic activity for so long
now, and shares are sufficiently expensive (on a 17 plus historic
price/earnings ratio) for the dearth of recovery signs to be producing a
little edginess.
This feeling has been underscored by an enthusiastic response by investors
to certain new share issues, notably a listing on the New York Stock
Exchange this week by Duracell International, the battery manufacturer. It
saw its shares surge to a 38 per cent premium in heavy first day trading.
until the economic signals are more positive, there seems little to push the
Dow much above 3,000 again, but equally the 2,850 floor that has stood for
the past 12 weeks seems relatively strong. More sideways crawling may be in
prospect.

<TEXT>
Unit trust managers are smiling again as sales soared past the Pounds 1bn
mark in March to reach Pounds 1.19bn, following Pounds 1.32bn in February.
Although investors cashed in Pounds 881m worth of units during the month,
net new investment was a satisfactory Pounds 308m in March. Sales in the
first quarter of this year are well up on the first quarter of last year,
while cash-ins are down, leaving net new investment for the quarter of
Pounds 1.27bn compared with just Pounds 415m last year.
The value of unit funds had reached Pounds 56.2bn by the end of March - the
highest level since January last year. Conditions are also buoyant in the
investment trust sector with investments in savings schemes rising to Pounds
26.2m in the first quarter of this year from Pounds 17.8m in the previous
quarter. The number of investors using these savings schemes has now reached
101,300. Eric Short

The FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index, launched six months ago, has illustrated the
sharp rise in confidence throughout European equity markets since the
outbreak of the Gulf war. It also appears to have bolstered London's
position in international dealing.
It has proved particularly popular with investors wishing to hedge their
bets against trends in portfolios of European equities - the London
International Financial Futures Exchange and the London Traded Options
Market both plan to launch traded derivatives of the index next month.

Institutional shareholders last week forced a shake-up in the management of
Budgens, the supermarket chain. A meeting called by institutions - including
IEP Securities, Electra and Gartmore - holding 27 per cent of Budgens'
shares decided the terms on which John Fletcher should leave as chairman of
the company.
The shareholders said they were forced into the action by Budgens' extremely
poor track record. Its share price has dropped from 252p in 1987 to only 41p
by Thursday's close, and the company did not pay an interim dividend in
February this year.

FT  04 MAY 91 / The carrion call: The housing market offers many bargains
for scavenging home hunters, but uncertainties about price create pitfalls
for the amateur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BRENNAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the anxieties of a war and three interest rate cuts this year, the UK
housing strike is breaking. The sellers' market of the 1980s is a memory.
Buyers are returning. Visitors are touring the builders' show houses again.
Homes prepared for sale, but held back a year or more ago, are beginning to
reappear. But the market now presents many difficulties to home buyers.
Where should they start and how can they spot the bargains?
In the past year, the only active traders, apart from those forced to move
house, have been people with the cash and the nerve to treat the recession
as an opportunity to make scavenging bids. As a result, real housing prices
(allowing for inflation) are now some 35 to 40 per cent below the 1988
peaks. As interest rates fall, the vultures are being joined by less
aggressive buyers and sellers. But they face great uncertainties in
establishing a fair price for any particular property, because the gap
between asking and selling prices has become disconcertingly wide. The
reluctance of most English home buyers to haggle is matched only by the
unwillingness of sellers to regard their homes as an object of barter.
This form of bargain-phobia is peculiarly British. Americans buy by the
square foot of usable space and they will pay, or expect to receive, what
the residential price indices suggest. The French take any asking price as a
starting point to bid and counter-bid. Investment purchasers the world over
buy sight-unseen on the basis of a cash analysis of the rental returns. But
the moment a British buyer crosses the doorstep of a British owner's home,
the strain of the encounter renders both incoherent with feigned politeness.
The buyer adopts the restraint of a visitor. The vendor assumes the
responsibilities of host. For perhaps the biggest single personal cash
transaction of their lives, buyer and vendor meet as complete amateurs. So a
common wish to make a deal may often be strangled by cultural reserve and
what both recognise as an invasion of privacy.
For this reason, sales agents prefer to take prospective buyers around homes
without a resident vendor nervously tagging along to see if the visitors
like the wallpaper. When buyers do try their hand at bidding, they are often
so lacking in finesse that the seller is deeply offended and may turn down a
respectable subsequent offer - 'I would not sell our house to those people
if they paid us.'
So how can the opportunist make the most of the latter months of a buyers'
market without leaving a trail of disgruntled people and failed deals his
wake? The first step is to become a cash buyer, by selling his present home,
if necessary. No-one can hunt bargains without ammunition to hand.
The second step is to identify the characteristics of the prey. Agencies put
vendors into three classes: active sellers, hopefuls, and improbables. The
active sellers set a price based on the actual selling price of equivalent
properties. The hopefuls hold out for the premium offered by people who fall
in love with a property. The improbables insist on prices they heard about
in mid-1988 and tolerate a 'for sale' board as a permanent fixture.
Anyone considering a move up-market or sideways need not fear to accept a 20
per cent cut on the 1988 cash value of his house to achieve a sale. This
will be more than offset by the advantage of becoming a cash buyer with the
bargaining muscle to win a 20 per cent cut in the value of a more expensive
property. Because the equation is reversed in a move down-market, sales of
retirement homes have been badly hit. That also explains why so many of the
hopeful and improbably-priced properties are towards the top of the
mid-price ranges.
Holding out for a better price tomorrow makes sense only if the turn in the
market is expected to result in an increase in prices as well as more
activity. But a surge in prices is unlikely, because supply is more than
adequate to meet any likely rise in demand. Every potential buyer who has
been unnerved by the falling market of the past two years is matched by an
equally keen but cautious seller. Those signs of a turning point that are
bringing out potential buyers are also persuading owners to accept that
their home is worth substantially less than it was the year before last.
So the canny home hunter will not be rushed into buying. There is plenty of
time to take careful aim and pick off an ideal home at a good price.
With cash in hand, what should be the opening move? 'First plan your
strategy,' says James Wilson, of the property buying firm Wilson &amp; Wilson.
'The timing now is perfect as the market has undoubtedly bottomed out.'
Finding the right property may take a long time. The buyer needs to be
highly selective because of the large number of poor properties which remain
unsold in a slack market. 'Poor' may be in terms of relative price or
relative quality.
'Valuations have been impossible to make with any accuracy, so asking prices
are all over the place,' Wilson says. That is why the professional buying
agents rarely look at an asking price these days. They start with their own
valuation as the basis for a recommended offer. An individual home hunter
should to do the same.
'Sales 'hype' has changed in the 1990s. Now every property is claimed to be
'realistically' priced, even if it bears no relation to what we would regard
as achievable,' says Wilson. 'Some of the deals we have completed in the
past year were at a third less than the price initially quoted.'
In a rising market it is often argued that the best value is offered by the
cheapest property in an expensive area - to reap the benefits of generally
rising values in a fashionable neighbourhood. That approach now has its
dangers. Cheap property often goes with large and unpredictable renovation
costs, which may not be money well spent in a soft market. While prices can
be negotiated downwards, buyers should concentrate on houses of quality,
whose true value can be asessed more easily.
If asking prices are an uncertain guide to values, how can any
non-specialist expect to know how, and what, to bid? The answer seems to be
that they cannot, on both counts.
For a start, by no means every asking price is inflated. Trevor Kent, past
president of the National Association of Estate Agents, now with an agency
in Gerrards Cross, finds many buyers 'are so blindly certain that the market
allows them to get more off, whatever price a house is offered for, that
they lose the deal'. Bargaining does not mean hammering down an already fair
price.
A structural survey of a property can help the buyer judge a fair price. A
mortgage lenders' inspection and valuation aims to show the resale value of
property in case the buyer should fail to meet the payments. This valuation
is likely to be conservative, however.
Those who still want to shave a few thousand from the asking price of a
property in an estate agent's window, but do not feel up to face-to-face
bargaining, can pay a pre-agreed fee to another estate agent to negotiate.
As Chris Maunder Taylor of North London agents Stock Page &amp; Stock says:
'That is still unconventional in the private sector but it is standard
practice for commercial property and, in this market, it makes sense.' A
private buyer who has already selected a property could expect to pay an
agent as little as a few hundred pounds for negotiating a price.
The professionals judge the vendor as much as the property. Maunder Taylor
says: 'When you go around someone's house it is not difficult to find out
why they are selling in today's market. It might be to get a quick sale to
make a move. It may be that they are under pressure. The bottom line may be
that the bank is breathing down his neck or he must move to pay school fees
. . . usually there is some good reason and you have to put that together
with the survey and valuation information to pitch your offer.
'English people are not often good at this sort of bargaining. It calls for
bazaar trading; street market tactics,' adds Taylor.
The principle is to get a dialogue going, rather than to make an offer which
is so far from the seller's expectation that it becomes impossible to
haggle. James Wilson says: 'Whenever you make an offer it must border on the
credible. One wonders sometimes if people who make offers at half the asking
price are really serious. It may be good for their ego, but it merely annoys
the vendor. The chances of concluding a deal are nil.'
Home hunters looking for the sharpest bargains can take a lead from the
scavenger bidders by concentrating on properties that must be sold. Truly
distressed homeowners are easy to spot. The pincer effect of record loan
rates and declining resale values on heavily borrowed home buyers forced an
unprecedented 44,000 repossessions last year. The Council of Mortgage
Lenders' recent estimate that 123,000 borrowers are now six months or more
in arrears with their payments hints at the number of home owners with
serious cash difficulties.
That figure implies a similar flood of forced sales this year, and plenty of
scope for the vulture instincts of the toughest of home bargainers. However
those numbers do not show the extent of the next layer of struggling owners,
the wider category of 'near-distressed' sellers.
Excluding cash buyers and those taking out less than the average mortgage
advance of 60 per cent or more, about 1m owners stretched their borrowings
near to the limit to buy at 1987 and 1988 prices. Recent rate cuts are too
little too late for many whose homes are now worth less than their
mortgages. These owners stay out of the lenders' alarm lists by managing to
keep up the loan payments, but they would be keen enough to sell and reduce
their commitments if they could.
The number of forced sales this year could be 100,000 or more, according to
Trevor Kent. Many more who have postponed a move - for example, divorced
people living in the same house, those who have moved jobs or those with
grown up children - are waiting to put their houses on the market.
This suggests an even stronger case for handing over price negotiations to a
neutral professional. Home hunters too squeamish to take advantage of an
owner's problems cannot expect to bag the bargains. The hidden mass of
would-be movers counterbalances the frequently described, but yet to be
sighted, 'pent-up' demand for homes. That is invariably misinterpreted as a
tidal wave of buying power ready to crash back into the market and send
prices surfing ahead once more, as they did after previous slack periods.
But past history may be a poor guide. The housing recession of the last
three years was the first since World War Two in which prices retreated in
cash terms. The 35 to 40 per cent fall in real terms suggests a long haul
back for any owners still hoping that inflation will bail them out. Of
course, inflation will erode the real value of their mortgage. Owners may
also hope that inflation will tend to push up the value of their properties
at least in cash terms. But demand is still highly price-sensitive, while
potential supply is held up by the number of forced sellers. In the longer
term, the shortfall of new houses being built, compared with the likely
increase in the number of those who would like to own their own homes, will
tend to raise real prices. Meanwhile bargain hunters have time to shop
around.
A revival of activity now depends on owners accepting lower prices rather
than on buyers bidding each other up into another credit-filled bubble. The
bargains are out there waiting for buyers with cash, and the risks of
selling ahead of any sudden rise in prices are minimal.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Share trading compensation row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is pressing the Stock Exchange to raise from Pounds 50m to
Pounds 1bn the proposed compensation ceiling to cover losses by personal
shareholders through the Taurus electronic share settlement system.
The argument has added to the rift between the City and the Department of
Trade and Industry about the development of the long-delayed electronic
system, which will replace share certificates by entries on computers.
The compensation scheme would protect all losses in any one year by private
shareholders in the event of electronic failure, fraud or error.
Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, sees the higher limit as a way
of winning the confidence of individual shareholders in the system.
The DTI is understood to have based its call for compensation of up to
Pounds 1bn on the fact that private individuals own about Pounds 84bn of UK
shares. Once Taurus is fully operational all these shares will be
'dematerialised', or brought into the electronic system.
The DTI said yesterday that its aim was to secure sufficient protection for
investors without adding to their costs. It said it was discussing with the
exchange a level for the compensation scheme which would reflect this
balance.
The exchange has told the DTI that the cost of insurance to cover a Pounds
1bn scheme would add significantly to dealing costs for private investors.
Most of the premiums would fall on private client brokers.
The exchange has also said it could not buy enough insurance to match the
Pounds 1bn ceiling because there was not enough capacity in the market. It
added that such a limit was unnecessary, as tight security and a daily
reconciliation of all shares held in Taurus would make such vast losses
impossible.
With the delays, Taurus, originally planned for October, is unlikely to come
into operation before the summer of 1992 at the earliest.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Disney's Dow debut no cartoon fantasy

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN A MOVE symbolic of the changing shape of the US economy, Walt Disney
Company is to replace USX, the giant steel manufacturer, in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.
The decision ends a 63-year relationship between USX and the nation's most
widely watched stock market average, whose 30 companies represent a
cross-section of US business.
The steel producer, then known as US Steel, was one of the 30 original
constituents of the Dow when it was first published in the Wall Street
Journal on October 1, 1928. The inclusion of Disney at its expense
exemplifies the changes since that time in the US business landscape.
Where once the average really did represent the 'industrials', it now finds
room for McDonald's, Coca-Cola and American Express.
Disney is not joining the average alone. In the biggest shake-up of the Dow
since 1959, J P Morgan, the blue-chip Wall Street banking group, and
Caterpillar, the world's biggest maker of earth-moving equipment, are also
to be listed. They will replace Primerica, once a canning company but now a
financial conglomerate, and Navistar, a truck maker.
Dow Jones, the company which calculates and publishes the average, said the
changes were intended to reflect the US economy in the 1990s, with the
growth of the entertainment and services sectors.
Since 1928 more than two dozen stocks have been replaced, and only seven
survive in their initial form: Bethlehem Steel, General Electric, General
Motors, Sears Roebuck, Union Carbide, Westinghouse Electric and Woolworth.

Next time the committee meets, it will base its calculations on calendar
1990 when earnings plunged by 60 per cent and profits slipped by a third.
Using the same sort of arithmetic, Mr Newmarch may soon be paying his

The changes that bring Walt Disney, Caterpillar and JP Morgan into the now
rather anachronistically-named Dow Jones Industrial Average should help to
underpin its rediscovered credibility.
During the 1980s, the Dow was stigmatised as a relic of a dying industrial
age. Other indices, with a higher proportion of fashionable technology and
service stocks, routinely outperformed it. Since then, fashion has changed.
Buttressed by the Magic Kingdom, the Dow now looks a more plausible symbol
for American capitalism.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's results from Scottish Television did nothing to alter the
market's view that one incumbent bidder at least will be back in the saddle
this autumn. Scottish has a strong balance sheet - net cash currently stands
at Pounds 20m - and the company is better placed than any would-be
competitor to meet the local programming requirements of the Independent
Television Commission. Scottish shares, which advanced another 10p to 645p
on news of maintained profits last year, have surged 20 per cent since March
when the only declared rival pulled out of the race.
Yet investors in all quoted TV companies will need strong nerves. Fact will
replace rumour in a couple of weeks when the ITC publishes a list of formal
franchise contenders for the 15 independent regions, though most of the
uncertainties will remain. Those companies unopposed, or perceived to face
weak opposition, will presumably benefit from a rapid re-rating.
But under the sealed bidding system, successful applicants may end up paying
over the odds. It is impossible at this stage to tell whether the sector's
average multiple - at a 20 per cent discount to the market - is accurately
reflecting the risks.
Franchise winners may struggle to print serious money. Advertising should be
one of the first sectors to see real recovery, which augurs well for profits
over the next two years.
Longer term, however, there is a big question mark over what proportion of
TV advertising revenue will go to the renamed Channel 3 and how much will
leak away to satellite, cable and Channels 4 and 5. The ending of the
takeover moratorium in 1994 - perhaps bringing in a string of bidders from
continental Europe - may not come a minute too soon.

Mr Kinnock doubtless has more faith in the judgment of the local electorate
than he does in stock markets. Yet the sanguine reaction of London shares to
the Tory setback in Thursday's poll is hardly encouraging for the Labour
party.
Either the market still refuses to believe that he can win come the Big Day,
or it is reassured by the thought that any UK government will have to
operate within the constraints of the ERM.
Since a June election is now almost certainly ruled out, and an October poll
increasingly unlikely, the political element is likely to drop out of market
thinking for a while - perhaps until Mr Major's next misfortune revives it.
At some point, the market will want to see improving economic statistics in
the autumn reflected in the Conservatives' opinion-poll rankings.
Without that, the gilt market in particular is likely to start reflecting
that Labour could still devalue inside the ERM; and its PSBR could easily
outstrip even that of a kinder, gentler Toryism.

FT  04 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Walking the plank at Allied-Lyons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,522.7 (-8.0)
Allied-Lyons' remarkable letter to shareholders shows why the company was
initially so unwilling to elaborate the bare facts of its foreign exchange
fiasco. It is now apparent this was the corporate equivalent of the
Hammersmith and Fulham swaps debacle. Such has been the damage to Allied's
reputation that it clearly had no alternative to telling all and
re-shuffling the board.
The fact that an internal inquiry in the summer of last year failed to spot
any irregularities is the best measure of the inadequacy of its financial
controls. Small wonder the chairman and chief executive felt it appropriate
to step aside. One could ask what took them so long.
In coming so clean, Allied may have been too frank for its own good: the
immediate challenge will be to knock takeover speculation on its head.
That aside - and it might have been more quickly achieved by bringing in an
outsider or two - the biggest strategic question mark hangs over the group's
brewing operations.
Commercial logic says Allied should dispose of its brewing assets and
concentrate on exploiting its retailing muscle. The new management team,
with its retailing background, might be so inclined. The problem is that if
it waits too long, the breweries will fetch much less than today's value of
up to Pounds 400m.
The other nettle is already giving rival Bass plenty of pain. Allied must
find a solution to the inefficiencies of its clutch of regionally managed
brands. The recent failure to pull off this trick in the catering division
is a measure of the challenge.
The real irony of the last few months is that Allied's shares are better
under-pinned than at any time since Hoylake bid for BAT in July two years
ago. It remains to be seen what Allied will do by way of a dividend policy,
but profits should bounce towards Pounds 700m in 1992, which puts the shares
on a reasonable prospective rating of around 12. Investors who think the new
management will pass its test might see this as a good time to jump aboard;
for if it fails, the rewards could be even greater.

FT  04 MAY 91 / US jobless fall fuels recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNEXPECTED fall in US unemployment last month, the first since June,
fuelled speculation yesterday that the US recession might be easing.
The dollar rallied strongly on the news, rising 3 1/2 pfennigs to DM1.7465
at midday and closing at DM1.7495. Bond prices fell sharply as analysts
discounted the prospect of further monetary easing.
The unemployment rate fell to 6.6 per cent, compared with 6.8 per cent in
March. However, the decline largely reflected a rise in self-employment and
an increase in government jobs. Non-farm payroll employment continued to
fall, although at only half the rate of the previous three months.
The better figures surprised markets following the Federal Reserve's
decision to cut the discount rate by half a percentage point on Tuesday. The
Fed, which had been under strong White House pressure to cut rates, usually
eases in anticipation of economic weakness.
Ms Janet Norwood, the head of the Bureau for Labour Statistics, cautioned
that the unemployment figures were based on volatile household survey data.
It would take more than a single month's decline in the jobless rate to set
a clear new trend.
The fall follows two large consecutive monthly increases in the unemployment
rate, which remains more than a point higher than at the start of the
recession last July.
After seasonal adjustment, non-farm employment - seen as a more reliable
guide to labour market trends - fell by 125,000 last month to 109.1m. This
was a smaller decline than expected, but from a lower base. Employment
figures for March were revised substantially - to show a fall of 240,000,
compared with a previously estimated fall of 205,000. About 1.6m jobs (1 1/2
per cent of the total) have been lost since last summer.
Manufacturing employment fell by 40,000 last month to 18.3m - about a third
of the average monthly loss since late autumn. Job losses were also less
widespread.
Mr Richard Berner, senior economist at Salomon Brothers, the New York
securities firm, said the figures indicated that 'the economy was groping
for a bottom'.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Tarmac offers free road in bid for toll motorway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TARMAC, the construction group, is offering to construct free of charge a
dual carriageway north of Birmingham for local traffic if it is allowed to
build a privately-financed toll motorway alongside.
The proposal is part of a bid by Tarmac and Transroute, a large French toll
road operator, to build the first privately-financed toll motorway in
Britain which would relieve the heavily-congested M6 motorway.
The aim of the plan would be to encourage long-distance motorists to pay up
to Pounds 3 to use a three-lane road, which would have only limited access
for local traffic. This would be encouraged to travel at no expense along
the 30-mile dual carriageway, to be constructed at Tarmac's cost. Tarmac
estimates the cost of building the two roads at Pounds 300m.
The non-toll road would be created by upgrading and joining the A38, A5 and
A446 roads. Three-quarters of the route would be completely new road, the
company says.
Two other consortia have submitted tenders to build the Birmingham northern
relief road, one of several road projects identified by the Transport
Department as candidates for private investment.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, is expected to announce the winning
bid within the next six weeks. The other bidders are:
A joint venture between Trafalgar House, the British construction, property,
shipping and hotels group and Italstat, Europe's biggest toll road operator
which manages about 60 per cent of Italy's 4,000 miles of toll motorways.
A consortium led by Manufacturers Hanover, the US bank, which includes
Cofiroute, another large French toll road company. It contains four British
contractors: Robert M. Douglas; Alfred McAlpine; A. Monk and A. F. Budge;
and three French contractors: Sogea; Jean Lefebvre; and GTM International.
Tarmac proposes a toll of about 10p a mile for cars. Vehicles travelling the
full length of the motorway would pay about Pounds 3, thought to be about
twice the level of tolls proposed by the Trafalgar House joint venture.

FT  04 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Late buying helps Dow recover
from jobs news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A BURST of late buying helped share prices finish marginally higher
yesterday after mixed unemployment figures and bad April car sales had
earlier cast a cloud over the stock market, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 0.25 at 2,938.86.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also moved into positive
territory just before the close, finishing up 0.28 at 380.80, while the
Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks rose 0.97 to 492.10. New York SE
volume was light at 159m shares. Declining stocks outnumbered rising stocks
by 760 to 729.
The weak tone in the market was set from the start after the Labor
Department reported that non-farm employment had fallen by 124,000 in April.
This figure was smaller than many analysts had forecast.
There was also an unexpected decline in the unemployment rate during April,
which fell 0.2 percentage points to 6.6 per cent.
Although taken at face value the figures appeared to indicate an improvement
in the jobless data, analysts were quick to point out that the 124,000
decline in employment was still sizeable, and that the fall in the
unemployment rate was primarily due to a rise in the number of self-employed
and government workers.
The job statistics weighed on the bond market, with the benchmark 30-year
government issue falling 1 5/32 to 96 1/32 , to yield 8.227 per cent, and
the two-year note falling  3/16 to 100 11/32 , to yield 6.794 per cent.
An announcement from Ford, the nation's second-biggest car manufacturer,
that late April sales were down 28.5 per cent on the same period a year ago,
added to the market's gloom.
The sales figures may have been worse than analysts had expected, but Ford
shares managed to hold up against the market trend, rising Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 34 1/4 , with the bad news discounted in the price.
Other car makers were also firmer, with General Motors up Dollars  7/8 at
Dollars 38 1/8 and Chrysler Dollars  5/8 higher at Dollars 14. All three
companies reported big first-quarter losses this week.
RJR Nabisco ended steady at Dollars 11 1/8 on turnover of 1.3m shares after
the food and tobacco company announced that its subsidiary, RJR Nabisco
Holdings, would redeem all of its outstanding subordinated exchange
debentures due in the year 2007.
One of the most actively traded stocks was McCaw Cellular, which rose
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 26 3/8 on turnover of 3.9m shares after First
Boston, the US investment bank, said that it planned to sell 1.9m McCaw
shares on behalf of its client, Jordon Trust. Although First Boston would
not confirm that the sale had been executed, the volume in the stock
indicated that it had.
Duracell, which made a successful debut on the market on Thursday, remained
in demand. The battery-maker's stock rose another Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 21
1/4 on turnover of 3.7m shares. The stock had been floated at Dollars 15 a
share.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed slightly lower in moderate trading, having spent the
entire session within a tight range.
The TSE 300 Index dipped 9.65, closing at 3,491.29, for a decline of 6 over
the week. Decliners beat gaining issues 268 to 260, and trading volume of
20,741,000 shares was down from yesterday's 20,556,000. Trading value of
CDollars 242.6m was below yesterday's CDollars 244m.

carmaking deal with Volvo

   THE HAGUE, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Motors, a leading Japanese car maker, has signed a letter of
intent to begin car production in the Netherlands, in a joint venture with
Volvo of Sweden and the Dutch government.
It is to buy a 33.3 per cent stake in Volvo Car BV, Volvo's Dutch affiliate,
from the Dutch government, giving the Japanese company its first production
facility in Europe and making it an equal partner in the venture with Volvo
of Sweden. Volvo Car BV, which currently produces the Volvo 400 series, is
presently owned 30 per cent by Volvo of Sweden and 70 per cent by Dutch
state interests.
The long-awaited move by Mitsubishi Motors to establish a European car
production base will add significantly to the growing Japanese car assembly
presence in Europe. Nissan, Toyota and Honda are developing car plants in
the UK, and Suzuki is to begin car assembly in Hungary.
The three partners - the Dutch government, Mitsubishi and Volvo - plan to
pump more than Fl 2.1bn (Dollars 1.1bn) into Volvo Car BV to modernise its
production lines and to enable it to manufacture a new medium-sized 1.6-2.0
litre car with production beginning in 1995-96. New production capacity will
total 200,000 cars a year shared equally between Volvo and Mitsubishi.
According to Dutch officials, the new cars will be based on a common
'platform' or chassis with separate Volvo and Mitsubishi body styles and
each marketed through the companies' own distribution systems.
The letter of intent was signed yesterday in The Hague. A definitive deal is
expected in September. Under the agreement, the Dutch state will reduce its
70 per cent stake in Volvo Car to one-third by selling a 33.3 per cent
holding to Mitsubishi. It will also sell a 3.3 per cent holding to Volvo,
which already owns 30 per cent of the company.
The transaction will raise a total of Fl 240m (Dollars 123m) for the Dutch
state. Each of the three partners will invest Fl 700m in Volvo Car in the
form of interest-free subordinated loans. On top of this Fl 2.1bn capital
injection, the company will also borrow Fl 500m from banks to finance its
expansion.
Mr Koos Andriessen, the Dutch minister of economic affairs, said the
agreement granted the Dutch state a 'put option' for selling off its
remaining 33 per cent in Volvo Car in the second half of the 1990s. Volvo of
Sweden and Mitsubishi would each buy exactly half of the state's remaining
shares, making Volvo Car BV a 50/50 joint venture.
Mr Andriessen said Volvo Car, the Netherlands' sole automobile production
company, was too small in its present form to ensure its long-term survival.
'If this hadn't happened, I would have had to fear for the future of the
whole company,' he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JETS belonging to American Airlines, the large US carrier, will start flying
out of London's Heathrow airport on July 1, after last-ditch opposition to
its London route sale deal with Trans World Airlines, the heavily-indebted
carrier, proved ineffective yesterday.
American won approval last month from the US Department of Transportation
for the purchase of TWA's three main London routes, although TWA was not
permitted to sell American three less significant routes.
Late on Thursday night, the Texas-based carrier also sealed an agreement
with Mr Icahn, TWA's owner, over the purchase price and closed the deal
yesterday. It will pay Dollars 445m for the three routes - the price it had
originally proposed for the six-route sale. Mr Icahn appears to have had the
whip-hand in the latest round of negotiations, with American anxious to gain
entry into Heathrow by the peak summer season and to shut out any rival
deal.
The remaining obstacle to the TWA-American transaction came from TWA unions,
together with the City of St Louis, the carrier's main operating base. These
parties asked the aviation authorities to delay the route transfer until the
courts could hear an appeal against the DoT decision. Yesterday afternoon,
however, the Transportation Department denied the motion.
TWA, meanwhile, has yet to reach agreement with some of its noteholders,
having missed certain interest payments two months ago. The noteholders have
a right to repossess at least 10 aircraft and some additional jet engines as
a result of the default.
Mr Icahn said he would be meeting unions, St Louis representatives, and
debtholders in 'the next several days to discuss TWA's future'.

The pay rise was decided by a committee of non-executive directors and
includes bonus payments based on the company's performance in 1989, when
profits rose by 9 per cent.
The increase makes Mr Newmarch, who also has more than 600,000 share options

FT  04 MAY 91 / An unenviable record: Allied-Lyons' foreign exchange losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied-Lyons Pounds 150m loss in foreign exchange dealings is the biggest
incurred by a British industrial company. Sir Derrick Holden-Brown, its
chairman, yesterday admitted that the loss stemmed from the use of complex
instruments which the company's financial experts failed to understand.
The revelations came in a letter to shareholders following an investigation
by KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock, the group's auditors.
Although the loss can be pin-pointed to a short three-week period earlier
this year, the root of the problem dates from 1989.
Allied-Lyons treasury team decided to start writing (or selling) call
options on foreign currencies, which give the buyer the right to obtain that
currency at a fixed price. The buyer stands to lose only the cost of the
option; but the seller has potentially unlimited exposure if the market
moves the wrong way.
This initiative was set in a dangerous context. The treasury's internal
controls were not strictly enforced, its computer systems were outdated, and
its staff did not understand the nature of the risks they were taking on.
Sir Derrick, who is to retire early, admitted yesterday that the department
had been 'dealing in foreign currency instruments which were inappropriate,
and in which it lacked the requisite trading skills'.
The writing of options initially proved a profitable business, and,
encouraged by their success, the team adopted increasingly aggressive
tactics.
By the second half of last year, the company's internal exposure limit - the
maximum it risked losing in the market - of Pounds 500m had been breached.
Although the treasury was not officially classified as a 'profit centre', it
usually produced moderate annual profits of about Pounds 10m. Traditionally
perceived by other corporate treasures and bankers as operating a
conservative financial policy, Allied-Lyons had in fact taken trading
positions in the financial markets in order to make money rather than just
hedge exposure since 1978.
Last year senior management received several warnings that the company's
involvement in the foreign exchange markets had increased significantly.
Last summer, the Bank of England brought Allied-Lyons' foreign currency
activities to the attention of Sir Derrick during a routine meeting.
Subsequently, the company's finance director and treasurer discussed the
matter with Bank officials.
But when positions were checked - using what turned out to be inadequate
control systems - it was decided that the company's exposure was not
excessive and that its positions were broadly balanced.
Another external warning followed, this time from KPMG Peat Marwick
McLintock, the company's auditors. That warning, to former finance director
Mr Cliff Hatch, was not reported to more senior executives. Exposures were
still mostly within the internal limit of Pounds 500m.
But in September, a serious breach of that limit at last prompted the
company to tackle the problem. The treasury began to reduce its exposure to
more prudent levels, but during this process it left itself further exposed.
Between February 21 and March 16 this year, the dollar strengthened strongly
against the pound, from Dollars 1.96 to Dollars 1.79. Most of the losses
were incurred because Allied-Lyons left itself with a large and unhedged
short position by writing call options on the dollar.
The market moved inexorably against Allied-Lyons, increasing profits for
holders of the options, who could exercise their right to buy the dollar at
a set rate against the pound, but magnifying Allied-Lyons' losses.
By the time National Westminster Bank was called in to clear up the mess,
exposure had reached Pounds 1.5bn (calculated on market values at that
time).
The systems used by Allied-Lyons to run its positions were not geared for
increasingly complex products. Its computer system had been developed to
handle straightforward foreign exchange trading. The system was amended in
1989 to cover options, but proved too unsophisticated to track these complex
instruments accurately.
This would have been picked up, though, if the nature of call options had
been better understood by staff. Until late February, the trading positions
were believed to be reasonably balanced.
This was because positions were incorrectly assumed to have been set off
against each other, so the real exposure was not known.
Potentially unlimited exposure was believed to be fully hedged by cash
positions, or positions in the forward market. But sometimes positions were
only partially hedged; in other cases, exposure had been increased. As the
treasury traders tried to recover their positions, they left themselves more
and more exposed.
As well as its dollar positions, Allied-Lyons had also written options on
the yen and the D-mark. But the principal exposure was to the
dollar/sterling rate, reflecting - though arbitrarily - the company's
largest trading relationship.
KPMG Peat Marwick is now helping the firm reconstitute its treasury team,
which, following a reshuffle, will still consist of five staff. Mr Timothy
Dalton will stay on as treasurer. A new assistant treasurer is being
recruited.
Other UK companies have rushed to reassure shareholders that they do not use
options, even though options can safely be used to hedge exposure, rather
than to create it.
But when treasuries use options to take trading positions, they are stepping
beyond the traditional role of corporate treasuries, which is to protect
their companies from loss, rather than secure profit.
Such a strategy takes the corporate treasury into the territory of
investment banks, where there are, at least in theory, tight internal
controls, daily trading limits sophisticated infrastructure and expertise in
hedging exposure.
Allied-Lyons will not be writing any more options.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Letter: Taxing property by value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From M J PRITCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I wonder why the government decided to apply bands of taxation
according to value of property. The added burden placed upon those living in
the south-east is self evident and any system related to values will, by
definition, involve the expense of valuation. A far more equitable
refinement of the system would have been to create banding by property type,
eg terraced house with two bedrooms, moving up to terraced house with three
bedrooms; semi-detached house with three bedrooms and so on. The implication
seems to be that those in the south-east pay more for their homes because
they can afford to, whereas in reality I wonder whether expendable income,
having been saddled with the high cost of a house in the south east, is any
higher than that of the north. I am no expert in these matters but I very
much doubt whether southerners have the expendable income of those in the
north.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Letter: Marks and Spencer and a question of philosophy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A L DOWDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The reasons given in your article ('Marks and Spencer adopts a harsh
diet', April 30) for the 850 job losses in Marks and Spencer were sadly
unconvincing.
With the advantages of customer and employee loyalty, huge investment in
information technology and low payroll costs as a percentage of sales
revenue, it is not at all surprising to learn that profits will be up on
last year despite trouble in the High Street elsewhere. What is surprising
is that the cuts should be explained by lame statements about industrial
trends and lack of immunity from recession. Such words cut no ice.
The fact is that these are policy cuts called for by the new hard man at the
top and designed to reposition the company as an employer and with the cuts
go the career hopes of hundreds of bright young graduates, each courted by
the company and attracted by its universal reputation as an employer, many
with several years service backed by further training and periodic
assessment. To move the goalposts at this stage of their careers is callous
enough: to refer to them in as 'a lot of dead wood which is now being thrown
overboard' is unforgivable.
How sad that the new chairman has departed so savagely from the philosophy
of his illustrious predecessor. In 'Don't Ask the Price', Lord Sieff wrote
that 'the improvement of good relations in the working place' was one of
three things he would continue to strive for in the September of his life.
The April of Mr Greenbury's chairmanship may well become the winter of
discontent for the erstwhile flagship of the retail sector.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Everything is still to play for: Winners and losers in the
council elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is some weeks since anyone seriously thought John Major would call a June
election. But that assumption was turned into a certainty by Thursday's
voting. The 6 per cent swing from Conservative to Labour would, if repeated
in a general election, be more than enough to eliminate the Conservatives'
clear majority even though it would not put Labour in full power: it would
get just over 300 seats, a shade ahead of the Conservatives but below the
magic 326 needed for an absolute majority.
However, the shock of the night was the Liberal Democrats' performance.
Everyone, Mr Paddy Ashdown included, expected them to fall away from their
1987 peak. In fact, they not only gained seats but gained more than Labour.
Even though they lost votes in most of the areas where they were a poor
third, they advanced wherever they were the main challenger. Their share of
the overall vote was near their 1987 general election level - and 8 points
above the current opinion poll rating.
It was a three-cornered fight. The Independents continued their long, slow
decline: the Greens elected only nine of their 1,300 candidates; Plaid Cymru
won 36 and lost 14 seats; and a few Ratepayers cocked a successful snook at
the party system.
There are several ways in which the results can be judged:
council seats gained or lost;
changes in party shares of the vote;
councils controlled by each party;
the outcome in marginal constituencies if this had been a general election.
The seats fought on Thursday were last contested in 1987 when the polls
showed Conservatives at 41 per cent, Labour at 31 per cent and the Alliance
at 27 per cent. Yesterday, an Evening Standard poll of polls found
Conservatives and Labour at 41 per cent each, and Liberal Democrats at 14
per cent. The result in seats does not quite match that trend.
The Conservatives' loss was greater than in any year since the Second World
War. But Labour's gains, though impressive, did not justify the triumphalism
expressed by the party leadership yesterday.
The May 1987 votes can be contrasted with an estimate of those recorded on
Thursday (see the accompanying table on share of votes). These figures are
based on a limited sample and are somewhat at variance with Labour's
optimistic calculations from its selection of marginals. When the final
figures become available in the next week, we shall know where the truth
lies.
Labour made an appreciable advance in control of local councils. With
remarkable victories in the long-term Tory strongholds of Blackpool and
Plymouth, as well as in the more volatile Nottingham, Darlington and Luton,
the party controls every large city in England and Wales, except Derby
(where there is a tie), Bournemouth and Portsmouth. Mr Heseltine may find
local government even less co-operative after this week. The Liberal
Democrats' achievement in adding to its local power base was notable. On
Wednesday they had clear control of only three of the 369 councils that went
to the polls. Today they have an absolute majority in 20, including such
Tory resorts as Cheltenham, Torbay, Poole and Eastbourne. They lost the
balance of power in a dozen councils; they gained it in 30 others.
The voters showed some discrimination, for example, in ousting the
Conservatives in Blackpool, or the Labour party in Barrow and Wear Valley.
But the success of five out of the six Militant rebels in Liverpool should
be recorded.
The swing to Labour was far stronger in the south than elsewhere; it was
notably lower in the Black Country. But even within regions, individual
constituencies produced contrasting results. On Thursday's figures, Labour
would gain Elmet in west Yorkshire (with a swing of 8 1/2 per cent) but
would fail in nearby Keighley (3 per cent swing). Labour would gain the
Basildon constituency (6 per cent swing) although it lost control of the
Basildon council. There were swings to the Conservatives in Wallasey (+2 1/2
per cent) and Birmingham Northfield (+4 per cent), and the Liberal Democrats
would win Hazel Grove (on a 10 per cent swing from the Conservatives) and
defeat Chris Patten in Bath on a 2 per cent swing.
Past years offer ample warning against projecting Thursday's votes, national
or locally, on to what may happen in a general election in October or next
June. Harold Wilson, for one, was lured by the local results of May 1970
into the disaster of June 1970.
Liberals seem to fare better at the council than at the parliamentary level.
And the poll tax and health fiascos may not favour Labour so much six months
or a year hence.
Thursday's votes gave substantial pleasure to Labour and perhaps even more
to the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives had little to be pleased about.
But there is still everything to play for in the months ahead.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Leading Article: The aftermath of the G7
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOULD COUNTRIES pursue 'low inflationary' or 'non-inflationary' growth?
That was the question for debate during this week's meeting of finance
ministers and central bank governors of the seven largest industrial
countries in Washington. 'Low inflationary growth,' said the US;
'non-inflationary growth,' said the Germans, with conviction, and the
British with exaggerated piety. The result was predictable: the countries
agreed to differ. But even though the rest of the G7 did not accede to
American pressure at the time, the US is likely to get the interest rate
cuts it wants.
The US administration may have failed to convince the G7 that the world is
on the verge of a global slump, but it did persuade the Federal Reserve to
cut the discount rate by half a percentage point to 5 1/2 per cent last
Tuesday, for the third time since December. Whether the Federal Reserve was
wise to yield to the pressure is another matter, especially given the long
lags associated with changes in interest rates.
The US economy is undoubtedly in a troubling recession with manufacturing
orders and retail sales depressed. But spring has brought faint signs of
recovery. Modest increases in consumer spending and new house sales, a rise
in the purchasing managers index, and yesterday's news of a smaller than
expected fall in employment in April, suggest that the worst may be over.
The risk for the US over the coming year is that 'high inflationary' rather
than 'low inflationary' growth will be the consequence of last week's
wrangling. Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, gives the
appearance of having caved in under political pressure. Even if the cut was
justified on economic grounds, its timing does not add to the credibility of
the Federal Reserve - and in central banking appearances matter quite as
much as reality.
Bonn's resistance
Germany's refusal to cave in to pressure for lower interest rates may,
paradoxically, bring future cuts in German rates forward. At least the rally
of the D-Mark against the dollar, which followed the cut in US interest
rates cut, removed any remaining risk of a further rise in German rates at
last Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank's council. Merely maintaining the
current tight monetary policy in Germany should be sufficient to persuade
wage bargainers of the Bundesbank's view that high wage claims will raise
unemployment. Similarly the Bank of Japan may be happier to cut Japanese
interest rates sooner rather than later, now that it will no longer give the
appearance of responding to external pressure.
France, Italy and the UK may also be able to cut interest rates further over
the coming months. Until recently the strength of the D-Mark in the exchange
rate system, combined with the general unwillingness to countenance a
realignment within the ERM, made such cuts difficult. Since the risk of a
further rise in German interest rates is declining, while the D-Mark remains
weak, further interest rate cuts are now feasible.
UK caution
Whether such cuts would be desirable is another question. The UK at least
must be cautious. While headline retail price inflation is set to fall
sharply over the coming months, underlying inflation appears stuck at over 7
per cent, while pay settlements show no signs of significant declines,
despite rapidly rising unemployment.
Clear signs that underlying inflation is falling are a precondition for
significant further cuts in interest rates. As in the US, there is a danger
that further cuts in interest rates now risk a bout of inflationary growth
next year.
The difference between 'low' and 'non-inflationary' growth must seem
academic to Conservative backbenchers, now analysing the impact of the
Conservatives' miserable performance in Thursday's local elections upon
their electoral prospects. Despite Mr Norman Lamont's optimistic predictions
that recovery is just round the corner, the UK economy still shows no growth
to speak of, but plenty of inflation.
The fancy of a June election must now have vanished from the prime
minister's mind. But economic recovery needs to begin this year if the
Tories are to have a good chance of forming the next government.
The rise in business confidence indicated in the latest Confederation of
British Industry Quarterly Survey suggests that a recovery of some kind may
materialise. However, the recession has already proved very damaging: the
survey also shows that companies are planning further cuts in spending on
capital investment and on product and process innovation over the coming
year.
Mr Lamont held out for non-inflationary growth in Washington. Yet he will be
fortunate to deliver much in the way of growth before the election, let
alone growth without inflation.

FT  04 MAY 91 / On course for collision over car pricing: The row between
the motor industry and the monopolies body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BATTLE lines are being drawn between car makers operating in the UK market
and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission over the vexed issue of new car
prices.
Discussions to be held soon between the MMC and the industry may soften the
commission's final report, which is due to be published by early August, but
the tenor of the MMC's provisional conclusions - sent in a preliminary
report to the industry - suggests that the car makers' powers of persuasion
will be sorely tested.
As the MMC's 12-month inquiry into the distribution and pricing of new cars
in Britain enters its final stage, the motor industry has been made
uncomfortably aware that a tide of evidence is mounting to suggest that
motorists are paying significantly higher prices for new cars in Britain
than in other key European markets.
The industry has claimed that previous studies, such as those made by
European consumer organisations, have failed to take account fully of key
factors that distort prices across Europe such as varying car taxation
rates, differing model specifications, exchange-rate movements, discount
levels, and price controls.
The latest evidence of excessive UK car prices has now been assembled in a
study commissioned by the MMC and prepared by Ludvigsen Associates, the
UK-based automotive consultancy.
The MMC and Ludvigsen Associates have sought in advance to head off the
normal industry criticism by trying to develop a methodology that would take
account of the most obvious distorting factors.
The industry remains sceptical, however. Some car makers' independent
studies, also carried out in the past 12 months, have come to less worrying
conclusions.
The alternative reports will also be presented to the MMC and the commission
will then face a crucial task to sift the evidence - with the risk that the
credibility of its core findings will be called into question.
The Ludvigsen study has sought to arrive at what it calls comparable 'on the
road' transaction prices - both including and excluding tax - for a series
of 20 different models in four segments of the market: small (Ford Fiesta
size), lower medium (Ford Escort size), upper medium (Vauxhall Cavalier
size) and large (Mercedes-Benz 190 size), and in six European Community
countries: the UK, Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Irish
Republic.
The methodology it used to arrive at the transaction prices was to telephone
at least 50 dealers for each of the models in the six different countries.
It was supposed to be a standard approach 'designed to elicit a cash price
for a private buyer with no trade-in'.
The charts show some of the findings with the pre-tax price, adjusted for
varying levels of specification.
It shows, for instance, that the price of a 1.4 litre Ford Escort LX
five-door in the UK (on October 15 1990) was Pounds 6,527 compared with (at
the then prevailing exchange rates) Pounds 6,385 in Germany, Pounds 5,848 in
Belgium, Pounds 5,729 in the Neth-erlands and Pounds 5,453 in France.
The British price was 19.7 per cent higher than the French price.
On the same basis, the British price of a 1.6-litre Volkswagen Golf CL at
Pounds 7,592 was 24.5 per cent higher than the Belgian price of Pounds
6,098. The price of a 1.6-litre Nissan Sunny GSX at Pounds 8,436 was 37.7
per cent higher than the Dutch price of Pounds 6,125.
Some car makers claim that they have already found holes in the Ludvigsen
methodology.
Mr Paul Tosch, chairman and managing director of Vauxhall, says: 'We do not
agree with the Ludvigsen figures. We have not finished our discussions with
the MMC, but on a broad basis we are very competitive in the UK. In some
cases, prices in the UK are in the lower range compared with the rest of
Europe.'
Vauxhall said that its own independent study had been based on invoices of
actual deals across Europe, rather than telephone calls about non-deals.
Mr Tosch claimed that General Motors (Vauxhall is GM's UK subsidiary), with
the exception of a couple of 'rogue' models, had largely stayed within the
allowable 12 per cent price band laid down by the European Commission for
car price differences between national markets in Europe.
The evidence has been collected. Now the credibility battle may commence.

FT  04 MAY 91 / British Gas workers reject strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLUE-COLLAR workers at British Gas have voted overwhelmingly to reject
strike action over a 9.5 per cent pay offer, says the GMB general union, the
main union representing the 27,500 craft and manual workers.
Official ballot figures will not be announced until Tuesday but the GMB said
it was clear from a preliminary count that there would not now be industrial
action.
Unions are likely to accept the pay offer but could still decide to pursue a
claim for a shorter working week and consolidation of bonus payments.
GMB and TGWU general union leaders had previously warned of 'potentially
damaging industrial conflict'.
The threat of a strike at National Westminster Bank was also withdrawn
yesterday in spite of a narrow vote in favour of industrial action by
members of the banking union Bifu. The ballot result, described by the union
as 'non-viable', was on the basis of a low turnout.
NatWest told its 80,000 UK staff last month that it was imposing a 7.5 per
cent pay rise and introducing more flexible working hours.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Labour flirts with reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S coy flirtation with electoral reform made a fleeting appearance at
the party's triumphant post-elections press conference yesterday amid fresh
speculation that it may have a walk-on part in the coming general election.
Mr Jack Cunningham, Lab-our campaigns co-ordinator, who is known to favour
reform, dismissed the suggestion that the party might hint at support for a
new voting system for the Commons before a general election is called. He
agreed it was an important issue. 'To say it is just mutterings and going to
go away . . . neither is true,' he said. 'It is much more important than
mutterings on the side.'
Mr Bryan Gould, the environment spokesman, said that only the Tories
indulged in the 'short-term opportunism and cynicism' of shifting policies
to gain electoral advantage.
Such a comment from one who is sceptical of the benefits of proportional
representation appeared to confirm the view among some Labour supporters
that electoral advantage could be gleaned from dangling the PR carrot.
At present, a Labour working party is examining all the electoral options
for the European parliament, the Commons and the proposed assemblies for
Scotland, Wales, and the English regions. The exercise was agreed at the
last party conference after delegates threw out a proposal by the National
Executive to confine its studies to systems for the Euro-elections and
planned assemblies. A preliminary report is due in the summer.
Opponents of change say adopting reform would show a potentially damaging
and defeatist lack of faith in the party's capacity to win a clear majority
in Westminster. Mr Roy Hattersley, the party deputy leader, also argues that
abandoning first-past-the-post voting for the Commons would condemn Labour
to coalition government.
Yet some Labour PR supporters believe that the possibility of electoral
reform should be mooted in the manifesto. That, they argue, would be
attractive to its proponents and might undermine the Liberal Democrat vote.
Ten years ago the subject was ideologically unacceptable. Now, it is the
centre of a vigorous debate, with many left-wing factions urging outright
backing for change. This week the Labour Co-ordinating Committee, a
soft-left lobby group that often enjoys the tacit blessing of the Walworth
Road leadership, came out openly for a new voting system for the lower
house.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Targeting tactic rewards Democrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS long been an article of the third party's faith that it invariably
does better in local elections than its standing in national opinion polls
suggests. Even so, Thursday's results were well beyond the Liberal
Democrats' expectations.
The party made unprecedented net gains of more than 500 seats, and not only
kept control in their three councils, but won control of 17 others.
Their victories came mostly from councils in the south and south-west such
as Gosport in Hampshire, which had been under no overall control.
Even so, six - including Lewes in East Sussex, Newbury in Berkshire, and
Poole in Dorset - passed straight from the Tories. There were also more than
14 councils where the Liberal Democrats became the largest single party.
The party's claim that 'Labour is not immune' from their advance was not,
however, substantially borne out by the results. The Liberal Democrats
gained only one council from Labour - Wear Valley in Durham - and in none of
those where they became the largest party did they take that position from
Labour.
The Liberal Democrat campaign worked, party strategists believe, because it
concentrated on key areas where the party has a base both in terms of local
councils and in the challenge for the parliamentary constituency.
Such a targeted approach meant good use of resources where it counted.
Losses in areas where the party has been traditionally weak, as in some
metropolitan councils, were more than offset by gains that tipped the
balance of power.
Apart from the targeting, which will also be a feature of the general
election campaign, the party leadership believes that two other decisions
were crucial to the success.
The first was that Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, should
spend most of the campaign on tour in the target areas. Instead of being
tied to Westminster press conferences that were unlikely to gain extensive
media coverage, he generated local and regional media attention.
Party officials concede that the tactic risked leaving the national campaign
exposed, but say that one of the reasons it worked was the Tories' policy of
not matching Labour's daily press conferences.
The second decision was to differentiate the campaign from that of Labour
and the Tories by concentrating on local issues, and accusing the two main
parties of using the elections as just a dress rehearsal for the general
election.
Officials believe that focusing on local issues rather than the poll tax
meant that the party's campaigning was not knocked off course by the
announcement of a move to the council tax.
Mr Ashdown acknowledged yesterday that the localised campaign might make it
harder for Thursday's gains to be consistently reflected in a general
election.
However, he said Liberal Democrat parliamentary victories, such as those in
his own seat of Yeovil in Somerset and the by-election win at Eastbourne in
East Sussex, often followed local-government successes. The factor that led
Liberal Democrats to do better locally than nationally was diminishing, he
said.
The Tories in particular will be trusting that he may be wrong.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Parcelforce aims to cut 550 jobs and raise prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARCELFORCE, the parcels division of the Post Office, is to shed about 550
white-collar jobs by the end of this year and increase prices by an average
of 26 per cent in an effort to stem losses arising from the recession and
increased competition from private couriers.
The programme to improve profit margins by cutting costs and raising prices
is designed to help Parcelforce to break even this year. The division has
gone into loss after making a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.5m last year on a
turnover of about Pounds 600m.
Parcelforce also plans to streamline its network of parcel sorting centres
over the next two to three years, mainly by cutting its large regional
parcel sorting centres from 18 to 12. The Post Office said that would not
affect employment as more work would be transferred to local offices.
Parcelforce is the market leader in the UK parcels market, but it faces
growing competitive pressure from internal private courier groups such as
Federal Express, TNT and United Parcel Services. The recession is thought to
have cut overall parcel volumes by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent. The
division's financial position has also been affected by the corporation's
efforts to focus the letters and parcels operations more clearly on their
markets.
Until this year, a sample of postal traffic had been used to divide revenues
between parcels and letters. A more accurate system for measuring postal
flows introduced this year found the parcels division had been awarded
Pounds 60m more revenue than it had really earned. The transfer of that
revenue to the letters division amounts to a 10 per cent cut in income and a
1.5 per cent increase in the letters revenue of Pounds 1.5m.
The 550 job cuts among Parcelforce's staff of 12,500 will be achieved
through natural wastage and voluntary redundancies, the corporation said.
The price rises, which follow a 9.75 per cent increase in September, will be
introduced from July 1.

FT  04 MAY 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Auditor's view on stakes questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
he did not know of all the holdings in Blue Arrow taken by advisers to the
September 1987 rights issue until mid November that year was 'very hard to
believe', the Blue Arrow trial heard yesterday, John Mason writes.
Mr James Riddell, the former County NatWest financial control director, was
questioned over evidence given by Mr Paul McNamara, a partner with Ernst &amp;
Young, who advised County on the accounting treatment of its Blue Arrow
holdings.
Mr McNamara said that the first time he knew there were three stakes, held
by County NatWest, County NatWest Securities and Union Bank of Switzerland,
was when Mr Riddell had told him on November 16, said Mr Anthony Hooper, QC
for Mr David Reed, the former County Natwest director.
Mr Riddell replied: 'I find that very hard to believe.' Had Mr McNamara not
known, he would have been greatly taken aback when told. That was not his
reaction, he said.
County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and
seven individuals deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the outcome of
the Pounds 837m issue.
The trial continues on Tuesday.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Government expected to sell all shares in Scots electricity
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is expected to confirm next Wednesday that it will sell 100
per cent of the two Scottish electricity companies when it launches the
flotation pathfinder prospectus. The prospectus is also likely to forecast
dividend increases above inflation for both Scottish Power and Scottish
Hydro-Electric.
The government has so far refused to say if it would sell all the shares in
the two companies, as with the 12 English and Welsh regional electricity
companies, or hold back 40 per cent, as with the generating companies
National Power and PowerGen.
The pathfinder prospectus, to be launched by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish
secretary, will include all the relevant information except the offer price,
the proportion of shares intended for non-customer investors and the split
of shares between private investors, UK institutions and overseas
institutions. The offer will be launched on May 30.
The Japanese Ministry of Finance has given permission for Daiwa, prospective
lead manager for the Japanese tranche, to participate fully in a tender
process by which it is planned to sell some of the shares on offer. That
follows weeks of negotiations between Daiwa and the ministry aimed at
getting round securities regulations which had been thought to mean that
Japanese intermediaries would have to sell shares bought in an international
tender to investors outside Japan only. Daiwa is expected to disclose
details of the agreement next week.
The agreement should prevent a repeat of the embarrassment that arose during
the flotation of the generators earlier this year. Nomura, lead manager for
the Japanese tranche, bid up the price of the shares after they began
trading on the market, so they appeared to have been underpriced.
As in the generators sale, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, financial adviser to the
float, plans to hold the so-called 'back-end tender' just before dealings
start in London in June. If it goes ahead, underwriters will be asked to
rebid above the fixed offer price for a proportion of the shares.
The Scottish companies are being floated with higher debt-to-equity ratios
than the English regional electricity companies or generating companies,
with Scottish Power expected to have a debt-equity ratio of almost 50 per
cent and Hydro-Electric of about 45 per cent.
Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, yesterday announced a competition to
find a financial adviser on the privatisation of the coal industry.

MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, was accused in the Commons yesterday of
having 'totally misrepresented' the views of the British Medical Association
on the introduction of contracts for general practitioners, Ivor Owen
writes.
Mr John Cunningham, Labour's shadow leader of the house, claimed that
Hansard, the official parliamentary report, had been 'doctored' to correct
erroneous statements made by the prime minister.
He said Mr Major implied on Thursday that the BMA had departed from its
opposition to GPs' contracts.
Mr Cunningham said the BMA remained opposed to contracts and 'yet again the
prime minister was badly briefed or confused - or both'.
Mr Harold Walker, the deputy speaker, promised to start an inquiry.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Imro orders record Pounds 100,000 fine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR investment companies owned by Hill Samuel, part of the TSB Group, have
been fined Pounds 100,000 in the toughest disciplinary action yet taken by
the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation, the investment watchdog.
The four had admitted 13 offences which together reveal a catalogue of
errors or oversight in their administration.
Hill Samuel said that no investors' money had been put at risk and that it
had co-operated fully with the regulatory body to put right any mistakes. It
added that one unnamed manager had been dismissed.
The offences related to the way bank accounts were designated and
reconciled, the handling of complaints, and a failure to provide Imro with
the proper information.
The four companies are: Hill Samuel Private Client Management, Hill Samuel
Unit Trust Managers, Hill Samuel Investment Services and Hill Samuel PEP
Managers. Hill Samuel could not say how many clients they have in all, but
said they have 16,000 PEP holders and Pounds 1bn of unit trusts.
According to Hill Samuel, the offences were 'procedural and reporting'
failures, and did not imply that its administration had broken down. It said
its offences were:
It failed to designate two bank accounts as client accounts, but had set
them up correctly in all other respects. It failed to reconcile the account
of about 160 unit trust investors in savings schemes every six months, as
required.
It failed initially to tell some clients who had complained to it that they
had a right to take their cases to a regulatory body, although it did tell
them later.
It failed to report the departure of a number of fund managers last autumn.
However, the redeployment of four fund managers from another part of the
group meant no client portfolios were left uncovered.
Imro would not comment on the specific offences, but did not disagree with
Hill Samuel's statements.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Rules on pension fund self-investment eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RULES which would have forced many UK company pension funds to sell property
in a depressed market have been relaxed by the Department of Social
Security.
The DSS has also relaxed rules which will force some funds to sell Unlisted
Securities Market shares, in recognition of the thin trading in many USM
companies.
The changes came to light as Mr Tony Newton, secretary of state for social
security, announced government regulations on self-investment by pension
funds.
In response to a written parliamentary answer, Mr Newton said the proportion
of a scheme's resources that could be self-invested would be limited to 5
per cent, confirming a 1988 proposal by the Occupational Pensions Board.
The principle of limiting self-investment was set out in the 1990 Social
Security Act, with the precise level left to be fixed by regulation. The act
defines self-investment as including any shares in or loans to a scheme's
employing company, as well as any property leased to the company.
Mr Newton also announced rules for disinvestment by schemes which are
already over the 5 per cent threshold. Contrary to the fears of the pensions
industry, he said disinvestment would be restricted to certain types of
investments: listed and USM shares and loans.
The National Association of Pension Funds welcomed the fact that companies
would not need to sell property investments over the 5 per cent limit, as
this could have been disastrous in a weak property market. It also welcomed
a five-year transition period for schemes to sell USM shares. Loans and
listed equities will have to be reduced to below the 5 per cent level within
two years.
Mr Newton's announcement was accompanied by publication of a report
commissioned by the DSS from Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, into the
extent of the self-investment by UK pension schemes.
Ernst &amp; Young reported that, of 6,500 large company schemes, 300 to 500 were
above the 5 per cent level. Of these, 150-200 had more than 10 per cent of
their assets self-invested. It added that forced rapid divestment could
cause significant problems, particularly for property.

<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES have contin-ued to stagnate although sales have increased since
interest rates began to fall in February, according to surveys published
yesterday by Britain's two largest building societies, Andrew Taylor writes.
According to Halifax, the country's biggest society, house prices rose by
0.2 per cent last month. After stripping out seasonal factors, prices fell
by 0.5 per cent.
Nationwide showed a 0.6 per cent fall in prices last month in spite of
'signs of an increased level of activity in the housing market'.
Mr John Hutchinson, Nationwide's retail operations director, said: 'The last
few months have given us evidence that the housing market is stabilising.
From this base we can expect a modest recovery, but not the sort of boom
that occurred in the late 1980s.'
Both societies said they expected prices to rise by up to 5 per cent this
year as sales increased on the back of lower interest rates.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Revival of HK special share plan thwarted

<TEXT>
A SENIOR official in the Hong Kong stock exchange has been thwarted in his
bid to reintroduce special share allocations to members of the exchange's
ruling council. His attempt has renewed concerns about the credibility of
the colony's financial markets.
Mr Philip Wong, senior vice chairman and tipped to become chairman in
October, last week asked the council to recognise the preferential
allocation of shares to council members and to call an extraordinary general
meeting to authorise the practice for future listings in Hong Kong. Both
proposals were passed at a hastily convened council meeting by 10 votes to
five.
The practice, widely seen as open to abuse, was stopped in 1988 following
the arrest of Mr Ronald Li, former chairman, and six other former stock
exchange officials on bribery charges. Mr Li was jailed for four years last
October and faces a second trial with the others later this year for
accepting preferential share allocations in 1987.
The Securities and Futures Commission, alarmed by Mr Wong's proposal,
intervened with the help of Sir QW Lee, exchange chairman, who had been
absent from the meeting. At a second meeting on Thursday the proposals were
overturned by 11 votes to five.
One member who voted against the proposals said they were potentially very
damaging to Hong Kong's image as a financial centre. He said their adoption
would undermine the improvements to Hong Kong's reputation made since the
arrest and conviction of Mr Li.
'The council is the ultimate arbiter of listings. Giving council members
special privileges would make their position very difficult,' the member
said.
Mr Wong has also said for the first time that he accepted preferential share
allocations when he was a member of the exchange committee under Mr Li in
1987. In a letter sent to council members dated April 25, he said: 'I took
up allocations of new listings in several companies in the course of that
year, in numbers greater than those allocated to ordinary members.'
Mr Wong said in the letter that he was making his statement because the
government and the SFC were pressing him to resign from the council over the
1987 share allocations. He claimed the practice of accepting shares was well
known at the time and the SFC, which is in conflict with the exchange on
several topics, was using the information to discredit him. He called for
the practice to be renewed to stop his name being blackened.
Mr Wong worked under Mr Li for several years as a computer expert in the
mid-1980s. Since Mr Li's arrest, and with strong backing from local
stockbrokers, he has risen quickly through the exchange ranks. He is thought
to be considering standing for election to the colony's Legislative Council
as candidate of the Peking-backed Chinese Chamber of Commerce, suggesting he
has good links with the mainland.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Riders on images of reality: Advertising's switch from the
glitz of the 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADVERTISING is usually attacked for making life look artificially
attractive. This week, though, the Nalgo public-service union has been
berated for running advertisements that allegedly make life seem
unrealistically unattractive.
The Nalgo campaign, which focused on public-sector issues such as education
standards and hospital funding, caused a furore among the union's political
foes. During prime minister's question time Mr John Major criticised it for
using 'phoney pictures and fake statistics'.
The crux of the criticism is that Nalgo's advertisements, created by the BMP
DDB Needham advertising agency, used models rather than real people to
illustrate political arguments. One advert showed a picture of a man with
Down's syndrome above the slogan: 'One of the 480,000 people made homeless
last year.' The man - or so the tabloid press told its readers - actually
lives at home with his mother.
Nalgo, which can barely disguise its glee at getting so much free publicity,
claims it simply used standard advertising techniques to discuss real social
troubles. The controversy could be dismissed as yet another bout in the
battle between the political parties, but it comes at a time when the use of
'realistic' imagery is becoming increasingly important in advertising.
Traditionally, advertising has been anything but realistic. Agencies have
painted pictures of an impossibly perfect world - full of middle-class mums
with whiter-than-white washing - to which consumers could aspire if they
switched shampoos or bought a new brand of dog biscuits.
Images of 'real life' mainly appeared in campaigns for public-sector
advertisers such as trade unions, political parties or charities. Agencies
generally used realism in their work for conventional clients as a shock
tactic.
Last summer Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury, which sees itself as one of the
most iconoclastic London agencies, deliberately focused a campaign for Fuji
film on racism and mental handicap because it knew those issues would be
controversial.
Now realism is creeping into mainstream advertising. Sometimes it takes the
form of a focus on the negative aspects of life, as does the Nalgo campaign.
A recent television campaign for Bisto gravy broke away from the 'nuclear
family' stereotype of traditional advertising by featuring a soap
opera-style saga of a divorced couple and their son. The new Kleenex tissue
campaign, which starts on Monday, is directed by Mike Leigh, the doyen of
kitchen-sink television dramatists, and reflects the more mundane side of
family life.
Another form of realism is to use real people rather than models in adverts.
In the past the only 'real' people to appear were celebrities but, in
growing numbers, campaigns now feature 'ordinary' people.
The current Wrangler jeans commercial stars the Rev Bill Shergold, the
motorcycle-mad vicar who founded the 59 Bikers' Club, clad, of course, in
Wrangler denim.
The new Midland Bank campaign is composed of a series of snapshots of
Midland account holders as they describe how their financial fortunes have
fluctuated through their lives.
A recent commercial for Radion soap powder used footage from people's home
videos. BMP, the agency behind the Nalgo adverts, uses home movies depicting
domestic dramas and disasters in its commercials for Scottish Amicable
insurance.
Mr Marcus Hayes, BMP's account director for Scottish Amicable, believes the
growing use of realism is a reflection of consumers' disillusion with the
glitzy values of the bullish 1980s. Aspirational advertising, he says, is no
longer as effective at a time of economic recession and of growing concern
about environmental issues.
Realism may be more in tune with the mood of the moment, but it is also more
vulnerable to criticism than the old school of aspirational advertising.
Some advertisers have come under fire for exploiting social ills for
commercial ends. Fuji was accused of manipulating the plight of the victims
of racial oppression and of the mentally handicapped to sell film. And, as
Nalgo discovered, the question of accuracy becomes highly sensitive when
advertisements deal with real social issues.
As the political parties polish up their advertising strategies in
preparation for the next general election, the controversy over realistic
advertising seems set to run and run.

<TEXT>
NEW South Wales, the only Australian state with a conservative government,
will go to the polls on May 25, Mr Nick Greiner, the premier,announced
yesterday.
Mr Greiner called the election 10 months earlier than necessary because of
the refusal of the Labor-dominated Upper House of Parliament to pass
industrial relations legislation ending compulsory trade unionism.
However, the timing reflects an attempt by the governing Liberal/National
Party coalition to capitalise on the problems of Labor governments at
federal level and in most of the other states.
Mr Greiner will contrast his claim that the state will balance its budget
this year with the virtual disappearance of the federal government's
forecast ADollars 8bn (Pounds 3.7bn) surplus, and the serious financial
problems of Labor-run Victoria and South Australia.
The coalition will be helped by a Royal Commission into alleged corrupt
relationships between politicians and businessmen in Western Australia,
which is damaging Labor.
Labor needs a 5.3 per cent swing to win the 13 seats necessary for victory,
but trailed the coalition by seven points in the latest Morgan Gallup
opinion poll.
Mr Bob Carr, the state Labor leader, will try to insulate the campaign from
Labor's problems elsewhere by concentrating on allegations of false
government accounting, and minimising appearances by federal Labor leaders.
However, his strategy received an early blow yesterday when Australian
Ratings, the local credit agency, reduced Victoria's credit rating to AA
from AA plus, and criticised the state government's financial management.
Labor's problems in other states have helped the Greiner government recover
strongly from a difficult first two years in office, when spending cuts and
controversial industrial relations and education initiatives provoked
widespread protests.
A coalition victory in New South Wales would provide a solid base for a
conservative assault on Labor state governments over the next two years, and
at the next federal election, due by March 1993.

POLAND'S President Lech Walesa yesterday snubbed both houses of Parliament
when he failed to attend a ceremonial joint session to commemorate the 200th
anniversary of the country's first modern constitution.
Instead, Mr Walesa went to the Catholic shrine of Czestochowa for
celebrations traditionally held on May 3. He returned to Warsaw at noon to
attend a military parade and wreath-laying ceremony at the tomb of the
Unknown Soldier.
The president failed to attend parliament against the advice of Cardinal
Joseph Glemp, the Polish primate, and Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, the prime
minister.
His gesture clearly signals that he attaches more importance to the church
and the military as sources of support than to Parliament as an institution.
He is particularly concerned to distance himself from this parliament, which
was elected in June 1989 under a deal between Solidarity and the Communist
authorities.

<TEXT>
A PANEL of economic experts drawn up by the German government yesterday
issued a strong plea for east German workers to tone down wage rises to help
recovery in the former Communist part of the country.
Prof Karl Schiller, the 80-year-old former economics minister, who yesterday
re-emerged before the press as the chairman of a Strategy Forum on east
Germany, said 'moral suasion' was needed to curb wage rises in the east.
The Forum, set up by Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, concluded
at its first meeting yesterday that high wages in the east were contributing
to mass unemployment.
Repeated calls from business and economic leaders for wage moderation have
fallen upon deaf ears in both east and west. Warning strikes in the west
German metalworking industry continued yesterday in pursuit of a 10 per cent
pay claim with 120,000 workers downing tools for short periods.
The stoppages, concentrated in the north and south-west of the country, were
more limited than earlier in the week. But the metalworkers' action was
supplemented by isolated stoppages yesterday in the printing industry, where
workers are stepping up pressure for an 11 per cent pay increase.
Mr Mollemann today meets union leaders in east Germany. He will tell them
the share of wages and salaries in east German gross domestic product - at
60 per cent last year - was much higher than the 45 per cent in west
Germany.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, under pressure from within the Bonn coalition over
his party's waning electoral fortunes, yesterday remained defiant after
cancelling a planned meeting with Bavarian party leaders.
The Bavarian Christian Social Union, which has lately stepped up criticism
of Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats, meanwhile signalled a more conciliatory
tone to limit the damage from the coalition squabble.

CONGRESSIONAL criticism of President George Bush's handling of the Iraqi
civil war increased yesterday as House committees approved more than Dollars
550m (Pounds 325m) for US relief operations for Kurdish refugees.
The funds approved by House appropriations committees (Dollars 321m for
military costs and Dollars 235m for refugee and disaster assistance) are for
use only until the end of this month, thus putting pressure on the Bush
administration to carry out its planned withdrawal from Iraq.
The initial US attitude of non-involvement has been criticised by a staff
report for the Senate foreign relations committee. Mr Peter Galbraith, a
senior adviser to Mr Claiborne Pell, Democratic chairman of the committee,
argues that the US may have lost an opportunity to overthrow Saddam Hussein
in mid-March, in large part because it had no contacts with the Iraqi
opposition.
Mr Galbraith says that as the anti-Saddam rebellion gained force in
mid-March, 'several strategically located Iraqi military figures were in
contact with the joint action committee of the combined Iraqi opposition.
'According to opposition sources, these leaders looked for a signal that the
US supported the rebellion. Not only was no signal given, but the public
snub of the Iraqi opposition combined with background statements that the
administration sought a military, not a popular, alternative to Saddam
Hussein, served to deter defections to the rebellion, helping to doom the
anti-Saddam cause'.
The White House said yesterday anybody who wanted to change sides was
welcome to do so.

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXXON last night withdrew from a proposed Dollars 1bn (Pounds 590m)
settlement stemming from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster.
The oil company's decision followed votes by the Alaska state House of
Representatives on Thursday rejecting the settlement of civil claims as
inadequate. Last week a federal judge also rejected the Dollars 100m
criminal penalty portion of the settlement.
The company provided no details in its one-sentence announcement of the
termination.
The Alaska legislature had wanted to speed up payments that Exxon had to
make to the state to compensate for environmental damage caused by the worst
oil spill in US history. It had also wanted to increase the amounts the oil
company had to pay in criminal penalties.
Exxon's withdrawal from the settlement could, however, delay any payments to
the state of Alaska. The environmental damages case may now go to trial
unless an alternative settlement can be reached.
Eleven million gallons of crude oil spilled into the waters of Prince
William Sound in Alaska two years ago when the Exxon Valdez tanker ran
aground.
The spill killed thousands of sea birds, animals and fish as well as
disrupting the economy of the region. Exxon has already been forced to
undertake a multi-billion dollar operation to remove oil from the sea and
shorelines.
The Alaskan lawmakers had objected to provisions that would allow Exxon to
pay Dollars 900m in damages to the state over the next 11 years. Instead,
they have been seeking a Dollars 700m payment within a year, which they say
would allow the state to immediately undertake environmental restoration
projects.

SPAIN has snubbed EC attempts to get north-south economic disparities within
the Community off the agenda for European union, by re-presenting its ideas
for an equalising budgetary fund on federal lines.
Madrid's renewed bid for more money for the EC's laggards 'greatly
complicates' the already difficult negotiations being conducted on economic,
monetary, and political union, senior EC officials and diplomats said
yesterday.
In a hardened version of the ideas it put to the inter-governmental
conference (IGC) on political union in early March. Spain is insisting on:
An 'inter-state compensation fund' to invest in 'physical and human capital'
in those EC members whose gross domestic product per capita is below 90 per
cent of the EC average.
A progressive system of taxation for the EC budget, with contributions by
member states measured by their 'relative prosperity';
A change in policy for aid to backward regions, which would loosen member
governments' current obligations to contribute to the financing of EC-backed
projects, instead matching this to their 'financial capacity'.
Madrid's proposals for revising the Treaty of Rome were re-submitted to the
IGC on Thursday, as Spain's price for agreement on the economic and monetary
union accord.
A compromise suggested by the Luxembourg presidency was last week dismissed
as 'unacceptable' by a senior Spanish official.
Unlike its poorer colleagues at the bottom of the EC development division -
Ireland, Portugal and Greece - Spain gets little out of the EC budget in net
terms. In 1989 it put in Ecu3.6bn (Pounds 2.5bn) and got back Ecu3.5bn.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Closure of Turkish border curbs flow of aid to refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY closed its main border route into Iraq for more than three hours
yesterday, cutting the overland flow of allied relief to Kurdish refugees in
the region, US military officials confirmed.
The reduction in the flow of aid came as hundreds of Iraqi troops withdrew
from northern Iraq, fleeing an expanded allied security zone established to
protect thousands of returning Kurds.
Closure of the border followed Turkey's decision to expel a British reporter
whom it accused of 'biased' reporting. The article by Mr Robert Fisk,
correspondent of The Independent, alleged that Turkish troops were stealing
supplies.
In Ankara, Mr Morton Abramowitz, US ambassador to Turkey, sought to play
down the border closure.
He said the problem was caused by Turkish construction workers, due to enter
northern Iraq to work on setting up allied refugee camps. They arrived
without proper documentation, he said.
The incidents came after a rise in tension between Turkey and the allied
forces working to move hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurdish refugees back
to their homes. This appears to reflect anger felt by Turkey's military over
its loss of control of operations in its own territory.
In Brussels, the EC and the British government announced they were to
co-finance 20 'mobile support teams' to help Kurdish refugees.
Volunteers from the UK's fire and ambulance services, hospitals and
Territorial Army, are to be deployed for three months, financed by Ecu2m
(Pounds 1.39m) from Brussels and Ecu0.9m from London.
In New York, the UN took the first formal step to obtain payment of
compensation by Iraq under the ceasefire terms, creating a special fund to
be financed from the country's oil revenues. But in a report to the Security
Council, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, secretary general, acknowledged that
ensuring financing for this compensation fund would be among the most
technical and difficult tasks to be undertaken by its proposed commission of
experts.
Meanwhile, the Security Council's sanctions committee ruled yesterday that
individual governments could unfreeze Iraqi assets, if they wished, to
enable Baghdad to buy food. But it withheld a decision on an earlier Iraqi
request to to sell nearly Dollars 1bn of oil.
The UN ruling is unlikely to make any immediate impact. None of the major
players are expected to unfreeze Iraqi assets in the near future.
The Security Council gave no immediate reaction to an Iraqi request
yesterday to delay its war reparation payments for at least five years.
Iran swamped by over 1m Iraqi refugees, said yesterday foreign countries had
sent just six tonnes of food - five grammes per refugee - in response to its
appeals for help.  Some of the food was rotten and had to be destroyed.
Iran was compiling a list of countries who had sent such aid, for which the
world should be ashamed.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Lib Dem support surgesin first big test for Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday sought to shrug off a dismal Conservative
performance in the local elections as the results appeared to leave wide
open the outcome of the general election due by the middle of next year.
In the first widespread test of public opinion since Mr Major became prime
minister, a surge in Liberal Democrat support contributed to Tory net losses
of more than 850 seats and losses of control in more than 40 councils.
Labour demanded an instant general election, claiming that a similar
performance would give it a narrow overall majority in the House of Commons.
Some independent analyses pointed towards a hung parliament.
Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, confirmed that there would be no
June election, saying he had been 'pouring buckets of cold water on that
particular idea for months now.'
The final results saw Liberal Democrats jubilant at net gains of more than
500 seats, as they added 17 new councils to the three on which they kept
control. They had particular successes in Tory-dominated areas in the south
and south-west.
For the first time since the early 1980s Labour made considerable inroads
into Conservative strongholds in the south, where their gains included
taking control of Plymouth, Luton and Kingswood. They also made gains in key
areas of the midlands and the north-west.
Ministers regard the autumn as the earliest election date and have not ruled
out the long haul to next year.
In a brief exchange with reporters Mr Major described the results as
'disappointing but bearable.' He said that Labour had not done enough to win
an overall majority, adding: 'We are on an upswing and I think they have
peaked.'
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrats' leader, called his party's results
'a stunning achievement'. The Liberal Democrats were the only party on an
upward trend, he said.
He, too, claimed that Labour could not win an overall majority, and
confirmed that the price for his party's support in the event of a hung
parliament would be a clear commitment to legislating for proportional
representation within the lifetime of a parliament.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, said his party's advances in the
'battleground' seats showed it was 'the only party that can, and will, beat
the Conservative government.'
Labour's analysis of the local election results in 87 marginal
constituencies indicated a narrow overall majority of five parliamentary
seats. It showed Labour with a six-point lead over the Tories, on 43 per
cent and 37 per cent respectively. The Liberal Democrats were put at 17 per
cent. Tories took comfort from national opinion polls, showing them
neck-and-neck with Labour. Their analysis of marginal seats showed them just
ahead on 38 per cent to Labour's 37 per cent, with the Liberal Democrats on
20 per cent.
Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, was almost alone in claiming a
'dramatic recovery' in Tory fortunes, but his comments also highlighted the
line the party will emphasise over the summer. 'We all know inflation is
about to come down and interest rates will follow it. If the Labour party
have not made the breakthrough now, there isn't any chance of them making it
when things get better.'
Mr Patten plans to move on to the offensive after this month's Monmouth
by-election, which Tories concede they might lose. With the May retail price
index set to show a drop of two points in the inflation rate, the Tories
believe that improving economic circumstances will allow them to re-gain the
political initiative.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Cyclone may claim more victims in long wait for relief
</HEADLINE>

THOUSANDS of people ma-rooned in Bangladesh's coastal areas could die in the
next few days because of inadequate relief operations following the cyclone
which struck the country on Monday.
About 10m people were yesterday waiting for urgently needed supplies of
food, drinking water and medicines as a token relief effort was initiated by
countries including the US, Britain, India and Saudi Arabia.
Relief is difficult to arrange as Chittagong port and airport are not fully
operational. Chittagong itself is a ghost city. Millions of trees that gave
it its famed green canopy have been swept away. A few are now just stilts,
devoid of branches.
The hinterland of Chittagong and Cox's Bazar - the area most seriously
affected by the cyclone - are inaccessible by both sea and road. Millions of
people are stranded in these areas. Eyewitnesses say thousands of naked
survivors are frantically waving at passing helicopters.
Other reports trickling into Dhaka, the capital, suggest that hundreds of
thousands of hectares of land in the coastal regions and nearby islands have
been devastated by the six-hour cyclone. As many as 100,000 people are
estimated to have died.
The cyclone destroyed thousands of dwellings, engulfed all wells and
drinking water supplies, and destroyed crops ready to be harvested. In many
areas there is no sign whatever of any habitation.
Vast stretches of land are under six or seven feet of saline water, in which
thousands of corpses and carcasses of cattle are putrifying, adding to the
danger of disease. The stench is overpowering.
As the Bangladesh government launched its own relief operation, appeals went
out for an international effort if further disaster is to be averted.
Six helicopters are dropping drinking water and medicines which will reach
just one-tenth of the people seeking help. These people are threatened by
epidemics, and diarrhoea has already claimed several hundred lives.
In a special parliamentary debate yesterday on the disaster, Mrs Khaleda
Zia, Bangladesh's prime minister, admitted that transport problems and
continuing bad weather were hampering relief operations.
She declared 'a day of mourning' for today and appealed to all political
parties to jointly work for the victims.
Many members, including Sherikh Hasina, the opposition leader, were critical
of the government's efforts to help the victims.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Allied-Lyons shake-upreceives cautious welcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDE-RANGING management changes at Allied-Lyons, the UK drinks and food
group, yesterday received a cautious welcome in the City.
The moves, involving the early departure of the chairman and chief
executive, came in an effort to repair damage to investor confidence caused
by losses of Pounds 147m on the group's foreign exchange trading.
Analysts suggested, however, that the shake-up may not be enough to ease
concern entirely or to damp speculation about a takeover bid. One analyst
said the changes were 'the least that could be done'.
There has been heavy trading in Allied's shares in the past week amid
rumours of possible predators for the Pounds 4bn group. The shares dropped
9p to 552p yesterday but were still 32p up on the week.
Leading the changes, Sir Derrick Holden-Brown, chairman, has accepted
'ultimate responsibility' for inadequate management controls over the
group's foreign currency dealings and will retire a year early in July. Mr
Richard Martin will give up his post as chief executive.
Mr Michael Jackaman, architect of the group's successful wine and spirits
division, will take over as chairman, and Mr Tony Hales, head of the J Lyons
food division for the past two years, will become chief executive.
Recruitment of a prominent outsider to one of these posts would have
restored confidence more quickly, analysts suggested, although a finance
director will be brought in from outside to succeed Mr Cliff Hatch, who
resigned in March.
There was recognition of Mr Jackaman's achievements in restructuring Hiram
Walker-Allied Vintners, and Mr Hales's refocusing of the group's food
operations. Analysts also welcomed the appointments of Mr David Jarvis, 44,
former Allied Distillers boss and since last year responsible for Far East
and special markets, who will head the food division; and Mr John Giffen,
52, managing director of Hiram Walker-Allied Vintners, who will assume full
responsibility for the wines and spirits division.
Sir Derrick, in a letter to shareholders yesterday, said an investigation
into the losses by KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock, the company's auditor, had
revealed that Allied's treasury had been 'dealing in foreign currency
instruments which were inappropriate, and in which it lacked the requisite
trading skills'.
The scale of the trading, which led to an exposure of Pounds 1.5bn before
NatWest was called in to close positions in March, had been excessive.
Sir Derrick, who was first alerted by the Bank of England to unusual dealing
activity last summer, said an internal investigation then had found no need
for further action. After further warnings, it was discovered that the
group's exposure limit of Pounds 500m had been breached.
Changes in treasury staff and efforts to bring foreign currency exposures
'to more prudent levels' were made. Accrued losses diminished significantly
in February but the position deteriorated again as efforts were made to
trade out of the losses.
Sir Derrick said there was no evidence of dishonest or corrupt practices. It
was 'an isolated occurrence . . . though I do not seek to minimise the
seriousness of the losses incurred'. Foreign exchange trading had now been
restricted to 'the more conventional type of treasury activity'.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: A night at the Mango
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JACK HILLBROOKE, the legendary chairman of Hillbrooke's the bookmakers, was
so pleased with himself this week that he invited me to dinner at the Moody
Mango in Mayfair, a private dining club that is so decadently exclusive (the
waiters are from Padua: nothing else will do) and so amusingly expensive
(Pounds 950 for four) that I doubt you have even heard of it.
Not that that worries us - just as it failed to discombobulate our companion
on Thursday: Lady Catherine de Moubray-ffrench-Moubray, a vivacious redhead,
small-time racehorse owner and mutual friend.
At Jack's table no expense is spared, so we were soon up to our elbows in
caviar and songthrush pate, devilled squids' eyes and ingeniously stuffed
voles, plates of malevolent fugu, honest abbacchio al forno (roast sucking
lamb) - and rose diaboliche, velvety red roses dipped in batter and fried in
olive oil: the sort they give brides to eat at midnight, in January, in some
parts of Italy.
Jack is the 14th richest man in Britain, comptroller of a dazzling empire
that, anchored on its UK betting shops, now spans the globe: timber, gold
mines, shipping, airlines, property, hotels - all of it funded by the Pounds
200m he has sucked out of British racing in the past 25 years.
(Recently, there has been speculation in down-market publications as to
whether the legendary Jack Hillbrooke truly exists. But what is 'existence'?
Without getting drawn into airy-fairy debate of a sub-atomic nature, I can
state two things: 1) Whatever the meaning of existence, Jack is as real to
me as most of my other friends, including Lady Catherine; 2) He never talks
to other journalists, cannot and will not abide them, calls them pygmies. I
am the only reporter he sees. It is this last factor, I fear, that has
spawned envy and allegations - but there we have it).
'You seem cheerful, Jack,' I said, as we helped ourselves to puffer fish.
Jack had just returned from Moscow. Despite his workload he finds time to
serve as special adviser to president Gorbachev.
'You'd be cheerful if you'd arrived back from where I've just arrived back
from,' said silver-haired Jack. 'Britain may be recessed but the Tories are
running a miracle economy compared with that lot in Russia.
'On Tuesday I was in the Kremlin. Committee room XX. All gold and scarlet
with aggressively modernist pictures of the jolliest tractor plant somewhere
near Yakutsk. For their latest brainwave they have asked me to establish a
chain of 15,000 betting shops across the Soviet Union.
'I said: 'And what will you bet on? The latest price of vodka?' And they
said: 'UK racing.' I said: 'Do you mean to say that the proletariat is going
to spend half a day in the bread queue and then half a day in another queue
waiting to discover whether Lady Beaverbrook has won the big race at
Newmarket?' And they said: 'How good's Lady Beaverbrook? When is she running
next?' They thought I was hawking tips.'
Jack spread his hands, dabbed at his mouth and glanced at the corner table.
Although no-one in the Moody Mango realised it, the two saturnine
middleweights sitting in the corner happened to be Jack's minders - KGB
joy-boys in Marks &amp; Spencer suits and with identically-numbered passports
loaned to him by his good friend Gorbachev.
'Nevertheless, Jack,' said Lady Catherine de Moubray-ffrench-Moubray
snakily, 'I bet you are teaching the Russians some tricks. Like how to
fleece the betting population of its hard-earned cash and to hoodwink the
government into letting you bookies squeeze untold millions out of horse
racing while poor owners like me, who keep the sport going, year in, year
out, at debilitating cost, are left to fend while our horses run for peanuts
and our training bills soar and the sport goes to pot. One day quite soon,
Jack, no-one will want to own racehorses and there will be nothing left to
bet on and four hundred years of tradition will have disappeared in smoke.'
'Catherine,' said Jack fondly, 'the trouble with you owners is that you are
far too greedy. If memory serves, you have a house in Belgravia, a place in
the Cotswolds, a time-share in Guatemala, several important paintings, more
money than Michael, a Bentley better than my own and a supply of young
Korean chauffeurs whom you hire on six-month contracts.
'You are not, so to speak, a member of the under-class. To owners like you
the poverty trap is the gap between the salmon counter and the caviar stall
at Harrods.'
As time was getting on, I asked Jack whether GREENGOD-VI, his fabled
computer program, had any tips for today's 2,000 Guineas. As I revealed last
December, it was this computer's predecessor, GREENGOD-V, that caused
Margaret Thatcher's downfall by manipulating the election betting.
'Funny you should ask,' said Jack, 'but until I mentioned your name,
Michael, GREENGOD-VI hadn't spoken to us for 57 hours. It is working on
something secret, something amazingly momentous. But when I told it I was
meeting you for dinner it came to life at once and flashed all its lights.
It always reads your column.
''Tell Michael,' said GREENGOD-VI, 'to back Mystiko as though his life
depended on it - at least eight VBBU's (Very Big Betting Units) each way.'
Then it fell quiet again, turned off all its lights.'
Shortly afterwards, Jack paid the bill and silently departed. Which left me
with Lady Catherine. Clutching my wrist, she steered me towards the corner
table where the lads from the KGB were finishing their coffee.
'Good evening, boys,' said Catherine, in perfectly-phrased Russian. 'Michael
and I understand that you know very little about horse racing. It is a
bewitching story that started in a leafy place called Newmarket a long, long
time ago . . .'
Their eyes grew big as saucers.

FT  04 MAY 91 / A way of telling tales out of court: A moneymaking
proposition for spreading enlightment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM TOLD that people read the front half of the Weekend FT to discover
information which could enable them to increase their income, and this end
of the paper merely to be entertained. So I hope I'm not speaking out of
place if I suggest in this column a business proposition which I have long
been convinced would enrich anyone who acted on it.
My suggestion is the mass marketing of reports from the Law Courts in
tabloid form. But, unlike the tabloids themselves, there would be no
comment, bowdlerisation or sensationalisation - subscribers would have the
great satisfaction of knowing that they were actually reading the truth
about acts of corruption, horror and rascality, rather than a figment or
fragment.
It is true that the 'heavy' papers publish unvarnished law reports, but
these are highly selective, often woefully abridged, and, besides, are
buried in an inky morass of other news which no one is really interested in:
such as whether the Kurds' haven is safe enough for John Major to be able to
sleep at night, or the state of Paul Gascoigne's physiognomy, or whether
there will be growth in the spring, or when political journalists think
political pundits think MPs think the prime minister thinks he might hold
the next general election.
This is something which is approximately five stages from reality, and on
which people are apparently prepared to spend good money to read. How much
more potent and commercial is the cold truth of the courtroom.
On Thursday alone, for example, there was a spate of abridged reports of
different cases spread across the newspapers, which, consolidated into one
tabloid, would provide at least an hour's gripping reading and provoke
thought that would last the rest of the day.
I have space for only two here. First, in Thursday's Daily Telegraph there
is Ravenscroft v Rederiaktiebologet Transatlantic, in which the mother of an
employee crushed by a runaway forklift truck was awarded Pounds 16,500
damages for 'remote shock,' although she did not see the accident, was not
present at her son's death in hospital, and did not see his body immediately
afterwards. But two psychiatrists agreed that she was suffering 'a prolonged
grief reaction as defined by the International Classification of Disease
Code 309.1 (HMSO 9241540044 and 9241540052). All very interesting in the
light of yesterday's decision by the courts in Liverpool not to award
similar damages to the parents of those crushed to death in the Sheffield
football ground tragedy, even those parents who witnessed the horror live on
television.
Second, this from Thursday's Independent, detailing the case of C in the
Chancery Division (Court of Protection): the court, in the form of that most
amiable and sensible of judges, Lennie Hoffmann, decided to make a will and
dispose immediately of large chunks of C's considerable fortune, to hospital
authorities and relatives, because C, now 75, was born with such mental
retardation that, the court decided, she had 'lacked testamentary capacity
since birth.' The report stated that 'immediate gifts of Pounds 100,000 to
the friends of the hospital and Pounds 400,000 to family were ordered.'
Very nice, too. I couldn't help wondering, though, whether C's family had
any role in the development of the case. And I noticed that the wealthy Miss
C has been a long-term patient in a National Health Service hospital. And
since Miss C's pre-mortem bequests were made by order of the court on the
basis of what she would have wanted, had her mind been normal, whether it
might not also have considered that C would have wanted instead to spend her
own money on her own comfort in a luxurious private hospital. Miss C was
described as 'enjoying music, the sound of birds, the smell of flowers.' Mr
Justice Hoffmann should at least have ensured that a world-renowned string
quartet be paid top dollar to come and play at her bedside every Saturday
night.
Now, imagine cases like these distributed through your letter-box daily,
with no editorial and no advertisements. It is the business opportunity of a
lifetime; but to anyone who exploits the idea from this copyrighted column,
and fails to pay me commission, I have a message: see you in court, and read
all about it.

FT  04 MAY 91 / A good sport, bad at games: Kenneth Clarke hated playing
cricket at school but admits to Teresa Mclean a selective love of the game
today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESEA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I GOT UP grotesquely early in order to talk about cricket with Kenneth
Clarke, secretary of state for education and science. The Department of
Education and Science is a dreary office block next to Waterloo Station,
London, and its employees arrived for work in bits and drabs, looking
dismal. The only person with a smile on his face was a very tall, very thin
West Indian official who grinned while touching his toes. Between manoeuvres
he checked identification cards.
I was relieved to be taken to the 12th floor, half asleep, for another long
wait before Clarke arrived late and greeted me through clouds of cigar
smoke. It was a cigar interview. Clarke launched it, practising his smoke
puffs: 'This isn't going to be about politics, is it?'
'No. Don't worry. Only about cricket.'
A wave of the arm. 'Sit down. Doesn't matter where.'
He was already sitting down. In shirtsleeves, warm, comfortable, well-padded
by good dinners, untroubled by anything this world might produce to threaten
him.
'I was useless at cricket. Never played it; only if I had to at school.
Never wanted to play it.'
Clarke's secretary sat at the other end of a long table, taking occasional
notes that didn't seem to have anything to do with what he was saying. She
gave the impression of filling in time, as did Clarke, who never pretended
to know much about the game, just enough to find it 'absorbing and
relaxing'.
But it didn't take long for his cricketing incompetence to inspire him to
some rhetoric.
'Come to think of it, I did play for the Department of Employment against
our opposite numbers in the Labour party. That was great fun. It was in a
village in the Cotswolds and I played for two years running. The first year
was tremendous. I even took some wickets, bowling to some very, very bad
batsmen.'
'What sort of bowling did you do?' He was delighted with that question,
beamed and caressed his stomach.
'No idea. I just hurled it down.' He went on, enveloped in a swirling smog
of mauvish smoke. 'I took a slip catch. The ball was coming straight at me
and I couldn't get out of the way fast enough. That game gave me a false
idea of my ability. The next year was awful. I hit the ball, somehow, in the
direction of square leg, set off down the pitch and collapsed in agony with
a torn calf muscle.'
I showed concern. 'There's worse to come. The umpire pursued me all the way
off the field of play to make sure the scorer, who was my wife, knew that I
had scored 0, not 1.' He ended the story on a note of splendid pathos.
'Retired hurt for 0. I hung up my bat.'
Since then Clarke has stuck to what he really likes doing, which is
watching, not playing cricket. 'I like it because I am a traditionalist. I
find cricket aesthetically pleasing.'
'Do you like village cricket?'
'Not much. I don't watch it.'
'One-day cricket?'
'No. I hate it. I like Test and county cricket. I don't find county cricket
boring; I find it intriguing, though I seldom have time to go to matches.
What I really like is Test cricket.'
His favourite Test ground is Trent Bridge - his home ground - where he was
taken to county matches as a boy and learnt to love the game. He was born
and brought up in Nottingham and is MP for Mansfield, in Nottingham.
Clarke's local patriotism is one of the most likeable things about him and
one of the few things he talked about with genuine concern. When I asked him
who was his favourite cricketer, he chose Reg Simpson, the great
Nottinghamshire and England batsman and fielder of the late 1940s and early
1950s.
Simpson was a most distinguished hardy perennial of English cricket but he
was not one of the glamorous choices I would have expected of Clarke, who
described his hero simply: 'He was a marvellous cricketer.'
Almost embarrassed to be caught in anything other than his jolly-good-chap
mode, Clarke added: 'Reg is on the Nottinghamshire committee now, you know,
and I see him whenever I go to Trent Bridge.'
He goes as often as he can, which is not as often as he would like, and he
was outspoken in his preference for Trent Bridge to Lords, which he finds an
unfriendly place. Given that he prefers football to cricket because football
is a 'total switch-off', whereas cricket demands attention, he said he can
think of few nicer ways of spending a day than watching local lad Eddie
Hemmings play in a Trent Bridge Test match.
His cigar finished, his smile getting a bit tired, Clarke admitted that
sometimes Lords had more to offer than Trent Bridge. There followed an
almost caricature-like depiction of himself living the good life.
'I have a friend who is an Indian businessman. He has a box at Lords, in the
best possible position, and it is always full of people for Test matches. I
go along there and enjoy myself immensely.' It was with this friend that
Clarke took part in a bizarre and exotic little escapade of cricket oddity.
His secretary and I listened in silent fascination as he told us how he had
gone out to stay with his friend in Bombay a while ago and they had suddenly
decided, after dinner, to go and look at the Test ground.
'We went to the ground, got in without too much trouble and walked out to
the middle. We walked round and round and up and down the pitch. It was
midnight and there was a huge, bright moon in the sky. Then some officials
came and made us go.
'Next time the politics of education and science strikes you as a trifle on
the dull side, conjure up in your mind the image of the present minister
walking in the footsteps of the greats of Indian cricket, illicitly, in
tropical clothes, on a moonlit night.'
Clarke found the image irresistible and mused on it contentedly while I
tried to get a few matter-of-fact statements from him about cricket in
English schools and the future of English cricket.
He forestalled me by admitting all cricket's problems and weaknesses in this
country. There was less school cricket than there had ever been before so
there was a smaller pool of players for first-class teams to draw on. He did
not have the faintest idea what to do about any of these troubles. The
nearest he got to a defensive reaction or a statement of policy was his
pronouncement, with an air of after-dinner humour, that the obvious answer
to the decline of cricket in schools was to make it compulsory in all
schools, for both sexes.
My parting question was the first one which caught him off guard,
floundering around for something to say. I asked him how he would describe
himself in politics, using cricketing comparisons. Did he see himself as a
hard hitting Gooch-like batsman? A graceful, Gower-like batsman, perhaps? A
cunning slow bowler? Or what?
He replied: 'What a strange question] I can't see myself as any type of
player. I don't fall into any category. All I can say for certain is that
I'm not a slow bowler, but anyone can see that for themselves, can't they?'

FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: Last of 'Russian Spring'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE SOUTH Bank's celebration of Russian culture came to its end of Thursday,
when Kent Nagano conducted the London Philharmonic in a neglected
masterpiece by the greatest of all Russian composers. After all the
stylistic excursions of these concerts it was salutary to be returned to the
chaste neoclassical beauty of Stravinsky's Persephone, the 1934 'melodrama
in three acts' to a text by Andre Gide, especially in such a beautifully
prepared account as this, with the tenor Anthony Rolfe Johnson and narrator
Anne Fournet.
Yet the last week of the series had been dominated by a much less familiar
name. Nikolay Roslavets, born in 1881, was the leading avant-garde figure in
Soviet music in the 1920s; he had trained at the Moscow Conservatory,
followed much the same stylistic course through Rimsky-Korskaov and French
impressionism as the slightly younger Stravinsky. During the First World
War, however, Roslavets's style suddenly became much more radical; he
developed a system of harmonic organisation, and is credited with inventing
his own version of 12-note composition quite independently of Schoenberg,
whose music he seems not to have heard until 1923.
After the 1917 revolution he gladly put his music at the service of the new
state, believing, like so many poets and visual artists, that a new social
order automatically implied a revolutionary approach to the arts. He was
briefly head of a conservatory and edited a music journal, but inevitably in
the 1920s he began to fall foul of the Stalinist machine; his music was
condemned for its 'bourgeois ideology', and though Roslavets defended
himself in polemical style, his music was totally proscribed after 1930, and
his name expunged from all Soviet reference books.
He died in Moscow in 1944 and his music has remained just a footnote in the
histories of 20th-century music. But the centenary of his birth a decade ago
renewed interest in his achievement, and under glasnost his rehabilitation
has gathered momentum. The 'Russian Spring' series uncovered four pieces:
last week Ashkenazy and the Philharmonia brought the Violin Concerto of
1925, with Tatyana Grindenko as soloist; on Wednesday the Arditti Quartet's
Soviet programme included the British premieres of Roslavets's Music for
string quartet and his Third String Quartet, while Nagano began his concert
on Thursday with the first performance in Britain of the unfinished tone
poem from 1910, Aux Heures de la nouvelle lune.
Such stories deserves to have happy endings, and it would be wonderful to
greet Roslavets as a distinctive and significant voice, set to alter our
view of Russian music in the 20th century. But while Roslavets's historical
significance is undeniable his intrinsic musical worth, on the basis of the
works heard in London, seems uncertain. The confident French accents of the
tone poem, full of glittering orchestration a la Dukas and Ravel, show the
young composer as a prodigious talent who might well have flourished had he
followed Stravinsky and Prokofiev into exile during the Revolution. But the
technique that Roslavets thrashed out for himself during the years when
Russia tore itself apart and writing music must seemed the most irrevelent
of occupations, is so contrived that the instinctive early flair appears to
have been suffocated. The string quartets are busy with notes yet short on
rigour and ideas, while the Violin Concerto, composed in an elaborate
12-note technique at the height of his influence, still reeks of Skryabin
and uses repetitive, sequential gestures to over-stretch its thin material
and tie itself in structural knots.
Yet the re-emergence of a genuine radical voice from the early, untarnished
years of the Soviet Union must have strengthened the resolve of the
present-day musical radicals. As recently as 1980, it's worth remembering,
Edison Denisov and Sofia Gubaydulina were condemned by the chairman of the
Soviet Composers' Union. Now, though, visiting Russian orchestras bring
Gubaydulina's on tour: on Tuesday the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra
included her violin concerto, Offertorium, in the second of its South Bank
concerts.
Offertorium is the most sustained and impressive of Gubaydulina's works I've
heard so far, a fascinating 40-minute contemplation of Bach and Webern that
moves in ever wider sweeps until it flows into a final string chant. The
solo part was written for Gidon Kremer, who brings to it on disc a flair and
intensity that Vladislav Igolinsky just missed in this London premiere. If
the future of Russian music is Gubaydulina and Shnitke, as 'Russian Spring'
has demonstrated so convincingly, its past remains Prokofiev, Stravinsky and
Shostakovich, not Roslavets, however wishfully we might want to rewrite
history.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: Favart the forgotten - Opera-comique rediscoveries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IN COMMON parlance the Theatre de l'Opera-Comique is known as the Salle
Favart. The street running adjacent its one side is the Rue Favart. There is
a Hotel Favart across the way from the front entrance. But otherwise Charles
Simon Favart (1710-92), librettist and playwright, is a forgotten figure;
the founding role he played in the development of the French popular
operatic style will be unknown to all except the most assiduous of opera
students.
The programme of two small-scale operas on Favart librettos - 'Hommage a
Favart' - that has been mounted at the Opera-Comique was no doubt devised
with some such enlightening purpose in mind. Happily, it proves not at all
dusty exercise in music-historical revival but one of the most delightful -
and surprising - evenings of light entertainment I've spent in ages. This
beloved small theatre, scene of many landmark events in French opera, has
recently re-established a firm identity as the proper Paris stage for operas
small, unpretentious, or off the beaten track. The double bill of La Fee
Urgele (text by Favart, music by Duni) and La Repetition interrompue (text
by Favart, songs from popular stock) made an unbeatable case for its
continued existence: would that London possessed, and supported, a Salle
Favart of its own]
Favart's father, a pastrycook, was a devotee of those popular musical works,
descended from the fairground entertainments of the 16th century, in which
speech and song were the modes of delivery. His son was soon pouring out
texts for various outlets; he was to enjoy a long and picaresque career
whose unifying factor was a flair for the genre that was multifarious and
forward-looking.
It was Favart's driving force, his ability to learn good tricks from the
rival Italian troupes who crossed his Paris paths, and his skill in finding
new and enjoyable modes of expression for the perennial themes and
characters of popular opera, that directly encouraged the development of
opera-comique. From the 1750s onward, the use of traditional melodies gave
way to that of newly composed airs, and then to the commissioning of
properly-worked scores; Favart's close collaboration, in the later stages of
his career, with such composers as Monsigny, Philidor and the Vienna-based
Gluck indicates in itself the fascinating way opera-comique came in from the
streets and the fairgrounds without losing its popular character.
The Italian Egidio Duni (1708-75) was another of Favart's regular Paris
collaborators; La Fee Urgele (1765) was one of their biggest successes.
Favart based the libretto on a Voltaire tale: the testing in love of the
knight Robert for Marton, who turns out to be the fairy Urgele, 'protectrice
fidele des chevaliers'. Romantic-pastoral elements (a court of love presided
over by Queen Berthe and her all-female judges) mingle with supernatural,
comic episodes (Robert's unwilling amorous entanglement with an Old Woman,
Marton's servant in disguise) with Rousseau-esque sentiment.
In this first-rate performance, produced by Jean-Marie Villegier in the
enchanting chinoiserie set of Carlo Tommasi, choreographed by Nathalie Van
Parys, and with the orchestra of Les Arts Florissants conducted by
Christophe Rousset, the surprise was the saltiness of the humour, the
crispness of the unfolding, and the wonderfully natural movement between
speech and song. Duni's charming overture, dance movements and succession of
Italianate airs touch no great depths, undergo no Philidor-like adventures
with form; but his melodic fluency and bold sense of colour are gifts by no
means to be scorned, nor is the gentle lyricism which informs the later
passages of Robert's 'trials'.
If there was a fault in Villegier's production, it was perhaps a tendency to
overweight with undue emphasis the sentimental aspects of the work: since
there had already been a lengthy prologue to La Fee d'Urgele' in the form of
the highly amusing Repetition interrompue, and since Act 4 was taken at a
distinctly moderate pace, the sum total was a rather long sit.
But the expertise of the participants was almost always compensation. On
this evidence, the number of young French singers who can use their voices
with sweetness and elegance, who can speak, move and dance with easy
elegance and command of 18th-century deportment is now enviably large: the
sopranos Miriam Ruggeri (a deliciously funny Old Woman) and Monique Zanetti,
the tenor Pierre Catala (handsome, witty, and exceptionally musical) and the
baritone Jean-Francois Gardeil were only the most prominent of an expert
cast, which also included our own Jennifer Smith, that most multilingual of
British singers, in sparkling form.
This was one of those evenings when a whole neglected area of opera seemed
to spring to new life: I hope there will be many more such opera-comique
rediscoveries from Villegier and his Arts Florissants colleagues.
