FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: 'Cyrano' without a heart / David Bintley's new ballet
for the Royal Ballet is historical flummery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER ELSE David Bintley's new Cyrano may not be, it is consistent.
Consistent in its determination to tickle a rib and jerk a tear, in its
eager pursuit of the lowest common denominator in score, design and dance.
It offers spectacle akin to Hollywood costume drama, with the quaintness and
pish-tushery, the plumed hats and swordsmanship, dear to fans of the Three
Musketeers. It has jokes, crowd scenes, thin choreography, and a constant
buzz of small dramatic roles being played to the hilt. Its relationship with
ballet as a serious art is tenuous.
The first performance of Cyrano took place on Thursday night. It is in three
acts and follows the narrative of Rostand's play; it deploys a large cast,
and defies comprehension as anything other than a display of historical
costume. It is best, first, to forget Rostand. His Cyrano is about the
intoxication of words, the torrential images, the verbal conceits and
caprices, with which his hero greets life and love, and provides a carapace
for his deepest feelings. To convert this into movement presupposes a
treatment less tightly wedded to Rostand's narrative than Bintley has
chosen. His Cyrano the versifier and Cyrano the swordsman must mime speech
or battle dutifully, while encased in the trappings of period dress and
predictable steps. And without the magic of language, we are left with a
melodrama whose picaresque elements may be intriguing to produce, but do not
encourage Bintley in the creation of dance incident of any extended
interest.
What we see is historical flummery. Hayden Griffin has designed scenery and
costumes that are accurate, careful, and claustrophobic - for part of the
evening the stage looks too small for the action and the seething hordes in
boots and hats and swirling cloaks.
What we hear in Wilfred Joseph's score is eclectic writing that is like a
patchwork of influences from pastiche Prokofiev to feeblest Erich Korngold.
It is music as sound-track, and though it may be obedient to Bintley's
dramatic scheme, it encourages no expansiveness of drama or feeling: the
central moments of the narrative - the balcony scene; Cyrano's last meeting
with Roxane - are cheated. But Cyrano de Bergerac as a drama has been
cheated throughout. Bintley has opted for spectacle, for flashy effects - a
brawl in the theatre; the siege of Arras - and has found no way to touch the
heart of the play, which is Cyrano's heart.
Amid the industrious to-ing and fro-ing of the cast - and all Rostand's
characters are there, busily making their mark - the central tragedy of
Cyrano, Roxane and Christian is diminished since, as I have suggested, the
play's concern with words is not to be translated into dance. The
justification for the enterprise is, nevertheless, Stephen Jefferies'
incarnation of Cyrano.
From his earliest appearances, nearly 20 years ago, Jefferies showed himself
one of those rare beings who are entirely at home on stage, able to convey,
with superlative precision and clarity, the most fleeting emotions. In his
greatest roles - I think especially of his Rudolf in Mayerling - his
performances were touched with genius. As Cyrano, he is a marvel. The part
may be limited, but Jefferies' playing knows no horizons, no constraints.
Passion, humour, sensibility, lightning shifts between sorrow and manic
energy, are part of a reading as complete and compelling as any I have seen
in the play. He even convinces us that Cyrano is a poet - which the ballet
no-where does. In the speech when Cyrano pretends to have fallen from the
moon (embellished with exquisite vulgarity by musical quotes from the
Moonlight sonata, and other lunar tunes) Jefferies is a consummate droll. In
those tightrope moments when Cyrano nearly - ah, so nearly - declares
himself to Roxane, Jefferies is sublime in sensitivity and controlled
feeling. It is a glorious performance.
Among the other principals, Lesley Collier is an intelligent if rather
mature Roxane; Bruce Sansom an agreeable Christian, though the role looks
papery. The rest of the cast play and dance for all they are worth - and
they are worth a ballet better than this.

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
TODAY IS the centenary of one of the most momentous struggles of modern
European history. The date you may have forgotten: the battle, surely not.
May 4 1891 was, of course, the day when Professor Moriarty, the 'Napoleon of
crime', grappled above the Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland with the world's
wisest detective, Sherlock Holmes.
To mark the centenary, a party of 100 Sherlockologists has been journeying
towards Meiringen and the Reichenbach Falls. The pilgrims are clad entirely
in late-Victorian and Edwardian costume: en route to the Falls, they will
have stopped at various Swiss stations, and been greeted by local mayors and
brass bands.
Negotiating Alpine paths in spats and knickerbockers must be more than
compensated by celebrity in those immaculate Swiss railway stations; and it
is right to call these people pilgrims, for they are bound for the site of a
miracle. Holmes was declared dead; he returned to life, and as far as anyone
knows, is agelessly pursuing apiculture somewhere on the Sussex Downs.
It has been put about by one of the many learned members of the Sherlock
Holmes Society that the death and three-year disappearance of the detective
was really a severe nervous breakdown, brought on by the strain of tackling
Moriarty and his henchmen.
This hypothesis is typical of the Sherlockologists: like Holmes himself,
they like to produce the occasional monograph. The Swiss excursion is the
most ambitious of their activities; otherwise, they meet up for an annual
dinner on January 6, to honour the sleuth's birthday, and stage jaunts to
inspect the locations of his cases.
Conan Doyle always left a few clues: a house embroidered with wisteria here,
a suspicious thicket there - enough to get the Sherlockologists rifling
through back numbers of The Times, and checking Met Office records, to
quibble over exact dates and places.
The Sherlock Holmes Society has a membership 1,000 strong. Its secretary
would rather his name were not given here: he can hardly cope with the
volume of correspondence he receives as it is. This doesn't surprise me. The
Holmes stories are, as George Orwell memorably categorised them, Good Bad
Books; I don't think there are any Better Bad Books, in fact. The formulaic
writing nauseated even Conan Doyle himself, but in many respects it has worn
more hardily than the style of Conan Doyle's disciple, PG Wodehouse.
We still like to read with frissons of horror about crimes in Upper Norwood
and althoughBaker Street is now infested with tarts in our imaginations it
still contains a drug addict with the sharpest of wits, a scholar who can go
five rounds of fisticuffs with the biggest bar bully - a hawkish physiognomy
over a violin or Bunsen burner. He is so much more rounded than modern
demi-gods: it is no wonder we will not let him die.
But a sort of immortality is secured for Sherlock Holmes on a firmer basis
than pure literary charisma. As the Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg has
demonstrated, the detective techniques of Sherlock Holmes epitomise modern
faith in scientific inquiry. The powers of deduction with which Holmes so
frequently amazes Watson, and the stolid coppers of Scotland Yard, amount to
a method of determining truth through minutiae: discarded cigar butts,
scuffs on a boot heel, a singular ear lobe.
As a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles, of things that the less observant
overlook, Holmes aligns himself to Giovanni Morelli, who in the last century
established the science of connoisseurship and attribution in art, by
identifying unsigned Botticelli paintings according to the tiny anatomical
similarities shared with figures in pictures actually signed by Botticelli;
and Holmes joins Sigmund Freud, who revealed the subconscious as the fount
of personality.
Detective, art connoisseur, psychologist: each requires the same expertise
of decipherment, each assumes that there are clues to knowledge which need
interpretation. How many Sherlockologists are doctors I don't know: but
MoreIIi, Freud and Arthur Conan Doyle all had medical backgrounds, and I
imagine that Sherlock Holmes will remain popular for as long as we respect
his model of clinical detachment.

<TEXT>
or a day's fly fishing on the Kennet - will go to whoever can present
credible evidence of having caught, by fair angling means, a specimen of
Salvethymus Svetovidovi, otherwise known as Svetovidov's long-finned char.
This is undoubtedly the most challenging angling contest ever devised, and I
am pretty confident the prize will go unclaimed. For there are certain
obstacles to the pursuit of this creature, which - in fairness to the more
adventurous readers of this column - I should outline.
For one thing, the fish is unique to one lake in the entire world. It is
called El'gygytgyn, and it is situated in Central Chutotoka.
Quite where Chutotoka is, I am not sure. Somewhere in eastern Siberia,
perhaps.
Wherever it is, Lake El'gygytgyn is not likely to figure on the tourist
agenda. According to my information - gathered from a translation of a
learned Russian treatise - it is frozen solid for all but two months of the
year. The climate is described as extremely harsh and the fauna as extremely
sparse ; scienceSpeak for a God-forsaken, wind-whipped, snow-bound,
ice-encrusted hellhole of a place.
Assume, however, that the intrepid angler actually manages to find
El'gygytgyn during its ice-free summer. The problems are only just
beginning.
The long-finned char prefers to swim at a depth of 150 feet or more. In
addition it is a demersal planktivore , which means - I think - that it is
most unlikely to snap at a spinner or bait even if means could be devised to
get them down to it. At this point I will leave it to the expert.
I have not been to Lake El'gygytgyn, nor would anything induce me to do so.
But I can claim to be one of the few fishermen in England - possibly the
only one - to have seen Svetovidov's long-finned char in the flesh. I can
exclusively report that they are very small, very dark, with a very few tiny
spots, and long fins.
The only interesting thing about them is that they are the first new
specimen of salmonid to be identified in recent times. For this Anatoly
Nikolayevich Svetovidov, who first trawled one from El'gygytgyn's frigid
depths, will be honoured by ichthyologists, if not by anglers.
I saw, and indeed touched, this rare creature in the basement of the Natural
History Museum, whence it had just arrived in a bottle of preserving alcohol
from the Soviet Union. I had gone there at the kind invitation of the senior
scientific officer, Gordon Howes, to learn something of the habits of the
giant European catfish; and to delve into the legends associated with this
mysterious and disgusting freshwater monster.
It is difficult, however, not to be sidetracked when one is surrounded by
the world's greatest collection of preserved fish, some of which date back
300 years and more. It was not long before I was peering over Howes'
shoulder into the dusty cabinets on whose shelves the fishes of the world
gleam in their multitudes, heads down or standing on their tails in their
jars of fluid.
I asked him about the Goliath Tigerfish. I had caught the ordinary tigerfish
on the Zambesi and in Lake Kariba, and had heard tales of a gigantic cousin,
of unparalleled fierceness, to be found somewhere in the darkest jungle or
densest bush of Central Africa. Had Mr Howes heard of it?
He smiled gently, and produced a jar the size of a coalscuttle in which a
mighty fish was suspended, jaws agape, vicious teeth glinting. It was enough
to fire visions of tangling with the beast in some unexplored tributary of
the Upper Congo.
Among other river predators, Howes showed me an Amazonian fish which made
the piranha look no more threatening than Charlie Bubbles, our lethargic
goldfish. He scooped it from its bottle to display its oral weaponry. From
its lower jaw rose two fangs so long that Nature had provided holes through
the top of its snout to contain them. This was Hydrolocus, the wolf-fish, a
creature of nightmares.
We went to Howes' office. I glimpsed a dissected cod under a microscope. On
another table was a minute butterfly fish from Indonesia, collected by Mungo
Park. Before giving me a friendly, fishy handshake, Howes presented me with
a scientific paper arguing that rainbow trout had been wrongly classified. I
reeled out into the spring sunshine, exhilarated by the unusual experience
of acquiring learning.
A few weeks ago the BBC showed a sobering film - in which Howes appeared -
on the devastating impact of spending restrictions on the Natural History
Museum's research programme. I cannot argue that the possession of 750,000
dead fish in bottles is of much practical use to anyone. But the collection
does represent knowledge, and it reflects to the nation's credit. It, and
those who tend it, deserve honour and protection.

A SPLENDID party took place this week in the garden of St James's Square, in
London. Some hundreds of authors, publishers, reviewers, and  - most
importantly - readers gathered, with their guests and staff, to celebrate
the literary world's best-loved institution. The Queen Mother was also
there. For this month marks the 150th anniversary of the founding of the
London Library.
Other events will follow. The Antiquarian Booksellers Association is
arranging a small exhibition at a book fair at the Park Lane Hotel, London,
from June 25 to 27.
In October the library has arranged a series of seven lectures in which
distinguished members will talk about predecessors - Noel Annan on Carlyle,
Lord Quinton on Milnes, AS Byatt on George Eliot and GH Lewes, John Julius
Norwich on Kipling, Kenneth Rose on Harold Nicholson, AN Wilson on Rose
Macaulay, and John Wells on Some Former Librarians.
A commemorative medallion has been struck, available from the librarian at
Pounds 49.50 in bronze and Pounds 98.50 in silver. Later in the year
Macmillan will publish a history of the library by John Wells. Entitled Rude
Words, and described as discursive, it is unlikely to be the usual dull
corporate panegyric.
The library owes its existence to the indignation of that bad-tempered
genius, Thomas Carlyle. The lack of books had made his childhood in Scotland
seem like prison, but when he reached London, he found things little better.
The greatest city in the world had no public libraries and books were
expensive. True there was the British Museum, but Carlyle chafed at the rule
which confined the books to the premises.
Carlyle shamed writers to raise money, donate books, help design a sensible
catalogue and recruit members. The library's first auditor was William
Thackeray.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Gardening: Seed-time mysteries laid bare - Now is the the
time to lay the foundations for a cheap summer in the garden - with or
without expert help PR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE next fortnight, you can lay the foundation for a cheap summer in the
garden. The weather has turned in your favour and has remembered how to
rain; the effort is minimal and the skill is not much greater. You need some
seed-packets, a rake, and a will to experiment. If you need somebody to talk
you through it, we have a new dialogue of experts to help us.
The dialogue is conducted by Christopher Lloyd and Graham Rice, and is
published as Garden Flowers from Seed (Pounds 17.99, Viking). They do not
hold a dialogue as Socrates seems to have understood one, a sort of bullying
match in which the senior expert, Christopher Lloyd, is allowed to tie a
younger questioner into knots.
Instead, both partners exchange views without too many disagreements, but in
a chatty tone which may not suit all readers. The result is a double-edged
insight into some of gardening's great mysteries. Over them all hangs the
really big puzzle: why will some seeds grow so easily, while others sit and
sulk? There are lesser mysteries on the way through: why do petunia
seedlings sometimes fizzle out? Why should you never sow mallows in the same
place, year after year? Why do some verbenas germinate, and others come to
nothing? What are the ground rules for Bizzy Lizzie if you do not wish to
buy it in June at more than Pounds 1 a plant?
Fortunately, both partners in the dialogue seem to agree with my favourites.
They merely disagree about one of the methods. This weekend, I will be
sowing seeds directly into open ground, the simplest of all procedures.
Loosen up a bare patch of earth; rake it over; press it with the back of the
rake to make a series of straight seed-drills about half an inch deep.
Arrange these straight drills at various angles so that you do not end up
with nothing but a straight, long line. Sow the seeds directly and press the
soil back over them with gentle pressure from the rake's head, holding the
rake itself upright. Follow Rice and disagree with Lloyd, who prefers to
broadcast the seed irregularly. I find this habit extravagant and harder to
control as its results progress.
Most varieties no longer need a greenhouse in May and certainly do not need
daily attention. You can sow them on a Saturday afternoon, water them again
on a Sunday evening, if the weather is hot, and forget the entire escapade
until the next weekend but one or two. By then, seedlings ought to be
showing.
My first instinct is to make a beeline for the blues: Love in a Mist (the
Miss Jekyll variety) and dark blue Phacelia. The experts agree on my
experience, that both of these transplant badly, like poppies or mignonette.
You need to leave a few plants in each seed-drill without disturbance,
having thinned out their unwanted neighbours a week or so after germination.
I am also fond of the easy Echium Blue Bedder, although Lloyd complains that
it only lasts for two or three weeks. I find that it will pull itself
together for a second season if you cut it very hard after the first
flowering.
Among tall varieties, we all agree on Malope, the big mallow, but it is not
often stocked in shops' seed-racks. I also like rose-lilac Agrostemma, which
Lloyd shrewdly suggests as a good pot-plant: you have to stake it when young
in order to agree with him. It is not clear what the experts think about the
bright white Lavatera Mont Blanc.
Lloyd complains about it, but the book gives it a glamorous full-colour
plate. Rice is good on the purple-flowered Swan River Daisy, which he wisely
recommends for hanging baskets because it will put up with drought. It needs
heat, however, in order to germinate.
What, finally, about seed-boxes and composts? I use old Flora Margarine
boxes or the small plastic pots in which plants come nowadays from
nurseries. The experts agree, surely rightly, that pots are more convenient,
as you can sow many more varieties in a small space. Do not bother with big
plastic trays. The days have also passed in which we had to use wooden
seed-boxes, fresh from fishmongers and smelling of kippers.
On composts, the two of them are still stuck with peat, but mostly as part
of a general compost. Personally, I have never used peat at all. I have
preferred good top-soil from the garden, which is carefully sieved, like
flour, and mixed with leaf-mould and sharp sand. I have also used
vermiculite and perlite, both of which help seeds to germinate: however,
both of them persist in the soil afterwards, and seedlings anyway need
something stronger very soon. A very few, very difficult seeds perhaps need
peat to hold water and keep the surrounding soil open, but I must insist
that my peat-free successes have included seed of gentians, hardy cyclamen
and various lilies.
Some while ago, I also gave up buying bags of special seed-compost because
it becomes lumpy when it is watered and it is too fine to handle easily. As
an amateur, my reasoning is much simpler. When nature sows seeds, she drops
them in all manner of rough, uneven earth; when I sow outdoors, I make seeds
put up with whatever the flower bed already offers.
Why go mad on peat because you happen to be sowing the same bedding-plants
in a pot or margarine box? I win some, lose some, but so (I suspect) do the
peat-fanciers. The one cloud on the horizon is that my traditional laziness
is now ecologically pure. But that is a prejudice for another time.

offered at Pounds 3.5m late in 1987 and subject to fiercely competitive
bidding - was eventually bought for a fraction under Pounds 5m, in spite of
needing another Pounds 2m of upgrading work.
Within months of the purchase the planned sale of the new owners' business
fell through and the house had to be offered for resale privately. Many
visitors and countless trips to the bank later, the house was finally sold
earlier this year for just Pounds 2.5m - a 100 per cent discount before
costs on what the vendor admits to have been, in retrospect, a reckless
price.
A London Docklands' penthouse - bought with an 80 per cent staff bank
mortgage for Pounds 475,000 in June 1987. The keys were posted to the
lenders mid-1990 by the Australian owner who left London six months after
being laid off by the bank. He'd simply given up trying to keep pace with
loan costs. The flat was re-sold for Pounds 285,000 earlier this year, a 40
per cent discount on the purchase price. The lender has accepted that the
gap between the mortgage plus rolled-up interest charges and the resale
price has to be written off.
A substantial North London detached house - bought for Pounds 875,000 in
June 1988. Re-offered for sale at 'over Pounds 900,000' in March 1990, the
price was cut to Pounds 825,000 in June 1990 and cut again to Pounds 750,000
by new agents in September 1990. It was re-marketed on the basis of 'offers
over Pounds 700,000' last October and was subject to a bid at Pounds 710,000
that month. Before the owners had time to put away the celebratory
champagne, that offer fell through. The house was finally sold for Pounds
740,000 in February this year after the owners had initially received two
identical offers of Pounds 725,000. The sale represents an 18 per cent
discount on the purchase price after two and a half years of costs and a
near divorce.
A 1950s semi-detached former council house bought on a 40 per cent discount
by the tenants for Pounds 42,000 in December 1988. Resold in a lot with six
other houses and flats at auction by the mortgagees after a repossession
sale for Pounds 35,000 in May 1990, and resold within days by the
trader-purchaser for Pounds 68,000 - in line with its estimated market value
two and a quarter years ago.
Private resales in flat blocks where the owner has to compete with developer
sales - no developer discounts or offers special mortgage rates, so the only
sale incentive is price.
The best of the Docklands flats in Wapping and the Isle of Dogs - now
discounted to levels that offer double-figure returns in a lively rental
market. The supply of waterfront flats is thin after two years with no new
schemes and anyone able to take a three to four year view on values should
see substantial capital growth.
Fully modernised family homes in prime central London - never out of fashion
and increasingly back in demand.
West Country and Hereford houses - an area too far away for Londoners who
cannot work some of the week at home, but who bought anyway in the late
1980s.
The cheapest Costa del Sol flats - there is virtually no holiday resale
market for these now and new developments aim to provide far larger and
better quality accommodation but there is growing local demand for staff and
low cost housing, and no supply.
Repossession properties - with professional advice only from auctions.
Beware the long unsold property re-branded as a 'no offers bargain'. That's
often a way of attracting scavenger bidders without any change to the asking
price. Also beware of priced properties, since every property for sale in
the country has been termed 'realistic' in recent months whether it is
cheap, fairly valued or outrageously over-priced.
'Guide prices' can be equally misleading as the term might best be described
as a figure reflecting hope over experience; it's left to the buyer discover
whether that's a vendor's hope over agency's experience, or not.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Gardening: The red roses of Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MORE than a century Northern Ireland has had an influence in the rose
world totally out of proportion to its size. For much of that time this was
due to the Dickson and McGredy families growing and breeding roses there.
Even when Sam McGredy transferred all his rose breeding to New Zealand, the
stream of fine new roses from Northern Ireland continued to flow from Pat
Dickson.
Something about the climate here and maybe also about the soil seems
specially favourable for roses; an equability of temperature combined with
an abundance of atmospheric moisture that seems to give rose blossoms a
little extra quality and clarity of colour. Maybe there is an element of
sentiment in this view but I have heard many rose experts express it.
In 1964 the Rose Society of Northern Ireland was founded as a totally
separate organisation and in 1981 the RSNI was accepted as a member of the
World Federation of Rose Societies. The appropriate reward is that, this
year, the World Federation has chosen Northern Ireland as the country to
host its ninth World Rose Convention and has arranged a very full and
attractive programme of events to be held before, during and after the
Convention under the title Rose Emerald 1991.
The Convention itself will take place in Belfast between Monday July 15 and
Sunday July 21 and will be centred in Queen's University where there will be
lectures and exhibitions. Two rose shows will be staged here exclusively for
new roses exhibited by international rose breeders and two more shows will
be for both new and old roses.
Since 1965 the city of Belfast Rose trials have been held in the Sir Thomas
and Lady Dixon Park and are judged every year by an international panel of
rose experts. Rose Emerald 1991 is timed to coincide with the closing stages
of this year's judging of these ongoing trials and there will be a conducted
tour of them for convention delegates.
Other visits and tours have been arranged for Convention Week: a civic
reception hosted by Belfast City Council at City Hall, Belfast; a Government
Reception at Greenmount College, Antrim; a gala banquet at Europa Hotel,
Belfast; an Irish night in association with the Industrial Development Board
of Northern Ireland, also at the Europa Hotel; and a Gala Concert in
association with Ulster Television.
Among the tours arranged during the convention is one to Mount Stewart House
and Gardens which I would specially recommend for this is a remarkable
place; a fine 18th century mansion with a very large garden much of which
was planned and planted after 1920 by the Seventh Marchioness of
Londonderry. It is highly original in design, very beautiful and contains a
number of unusual plants. July is an excellent month to see it.
It is also a good time to see many other gardens and the organisers of Rose
Emerald 1991 have taken advantage of this to plan three tours, one to take
place the week before the convention and two more the week following it.
The first of these will start in London on Sunday July 7 and travel
northwards visiting the Royal National Rose Society's large display garden
and trial grounds near St Albans and finishing in Glasgow on July 15 in good
time to get to Belfast the following day. Among the gardens to be visited on
the way are Blenheim Palace, Chatsworth House, Harlow Carr, which is the
garden of the Northern Horticultural Society, and the Royal Botanic Garden,
Edinburgh.
After the convention delegates can return for a further four days min
England, starting at Kew Gardens on Monday, July 22 and then spending a
whole day at the Royal National Rose Society's garden at St Albans, another
day in the Royal Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley and then a day in
Oxford with a further opportunity to look at Blenheim Palace and its
strongly contrasted formal and landscape gardens.
The alternative, post-convention tour is in southern Ireland, starting and
finishing in Dublin and lasting a week from July 22 to 28. The gardens to be
visited include the spectacular Powerscourt among the Wicklow Mountains and
also a unique Japanese Garden at Tully House, Kildare.
It also includes much of the finest south western coastal scenery and passes
through Glengarriff from which launches ply to tiny Garinish Island entirely
filled by a superb garden partly in Italian style, and with dramatic scenery

FT  04 MAY 91 / Travel: Exertion by day and indulgence by night - Eschew
Watneys beer and gala nights for a remarkable beauty-filled landscape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GILBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'MAJORCA? Ma-jor-ca?' People pronounce the name quizzically, then narrow
their eyes and curl their lips a little as you explain to them why you have
been there twice in the last year and can't wait to return when the next
off-peak season arrives.
We all know that Majorca is the single most popular holiday destination for
the British - upwards of 1.6m of them go there. So it seems like a
dereliction of duty to join the massed hordes in search of sun and sangria
in the Balearics instead of heading towards a newly-discovered retreat in
Bulgaria or Guinea-Bissau.
Yet the vast majority of British tourists are content to huddle together in
one small part of what is still, paradoxically, a secret island.
They clutter a 50-mile south-western stretch of Majorca's 200-mile coastline
in high summer, and do not seem aware that even a short walk inland would
reveal another island entirely.
No Watneys beer on tap, no hotels that look like Sing-Sing and offer gala
nights. Instead, there is a remarkable landscape filled with orange and
lemon groves, mountain ranges, bays and inlets, orchids, almond blossom,
pine forests, rare birds and superb walks.
The ground-rules for enjoying this other Majorca are simple: ignore July and
August, avoid the concrete jungles around the Bay of Palma, alternate the
beach life with adventurous walks and pack a copy of Landscapes of Mallorca
by Valerie Crespi-Green.
The island, shaped like a conch shell, owes its remarkably pleasant climate
to two ranges of craggy mountains, the Tramuntana along the north coast and
the Llevante on the east coast. These protect the inland areas against cold
winds and offer shade for the plains full of orange and lemon orchards and
olive trees.
To enjoy the contrasts of Majorca I split my stay between a small hotel, the
Mar y Vent, in the secluded fishing village of Banalbufar on the west coast,
and a larger hotel, the Bon Sol, in Illetas, just 8km outside Palma. These
hotels are family-run, now a rarity in Majorca as in many other places.
Banalbufar is so small that most tourists drive right through it, which is
good news for those who stay at the Mar y Vent. The Vives family has been
running the hotel since 1932 and its superb location makes it ideal for
those who want to explore the area on foot. Banalbufar teeters on cliff
edges and the hotel is perched on a hillside overlooking the sea. The
village has the best example of Majorca's remarkable stone-stepped terraces
which cover the hills in many parts. These terraces originated with the
Moorish occupation and are an ingenious aid to growing fruit and tomatoes.
A comfortable hotel and access to good walking routes are the two essential
ingredients for a successful break in Majorca.
Exertion by day and self-indulgence by night make an ideal combination. The
Bon Sol in Illetas caters for this kind of balanced regime.
It looks like a well-preserved Spanish country house with traditional
architecture, objets d'art rescued from monasteries, antique furniture and
flourishing gardens dotted with cacti and palm trees. It feels like a large
private house because that is what it was before it became a hotel in 1953.
The ebullient owner, Martin Xamena, and his English wife tell the story of
how Martin's father built the Bon Sol on a deserted site overlooking the
sea, surrounded by pine woods, years before the Palma area became a tourist
centre. Despite its 100 rooms, it still feels more like a friendly country
mansion than a hotel.
The Bon Sol is an ideal base for walkers. If you have a hired car you can
drive to the starting-point of nearby walks or (as I did) use a combination
of the excellent local bus services and cheap taxis.
Valerie Crespi-Green, an Englishwoman who has lived on the island for many
years, is adding some new walks for a new edition of her Landscapes of
Mallorca, so we took up the challenge to road-test one of the new routes
with her.
We met in Deya, high in the mountains, where the rugged landscape and superb
sea views have attracted writers and artists for years. Robert Graves lived
here from the 1930s until his death and is buried in the village cemetery.
Valerie Crespi-Green grades all her walks, ranging from easy to strenuous.
Our route, Deya to Soller, was over five miles but I was relieved to learn
that it was rated as ideal for beginners (my own grade) because of the
absence of steep climbs. Much of the walk was over ancient cobblestones,
using the old path that used to be the only trail for locals to ride from
Deya to Soller. We followed the author's written directions and found them
clear and accurate.
During the two-hour walk we did not see another soul. With only the
occasional sheep-bell to break the silence and the sight of an odd goat
munching away outside a deserted 13th-century chapel, it was strange to
realise that we were not so far from the saturated tower blocks of Magaluf
and Arenal.
Wild orchids, euphorbia, Balearic crocuses, clematis and violets lined the
route, which has dramatic views of the coastline and mountains, including
the highest peak on the island, Puig Major.
According to a keen walker there are 650 muscles in the human body and every
time you go on a decent walk you use 50 per cent of them: his words came
back to me as we walked down to Soller, with its small fishing harbour and
clattering wooden train that runs to Palma. We took the narrow-gauge railway
that hugs the orange groves so tightly that you can almost pick the fruit as
you judder along.
Back at the Bon Sol we had the chance to sample authentic local cooking with
Martin and Lorraine Xamena as our guides. They took us along hairpin bends
and up a corkscrew road to a village called Genova where the Na Burguesa
restaurant has a spectacular view over the Bay of Palma.
Majorcan food is ideal for trenchermen - or anyone who works up an appetite
after a healthy walk. Pa omb oli is the classic local starter: country bread
covered with ham, olive oil and tomatoes. The robust wines go well with the
house special, cordero al homo, leg of lamb. When they say leg, they mean
leg. A complete leg or shoulder was served to everyone.
For my last walk I was content to pack a rucksack with some freshly-baked
bread and cold meats, oranges and a bottle of local white. We took the bus
from Palma to Puerto Pollensa in the north of the island, a quiet resort
with wide beaches that has managed to hold off the greediest developers.
The walk from Puerto Pollensa through the Boquer valley is one of the most
popular in Valerie Crespi-Green's book: six kilometres of rugged landscapes,
pines, jagged cliffs and a windy valley that is popular with keen
bird-watchers ('twitchers') because of the many rare birds that can be seen.
Twitchers from all over Europe regularly take this walk because of the
chance to glimpse black-eared wheat-eaters, rock-thrushes, kestrels,
peregrines, even the scops owl.
One twitcher told me that the biggest thrill of his fortnight in Majorca was
catching sight of Eleonora's falcon and a Marmora's warbler. I can hardly
tell a robin from a raven but we did spot a vulture swooping along the
mountainside.
The walk ends in an isolated cove with the enormous rock of Es Colomer
jutting out from the Formentor coastline. As we sat on rocks at the cove and
let the waves cool our feet, I laid my bottle of white wine in a rock pool.
Within a few minutes it was chilled enough to drink and ready us for the
return journey.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Travel: A good place to hear yourself think - The wilds of
Scotland's Ardnamurchan peninsula
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCENE I: It is 5pm on a late-April Sunday and I am sitting at a place near
the end of the Ardnamurchan peninsula in the north-western highlands of
Scotland, gazing across a short stretch of sea into the mouth of the Sound
of Mull.
The sun is out and the sea only gently tousled by the wind. Mull itself is
coloured like a painting by an Australian Impressionist: blue, black, grey,
fawn and the colour that is not green and not black but somewhere in
between.
In the right foreground is a small bay with grass growing up to the shingle
and sheep and lambs wandering eccentrically among the rockpools. In the left
foreground is the toy ruin of Mingary castle, or at least the ruin of the
small part of it that survives, toy-like and forgotten.
I think: perhaps what I am enjoying - the view, the quiet, the orderliness -
is what is called serenity, for the view across to Mull has only ever been
interrupted or in any great way modified by volcanoes and glaciers, and then
not recently, so that what I am looking at probably pre-dates human
consciousness.
I think this to be the case because I am not the sort of person who believes
that things only exist - saucepans, Scottish landscapes - if there is
someone there to observe them. What exists, I am sure, is blue, black, grey,
fawn and the colour that is not black and not green.
Scene II: 10am the following day. It is cold and not inspiring. I am at the
lighthouse at Ardnamurchan point, the most westerly tip of the British
mainland. It must be charming in the summer but in late April it is bleak
and gale-swept. To the north-west are the islands of Muck, Eigg and Rhum;
beyond, Canna, Barra, South Uist and Benbecula.
The Ardnamurchan lighthouse was built in 1849 by Robert Louis Stevenson's
uncle. Nowadays the ground and out-buildings - but not the lighthouse tower
 -are owned by Peter de Savary, the property developer and America's Cup
challenger, who also owns Land's End and John o'Groats and thus holds sway
over the most southerly, northerly and westerly tips of Britain.
On my way down to my car I peer into a small wind-shielded ravine and notice
a scattering of primroses gleaming so luridly and unexpectedly that they
might have been borne there by interstellar gusts.
I think: what strangeness is it in his nature that compels a hot-shot like
de Savary to buy up the most southerly, northerly and westerly points of
Britain? I could ring him on his car-phone and ask him to explain. But then
I think: he probably wouldn't know, is too rich to care, is rich enough, at
any rate, to regard the question as far more odd than any possible answer.
Scene III: I am now at Glenborrodale Castle, a luxury hotel (also owned by
de Savary) which is halfway along the peninsula and surrounded by
magnificent gardens. I am reading a small book by Jimmie Macgregor -
Macgregor Across Scotland, BBC Books, Pounds 4.99 - in which the wee pundit
describes walking from the Scurdie Ness lighthouse near Montrose on the
Scottish east coast to the Ardnamurchan light on the west, and calls
Ardnamurchan 'an almost perfect place.'
He is right, for the peninsula is wild and beautiful, a haven for all sorts
of creatures - wildcat, otter, golden eagle, pine marten, badger  - though
not immune to the influence of 'incomers,' people moving in from England and
pushing up property prices which means that the locals have to leave and the
old crofting ways die.
According to Macgregor: 'The oft-proffered argument that there are many
Scots in England is a weak one. There are 5m Scots and 50m English, and the
fact is that Scots go to England because they need money, and the English
can move to Scotland because they have it.'
I think: the arrival of incomers is inevitable and not at all tragic. Few of
us live where we would most like to live (Palm Springs, in my case;
Belgravia at a pinch). I think: If people in Scotland have to move south to
earn some money then they are at liberty to move back again once they have
made it. But then I think: that sounds like Norman Tebbit, which upsets me
so violently I almost have an accident.
Scene IV: I am now at Corran, at the eastern end of the peninsula, waiting
for the ferry so that I can cross Loch Linnhe for the short drive to Fort
William where I will catch the night train to London.
It is a hobby of mine when waiting for transport to study the rules and
conditions laid down by the transport company. The Corran ferry is operated
by the Highland Regional Council, a cautious body to judge from its
'conditions of carriage,' two of which state:
'The Council shall be entitled in their absolute discretion and without
assigning any reason to refuse to receive or ship any goods or vehicle, or
any part thereof, or any passenger.
'The Council are not liable for failure to operate the ferries at the
scheduled times, or at all, and they are not liable for any loss, damage or
injury resulting from delays, through whatever cause arising.'
I think: that just about covers it.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Travel News: French breaks in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETER Mayle may have done more for holidays in France than all the
carefully-laid plans of clever advertising agencies, such as those for which
he used to work. Mayle's book, A Year in Provence, and his newly-published
Toujours Provence have apparently stimulated UK demand for French holidays.
Travel agency Thomas Cook reports that holidays to France are running at a
level 60 per cent higher than this time last year.
A leading independent specialist, VFB Holidays, believes that Mayle has had
a marked impact: a third of a sample survey of 5,000 clients it quizzed last
year mentioned A Year in Provence as required reading, not just for Provence
but for how it represented life throughout rural France.
VFB says that while Provence and the Provence-Rhone regions are selling
exceptionally well, the Cote d'Azur is not. Other French specialists, such
as Kingsland Holidays and Allez France, also report that Provence is the
star performer, although another specialist, La France des Villages,
believes that Provence is too expensive for many Britons: the Burgundy
region is its most popular destination.
The overall holiday picture this summer is looking considerably brighter
than had seemed likely earlier this year. Mass-market travel agent Lunn Poly
says that trade has picked up sharply for Mediterranean package holidays.
But up-market American Express Travel says that the anticipated post-Gulf
war boom in bookings has not been as extensive as hoped. 'Independent travel
in America, however, is doing very well,' says Barry Tyrell, Amex Travel's
marketing director.
The Association of Independent Tour Operators reports that Italy and in-land
Spain are among the most popular destinations at present, with a resurgent
interest in Cyprus. But it says that bookings for Greece and Turkey are
still taking time to recover from the effects of the war. Perhaps Peter
Mayle might be lured there by some enterprising tourist board?
THE government's decision to open up Heathrow airport to all-comers, after
years of restrictions, has given new opportunities to several carriers to
compete more effectively against British Airways. Cathay Pacific, voted
favourite airline of Holiday Which? readers, this week started a daily
non-stop service to Hong Kong from Heathrow after 10 years' lobbying. Later
this month, Owners Abroad is operating the first charter flight out of
Heathrow for two decades: to Faro in Portugal.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Books: Reminiscing over raki - Crete: The Battle and the
Resistance by Anthony Beevor John Murray Pounds 19.95, 383 pages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIFTY YEARS ago on May 20 the German parachute attack on Crete started one
of the most bizarre - and moving - dramas of the Second World War, the short
and disastrous Battle of Crete followed by the long, successful Resistance
which tied down many German troops who could have been in Italy in 1943. Its
high point is legend, filmed as Ill Met By Moonlight, when Patrick
Leigh-Fermor's band captured General Kreipe, the commander of Heraklion,
near Knossos, led him across snow-covered Mount Ida, and sent him off to
Egypt in a submarine.
The Germans set off thinking the Cretans would welcome them. But the Cretans
had got rid of the Turks only 40 years before, after deeds of bravado and
self-sacrifice such as when the Abbot of Arkadi in 1866 set fire to the
monastery's powder magazine rather than surrender. Now it was the Nazis. The
choice was the same: Freedom or Death.
There was really no choice, even if the Cretan Division was stuck on the
Albanian border. (Many times have I heard, over raki in the cafe, 'if only
they had been here . . .') The old men, and women, and children, took up
their farm tools and shotguns. The prisoners were let out. And the Germans
thought it was unfair because the locals were not in uniform so they started
reprisals, which strengthened the feeling against them.
For the survivors of the motley group of British, Australian and New Zealand
defenders of Crete, the memory of the courage, generosity and serious
drinking of the Cretans does not fade. Ask those taken prisoner. On the long
road to camp Cretans gave them food and drink constantly, even if it meant
none for themselves. But British senior officers had been eager to get out
and leave troops behind, as Evelyn Waugh showed in Officers and Gentlemen -
partly in self-disgust, Antony Beevor explains. To Waugh, some of the
British in Crete epitomised the collapse of behaviour and society during the
war.
When the first German fell from the sky, the Resistance began. And if the
alliance was short of wirelesses and weapons, it was not lacking in spirit.
They very nearly held Crete. German losses of crack troops were so high on
the first day that they did not see how they could win. And they never again
attempted a parachute attack, though the Allies continued till Arnhem.
Unimaginative command, staying back and doing too little too late, lost the
Allies Crete. The one moment of supreme advantage was when the invaders
arrived. Yet there was no decision to hold Maleme airfield near Chania at
any cost, and Hill 107 above it was abandoned on the first night when the
Germans though they were lost. The First World War hero General Freyberg was
so convinced that the main attack would be by sea that he misread accurate
information from Ultra intercepts and held his reserves back in a campaign
hardly longer than the land phase of the Gulf war.
Crete was a major minor disaster, which Beevor analyses judiciously in this
lucid, readable book which is set to become the standard work. Having tried
its predecessors, I now at last understand what happened in the battle. It
is also the first comprehensive account of the disruptive exploits of the
dashing young men of the Resistance - Leigh-Fermor, Xan Fielding,
archaeologists such as Tom Dunbabin and Terence Bruce-Mitford, Mikis
Akoumianos (the son of Sir Arthur Evans' foreman) and Constantinos
Mitsotakis, the present Greek PM. Beevor includes most of the stories but
leaves out the strange moment of communion on Mount Ida when Kreipe started
and Leigh-Fermor finished Horace's poem about Monte Soratte in snow.
I also wanted more of the whiff of Crete, 'blood and slaughter and garlic'
as Nicholas Hammond wrote later. Has Beevor sat in the sun on Mount Ida and
heard an elder of Anoyia tell how, in court after the war, he killed the
collaborator who had shot his brother and then walked over to the prosecutor
and handed him his knife? Has he heard the cafe-owner's wife shrieking at
the men for being sentimental about the Resistance when 'the Germans did not
just kill our men, they killed the goats and shot holes in our olive oil
tanks. Our village died for 25 years'?
More time over the raki hearing the songs and legends which keep the war
alive today would have made the book yet stronger. But we hope to find them
one day in Patrick Leigh-Fermor's great yet-to-be written work on Crete.
An exhibition called 'Touch and Go: the Battle for Crete, 1941' opens at the
National Army Museum, Royal Hospital Road, London SW3 on May 17.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Books: To the leader born - A Question of Leadership:
Gladstone to Thatcher by Peter Clarke Hamish Hamilton Pounds 17.99, 344pages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETER CLARKE is a Cambridge historian with a distinctive style which lends
itself easily to parody. His book on British leaders from Gladstone to
Thatcher is not entirely new, since he has written some of the essays before
in other places. Nor does it claim to be comprehensive: Clarke takes the
view that some of those who did not quite make it to the top are at least as
interesting as some of those who did. In other words, he picks and chooses,
although the basis for the choice is not always entirely clear.
There is said to be an after-dinner game of discussing who was the best
British prime minister this century. That is rather a macro-affair, and
anyway depends on definitions (what does one mean by best?) and a certain
detachment from the subject. Clarke's approach is decidedly micro: he is
very good at producing quotations, usually without the source. He has read
widely and sometimes gives the impression of having borrowed heavily: for
example, from DR Thorpe's book on Selwyn Lloyd. A more appropriate game to
play with Clarke might be: which is his best essay in this collection?
Some of his contributions are very good, though more by fits and starts than
sustained writing. He is not without some good phrases of his own, unless
one has missed the source. For instance, he describes Thatcher as rampaging
from summit to summit 'as a sort of fishwife Britannia demanding her money
back'. On Harold Macmillan's dismissal of Dean Acheson - who said that
Britain had lost an empire and not found a role - as a 'conceited ass',
Clarke writes: 'The notion that the emperor had no clothes, as seemed
devastatingly obvious to these foreigners, was somehow regarded as capable
of refutation by shutting one's eyes and thinking of Winston Churchill'.
Clarke's best essay is on Neville Chamberlain. It takes a kind of courage to
say, as Chamberlain did on being offered the Treasury: 'I remain convinced
that I might be a great minister of health but am not likely to be more than
a second-rate chancellor'. Clarke tells the story of Chamberlain's early
years trying unsuccessfully to grow sisal in the Caribbean. Churchill did
not know it until 50 years later and described Chamberlain when he heard it
as 'a hard-bitten pioneer from the outer marches of the British Empire.'
Gladstone and Thatcher had a great deal in common, writes Clarke, since both
were moralists, though he acknowledges that Thatcher owed much to Enoch
Powell: 'Enoch the Baptist,' as he calls him, rather than Enoch the
parliamentary leper.
There are lots of insights like that, and Clarke can be good on economic
questions. He has, after all, written a book called The Keynesian Revolution
in the Making, which he draws on here. His essays are in general very
entertaining, though somewhat mannered. If he goes on like this, and can
resist the temptation to be too clever by half, he will make an excellent
newspaper columnist, of which he has most of the attributes already.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Books: Genius with a capital G - Goethe: The Poet And The
Age, Volume 1, 1749-1790 by Nicholas Boyle Oxford Pounds 25, 807 pages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERE IS a biographical marathon, comparable in size to Ackroyd's Dickens and
Holroyd's Shaw, but with much firmer control over the vast material. It is a
most rewarding run for anyone, German-speaking or not, prepared to summon
the stamina. The course begins in 18th century Frankfurt where Goethe was
brought-up by his affluent, self-made father. Papa Goethe's early ambitions
for his son lay in the law, which Goethe studied in Leipzig. He was also
encouraged to travel and become an educated man.
This takes him - and us - to various parts of what was still the Holy Roman
Empire and to Switzerland, after which the volume is concerned with Goethe's
existence in the Thuringian duchy of Saxe-Weimar. Goethe stayed there for
much of his life, and this big volume, sub-titled The Poetry of Desire
(1749-1790), is only half of the story. He is 40 when it ends, and he lived
into his 80s. Part two, The Age of Renunciation, 1790-1832, is
'forthcoming'. When that appears, the pair of volumes will surely stand for
many years as the definitive biography.
Goethe was the first German literary man of universal importance. He wrote
prose, poetry, fiction, drama (plays such as Faust, Goetz von Berlichingen,
Iphigenia, Tasso, written primarily to be read rather than performed),
travel-reporting, autobiography, letters. He excelled at all these genres,
being adept in a wide variety of styles. Like Shakespeare, he unlocked the
hidden resources of his native language for literature. He was the also the
first German writer to be regarded by his contemporaries, and to regard
himself, as a Genius with a capital G.
He is a genius 'from top to toe' said one contemporary, implying that Goethe
was 'incapable of acting arbitrarily'. Not only did Goethe have this impact
on his own circle and on the wider public, he brought himself - more
precisely, the Self - into literature in a revolutionary fashion.
After publication of The Sorrows of Young Werther in 1774, which made an
enormous stir - young men committed suicide in droves in emulation of its
hero - practically everything Goethe did and said was recorded by someone.
To escape from his own cult Goethe left mercantile Frankfurt and the world
of his parents for aristocratic Weimar. He became a courtier, a Privy
Counsellor, an administrator.
After a while he was raised in rank and put von in front of his name. His
elevation enabled him to take on greater responsibilities. These included
managing a mining project at Ilmenau, negotiating with other ducal
principalities, attending committees concerned with public works and
finance. He was well-paid for these non-literary labours, but Goethe did not
thereby neglect his own writing. In his first period at Weimar he combined
his official functions with the composition of several of his most famous
works. One thinks of the American poet Wallace Stevens working full-time as
a top executive of the Hartford insurance company or Eliot in charge of the
foreign department at Lloyds Bank.
Soon after he arrived in Weimar, Goethe started a relationship with a
respectable Weimar lady, Frau Charlotte von Stein. Back home he had had his
youthful flings with women - see Werther - but this affair was strictly
platonic, taking the form of incessant letter-writing though the two parties
lived within walking-distance of each other. Although highly attractive to
women, Goethe deliberately abstained from sex during his early years in
Weimar. He broke that long fast at the end of his time in Rome with an
obscure young Italian woman. The precise details have here eluded Boyle.
Only when Goethe returned to Weimar aged nearly 40 did he enter into a
long-term sexual relationship. As the book ends, his mistress has born him a
son but Goethe is not yet married to her. Hearing of the affair, Frau von
Stein angrily breaks off communications, and then demands the return of all
her letters.
The Italian expedition permitted Goethe to indulge not only his love of
women and the company of artists like Tischbein and Angelica Kauffmann, but
also his love of painting and drawing; and it provided material for one of
his most accessible books, translated several times into English, the
Italian Journey.
That journey represented the second great change of environment for Goethe
described in this volume. It was one that had just as far-reaching
consequences for his work as the first. In discussing these, Boyle places
Goethe's poetry and fiction in various cultural contexts - philosophic,
scientific, political - all of which over-lapped in a period astonishingly
rich in intellectual development. Boyle also interrupts the flow of the
biographical narrative to reconstruct the process of composition of each of
Goethe's outpourings, with further comments on each work in more general
terms.
Some of the key terms stem from attitudes common to both English and German
literature. Thus the English reader who is not at home in German has a few
points of orientation. The word 'sentimental', for instance, is frequently
cited, not in its modern pejorative sense, but in the sense Sterne implied
in his title, A Sentimental Journey, meaning someone who reacts to
everything he sees from the heart. Taken over by Goethe and his fellow
writers, this kind of sentimental approach to life points to the literary
movement known as German Sentimentalism. Some of its attitudes then
re-appeared in Storm and Stress, the vogue-style that dominated much of the
period.
Another English writer who had a great influence in Germany was Defoe,
particularly Robinson Crusoe. Although the hero of this novel is not a
sentimentalist, he is 'the central point from which all structural lines
radiate outwards', comparable to the monad in the philosophy of Leibniz - a
concept crucial to much German imaginative writing in this period. These
gross simplifications of Boyle's subtle but never obscure line of exposition
will perhaps give an indication of the richness of thought to be sampled in
this book. It is a major contribution to the history of ideas in addition to
revealing, in much greater detail than hitherto, the extraordinary story of
Goethe's life.

SELECTED POEMS Derek Mahon Viking Pounds 14.00. 194 pages
LOVE IN A LIFE Andrew Motion Faber Pounds 11.99 hardback, Pounds 4.99
paperback, 62 pages
LIKE LOUIS MacNeice, Derek Mahon is an Irish poet (born in Belfast, 1941)
who eludes characterisation by his Irishness. His subjects are general, his
sensibility is that shared by all poets whose primary interest is in making
a variety of verbal objects and thereby, as he writes in the MacNeice
memorial poem which heads this new selection, 'keeping the colours new'.
Mahon's Irish interests are not repressed - in fact they are abounding; but
unlike his near-contemporary Seamus Heaney or Paul Muldoon (another devotee
of MacNeice) he does not seek to create an Irish myth of any sort.
Interested in everything, and infallibly interesting, he is simply and
thoroughly a poet in a way that not only recalls MacNeice, but the
distinctions of Auden, Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop too.
Like all those poets he is blessed with technical accomplishment. His
management of metrics, stanza and rhyme, his sure sense of the fine,
ringing, quirky, inevitable line, his eager appetite for, and seemingly
instant command of, new forms set him apart from most of his English and
American contemporaries, and they, on the whole, are a brilliant lot.
Reading through this book - his second selected volume, but with the feel of
a 'Collected' - one cannot fail to admire Mahon's knack of being himself in
whatever formal guise he adopts, be it epigram, short lyric, verse letter,
villanelle, dramatic monologue, free translation (Ovid, Corbiere, Rimbaud,
Pasternak, Jaccottet) or big stanza-statement poem. Every piece here is
fully achieved; the ambition behind the book must be enormous but is never
obtrusive.
Beyond the attributes of technique there is in Mahon's best poems an
endlessly ponderable richness of language, a sense of which may be gained
from the opening stanza of his most celebrated piece, 'A Disused Shed in Co.
Wexford': 'Even now there are places where a thought might grow - /Peruvian
mines, worked out and abandoned /To a slow clock of condensation, /An echo
trapped for ever, and a flutter /Of wild-flowers in the lift-shaft, /Indian
compounds where the wind dances /And a door bangs with diminished
confidence, /Lime crevices behind rippling rain-barrels, /Dog corners for
bone burials; /And in a disused shed in Co. Wexford'.
This poem expands on what might be thought of as Mahon's principal theme:
the pathos of discarded things, the poetry of the contingency of everyday
objects. 'Left to itself,' he writes in 'Disused Shed's' sister-poem, 'A
Garage in Co. Cork', 'the functional will cast /A death-bed glow of
picturesque abandon'. The poet's visionary task is no longer to descry
Wordsworth's noble 'light that never was, on sea or land', so much as to
notice the 'late sacramental gleam' with which the most mediocre bits and
pieces of life will start to shine.
'We might be anywhere but are in one place only', he insists in this
Elizabeth Bishop-like reverie on an obscure, mundane filling-station, into
which he nevertheless manages to work, and charmingly, the Ovidian myth of
Philemon and Baucis. 'A god who spent the night here once rewarded /Natural
courtesy with eternal life - /Changing to petrol pumps, that they be spared/
For ever there, an old man and his wife'.
It is one of the triumphs of Mahon's art that for all his resolute attention
to the ordinary, he can be 'myth-kitty' in a powerfully plausible way to
which Philip Larkin who coined the phrase could not reasonably have
objected, as when in the book's grand finale, 'Death and the Sun', he
imagines 'Plato's neolithic troglodyte /Released from his dark cinema'
standing at last, 'Absurd and anxious, out in the open air', while (in a
wonderful concluding flow of mixed metaphor) the 'Sun gongs its lenity from
a brazen heaven /Listening in silence to his rich despair'.
If Mahon in this hugely enjoyable gathering of poems shows himself to be
free from any Irish stereotyping, the quintessentially English poet Andrew
Motion in his bleakly impressive new collection, Love in a Life, gives the
impression of wanting to emulate the linguistic violence and tonal daring of
his Irish contemporaries Paul Muldoon and Tom Paulin. A bitter colloquialism
constantly threatens the poised lyrical structures of the book's three short
sections and actually causes 'The Vision of that Ancient Man' to abort: it
ends 'like . . . Sod it; who cares?'
But in breaking with traditional values, Motion gives striking expression to
a burdened breadwinner's view of the modern world as endlessly aggravating,
rawly inhospitable. The sad old whippet in 'It is an Offence' who regularly
leaves his 'sloped, weary turds' by the poet's front door 'doesn't know he's
doing, and yet /I'd still like to cover his arsehole with quick-set cement'.
That is very much the mood of the book.

THE TERRORS OF ICE AND DARKNESS by Christoph Ransmayr Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson
Pounds 14, 198 pages
A SOLITARY GRIEF by Bernice Rubens Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 13.95, 240
pages
THE DEATH OF DAVID DEBRIZZI by Paul Micou Bantam Pounds 13.99, 271 pages
NOT THE END OF THE WORLD by Rebecca Stowe Peter Owen Pounds 12.95, 152 pages
PINOCCHIO IN VENICE by Robert Coover Heinemann Pounds 14.99, 330 pages
PICTURE THIS. You're stuck in the ice somewhere up near the North Pole. It
has just got dark and isn't going to get light again for several months. You
have managed to kill and eat a polar bear, but there wasn't anything in its
stomach when you cut it up, and you have no idea where your next polar bear
is coming from. What do you do?
Put a message in a bottle, that's what. Throw it into the sea and hope
someone will find it. They do, but not for another 48 years, which isn't
what you had in mind at all. You have long since succumbed to The Terrors of
Ice and Darkness, to the miseries of scurvy, a slow death by starvation and
numbing, bitter cold.
Not only that, but your story is true as well, dressed up as fiction by
Christoph Ransmayr. He has taken the logbook and private diaries of a
long-forgotten polar journey - the Austro-Hungarian expedition of 1873,
which discovered Franz-Josef Land - and grafted onto them a fictitious
retracing of the Austrians' steps, allegedly undertaken by a young Italian
in 1981.
Mazzini is the Italian's name, a lorry driver and part-time writer, who
since childhood has dreamed of little except exploring. Fired by an account
of the earlier expedition, he abandons home and job and sets off for Oslo,
determined to follow the same route as his predecessors. Well-wishers try to
dissuade him, but Mazzini is adamant. He heads north - the account of his
journey is interspersed with reports of the genuine journey - and
disappears, never to be seen again. The way Ransmayr tells it, he may be out
there still, his frozen corpse just waiting to be discovered.
Gripping stuff, although it has to be said that the novel works best when
the author is dealing with the genuine expedition, quoting verbatim from an
appalling account of privation and despair, rather than with his fictional
additions. But the story is no less interesting for that. It is the sort of
book that will be enjoyed best under a warm blanket, with food on the table,
a cup of cocoa to hand, and the central heating turned up.
Still in sombre mood, A Solitary Grief, by Bernice Rubens, tells the tale of
psychiatrist Alistair Crown, who is reduced to despair when his only child
is born with Down's Syndrome. He reacts, as many parents would, with horror
at first, than with anger and resentment. 'They're very affectionate
children,' the nurse tells him at the hospital, but Alistair doesn't want to
know. He cannot even bring himself to look at his daughter's face, let along
accept responsibility for her. He leaves home instead, has an affair with
another woman, moves in with one of his patients - an abnormally hairy man
named Esau, who has come to terms with his own deformity . . .
Yet Alistair loves the child. He goes in to her at night, spending time
alone with her in the dark, cradling the face he has never seen. He loves
his daughter in secret, unwilling to admit his love even to himself, let
alone his estranged wife. Nobody is more upset than he when the child goes
missing and the police search the area for a body. He concedes at last that
the girl is a part of him, his own flesh and blood.
All of which makes A Solitary Grief sound fairly depressing, which it is, up
to a point. But the author handles a difficult subject very well, without
undue sentimentality, and brings the story to a suitably shattering climax.
It is impossible in the end not to feel great sympathy for Alistair, even
though he is far from being the hero of the piece.
Paul Micou gained a reputation as something of a humorist with his first two
novels, but has gone for a more restrained approach with his third, although
his observation is as sharp as ever. The Death of David Debrizzi purports to
be the biography - by his friend and teacher - of a young French concert
pianist, a child prodigy who was internationally famous from a very early
age. It takes the form of an open letter to a rival for Debrizzi's
friendship, who has published a biography of his own.
The rival's biography was biassed and self-serving in the extreme, an
attempt to steal the credit for Debrizzi's success. Debrizzi's teacher sets
the record straight, in a chapter by chapter rebuttal of the other's
extravagant claims. What emerges between the two of them is a good portrait
of the pianist, and of the concert world in general. The author is clearly a
music buff and lets his enthusiasm shine through, telling a good story with
considerable expertise.
Not the End of the World is a first novel by Rebecca Stowe, a young American
from Port Huron, Michigan. Her heroine is from Michigan too, a bright
12-year-old who wishes she was a boy, but will settle instead for becoming
the first woman governor of the state. The story is one of childhood, of a
rebellious girl with churchgoing parents and problems with teachers and
social workers. It is a spritely tale, engaging enough as far as it goes.
The only drawback is that the heroine's childhood doesn't appear to be any
different from that of millions of other Americans, either in fact or in
fiction.
Last, but not necessarily least, Robert Coover's Pinocchio in Venice is a
reworking of the children's story, with Pinocchio as an old man this time,
returning to Venice after a lifetime in America as a college professor. He
is anxious to complete his final work, a tribute to the Blue-Haired Fairy,
before he turns back into wood again. The idea is an intriguing one, if you
like that sort of thing, but the author's approach is heavily intellectual
and some people may feel baffled by the length of his sentences, which
routinely run to 250 words or more.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Books: Confessions of an author - Patrimony: A True Story by
Philip Roth Jonathan Cape Pounds 13.99, 238 pages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THINGS that wear you down are also the things that nurture your talent.
For Philip Roth, those things are family matters. With Patrimony, he squares
up to his father in an uncomfortable display of candour. This confessional
writing follows Joseph Heller, William Styron and John Updike into the
rediscovered country of one's past. It represents a new and growing American
genre: established novelists deliver the psychic truth about themselves.
Roth's story, however, is a piece of self-therapy too poignant to dismiss
and too blatant to be endured.
The family is not new Roth territory: he has been writing about Jewish
families ever since his first novel, Goodbye, Columbus (1960). His
characters have always, like Portnoy and Zuckerman, lived life not so much
with their heart on the sleeve as in the full glare of open-heart surgery.
But the intimacy they imposed made you feel prurient for being there.
The same force works in Patrimony and in his previous confession, The Facts
(1988). That feisty autobiography recorded the New Jersey upbringing, the
college days at Bucknell and Chicago, and the relentless accumulation of
material for his books.
Here in Patrimony Roth brings his belief in Jewish family indivisibility to
its natural term. He is confronted by an elderly father with a malignant
brain tumour. The unstinting surgical detail, leavened only by sporadic wit,
periodically gives way to a series of emotional encounters. Gradually the
entropy of age and the inexorable tumour bring them closer; even false
teeth: 'By taking the dentures, slimy saliva and all, and dumping them in my
pocket, I had, quite inadvertently, stepped across the divide of physical
estrangement that, not so unnaturally, had opened up between us once I had
stopped being a boy.'
His father had typified his time: a second- generation immigrant who lost
money in shoes and frozen food before becoming an insurance clerk with
Metropolitan Life. He was not only a family man, but president of an
association of 80 Jewish families in Newark and 70 in Boston; the
association Happy Day Fund took care of its sick, while its Education Fund
helped with college tuition. In a bluff, point-blank way, he was immensely
proud of his son. He defended Roth's books against Jewish charges of
anti-Semitism and self-hate. And while his life was not spectacular, Roth's
love for him makes it unique.
The story moves to its inevitable end in Herman's death. But while father
and son discuss the medical options presented by the growing tumour, the son
suddenly finds himself in the theatre with a quintuple bypass operation. He
tries to keep it from his father, and ends up in a tender family row. He
recovers, relieved to think that his father will not have to bury a son. The
book drips foreboding from every page.
This is a grim, harrowing read. When the final hospital and mortuary scenes
arrive, they are as depressing as Roth is elsewhere uplifting. He remarks
coolly that with the unseemliness of his profession, he had been writing
this book while his father lay ill and dying.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: The Young Lady says 'Yes]' - The 'most exhilarating
thing to happen to Irish theatre in recent years'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN DENIS Johnston's first play was turned down by the Abbey in the 1920's,
he did some rewriting and changed the title to The Old Lady Says 'No]'. The
joke was not lost on Dubliners. Lady Gregory, the old lady in question, was
the Abbey. And to her mind an expressionist play like Johnston's was simply
not Irish: it didn't have what she called 'PQ' - namely peasant quality.
There is a recognisable truth behind this. In a sense even O'Casey is PQ
transferred to the slums of Dublin. The formula produced masterpieces, like
The Playboy and O' Casey's own early works. It also provided Ireland with a
truly national theatre 60 years before Britain had one. But that does not
alter the fact that it was a formula; and formulas may be creative initially
but in the long term they stifle creativity.
At the beginning of this year the Old Lady's place was taken by a Young Lady
who is not likely to let herself be stifled. Garry Hynes is at 38 the most
exhilarating thing to happen to the Irish theatre in recent years. A tiny
woman with a will of iron, she is capable of dragging the Abbey into the
1990s, if anyone is.
Her road to success was an unlikely one. Together with some contemporaries
from University College, Galway, she founded the Druid Theatre in that city
in 1975. They started in a school hall and then moved into a room behind a
hotel. And it worked. 'My whole life in the theatre has been defined by a
sense of place,' she has said 'and I cannot separate the act of theatre from
the community in which it is performed.' The Druid developed a personal
style of production, combining freshness and an agreeable roughness. Its
greatest triumph was The Playboy, but it has also championed writers like
Tom Murphy and Eugene McCabe.
Garry Hynes then demonstrated that the Druid style could succeed outside her
home city. Since 1986 she has been doing one production a year at the Abbey
 -its current hit, The Shaughraun, is her work. She has also directed The
Man Of Mode and The Look Of The Nightingale for the RSC, and her Royal Court
production of Murphy's A Whistle In The Dark won the Time Out London Award
for Direction in 1988.
To discover the magnitude of the task facing her I spoke to Eintan O'Toole,
critic of the Irish Times, whom Ms Hynes has brought in as Literary Advisor.
He told me that the theatre had gone through a period of crisis since March
1985, when Joe Dowling resigned as Artistic Director. Some productions from
the Dowling era were artistic and commercial failures, and the board of
directors decided to play a more active role in day-to-day management. As a
result, no Artistic Director was prepared to stay; there were five in a
period of five years. The last, Noel Pearson, did much to get the theatre on
its feet again, but his film work (he produced My Left Foot and The Field)
took up an increasing proportion of his time.
One result of the uncertainty was that the Abbey lost any sense of its role
as an Irish National Theatre. 'The Abbey has tended to function on an Irish
idea of genius,' O'Toole told me. 'There are geniuses out there who produce
extraordinary work. This arrives on your desk and everybody says: Great,
let's do it.' Astonishingly, this passive policy has to an extent worked;
the geniuses have turned up. But, in the absence of a logical commissioning
policy, many areas of Irish life remained uncovered.
Garry Hynes, speaking of the community the Abbey should be addressing,
defined it as 'a set of concentric circles moving out to the immediate
context of Dublin itself, to the island as a whole - and in that I include
the North - to the scattered Irish communities of Britain, the US and indeed
the European Community.'
This is a highly ambitious programme, probably realisable only in an ideal
world. The initial list of productions is not wholly convincing: The Plough
and The Stars, opening in the main theatre on May 7, is probably unavoidable
with 1991 being the 75th anniversary of the Easter Rising: there is also a
production in the smaller hall, the Peacock, of Tom Murphy's Rising play The
Patriot Game, originally commissioned for BBC television but not produced.
It opens on May 14. Dermot Bolder's The Lament For Arthur C1eary, already
seen in the Peacock, is a first grappling with the themes of the new urban
Ireland and the emigrant; but it is hard to see Hedda Gabler (June 25) as
anything but a vehicle for Fiona Shaw. But it would be churlish to criticise
Ms Hynes on such small evidence: we'll have a better idea of her stewardship
this time next year.
In the area of production, however, we shall soon be able to assess her
impact. She is directing The Plough And The Stars, and everyone is looking
for the qualities she has shown in the past: freshness of vision and the
ability to create powerful theatrical images. Her work is marked by a sense
of starting from scratch. Everything she does is a new beginning. And when
you stand in the Abbey foyer, in the somewhat forbidding shadow of the
portraits of the great figures from the past, you realise how important a
new beginning is. Actors have to be persuaded to clear their minds of what
FJ McCormick or Barry Fitzgerald or Cyril Cusack did and read the classical
texts as though they had been written yesterday. The great bureaucratic
establishment of the Abbey has to shake off its inertia.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: Bluff King Hal, sunny side up / Enjoy a quirky view of
Henry VIII
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE church of San Martino which overlooks the bay of Naples, the
sharp-eyed English tourist discovers a disquieting view of our history. A
faded fresco shows Henry VIII watching as a group of Carthusian monks are
hanged, drawn, and quartered. The artist was more accurate than perhaps he
knew. In 1535 Henry did indeed go to Tyburn Hill, with his Court, to watch
the agony of those brave souls who dared to put their duty to God before
their king.
The map of Henry VIII's London had some exceedingly black spots, recently
brought home to me by Susan Brigden's fine and deeply considered book,
London and the Reformation (OUP Pounds 55; 676pp; forthcoming in paperback).
There was Tyburn for traitors, Smithfield for the burning of heretics, and
the Tower of London where so many of Henry's victims were racked and knelt
to the executioner. But a few miles down-river from Traitors Gate, Henry's
palace at Greenwich was a different world. Such is the impression left by
Henry VIII at Greenwich, the provocative new exhibition at the National
Maritime Museum (until 1 September; sponsored by the Sunday Express).
Henry VIII at Greenwich is the star event of the Year of Henry VIII which
commemorates the king's birth 500 years ago in June. However, the trouble
with 'Bluff King Hal' from the marketing point of view is that the moment
you go beyond the level of jokes about Henry's six wives, he becomes a
tricky beast to package, especially abroad. The English Tourist Board must
surely be relieved by the idiosyncratic focus which Dr David Starkey,
distinguished historian of the Henrician court, has given the Greenwich
show.
You will find no reference to dismembered Carthusians, none to the fate of
Thomas More - since 1935, St Thomas More as he is to Catholics. Of course,
the difficulty with history is always knowing what to leave out. Dr
Starkey's presentation is emphatically not the regular view of a reign, nor
of a man. Imagine, for instance, what they would say at school to an essay
on Henry which left out Cardinal Wolsey, Cromwell, the Dissolution of the
Monasteries, and Parliament.
Instead, Starkey gives a subtle presentation of Henry based on his times at
Greenwich. The Maritime Museum is close to the site of the Tudor palace of
Placentia, Henry's birthplace and his principal residence for two decades
after fire destroyed the medieval palace of Westminster in 1512. However,
royal life at Greenwich was largely about rest and recreation, banquets and
hunting. So we find Henry sunny side up.
Nothing today remains of the Tudor palace although the designers have
struggled manfully to evoke its splendours. Dr Starkey has structured his
view of Henry around events more-or-less connected with the palace - the
Field of the Cloth of Gold, when Henry sallied forth to meet Francois I of
France, is a bit of a jump. The French connection is strongly underlined.
There are some splendid manuscripts from France and, for the first time,
bilingual captions in French and English.
Jousts, treaties, a royal christening, the New Year's Day present-giving
ceremony, serve as the basis for 'historical tableaux' which group a very
fine collection of paintings, miniatures, books, manuscripts, armour, and
treasures. The detritus of domestic life is not forgotten either, with
dog-collar and a tennis-ball found lodged in some rafters.
Although I doubt whether the visitor on the hoof is likely to take it in,
these ingenious tableaux lead us on a symbolic journey through the palace
rooms. This conforms to the topographical analysis of power much in vogue
with historians. Such matters become a good deal clearer if you buy the
catalogue, a series of pithy, well-written essays with the title Henry VIII.
A European Court in England.
So we pass, in theory at least, from the Tilt-yard where magnificent armour
evokes the great jousts of 1517, to the Royal Library, the Presence Chamber,
and the Bedchamber. Here Henry's jousts between the sheets with his German
such a flop. The cheery Henrician music stops at this point. Instead, in a
slightly obvious crowd-pleasing strategem, we hear a reading from a memoir
by Sir William Butts, the royal doctor. The king had protested to Butts that
the fault was not his virility - he had experienced two wet dreams, a phrase
left in Latin - but Anne's repulsive body.
A portrait of poor, plain Anne from St John's College, Oxford is one of the
exhibition's unexpected delights. The painting was considered a late copy
until it was cleaned two years ago, and found to be 16th-century. It could
even be one of the portraits produced for Henry's envoys to Cleves when the
king was deliberating which of the two princesses there should be his fourth
wife.
The portraits were rejected on the grounds that German fashion did not
reveal enough of a lady's anatomy. Holbein the Younger, Henry's court
portraitist, was duly sent from London to record the lady although, as
everyone knows, Holbein's genius made too much of the 'Flemish mare's' best
points. Although Holbein's image of Anne was sadly not loaned to Greenwich,
there are 14 of his beautiful drawings of Henry's courtiers from the Queen's
collection.
Nothing can overshadow Holbein's superb painted portrait of Sir Nicholas
Carew in his armour, from the Duke of Buccleuch's collection. Carew, friend
of Henry's gay youth, has a niche in the tableau which evokes the
spectacular reception in 1527 for the ambassadors from Francois I. The
pageantry comes across remarkably well, thanks to the Black Book of the
Order of the Garter and the series of beautifully illuminated peace treaties
which took artists and scribes three days to prepare.
Again, I noticed how a focus on courtly junkettings ironed out the monster's
wrinkles. Eleven years after he sat to Holbein, Carew was sent to the Tower
accused of being a conservative. In prison he read the Bible in English and
realised 'for the first time the sweetness of God's holy word.' Carew went
to the block rejoicing in his conversion to the new faith.
Carew's conscience may pass without comment, but at least the king's does
not. In his famous psalter, he is represented as King David and meditating
in his bedchamber. Less well-known is his boxwood rosary from the Chatsworth
collection, carved for the king by a Flemish craftsman. Each bead of the Ave
has five tiny roundels carved with texts and images of the sybils and
prophets. The last bead, the Pater, is only the size of a golfball but it
opens to show two devotional scenes carved in deep relief, one of the Virgin
in glory.
The Royal Clock Salt is huge and magnificent. Henry's personal suit of
armour is awesome and, as ever, one marvels that the royal warhorse could
even trot under all its gear. Yet of all the objects in this clever,
cock-eyed exhibition, the rosary is surely the most intriguing. Huge old
Henry, 54 inches round the waist, telling his beads in his palace beside the
silver Thames; it may not be the dominant image left by Henry VIII at
Greenwich, but it is there, all the same.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: A service to the community - Radio
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FEW OF the Sony Radio Awards, presented last Monday, went to programmes I
have written about, but this means neither that the judges' tastes are
astray or that I have overlooked masterpieces each week. The Sony prizes
cover a wider field of radio than any single writer could know, and rely on
judges - 38 this year - each expert in his own field, as well as the Society
of Authors, the Radio Academy and Smash Hits. The best education programme
was Women and Aids from Radio Sussex; the best local station of the year was
Radio Borders, from the Borders; the best rock programme was Cousin Matty
from Radio City FM.
The judges will have had tapes of the nominations and need never have
hoisted aerial in Sussex or the Borders. Radio Stoke, whose new serial
(heard on tape) I mentioned last week, won a Sony award with On the Street
for outstanding service to the community. The awards tell usefully of the
varying calibre, and the growing amount, of radio all over the country. One
award few would oppose was Woman's Hour as the best magazine programme -
few, that is, but the Controller of Radio 4, who has been talked out of
changing its name but not out of shifting it to the morning later in the
year.
'Service to the community' can be a broad function. Radio 4's programmes
about bullying at work certainly qualify, but its current series Work Talk
is interesting rather than instructive. Ferdinand Dennis interviews workers
born in the colonies and now living in Britain. His first three have been
Norman Beaton, the actor, Clyde Williams, head of FullEmploy Training, and
Margaret Busby, the publisher. All these are from the West Indies, like
Dennis himself, and all reasonably successful The point made, as I see it,
is that colonials, if that word may be used, show special interest in the
work of other colonials, a prejudice some might call loyal and others
racist.
The Unfair Sex (Radio 4, four consecutive Sundays) is for feminism, for the
unfair sex is, of course, the male. This week we had misogynist quotations
from Fidelis Morgan's The Misogynist's Source-Book. Beginning with the
account of Eve's creation from Genesis, we ran through Roget, Percy's
Reliquiae Antiquae, pop songs, Ovid, Beerbohm, Dali, Ecclesiastes and
Proverbs, to end with Boucicault's remark summing the theme up neatly, 'I
wish Adam had died with all his ribs in his body.' Entertainment more than
service, but good listening, agree with it or not.
Later the same evening The Deserted Child showed how misogyny might be
prompted. Queen Victoria's treatment of her third son, Prince Arthur, was
unspeakable. Her own childhood was bound to have given her some unusual
notions. Perhaps she wanted to make sure that Prince Arthur was not like the
Prince of Wales. After the death of Prince Albert ('father, protector,
guide') the Queen appointed Major Howard Elphinstone as the Prince's
'governor', and he remained in that post even after the Prince had been to
Woolwich and granted an Army commissioned.
But the Queen wrote endless personal notes. Be reserved in Society, but
affectionate with servants. Never speak harshly to Highlanders. Do not copy
Bertie's way of sitting with arms on the table. Do not read too much
scripture on Sundays. Polo is 'really cruel', hunting overdone. The
unfortunate Elphinstone was ultimately promoted lieutenant-colonel and
knighted. The Prince became a field-marshal and Duke of Connaught, and
married a German princess. The Queen's expertise at arranging marriages will
be dealt with in next week's programme. We may also learn the point of the
title.
A word on Radio 3's Two's Company on Fridays. Charles Melville considers
jazz players who liked playing together, and could hardly begin with anyone
but Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang (Wildcat, he gave us). But some of the other
duos - Armstrong and Hines, for instance - seem to me no more than happy
studio meetings. In that category, we might extend to such joys as Tram, Bix
and Eddie.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: Siren song and lost treasure - The Proms, museums and
the treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN DRUMMOND, controller of BBC Radio 3, could sell music to the Sirens and
his launch of the Proms programme is always a tour de force. You had somehow
forgotten your longing to hear the USSR Ministry of Culture Chamber Choir
sing Rakhmaninov's Vespers in Russian until Drummond tells you he has
dreamed of the moment since childhood.
As the man with the biggest budget - Pounds 40m - in British music, Drummond
can bag the names, and this year's Proms offering of 67 concerts in 58 days
has the usual plums - the first Prom visit by the Berlin Philharmonic, the
European premier of Tippett's Byzantium, the English revival after 65 years
of Dvorak's The Spectre's Bride. There are also curiosities, notably 89 year
harpist Sidonie Goossens, the only survivor of Adrian Boult's original BBC
Symphony Orchestra of 1930, playing 'The Last Rose of Summer' on the Last
Night.
For a Pounds 95 season ticket you can hear everything as a Promenader. Over
half the 200 works on offer will have been composed this century and there
are five new commissions. There should have been six but once again Malcolm
Williamson, Master of the Queen's Music, has failed to deliver. This time he
has actually written the piece, but he now sees it as part of a larger work
and neither composer, soloist James Galway, nor Drummond think it should be
performed out of context.
The Gulf War was not an unqualified success - it messed up the
Acceptance-in-Lieu scheme under which tax can be paid in works of art rather
than hard cash. The Treasury has always hated the idea: it raises the
spectre of the American practice where the rich can pay off their tax bills
by giving pictures, etc, to museums (sometimes at fanciful valuations), and
the Revenue has managed to keep the money it 'lost' to AIL to a theoretical
Pounds 12m a year.
But in the financial year just ended only Pounds 1.25m was written off
against tax compared with Pounds 11.5m in 1989-90. The Treasury's excuse is
that the exceptional and unknown costs of the Gulf War forced it to freeze
all special provisions, including Acceptance-in-Lieu. So the major deal
planned last December, a Sevres service and an 18th century French wardrobe
sold to pay off another Pounds 2m of the tax due on the Pounds 90m estate of
the late Dolly Rothschild, was suspended until April and will be in the
1991-92 figures.
It is surprising that more use is not made of AIL, especially now that
prices for British works of art have collapsed at auction. During the 1980s
it was easy for Sotheby's and Christie's to convince executors and heirs
that rich foreigners would pay a higher price in the saleroom than the
Treasury, or any British museum, could muster through AIL or private treaty
sale.
Even when it turned out that the Chester Beatty estate got a smaller return,
after tax, by selling Van Gogh's 'Sunflowers' for Pounds 24.2m at Christie's
than it would have received from a museum deal at less than half that price;
even when major pictures last year, like Constable's 'The Lock' or Benjamin
West's 'General Monckton', either failed to meet their estimate at auction
or to find a buyer at all, the excitement of a public sale seemed to
mesmerise vendors.
Apart from auction room hype the other main reason why the AIL provisions
are not more widely used is that with a top tax rate of just 40 per cent and
schemes to protect inheritances from the Inland Revenue, the very rich are
so much richer these days. There is less need for them to sell.
But greed will sometimes out and the queue of national treasures waiting in
the warehouse for export shows no signs of lessening. The campaign by the
Fitzwilliam at Cambridge to keep the Badminton cabinet seems a sadly lost
cause. But Nick Serota at the Tate might still find a rich friend to cough
up the Pounds 10m needed to save 'The Lock', to grace his forthcoming
Constable show, and if York launches an appeal to raise Pounds 2m to retain
the Middleham Jewel the National Heritage Fund will rally round with some
cash.
'The Three Graces' is in total limbo. The export stop still holds but the
owner, widely believed to be a Trust controlled by the Tavistock family, is
insisting, without success, that the putative buyers, the Barclay twins, pay
the interest it has lost on the Pounds 8m sculpture while the attempts to
save it have meandered on.
With museum purchasing grants frozen for the last six years the NHF, with
its annual grant of Pounds 12m, has become the last chance for diverting
works of art away from the docks and into the safety of national
institutions. But as Neil MacGregor, director of the National Gallery,
pointed out this week, the reliance on the NHF is starting to create a one
sided view of art.
The Fund, quite rightly, only aims to safeguard British treasures, or
foreign masterpieces which have traditionally been admired by British
collectors. If extra purchasing money was given directly to museums and
galleries the National Gallery and the Tate would be spending it on
acquiring foreign works, like 19th century Italian and German art, and 20th
century Russian. By channelling all the safeguarding money into a heritage
fund a traditionalist and insular tradition is maintained and the wider
currents of world art lost to sight.
A couple of Thatcherite councillors in Ealing are going to wreck the
cultural heritage of the capital. That is the not totally fanciful story
being pedalled by the administrators of a hundred London arts organisations
who see the Pounds 3m a year they get from the London Boroughs Grants Scheme
reduced to, at the best, Pounds 2m, at the worst nothing, because of the
spoiling tactics of the Tories.
The sums may be tiny, less than Pounds 5,000 in some cases, but the failure
of the 1991-92 cheques to arrive has already forced over 50 job losses. Even
the bigger organisations are affected. The King's Head has cancelled all
in-house productions and the Bush is cutting 40 per cent of its planned
productions. Hampstead will go dark for two months in 1992. Eight
organisations, mainly ethnic dance and theatre companies, face immediate
closure.
The best move for the arts companies is not to pretend that London will come
to a halt without them but to make the financial case for survival. This is
the approach of the King's Head which points out that 41 per cent of the
shows in the West End, a magnet for the Pounds 2b spent annually on arts
related tourism in the UK, originated from the subsidised sector, and that
the Government received ten times as much from VAT on King's Head
productions, and transfers, than it indirectly gives in its LBGS grant of
Pounds 34,000.

FT  04 MAY 91 / As they say in Europe: A curious insularity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE PRESIDENT took us out on the terrace overlooking the south lawn and
told us that we really had to promote growth in our own economies.' In
Washington last Sunday this story was told by the Italian finance minister
to the correspondent of Il Sole 14 Ore, among others. But Guido Carli is 75
and the incident he related took place in 1962 - the President was John F.
Kennedy.
The same thing happened when the Group of Seven finance ministers met in
Washington last Sunday; this time it was President Bush who told the
assembled ministers and central bank governors that they ought to be cutting
interest rates - to promote economic recovery.
So for Guido Carli little had changed. He takes a long view because he is
the one man still around at this level who was actually at Bretton Woods in
1945 for the famous conference that established the post-war international
monetary system. Others, however, go back little further than the Gulf War.
It was Klaus Engelen in Handelsblatt of Frankfurt who observed: 'America
can't lead everything,' adding 'after the Gulf War, the interest rate war.
The question is now whether we go back to the experience of the crash of
1987.'
That was when interest rates got out of line and there was a crisis of
confidence in international co-operation. So, asked Dr Engelen, did Nicholas
Brady, US Treasury Secretary, want to get another bloody nose from the
Bundesbank?
'The whole interest rate campaign came after Washington realised that the
Gulf War would not lift business activity . . . But a sober expression of
this meeting is that leadership in war doesn't mean that on the battle
fields of interest rates and inflation, America can lead the world as well.'
Fortunately, Germany had found a sound ally in fighting against American
monetary excesses. Norman Lamont, UK Chancellor, had come to the support of
'the embattled finance minister, Theo Waigel', Engelen said
So Lamont is the second in the line of British ministers who have become
minor stars in the German firmament - Chris Patten on the liberal left,
Norman Lamont among the Bavarian conservatives. But Waigel relies heavily on
the votes of highly of subsidised farmers for his political strength. Lamont
spent a long time at the various IMF finance ministers' meetings lecturing
his audience on the iniquities of the Community's Common Agricultural
Policy.
It may have been the support of Britain that led Roel Janssen in
NRC-Handelsblad of Rotterdam to remark: 'The Germans stole the show - they
got out of it morally strengthened.'
For the French there was more than just a Euro-American row at stake. There
was also clear evidence that France was caught out because it had very
little to say on the row in question. And it could hardly in its present
circumstances side with the Germanic and Tory puritans. Nor could it support
the the US against its partners. So the only solution was to make it clear
that everybody else was making a bit of a mess of things.
Le Quotidien de Paris headlined its story: 'Germany Imposes Unemployment.'
In La Tribune, Isabelle Croizard and Dominique Thiebaut asked whether in
view of the discord, the Group of Seven had not become the Group of Nought.
The outcome of all the arguing about interest rates was that the Federal
Reserve cut its discount rate by half a percentage point. The IMF's powerful
Interim Committee had just stated that nobody should do that unless
inflation and budget deficits were under control, which they are not in the
US. But there was no word of criticism from anyone. They were all too glad
to see the dollar fall.
The meetings at the IMF which normally take place here twice a year reflect
a curious fact about the US. I have quoted only a tiny part of the wealth of
comment that appeared in the European press about the doings of the finance
ministers.
In the American press, there is little or nothing. The Washington Post has a
bit about all these things, and the New York Times devotes some of its
business section to these matters. But in, say, the Baltimore Sun, published
a mere 45 miles away, there is less about vital matters of international
finance than in the provincial Swiss press, and it is harder to get more
provincial than that.
So I have a proposal. Largely for the sake of the thousands of foreign
reporters who flock here at such times, Washington should be moved east. Not
physically, but by time zone. Harrassed Europeans anxiously watch deadlines
pass as they miss their last editions at home because the news arrives too
late in Washington. Bored Americans take no notice when the news does
arrive.
The peculiar thing is that in Europe the local news is enhanced if lots of
foreign dignitaries are present. In the US any foreign presence reduces the
importance of the story. Thus the only speeches Ronald Reagan made that did
not appear live on that ultimate arbiter of news, CNN, were those before the
annual World Bank-IMF meeting here.
Yet there is perhaps another side to this insularity. Let me start by saying
I have not looked at comparative coverage of the disasters that have
afflicted the Kurds, largely because the views on their peculiar tragedy
have been unusually uniform. Everybody has said more or less the same thing.
But I saw that the widely syndicated American columnist, Leslie H. Gelb, was
able to seize on this uniform and wide coverage to make a uniquely American
domestic political point.
'Our movers and shakers - in the Federal Government and the media - know and
care more about foreign than domestic affairs.' He added: 'America's elites
can rattle off the names of the top three Kurdish leaders and skip into
intricate arguments about what can be done to re-establish Iraq as the
garden of Eden. But ask them about what's involved in Medicaid or Federal
aid to education, and most will return a guilty smile - and guide the
conversation back to Gorbachev or the Kurds.'

FT  04 MAY 91 / Sport: The heroes and villains are back - America's cup
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TODAY, after more than four years in limbo
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or possibly a kind of yachting purgatory - the America's Cup starts a new
life. The Blue Peter is now flying for first-ever regatta in the new 80-foot
Cup class in San Diego, California - an world championship that is the
preamble to the main contest, which begins there next January.
All the heroes and villains are back in town - plus a few new ones. Damon
Runyon would have loved the America's Cup. Smooth Kiwi financier Michael Fay
has entered one of his three yachts while another is on charter to the
somewhat disorganised Spanish team.
Dennis Conner is a San Diegan and will sail his new boat, Stars &amp; Stripes,
for the first time. Already a few visitors are learning that you do not play
poker with The Man in his own kitchen.
Much attention will focus on the Italian team led and bankrolled by
industrialist Raul Gardini. Gardini has entered two boats in the regatta and
has told his skipper, Paul Cayard, an American who found it worthwhile to
live in Europe, that with Dollars 40m available to the programme, some
silverware on the table would be appreciated.
However, around the sailors' bars the word is that the Italians are going
backwards. The more money they spend on design and personnel, the slower the
boats get. This is a well-recognised Cup phenomenon which in 1986 stopped
the extraordinarily well-funded New York Yacht Club equipe from even making
the challenger semi-finals.
No team will be subjected to such close domestic scrutiny as the Japanese
two-boat effort. The America's Cup has become a virtual crusade in the
Ginza, inspiring everything from leisure clothes to nightclubs. Chris
Dickson, the Kiwi skipper in 1986-87, has been paid a reputed Dollars
900,000 to drive the Japanese No 1 yacht and has even learned Japanese.
Intent on a place on a more than merely financial world stage, Japan seems
set on irritating the Americans, current and near-perpetual holders of the
Auld Mug. 'We have Columbia Pictures. We have Rockefeller Centre . . . Why
not the America's Cup?' asked Kaoru Ogimi, commodore of the Nippon Ocean
Racing Club, on a recent visit to the US.
The American most determined to frustrate Ogimi's daydreams is alternative
energy billionaire Bill Koch, who came into big-boat racing in 1984 with the
purchase of the maxi-yacht Matador. Since then nothing Koch has done has
been less than precisely calculated. When he built a new maxi, Matador 2,
five years of research from 20 naval architects went into the hull design.
Third-scale models - bigger than most family yachts - were sailed off Koch's
compound at Cape Cod. At her first regatta Matador 2 won five out of seven
races without really trying. The technical director for the Cup yacht is Dr
Heiner Meldner, a nuclear physicist. Last week Koch announced that Boeing
would be supporting his technical effort.
'We plan to make every bit of technology we can find in America to make our
boat go fast,' he told the media. A bit of disinformation does not go amiss,
either. The public were told that the first yacht was under construction at
a locked shed at the Goetz yard in Rhode Island. Goetz was, in fact, paid to
keep the shed empty and secret. The real yacht was built at an aerospace
facility in the Utah desert.
A scan through the entry list reveals that nine boats from the US, France,
Italy, Japan, Spain and New Zealand are due to line up for the regatta. The
Cup has become a tussle between the dollar, the yen and (in the absence of a
European currency) the deutschmark.
But what of Britain? Peter de Savary will have his design team of Ian
Howlett and Phil Morrison in San Diego evaluating the opposition prior to
the beginning of construction of a British contender in June.
'It's hard to see a lot of strength in the fleet as it stands,' said
Howlett, who designed America's Cup challengers for Britain in 1980, 1983
and 1986. 'There are going to be some very embarrassed people out there who
have spent a lot of money. There's no doubt in my mind that we can produce
boats that are significantly faster than anything out there at the moment.'
With skipper Lawrie Smith already signed up to drive the boat and a
construction team on stand-by, the de Savary team looks in reasonable shape,
but must still be rated an outside chance.
At the end of the current regatta, however, many of the major-league players
who have already built one or two boats may be wishing they had kept their
money in the bank and done a little more watching and thinking.
'A shortage of money and time can concentrate the mind wonderfully,' says
Howlett pithily.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Motoring: Determined to be a ruler of the road
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHT YEARS ago, Mitsubishi's Shogun was the first import to loosen Range
Rover's stranglehold on the posh end of the four-wheel drive, on-off road
market.
Range Rover, aristocratic elder statesman of recreational 4x4s, is now in
its 21st year. It looks much the same as it did when launched in 1970,
although there have been many changes below stairs.
That is not the Japanese way of making motor cars. At five years, a Japanese
car is getting long in the tooth and at eight, it is overdue for
replacement. So this week, a completely new Shogun went on sale in Britain,
some months after it had made its debut back home.
Or rather, two Shogun estates; a short wheelbase 3-door and long wheelbase
5-door. Each comes with a choice of a 3-litre V6 petrol engine with
catalyser or a 2.5 litre turbocharged and intercooled diesel. A 5-speed
manual gearbox is standard, a 4-speed automatic optional on the petrol V6
versions.
Only the engines, suitably uprated, have been carried over. Everything else,
from the curvy styling to a unique transmission offering the benefits of
both two-wheel and four-wheel drive, is new. Having tried all of them on and
off road, I rate the new Shoguns clear class leaders for all-round
performance, comfort and value for money.
Prices, which include a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty, start at
Pounds 17,989 for the 3-door diesel and go up to Pounds 22,349 for an
automatic 5-door V6. The diesels are cheaper than their petrol- engined
equivalents.
If I have any reservation about the Shoguns at all, it is their styling. The
original one had fairly sober, straight up and down lines that quickly gave
it a Range Rover acceptability in the country, both as a puller of horse
trailers and a grandstand at hunt races.
The new one is a bit bulgy in a transatlantic kind of way. Not as de trop as
the vast new Toyota Land-Cruiser, you understand, but perhaps not quite as
Badminton as it used to be.
Potential owners of on-off road four-wheel drives (especially those to be
used mostly on-road) should look beyond the rotund styling and flash alloy
wheels. They will find the Shogun as light to drive, as refined mechanically
and almost as comfortable to ride in as a car. Yet off road, it makes light
of terrain not one owner in 100 would dream of driving over.
The secret of the Shogun's elegance on-road is its independent front
suspension. All its class rivals, bar the Isuzu Trooper, have beam axles
front and back. These are fine - arguably better - for the most severe
off-road driving but they can't provide really car-like handling on road.
Immediately after testing the Shogun I drove its closest competitor, the
Land Rover Discovery. This admirable machine is relaxed on a motorway and
almost unstoppable across y ride on winding roads disconcerting. It is less
urbane (the turbo-diesel in particular) than the Shogun when used as a car
substitute.
Shoguns used to have a simple, selectable transmission. For normal roads,
they were rear-wheel driven; for driving across country, on snow-covered
roads or muddy tracks, you put them in high or low range four-wheel drive.
They can still be used in rear wheel-only drive on the road. This makes them
quieter and more economical because it puts out of use two sets of gears,
one in the transfer box, the other in the front axle. But four-wheel drive
can also be engaged or disengaged at up to 100 kmh (62 mph) and, if you
wish, left permanently in use, as it is in a Range Rover, Land Rover
Discovery or the latest Mercedes Benz G-Wagen.
The new Shogun has a central viscous coupling. This allows four-wheel drive
to be used full time on hard, dry roads without straining the transmission,
making the steering feel peculiar or wearing out the tyres. It can be locked
for extra off-road traction.
All these functions are under the control of a single, easy-to-use lever
that also selects high and low range in the transfer gearbox. For the
ultimate in off-road grip, pressing a button on the fascia locks the rear
differential, providing your speed is less than 10kph (7mph).
I drove the Shoguns in Spain, where a dry spell ended the day I arrived  -
it always does. On traditionally awful Spanish minor roads through the
mountains - even the patches are patched - they went exactly where I pointed
them in comfort and security. On the autovia, they cruised quietly at the
sort of speeds British business drivers are accustomed to use on motorways.
The impression I had - may Mitsubishi forgive me - was of driving an
abnormally high-slung Volvo estate car. The engines are quiet, the
transmission literally noiseless and wind noise subdued.
Shoguns are equipped and have interiors furnished to executive car levels.
The long wheelbase ones have a large power-operated glass sunroof over the
passenger part. Even the 3-door models - now genuine 5-seaters - have
electric windows, headlamp washers and rear window wash-wipe. The back door
is side-hinged and stays open when the Shogun is parked on a steep slope.
Among the instruments is an exterior thermometer and an inclinometer.
All big, bluff four-wheel drives become thirsty when driven fast because the
air cannot flow smoothly around their bodies.
Still, the new Shoguns are not so bad as the originals, with drag
coefficients (an indication of their wind resistance) of 0.48 compared with
0.55. Cars that cruise quite economically at 80mph (128kph) have drag
coefficients of around 0.30.
The official figures suggest the Shogun turbo-diesels should average about
25mpg (11.3l/100km) and the petrol V6s, whether manual or automatic, around
20mpg (13.5l/100km) when used on roads in rear-wheel drive. But if you
cruise at more than 80mph (128kph) and drive them as though they were hot
hatchbacks, all bets are off.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Sport: Northampton's mighty oak - Rugby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Hopkins, the noted British sportswriter, will report regularly for the
Weekend FT on golf and rugby, joining a small band of regular commentators:
John Barrett (tennis), Teresa McLean (cricket), Keith Wheatley (yachting and
sports politics), and Michael Thompson-Noel (horse racing).
IT IS A matter of opinion whether or not Northampton is 'a dull place with
much nondescript modern development,' as it is described in the Blue Guide
to England. But suggest that its rugby team and its captain are dull or
nondescript and you will have to answer to some of the most partisan
spectators this side of Cornwall. This afternoon, coachloads of these
supporters will be at Twickenham to roar on - and I mean roar on -
Northampton in the Pilkington Cup final against Harlequins.
When the men in black, green and gold run on to the most famous rugby pitch
in the world, take a look at Gary Pearce, Northampton's captain. You can
hardly miss him. His neck is as wide as most people's thighs and his thighs
are as sturdy as the trunk of a tree. Wound around his head as protection
for his ears will be a yard and a half of sticky tape.
Pearce, who is 35, will probably be straining slightly as he leads his men
out, puffing his cheeks, pointing his toes, his large hands making the ball
look insignificant. He labours away at the game's pit face, the front row of
the scrum, where it can be dark and gloomy. As tight-head prop he is the
cornerstone of Northampton's scrum and as captain he is cornerstone of the
team.
He is the one who is never late on the team bus, never misses training,
always gets on with the job in hand and the man always proffered as an
example for younger players to model themselves on.
Pearce first played for Northampton three prime ministers, three general
elections and more than 13 years ago. He arrived from Aylesbury one Easter
and less than a year later was playing for England. Since then he has
acquired 34 more caps, the most by a prop forward, and has been on eight
tours for his country.
When you try to assess Pearce's assets as a rugby player you think of his
strength, which is considerable, and of how good he is at doing what you
might call the basic chores of his job. You won't see him frolicking in open
play; his 16 3/4 stone sees to that. But his scrummaging technique is so
faultless it could come straight from the pages of a rugby manual.
'Gary has very strong legs and always keeps his back straight,' says Barry
Corless, Northampton's coaching coordinator. 'From this position he can
drive forwards and upwards the moment the ball comes in. That is why he is
so good. You see so many props with their heads down near their knees in a
scrum and their backs rounded.'
Northampton and their homely ground at Franklin's Gardens have been
transformed since the summer's day three years ago when a cabal of seven
members obtained the necessary majority at an annual general meeting to oust
the existing committee and take over the club. Not everyone liked what
followed. Soon the tumbrils rattled. Pockets of discontent formed and
remain.
But even those old members who have boycotted the club since the revolution
could not deny the transformation effected by the new management. Three
years ago the club was struggling near the foot of the second division. This
season it finished eighth equal in the first.
Last season Northampton won the national sevens and reached the semi-finals
of the cup, thus drawing in more spectators. This has had such an effect
that membership has trebled - one afternoon last season as much money was
taken from one game as in the whole of the previous season. Northampton have
set a record for ticket sales for this afternoon's final - more than Pounds
130,000.
The Saints go marching in all right, taking coachloads of supporters
wherever they go. Every rugby club in the county will have at least one
coach full of supporters at Twickenham this afternoon, which is more than
can be said of Harlequins. The size of Northampton's invading force will be
considerable, even if it is smaller than Cornwall's army was in the final of
the divisional championship recently.
Last Saturday Northampton travelled to south-west London to play Rosslyn
Park in what was the last league game of the season for both clubs.
Roehampton looked at its best and spectators stood around, drinks in hand,
enjoying the warmth of a spring afternoon. The result was a foregone
conclusion from the moment Park scored in the second minute. The final score
was 48-0.
It seemed a shocking result for Northampton, who were only three players
below full strength, and to get some perspective on it I sought the views of
two of the most distinguished members of the home club.
Phil Keith-Roach, Rosslyn Park's former hooker and now coach, is as much a
part of the club as the netting that stops the ball flying out of the ground
and on to the Upper Richmond Road.
'Gary Pearce is so good technically there's no reason why he shouldn't go on
until he's 40, provided he stays free of injuries,' said the indomitable
Keith-Roach. 'I played against him in my last game for Park. I broke my neck
and thought I'd better retire. Mind, I was 42 at the time.'
Then I came across the massive figure of the club's president and former
England international, Andy Ripley, who beamed down benignly from behind his
John Lennon spectacles. I thought I would soften him up with an easy
question first.
'How are you?' I asked.
'Dancing on the end of a sunbeam, thank you very much,' he replied.
'And what did you make of that performance?
'Northampton are an unusual side,' he replied. 'They haven't got many stars
and they were obviously not very interested this afternoon. Next weekend one
of two things could happen. They could raise their game and win. Or they
could be overwhelmed and lose by a record margin. I'm not quite sure which.'

<TEXT>
FIRST-TIME visitors to Orso's, that favourite watering-hole of the media in
London's Covent Garden, never fail to be charmed by the sunny Italian
pottery on which the food is served. The cheerful colours and light-hearted
motifs are a splendid complement to the gutsy Italian-style mood of the
cooking and many diners have ended up wanting to buy the plates it all came
on as well. Now they can.
Tricia Guild, who is married to Richard Polo, the owner of Orso, has now
produced a new range of designs for the same robust pottery. It all comes
from southern Italy but the colours of the new collection are softer,
prettier, less bright. The motifs are as charming as ever, ranging from
cockerels and fish to fruits and vegetables.
Do not try to buy a matching set - the whole point is to have a random
collection which you mix and match as the mood takes you. Available at
Designers Guild, 271 King's Road, London SW3. Prices range from Pounds 6 to
Pounds 27.
Transporting the essential chilled white wine from kitchen to pool could not
be easier than with this wire basket - Pounds 10 from Habitat.
Also at Habitat is a range of folding wooden chairs painted in soft washed
colours, the sort that would mix in beautifully with Tricia Guild's pottery.
Pounds 14.75 each.
Foot-high sturdy hurricane lamp - use traditional church candles but if you
want the midges kept at bay make sure you buy an insect repellent candle.
Pounds 42.30 from The Conran Shop, Michelin House, 81 Fulham Road, London

FT  04 MAY 91 / How To Spend It: An Eden for the avant gardener - Today's
contrary garden is more than silver bells and cockle shells
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THOSE who think that gardeners are prone to wallowing in nostalgia for
the herbaceous borders of the past, The Oxford Gallery's occasional forays
into the world of garden design are a useful corrective. Here is where the
avant-garde of the green welly set make their stand. No romantic-style
garlanded urns, no cute gnomes, no 'authentic' copies of Byronic statues,
but distinctive, innovative ideas from our most contemporary of crafts
people.
The Oxford Gallery always has some work by contemporary artists for the
garden but from time to time it mounts a large exhibition on the theme.
Usually the exhibitions have been held at High Walls near Oxford - this time
they are bringing their wares to London, to the Barbican Centre, where the
sculpture court and a fine conservatory offer a surprisingly horticultural
setting for such an urban address. If your idea of decorating your patio is
to distribute a few terracotta pots tastefully around the place, then this
is an exhibition to make you think. Sally Tarshish of Inscape Gardens sets
the mood with some immensely erudite ideas on gardening gleaned from
Chinese, medieval and classic Greek texts which she translates into a plant
and sculpture garden, Five Walks. A hornbeam grove and a burbling fountain
by William Pye lies in the heart of it.
The work of the 50 artists and sculptors on show will ensure you never look
at gardens in quite the same way again. There are Monica Young's giant-sized
pots - a bit out of scale for the average city patio but splendid in a large
country garden; there are ceramic kits from Jitka Palmer; stone gargoyles
from Alec and Fiona Peever; or what about a carved wooden crocodile by Nick
Deans? Materials used range from stone and wood to ceramic and industrial
salvage.
Prices for some of the special pieces seem high but many of them really are
works of art. There will be many smaller, more affordable things as well -
willow baskets by Alison Fitzgerald starting at Pounds 30, ceramic tableware
ranging from Pounds 15, and lots more. This exhibition is far removed from
the average garden centre display. Part sculpture, part decorative, part
practical, anybody interested in pushing forward the art of creating gardens
should not miss it.
The Avant Garden exhibition opens at the Barbican Centre, Sculpture Court,
Silk Street, London EC2 on May 16 and runs until June 16. It will open
Mondays to Saturdays from 11am to 6pm and on Sundays from noon to 6pm.
Admission to the sculpture court is free but there is a 75p charge for
adults, and 50p for children, to see the conservatory. All the pieces will
be for sale and similar items can be ordered from the artists.
If your garden could really do with a gazebo, then Amdega have come up with
the answer. A gazebo, according to the dictionary, is 'a structure whence a
view may be had', and Amdega's gazebo is worthy of the finest view.
Hexagonally shaped, made from Western Red Cedar wood and supported by arches
and decorative trellis, it is really a summer house with open sides through
which you can admire said view. Around the trellis you can trail whatever
you deem to be this year's fashionable climber. The standard design is big
enough to take a table and chairs so that you can have tea and cucumber
sandwiches in time-honoured style, or perhaps a sundowner, while you admire
the view. It has a proper roof of cedar shingle which should protect from
mild showers. At Pounds 2,120 (plus Vat) it had better be some view. Amdega
is one of the oldest names in conservatories and you can order one of its
free colour brochures by ringing 0800-59123.
If your idea of summer is some nicely turned steaks or burgers out on the
barbecue, you could look at the range of barbecues produced by Barbecue
Cuisine. I prefer the old-fashioned home-built brick versions but they do
lack culinary flexibility. Barbecue Cuisine has more high-tech barbecue
accessories, including the Auto-kebab, a battery-operated device that gently
rotates the kebabs over the gas or charcoal barbecue. The unit is 11ins by
16ins, costs Pounds 34.99 and can be fitted to most barbecues. It comes with
six stainless steel 18ins skewers, battery-operated motor and recipe
leaflet. Available at most garden centres.
Finally, the nicest parasols I have come across - and even in this country
eating out of the doors in the summer requires some kind of protection from
the sun if the mayonnaise is not to curdle and the butter to melt - are
Rusco's Palladio parasols. They have a simplicity of design and a grandeur
of size that makes them entirely different from those flimsy, dinky
brightly-coloured numbers that litter most Mediterranean beaches. They are
made from double twill canvas treated against mould and damp so that they
can be left outside during the summer months and though I prefer the natural
colouring they also come in duck-egg blue, denim blue, burnt sienna, yellow,
green, brown, red and old rose. There are several sizes: the smallest, at
Pounds 175, is 2.5 metres across; while the largest is 5 metres across and
costs Pounds 600. The bases, made from seasoned hard wood, range from Pounds
29 to Pounds 98. The umbrellas are all joisted up (easily, so they tell me)
by a pull-up rope. They can be seen at Harrods, Heal's and The Conran Shop
in London, but you can order a leaflet or the parasol itself by mail from
Rusco Marketing, Little Faringdon Mill, Lechlade, Gloucestershire GL7 3QQ.
Those with old curtains they wish to sell through The Curtain Exchange
shops, mentioned last week, might like to note that they will get 60 per
cent of the sale price and the shop keeps 40 per cent.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Cookery: The first whiff of summer salad days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST glimmers of summer produce have already appeared in the shops, but
I rate these imports as pale (and expensive) imitators of the real thing. So
I am happy to wait a few weeks until our own aspagarus and strawberry
seasons get into full swing.
Do not mistake this for an outburst of nationalistic fervour. It is a matter
of the taste. Flavour and freshness are what count if you want to eat well,
not show-off size and early arrival on the scene.
Modest little heart-shaped scarlet strawberries grown in English fields are
much more desirable than vulgar gobstopper giants from California - and tiny
fragile fraises du bois grown at the feet of other plants in your own garden
are the sweetest and most fragrant of all.
The sappy deliciousness of asparagus is remarkably fleeting. When the stalks
are truly fresh they release a lilylike scent as you scrape them for
cooking. Delays render them dull and lacklustre. This is no veg to subject
to jet-lag.
The first of May and the start of the bank holiday season herald the
awakening of summer. The urge to get out and about begins to stir in us all.
Picnic hampers are brought out of hiding. Expeditions are planned. Cooks
vote for shorter kitchen hours, and dishes that are quick and easy to
prepare appeal more than ever.
Salads would seem an obvious solution but it is too soon, too cool yet for
appetites to fade and feel faint with heat. A flimsy little something light
and leafy is not enough. What this hungry early summer season calls for is
salads full of gutsy flavours, generously laced with ingredients you can
really get your teeth into.
Here are two suggestions. Both will make a substantial main course for lunch
(the second is also suitable for carrying on picnics) and both can be served
as a first course for a dinner party if you prefer.
I am reluctant to tell you that the first one is a salad set in jelly lest
you think in terms of one of those dreadful nouvelle cuisine vegetable
dishes - mostly jelly, usually insipid, with the occasional art-directed
bean and baby carrot, usually semi-raw, embedded in it. Such 'hunt the
vegetable' dishes may have been thought up to satisfy the aesthete's eye but
they do little for healthy appetites.
This is a very different affair, essentially a sort of Salade Nicoise
presented in an alternative guise, the ingredients simply packed into a
mould and held together by pouring a little savoury jelly around them. No
designer skills, no effort required - the results look impressive because
the ingredients are handsome. For a final flamboyant fling, the salad can be
garnished after unmoulding if you like with a blaze of brilliant colour and
flavour in the form of peppery nasturtium leaves and a few of their rich red
and tawny gold flowers.
The second salad is one I was treated to by a great friend at a recent lunch
party. Salads of spinach, bacon and quails' eggs are known and loved, as are
those of duck or chicken livers with frizzy endive. She took the idea a
clever step further to produce a salad chocabloc with goodies, more solids
than leaves, a wonderfully felicitous melange of flavours and textures and a
rich mosaic of colours.
As she says, part of the charm of the dish lies in the fact that it need
never be quite the same twice. There is no absolute ingredients list, no
fixed weights and measures to follow. The idea is to use whatever is
currently freshest and best in the market place and to your particular
liking.
The ingredients and quantities listed below record my choice when making the
salad last weekend. They give you the spirit of the thing - an approximate
ratio of leaves to meats and other goodies and the sort of dressing to
consider using - to serve as a springboard for your own variations on the
theme.
TUNA SALAD EN TERRINE (serves 6 for lunch, more as a first course)
1 x 7 oz can of tuna fish, drained and broken into chunks; 1 x 2 oz can of
anchovy fillets, drained and rolled up into spirals; 10 oz French beans,
topped, tailed and steamed; 2 hard-boiled eggs, each cut into 6 wedges; 1
red pepper, grilled, skinned and cut into strips; 4 oz small cherry
tomatoes; 2 heaped tablespoons capers; 14 black olives, stoned; 2 oranges;
the leaves of a small bunch of basil, torn in half if large; 2 packets of
aspic.
Grate the zest of one orange, put it into a measuring jug with the aspic
powder and pour on 1 pt boiling water. Stir to dissolve and leave to cool
slightly. Squeeze the juice from both oranges. Stir this into the liquid
aspic and top up with cold water to make a scant 1 3/4 pt liquid in total.
Arrange some of the ingredients over the base of a 3-3 1/2 pt ring mould,
bread tin or terrine, enough to quarter-fill the mould. Pour on just enough
cooled aspic to 'bind' the solids and bed them down. Refrigerate for a few
minutes until semi-set.
Pack more ingredients into the mould, enough to half-fill it at least, cover
with aspic and refrigerate as before. Repeat a third and maybe a fourth time
until all the solid ingredients are used up and the mould is full.
I make no attempt to arrange the ingredients in a formal pattern with layers
of this, a criss cross of beans or whatever. The colours, shapes and
textures of the foods are appetising enough to look lovely however
haphazardly you pack them in. The only conscious effort I make is to
juxtapose the blander ingredients, like eggs and beans, with the more
piquant ones so that when unmoulded for serving every slice will include its
fair share of savoury bite.
Cover the filled mould and chill until the aspic has set to a firm jelly.
Remove from the fridge half an hour or so before serving. Loosen the salad
by dipping the base of the tin briefly in warm water. Dry it, run a knife
around the inside edge of the tin to release the salad and unmould it onto a
serving plate.
A bowl of garlicky mayonnaise goes well with this. For lunch I sometimes
partner the dish with a potato salad scattered with plenty of spring onions,
rocket, slivers of fennel and nasturtium or marigold petals.
SERIOUSLY RICH SALAD (serves 6 for lunch, more as a first course)  1/2 lb
streaky bacon rashers;  1/2 lb chicken livers; 1 dozen quails' eggs; 1
avocado pear; 1 red pepper; 1 small bulb of Florentine fennel; 4 oranges; 1
1/2 dozen cherry tomatoes; 1 1/2 dozen radishes; 1 bunch of spring onions; a
handful of raisins; 2 heaped tablespoons each toasted sunflower and pumpkin
seeds; 1 bunch watercress; 2 handfuls frizzy endive.
Grill the bacon until very crisp and cut into snippets. Clean the chicken
livers, cut into smallish pieces and saute until brown on the outside but
still tender and pink within. Hard-boil the eggs and shell them; leave whole
or cut in half. Dice the flesh of the avocado, pepper and fennel. Remove all
peel and pith from the oranges and cut the flesh into segments. Slice the
radishes thinly. Chop the spring onions, watercress and frizzy endive.
Put the last four mentioned ingredients into a salad bowl or serving dish
and dress them generously with a pungent garlicky and mustardy vinaigrette.
Add all the other ingredients and toss again. Serve with good breads, home
made or something like Marks &amp; Spencer's walnut bread, warm and crusty from
the oven.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Food for Thought: Bootleggers' Beluga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MCDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAVIAR business has been in a black mood recently. With prices about to
be quoted on the imported spring catch in the Caspian, the usual price war
is going on to dump old stock before the new 'crop' arrives in the
warehouses. While caviar importers undercut one another, Taste magazine has
contributed to the turmoil by publishing the results of a Beluga tasting
held at Christmas. It concluded that Sainsbury's pasteurised Beluga was
better than all but one of the tested caviars. With no wish to pour scorn on
Sainsbury's, pasteurisation for caviar is possibly even more lethal than it
is for wine or cheese; it hardens the eggs, destroys the flavour and renders
the caviar inert.
It was not the high praise given to Sainsbury's however, which caused most
grief in the Taste tasting, but the accusation that one of the caviar
companies had not been selling Beluga at all, but rather cheaper Oscietre
eggs.
On April 22 the company in question, La Princesse d'Isenbourg, invited
customers and members of the press to try their caviars and prove that there
was no truth in the allegations. In the presence of Princesse d'Isenbourg
(actually a German-Russian Furstin von Ysenburg from Hessen) we all
gleefully tucked into some very good Beluga and Oscietre and thanked God for
the internal squabbles of the caviar trade.
Accusations of this sort are not new. Several importing houses have been
locked in a feud over markets for some time and tempers have frayed as the
markets narrow with recession. Nor is it unheard of for importers to cheat
customers by packing Beluga pots with Oscietre, but those with established
reputations, such as W. G. White, Grivan, Caviar Kaspia, R. E. Campbell,
Caviar House and the calumnied Princesse d'Isenbourg have no interest in
trying to pass off lower-priced Oscietre as Beluga and perhaps wipe out
their customer base overnight.
Not all the caviar on the market, however, comes from them. About 20 per
cent of the eggs in restaurants come from bootleggers selling second-rate
eggs packaged for the domestic Russian or Iranian markets.
Restaurateurs would be wise to give bootlegged caviar a wide berth as they
risk the health of their customers by serving a food which has been stored
in unhygenic conditions.
Nicky Kerman of Scotts in Mayfair and Overtons, the fish restaurants, says
Polish sailors have become an occupational hazard for him. He says that by
the law of averages an occasional tin may contain decent caviar but he buys
all his supply from reputable importers.
Gavin Rankin of importers Caviar Kaspia stressed the simplicity of caviar.
There are three fish: Beluga, Oscietre and Sevruga of which the Beluga
accounts for less than 2 per cent of the catch. They are the same fish
whether caught by the Russians or the Iranians. Russian Beluga tends to be a
little better than Iranian and Iranian Oscietre better than Russian.
Opinions vary on the small slate grey Sevruga. Beluga occasionally comes
marked 000, meaning a super-sized egg, and traditionally companies have
labelled this 'royal' or 'imperial' Beluga. Oscietre is either toast/gold or
dark grey/black.
'If you want a failsafe method to ensure that it really is Beluga caviar
that you've bought and not Oscietre,' Rankin told me, 'all you have to do is
this.' He took three grains of Oscietre caviar in a teaspoon and crushed
them into his plate; the juice was golden yellow. Then taking the same
number of Beluga eggs he crushed those too leaving a smear of dark grey oil
on the plate: 'It works every time.'

FT  04 MAY 91 / Food: An eye for history - Nicholas Lander recommends a
favourite London hotel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE I began writing this column I have been unable to recommend one of my
favourite London hotels, Hazlitt's. It has a lot to offer - West End
location, comfort and very reasonable prices (Pounds 86 per night for a
double room) - but no restaurant.
However, in January 1990 Hazlitt's proprietors, Douglas Blain and Peter
McKay, doubled the size of their empire with the acquisition of the Gore
Hotel, SW7, and in September 1990 became landlords of Bistrot 190, now a
highly successful restaurant, on the ground floor of the Gore. This is a
story of how with business sense and flair you can fall into two hazardous
businesses - the hotel and restaurant trades - and land on your feet.
Blain and McKay met in 1977 on the committee of the Spitalfields Historic
Buildings Trust rescuing derelict Georgian buildings. Enthusiasts for aged
buildings (Hazlitt's was built in 1716, the Gore in the 1850s) they began by
buying two houses built in 1725 from British Land for Pounds 2,000,
renovating them and then selling them for Pounds 90,000 - a percentage
profit they have never repeated]
In 1986 they heard that three adjacent buildings in Soho which had been
nurses' homes for the Women's Hospital next door were coming up for auction.
Checking in the Survey of London (an architectural survey of all the
buildings in central London dating back to 1800) Blain discovered that
underneath the awful paint was the original wooden panelling; this gave them
the confidence to lodge the winning bid and look around for finance.
Their dream of a small, comfortable and intimate hotel was initially greeted
with disdain: surveyors told them to pull the buildings down, the local
authority immediately assumed it was a cover for a brothel. Their
persistence, helped by a supportive bank manager, won through and the first
part of the hotel opened in September 1986.
Hazlitt's opened with six bedrooms, just two bathrooms and a room rate of
only 30. But guests, it seemed, particularly Americans, wanted creature
comforts as well.
The rest of Hazlitt's rooms were immediately brought up to expectations and
business flourished. McKay, with some time in the film world, sees an hotel
interior as a film set and has delighted in filling Hazlitt's, and now the
Gore, with pictures, prints and antiques.
Simple, old and mellow were the criteria for the design, the only plastic to
be allowed in the rooms being that of the telephone and the TV.
They also decided that, surrounded by Soho's restaurants, Hazlitt's would
offer only a continental breakfast; no bar, room or restaurant service. The
hotel would offer instead the kind of personal service they would expect
when travelling themselves and, with a predominantly female staff, they now
boast 60 per cent repeat business.
As they appreciated the limitations imposed by the lack of a hotel
restaurant, Blain and McKay pinpointed four areas of London in which they
felt they could repeat Hazlitt's success. They saw the attractions of West
London - with publishers and advertisers moving there - and the lure of the
Albert Hall.
In November 1989 an agent introduced them to the owner of the Gore and by
January 16 1990 it was theirs, another suitable canvas for McKay. He
discovered a wooden staircase not even on the plans and plenty of
idiosyncratic design.
On the first floor, where the 1950's the Elizabethan Rooms dining club had
prospered in the 1950s, a lovely minstrel's gallery still survives (ask for
room 101).
But there was considerable work to be done. Fifty-four new bathrooms had to
be installed, the staff organised and the restaurant, smelling of stale
scampi and chips, was closed immediately.
Although attracted to the restaurant business the partners were aware of its
pitfalls. They had, however, unwittingly, become landlords of a restaurant,
as the Gore's basement had been sub-leased to a consortium establishing the
BES-funded restaurant and club, 190 Queensgate.
A year ago Blain and McKay approached the head of the consortium, Roy
Ackerman, and its chef, Anthony Worrall-Thompson to see if they would be
interested in running the hotel's restaurant and room service. They were and
the ensuing arrangement has brought the best out of both sides.
Blain and McKay provided the hardware, the fixtures and fittings and, most
importantly, the hotel computer which has helped to monitor costs (often a
chef's blindspot). Worrall-Thompson has been left to concentrate on the
cooking. And, as proprietors and landlords, they retain ultimate control.
Worrall-Thompson's original menu was rejected because Blain and McKay felt
it was too pretentious and expensive. Worrall-Thompson came back with others
which have pleased customers and landlords alike and the Bistrot has served
more than 25,000 meals since it opened last September.
The room and the menu suit each other well. Large windows on two sides let
in natural light and McKay's policy has been pursued with the interior -
paint it cream and cover it with pictures (there are 4,500 in the hotel).
The food, with its emphasis on the Mediterranean, is varied, healthy and of
generous proportions: pumpkin and pepper soup, garlic terrine, bruschetta
with plum tomatoes, chicory tarte tatin, lamb shank with flageolet beans and
rosemary polenta are just some of the temptations.
Prices follow the owners' principle of being slightly below the market - the
average spend at lunch is Pounds 17 per person, at dinner Pounds 20. As the
Gore prospers Blain and McKay are looking to expand.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Wine: Drinking by numbers - How a grasp of figures can help
you choose wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH connoisseurs tend to be wary of mixing numbers and wine. Unlike so
many of our slavish American counterparts, we rather disapprove of buying
something as subjective as wine on the basis of scores out of 100 allotted
by other palates, however glorified.
There is one way however that a keen grasp of numbers can steer consumers
towards wine quality. It has nothing to do with maths but quite a lot to do
with geography, the geography of France in particular.
With characteristic logic, the French number their equivalent of counties,
departements, alphabetically. Thus, the first two digits of a French
postcode or the last two digits of a car numberplate, exactly pinpoint a
specific area of the blessed hexagone. A keen student of licence plates such
as myself delights in spotting a driver from Ain by his 01, or one from
Aisne by his 02.
Perhaps more usefully, knowledge of a few key departement numbers can
greatly help the interpretation of wine labels - particularly those on the
legion of increasingly impressive bottlings from France's less famous wine
regions - Vin de Pays des Coteaux des Collines Inconnues and the like.
This struck me forcibly as I was trying a line-up of new Chardonnays the
other day. I began with a sad, feeble little thing called Domaine de Collin
Rozier (about Pounds 3.50 in Tesco). Like so many cheap wines carrying the
name of today's most fashionable grape variety, it was a Chardonnay in name
only and bore no tasteable relationship to the cool steeliness of Chablis,
the concentration of great white burgundy or the lush Chardonnays of
California, Australia and New Zealand. It was simply a neutral, dry white
wine with more or less the same characteristics as an ordinary white vin de
table.
It was labelled as a Vin de Pays d'Oc, a country wine from the Languedoc in
southern France, and according to the back label came from 'the largest
mature Chardonnay vineyard in the south of France.' Maybe they planted a
less-than-brilliant clone, maybe the vines were encouraged to be too
productive to be capable of producing a wine of much character, but it was a
number on the label that gave me the major clue to the wine's mass-produced
character. 'Bottled by G Badriou,' it said (so far, so good), followed by
'69220'. Aha] The telltale 69 is the call sign of the Rhone departement
which includes Lyons and much of Beaujolais with its many near-industrial
wine bottlers. G Badriou may sound like a charming one-man band, but I bet
it is one of many names used by a pretty big bottling plant that ships in
wine by tanker from all over France. In my experience, the further from the
vineyard a wine is bottled, the more character and integrity is sacrificed.
The numbers of the departements that are actually in the Languedoc, as
opposed to hundreds of miles up the motorway, are from east to west 30 for
Gard, 34 for the sprawling Herault, 11 for Aude and Roussillon, south
towards the Spanish border, is 66 for Pyrenees Orientales (where Oddbins
have found a really characterful peachy, lightly oaked Cotes du Roussillon
Blanc 1988 from the Rivesaltes co-operative, at 66600, for just Pounds 4.49,
a good price for so much culinary useful power and balance).
The next Chardonnay I tried was at the very opposite end of the character
spectrum and proudly bore the code 34530 showing it was indeed raised and
bottled in the Herault departement of the Languedoc, at the Domaine St
Martin de la Garrigue, a Vin de Pays des Coteaux de Bessilles, if that
leaves you any wiser. I tasted the 1989 vintage which is now sold out and is
being replaced by a 1990 that is presumably even more powerful and which
Adnams of Southwold should be selling at Pounds 5.95 from next month or so.
Adnams' wine buyer Simon Loftus is famously keen on wines with character and
this one oozed it. At 13.2 per cent alcohol it was about as potent as a
Montrachet and almost as ambitious. With aromas of butterscotch restrained
by hints of green fruit, this wild wine left me impressed but wondering
rigid quality control parameters of, say, Marks &amp; Spencer. It is probably
their loss although I suspect that St Martin's owner Monsieur Henry, who
describes himself on the label as a 'vigneron-eleveur', was better at the
first, outdoor half of the job in 1989. The property is certainly one to
watch.
The third Chardonnay was my favourite of the line-up and came from an even
more obscure departement in wine terms. Domaine de Ribonnet 1989 (Pounds
5.99 Oddbins) is from 31 which makes it a Vin de Pays de la Haute Garonne
produced south of Toulouse in what is almost terra incognita of the vine.
Made by the ambitious winemaker of nearby Chateau Montauriol, one of
Fronton's beefier representatives, this Chardonnay seems well worth its
premium over the mass production Tesco model. It is made on a lavishly
maintained Swiss-owned property from 12-year-old vines with yields well
below Burgundian levels.
It too notches up 13' of alcohol and has lovely ripe Chardonnay flavours, a
little cooler and cleaner than St Martin's, and with a fair old whack of new
but fairly restrained oak. It reminded me of nothing so much as one of the
best cuvees of oak-matured Chardonnay from Limoux (code number 11 for Aude)
 -which is perhaps not surprising since the Domaine de Ribonnet, like
Limoux, is on the south-western cusp of Atlantic and Mediterranean climates.
My line-up ended with two further examples of Chardonnay as she is typically
wrought at the moment, a lush Australian and a wildly overpriced Burgundian.
Oases of real quality and value are undoubtedly to be found in the French
regions at the moment, but you may need a map, a good memory and the list
below to identify them from the label.
Be wary of wines whose bottlers' codes begin with 76 for Rouen or 75, 78 or
91 for Greater Paris. These will have been shipped north in bulk and may
well have shed some of their character and guts en route.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Allowable losses on the
expiry of options
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I UNDERSTAND that the abandonment of a traded option is treated for CGT as a
disposal at nil value, so that the indexed cost becomes an allowable loss.
Can you tell me whether this treatment also applies to bond warrants dealt
in on the London Stock Exchange.
My inquiry relates more specifically to Phibro Salomon No 1 Warrants, which
expired worthless on 13 November 1990.
No allowable loss accrues on the expiry of any option to acquire or dispose
of qualifying corporate bonds or designated gilt-edged securities because of
section 29(2) and 67(1) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979, as amended.
The definition of 'qualifying corporate bonds' is to be found in section 64
of the Finance Act 1984, as amended.
Subject to that exclusion, indexed allowable losses accrue on the expiry of
options of the following types, by virtue of section 137(4) of the Capital
Gains Tax Act 1979, as amended:
(a) an option (including an option warrant) which at the time of expiry is
quoted on a recognised stock exchange or on a recognised futures exchange;
(b) an option relating to shares or securities granted by a member of a
recognised stock exchange, provided that - if the member is acting as agent
for a non-member - the underlying shares or securities are dealt in on a
recognised stock exchange (not necessarily the exchange of which the agent
grantor is a member);
c) an option relating to shares or securities granted (as principal) by an
authorised person or a listed institution, as defined in the Financial
Services Act 1986.
That list is not exhaustive, but probably covers the types of option which
interest you.
The list was shorter before April 29, 1988 (the day specified in the Finance
(No 2) Act 1987 (Commencement) Order 1988).
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Diary of a private investor): The
rights of spring / Questioning companies' motives for raising money through
rights issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM beginning to feel a bit left out. In the past few months, more than 50
UK public companies have announced rights issues. I have not had shares in
any of them.
Indeed, the last rights issue in which I participated was for Sycamore
Holdings in September last year.
I first bought shares in Sycamore in 1989. The company manufactured garden
furniture and imported barbecues from the US. I thought that a hot summer
would do wonders for its sales. It also had takeover attractions, as then
the company was capitalised at less than Pounds 3.75m. I hoped someone might
be interested in using it as a 'shell' for bigger things.
However, I soon got bored with the company's lacklustre share price
performance and reduced my holding.
The company produced poor trading results, and last September announced a
two-for-one rights issue at 10p per new share.
I took up my rights in full because accompanying the rights issue was the
statement that Bill Rhodes would be joining the board as a non-executive
director and Peter Hopkins would become managing director. Both men had been
directors of Williams Holdings and Thomas Robinson Group during a period
when they had done much to improve the share price performance of those
companies.
I hoped they would do the same for Sycamore - especially as they would both
be taking a large shareholding in the company.
Sycamore's share price has now more than doubled from the rights issue
price.
It seems to me that in the current Gadarene rush to raise money by rights
issues that investors ought to be asking themselves if the directors of
those companies are putting their own money into the businesses, too.
What is the rights issue money to be used for? If it is an attempt to help
bail out the company from horrendous debts, and the existing management
remains, then should the rights have much appeal? I think not.
However, if the money raised is to be used for expansion purposes and the
management is sound, or is to be assisted by new directors with good track
records, then the rights could have some appeal.
Before taking up a rights issue, I also ask myself: if the current share
price was the same as the rights issue price, and the company was not having
a rights issue, would I buy more shares in the company? If the answer is
'no', then I look for extra reasons (if any) why the rights issue should
give the company increased investment appeal.
When there is a flood of rights issues (like now), I begin to wonder if this
is due to a pent-up demand for extra cash that has only just been released,
or is this dash for extra cash simply that some company directors feel that,
if their company does not raise extra funds now, it may soon be too late for
them to do so.
Are they expecting a downturn in the market - or even more difficult trading
conditions - that would make it much less easy to have a rights issue later
in the year, or even next year?
In the past, when there has been a rush of rights issues, there has also
been much more takeover activity than at present. Although takeovers have
increased in recent months, it can hardly be called a boom.
I find this somewhat disconcerting. For example, take a company such as
Herrburger Brooks. It manufactures piano keyboards and office furniture. I
bought shares in it in 1985 for 60p each, believing that it had considerable
'shell' potential. In April, its 71.1 per cent shareholder, Kimball
International Inc, made a takeover offer worth 220p cash per share, valuing
the whole company at Pounds 2.9m.
If the market really was booming, with entrepreneurs looking to make
fortunes, surely Herrburger Brooks would have attracted interest from
someone months ago who could have sold the manufacturing interests of the
company to Kimball, while keeping Herrburger's share listing in order to use
it help expand the company into related or other activities.
The lack of interest in investment trusts is also rather disappointing.
Instead of yet another boring rights issue, a company seeking to raise extra
funds could take over an investment trust standing at a hefty discount to
its net asset value, liquidate most of the trust's shareholdings, and then
utilise the cash proceeds.
I bought shareholdings in a number of investment trusts earlier this year,
hoping for such activity. It has not happened. Why? Because taking over a
trust is not as quick as a rights issue? I also hoped that some smaller
trusts, such as Gresham House and TR Technology with estimated discounts on
net asset value of over 60 per cent, would find increasing appeal to
investors. This, too, does not seem to have happened.
Add to this the fact that the other companies in which I am a shareholder
appear not to want extra cash for expansion, and it seems to confirm my view
that there is considerable uncertainty among professional investors and
company directors as to the future of the market and general trading
conditions.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Share transfer to save on
tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL the tax information for married couples, I have read none considers a
situation where the husband is without income, benefits of any kind, or
other emoluments, and who is below pensionable age (62).
Would we benefit if my younger working wife, who claims my allowances,
transfers her nominal holdings in British Gas and British Telecom to me. We
are without issue.
If your wife wishes to give you her shareholdings, then you should ensure
that the dividends are paid into an account to which she has no access
(otherwise the dividends might be deemed still to be her income, under
section 674A of the Income &amp; Corporation Taxes Act 1988). Anyone thinking of
giving away shares acquired under a privatisation offer should wait until
she or he has qualified for the appropriate free shares or other incentives
not to change the registration before a specified date. Ask you tax
inspector for the free pamphlets IR82 (Independent taxation: a guide for
husbands on a low income) and IR112 (How to claim a repayment of income
tax).

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Keep up communication with
your tax inspector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU stated (Q&amp;A Briefcase, March 30) that it is the responsibility of the
taxpayer to check that the right amount of tax has been paid. How long has
this been operating? I have always assumed that if the Inland Revenue did
not raise an assessment, or under-assessed an individual, one could get away
with it.
I bought some shares under the Business Expansion Scheme in 1986, receiving
tax relief on my investment from the Inland Revenue. I sold some of these
shares before the minimum five-year period had elapsed and understand that I
am liable to pay back to the Inland Revenue that part of the tax relief that
relates to the number of shares I sold. Do I have to advise the Inland
Revenue that I have disposed of these shares or can I wait until the Revenue
raises a demand for the tax?
Section 310 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (which re-enacts
the original 1983 legislation) you are obliged to notify your tax inspector
of the sale within 60 days. Failure to do so risks a potential penalty of
Pounds 300 under section 98 of the Taxes Management Act 1970. The rules are
outlined in the free pamphlet on the BES: IR51.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Demand on arrears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING abolition of the 'earnings rule', my wife applied for state
retirement pension in May 1990 backdated to October 2, 1989.
The application was accepted and the first payment made at the end of June
1990, including arrears from October 2, 1989.
The Inland Revenue demanded payment of tax on the arrears assessing them as
1989/90 income, notwithstanding the fact that the pension was only applied
for, and paid during the 1990/91 income tax year. Is this treatment correct?
Yes, under section 41(2) of the Finance Act 1989: 'As regards any particular
year of assessment, income tax shall be charged on the amount of the pension
or other benefit accruing in respect of the year; and this shall apply
irrespective of when any amount is actually paid in respect of the pension
or other benefit.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE 16 mature but healthy poplar trees about 2ft from my neighbour's
hedge. His house is about 50ft away from this hedge. My neighbour without
notice employed a tree surgeon to have these trees lopped to reduce the
height although I had them lopped just a few months before.
Can he charge the work to me?
If in future there are branches overhanging his land, has he got a right to
enter my land and have them cut?
Is there any legal precedent or authoritative book?
Your neighbour cannot charge you for work which he has carried out to your
trees. If the lopping involved crossing into the air-space or coming on to
the land on your side of the boundary you would have a trespass claim
against him. Although your neighbour can have branches on his side of the
boundary cut, he is not entitled to enter your land. The authoritative
text-book is Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, 16th Edition.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: An advisers' exam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOUR FINANCIAL adviser may soon be sitting an exam. A new organisation, the
Society of Financial Advisers (SOFA), has been established to promote
professional standards in the financial adviser community.
Only advisers who pass examinations set by the Chartered Insurance Institute
(CII) - and who agree to abide by a strict code of conduct - will be
eligible for membership of SOFA.
The new organisation will attempting to remedy perceived deficiencies in the
financial advisory sector, identified by Dr Oonagh McDonald in her report
for the Securities and Investments Board, entitled 'Training and Competence
within the Financial Services Industry.'
The CII has already introduced the Financial Planning Certificate (FPC) and
this will be improved. Candidates will be required to pass papers in three
subjects: marketing, salesmanship and investor protection; life assurance
and other investments; and pensions. There will be optional papers in
mortgages and personal general insurance.
Those who pass the FPC will be entitled to take the Advanced Financial
Planning Certificate (AFPC) entitling them to membership of SOFA. The AFPC
will require candidates to sit three papers, with taxation and trusts one
compulsory paper. The other two papers will be chosen from personal
investment planning, corporate investment planning, business management and
marketing.
Once an applicant has passed the exam, he will be entitled to have the
status 'Member of the Society of Financial Advisers' on his business cards
and stationery. Annual membership costs Pounds 50.
The hope is that by the end of this year, several thousand advisers will
have passed.
Clients can thus start to look out for advisers, with SOFA membership, in
1992. A professional qualification is no guarantee of excellent advice but
clients will at least have a guide to which advisers have proved their
competence. The new society should be welcomed by clients and advisers
alike.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Unit trusts code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIT TRUST investors are often only interested in the prices of their
holdings. The financial statements they receive every half year may simply
be given a cursory glance before being thrown in the bin.
But this week the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO)
published a Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) on the way financial
statements must be presented to unitholders.
What should the unitholder look for in the accounts? Peter Jeffreys of Fund
Research, the analytical group, says that while each fund is different,
there are some rules of thumb.
'Looking at the portfolio' he says, 'the rule is the fewer the holdings the
greater the volatility. The average is probably around 60 to 80 holdings.'
However, Jeffreys has found as few as 30 holdings in one fund, and as many
as 200 in another.
Another clue is the percentage of the fund invested in the largest ten
holdings. 'The higher the percentage invested in the top ten, the greater
the volatility' says Jeffreys. The average is around 20 to 30 per cent but
Jeffreys has found some funds with as little as 15 per cent in top ten and
others with four or five holdings, each equivalent to 5 or 6 per cent of the
portfolio.
Jeffreys also advises investors to look at the balance of the portfolio to
see whether it has a heavy concentration in one sector. Portfolio activity -
the rate at which a manager turns over the fund - is also important. If the
manager is trading frequently, that could mean that the fund's growth will
be swallowed up by costs, but Jeffreys stresses that good fund managers can
sometimes generate heavy turnover.
To measure turnover, Jeffreys suggests that investors first discover whether
the fund is expanding or contracting.
For an expanding fund, divide the value of securities sold by the average
size of the fund over the year. For a contracting fund, divide the value of
securities bought by the average value of the fund.
The extreme values, according to Jeffreys, are a low of 15 to 20 per cent
and a high of 300 per cent, with an average of 40 to 60 per cent.

BRITISH Petroleum is ex-pected on Thursday to announce a loss of around
Pounds 50m for the first quarter compared with a profit of Pounds 344m for
the comparable period on the historic cost basis.
If changes in the value of oil stocks are stripped out, the accounting
method favoured by the group, the company is expected to show a small
increase in profits of around Pounds 35m. The first quarter's stock losses
are expected to be as much as Pounds 425m, compared with Pounds 70m last
year.
After losing out to Otto Versand in the bidding war for Next's Grattan mail
order business, Sears, the retailing conglomerate, has been left looking
rather forlorn. That impression may be strengthened when the company
announces its full-year results on Thursday showing pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 110m, a severe reversal on the Pounds 231.4m it achieved the year
before.
Other large companies reporting next week include Jefferson Smurfit, the
Irish packaging group, on Tuesday; and on Wednesday SmithKline Beecham, the
drugs maker, and Trafalgar House, the construction, shipping and hotels
group.
Tate and Lyle, the world's largest sweeteners group which is trying to take
over Bundaberg Sugar of Australia, should report pre-tax interim profits on
Wednesday of Pounds 92.5m compared with Pounds 87.5m last year.

THE STOCK Exchange is formally committed to wider share ownership but on
occasions its actions seem to contradict its rhetoric.
For example, last month it became embroiled in a row with Ceefax and Oracle,
the two providers of television teletext services.
More than 8m TV sets in the UK are geared to receive BBC's Ceefax and and
ITV's Oracle service, both of which are free, and a considerable number are
watched by small investors interested in the stock market.
Hence there was widespread disappointment at the beginning of April when the
quality of share price information on the two services deteriorated sharply.
With no warning to the viewers who follow share price changes on Ceefax and
Oracle, the frequency of price updates was cut. For some months, prices had
been updated every half an hour, but suddenly they were back to being
changed every hour and a half.
The ideal form of share-price data reflects the ebb and flow of the market,
allowing investors to make buy and sell decisions on the finest terms. A
system whereby prices change every half hour falls short of this 'real-time'
ideal, but at least comes close. By contrast, the investor who only sees
prices at 9am, 10.30am and at midday misses out on much of the morning's
market action.
The two services received a flood of complaints after the change, which they
passed to the Stock Exchange, together with complaints of their own. Ceefax
and Oracle said that the Exchange was acting against the principle of wider
share ownership.
The Stock Exchange's response was that the move to half-hourly updates in
January had been a temporary response to the Gulf War, during which markets
were expected to be more volatile than usual.
As a special concession to the millions of teletext users, the Exchange had
decided to speed up the flow of information. Now that the war had ended, the
Exchange had decided to revert to its old practice of updating prices every
90 minutes, it said.
This argument did not carry much weight with the investors who had become
used to the improved service.
The Stock Exchange then put its foot in deeper when an incorrectly briefed
press officer said that real-time information could be bought for just
Pounds 65 a year.
The officer omitted the fact that it costs Pounds 25,000 a year to obtain
the flow of real-time data from the Exchange. The Pounds 65 is extra - it is
the charge on each computer terminal by which the information is
distributed.
Screen-based real-time share information is available, but at considerably
more than Pounds 65 a year. The Stock Exchange's own Market Eye service
requires an up-front investment of between Pounds 870 and Pounds 1,680 for
hardware, plus an annual subscription charge of Pounds 1,016. (Tel:
071-410-6888 for further details.)
Pont Data charges between Pounds 200 a month for real-time information (less
for a restricted service) (Tel: 071-256-6234), while BT Citiservice charges
a subscription of Pounds 42 per quarter, plus a charge of 45p per minute
(Tel: 0442 237000). In both cases, the investor would have to pay extra for
the computer hardware, although a TV set can be updated for about Pounds
150.
There are also at least four telephone-based services, which offer share
price and other financial information. These are: British Telecom's Citycall
(0898 121220); Financial Times's Cityline (0836 4300 01); TIC's Sharecall
(0898 345 345); and Telephone Information Services' Teleshare (0898 500
500).
Oracle and Ceefax's argument is that they are doing the Exchange a favour by
disseminating share price information to small investors. Given the
Exchange's commitment to wider share ownership, why did it downgrade the
teletext service?
A problem is that Oracle makes money out of its share price service by
charging companies to have their prices quoted and selling advertising space
while the BBC is forbidden from making money out of the service.
The Exchange is perhaps frustrated that it cannot share the revenues
generated by Oracle and it cannot cut a separate deal with Oracle as it is
contractually bound to treat both teletext providers equally.
The Exchange says that it has an obligation to those who pay for the
privilege of dis-tributing real-time information. Ceefax and Oracle do pay
the Exchange, but not as much as the Pont Data and Citiservice.
The Exchange appears to be putting its own short-term commercial interests
ahead of the principle of wider share ownership.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Chancery plays phoenix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCERY, the BES sponsor which was critically damaged earlier this year
when its parent bank went into administration, has been resurrected under
the wing of Close Brothers, the merchant bank.
The four-strong management team, and two support staff, have now joined
Close Brothers Investment, a newly created subsidiary.
The BES companies which the team launched over the past five years will
continue to be monitored by remaining staff at Chancery, headed by John
Dodwell, who founded the division. Chancery will not float any new BES
companies in this tax year.
Craig Reader, previously managing director at Chancery, said the team would
attempt to 'do a phoenix impression' at Close Brothers. The company wants to
make BES issues by the end of September, when the opportunity to carry
forward tax relief from last year ends.
Its particular interest will be in 'growth assured' companies, which attempt
to cut the risk in BES property investments by obtaining promises from
housing associations to buy back properties at a fixed price after five
years. Close Brothers will also look at tax shelter investments in
enterprise zone property. Reader said he also hoped to explore the buy-back
concept for trading companies, rather than assured tenancy property
companies, although he admitted the upper limit for investment of Pounds
750,000 in these companies was a problem.
Chancery was second in the BES market before the trouble hit its liquidator,
but several other sponsors successfully launched schemes with 'buy-back'
arrangements towards the end of the last tax year. Its enterprise zone trust
deal for a property in Docklands was sponsored instead by Greig Middleton,
and raised Pounds 10.72m.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: The ideal four-point framework for
fair provision
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS is the pensions framework I would like to see for the present and
future generations of pensioners.
1 A high level of flat rate basic pension well above the poverty level, say
three-quarters of national average earnings.
This pension would be available to all persons, with married men and women
not in employment receiving credit from their spouses' contributions.
It would be funded on the present pay-as-you-go system with the current
generation of employed and self-employed paying for the current pensions.
2 The employee or the self-employed would make his or her own arrangements
to provide for any additional pension, either individually or collectively
through employers or trade or professional bodies.
Collective arrangements would ensure that people changing jobs are treated
fairly and that the value of pensions is maintained. But otherwise, they
should have flexibility in their benefit structure.
Employees would fund these additional pensions themselves and not rely on
future generations for the payment of earning-related pensions.
As such, a state earnings-related scheme would not exist unless it could be
properly funded.
Above all, the government, employers and individuals must face up to the
cost of providing pensions and not try to fudge the issue by deferring
costs.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Twenty years of muddle over pensions -
Pensions Correspondent Eric Short, who retires this week, looks at the
industry he has covered for nearly two decades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN I started writing on pensions nearly two decades ago the UK pensions
scene was in complete turmoil.
As I leave the pensions world today, it is still in a state of chaos in
spite of the best endeavours over the intervening 20 years of the
government, the European Community and industry practitioners.
At the beginning of the 1970s, there were two worlds for pensions - those
employees in occupational pension scheme who could look forward to a good
pension if they stayed with their employer until retirement - and those who
had to rely on totally inadequate state benefits.
While everyone agrees that there should be one world in pensions, no-one can
agree on how to reach it.
Twenty years ago, the political vision was for a comprehensive state scheme
providing earnings-related pensions - complemented by occupational schemes -
and individual provision for those such as the self-employed.
After three abortive attempts, the notorious State Earnings-Related Pension
Scheme, known as Serps, was started in 1978. Those of us who should have
known better, thought this was a pensions framework, which, with
improvement, could provide the necessary stability to enable people to
receive adequate pensions.
That stability proved to be extremely brittle. Although the benefits
provided under Serps are far from generous, the present Tory administration
says they would present too large a financial burden on the working
population by 2020.
So in the late 1980s pensions were back in the melting pot. Sir Norman
Fowler undertook his famous review, the result of which was the emasculation
of Serps, the ending of compulsory membership of occupational pension
schemes and the introduction of a new style personal pension which could be
used to opt out of Serps.
Indeed, employees not previous contracted-out of Serps were entitled to
receive a 2 per cent incentive contribution, labelled a bribe by the Labour
party and trade unions, if they used a personal pension to contract-out of
Serps.
Under the present framework, the involvement of the state in pension
provision has been severely cut back and individuals have to make their own
arrangements to get an adequate retirement income.
The government can claim success for its changes in that about four million
employees have contracted-out of Serps with personal pensions, though at a
cost estimated at Pounds 6bn to the National Insurance fund  - a bonanza for
life companies and their salesmen.
However, this framework is extremely unstable.
Elements in the Conservative Party want the government to continue its
reforms by abolishing Serps. There are also whispers that state benefits
should be cut even further by enabling people to opt out of the basic
pension.
The Labour Party is pledged to return to 1978 by restoring Serps to full
benefits, ending incentive payments and making it impossible for employees
in the future to use a personal pension to contract-out of Serps, though
existing arrangements will continue.
One can sympathise with the appeal by Alan Fishman, chairman of the
Association of Consulting Actuaries, for a national pensions policy which
would agree in broad outlines the level of pension to be provided and the
roles of the various groups in providing that pension.
However, I feel that a national pensions policy is as remote as a political
consensus on how to finance local authorities.
The government has two major pension difficulties to settle - equalising
pension ages and resolving the question of who owns and operates company
pension schemes.
Last year's European Court judgment in Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange has
forced company schemes to have a common retirement age and equal benefits
for men and women, though there is still confusion about the phasing-in of
this equalisation.
Social pressures and employment policy have already influenced many schemes
to bring in a common pension age and some degree of flexibility in age at
which employees retire.
However, although the debate on equalising pension ages in the state scheme
commenced in earnest in the mid-1970s, the government has given no
indication about whether and how it intends to move away from the present
system of a pension age of 65 for men and 60 for women, with no facility to
take the state pension before these ages.
One feels that the lack of action by the government is because it does not
know how to change without incurring immense logistical and financial
difficulties and upsetting a many women voters.
I fear that nothing will happen until the government is forced to equalise
by the European Community - and the relevant third draft directive on this
subject has already been several years in gestation without any sign of
birth.
Company pension schemes providing salary related benefits have enjoyed
substantial surpluses arising from the favourable investment conditions in
the 1980s and reduced membership caused by widespread redundancies.
Such companies have taken contribution holidays which have caused resentment
among members who did not receive a corresponding share of the surplus. The
result has been a debate about who owns the surplus and the correct
relationship between employer, trustee, employee and pensioner in the
management of schemes.
A series of High Court judgments over the past two or three years on various
aspects of this difficulty have failed to produced a clear answer.
Legislation appears inevitable.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Checklist
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT pointers can be given to individuals to prepare themselves for eventual
retirement?
First, they cannot rely on the state, whatever the sympathies of the
government. They need to make their own provision to ensure an adequate
income.
Individuals should therefore assess the opportunities offered by private
provision: either an employer's scheme, if there is one; or a personal
pension.
Second, assuming the employer operates a company scheme, individuals should
try to compare the benefits it offers with those provided by personal
pensions.
A company scheme providing pay-related benefits guarantees the pension in
terms of salary at or near retirement, with the employer taking the
financial risks (and rewards) and meeting the expenses. Such a pension is
relatively hassle-free.
With a personal pension, the individual has no guarantee as to the level of
pension, but has to take the risks (and reap the rewards) of investment
performance, managing the pension arrangements and making adequate
contributions from an early stage. The charges can be heavy, so try to
discover which life company has the lowest expenses. Additional benefits
such as life cover have to be paid for.
Third, because of financial services regulations, it is difficult for
individuals to get comprehensive advice from one source.
The company pension scheme adviser cannot deal with personal pensions while
the independent financial adviser, unless he is fee-based, will be reluctant
to recommend a client to join the company scheme.
Individuals may have to get advice from two sources and collate both sets of
information before making their decision.
Fourth, company pensions generally favour the stayer, married employees,
older employees and those not prepared to make much effort regarding pension
provision.
Personal pensions favour the job mover, the younger, single employee and
those who want to do their own thing.
Finally, be prepared to continually review and alter the arrangements in the
light of changing circumstances. Good luck.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: The range of schemes available
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The current pensions framework consists of:
The basic flat rate state pension of Pounds 52 a week for a single person or
Pounds 83.25 per week for a married couple. Every person qualifies for this
pension, subject to paying the required contributions.
Serps - employees automatically belong to Serps unless contracted-out.
Employers can contract their members out of Serps and provide the benefits
through a company scheme. Employees not in a company scheme can contract out
of Serps with a personal pension.
Employees, whether in or out of Serps, can provide for further benefits with
a personal pension.
Company schemes usually provide higher benefits in addition to the
equivalent Serps benefits. However, employees in company schemes can provide
addition pension though an Additional Voluntary Contribution (AVC) scheme,
either through an in-house arrangement or through a free standing AVC from a
life company or other provider.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (London Markets): The empty rituals of
a bygone age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHTEENTH century travellers to the great sites of vanished European
civilisations often found, among the shattered wreckage of once-mighty
edifices, groups of superstitious peasants living a miserable subsistence
life.
Just like the London stock market, really. Its members, eking out a
hand-to-mouth living, cannot but recall the vanished rituals of their hour
of glory, the great bull market of the 1980s. One such bygone ritual, in
evidence this week, comes under the general heading of the worship of
strange gods; in this case, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average. When the Dow
rises, as it did for much of the week, the London adherents of this belief
are disposed to push up the local market too.
A second relic is the belief that a wave of takeover bids is about to engulf
the major stocks, pushing them to 30, 50 or 100 per cent premiums over their
current valuations, and funnelling a torrent of cash into institutional
coffers. Thus enriched, fund managers will seek to restore their equity
portfolios, bidding prices up yet again.
The news, over the weekend, that the two top men at Allied-Lyons would be
stepping down in the wake of the company's disastrous losses on foreign
currency speculation put that company 'in play' - to use the jargon of the
vanished past - as a potential takeover target. And, for a few days at
least, hopes abounded of a bid not merely for Allied-Lyons but for every
company in the FT-SE about which a half-decent story could be told.
Allied-Lyons shares certainly benefited: the stock rose from 520p at the end
of last week to close at 552p on Friday, up 32p.
Separately, each of these two rituals has a strong fantasy element.
Together, they form a mixture which, for a while at any rate, is capable of
reawakening memories of the good old days - if not of the 1980s themselves,
then at least of the Disneyland version that occurred earlier this year.
The knee-jerk reaction to the Dow is not entirely irrational, of course. If
the Dow is rising because US interest rates are being pushed down, then the
expectation that the US economy is set for economic recovery will make the
shares of UK companies with heavy dependence on the transatlantic market
more attractive.
But a crude unweighted index of 10 companies with particularly heavy US
exposure - the drug companies, BTR, Hanson, Reuters, that sort of thing -
has outperformed the FT-Actuaries All-Share by little more than 1 per cent.
The effect has been distorted by the exceptionally strong performance by
Wellcome after its results on Thursday. Buoyed up by a 10 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits for the half year to March 2, and a sharp leap in
operating margins, the share price rose 63p on the day, to close at 582p. On
Friday, the shares rose again, closing the week at 592p, up 76p or nearly 15
per cent.
Without the Wellcome effect, the US-exposed stocks would have performed
roughly in line with the market as a whole - which argues that London's
reaction to the Dow's move this week has been essentially one of sympathy
rather than calculation. An eighteenth-century traveller would have had no
difficulty in identifying this empty ritual.
The 1990s have their own rituals, of course, some of which were in evidence
this week. Chairmen of underperforming companies, once lying wakeful in the
early mornings for the sound of a dawn raid, must now listen nervously for
the postman's tread. This week he carried what was both literally and
figuratively a 'Dear John' letter for Mr John Fletcher, chairman of Budgens,
the grocery chain.
On Monday, the message for Mr Fletcher was that institutional shareholders,
including IEP Securities, Electra and Gartmore, wanted him out. By
Wednesday, Mr Fletcher was on his way, paying the price for a drop in the
share price from a peak of 252p in 1987 to 45p at Tuesday's close. The stock
ended the week at 40p.
By Friday, the habit had spread. Tace, the engineering group, was facing a
similar institutional revolt, this time led by Norwich Union. Fund managers
have clearly decided that - in the absence of a posse of corporate raiders
to replace underperforming managements - they will do the job themselves.
Another new ritual of the 1990s is the habit of companies of announcing job
reductions and rights issues simultaneously, perhaps to offset the
inherently teenagerish nature of a plea for more cash ('I spent what you
gave me, and now I need some more.')
Whatever the reason, The trend was joined this week by T&amp;N, once better
known as Turner &amp; Newall, which announced that it was cutting 2,500 jobs and
asking for Pounds 119m from shareholders. Perhaps because the City remembers
with affection the money it made on T&amp;N as a turnaround stock in the 1980s,
or perhaps because the company is not in the construction business, the
rights issue was received without too many shrieks. The shares closed the
week at 163p, down 13p.
Another rights issue came from Bank of Scotland. So firmly does the
investment community hold to its faith that this is Britain's best-managed
bank that even the revelation that it had been lending money to some
all-too-feckless Sassenachs failed to dent the enthusiasm with which the
request for Pounds 194m was received. By Friday, the shares were up 2p on
the week, closing at 137p.
After the Conservative party's poor performance in the Thursday's local
elections, the market ended the week on a hesitant note, with the FT-SE
closing at 2,522.7, up 51.4 since the previous Friday. Perhaps just as
important as the political news, however, was the imminent ritual of the
in-lieu-of-May-Day bank holiday, its origins now lost in the mists of time.
How long ago that all seems] Something to do with a chap called Ozymandias,
wasn't it?

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Bottom Line): T&amp;N changes gear as
motor industry suffers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;N's Pounds 119m rights issue, announced this week alongside 2,500 job
cuts, epitomises the twin pressures on UK motor component companies.
Their profits have been affected by falling vehicle production in almost
every market except Germany, but they feel impelled to carry on investing in
cost-saving machinery to stay internationally competitive, particularly
against the Japanese.
The first point is illustrated by some gloomy figures showing the downward
slide of car sales. In the UK, the number sold fell from a record 2.3m in
1989 to 2m last year, with 1.6m to 1.7m forecast for 1991. France and Spain
had first-quarter falls of more than 20 per cent, and US sales were nearly
20 per cent lower in the first two months.
The urge to modernise can be easily understood in the light of a recent
study for the European Commission by the Boston Consulting Group and PRS
Consulting International. Called The Competitive Challenge Facing the
European Automotive Components Industry, it says the Europeans lag behind
the Japanese in terms of productivity, quality, speed of design and
development, and product costs.
Against this background, Colin Hope, chairman of T&amp;N, explained the rights
issue in this way: 'In weak international market conditions, we have not
generated the cash flow to continue our investment programme with moderate
gearing.'
The Pounds 119m proceeds will help to relieve borrowings that had risen to
Pounds 248m by December, giving debt-equity gearing of 49 per cent. Although
1990 also saw a rights issue - a one-for-three to raise Pounds 127m - it was
absorbed by the Dollars 190m (Pounds 111m) purchase of JP Industries, a US
motor parts maker.
Meanwhile the capital spending programme goes on with Pounds 89m laid out
last year and more than Pounds 80m budgeted for 1991. In the last five
years, T&amp;N said Pounds 327m had been spent on modernising factories,
developing products and rationalisation.
A further Pounds 605m, net of disposals, had gone on acquisitions. The
record is held by the Pounds 278m purchase of the engineering group AE,
completed in early 1987.
Leaving aside the reasons Hope volunteered for this week's issue, it is also
significant that the dividend payment was one of the main points of the
announcement. The board said it intended to maintain the total at 10.85p
this year, a figure only 1.4 times covered by 1990 earnings per share of
15.45p. Earnings could decline by 30 per cent this year.
So in addition to its high spending programme, T&amp;N continues as a high yield
stock: 10.3 per cent on the issue price of 140p and 8.8 per cent on
yesterday's close of 163p.
This is some compensation for a share price that has not regained its July
1987 peak of 319p. Since 1986, it has underperformed the market by about 50
per cent. Its earnings record is a miserable minus 9.5 per cent a year
compound as the pile of shares in issue has mounted.
A glance at the group's history, however, helps explain why the group has
expended such effort and shows that it is in radically better shape than
during the 1981-82 recession.
At the start of the last decade, the then Turner and Newall was the
country's largest producer of asbestos-related products. The legacy of
compensation claims has taken about 1 per cent of group sales each year,
with occasional extra shocks.
Turner and Newall's decline culminated in taxable losses of Pounds 19.3m in
1982 and the group was close to collapse. The Bank of England helped to
arrange a stay of execution and Sir Francis Tombs was installed as chairman.
Apart from completing a programme of cuts that saw the UK workforce fall
from 22,500 in 1979 to 10,500 in 1983, the business changed direction. The
dependence on asbestos was reduced, and automotive and industrial components
were built up.
Pre-tax profit reached a record level of Pounds 91m in 1988 on sales which
toped Pounds 1bn for the first time. But T&amp;N faltered before some of its
competitors. Although operating profit continued to grow in 1989 to Pounds
123m, a bulge in the asbestos-related liabilities and high interest costs
reduced the pre-tax figure to Pounds 84m.
Last year profits declined 16 per cent to Pounds 70.5m. Sharp falls were
registered on the continent as well as in the UK. The fall in operating
profit from automotive components, from Pounds 71.3m to Pounds 44.8m, was
partly offset by an improvement in engineering and industrial. The latter
division overtook motor, recording Pounds 61.8m of operating profits.
Those figures included the effect of Pounds 14m of redundancy costs and the
latest wave of job cuts, which will reduce the worldwide workforce to less
than 40,000, will cost another Pounds 7m.
Hope believes that the benefits of lower costs will coincide with an upturn
in demand later this year to revive pre-tax profit.
However, the benefits to shareholders when the recovery comes will be held
up by the extra shares in issue.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Serious Money): Why paranoia can pay
dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU DO not have to be paranoid to be a financial services consumer, but it
helps. Take the commissions versus fees debate, which may not cause too many
arguments in your local Dog &amp; Duck, but which can rouse tempers in the life
assurance industry.
A small company, Campbell Financial Services, has caused a stir by offering
a discount pensions service. Clients could ask the advice of a
commission-charging adviser but then switch to the Campbell service for
execution. They would be charged a fee of Pounds 199 but initial commission,
which could be as much as Pounds 1,000 for a long-term policy, would be
rebated.
The service was far from perfect - Campbell planned to keep any excess
commissions it earned and ethical questions were inevitably raised about the
likely poaching of clients. But it was in keeping with the Thatcherite
philosophy that competition, red in tooth and claw, can benefit consumers.
Vengeance came on Campbell from all directions. Its phone line was jammed
with obscene and threatening calls from competitors, leading to the
involvement of the police. There was a demand for a boycott of the company.
Then Fimbra suspended the group for lacking capital backing just over a week
ago. The investigation was unconnected with the recent controversy, said the
regulator. But after the bad publicity over the weekend, the company was
reinstated on Monday, having sorted out its problem.
Fimbra was probably only doing its job - and Campbell admits the service was
its main hope of pulling itself out of an unprofitable period. But it is not
necessary to believe that Campbell is entirely whiter than white to feel
slightly uneasy at the way it was treated.
Fees have many advantages for consumers, not the least of which is that they
ensure that the adviser and the client have a commonality of interest. An
adviser charging commission may be independent, but it is impossible for him
to be entirely disinterested.
Of course, journalists tend to be great enthusiasts for fees, an attitude
which causes advisers to smile at their naivety. Out trot the
counter-arguments in quick succession.
The public is not prepared to pay fees
This is probably because consumers do not know what they are paying. It is
easy to believe, when consulting your friendly adviser, that commission
comes out of some ill-defined insurance company 'pot' and not from your own
pocket. This is because the system of telling you what you fork out is
opaque. The regulatory body, the Securities and Investments Board, has
hardly been the consumer's champion in this respect.
The public will be driven into the arms of the tied agents, whose
commissions are much easier to hide
This argument is really a development of the first. It depends on consumers
being told as little as possible about the products they buy. If advisers
charge fees and recommend the policies of life companies with the lowest
expenses, they should be able to demonstrate value for money compared with
tied agents. As Eric Short pointed out in the last Weekend FT, life company
expenses are a vital component of investment return. Again, the regulators
(Lautro this time) have produced rules which tend to obfuscate rather than
elucidate the issues.
Why should commissions be revealed, when consumers are not told the mark-up
on a washing machine?
When you choose a washing machine, you know exactly what it is for - washing
clothes - and it is easy to compare its price and functions with other
models. A washing machine has a warranty if it goes wrong in the short term;
but it could be decades before you find out whether a life assurance policy
has performed well and you will then have little comeback. In any case, the
function of a financial services product is to give you a return on the
money you invest. The charges you pay are thus the very essence of the
product's worth.
Independent financial advisers will go out of business, under a fee-based
system.
One can see the appeal of this argument to an adviser, but not to a
consumer. It is certainly worth having independent financial advice but the
title IFA is a recent creation applied to people who were previously called
 -perish the thought - insurance salesmen.
Ten years ago, 'independent' financial advice was seen to come from
accountants, solicitors and, rightly or wrongly, bank managers. Many of the
last-named, now that banks are financial supermarkets, may no longer fit the
name. But why cannot consumers turn to accountants for advice? It is hard to
believe, with 200,000 UK accountants, that they cannot fill most of the
market niches.
All this is not to deny that many financial advisers are extremely
professional and try hard to give their clients a good service. It is just
that the system for selling financial services is flawed. It was set up to
suit the life insurance companies, not the consumer.
One of the most suspicious slogans of all is that 'life insurance must be
sold, not bought.' It can be used to cover a multitude of sins and it is
easy to insert the words 'double glazing' for life insurance without
changing the sense.
The system is changing slowly but be suspicious. Check how your adviser is
being paid and ask for commissions to be rebated. Paranoia can pay
dividends.

FT  04 MAY 91 / The Long View: Shares that defy the gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER YOU may think about the poor old British economy, the UK stock
market has been a distinctly more sprightly animal. In 1990 it has more or
less kept pace with the other major world markets despite the particular
intensity of the local recession. Its ability to generate high returns over
the years has been a indication that, in some respects at least, the British
corporate sector has performed quite strongly.
There is a reminder here from the new 1991 edition of Phillips &amp; Drew Fund
Managers' Pension Fund Indicators, which records that the average gross
annual return of 18.9 per cent on UK equities (dividend income plus capital
gains) during the ten years 1981-90 compares with 16.7 per cent on overseas
equities. A gap of little more than 2 percentage points may not sound much,
but it compounds to 25 per cent over a decade.
A rather more elaborate study of the long-term returns from four different
national stock markets has been produced by Paul Bostock and Paul Woolley of
the London investment boutique GMO Woolley. Published in the US Financial
Analysts Journal, it shows that in terms of fundamental value delivered to
investors British listed companies have indeed outperformed their rivals in
the US, Japan and Germany over any five-year or ten-year period within the
past twenty years. But currency and market valuation effects have sometimes
predominated, most notably in the Tokyo market.
Different local inflation rates, and volatile exchange rates, naturally make
it difficult to compare stock market returns. Bostock and Woolley have
broken down the overall returns into what they call a value-based measure,
taking in dividend income and real (inflation-adjusted) earnings growth,
together with two revaluation effects. The currency revaluation factor
(usually quite small over a long period) reflects exchange rate movements
over and above those required to maintain purchasing power parities; and the
market revaluation factor (sometimes quite large) reflects changes in the
market's average price-earnings ratio, an effect most dramatically seen in
Tokyo during the late 1980s when it was adding about 14 per cent each year
to the returns enjoyed by investors (though storing up a certain amount of
trouble for 1990, when Toyko crashed).
During the 20 years 1970-89 the UK delivered 7.8 per cent a year in terms of
combined income and real earnings growth, against about 5 per cent in each
of the other three markets. But the market revaluation effect pushed Japan
well ahead, to give an overall annual return of 22.8 per cent in dollars.
Even so, the UK return of 13.9 per cent was well ahead of the US figure of
10.6 per cent, and almost up with the 14.2 per cent return from German
equities.
Over the five years 1985-89 the UK again came top of the value measures,
largely because of the relatively high income (4.5 per cent compared with,
at the other extreme, 0.6 per cent in Japan). However, particularly powerful
revaluation factors sent both Japan and Germany well ahead on total return.
Still, London's return of 28.8 per cent at least trounced the 19.7 per cent
from Wall Street.
There are several curious features about all this. For example, there
appears to be no very close correlation between national economic growth and
corporate performance. True, Japan has consistently produced the fastest
economic growth and the best earnings growth (though not superior enough to
compensate for the meagre dividends). However, German corporate earnings
growth has been poor despite a generally good economic growth record, and
earnings growth has been worst of all in the US, even though its real annual
GDP growth rate has been a respectable 2.8 per cent over 20 years (against
2.5 per cent for the UK).
Secondly, the market revaluation effects have been inconsistent. You would
expect that investors would place a higher value on faster-growing earnings.
That indeed has happened in Japan, but it has also happened in recent years
in the US, where earnings growth has been particularly poor by international
standards. As for the UK, the much more buoyant corporate performance here
has been greeted by little or no price-earnings multiple expansion at all.
Is there no justice?
In the case of British companies they may indeed have been getting their
just deserts, because the quality of earnings has been deteriorating,
especially during the 1980s, because of lax accounting practices.
International investors have clearly become suspicious of the bottom line
obsessions of British managements. When UK company accounts are converted to
US standards, earnings typically take a dive.
The relationship of stock market performance to national growth is complex.
In Germany the narrowly-based stock market is unrepresentative of the
multitude of medium-sized, private companies which have made up the
economy's powerhouse. There is a much broader spread of listings in Japan,
but shareholders tend to come a long way down corporate priority lists:
hence the meagre dividend payments.
Anyway, the domicile of a company does not necessarily reflect with any
precision the geographical location of its activities. British listed
companies earn some 40 per cent of their profits from overseas subsidiaries,
and another 10 per cent or so from exports. If you extrapolate this process
to its limit, a country's framework of tax, law and markets may eventually
become more important to large companies than its economic success.
The case of the US is probably the oddest of all. Many of its major
companies have performed poorly over many years, and yet recently the
price-earnings multiples on Wall Street have expanded to levels which have
begun to frighten quite a few professional investors. It could be that the
market is saying something about the potential for corporate earnings
recovery after the recession, or just that investors are vainly seeking to
rediscover in stocks the value that has disappeared from the US bond market.
Maybe every dog has its day, but some should be kept on a short lead.

FT  04 MAY 91 / DM1bn project to clean up east German industrial area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PIONEERING agreement was announced in Germany yesterday between
government, industry and the Treuhand privatisation agency to clean up and
modernise one of the largest and most polluted industrial areas in east
Germany.
The operation, which could eventually cost at least DM1bn (Pounds 338m),
will focus on the region surrounding the Mansfeld metal conglomerate, near
Halle. It involves a partnership between Metallgesellschaft, the
Frankfurt-based metals, mining and engineering company, and US and European
concerns, and could provide a model for rehabilitation of other polluted
parts of Germany.
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, Metallgesellschaft's chief executive, said: 'The
programme should act as a signal for other such operations to be carried out
elsewhere in east Germany.' He has negotiated the agreement over the past
year with the Treuhand, owner of the Mansfeld concern, the government of the
state of Saxony-Anhalt, where it is based, and other German and
international companies.
Mansfeld, which mainly produces copper and aluminium, was one of east
Germany's biggest kombinats (industrial groups), employing 48,000. It now
has around 30,000 workers and its survival is in doubt because of heavy cost
and pollution problems.
For Metallgesellschaft and its partners, however, it would provide a
ready-made site for expansion at a time when approval of new sites in west
Germany can take years.
The agreement reached this week in Magdeburg, the state's capital, provides
for Metallgesellschaft to head a consortium to produce a feasibility study
for rehabilitation of the Mansfeld area. The next stages, once the study is
finished, involve cleaning the soil, modernising the smelters, installing a
new power plant and attracting new industry.
Metallgesellschaft has much experience of business in east Germany and
eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union. Its Lurgi engineering subsidiary
has developed soil decontamination technology which would be used in
Mansfeld.

FT  04 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong and New
Zealand extend gains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLOSURE of Tokyo yesterday for the second of its Golden Week holidays
did not restrain other Pacific Rim markets, which were more concerned with
domestic matters.
HONG KONG extended its gains in active trading following the previous day's
2.6 per cent surge, but it came off slightly in the final minutes of
trading. The Hang Seng index climbed 11.74 to 3,737.88, up 3.1 per cent on
the week. Turnover improved to HKDollars 1.82bn from HKDollars 1.72bn.
The index came off the day's high of 3,769 on rumours that Li Ka-Shing, the
Hong Kong investor, would issue a second batch of covered warrants on his
companies, Cheung Kong (Holdings) and Hutchison Whampoa.
NEW ZEALAND made its biggest gain in three months, which took the market to
its best level since October 2. The Barclays index closed 36.28 or 2.4 per
cent higher at 1,527.83, a rise of 3 per cent on the week. Turnover was
active at NZDollars 33m, up from NZDollars 19.6m.
The continuing rally in the bond market fuelled the gains, after news that
the current account deficit would be revised sharply downwards.
Fletcher Challenge rose 7 cents to NZDollars 4.10 on volume of 2.7m shares
and Brierley Investments gained 5 cents to NZDollars 1.10 on 4m shares.
AUSTRALIA slipped in quiet trading. The All Ordinaries index eased 2.1 to
1,517.8 - a fall on the week of 1.3 per cent - in turnover of ADollars 159m,
down from ADollars 197m.
Investors took profits in morning trading, while the firmer Australian
dollar depressed mining stocks. Foreigners stayed away after Thursday's
suspension of Adelaide Steamship and its associates, Tooth and Co and David
Jones, after they shelved their restructuring plans.
Pioneer International fell 6 cents to ADollars 2.50. On Wednesday, it
announced a placement of 70m new shares at ADollars 2.55 each to raise
ADollars 178.5m.
TAIWAN moved higher in thin trade, with the weighted index up 75.88 or 1.3
per cent at 5,852.95, but down 1.5 per cent on the week. Turnover fell to
TDollars 49.6bn from TDollars 59.1bn.
SEOUL fell slightly in spite of further moves by the government to prop up
the stock market. The composite index lost 3.17 to 649.10, up 2.3 per cent
on the week, in turnover of Won141.4bn, down from Won341.2bn.
The government announced an emergency measure yesterday, making about
Dollars 3bn worth of low interest loans to three local investment trust
firms that have suffered serious financial difficulties.
The loans would come from the government's surplus funds deposited at the
Bank of Korea. The three investment trust firms would be allowed to resume
stock purchases after clearing their debts with the new loans.
SINGAPORE fell in light trading. The Straits Times Industrial index lost
11.28 to 1,545.95, down 0.8 per cent on the week. Volume fell to 51m shares
from 67.5m. KUALA LUMPUR was also weak, although rises in index stocks
helped the composite index rise 0.89 to 588.09.
BANGKOK suffered a correction after its recent strength. The SET index fell
10.93 to 868.00, a decline of 0.5 per cent during the week. Turnover was
about 3.9bn baht.
JAKARTA remained under selling pressure, which brought the index down 4.74
to 407.48. Volume fell to 2.64m shares from 3.77m. MANILA drifted lower in
dull trading. The composite index shed 3.15 to 1,058.68, but rose 1 per cent
on the week. The turnover shrank to 98m pesos from 112m pesos.
BOMBAY recovered on prospects of a right-wing win in elections this month.
The BSE index rose 36.98 to 1,272.09.

FT  04 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Financials help bourses
achieve further modest advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST BOURSES achieved modest gains yesterday, as financial stocks continued
to attract buyers. But Amsterdam was depressed by a subdued London market,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was led higher for the second day by the banking sector, on hopes
that German interest rates could be on the way down. But the real-time DAX
index fell from a high of 1,636.80 to close just 1.80 up at 1,631.84, 0.5
per cent higher on the week and its best closing level since late August.
Volume eased to DM5.3bn from DM5.8bn.
Among banks, Dresdner put on DM7.50 to DM387.50 following favourable
recommendations from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, while Deutsche, which
is making a series of presentations to investors in the US, rose DM3.70 to
close at DM660.
Continental, the tyre manufacturer which is fending off a takeover bid from
Italy's Pirelli, fell Fl 1.30 to Fl 210.50. After the market closed,
Continental said it was halving its 1990 dividend and that its 1990 group
net profit had fallen to DM93.4m from DM228m. Although the 1990 results were
in line with an earlier company warning and with its defence document,
analysts feared that Continental was being too optimistic when it said that
profits would not fall further in 1991.
The car sector went against the trend. Volkswagen, due to present 1990
results on Tuesday, lost DM3.30 to DM371 while Daimler, due to report on May
15, fell DM3.80 to DM701.20.
MILAN rose across the board in moderately active trading, led by continued
buying of the insurer, Generali. The stock rose L760 or 2 per cent to
L37,600. The Comit index climbed 4.71 to 586,24, up 0.6 per cent on the
week, in volume estimated at around Thursday's L125bn.
Fiat rose as high as L5,280, although it was officially fixed L96 or 1.8 per
cent higher at L5,251 on hopes that the carmaker would maintain its dividend
on 1990 results. However, one analyst said he would not be surprised if Fiat
cut its 1990 dividend on ordinary shares to L200 from L370 to reflect the
company's deteriorating earnings, which he forecast would drop by 54 per
cent in 1990.
He noted that paying a steady dividend, including Treasury stock, would cost
Fiat 57 per cent of its 1990 net profits, compared with 25 per cent of net
profit the previous year. However, he added that while cutting the dividend
made sense from a business point of view, it was a difficult political
decision for Fiat to take as it would risk alienating the investment
community.
MADRID celebrated its return from a two-day holiday with a 1 per cent gain,
after the Spanish Treasury cut its 10-year bond yields. The general index
closed up 2.65 at 278.39, for a 0.6 per cent rise on the week. Turnover was
moderate at about Pta13bn.
Hidrola lost Pta9 to Pta571 and Iberduero eased Pta3 to Pta735 after the
electricity utilities confirmed their plans to merge late on Tuesday.
PARIS edged higher after Thursday's 2.5 per cent rise, with the CAC 40 index
adding another 8.08 to 1,832.31. Turnover, however, was thin. Over the week,
the bourse gained 3.2 per cent.
Recent brokers' reports have lifted Michelin and Suez during the week.
Yesterday Michelin gained another FFr1.10 to FFr96.20 and Suez, which
released results on Tuesday, rose FFr1.60 to FFr351.
AMSTERDAM was held back by the UK market, which was disappointed by the
Tories' performance in local elections and by a weak start on Wall Street
following jobless data. The CBS tendency index closed at 95.4, 0.8 down on
the day and little changed on the week.
Hoogovens, ex dividend of Fl 4.40, closed Fl 4.10 lower at Fl 59.10, while
Elsevier, ex dividend of Fl 2.10, was down Fl 1.90 at Fl 87.10.
ISTANBUL fell on profit-taking after two days of gains. The index fell
104.66 to 3,881.18, down 3.9 per cent on the week. ATHENS also declined, the
general index losing 28.65 to 1,143.58, for a fall on the week of 3.8 per
cent.

FT  04 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets: Scandinavian markets confound the
forecasters - The state of the Nordic economies has not been reflected in
share prices this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERFORMANCE of the Nordic region so far this year illustrates how stock
markets can prove to be unreliable indicators of a country's economic
health, and that short-term market forecasts are prone to error.
Back in January, stock exchange watchers believed that Oslo and Copenhagen
were set to do well early in 1991, while Stockholm and Helsinki would take
longer to recover from their setbacks last year.
The opposite has proved to be the case. This year, according to the
FT-Actuaries World Indices, Stockholm has enjoyed one of the most impressive
rallies anywhere, with its 23 per cent rise in local currency terms beaten
only by Madrid in Europe, while Helsinki has been not far behind with 20 per
cent growth.
By contrast, Oslo languishes at the bottom of the FT-A index for Europe with
only a 5 per cent increase so far this year, while Copenhagen, at 14.5 per
cent, is below the European average of 16.4 per cent.
Swedish analysts have been hard pressed to explain what has spurred
Stockholm on, after it suffered the biggest fall in share values in its
history in 1990. In the first quarter of this year, the bourse was the
world's best performer in local currency terms and the second best after
Hong Kong in US dollars.
It was not just the persistently gloomy macroeconomic indicators this year
that made the upsurge hard to decipher, but also the steady stream of
pessimistic annual results from most of Sweden's listed blue-chip companies,
particularly Volvo, Saab-Scania, Electrolux and SKF. Combined profits of
Sweden's 500 largest companies, adjusted for inflation, fell 20 per cent
last year.
Some of the shine has been taken off Stockholm in the past fortnight but, as
the business magazine Affarsvarlden argued last week, 'the stock market does
not seem to know which way to turn, so it goes both ways'.
The magazine could find no obvious explanation for the first quarter boom,
coming up with the view: 'Possibly, investors wanted to simply forget 1991
and start banking on a strong recovery in 1992.'
There has been a growing interest among foreign investors in Swedish shares
this year, in particular for Astra, the pharmaceutical company, and the
engineering groups Atlas Copco and Asea. Today foreigners own around SKr40bn
(Dollars 6.5bn) worth of Swedish shares, 6 per cent of the total market
capitalisation.
This positive attitude reflects confidence outside Sweden that the country
is heading in a sensible economic direction. The government's decision to
seek membership of the European Community, a tight financial policy that
shows no signs of relaxation in spite of a general election in September,
and a fall in interest rates appear to have convinced international opinion
that Sweden has a strong future.
Helsinki, like Stockholm, had a terrible year in 1990. It was the world's
second worst performer after Tokyo, with a 34.8 per cent fall in the Unitas
index. But in February it began to recover at a dramatic rate. In the view
of Kleinwort Benson Securities, 'bored by bad news and full of cash,
investors on the Helsinki bourse decided to stop worrying about 1991 and to
love 1992, or even 1993'.
The uncertainties over the Finnish economy, which is in its worst recession
since the mid-1970s, coupled with last week's arrival of a new
Centre-Conservative coalition government, must put a question mark over
Helsinki's ability to improve further. Investors seem to have been
reassured, however, that the currency is not about to be devalued, contrary
to earlier fears. The stock market recovery has been led by international
investors, while their domestic counterparts have been cautious about
following suit.
This week's announcement by the Swedish companies, Volvo and Aga, that they
are cancelling their Helsinki listings because of the high fees - said to be
the highest in the world - is bound to cause concern. The fees were
increased at the start of 1991 to compensate for low trading volumes.
While analysts remain sceptical about the extent of the recoveries in
Stockholm and Helsinki, they remain convinced that there will be
improvements on the other Nordic stock markets.
Copenhagen has not done as well as might have been expected. The Danish
economy is in better shape than the other Nordic countries, with the lowest
inflation rate in Europe and improving trade and current account surpluses.
However, this has not impressed the bourse. The bond market has been much
more favourable, producing an average real yield of 6 per cent. With a cut
in corporate tax rates to 38 per cent this year and average wage costs only
rising by 3.5 per cent, it is hard to understand why the equity market has
been so lacklustre.
'Copenhagen is a very defensive market,' explains Ms Birgitte Kjolhede at
Kleinwort Benson Securities. 'There is a lack of interest in most
medium-sized companies at the moment.'
Oslo is also disappointing. The Norwegian economy has been improving, with a
strong currency, low inflation helped by a modest wage round, and a solid
current account. But once again this has not done much to cheer up the stock
market, where trading volume has been sluggish.
Shipping shares staged a comeback, with a 15.5 per cent improvement in
January and February, but there is still a long way to go to recover the
levels of early 1990. The banks have also been strong, in spite of their
financial troubles, thanks to the government's new risk capital fund and the
liberalising of the capital requirement rules.
But the recently announced corporate tax reforms have unsettled the market,
while Norsk Hydro, accounting for 30 per cent of the bourse, saw a fall in
profits for the first quarter of 1991, which has also caused some concern.
It is possible that the early prognoses for 1991 will be more accurate for
the rest of the year. There is still time for Stockholm and Helsinki to sink
again, and for Oslo and Copenhagen to advance, although it is doubtful
whether the explanations offered at that time will be any more convincing.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Commodities (Week in the markets): Base metals retreat as
stocks rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WAREHOUSE STOCKS in all the base metals traded on the London Metal Exchange
rose yesterday. Zinc stocks stand at a record high, while aluminium, lead
and copper stocks are at or near the highest levels for many years.
Mr Robin Bhar, of Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, the London brokers, said: 'Demand is
weak, so people deliver surplus metal to the LME - it's as simple as that.'
The weight of stocks is reflected in the prices, which are down across the
board this week - except for cash copper, which has been held up by a
technical squeeze.
The squeeze on copper can be seen in the widening premium for cash metal
over three month metal this week. On Thursday the premium closed at Pounds
81.50 a tonne, but narrowed yesterday to Pounds 73 as cash metal retreated
to close at Pounds 1,467.50 a tonne, a fall of Pounds 14.50 on the day but
up Pounds 3 on the week.
Mr Nick Moore, metals analyst with Ord Minnett, believes the copper price is
a 'myth defying reality. At some stage people have got to realise the
emperor has no clothes.'
Copper stocks yesterday rose by 5,800 tonnes to 237,875 tonnes, the highest
level since May 1984, as the high prices attracted metal into LME
warehouses. This is almost a third more than the amount of stocks at the
beginning of the year, and yet the price is more or less unchanged since
then, Mr Moore points out.
The cash price has been held up by position covering by producers and some
investment funds that have sold short of copper. Additional support was
given on Thursday by a declaration of force majeure from Gecamines, the
Zairean state-owned copper producer, on 45 per cent of its commitments this
year.
Zinc stocks reached a record 115,275 tonnes, sparking commission house
selling and depressing prices yesterday. Overnight news of a tentative
agreement that might end the long-running dispute at Brunswick Mining's
Bathurst lead and zinc mines also weighed on the market. Cash zinc closed at
Dollars 1,134 a tonne, a fall of Dollars 14.50 on the week.
Mr Bhar points out that zinc production is strongly up this year; there have
been no strikes in Peru and little industrial unrest elsewhere in the world.
At the same time demand is weak.
Aluminium stocks - at 363,725 tonnes - are close to eight-year highs, also
at a time of high production figures, says Mr Bhar.
The rise in tin stocks, following a steady pattern of small declines, put
further pressure on the market yesterday. Prices fell every day this week,
leaving cash tin at Dollars 5,632.50 a tonne, a fall of Dollars 192.50 on
the week.
The sugar market, which fell steeply to the lowest levels for more than
three years at the beginning of the week, was making a gradual recovery
until it was confronted yesterday with a sharply higher estimate of the
world surplus for this year.
ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house, estimates that production for 1990-91
will exceed demand by 4.6m tonnes, the biggest surplus since 1982-83. 'It's
a huge surplus and I can't see any hope for the market with that sort of
situation,' one despondent dealer said yesterday.
Man's latest figure compares with its previous estimate, made in January, of
a 1.9m tonne surplus. In February FO Licht, the German statistician, put the
surplus at 3.33m tonnes. Czarnikow, another large trade house, is expected
to rise its estimate upwards from 1.2m tonnes later this month.
On Tuesday the London Daily Price for raw sugar was Dollars 194 a tonne, the
lowest level since November 1987. Yesterday it was Dollars 195.50 a tonne, a
fall of Dollars 13.50 on the week.
Man now puts this season's production at 113.8m tonnes, compared with its
previous estimate of 110.4m tonnes. It points out that this is the largest
rise in output since 1981-82.
'Although sporadic short term rallies cannot be discounted  ...the weight of
the existing as well as the impending supply surpluses should depress
values, forcing prices to drift lower,' Man says.
Coffee prices have been flat, with the market keeping one ear cocked for any
news from the International Coffee Organisation's executive board meeting.
However the meeting, which ended yesterday, threw no new light on the stance
of Brazil, the world's biggest producer, towards a revival of the export
quota system.

FT  04 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Water shares unsettled
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealers in water company shares took defensive action at the start of
trading after the poor showing by the Conservative Party in local elections.
Waters are the only sector the opposition Labour Party has said it would
take back into public ownership if it regained power at the next general
election.
Shares were marked down by around 5p but little selling ensued and prices
mostly rallied to show small gains at one point. They slipped again towards
the close.
Several features emerged in the sector, which was hit late on Thursday by
the unravelling of a number of Water Packages. The proceeds of the
unravelling were reinvested in the water stocks represented in the Footsie
index. North West was one rose well to close 2 1/2 higher at 307 1/2 p,
having been cut to 300p at the outset. Turnover was 5.2m.
The Water Package retreated to Pounds 2968 early in the session but picked
up to close only 28 off at Pounds 3040.
Mr Steve Doe at Smith New Court said the market had been disappointed at the
outcome of the elections but said the sector was now a 'solid hold'. Other
analysts said they expected the shares to at least track the market ahead of
the flotation of the Scottish power generators. It was pointed out, however,
that many more of the remaining water package units would be broken up ahead
of July 12 when dealings in the unit cease; 'Big funds will continue to
focus on the easily tradeable Footsie-type stocks,' said an analyst.
Bid stories revived
The dearth of new takeover speculation found traders seeking to revive old
stories. They focused on the one that Smiths Industries would attempt either
to effect a friendly merger or, if this failed, use its large cash resources
to acquire Dowty, the aerospace components group. The two groups already
have trading links through a joint venture.
The basis for the story was supposed stakebuilding by one investment house.
A week ago yesterday S G Warburg bid persistently for stock, but rival
marketmakers doubted whether the quantities were sufficient to invoke the
Companies Act requirement regarding the disclosure of a shareholding in
excess of 3 per cent.
Analysts dismissed the possibility of a bid, saying the speculation was
bound to happen sometime with Smiths sitting on cash and Dowty struggling.
Dowty shares rose 6 to 190p on light turnover of 1.1m while Smiths remained
at 269p.
Tomkins benefits
Conglomerate Tomkins reached towards a year's high, benefiting from both
overseas and domestic influences. The recent strength of the dollar was
foremost, since 70 per cent of group profits are derived from the US
following integration of the Philips Industries acquisition. Also, the US
economy seems to be moving out of recession more quickly than the UK.
Tomkins has held talks recently with institutional investors, and some
traders feel these might have been soundings for a possible UK acquisition.
Analysts believe such a purchase is necessary to redress the current high
exposure to North American sales. Tomkins closed a penny better at 332p,
just a few pence off the 1991 peak.
The recent switching in the bank issues, out of Lloyds and into NatWest, was
reversed. Lloyds picked up strongly to close 8 higher at 345p on 4m. NatWest
ran back 10 to 330p after news of the US preference share issue.
A seller of Standard Chartered depressed the stock 7 to 384p. Kleinwort
Benson edged up 6 to 330p.
A County NatWest sell note left Sedgwick 5 lower at 248p. CE Heath, hit
recently by a bearish note from BZW, dropped 10 more to 498p.
Confirmation of the boardroom reshuffle - the chairman and chief executive
will retire in July, a year earlier than planned - deflated Allied-Lyons. At
the close the stock was 9 down at 552p, but up 32 on the week owing to
takeover speculation.
Concern that Allied Colloids would not be able to match last year's profits
of Pounds 41.3m left the shares down 19 at 140p. Analysts have lowered their
sights and now expect the company to reveal annual profits, when its reports
on June 7, of around Pounds 37.5m. Smith New Court has long been on the sell
tack, believing that the premium rating of the stock was not justified.
Burton was unchanged at 96p on 5.3m and was supported by reports that it is
close to selling Harvey Nichols, the department store, for Pounds 60m.
According to the report,Burton had been hoping for Pounds 100-120m. Analysts
said Pounds 60m for Harvey Nichols would be earnings enhancing for Burton
and should lift the shares. However, Burton denied that it had clinched the
sale of the store.
Ratners rose 3 1/2 to 169p on a recommendation from Hoare Govett, which said
the shares were underrated. Mr Bill Currie of Hoare said: 'The worries about
Mr Gerald Ratner's recent comments about the quality of his goods are
overdone. Consumers will soon have forgotten about them.'
Kwik Save rose 7 to 599p as Panmure Gordon recommended the stock on the
basis of its strong earnings potential and the conservative treatment of its
accounts. Investors were advised to switch out of Tesco, down a penny at
295p and Asda, off 1 1/2 at 121p.
Talk of an equity issue by Cadbury Schweppes refused to die and the shares
fell 7 to 376p. Speculation about a convertible bond issue to fund an
overseas bid, possibly Dr Pepper/7-Up of the US, was once again mentioned.
While not ruling out an equity issue at some stage, most analysts remained
sceptical about the likelihood of an immediate issue.
Torday &amp; Carlisle, the specialist engineering company, continued to give
ground. It warned on Tuesday that interim profits would fall short of last
year's. The order book at Oldham Signs has fallen off during the first
quarter and there is little indication of an early improvement, said a
researcher. The shares closed 3 easier for a loss on the week of 37 to 117p.
Industrial materials group Morgan Crucible recovered further to 238p, up 9,
on a buy recommendation combined with hints of the rights issue having been
a success.
Kalon, the Yorkshire paint maker, recorded exceptionally heavy turnover as
Smith New Court placed 21m shares with a range of institutional investors.
The shares, 17.6 per cent of the equity capital, were sold by interests of
the Silver family, long-standing large shareholders, to lengthen the
shareholders list. Double counting of the deal boosted turnover in the
stock, slightly easier at 57p, to 44m shares.
Ocean Group rose 3 to 356p as the 4.1m rump of the recent Pounds 88m rights
issue was placed at 348p.
Brent Walker, which has come under periodic bouts of selling pressure as the
market has focused on the group's heavy debts, were hit hard first thing.
The shares dropped to 48p at one point, before rallying to close a net 6 off
at 53p; turnover totalled 1m.
There were suggestions in the market that Brent Walker might be considering
a a straightforward sale of its William Hill bookmaking chain, or a possible
stock market flotation of the division, which it bought from Grant
Metropolitan a couple of years ago for a bank-financed Pounds 560m.
Norman Hay recovered more strongly, closing 5 higher at 36p on news that the
shareholding held by T E Brown had risen to 5 per cent.
Dauphin, the office equipment company, progressed to a 1991 high of 115p, up
7. According to County NatWest, the company is well managed and has a strong
balance sheet.

FT  04 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DOUBTS crept into stock index futures yesterday as the larger-than-expected
swing against the Conservative party at Thursday's local elections forced
the market onto the defensive.
By the close the June FT-SE 100 index contract was down 14 points at 2,538,
while its premium to the spot index had been whittled away to just 15 points
against 22 in the previous session.
With fair value, brokers' estimate of the futures market's theoretical
premium, also at 15 points, the futures market is now indicating that the
stock market is unlikely to rise much further.
However, in the traded options market a number of bullish trades indicated
that there are still investors who anticipate further immediate gains, in
spite of the less certain political climate.
In the FT-SE 100 index options, there were buyers of July 2,650 calls and
sellers of August 2,450 puts. There were also sellers of May 2,250 calls and
buyers of May 2,400 calls.
The recent lowering of brokers profits forecasts in Asda prompted selling of
October 110 puts. A total of 1,151 contracts changed hands, equivalent to
1.1m shares, which made it the busiest stock option.
Bid speculation in Allied-Lyons lifted turnover, with the October 600 calls
particularly active.

FT  04 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Shares drift ahead of long weekend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON SHARES drifted lower in quiet trading as investors and marketmakers
avoided risks ahead of the holiday weekend.
The mood was subdued as the market acknowledged that the local elections
results were discomforting for the Conservative Party.
A modest overnight rise in New York inspired no one. On the opening of the
new session, Wall Street lost ground as US employment figures indicated
there was little pressure for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates
further in the short term.
UK equity strategists varied from the cautious to the pessimistic. Mr John
Reynolds County NatWest argued that since the swing away from the
Conservatives was only partly towards the opposition Labour Party, the
disappointment of the results was cushioned. He pointed to a limited fall in
the share prices and sterling's resilience as evidence: 'there is scope for
one per cent off interest rates over the next few months,' he said. A half
percentage point is already discounted in the money markets.
Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull had a different interpretation of the
polls. He said that the results had been 'the worst possible' for the
market. Support for the centrist Liberal Democrats raised the prospect of a
hung parliament and associated uncertainties.
He also thought that the Conservative government would have to wait until
1992 before calling an election - unemployment would be rising too quickly
in the autumn. There were dangers, too, of political interest rates cuts
that would reap only small electoral benefits.
Mr Harnett added that the danger period for shares was the next few days of
trading. If the market survived next week at current levels it could then
rise quickly. Chartists elsewhere agreed, saying that although the
fundamentals were negative, the market was 'behaving as if it had upside
potential'.
Faced with such diversity, investors did little. The Footsie index spent the
entire day just inside negative territory. There was little trade to
persuade marketmakers to change their prices and the index moved in a narrow
range before ending 1.9 above the day's low at 2522.7. The net fall was 8
and turnover an unspectacular 452.7m shares.
The dollar's late recovery, gaining more than two cents against sterling,
helped international stocks. Wellcome again the among the best performers as
upbeat press and analysts' comment followed the Thursda's results.
Gilts opened a little easier on worries that sterling could weaken after the
polls. They soon rallied only to lose ground when US bonds fell on the US
employment figures. Gilts ended up to  1/4 point off.
Caution ahead of local polls meant low volume. Bid talk helped levels on
Thursday, but funds were disinclined to commit much cash ahead of next set
of inflation data.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Money Markets: Bank lends at 12%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES WERE little changed on the London money market yesterday, but for the
fourth Friday running the Bank of England signalled that another cut in UK
bank base rates would not be welcomed at present. The central bank has sent
the same warning on each Friday, including when rates were last reduced on
April 12.
There was no strong reaction to news of large losses by the Conservative
Party in Thursday's local government elections. Three-month sterling
interbank was unchanged at June short sterling futures opened lower at 88.82
on Liffe, and fell to 88.78 at the close from 88.84.
Day-to-day credit was in very short supply on the cash market, and the Bank
of England indicated its wish for caution on interest rates by not supplying
enough help to take out the full underlying shortage and by inviting the
discount houses to use their borrowing facilities after lunch.
A shortage of Pounds 1,600m was initially forecast, but this was revised to
Pounds 1,650m at noon and back to Pounds 1,600m in the afternoon. Total
assistance of Pounds 1,456m was provided.
An early round of help was offered and at that time the authorities bought
Pounds 496m bills outright, by way of Pounds 1m Treasury bills in band 1 at
11 7/8 per cent; Pounds 4m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent; Pounds
1m Treasury bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent; and Pounds 490m bank bills

Before lunch another Pounds 485m bills were purchased, via Pounds 65m
Treasury bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent; Pounds 268m bank bills in band
1 at 11 7/8 per cent; and Pounds 152m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per
cent.
The authorities did not offer to buy bills in the afternoon, but lent Pounds
475m to the discount houses for seven days, at the existing base rate of 12
per cent.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 1,713m, with a rise in the note circulation
absorbing Pounds 525 and bank balances below target Pounds 130m. These
outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 770m to liquidity.
At the weekly Treasury bill tender the average rate of discount on 91-day
bills fell to 10.9612 from 11.1700 per cent and the average on 182-day bills
declined to 10.5408 from 10.7243 per cent.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Employment data boost dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR rose yesterday on news of stronger than expected April US
employment data. A surprising fall to 6.6 from 6.8 per cent in the
unemployment rate and a smaller than forecast fall of 124,000 in non-farm
payrolls, against a revised drop of 241,000 in March, led to demand for the
US currency.
Analysts were looking for a rise to 7.0 per cent in the unemployment rate
and for a fall of about 170,000 in the payrolls figure. The better data were
regarded as possibly the first concrete sign that the US economy is moving
out of recession.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, a White House spokesman, said it was welcome news, but
he was cautious whether the figures signalled an end to the recession. A
commissioner for the US Bureau of Labor Statistics warned that the
unemployment rate probably exaggerated the improvement.
This caution in official circles pulled the dollar back from peaks of
DM1.7540 and Y138.90, but it still finished much firmer on the day in
London. The currency rose to DM1.7460 from DM1.7240; to Y138.50 from
Y138.05; to SFr1.4750 from Y1.4590; and to FFr5.9150 from FFr5.8325. On Bank
of England figures the dollar's index climbed to 66.6 from 66.2.
The improvement by the dollar was mainly at the expense of the D-Mark, with
the German currency weakening in cross rate trading, particularly against
the Japanese yen. It finished in London at Y79.30 compared with Y80.05
previously.
Figures from the European Commission showed the D-Mark around the middle of
the European exchange rate mechanism, but later in the day unofficial
figures put the German unit second weakest, just above the French franc. The
French currency hit its floor against the top placed Spanish peseta.
Sterling remained fourth strongest in the ERM, on data from the European
Commission, with the pound holding relatively steady despite heavy losses
for Britain's ruling Conservative Party in Thursday's local government
elections.
These results appear to rule out a UK general election as early as June and
have therefore temporarily reduced any political risk in holding sterling.
Dealers believe they may have also delayed further cuts in UK bank base
rates. The Bank of England endorsed the present rate structure in its
operations on the London money market yesterday.
At the London close the pound had fallen 2.15 cents to Dollars 1.6950 while
declining to Y234.75 from Y237.00 and to SFr2.5000 from SFr2.5050, but was
unchanged at DM2.9600 and rose to FFr10.0250 from FFr10.0125. Sterling's
index fell 0.2 to 91.2.

FT  04 MAY 91 / International Company News: Michelin to keep control in the
family tradition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS of Michelin, the world's largest tyre company, have been asked
to approve the 28-year-old son of Mr Francois Michelin, the current
chairman, as his possible successor.
Mr Michelin, 64, and his two fellow managing partners have put forward Mr
Edouard Michelin, currently working in the commercial division, as a future
managing partner, paving the way for him eventually to take full charge.
The older partners will continue to be in charge at Michelin 'for many years
to come', before handing down full responsibility, says a letter to
shareholders. This is the best way to ensure management continuity, says the
letter.
If shareholders accept the proposal at a meeting on June 28, the younger Mr
Michelin would replace 75-year-old Mr Francois Rollier, the oldest of the
three managing partners, who is due to retire then. The remaining managing
partner is Mr Rene Zingraff, 54, who has worked in the same position since
1966 with Mr Michelin senior, grandson of the company's founder.
The move is the latest example of how several French companies have held on
to the tradition of keeping control in the hands of founding families.
The top jobs in companies like Bouygues in construction, Dassault in
aviation, Pernod Ricard in drinks and Gallimard in publishing have passed to
descendants of the founder in recent years, while father-to-son transitions
of power are under way at Matra in electronics and Club Mediterranee, the
holiday village group.
Edouard, the chairman's fourth son, is around the same age his predecessors
were when they became managing partners and is about to take responsibility
for the group's US and Canadian businesses.
He will report to Mr Carlos Ghosn, the current manager of Michelin's North
American interests, including Uniroyal Goodrich, the US tyre maker acquired
last year.
Mr Edouard Michelin has followed a standard education for the French
business elite, having trained at the Ecole Centrale in Paris, one of the
so-called Grandes Ecoles public service colleges.
He undertook military service on a nuclear submarine before taking on a
series of posts in group plants.
He has the attributes 'that the future head of a company like ours must
have', says the partners' letter to shareholders.

Dollars 3bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL AIRLINES, one of the five largest US carriers, is seeking more
than Dollars 3bn in fresh equity and cash to restructure its debt-burdened
balance-sheet and help it out of bankruptcy in the next eight to 12 months.
Mr Hollis Harris, the new chairman of the airline which filed for protection
from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code last December,
said he was seeking the conversion of about Dollars 2bn of unsecured debt
into equity.
The airline currently has total unsecured debts of Dollars 2.5bn and secured
debts of Dollars 4.5bn.
Mr Harris, the former Delta Airlines president brought in to rescue
Continental, said it was planning to raise an additional Dollars 600m in new
equity from three or four investor groups.
The company has had discussions with business representatives at its three
US hubs of Houston, Denver and Newark, New Jersey.
At the same time, Continental is in advanced talks to sell a controlling
interest in its Air Micronesia operation in the Pacific for about Dollars
300m. But Mr Harris emphasised Continental would continue to be closely
involved in the operation in which it intended to retain a 49 per cent
interest.
The airline is also expecting to raise about Dollars 80m this year from the
sale of its Chelsea air catering company. It has already sold its Seattle to
Tokyo route to American Airlines for Dollars 150m.
All these transactions coupled with the restructuring of the company
aircraft operating and capital leases are designed to reconstruct the
company's balance sheet and provide additional capital to expand the
airline.
Mr Harris stressed that Continental had to find a way not to shrink its
operations. The airline has 350 aircraft in its fleet and has 190 new Boeing
and Airbus jets on order.
'We must grow the airline as we come out of Chapter 11 (protection). We
cannot cut back. We have to grow and maintain market share if we are to
compete with the other big carriers,' he said.
But he acknowledged that the financial restructuring if successful was
likely to dilute significantly current shareholders' equity. This would
include Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) which currently owns 16.8 per
cent of Continental shares and 18.3 per cent of voting rights.
'Their holding will automatically be reduced significantly under the
restructuring,' Mr Harris said. But he added that he expected SAS to invest
additional funds in Continental. 'We have a good relationship and I believe
they want to be a partner with us,' Mr Harris said.
Continental reported this week a sizeable first-quarter loss of Dollars
194.8m compared with a Dollars 21.3m profit in the same quarter last year.

SOURCE Perrier, the French mineral water and cheese group, managed a sharp
recovery in reported profits last year.
The group, which had to withdraw its entire world stocks of Perrier water
following the discovery of benzene traces early last year, saw net
attributable profits rise by a provisional 30.6 per cent to FFr347m (Dollars
61m) in 1990 from FFr266m in the previous year.
Perrier gave no other details of the group's results in an accounting report
for its holding company.
However, it pointed out that Source Perrier took a FFr1bn exceptional charge
in its 1989 accounts for the cost of repurchasing and destroying stocks.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MANPOWER, the employment group which eventually resulted from the merger of
the UK's Blue Arrow group and Manpower of the US, yesterday reported a steep
decline in first-quarter profits.
Blaming the general recessionary climate on both sides of the Atlantic, the
Milwaukee-based group made Dollars 18,000 after tax in the first three
months, excluding any goodwill amortisation.
This compared with an Dollars 8.69m profit in the same period a year
earlier.
Revenues in the period amounted to Dollars 681.3m, against Dollars 669.3m.
The company had already warned that, after a fairly sharp earnings tumble in
1990, it would break even or even possibly show a small loss in the first
quarter.
It did not provide a detailed break-down of the figures, but said that the
Manpower International subsidiary contributed profits of Dollars 7.96m,
against Dollars 23.4m last time.
Mr Mitchell Fromstein, chairman, noted that the first quarter is usually
light in terms of revenues and profits, and claimed that revenues had held
up relatively well, at least preserving the group's market share.
The company is currently redomiciling to the US, from Britain.
Yesterday, its shares, listed in ADR form, eased  1/8 to Dollars 12.

<TEXT>
PLACER Dome, one of North America's leading gold producers, suffered halved
first-quarter income, with lower prices, higher costs and slack base metal
sales more than offsetting a 5 per cent rise in bullion output.
The Vancouver-based company reported net earnings of CDollars 17.6m
(USDollars 15m), or 7 cents a share, down from CDollars 35.1m, or 15 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenues fell to CDollars 256.8m from CDollars
299.9m.
Gold earnings tumbled to CDollars 10.6m from CDollars 25.9m. The company's
share of production rose to 357,000 oz from 337,000 oz, thanks to the
contribution of the new Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea, which produced a
total of 224,800 oz in the quarter.
But the realised gold price of USDollars 410 per oz was 6 per cent lower
than a year earlier, and total production costs advanced to an average of
USDollars 336 from USDollars 321 per oz. Cash costs were up 27 per cent.
The higher costs were ascribed to lower output at the Campbell Mine in
northern Ontario, the Misima mine in Papua New Guinea and the Kidston
property in Australia.
Earnings from other metals, notably copper, silver and molybdenum were
CDollars 1.5m, down from CDollars 7.2m. Placer said hedging will ensure it
receives at least USDollars 435 an oz for 61 per cent of its 1991 gold
output.
A study on the Mount Milligan property in British Columbia should be
completed this summer. Preliminary studies point to a mine with a capital
cost of CDollars 440m, which could produce 280,000 oz of gold and 80m lbs of
copper a year.

FT  04 MAY 91 / International Company News: Lafayette to bid for French
rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GALERIES Lafayette, the Parisian department store group, has been forced
against its intentions to launch a takeover bid for rival retailer,
Nouvelles Galeries.
The offer values Nouvelles Galeries at FFr5.4bn (Dollars 964m).
The French stock exchange council ordered Galeries Lafayette to bid for
control after the stores group had spent FFr800m lifting its existing stake
in Nouvelles Galeries, with apparently friendly intentions.
Galeries Lafayette last week bought a 16.4 per cent block of Nouvelles
Galeries shares from Proventus, the Swedish retailing group, so lifting its
stake in Nouvelles Galeries to 39 per cent.
The buyer unsuccessfully sought an exemption from French takeover laws,
under which it had to make an automatic offer for two thirds of Nouvelles
Galeries' capital on passing the 33 per cent threshold.
The stock exchange council refused to accept Galeries Lafayette's argument
that the fact that 47.5 per cent of Nouvelles Galeries' voting rights are
held by the controlling Devanlay textiles group exempted it from the
obligation to launch a full bid.
If Mr Leon Cligman, Devanlay's chairman and his family shareholders now
accept Galeries Lafayette's bid, securities analysts believe this could
start off a wide and overdue reshuffle of ownership in the French retail
sector.
The winner of any such contest would be under clear pressure to finance the
acquisition by selling Nouvelles Galeries' 51 per cent ownership of BHV, the
French chain of home improvements stores.
Galeries Lafayette has offered FFr863.5 per share for the 1,560,039 extra
shares needed to control two thirds of Nouvelles Galeries' capital, which
would cost it FFr1.34bn if fully accepted.

CONTINENTAL, the German tyre manufacturer, proposes to halve its dividend to
DM4 for 1990 following a sharp drop in earnings occasioned by the dismal
state of the world tyre market.
Net profits fell to DM93.4m (Dollars 56m) last year, after DM227.8m in 1989.
The earnings setback had been accurately foreshadowed in the defence
document Continental drew up at the end of last year in the course of its
attempts to ward off advances from Pirelli of Italy.
Arguing for its independence and against Pirelli's merger proposals
Continental pointed out that it was still making money - even if largely in
the non-tyre activities gathered into ContiTech.
The Pirelli group, which accounts in guilders, suffered a loss of Fl 9.3m
(Dollars 4.94m) loss for 1990, with no dividend being paid for the per-iod.
Group turnover edged up 2 per cent to DM8.55bn, while other details of the
1990 performance await the annual press conference on May 14.
In February, Mr Ignolf Knaup, the finance director, forecast an improvement
in the current year, with turnover rising to around DM9.5bn, helped both by
acquisitions and by internal growth.
Net profits should reach around DM100m for 1991, according to Mr Knaup.

FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Scottish TV edges ahead helped by rise in
programme sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INCREASE of more than 40 per cent in programme sales was the main factor
allowing pre-tax profits at Scottish Television, the independent television
contractor for central Scotland, to edge up from Pounds 11.11m to Pounds
11.23m in 1990.
Sir Campbell Fraser, chairman, said that 'within the context of a testing
year', the company performed well in every area of its activities.
The results come just days before the deadline on May 15 for companies to
submit bids to the independent television commission for the new ITV
franchises.
Sir Campbell said the company was putting the final touches to its
application for central Scotland. If reappointed, he was looking forward to
'a return to better days' in 1992.
He noted that, among other attributes, the company had a strong balance
sheet, improving share of advertising revenue, increasing programme sales
and costs under tight control.
Advertising revenues were up only 2 per cent at Pounds 89.05m (Pounds
87.32m), but Sir Campbell said ITV as a whole stood still. By contrast
programme sales and services rose strongly to Pounds 18.24m (Pounds 12.91m).
Total turnover was Pounds 114.08m (Pounds 103.78m).
The pre-tax line was, however, depressed by a rise in the Exchequer levy to
Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 4.04m): 'not the first time', Sir Campbell noted, that
the charge had been increased at a time of difficulties for the industry.
However, compared with the previous year, profits were helped by charges of
only Pounds 558,000 (Pounds 3.15m) for voluntary early leavers and
retirements and reorganisation.
The final dividend is lifted to 23p (20p) for a total of 28.75p (25p).
Earnings per share were 62p (61p).

FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Institutions launch bid to oust Tace board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWICH UNION and Framlington Group have launched a bid to remove the entire
board of Tace, the environmental monitoring company, and to reinstate as
chairman Mr Michael Beckett, who resigned from Tace a week ago, writes
Richard Gourlay.
In a letter to fellow shareholders, Norwich Union said it had called for an
extraordinary general meeting because it had lost confidence in the current
board under the chairmanship of Sir David Nicolson.
Norwich Union controls 5 per cent and Framlington 16 per cent of Tace, but
institutions accounting for about 40 per cent are understood to back the
shareholder revolt.
However, shareholders who control about 29 per cent of the Tace stock have
given 'indications' that they will vote against Norwich Union's proposals,
according to Mr David Floyd, of Belmont Bank which is acting as adviser to
Tace.
These shareholders are Mr Jock Mackenzie, the founder who resigned as
chairman last year under strong institutional pressure but still controls 23
per cent of the stock, and Mr Bob Morton, the City financier, who controls
4.4 per cent, through Southwind.
Sir David, who is 69 and a former chairman of British Airways and BTR,
became Tace chairman in March against the wishes of the institutional
shareholders who preferred Mr Beckett.
Norwich Union said it had discussed the need for an independent audit ahead
of a financial restructuring and rights issue.
Sir David has said he thought an audit was unnecessary and last week hastily
announced the restructuring plan which involved Tace buying the 49 per cent
of Goring Kerr, another environmental monitoring group, that it did not
already control.
The institutions have been angered by the head office expenses which Tace
has incurred since 1988 and the level of directors' remuneration.
They remained sceptical that the board under Sir David would be able to
control these costs and that he had a strong business development plan for
the company.
Mr Mackenzie received remuneration of Pounds 250,000 and other fees for
services provided by a privately-controlled company that organised social
events.
Mr Dick Richardson, the managing director, received more than Pounds 200,000
even though the company only made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.9m last year.
Tace board members were yesterday unavailable for comment. Mr Floyd said
Tace preferred peace rather than war with Norwich Union. Tace would use the
time before it has to call the EGM to meet the proposed new directors and
would possibly consider inviting them onto the board.
Norwich Union is also proposing as directors, Mr Christopher Glynn, who like
Mr Beckett was formerly of Consolidated Goldfields, Mr David Tucker, of M&amp;G,
and Mr Michael Rendle, a former managing director of BP.

<TEXT>
Britannia Life, the Glasgow-based subsidiary of Britannia Building Society,
yesterday agreed the purchase of the individual life and pensions business
of Crusader Insurance, a UK subsidiary of the US insurance group, Cigna
Corporation, writes Richard Lapper.
Britannia aims to expand its market share of both new business and total
funds under management. According to Mr Andrew Scobbie, the managing
director of Britannia Life, the purchase 'trebles our funds under management
to over Pounds 1bn and will provide very real prospects of achieving very
considerable benefits from economies of scale.'
Britannia, the ninth largest building society, recently acquired the
Mornington Building Society and is keen to expand in the insurance field.
It is understood that Cigna will receive a sum well in excess of Pounds 20m,
allowing it to pump more resources into its core employee benefits
activities.
Cigna is aiming to build its share of the rapidly growing health care
insurance market, which is currently around 5 per cent and will retain
Crusader's employee risk benefits and health care operations.
Last year Crusader Life, wrote annual premium income of about Pounds 75m.

PANFIDA, the heavily borrowed retailing company, has agreed to Pounds 17m in
settlement of its legal dispute with Guinness, the drinks group, concerning
the Pounds 190m price it paid for the Martins chain of newsagents in 1987.
The out-of-court settlement compares with a Pounds 50m breach of warranty
claim that Panfida launched nearly two years ago.
Panfida said the settlement comprises Pounds 17.05m less about Pounds 1.4m
worth of interest withholding tax, which it expected to be refunded in due
course.
Guinness said the settlement meant it had reduced the total net proceeds of
the sale by some Pounds 9m to Pounds 181m.
Panfida said most of the settlement monies would be invested in MRG
Holdings, which owns the 800 Martins newsagents. This now forms the
company's principal operating subsidiary.
Mandala Investments, a private Australian financial advisory company, is
being issued with Panfida warrants by way of a fee for assistance in
connection with the settlement.
The warrants enable Mandala to subscribe for four million ordinary shares,
at any time up to the end of 1996, at 25p each. That compares with
yesterday's 4p market price.
Guinness said it had maintained its denial of liability but accepted the
desirability of resolving the dispute.
Among other items, Panfida had alleged that Guinness cut back on necessary
repairs before the sale, thereby overstating the shops' estimated profit and
net asset value.

FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Goodwill move helps PWS up to Pounds 3.1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PWS Holdings, the Lloyd's reinsurance broking group, lifted pre-tax profits
from Pounds 2.73m to Pounds 3.11m in the six months to March 31. Brokerage
crept up from Pounds 8.54m to Pounds 8.77m.
Lord Pearson of Rannoch, chairman, said that the company had decided to
change its accounting policy on goodwill. This had the effect of increasing
profits by Pounds 198,000 in the half. Interest payable fell to Pounds
163,000 (Pounds 670,000) and this time there was no exceptional charge
(Pounds 400,000).
Earnings worked through at 10.1p (10.7p) per share and the interim dividend
is raised to 1.5p (1.3p). NEWS DIGEST

FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Harding over Pounds 1m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING CONDITIONS at Harding Group continued to worsen during the second
half of 1990, particularly in the last quarter and as a result the group,
which has interests in industrial and transport equipment and building
materials, dived to over Pounds 1m into the red.
Pre-tax losses for the year totalled Pounds 1.11m, against Pounds 821,000
profits previously, on turnover reduced from Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 25.6m.
As forewarned last September, the final dividend has been omitted leaving
the interim of 1.1p to compare with the 1989 total of 2.75p.
Mr Dennis Harding, chairman, said many group customers had also suffered
from the economic downturn which has had a considerable impact on the group.
A bad and doubtful debts charge of Pounds 110,000 for the first half was
increased to Pounds 560,000 for the year.
Provision had also been made for costs to be incurred in 1991 comprising
Pounds 110,000 for branch premises closed during the year and, which in the
present climate were difficult to dispose of, and a further Pounds 138,000
relating to management restructuring.
Mr Harding said trading in the current year had continued to be very
difficult.
An extraordinary profit of Pounds 2.39m (Pounds 124,000) arose from the
disposal of the Earthspan division. Losses per share were 3.84p (3.64p
earnings).

FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Prospect trebling size with Pounds 14.25m
Dunn purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECT INDUSTRIES, the Hull-based engineering group that was floated out
of Tace in 1989, is to triple in size by acquiring Dunn International, a
supplier of engineering services to the power generating sector, for Pounds
14.25m in cash and shares, writes David Owen.
The transaction will be part-funded by the placing by Henry Ansbacher of
59.67m ordinary shares at 12p, raising Pounds 7.16m.
This is a 2 1/4 p premium to the level at which Prospect shares were
temporarily suspended yesterday. It is expected that share dealing will
recommence on May 30 after an extraordinary general meeting to seek
shareholder approval for the proposals.
Yesterday's move is in line with Prospect's strategy of expanding through
acquisition within the engineering and related sectors. 'We have turned a
lot of stones and this is the acquisition we have brought forward,' said Mr
Philip Wilbraham, chairman and chief executive.
Under the terms of the deal, Prospect will pay an initial Pounds 10.25m in
cash and Pounds 1m by the allotment of 8.33m ordinary shares.
There is a deferred consideration of Pounds 3m to be satisfied in cash. In
addition, Pounds 3.75m of the initial cash payment will be used by the
vendors to subscribe for Prospect convertible preference shares.
The transaction will give the vendors about 9 per cent of Prospect's
enlarged 133m ordinary share base, while exercising the convertible could
put a further 12.5m shares in their hands. Wilbraham-related entities will
hold 20.7 per cent of the shares following the placing. Existing Dunn
directors are to enter two-year service contracts on completion of the deal.
Dunn's net assets at December 31 1990 totalled just Pounds 2.5m, which will
oblige Prospect to take a hefty goodwill write-down onto its balance-sheet.
The combined group looks like starting life about 200 per cent geared but
with interest at least six times covered.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Letter: Prudential under a spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From ROBYN GRANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, What has happened to the Prudential? After the estate agency debacle,
the directors appear to be paid more, and for the first time in 50 years the
reversionary bonus is cut by 8 per cent
Meanwhile, an expensive TV publicity programme is a constant reminder of my
very high uncompetitive 14.6 per cent house purchase loan. I can get no
response from the local office on whether I can repay my loan or expect a
reduction in interest rate.
I do, however, receive a renewal schedule of my Prudential household
insurance, up 29 per cent to Pounds 767. When I obtain a competitive
quotation this premium is reduced to Pounds 326. My impression is that this
new premium scale is for new customers and only for those existing
customers, in my case of 30 years, who complain.
Which company do you think I will advise my children to avoid?

FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: BP attacks Government on ACT reduction
scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH PETROLEUM hit back yesterday at the Government's decision to squash
its plans to issues shares in its Britoil subsidiary in an attempt to reduce
its Advance Corporation Tax bill.
Last month, BP announced that it was working on a complex plan to issue
so-called stapled shares as a way of saving about Pounds 150m this year in
ACT payments.
However on Thursday night the Government announced that it would be
introducing legislation into this year's Finance Bill to stop such schemes.
'We think our scheme was fair and legal and that we were very open with the
Government and Treasury over what we wanted to do,' BP said yesterday.
'The law allowed us to do this and in the interests of shareholders we hoped
to recover Pounds 150m. The Government's legislation is specifically
designed to block our scheme.'
BP said that despite this setback it would continue lobbying the Government
concerning the issue of Advanced Corporation Tax. BP is one of a number of
large companies which are unable to recover all the ACT they pay on
dividends because the bulk of their profits is earned overseas.
ACT can be set off against UK corporation tax but companies such as BP do
not earn enough profits in the UK to use up the backlog of prepaid ACT. The
total amount of unutilised ACT in the UK is thought to be as much as Pounds
750m.

FT  04 MAY 91 / A rich haul from the sound of music: The illicit copying and
sale of recorded music is a lucrative and damaging trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A record industry official was ambushed and shot in both knees on the
streets of Taipei last year. In Cairo last month, police seized 500,000
pirate cassette tapes. Earlier in the year, 1.5m were seized in Togo.
The illicit copying and sale of recorded music is a large and dangerous
business. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI)
estimates that pirates rack up worldwide sales of more than Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 578m) a year, compared with the Dollars 21.6bn earned annually by
legitimate record companies. The federation believes one out of every four
pre-recorded audio cassette tapes sold worldwide is a pirate copy.
Record pirates occasionally react violently to attempts to curb their
activities. But they have an effect which goes beyond the physical threat to
IFPI representatives. Apart from taking sales away from the legitimate
industry, the pirates pay no taxes and deprive aspiring musicians of their
royalties.
They also play havoc with the record companies' schedules for releasing new
recordings, says Mr Rob Stuyt, the board member responsible for intellectual
property issues at PolyGram, the music subsidiary of Philips, the Dutch
electronics giant. Pirate cassettes sometimes reach the market before the
genuine product, he says.
Sir John Morgan, president of the IFPI, says he was invited to look at a
consignment of captured pirate cassettes in the Ivory Coast in February,
along with the local head of EMI Music. 'The cassettes were more up to date
than the ones the EMI man had to put out legitimately,' Sir John says.
Few countries are untouched by record piracy. In Nigeria, the IFPI estimates
that 11.8m pirate recordings worth Dollars 18m were sold in 1989. In unit
terms, pirate sales accounted for 80 per cent of the market. In Kenya, the
2.4m illicit recordings sold accounted for 68 per cent of the market.
In Mexico, the IFPI estimates that 55m pirate recordings worth Dollars 75m
were sold in 1989, representing 50 per cent of the total market in unit
terms. In Ecuador, the 3m pirate recordings sold accounted for 69 per cent
of the overall market. India's pirate revenues were worth Dollars 141m in
1989, the IFPI says. The 152.5m units sold accounted for 52 per cent of the
overall market.
While Third World countries are the main focus for the pirates, the European
Community and the US are not immune. In Italy, Portugal and Greece, at least
20 per cent of recordings sold in 1989 were pirate copies, the federation
says. In the same year, nearly 46m illegal recordings worth Dollars 418.8m
were sold in the US, an estimated 6 per cent of total sales.
The federation achieved some successes during the 1980s, with government and
local police co-operation greatly reducing piracy in countries such as
Indonesia and Singapore. Now the music industry faces two new problems:
growing piracy in the newly-liberalised markets of eastern Europe and the
high quality of illegal recordings available on compact disc.
Sir John, who served as British ambassador in Poland, Korea and Mexico, says
one of the difficulties in eastern Europe is that record pirates became
heroes during the decades of communist rule. 'In countries like Poland and
Czechoslovakia, the record pirate was the guy bringing culture and the
latest rock music to the kids,' Sir John says. 'Now there's a need for
education. We have to persuade people that the pirate is the enemy of their
nascent music industry.'
He says Czechoslovakia has a tough anti-piracy law, but is not yet enforcing
it properly. Mr David Stockley, managing director of EMI's international
operations, says that tackling record piracy does not appear a high priority
for east European governments.
Poland has still not enacted legislation to protect the legitimate music
industry and, even when it does, there is no guarantee that piracy levels
there or elsewhere in eastern Europe will drop markedly. Record piracy is
international and its perpetrators can move their base of operations if
conditions become too difficult in any one country, Sir John says.
'We've now heard that one of the biggest pirates in Poland has gone to the
Soviet Union and set up there,' Sir John says. 'He's calculated that Polish
legislation will be in place before Soviet legislation.'
Sir John, however, sees some hope in the attempt by eastern European
countries to forge closer relationships with the EC.
'Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary are seeking association agreements with
the Community. Part of the requirement is that intellectual property rights
must be protected,' he says.
The record industry also faces another new problem: the manufacture of
pirate compact discs. Until the advent of the CD, most pirate recordings had
been on cassette. The tapes were often of low quality and were sold at a
price lower than that of the legitimate item. By contrast, Mr Stuyt says
that illicit CDs are being sold at the same price as his company's own
products.
In tracking down the compact disc pirates, the record companies are aided by
the relatively small number of CD manufacturing plants. Cassette tapes can
be copied in a pirate's home. The equipment necessary to manufacture a
compact disc, on the other hand, costs as much as Pounds 750,000, EMI's Mr
Stockley says. Setting up a CD factory costs about Pounds 1m in all. For
this reason, pirate discs are usually manufactured under contract by
legitimate plants.
Sir John recently visited a compact disc factory near Prague and showed its
management a Pink Floyd CD with an EMI label marked 'Made in West Germany'.
The managers admitted that they had made the CD under contract but had not
bothered to look at the small print on the label.
The difficulty for the record companies is that digital recording techniques
mean that pirated CDs are of comparable quality to the original products.
'Because they're almost identical to the real thing, piracy is difficult to
prove in court,' Mr Stuyt says.
Sir John says there are three steps to stamping out piracy. The first is the
adoption of a copyright law protecting the rights of the legitimate
industry. It is not only eastern European and Third World countries which do
not have adequate laws. Mr Stuyt points out that the Netherlands, Belgium
and Greece have also not enacted the necessary legislation.
The second step , Sir John says, it to get local law enforcement authorities
to take action against the pirates. The third is to secure convictions in
the courts and the imposition of substantial penalties.
Sir John says it is not always easy to convince courts that piracy is a
serious crime. The federation and record companies admit, too, that world
public opinion is not necessarily on their side.
People, they concede, confuse the campaign against piracy with attempts by
the record industry to stop them taping records or CDs in their homes. While
the federation stresses that this widespread practice is still theft, it
agrees that it is a different area of criminality.
The federation concedes too that public sympathy is limited by a perception
that western performers earn enough anyway. Mr Phil Collins, the British
rock star, admits in a recent IFPI publicity video that piracy has not
seriously undermined his lifestyle. He says, however, that it has retarded
the development of the music industry in much of the developing world.
Pirates do not pay royalties to performers. Deprived of the ability to
support themselves through music sales, many Third World musicians are faced
with the option of giving up or moving to Europe.
Mr Salif Keita, a popular Malian singer, says on the IFPI video: 'Never have
I been able to live from creating my music. The pirates prevent African
nations from progressing. If nothing is done to stop piracy there is a great
danger that African music will die.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Proof that journalists on the Spectator live on an entirely different
planet from the rest of us, was conclusively provided by Dominic Lawson in
his article, 'The angry young men who look back in yearning' (April 20).
He appears to inhabit one in which the US government's approach to the Kurds
is beyond all thought of reproach. Your readers live on one in which the
administration in 1921 gave the nod to a carve-up of the Ottoman Empire that
denied Kurds a homeland, and its successors have defended the sanctity of
those borders to this day; in which US representatives opposed a UN
resolution condemning the nerve-gassing of Kurds at Halabja in 1988; in
which US aircraft were bombing Kurdish population centres in Iraq just a few
weeks ago; in which it took a sustained worldwide outcry for the president
to pull from his hat a five-figure solution to a seven-figure problem.
Lest my anger be thought to be spilling into unreasoning anti-Americanism,
we might note that the UK government was the prime mover in the 1921
partition, leaving Iraqi government in the hands of a clique drawn from a
minority; if the Sunni ruling class were in any doubt as to how they were
expected to retain control of the Kurds and Shias, the RAF's well-documented
gassing of Kurdish villages in 1925 dispelled it effectively.
And those angry young men? True, the myopic is now confused by the anger
emanating from a variety of sexes, ages and temperaments. But the examples
pictured Stuffing the Poll Tax with your article, 'Killed by a citizens'
revolt' (March 16), would have been instantly recognisable.
On our planet there are one or two people who might have preferred them to
stick to writing plays. How about on Dominic Lawson's planet?

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The current debate in your columns about the BBC television licence has
some interesting parallels with the nearly departed poll tax. Poll tax was
thought by many people to be unfair, not least because it was levied on
every citizen. The proposed council tax, on the other hand, will be levied
on householders - heads of family who have taken on financial responsibility
of running their household.
The TV licence has always been a household, not a personal tax. The
probability that a whole family rather than just an individual would never
watch the BBC seems quite remote.
May I suggest that, when an increase in licence fee is next needed, it would
be more equitable if single occupancy households enjoy the same 25 per cent
discount that will be applied to the council tax.

Sir, As Mr Bescoby (letters, April 27) rightly points out, anyone with a
television is compelled to help pay for the BBC. He might have added that
everyone who buys goods advertised on TV - even if they do not have a set -
is compelled to help pay for ITV and Channel 4 (although the economic
analysis is more complex).
Luckily, this is less problematic in practice than in principle. Almost
everyone has a television, watches it a lot, and rightly regards the cost as
pretty trivial.
We could replace the licence fee with subscription. research shows that most
of us would subscribe to both BBC channels, but it would cost us a lot more
(because of higher collection and other costs) and we would lose BBC Radio.

Sir, I am one of your readers who is obviously easily bamboozled. I read an
article by Arthur Hellyer, whom I almost venerate, about peat (April 20).
I then read a letter by Lee St Lawrence (April 27) whom I feel, with that
name, I ought perhaps to venerate. He extols, as do some of my favourite
authorities, the value of coir.
I believe both of them - but as a consumer and a buyer with limited income
(albeit sufficient to see the FT) - I don't feel I know enough about the
costs. Could perhaps some other knowledgeable reader tell me evenhandedly
the economics and perhaps the comparative values as a gardening commodity.

FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Moorgate Smaller Cos launch could raise
Pounds 50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOORGATE Smaller Companies Income Trust yesterday became the second
investment trust to be launched this week, with an offer which could raise
as much as Pounds 50m.
A total of Pounds 37.5m has already been committed, and there is an
offer-for-subscription of a further Pounds 12.5m, of which half is
underwritten. This is an increase on the original target of between Pounds
15m and Pounds 30m.
The trust will be investing only in listed UK smaller companies, with market
capitalisations up to Pounds 200m, and avoiding the USM and unquoted stocks.
The same fund management group also manages the Moorgate Investment Trust,
which was the top performing smaller companies trust over 10 years to March
31, according to Micropal.
The ordinary shares are priced at 100p and are aiming for a gross dividend
yield of 5 1/2 per cent. Warrants are being sold separately at 35p, giving
the right to subscribe for a new share at 100p between 1992 and 2001.
Applications for the new trust must be for a minimum of 1,000 shares and
must be made by May 21.

FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Paper tiger roars his last after 47 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TOM WILDING, the chief executive of UK Paper is retiring after 47 years
in the paper industry. He made a small fortune from buying the company out
of Bowater Industries for Pounds 38m and then selling it three years later
for almost eight times as much.
He has been succeeded by Mr Monty August, another member of the buy-out
team, who was previously managing director of UK Paper's Sittingbourne
operations.
The genial and diminutive Mr Wilding, said yesterday: 'I am 61 and I just
felt myself that the company is now in a position for the younger men like
Monty and his team to pick up and run with it. I can then relax and enjoy my
retirement.'
UK Paper, the UK's biggest producer of printing and writing papers, has had
an eventful history in the past few years under Mr Wilding's direction.
In 1986, Bowater UK Paper - as it was then called - staged a Pounds 38m
management buy-out. Within 18 months the company was floated on the stock
market with a value of Pounds 108m. Its offer-for-sale was subscribed 11
times.
It did not survive for long as an independent company. Fletcher Challenge,
New Zealand's largest company, snatched it for Pounds 299m at the end of
1989 after topping a Pounds 236m offer from Metsa-Serla, the Finnish
forestry products group.
But the hectic changes in the company's ownership have tended to conceal an
almost equally frenetic development of UK Paper's business.
'When Fletcher Challenge bought us we were not the company that we bought
from Bowater. We had spent an awful lot of money and changed the direction
of the company,' Mr Wilding said.
After the buy-out Pounds 60m was invested in developing the three
manufacturing plants at Sittingbourne in Kent and Donside, near Aberdeen. A
further Pounds 45m has been spent since the acquisition by Fletcher
Challenge.
The company's capacity has increased from 250,000 tons at the time of the
buy-out to 400,000 today and is set to climb further as a new paper machine
at Sittingbourne comes fully on-stream.
Like most paper companies, UK Paper has been suffering from the downturn in
the paper cycle but its financial performance is now something of a mystery
to the outside world as it has been incorporated into Fletcher Challenge's
vast pulp and paper interests.
But it would be surprising if the company has been making much of a return
given the current difficulties in the market and the early stage of its
investment programme.
Asked whether he was happy with the investment in UK Paper, Mr Garry Mace,
chief executive officer of Fletcher Challenge's forest industries group,
joked: 'We can always be made a lot happier.'
But he added: 'We knew we were paying a full price but we were paying for
potential.'
Mr Wilding is certainly confident for the future of the company and for the
UK industry as a whole. 'The British paper industry is in better shape now
than at any time since the 1950s. Its revival has been a remarkable
achievement. We can aggressively push forward and take more share of the
market.'
Mr Wilding will not sever all ties with the company. He remains as
non-executive chairman but says: 'I intend to come in only when required.'

FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: The limits of intelligence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BILL MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am always surprised when intelligent people like Richard Dawkins give
evidence ('An evolving certainty that God cannot exist', April 27) that they
do not accept the fact that human intelligence, however formidable, is
finite. Using the type of analytical intelligence he does he will never be
able to understand that, when one refers to a belief or non-belief in God,
one is trying to conceptualise the infinite, which of course is impossible.
To suggest, as he does, that if physics cannot prove the existence of God,
there can be no God, demonstrates the awesome dangers this world would be in
if we were to entrust our future to intellectuals who are unable to
understand the limitations of their intelligence.
The Chinese, more wisely, ascribe all understandable human concepts and the
like as being yin or yang, which demonstrates the duality of nature. The
unity, or one, is God and beyond the reach of our intelligence, only in
reach of our belief.
I know this won't do for Richard Dawkins' intelligence, but that must be his
limitation.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Man in tne News: Union fielder who will need a good grip -
Jimmy Knapp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most surprising sights of the last two annual cricket matches
between members of the Trades Union Congress general council and labour
journalists has been Mr Jimmy Knapp fielding in the slips. Despite his white
hair, the leader of Britain's biggest rail union has twice dived to the
ground to hold an apparently impossible catch in one hand.
This week, Mr Knapp has been trying to repeat an equally tricky industrial
task: maintaining the respect of rail passengers while threatening strikes
on London Underground and British Rail that would cause them immense
disruption and inconvenience. Again, he is arguing not only for higher pay,
but for employers to hold back reforms of working agreements.
If the threatened one-day strikes - echoing the 'summer of discontent' in
1989 - were called, Mr Knapp would need all his persuasive powers. There are
signs of worry in the Labour party and the TUC that he would fail, harming
Labour's chances in the coming general election. Mr John Monks, TUC deputy
general secretary, met Mr Knapp last week to express concern privately.
Labour has bitter experience of the damage that strikes in public services
can cause. The winter of discontent in 1979 played a pivotal part in
bringing down the last Labour government. The party and unions have been
gingerly moving towards an understanding that workers would sacrifice some
intransigence over working practices to raise the quality of services.
The National Union of Railwaymen, which together with the old National Union
of Seamen now forms Mr Knapp's Rail, Maritime and Transport Union, is not an
obvious source for such new thinking. The RMT has called ballots on both
rail networks, while its old rival, the Aslef drivers union, has been more
cautious, and sought arbitration on British Rail over a 7 per cent pay
offer.
The years since Mr Knapp's 1983 election as NUR general secretary have seen
a succession of such ballots. Several have ended in failure, notably the
vote against strikes over the introduction of driver-only trains by BR in
1985. This year, the union's opposition to new flexible working contracts
for 6,500 BR signals and telecommunications staff has so far been
ineffective.
This has led to some managers' viewing Mr Knapp as a likeable but
ineffectual figure, caught between a left-wing executive and a membership
which is happier than the union pretends with pay and conditions. They cite
the difficulty he had in persuading the executive to call off the 1989
strikes, and the fact that signals staff have signed new contracts despite
union opposition.
Yet Mr Knapp is a man of deceptive qualities in more than age (he is only
50). He lacks the personal authority wielded by his right-wing predecessor
Mr Sid Weighell, but has displayed persistence and a shrewd tactical
strength in welding support from the public and his members in a coalition
against managers.
He has pursued one simple argument since his election as a left-wing
candidate in 1983: that the financial strategy of BR and its attempts to
reduce the public subsidy through property sales have been built on sand. He
says that the level of service in other European rail networks depends on
subsidies which can alone deliver cheaper fares and the pay rates for
workers which make them attractive employers.
The conviction with which he puts this case is helped by his immersion from
boyhood in the industry. He joined the railways at 15 as a signal box lad in
Ayrshire after spending his childhood watching trains on the Glasgow main
line. 'I have eat, slept and breathed (railways) all my life, and I have not
seen rail workers making the advances they should have,' he says.
This single-industry upbringing helps his credence with the public and in
talks. 'When Jimmy sits across the table from (other negotiators) he knows
more about the industry than they do,' says one RMT official. It also
explains his admiration for Arthur Scargill, leader of the National Union of
Mineworkers, despite their different styles in defending jobs in their
industries, and Mr Knapp's gentler demeanour.
His task in making the RMT appear more rational than the railway managers
has often been tough. The unwieldy structure of the NUR, with its full-time
national executive and powerful activist committees was criticised in a
study commissioned by the union itself just before the 1989 action. It
severely limits the freedom of manoeuvre for a democratically-inclined
leader.
This has not been helped by the merger with the NUS. Although this has
reprieved the NUR's automatic seat on the TUC general council by keeping the
combined union above 100,000 members, the poor and undisciplined NUS has
proved a tough administrative challenge since the merger. 'Getting the
merger was the easy bit, the hard work is now,' says Mr Knapp.
Mr Knapp has increased the strength of his union in two ways. First, he has
led a public campaign by the rail unions to persuade passengers that BR and
London Underground managers have acted capriciously and without a sensible
long-term strategy. That campaign has been pursued outside periods of
industrial conflict, and backed by well-produced booklets and leaflets.
His second tactic has been learned through experience. After the blow of a
defeat in a ballot to resist BR workshop closures in 1986, Mr Knapp
reflected that it was hard to gain broad votes for industrial action when
only sections of the union's membership were directly affected. Since then,
the RMT has failed to resist several changes affecting minority groups.
There are signs that employers have recognised this too, with BR attempting
its working practices restructuring which started with signals staff group
by group. But the NUR responded sagely in 1989 by wrapping its resistance to
pay bargaining changes on which there was muted membership support together
with the volatile issue of pay.
This time, the disputes over job cuts on London Underground and BR
restructuring have coincided once more with the annual pay round. 'The
issues are separate at the moment,' says Mr Knapp with the air of a
campaigner who has some shots in his locker if the battle gets rough.
Whether he would want it to become so is another matter: a second summer of
discontent would be a risky strategy.
It would not only be the Labour party that could suffer from strikes. London
Underground has already said it would prefer a short fierce battle to a long
one. Above all, a result would depend on whether passengers would again
sympathise with a tall white-haired Scot telling them the trains are
stopped. It would not be an impossible catch to hold, but it would be hard.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Third party enters the calculation / Assessment of
Thursday's local elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new prime minister with a social conscience worn on his sleeve rather than
on the sole of his shoe is not enough. Nor, after the local election
results, can the Conservatives be sure that another point or so off the
mortgage rate will renew Mr John Major's lease on 10 Downing Street.
The focus yesterday understandably was on the spectacular surge in support
for the Liberal Democrats. It would be churlish to begrudge the
indefatigable Mr Paddy Ashdown his triumph.
By-election victories in Eastbourne and Ribble Valley followed by a 20 per
cent share of the vote on Thursday have confirmed that he has rescued his
party from the oblivion threatened by its split with Dr David Owen's Social
Democratic party. Dr Owen, who has never disguised his contempt for his
erstwhile Liberal partners, has been left a supplicant at the doors of
Conservative Central Office.
The message emerging from the clatter of claims and counter-claims yesterday
was that Mr Major could well lose the next general election. Mr Ashdown
could end up helping Mr Neil Kinnock to replace him.
At least one cabinet member was prepared to acknowledge that the bookmakers
were justified in quoting Labour and the Conservatives as evens to emerge as
the largest party. The unspoken thought in the back of ministerial and
opposition minds was of a hung parliament.
There will be no election until the autumn at the earliest. Mr Major is
impatient for a new mandate. He hates the constant comparisons with Mrs
Margaret Thatcher. He will go to the country in October if he can. But he is
not so impatient that he can ignore the fact that his personal popularity
has so far failed to persuade the voters to forget and forgive.
Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, refuses to speculate on the election
date. But just as in recent weeks he has quietly been dishing the idea of
June, so now he will emphasise that 1992 is a real option.
The results this week were much worse than he had expected. Central Office's
private polling - like the published opinion surveys - completely missed the
surge in Liberal Democrat support. The final tally of losses was twice the
400 to 450 Mr Patten had prepared for.
He can make a plausible case that the losses were damaging but not
necessarily devastating. Depending on which samples you believe Labour had a
lead of between 3 and 6 points in the national share of the vote. But exit
polls suggested that in a general election, the government would have
emerged with a slight lead.
Mr Major started with a number of handicaps. His property-based alternative
to the poll tax was announced only two-thirds of the way through the
campaign. The economy is in the trough of the recession. Real incomes have
been squeezed and most households have yet to see the Pounds 140 reduction
in poll tax bills. The unfortunate timing of job losses at two NHS hospitals
allowed Labour to put the health service high on the agenda in the crucial
last few days.
Senior ministers predict that the watershed in their fortunes will come on
Friday May 17. Labour could well overturn the 10,000 Tory majority in the
Monmouth by-election on the previous day. But Mr Patten and his colleagues
are focusing on the publication on the Friday morning of the retail price
index for April. It will show recorded inflation crashing down from more
than 8 per cent to about 6 per cent. A cut in mortgage rates should follow.
From then on, Mr Patten's scenario shows the economic news consistently
improving. Inflation will be down to 4 per cent or below by the Autumn;
mortgage rates will probably fall for a second time; the buoyant level of
earnings of those in work will put real money into voters' pockets.
Mr Major the ditherer will emerge as the prime minister who is unafraid to
take tough decisions - but who then delivers on his promises. The government
will begin to stake out its election battleground. Labour's policies on
spending, taxation, the trades unions and defence will be the targets.
The Tory assessment of Mr Kinnock's performance is similarly sanguine. The
Labour leader, the argument runs, has been holding all the cards but he has
failed to make a decisive breakthrough. Disenchantment with the government
may persuade its supporters to lodge a protest vote with the Liberal
Democrats, but they can be won back.
Exit polls taken on Thursday lend credence to this view. They suggest, for
example, that the Conservatives would retake Ribble Valley in a general
election and that the Liberal Democrat share of the vote might fall to 15
per cent.
It is a credible thesis and if there was dismay among Conservative MPs
yesterday, there were few signs of the despair which gripped them last year.
But the thesis ignores the vital importance in politics of momentum. After
this week's voting, Mr Kinnock and Labour still hold the initiative. They
will not relinquish it easily.
In the House of Commons Mr Kinnock looks the more confident of the two
leaders. The inferiority complex which dogged him when he faced Mrs Margaret
Thatcher across the despatch box has gone. Mr Major, as he showed this week
when under fire over the health service, has yet to find a rhythm. His
responses to the opposition's attacks were brittle and unconvincing.
The prime minister's aides can point to opinion polls showing him a far more
popular choice in the country than Mr Kinnock. But that ignores the impact
of parliamentary performances on the morale of their respective supporters;
and sooner or later perceptions at Westminster tend to percolate into the
public consciousness.
There are other reasons for Labour cheer. If inflation is set to fall
rapidly, unemployment is likely to rise just as fast over the next few
months. Meanwhile Labour has demonstrated that it can win large numbers of
votes in the south where the recession has been biting deepest.
The Conservatives cannot take comfort from the surge in support for the
Liberal Democrats. If Mr Ashdown's success was repeated in a general
election, it would have little impact on the number of Liberal Democrat
seats at Westminster. But it could severely damage the Conservatives by
handing victory to Labour in large numbers of southern marginals.
During the 1980s the rise in third-party support did much to keep the
Conservatives in power. The parallels this week look closer to the rise in
the Liberal vote in 1964 and 1974. On both occasions, it let Labour in.
Mr Major can still win the general election. So too can Mr Kinnock.

The final agenda-setting meeting was held yesterday at Stormont Castle in
Belfast, when Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, met Unionist
representatives, led by Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, and
the Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist leader.
The meeting broke up after three hours with neither Mr Brooke nor the

FT  04 MAY 91 / French deal with Amoco cleared by MMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S tough stance against UK acquisitions by foreign
state-controlled companies suffered a further setback yesterday when the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission cleared the Pounds 300m acquisition by
France's Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, of the UK petrol-station and
refinery business of Amoco, the US oil group.
This was the fourth of five UK acquisitions by foreign state-controlled
companies to be cleared by the MMC since Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and
industry secretary, announced last July his aim of preventing
'nationalisation by the back door'.
Mr Lilley had referred the acquisition by Elf's UK subsidiary Elf Oil (GB)
to the MMC last December against the advice of the Office of Fair Trading.
The MMC found that the deal would not operate against the public interest.
The assets acquired by Elf include Amoco's 70 per cent share of an oil
refinery at Milford Haven, west Wales, owned jointly by Murco Petroleum,
some 200 petrol stations, and contracts to supply petrol to another 30
independent retailers.
The merger has enabled Elf to become an integrated oil company in the UK but
its market share of all petrol products remains small at three to five per
cent.
The MMC found that the French government, which owns 55.6 per cent of Elf,
could potentially influence the company's strategic policy, but all the
evidence, even from competitors, pointed to Elf being run in a normal
commercial way.
The MMC also looked at the French government's 33.9 per cent holding in
Total CFP, which has a four to six per cent share of the UK market. It
concluded that, as with Elf, the policy was to leave Total's management to
run the business. The MMC said it did not believe the Elf/Amoco deal made it
any more likely that the French would press Elf and Total to co-ordinate
their activities in order to exercise market power. The evidence was that
they were rivals.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Crumbling Prague cries out for renovation: Urgent action is
needed to restore the city of Bohemian kings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MILLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE alleyways behind the Gothic and Baroque facades of old Prague,
railway sleepers are propping up the city of the Bohemian kings. Timbers
wedged between the street and crumbling piers hold ancient bricks in place.
Heavy scaffolding like miners' trestles, protects passers-by from masonry
which threatens to topple.
Many of the historic buildings in the federal capital's showpiece quarters
are falling down; the need for renovation is pressing, and not just for
aesthetic reasons.
Prague needs the space - primarily for housing, which is at a premium, and
for offices and other development.
'We have whole gypsy villages living in a few rooms (in the centre),' says
Mr Ivan Plicka, principal engineer in the city architect's office. Much of
what is inhabited is inadequate: 40 per cent of flats in the inner city have
only a kitchen and one other room for living space. Fifteen per cent lack a
bathroom, a toilet or both.
Refitting unused and skeletal properties - some of them very old - and
converting sub-standard ones is a way of 'growing' within the confines of an
existing municipal plan. The city authorities want this to happen. It would
take pressure off the public transport system, which carries too many
commuters to bleak and services-poor estates on the periphery.
There is also an environmental consideration - modernising heating systems
would reduce the current dependence on polluting brown coal as a fuel.
But the task is large: 70,000 flats (14 per cent of Prague's total stock of
500,000 housing units) need 'thorough renewal', according to a report
prepared by the city planning office. And, says Mr Ivo Oberstein, the chief
architect, 30,000 new apartments are required.
No-one, however, is sure where the money will come from. No public funds
have been earmarked for restoration work. New legislation on heritage issues
 -expected to define priorities and the division of responsibilities - is
still being debated.
Mr Miroslav Base - an architect at Surpmo, the national institute for the
reconstruction of historic towns and monuments, estimates that Koruna 1bn
(Pounds 20m) is needed annually for the next 10 to 15 years simply to halt
the decay of old edifices within the 775 hectares of historic Prague alone.
'This is not so ambitious, but it is like constructing a bridge - you have
to put a lot of stones, invisibly, under water before the columns appear
above. It is the same story with the reconstruction business,' he says.
Private landlords - of whom a number are beginning to re-appear - are
discouraged from improving properties by the maintenance of controlled
rents.
Yet changes are afoot: the government plans soon to lift rent ceilings in
three or four steps, the first by an estimated 180 per cent, according to Mr
Oberstein. This should help to stimulate greater individual domestic
investment.
Prague is at the same time courting foreign investors. Last month, the city
hosted a two-day workshop on its urban development which attracted
architects from Finland,
The British are pursuing professional ties and joint ventures. Trehearne &amp;
Norman, the London architecture firm, maintains a small staff in Prague
which is advising Surpmo on the way property is valued and managed in a
market economy.
DY Davies International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Richmond-based
firm of architects DY Davies, collaborates with Prazsky Projektovy Ustav,
the Czechoslovak architects, engineers and planners, in attempts to develop
sites for offices and hotels.
But progress is slow. Legal uncertainties dog works which manage to get
under way. DY Davies had to abandon finished plans to rehabilitate the
Kounicky Palace in Panska Street when a local bank contested the title under
a recent law designed to reverse the expropriations made by the communists
between 1948 and 1989. The palace - one of the few to retain an unspoiled
courtyard - was once the address in Prague of the British Council, which had
intended to return to the building after an absence of nearly 40 years.
Some unorthodox conversion initiatives are more successful. Mr Daniel
Spicka, one of two restorers of Chateau Valtice, a Baroque palace in
Moravia, 270km from Prague, normally works from a three-room garret in the
capital. When he first rented the premises it had only two rooms. Suspicious
of one wall, he took a heavy hammer and knocked it down - to reveal a third
vaulted chamber behind, in which he and the other members of his early music
ensemble now practise.

MR Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, yesterday said Yugoslavia's
western republic was on the 'verge of open warfare' after the most violent
clashes between Serbs and Croats since the Second World War.
At least 16 people were killed and 20 wounded on Thursday night after hours
of gunfighting in the village of Borovo Selo in northern Croatia.
In a television address yesterday, Mr Tudjman said Croatia 'will reconsider
overall relations with the republic of Serbia in light of the
well-established fact that not only has Serbia supported and encouraged
terrorist actions and insurrection . . . but has directly organised the
clashes'.
The shooting reportedly started when Croatian security forces entered the
predominantly Serbian village, in search of three missing policemen. Mr
Stipe Mesic, who will become federal president later this month, said: 'Some
of the bodies had been butchered.'
'I hope reason prevails in the army. Until now the army has not permitted
itself to side with the rebels,' Mr Tudjman said yesterday. The village is
now sealed off.
Relations between Serbs and Croats, Yugoslavia's two biggest ethnic groups,
have deteriorated as Croatia's Serbs seek to secede from the western
republic to join Serbia.
Mr Tudjman accused Serbia, led by President Slobodan Milosevic, of
encouraging rebellion among Croatia's Serbs.
Armed clashes, bombs and the mining of railway lines have become
increasingly frequent since last autumn when Serbs, who are in a majority in
Croatia's southern region of Krajina, proclaimed autonomy. They say Krajina
will join Serbia if Croatia seeks independence from Yugoslavia.
Serbian demands for autonomy since March have spread to Serbs in northern
Croatia. But the government of Croatia insists the independence-minded
republic will secede if the present federation of six republics is not
transformed into a loose organisation of independent states.
The state presidency, the eight-member head of state which is made up of
representatives from the six republics and two provinces, today will hold an
emergency meeting.

FT  04 MAY 91 / More cash for poor EC members sought
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SPAIN has snubbed EC attempts to get north-south economic disparities within
the Community off the agenda for European union, by re-presenting its ideas
for an equalising budgetary fund on federal lines.
Madrid's renewed bid for more money for the EC's laggards 'greatly
complicates' the already difficult negotiations being conducted on economic,
monetary, and political union, senior EC officials and diplomats said
yesterday.
In a hardened version of the ideas it put to the inter-governmental
conference (IGC) on political union in early March. Spain is insisting on:
an 'inter-state compensation fund' to invest in 'physical and human capital'
in those EC members whose gross domestic product per capita is below 90 per
cent of the Community average.
a progressive system of taxation for the EC budget, with contributions by
member states measured by their 'relative prosperity';
a change in policy for aid to backward regions, which would loosen member
governments' current obligations to contribute to the financing of EC-backed
projects, instead matching this to their 'financial capacity'.
Madrid's proposals for revising the Treaty of Rome were re-submitted to the
IGC on political union on Thursday, as tantamount to Spain's price for
agreement on the economic and monetary union accord being negotiated in
parallel.
A compromise suggested last month, by the current Luxembourg presidency of
the Community, was last week dismissed as 'unacceptable' by a senior Spanish
official.
Unlike its poorer colleagues at the bottom of the EC development division -
Ireland, Portugal and Greece - Spain gets little out of the EC budget in net
terms. In 1989 it put in Ecu3.6bn (Pounds 2.5bn) and got back Ecu3.5bn.
But Spain's demand that the EC should redistribute wealth southwards by
straight budgetary transfers has so far been backed only by Ireland. The
Commission would prefer less overtly federalist means.
Commission research suggests it would take 20 years for the EC's four poorer
members to reach the GDP per head of 90 per cent of the Community average
wanted by Spain.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Bush rejects charges over Iranian hostages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday angrily rejected allegations that he visited
Paris in 1980 to help the Reagan presidential campaign strike a deal with
Iran to delay the release of American hostages until after the election that
November.
Mr Bush's denial - the first time he has specifically addressed the issue -
came amid calls in the US press and among Democrats in Congress for an
inquiry into the persistent but unproven allegation that the Reagan team
manipulated the hostage issue to ensure President Jimmy Carter's defeat in
1980.
The story has gathered momentum since Mr Gary Sick, a senior Carter
administration official, set out the case for an inquiry in a lengthy
article last month in the New York Times which drew on interviews with
multiple sources in eight countries in four continents.
Journalists, historians and politicians alike have never been able to show
that Iran's agreement to release the 52 Americans in Tehran, just minutes
after the inauguration of President Ronald Reagan in January 1981, was
anything more than coincidence.
This week, the State Department fuelled speculation by denying a visa to Mr
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, former Iranian president, who wanted to visit the US
to promote his book which repeated the allegations. The department reversed
itself yesterday, and Mr Bani-Sadr was said by his US publisher to be taking
the next available flight from his exile home in Paris.
Mr Bush sounded testy when confronted with reporters' questions that he
brokered the deal with Iran to delay the release of the hostages in return
for later arms sales from Israel. He called the stories 'rumour mongering'
and 'sickening', denying point-blank that he visited Paris.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, press secretary, sought to kill the story by calling Mr
Sick, a respected Middle East expert who served in both the Ford and Carter
administrations, 'the Kitty Kelley of foreign policy' - a reference to the
controversial biographer of Mrs Nancy Reagan.
Although respected newspapers such as the New York Times and Washington Post
have expressed support for an inquiry, the mood among Democrats appears
mixed - particularly in the absence of the proverbial 'smoking gun'.
Mr Tom Foley, House speaker, said the accusations merited investigation. But
Mr Lee Hamilton, an influential member of the House foreign affairs
committee, said after an informal meeting with Mr Sick this week that 'we
have reached no conclusions about what (he) said, and certainly no
conclusions about what follows.'
Privately, someDemocrats worry that some of the sources of the allegations
are Israelis who say they used to work for Mossad, the Israeli intelligence
service.
Foreign policy observers in Washington note that the allegations have
resurfaced after the Gulf war - the very time when the Bush administration
would like to exert pressure on Israel to be more co-operative in the Middle
East peace process.

FT  04 MAY 91 / EC car makers' recycling plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EC CAR manufacturers yesterday unveiled proposals for a vehicle 'waste
management' programme which they hope will head off legislation making them
responsible for recycling every car they sell within EC borders.
Pressure for mandatory recycling programmes is being led by Germany, which
has already asked its domestic-based manufacturers, Volkswagen,
Daimler-Benz, BMW and Opel, to come up with firm proposals within the next
few months on how vehicles might best be completely recycled.
The EC Commission is taking particular interest in the progress of the
intended German legislation. This is not just for environmental reasons, but
because of the internal trade barrier implications of German makers being
required to recycle cars ahead of similar requirements being made of other
car makers.
Currently, the EC industry average is for about 75 per cent of car content
to be recycled.
German legislation is expected to require much closer to 100 per cent
recycling - a stance likely to be adopted eventually by the EC itself.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Turkish border closure hampers aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY closed its main border route into Iraq for more than three hours
yesterday, cutting the overland flow of allied relief to Kurdish refugees in
the region, US military officials confirmed.
The incident came as Turkey decided to expel a British reporter whom it
accused of 'biased' reporting. The article by Robert Fisk, correspondent for
The Independent, alleged that Turkish troops were stealing aid supplies.
In Ankara, Mr Morton Abramowitz, US ambassador to Turkey, sought to play
down the significance of the border closure.
He said the problem was caused by Turkish construction workers, due to enter
northern Iraq to work on setting up allied refugee camps. They arrived
without proper documentation, he said.
'This is not something we are trying to single out. Please understand that
these are the sort of problems that occur in any big operation.
'We are not talking about major problems, we are talking about problems that
constantly arise in any operation, especially one of this magnitude,' he
said.
The incidents came after a rise in tension between Turkey and the allied
forces working to move hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurdish refugees back
to their homes.
The closing of the border and the expulsion of the journalist appeared to
reflect the anger felt by Turkey's military over its loss of control of
operations within its country, and the critical portrayal of Turkish
soldiers in the foreign media.
The Independent said Turkish authorities had declared that Mr Fisk, defence
correspondent Christopher Bellamy, staff reporter Phil Reeves and Richard
Wayman, a freelance photographer working for the paper, persona non grata
and had withdrawn their press credentials.
Meanwhile the United Nations took the first formal step to obtain the
payment of compensation by Iraq under the ceasefire terms, creating a
special fund to be financed from the country's oil revenues.
But in a report to the Security Council, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar,
secretary general, acknowledged that ensuring financing for this
compensation fund would be among the most technical and difficult tasks to
be undertaken by its proposed commission of experts in finance, law,
accountancy, insurance and environment damage-assessment.
Among the options he suggested to ensure that Iraq honoured its pledge to
make reparations was the setting-aside of a percentage of the market value
of oil exports or the acquisition of a physical share of such exports for
direct sale on the market on the fund's behalf. 'It must be recognised that,
in all probability, it may be some time before Iraq is able to resume oil
exports,' he said. Also, at any given time, the value of claims approved by
the commission, a subsidiary organ of the Security Council, was likely to
exceed the fund's resources.
The EC and the British government are to co-finance 20 'mobile support
teams' to help Kurdish refugees return to Iraq, David Gardner reports from
Brussels.
Volunteers from the UK's fire and ambulance services, hospitals and
Territorial Army, are to be deployed for three months, financed by Ecu2m
(Pounds 1.39m) from Brussels and Ecu0.9m from London.
The EC has already mounted three other joint operations in northern Iraq -
with France, Belgium and the Netherlands - as part of its commitment of
Ecu150m in aid to the Kurds. Joint action is seen as a way of reducing
growing aid demands on a badly strained budget.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Survey of Franchising (5): Banks warm to those lower risk
options - Raising Finance / There are special packages on offer for the
right team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOULD-BE franchisees who have teamed up with an established franchisor can
expect a favourable deal from their bank manager when they approach him for
start-up finance. Many of the UK banks offer special franchise packages
which reflect what they see as the lower risks attached to a franchised
business.
Nevertheless, two years of very high interest rates have reduced the influx
of new entrants to the franchise sector. The broad middle range of
franchisees who have to take out a bank loan secured on their home to fund a
franchise in the Pounds 50,000-Pounds 120,000 range have been hard hit.
The high cost of borrowing; the reduced value of their home to be used as
security; and the difficulty of selling their home to relocate to a district
where a franchise is available have combined to cut the numbers of potential
franchisees.
The wealthy investors and businessmen buying into highly priced hotel and
fast food franchises - often taking up several outlets at a time - have not
been so adversely affected. Nor have the individuals paying out up to Pounds
20,000 for a van and a set of tools to carry out car repairs or domestic
cleaning. Applicants for what are sometimes called job franchises can often
finance entry from redundancy pay or savings.
For franchisees who do need to turn to a bank for finance the big four
clearing banks and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) have specialist
franchising departments. Lloyds Bank has had a franchise department for the
past five years and has a head office team of three specialists. National
Westminster Bank claims to have been the first into the market with the
appointment of a franchise manager in 1981 and it has a team of 12 people in
the UK. The bank has lent more than Pounds 200m to franchisees over the past
10 years, virtually without loss, according to Mr Peter Stern, senior
franchise manager.
Mr Stern contrasts the enthusiasm of the UK banks for franchising with what
he sees as the relative neglect of the sector by the banks in the US.
Sometimes franchising and licencing activities - both of which can involve
issues such as brand name and trade mark protection - are combined.
NatWest's franchise department also handles retail licencing - where a
company allows others to use its retail formula without going as far as
fully-fledged franchising - while the RBS's franchise team also deal with
technology licencing.
Somewhat unorthodox competition for the established banks emerged just over
a year ago when AIB Bank (formerly Allied Irish Bank) teamed up with
Commercial Union Assurance and the Centre for Franchise Marketing, a
consultancy, to offer franchise finance. This arrangement, known as the
Franchise Alliance, was intended to help the two financial partners prise an
opening into a market dominated by the four large clearing banks.
With the promise of a decision on finance within 48 hours and the offer to
visit would-be borrowers at their home or premises instead of requiring them
to come into a bank, the alliance has financed just over 350 franchisees,
according to Mr David Taube of the Centre for Franchise Marketing. Funds
have been provided to franchisees of established organisations such as the
Body Shop as well as to newly-formed franchises, he says.
The banks are convinced enough of the additional security provided by the
franchise formula to increase the ratio of finance they will provide
compared with the sums available to other businesses. NatWest and Royal Bank
of Scotland, for example, will provide twice the sum invested in the
franchise by the franchisee compared with its normal lending ratio of 1:1.
Propositions must be proven franchises which can pass the banks' vetting
criteria.
Even franchised businesses have their financial limits. 'Invariably, if a
local branch manager has been persuaded by a franchisee to provide him with
100 per cent finance, the franchisee struggles,' says Mr Stern.
As well as vetting the franchisee, the bank looks closely at the franchisor.
It assesses the success of the franchisor's pilot operation, if the
franchise is a new one, his management experience and his finances. This
ensures the company is strong enough to develop a franchising chain.
Of the two-thirds finance which NatWest provides, it would normally expect
security for 50 to 60 per cent though if less security was available it
might still go ahead by lending under the government's Loan Guarantee
Scheme. The balance of the lending would be unsecured. The bank takes no
security from the franchisor though it does expect the franchisee to allow
it to talk to the franchisor if the franchisee does not perform
satisfactorily.
With an estimated 5 to 6 per cent of franchisees failing each year the 2:1
lending ratio and the security taken on the amount loaned combine to reduce
the bank's risk to just 1.5 to 2 per cent each year, Mr Stern calculates.
Although the banks frequently establish close links with franchisors they
emphasise that providing finance for a particular franchise does not imply
the bank's formal endorsement. The franchisee is still expected to carry out
his own checks on the soundness of the business he is taking on.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Survey of Franchising (6): Every walk of life covered by a
franchise - United States
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON, New York
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM baseball to burgers, bookkeeping to baby-minding, franchising in the US
is big business.
Sales of goods and services by the country's 500,000 franchises is expected
to reach Dollars 758.5bn this year, or one-third of all retail sales in the
US, according to the International Franchise Association (IFA) based in
Washington DC.
If their sales were translated into national product, US franchises would
qualify as the seventh largest economy in the world. More than 7.2m
Americans are employed by franchises in over 60 different industries.
Between 1987 and 1989 franchises created 400,000 jobs. In comparison, the
500 biggest companies in the US added just 10,000 new jobs over the same
period. A new franchise opens every 16 minutes somewhere in the country.
Franchising covers virtually every walk of life. The largest and most
established franchise operations are the fast-food outlets such as
McDonald's, Burger King and Kentucky Fried Chicken (rechristened 'KFC' to
appeal to a younger audience), the petrol service stations, the auto dealers
and the soft drink bottling operations, such as those operated for Pepsico.
Then there are the non-food specialist retailers such as Body Shop of the
UK, the convenience stores, the hotel/motel chains, the hairdressers, and
laundry and dry cleaners. Less well-known are the franchise businesses which
clean, paint, decorate or carpet homes throughout the US, or the franchised
real estate agencies which buy and sell those homes.
Cars can be purchased or rented, tuned and washed through franchises, pets
can be cared for, and very young children educated and exercised.
An especially fast-growing area of franchising is in providing support to
businesses and the services industry, such as equipment rental, printing and
copying, accounting, recruitment, and credit collection.
On a more glamorous level, American football, baseball, ice hockey and
basketball teams in the US are all franchises, owned and run by business
consortiums or individual multi-millionaires under the watchful eye of the
games' ruling bodies.
This year two new baseball franchises will be awarded to extend the reach of
the country's national game, with Miami the city likely to be first in line
to earn the right to host a team. Although several decades old as a business
concept in the US, those in franchising are confident that the there is
plenty of room left for new growth.
Mr John Naisbitt, a business author who recently conducted a study of
franchising on behalf of the IFA, predicts that franchising will account for
more than half of all retail sales by the end of the 1990's. Mr John
Reynolds of the IFA, however, believes that day could come earlier: 'The
growth potential is unlimited at this point.'
This confidence has not been dented by the recession in the US; if anything,
the nature of franchises makes them better equipped to ride out rough
economic times, argues the industry.
Although not immune to the nationwide decline in consumer confidence and
retail spending, the operators of franchises (franchisees) are afforded
considerable protection within the franchising system by the franchisor (the
originator and owner of the concept), and by consumers' familiarity with the
name and product.
Advertising and marketing is usually controlled and paid for by the
franchisor, enabling franchisees to reap the benefits of a high public
profile yet avoid a cost they would normally be unable to afford.
Mr Reynolds of the IFA believes many franchisors have responded to the
recession by increasing promotional expenditure to help franchisees maintain
sales during the economic downturn.
There are economies of scale to be enjoyed, such as co-operative purchasing
policies which allow franchises to buy raw materials and goods at cheaper
prices.
There have also been instances of franchisors helping struggling franchisees
by cutting their royalty rates (the share of the profits they receive each
year).
As Mr Arthur Karp, president of The Great American Cookie company, one of
the largest US franchisors, says: 'A franchisee is in business for himself,
but not by himself.' One positive feature of the US recession has been the
number of what are euphemistically called 'displaced executives' entering
the franchise business.
The economic downturn, and particularly the restructurings of the financial
services industry, has put a lot of experienced, high-income executives,
armed with significant capital from their redundancy agreements, out on the
street in search of work.
An increasing number of these executives, especially those with marketing
experience, have put their skills to good use in running a franchise
operation.
Mr Ron Sommers, a franchise development consultant in New Jersey, estimates
there has been a 30 per cent increase in the number of displaced executives
entering franchising in the past year.
This pool of skilled businessmen has helped franchising maintain its steady
growth during the recession.
In the past year, the area of franchising that has enjoyed the most rapid
growth is franchises in the service sector. The rapid expansion in the
services industry throughout the US since the mid-1980s is spilling over
into franchising, with increasing numbers of services provided by franchise
operations.
Social changes, in particular the rise in the number of multi-income
families, has also had its effect on franchising. Busy working wives and
husbands are turning to franchises to do the chores they would normally
handle in their own non-working time, such as laundry, household cleaning
and decoration, bookkeeping, and child-minding.
Although the rate of failure in franchising is remarkably low (a Commerce
Department report estimated only 5 per cent of franchises failed but with
some failed business bought back by franchisors, the actual number is
probably nearer 10 per cent), market oversaturation remains a problem, and
one of the primary causes of business failure.
A recent example in the US was the explosion in retail franchises selling
computer software and hardware, many of which went to the wall in the late
1980s early 1990s as intense competition led to price-cutting, slashed
margins and eventually collapse.
Competition in other areas, however, continues to lead to innovation. The
fast-food business is undoubtedly oversaturated in the US, and a price war
among the leading franchise chains has broken out. The franchises are also
facing competition from smaller operators, such as the double-drive-ins, the
mobile fast-food outlets which set up camp in shopping malls or at sporting
locations and sell cheap meals very quickly to the passing public.
In an attempt to compete, the big franchises are looking to develop their
own versions of double-drive-ins. Mr Greg Reynolds, vice-president at KFC,
says his company is testing the concept of mobile KFC outlets.
'We have to be wherever the customer may be whenever he says: 'I'd like
something to eat'.' The big franchisors facing oversaturation at home are
looking to expand abroad, especially in Mexico, and continental Europe,
where the unification of European Community markets in 1992 and the
rebuilding of the old Soviet-bloc offer tempting opportunities. It has
missed no-one's attention that the single most successful franchise
restaurant run by McDonald's is in Moscow.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Survey of Franchising (7): Sales grooming helps business off
the ground - Marketing experience is useful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL

KATRINA Moss went into franchising for the simple reason that she failed to
see why she had to work so hard for someone else without getting the
financial rewards for her efforts.
'My background was in selling but I didn't really know what I could do with
it to set up a business on my own,' she recalls.
Ms Moss, then in her late 20s, researched the franchise market for about two
years. She was looking for a business in which she could take advantage of
her background in sales and marketing for such companies as Thomson
Directories and the Post Office's on-site video sales operation.
'The trouble was that many franchises on offer were too expensive or in such
areas as cleaning, which wasn't what I wanted at all,' she recalls.
But then Ms Moss did something against the advice of all the franchise books
and magazines. 'I saw an advertisement in a newspaper on a Thursday, visited
the company concerned on the Friday and signed up on the Monday.
'I know it was the wrong thing to do but I was so fed up with waiting that
when I saw something I really wanted, I grabbed at it.' She does not advise
others to follow the same approach, when caution is the watchword for
would-be franchisees.
The franchise that had captured her attention was called Re-Nu, a somewhat
twee name for what is a simple idea. Instead of householders splashing out
on a new kitchen, the Re-Nu system uses the frames of existing kitchen units
to create a 'new' kitchen for a fraction of the price of a new one.
The concept was the brainchild of chairman Mr Mal Weeraratne, who has
established a network of 60 franchises in the UK and hopes for 100 by the
end of this year. 'We have ex-miners, nurses, housewives and service
personnel all running successful businesses,' he says. 'Our strength lies in
our business plan which, if adhered to, can produce profits of Pounds 40,000
plus in the first year.' Initial investment is Pounds 20,000, of which
Pounds 6,000 is the franchise fee.
Ms Moss did not quite reach that target at first. She started her franchise
business at the age of 30 in May 1988, working from her Surrey home and
covering the Kingston, Epsom and Esher areas.
She missed her first year sales target of Pounds 100,000 by Pounds 8,000
because, she says, of problems with her telephones. In her second year, in
spite of illness she managed to increase turnover.
In her third year, she expected recession to hit sales: 'But it's been our
best year ever, probably because the recession has forced people to look for
cheaper alternatives to having a completely new kitchen.'
Her biggest problem, she recalls, was getting to grips with the mechanics of
running a business: 'I was good at sales and marketing but didn't have any
experience in administration, VAT returns and so on.'
With more than 200 kitchens fitted, she finds that much of her business
comes from referrals, although she spends some 15 per cent of turnover on
advertising.
After three years, she employs a salesperson and two fitters. More
important, she can now afford to work part-time (between 20 and 30 hours a
week) from home and still earn more than she did when in full-time
employment.
'I don't think you can work part-time from the start and I think it helped
me enormously to have a sales and marketing background which saved a lot of
time in getting sales off the ground,' she recalls. 'But it has certainly
changed my life for the better]'

FT  04 MAY 91 / Survey of Franchising (3): Recession clouds the future -
Becoming a Franchisee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY of the visitors to next weekend's franchise exhibition at Olympia will
be looking for the small business opportunity that will change their lives.
They will be nurturing the dream of running their own business, with all the
benefits of self-employment and escape from the frustrations of working for
a large organisation.
For many would-be franchisees the dream will remain simply a fantasy escape
from their present job. But, equally, many will find in franchising the
opportunity they are seeking and actively take up a franchise within the
next 12 months.
This year, however, the dream is also tinged with the reality of the
recession. Many franchisees that joined the consumer spending bandwagon of
the 1980s - especially in the retail sector - have caught a chill in the
early 1990s. What seemed a licence to print money when the going was good,
can seem more of a millstone.
A report last year into the financial performance of the UK's top 100
business format franchises suggested that nearly one-third were losing money
with one in every 10 insolvent and trading illegally. The report, from
Oxford-based consultants CAMC, said that the franchise business had split
into respectable and 'cowboy' operations.
On one side, the report concluded, was a substantial minority of successful,
well-run franchise operations made up of highly-innovative start-ups as well
as the more established business-format franchises.
The other side of the industry, it argued, consisted of an 'unwholesome
concoction of cowboy outfits, look-alike versions of better-known and run
enterprises; weak conceptions bolstered by over-optimism and grand claims,
together with born-again failures rising phoenix-like from the ashes of
previous ventures.'
Set against this rather pessimistic view of franchising are other surveys,
such as that carried out annually by the British Franchise Association and
National Westminster Bank, which suggest that only about one in every 20
franchisees (with franchises which are affiliated to the BFA) fail.
Mr Rob Ormond, franchise manager with Lloyds Bank, points out that the
failure rate for new businesses in general is 25 per cent in the first year
and up to 70 per cent over the initial five years. 'But over 90 per cent of
franchises survive into the second year,' he says.
Taking on a franchise with one of the more reputable and well-established
franchise operations, and raising finance through a bank or other
institution, reduces the potential risks. But it is by no means a guarantee
of success.
So why do people take up franchises?
Franchising offers most of the advantages of running your own business -
such as independence and job satisfaction - without many of the drawbacks
which result in the high failure rate for small businesses.
Although the average franchisee is aged about 40, married with children, and
with a history of fairly steady employment there is really no such animal as
the typical franchisee.
Most were either white collar workers or self-employed before entering
franchising: the shake-out among white collar workers in the south-east
during the present recession has bolstered this trend.
According to the BFA/Natwest franchise survey, people take up franchises for
a variety of reasons. Of those surveyed, 32 per cent were motivated by what
they described as 'personal fulfilment' with an equal number stating that
their reason was 'what the system had to offer'.
Some 18 per cent said that it was a 'matter of chance'.
In some areas their attitude changed with experience. Initially, for
example, only 11 per cent gave the safety factor as a primary motive, but
safety was emphasised by 26 per cent of those asked about their current
views of franchising, reflecting the impact of the recession.
Most franchisees are individuals rather than companies, operating either as
one person units performing a service or as owners of small retail units
employing staff to help them. The BFA's survey showed that some 16 per cent
operated more than one unit within the same franchise system.
Before becoming a franchisee, would-be entrepreneurs should consider a
number of factors.
Not least are their motivations for going into franchising: people should
not delude themselves when considering their own capabilities and long-term
ambitions.
Potential franchisees have to establish whether or not they have the
emotional and physical stamina to work long hours to establish a business;
and whether or not they can cope with the lack of security involved in not
working for a salary paid by a company.
In addition, it is important that a would-be franchisee discusses with their
partner the hard work and commitment needed to make a franchise successful.
Both may need to put in a great deal of work and it may be that, after
careful consideration, the financial strain in the short-term and possible
long and unsocial hours are simply not worth it.
Potential franchisees who are satisfied that they have the right attitude to
become a franchisee, then have to decide what sort of operation to get into.
Do you, for example, want to run a fast-food outlet with the unsocial hours,
or be constantly on call for a service business such as drain-cleaning? Or
would you prefer to work more normal hours in a retail franchise such as
instant printing or film developing?
Another determining factor is the amount of capital you have available or
have access to. Small service franchisees cost considerably less than a
fast-food operation which has high start-up costs. But choosing a franchise
simply on the amount of funds available - rather than because you feel it is
right for you - may lead to problems later.
Choosing the franchisor can also be fraught with difficulties for the
potential franchisee. One easy way of sorting out the better franchisors is
simply through considering the way the franchise is offered.
For example, the use of an advertisement that gives only a post office box
number may be an early warning sign.
In addition, the first personal contact with the franchisor can give some
clue as to the type of operation run by the franchisor. Where the initial
meeting is held - office, hotel, room or bar - can be a clue, although
would-be franchisees should be wary of being taken in by a too-affluent
setting for the initial meeting.
One franchise consultant suggests that potential franchisees remember 'that
the good franchisor is someone who wants to form a lasting partnership with
you and not just sell you something quickly which you will regret later'.
It is possible to tell much about a company by establishing such facts as
how long it is has been in business, its financial strength (including
credit rating) and the bank references it offers. Potential franchisees
should ask about its plans and prospective development, how selective it is
in choosing franchisees, and how successful these become. Ask to talk to
some of the franchisees at random.
The anecdotal evidence from the leading banks involved in franchising is
that so far during this recession, franchised businesses have been faring
better than most small-businesses in general. Franchising is no panacea for
the would-be entrepreneur; but the risk element is such that those wanting
to go it alone should give it serious consideration.
There are many useful books on the subject.
Among these are: Franchising by Peter Hall &amp; Rob Dixon and published by
Pitman for NatWest; and the Barclays guide to Franchising for the small
business, by John Stanworth and Brian Smith, and published by Blackwell.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Survey of Franchising (2): Expansion routes - Becoming a
Franchisor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIDEN O'Kelly, general manager of Hertz car rental business in the UK, has a
typically pragmatic view about the benefits of franchising: 'It is clearly
one of the most cost-effective ways for financing and managing our expansion
in the UK.'
While franchising as a means of expansion has had a bad Press in recent
months as a result of the problems faced by some retail franchises during
the recession, a number of companies such as Hertz still see franchising as
an important part of their business expansion plans.
It has 40 franchised outlets out of a total of 142 and is seeking to double
its turnover from franchising over the next two years.
Commercial Union is believed to be poised to launch a new franchised
financial services product although details are being kept under wraps at
present. Lucas, the automotive spares company, has launched its Autocentre
franchise to build on its existing 54 Autocentres around the country.
'Many large companies are actively considering franchise developments, both
in the UK and overseas,' points out Mr David Acheson, franchise consultant
with Stoy Hayward.
UK retailers such as Marks and Spencer and Thorntons are looking at
franchising as a way of growing internationally. Some continental and
American chains are eyeing the potential for franchising in the British
market. I Can't Believe It's Yogurt], a successful US franchise, has just
launched in the UK.
French companies are particularly keen on the UK market since franchising
has proved such a popular growth vehicle in France. It has some 675
franchisors, twice the number in the UK, with a market worth some Pounds
10bn.
One of the most successful UK franchisors of recent years has been the Body
Shop, the specialist cosmetics chain which emphasises natural products. Yet
Sock Shop and Tie Rack, two other niche retailers of recent years who grew
by franchising, have found the going much tougher. Tie Rack, for example,
has had to terminate the franchises of some franchisees 'who breached their
contracts in relation to standards of operation and payment of debt.'
The main advantages for companies of expanding through franchising are
two-fold. First, it enables a company with a successful operation to expand
more quickly than could otherwise be achieved using its own capital.
Secondly, the problem of finding highly-motivated branch management is
overcome by the expedient of having the 'manager' work for himself as a
franchisee.
In addition, the routine administrative problems which can bedevil ordinary
company-owned chains are reduced by the franchising system. The franchisor,
moreover, obtains greater buying muscle through having an expanding number
of tied outlets.
However, franchising as a means of growth can have its drawbacks. Loss of
management control over franchisees can sometimes lead to harming of the
national image that the franchisor is seeking to establish. The classic
example of this was the Wimpy fast food chain some years ago, when it was
forced to buy back many franchised outlets because of slipping standards.
Other problems faced by franchisors include the franchisee feeling that
success is due more to his own efforts than that of the franchisor; this can
lead to the franchisee resenting having to make regular royalty payments.
Communications can become a problem, which can lead to conflicting
objectives and less willingness by franchisees to co-operate in the running
and development of the system.
'Most of these problems arise, however, when the franchisor has not selected
his franchisees with sufficient care,' points out Mr Peter Stern, senior
franchise management with National Westminster Bank. 'Personality,
suitability for the particular franchise, family support and financial
background are all important factors to be considered in this very vital
area of franchise recruitment, and a franchisor delegates his selection
process at his peril.'
Many franchisors admit that their early choice of franchisees had been bad.
A number were unable to resist the temptation to sign up franchisees simply
because the franchise was a new one and the franchisor wanted to get it
operating, with the idea of solving potential problems later on.
Companies that are considering franchising as a means of expansion need to
consider several factors. These include whether there is sufficiently large
market demand for a product or service and whether it can easily be
franchised.
In addition, the franchisor should consider whether or not the product or
service has staying power or whether it would just be a passing fad.
Would-be franchisors should be clear whether effective and simple controls
can be established and wether the company has sufficient depth of management
to recruit franchisees and to develop the franchise.
If the answers to these questions are positive, then the prospective
franchisor should go forward with a pilot operation to test the market
formula, prove its viability, highlight problem areas, and perfect the
package by experimenting with opening hours, advertising methods, and so on.
The minimum period for a pilot run should be from six to nine months and it
many cases it would be better to operate several pilot schemes in tandem for
12 months or more.
The British Franchise Association makes it clear that the relationship
between franchisor and franchisee is crucial. 'The skill of the franchisor
in dealing with the franchises throughout the relationship will be a
fundamental factor in the degree of success which he will enjoy,' it says.

FT  04 MAY 91 / Survey of Franchising (4): Gamekeeper turns poacher / Alan
Maidwell a former bank manager with a new niche
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALAN Maidwell is something of a gamekeeper turned poacher. For 20 years he
worked for Midland Bank, latterly as corporate banking manager for the
north-east where he advised many companies throughout Tyneside, Wearside and
Teeside.
When the opportunity to take early retirement - he is 57 - came last year,
he decided to put into practice for himself the business skills he had been
urging on others. 'It was one thing to tell others how to do it but quite
another to demonstrate that I can run a business successfully myself,' he
says.
Mr Maidwell chose to go into a franchised operation far removed from the
popular image of fast-food chains: Pirtek, a franchised distributorship
supplying replacement Pirelli hydraulic hose and fittings to customers in
the Tyneside and Wearside area.
'We are geared to the construction, plant hire and demolition industries
which use an extensive range of hydraulic machinery and equipment,' says Mr
Maidwell. 'We are also increasingly supplying the opencast mining companies
in Northumberland like Taylor Woodrow, Budge and Crouch Mining.'
Other customers include local authorities, who have a range of dustcarts,
grass cutters, gritting machines and even grave digging equipment which use
hydraulics.
The Pirtek franchise was developed in Australia, where it was discovered by
Mr Forbes Petrie, a former director of Prontaprint.
'I was looking for another industry which was as behind the times as the
instant printing business was a decade ago: one in which people competed on
discounts rather than quality and was therefore open to a franchise
operation which gave customers a better service,' he says.
Pirtek concentrates on the profitable parts of the hydraulic business:
supplying the hoses and fittings rather than a whole range of hydraulic
products. 'It certainly isn't the most glamorous business to be in, but we
are the niche specialists in what remains a pretty stable business,' says Mr
Petrie.
Recession has not, so far, dented the business since it was set up two years
ago. 'Paradoxically, we are benefitting from the recession because we
operate a small specialist supply service rather than the mass-market,
commodity type of operation that most hydraulic supply companies are
seeking,' says Mr Petrie.
Pirtek's franchise operations depend on speed and mobility in providing a
customer service: radio-linked vans with spares and engineers can replace
faulty hydraulic hose quickly on site. 'We operate on the just-in-time
concept,' says Mr Maidwell. 'We get there quickly and get the job done so
the machinery can be back in action as fast as possible.'
Mr Maidwell's distributorship cost about Pounds 160,000 to establish -
including stock and three vans - of which he put up Pounds 75,000 from his
own resources. 'To start with we have been making losses, as you would
expect,' he says. 'But we hope to be in a break-even situation soon and into
profits after that. Obviously it is very competitive in the north-east at
the moment because of the recession, but I believe we have the edge with the
speed and quality of our service.'
Mr Petrie, who has set up nine franchised distributorships so far in the UK,
recalls his reaction when first approached by Mr Maidwell: 'You can imagine
my surprise when the bank manager said he wanted to come and see me. I
thought he was going to moan about how our account was being run, not that
he wanted to buy a franchise]'

FT  04 MAY 91 / Survey of Franchising (1): Pressure on new recruits - It has
been said that a franchise provides additional safeguards over and above
those available to the independent start-up business. The recession is
providing the industry with the opportunity to show that it really is the
safer way to start in business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE recession has presented the franchising industry with an ideal
opportunity to show whether it really is the safer way to start in business
that its proponents assert. Impressive claims have been made in the past for
the additional safeguards that a franchise provides over and above those
available to the independent start-up business.
The signs are that franchising does succeed in reducing failure rates though
not by the margins claimed in some of the wilder estimates.
At present, 5-6 per cent of franchisees go out of business because of
financial difficulties each year, according to Mr Peter Stern, senior
franchise manager of National Westminster Bank. This suggests a slightly
better success rate than for small businesses generally, 40 per cent of
which can expect to survive their first 10 years.
Apollo Blinds, a company with one company-managed store and 96 franchised
outlets has experienced three failures as a result of the recession. Two
were recent recruits to the Apollo franchise with underfunding and 'the
quality of the people' factors in their demise, according to Mr James
Watson, franchise director at the company.
Franchised businesses held up better than managed outlets in the early
stages of the present recession, says Mr Brian Smart, director of the
British Franchise Association (BFA), representing 136 franchisors.
Franchised businesses responded more quickly by increasing their marketing
and by cutting costs but those which depend on the public's discretionary
spending face tougher times.
The franchising industry is more concerned at the pressure which the
economic downturn exerts on the recruitment of new franchisees. Fewer people
are prepared to take out a large bank loan at a time of high interest rates
to launch themselves into business - whether franchised or not.
On the plus side, for the franchise industry at least, is the prospect of
further increases in unemployment. The present round of job cuts is
affecting far more white collar workers than the 1981 recession and these
are the people the franchisors are most keen to sign up.
'These people are the ones with business aspirations,' says Mr David
Acheson, managing director of Stoy Hayward Franchising Services.
As part of a long-term attempt to increase the number of new franchisees the
BFA is considering establishing a permanent franchising centre in the London
area, backed by three or four provincial outposts, to provide information
and advice. At present, the industry markets itself by means of an annual
round of conferences and seminars.
A further bonus from the recession is that it is persuading some businesses,
in the retail sector in particular, to consider franchising as a way of
relieving pressure on their finances.
However, this defensive approach to franchising cannot be seen as a quick
fix. Franchisors must realise they are taking on a long-term commitment to
their franchisees, Mr Acheson warns.
In spite of the economic problems the franchise industry is confident of
continuing growth throughout the 1990s. Mr Stern expects franchised turnover
to rise by a further 10-15 per cent in the year ending June 1991 compared
with the 11 per cent increase, to Pounds 5.24bn, in the year ended June
1990. The BFA is forecasting further increases to Pounds 12.5bn by 1995.
Franchising in the UK comprised 379 franchisors or franchised systems last
year (28 per cent up on 1989). They had signed up 18,260 franchisees (10 per
cent up) who directly employed 183,600 people (nearly 1 per cent down). The
BFA calculates that franchising accounts for 5.5 per cent of the domestic
services sector and 1.4 per cent of the retail sector.
Franchising is growing faster in the UK than in the US, traditional home of
this business formula, though the scale of the industry in the US continues
to dwarf that in the UK. Franchised sales in the US are Dollars 759m and
account for about one-third of retail turnover.
Franchising may only have begun to establish itself in the UK as a
significant force in the past 10 years but as a general concept it has a
long history. In its most basic form it goes back to the Middle Ages when
the sovereign granted barons a franchise to collect taxes in return for
services such as the provision of soldiers for an army.
The Singer Sewing Machine company franchised out the right to sell and
service its equipment to independent operators in the mid-19th century in
the US and similar arrangements were adopted by the motor manufacturers and
soft drinks bottlers. It was not until the 1950s that franchising was
applied as a distinct way of starting up a new business as opposed to merely
being a way of distributing an existing product, according to Mr John
Stanworth and Mr Brian Smith, authors of the Barclays Guide to Franchising
for the Small Business.
To distinguish franchising proper from licensing, agency, distribution and
tenancy agreements it is usually referred to as business format franchising.
The franchisor signs a contract with the franchisee allowing him to use his
brand name or trademark and his established method of trading as a way of
going into business.
The franchisor provides training and marketing support in return for a
down-payment for the franchise, a share in turnover or profits, and a
commitment to maintain the franchisor's quality standards. The franchisee is
frequently required to buy his raw materials from the franchisor.
The franchisee benefits by taking on an established product and by being
able to call on the expertise of the franchisor. The franchisor, in turn,
can expand his business more rapidly because his franchisees are sharing the
financial burden.
Fast food outlets and instant printing shops are frequently regarded as the
most common forms of franchised businesses but in terms of turnover the
three largest sectors in the UK are business services (excluding print) with
23 per cent of the total franchising market, home improvements with 13 per
cent and property maintenance with 9 per cent.
Financial services such as insurance broking and estate agencies have
started taking a growing share of the market. The brewers, who have long
made use of their system of tied houses are starting to turn to fully
fledged franchising. Dairy Crest is starting to convert its milk rounds into
franchises while plans are afoot to franchise main post offices and even an
ambulance service.
The increasing popularity of franchising is dependent in no small part on
the efforts of the industry to improve its own standards of control and
ethics. Franchising suffered in the 1960s from its association with pyramid
selling while the failure in the mid-1980s of Young's Franchise Group (which
subsequently went on to trade normally under new owners) dented confidence
in the ability of the industry to police itself.
Over the past two years the BFA has begun a programme to tighten up on its
controls and from this year members will be required to seek
re-accreditation annually. Would-be members will have to provide detailed
information about their businesses to prove their viability.
Mr Smart does not expect this process to lead to members being struck off,
though he concedes that one or two may withdraw voluntarily. Some members
may have to modify the contracts they present to their franchisees to bring
them up to date with the latest European and UK thinking.
'We are not trying to catch people out,' says Mr Smart. 'What we want to do
is to promote change.'

FT  03 MAY 91 / T&amp;N seeks Pounds 119m to reduce debt and modernise plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
T&amp;N, the UK automotive components and general engineering group, is raising
Pounds 119m (Dollars 204m) to reduce debt and fund its modernisation
programme, as well as cutting a further 2,500 jobs.
The money will be raised in a one-for-four rights issue at 140p a share.
This comes little more than a year after a Pounds 127m, one-for-three cash
call at 150p, which was related to the Dollars 190m acquisition of JP
Industries, the US automotive parts maker.
JPI brought in Dollars 176m debt, which drove up T&amp;N's borrowings to Pounds
248m by last December, giving debt-equity gearing of 49 per cent. Mr Colin
Hope, chairman, said one reason for the issue announced yesterday was to
reduce that ratio to less than 30 per cent.
Some market disappointment at the move was reflected in an 11p fall in the
share price to 163p.
The job losses follow cuts of 1,800 last year and will bring T&amp;N's total
workforce down from 42,000 in December to fewer than 40,000. When the group
announced its 1990 results in March, it provided for another 600
redundancies this year, but warned that the cuts were an ongoing process.
Mr Hope said the brunt of the cuts would again be in the UK, where T&amp;N has
16,000 workers, and on the automotive side. Over two years, redundancies
would cost the group about Pounds 21m.
As UK component suppliers have had their margins squeezed by sharp falls in
sales volumes, the 'big six' (Lucas Industries, GKN, Pilkington, BBA, T&amp;N
and BTR) have shaken out about 5,000 jobs over the past 12 months. Warnings
had already been issued that 1991 would see several thousand more disappear.
Mr Hope said the labour cuts, spread over 150 factories in several
countries, were also the consequence of investment in more efficient plant.
Capital spending would be kept at more than Pounds 80m this year, compared
with Pounds 89m in 1990. 'We want to maintain our investment programme and
keep a sound balance sheet,' he said.
He warned that the first-half results would be well below the Pounds 46.1m
pre-tax recorded in last year's interims. They would be more like the second
half of last year, when the taxable amount fell to Pounds 24.4m and earnings
per share were little more than 4p.
With interest costs rising to Pounds 15.6m in that half and an interim
dividend of 3.6p to try to match, Mr Hope agreed there had been some concern
about ratios other than the gearing.
The board did, however, declare its intention to maintain the total dividend
for 1991 at 10.85p. Mr Hope expected a second-half improvement as the
benefit of lower costs came through and demand began to pick up.
Last year, when T&amp;N's pre-tax profit fell 16 per cent to Pounds 70.5m on
sales of Pounds 1.25bn, sharp declines were registered in continental Europe
as well as in the UK. T&amp;N is more exposed to Fiat, Renault and Peugeot in
Italy and France than to the busier German makers. Mr Hope said while the UK
deteriorated further, France and Italy had improved a little.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Garcia rejects allegations of corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOBODY in Peru arouses such intense political passions as former president
Alan Garcia, writes Sally Bowen in Lima. So allegations against him of
massive corruption, unveiled last week in the country's congress, have all
the makings of a long-running political drama. Mr Garcia is alleged to have
deposited some Dollars 50m in foreign bank accounts during his five-year
presidency, which ended last July after the victory of Mr Alberto Fujimori.
Mr Garcia called the allegations 'a scandalous fabrication,' and warned that
they would prove to be a 'political boomerang'.
Mr Fernando Olivera, the deputy heading the parliamentary commission which
has been investigating relatively minor discrepancies in Mr Garcia's
declared income and house purchases, made the allegations before a full
congressional session. He read reports from two North American investigation
services.
One of the investigators, Kroll Associates, has a track-record of probing
the finances of dictators such as Panama's General Manuel Antonio Noriega,
the late Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, and Iraq's President Saddam
Hussein. Their preliminary report on Mr Garcia alleges the existence of an
account in his name at a now-defunct savings and loan in Dallas, Texas. Larc
Investigative Services of Miami gives alleged details of 'several six-figure
deposits (totalling approximately Dollars 50m) made between 1986 and 1989,'
apparently in Mr Garcia's wife's name. Funds were subsequently transferred
to various international financial institutions, it claims. Mr Garcia calls
the charges an 'irresponsible and delinquent' attempt by the right 'to teach
a lesson to the man who confronted the banking system. Why don't they just
kill me once and for all?' The ex-President and his wife have legally
empowered the presidents of the congress and supreme court to gain access to
any bank accounts in their names and to withdraw any funds discovered.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Victoria woos mining companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STATE of Victoria failed to reach its full potential during Australia's
gold rush in the 1980s  - when the country's annual output jumped from 17 to
about 200 tonnes  - mainly because of its reputation as a place to be
avoided by mining and exploration companies.
This was suggested yesterday by Mr Keith Bowen, general manager project
facilitation for Victoria's Department of Manufacturing and Industry
Development, who recalled that the state was Australia's leading gold
producer in the late 1800s.
Mr Bowen is part of a team in Europe trying to attract mining and
down-stream processing companies to Victoria after its new Mining Act which
comes into effect in July. The Act is completely new, not a revision or
amendment, and has been designed 'to foster and encourage the mining
industry', he said.
Victoria's mineral production, including petroleum, coal and quarry
products, last year was worth about ADollars 5bn. After these three items,
gold was the most valuable, with output of 75,000 troy ounces worth ADollars
33m, followed by koalin, ADollars 13.4m; other clays ADollars 7.2m; and
glass sand Dollars 3.9m.
Mr Bowen said Victoria had one of the world's most economically important
areas in the Latrobe Valley which contained about 4bn barrels of oil, 14
trillion cubic feet of gas and 30bn tonnes of readily winnable brown coal.
The state currently produced no base metals in spite of being on the same
geological formation from which metals were being mined in Tasmania and New
South Wales.
Victoria's low-cost energy made it an attractive location for
energy-intensive mineral processing activities, such as the aluminium
smelting at Point Henry and Portland. The state hoped to attract companies
to upgrade mineral sands, to produce magnesium, to smelt nickel, fuse
minerals and make specialised ceramic materials.

FT  03 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Moody's downgrades three
Japanese banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOODY'S Investor Service yesterday lowered the senior debt ratings of three
Japanese trust banks, Mitsubishi Trust, Sumitomo Trust and Toyo Trust, and
placed under review the rating of a fourth, Yasuda Trust and Banking.
It said that Japanese trust banks were under 'greater than average
pressures' from financial liberalisation in Japan, and suggested that the
banks' exposure to real estate developers is 'significant.'
Mitsubishi Trust and Sumitomo Trust were downgraded from A1 to Aa2, while
Toyo Trust was downgraded from A1 to Aa3, because, the agency said, the
banks' trust activities are 'vulnerable both to intensifying competition and
to a volatile market'.
The agency said that the three banks' capital adequacy ratios could fall,
but emphasised that all three 'remain strong' and have 'a loyal base of
customers'.
Moodys also downgraded the senior debt ratings of the banks guaranteed
subsidiaries, Mitsubishi Trust Finance (Asia), Mitsubishi Trust Australia,
Sumitomo Trust Finance (HK) and Toyo Trust (Australia).
Yasuda Trusts' A1 rating was placed under review, the agency said, because
of a slowdown in 'earnings momentum' and 'banks' vulnerability to
deterioration in the domestic and overseas real estate markets'.
Japanese trust banks reported significant losses on stock holdings with the
plunge in the Tokyo market last year, and were hurt by the surge in interest
rates and a weak bond market.
The leading trust banks are expected to report 50 per cent falls in
operating profit in the year to end March.

HORSHAM, the Canadian holding company, expects to buy the 40 per cent
minority holding in Clark Oil and Refining from St Louis oil trader Mr Tony
Novelly, according to Horsham's chairman, Mr Peter Munk, writes Robert
Gibbens in Montreal.
Horsham is controlled by Mr Munk, who in turn controls American Barrick
Resources. In 1988, Horsham paid USDollars 454m for 60 per cent of Clark,
which operates two refineries and 1,000 retail outlets in the US mid-west.
Clark contributed USDollars 4.9bn to Horsham's first-quarter profits of
USDollars 13.3m, or 15 cents a share. A year earlier, Horsham took a
USDollars 3m loss on its Clark investment, showing total earnings of
USDollars 2.4m, or 3 cents a share.
Clark's refining margins doubled to USDollars 4.90 a barrel in the first
quarter and the company successfully hedged against sharp falls in crude and
petroleum product prices last January.
Upgrading Clark's refining and marketing operations will cost USDollars 150m
over the next two or three years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MCCAW Cellular Commun -ications, the leading company in the fast-growing US
cellular telephone market, reported a first-quarter net loss of Dollars
169.1m, but said it was producing continued growth in revenue, cash flow and
numbers of subscribers.
The company, in which British Telecom has a stake of around 20 per cent, has
assumed large debts to fund its rapid expansion and its bottom line results
are expected to remain in the red for a considerable time to come.
The first-quarter loss, which translated into a per share figure of 97
cents, compared with net income of Dollars 851.9m, or Dollars 4.93 a share,
in the first quarter of last year. However, that profit was due to its
Dollars 1.2bn sale of south-eastern US markets to rival Contel.
McCaw said comparisons between the two periods were also affected by the
increased interest expense incurred in last year's takeover of 52 per cent
of Lin Broadcasting, another large cellular company, and the acquisition of
Metromedia's interest in the New York cellular licence. Lin's results have
been consolidated since March 5 last year.
McCaw said its first-quarter revenues rose 56 per cent to Dollars 293.4m,
while cash flow increased from Dollars 36.2m to Dollars 89.5m and the number
of McCaw/Lin cellular subscribers rose 47 per cent to 1.26m.
Income from operations was Dollars 800,000 against a loss of Dollars 16.5m.

FT  03 MAY 91 / World Trade News: UK exports to Gulf states down by 14% last
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH exports to the six Arab Gulf states fell 14 per cent last year,
largely because of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. But improved UK performance
in North Africa and Iran helped limit the decline of UK exports to the
Middle East to 5 per cent overall.
In its latest analysis of trade figures, the government-sponsored Committee
for Middle East Trade (Comet) said Britain still lagged behind Germany, the
US, France and Italy in the region, but was ahead of Japan. UK exports to
the Middle East fell to Pounds 5.66bn from Pounds 5.95bn in 1989. Of this
Pounds 3.24bn came from the six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council.
Apart from Iraq and Kuwait, only Algeria, Bahrain, Oman and Saudi Arabia cut
their UK imports in 1990, but some markets were registering sharp falls
early this year.
Comet said: 'Given the loss of Kuwait and Iraq as export markets from August
1990, the drop is not as severe as might have been expected.' A 20.5 per
cent fall to Pounds 1.93bn in UK exports to the vital Saudi Arabian market
last year, could not all be blamed on the Gulf crisis and could have been
affected by fluctuating deliveries of Tornado aircraft.
Britain's performance in Morocco and Tunisia was encouraging. Some exporters
to Algeria had problems with banks refusing to confirm letters of credit
because of payment delays, but windfall hydrocarbon revenues seem to have
been used to clear the arrears.
France and Italy both performed well in the Maghreb, while Britain was
unable to match the generous credit terms offered by its competitors.
Improved UK links with Iran seem to be bearing fruit. Iran imported Pounds
393m of British goods last year, a rise of 53 per cent on 1989, and became
Britain's fourth biggest Middle East market.

FT  03 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Steady advance inspired by Wall St
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A STEADY advance in London share prices yesterday was inspired by Wall
Street's good performance overnight and, to a lesser extent, by the start of
the new session as well. Domestically minded investors waited for the
results of UK local elections and found little direction from a mixed bag of
corporate news.
The market shrugged off the latest in the series of rights issues. The
Pounds 119m cash call from engineer T &amp; N surprised sector specialists.
Market strategists see more on the way. They reiterated their view that the
stream of rights issues - worth Pounds 1.1bn in April and more than Pounds
300m in the first two days of May - would be a drag on share prices.
Such cash as was being invested in the UK was directed primarily into the
less speculative sectors, such as food retailers, utilities and banks.
Better than expected results from Wellcome triggered heavy buying of the
stock and made it the sharpest riser of the day in the Footsie.
Mr Richard Kersley at BZW saw the interest in retailers as more than just a
response to the Appeal Court ruling earlier in the week which opened the way
for more shops to open on Sundays. He said it also reflected a conviction
that when the economic recovery came it would be consumer-led. Its scale
would still be modest, however, perhaps half that of the growth in
consumption in the late-1980s, widely seen to have stoked up inflationary
pressures at the time.
The interest in defensive vehicles also allowed investors to take into
account the widely divergent views on when recovery would begin in earnest.
Even the most bullish of broking houses sees little recovery in the near
term, and there are several prepared to pencil in the summer of 1992 rather
than the last quarter of 1991.
Analysts were wary of committing themselves on the very short term as well.
County NatWest believes that politics will be the key to sterling and gilts
over the next week. Mr Bob Semple at County said that while yesterday's
local elections would help indicate whether the government had succeeded in
reducing the vote-losing effect of the poll tax, London shares would still
look to New York for inspiration. He added that the US stock market, where
prices already discount a recovery, was more vulnerable to downgradings than
London, especially if US inflation figures came in above expectations.
Today's US employment figures will provide the next test of sentiment.
True to form, the 42-point rise overnight on Wall Street underpinned
London's opening. Hopes for more to come pushed the FT-SE 100 index to a
high for the day, just before Wall Street opened, of 2,539.3.
While US stocks did indeed stage early gains, they were not enough to stave
off scattered selling in London. The Footsie drifted back to end at 2,530.7,
up a net 22.3.
Turnover reached 516.6m, continuing the week's gentle rise. The extra
activity yesterday was said by traders to have been the result of funds
taking the opportunity to sell selectively into the rally. These levels of
trading leave brokerages uncomfortable: turnover is more than 100m shares a
day below the levels seen in the March bull market and barely two-thirds of
the Pounds 1bn a day seen as a profitability benchmark by the City.
The brewery sector was the softest. Aided by bid speculation, it has bucked
the market trend for several days. But such thoughts were forgotten as
attention turned to the more measured rally elsewhere.

FT  03 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome helped by drug sales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME was the best performer of the day among FT-SE 100 stocks in heavy
trading. Investor enthusiasm was triggered by the company's interim results.
In particular, the sales of virus drug Zovirax reminded the market that it
should not see the company as dependent on Aids treatment Retrovir.
Analysts raised their forecasts for full year profits and reiterated buy
recommendations. BZW pointed out the company's increased margins, adding
that they are still below Glaxo's. County NatWest raised its full year
profits estimate from Pounds 345m to Pounds 370m, saying that 'Wellcome is
likely to be among the fastest growing FT-SE stocks in earnings terms over
the next few years'.
Wellcome shares ended at the day's high of 582p for an advance of 63.
Turnover reached 6.1m.
T &amp; N cash call
The second cash call by automotive component and engineering group T &amp; N in
just over a year surprised the market. It was perceived as opportunist, and
not necessitated by the current level of gearing, which is generally seen as
not being too high. The upshot was a fall of 11 in the shares to 163p.
T &amp; N proposes to raise Pounds 119m through a rights issue, having called on
shareholders in March of last year for Pounds 130m. Further job losses were
also announced and the Pounds 7m cost of the rationalisation caused analysts
to lower both profits and earnings per share (eps) forecasts. County NatWest
now expects eps of 12.4p, down from 14.2p.
Allied-Lyons lower
Some of the speculative froth on Allied-Lyons shares yesterday was blown
away by reports that US brewer Anheuser-Busch, one of three rumoured
predators, was not interested in acquiring the UK group. Short-term
operators saw this as a signal to realise profits and reinvest in less
volatile equity leaders.
The resulting sales allowed marketmakers to balance short book positions and
the Allied share price slipped to close 12 down on the session at 561p.
Trading volume was high at 5.4m shares traded.
Allied is expected to report lower annual profits on May 14 owing to foreign
exchange losses of Pounds 150m. Confirmation is also awaited of the early
retirement of both the chairman and chief executive.
BOC lost 5 to 565p as Mr Alastair Nisbet of UBS Philips &amp; Drew changed his
recommendation on the stock from buy to hold and cut his profits forecast
for the current year by Pounds 15m to Pounds 335m. He blamed currency
movements, the recession in Canada and recent poor results from US chemicals
companies for his decisions.
British Gas recovered 2 to 238p on heavy turnover of 10m as some broking
firms took the view that the underperformance of Gas shares both before and
following the acceptance of the Ofgas tariff proposals had gone far enough.
The exploration success in the Gulf of Mexico continued to drive the oil
majors higher, with BP a further 6 up at 357p on 6m. Shell lagged behind,
closing only 2 firmer at 527p, restrained by more hefty selling from
overseas. Turnover in Shell was 6.5m.
The market continued to ponder the chances of Elf and Enterprise engaging in
a joint venture to acquire Occidental's North Sea assets, and then indulging
in an assets swap which would involve Enterprise acquiring Elf's 25 per cent
stake in the UK oil group.
County NatWest, which regards Enterprise as 'good value', said it thought
such a deal unlikely because it would create a large ACT (advance
corporation tax) problem for Enterprise. Kleinwort Benson believed a swap
'might occur', adding that 'if so, Enterprise will be a better balanced
company but its share price will be lower'. Enterprise improved 2 to 561p.
Water shares extended their rally for much of the day but came off the best
levels just before the close, when a series of big trades at prices well
below market levels flashed up on the Seaq delayed ticker.
The late business was thought to have represented more unravelling of the
Water Package units, a trend much in evidence in recent weeks as the market
has taken on board the implications of the cessation of trading in the
Package on July 12.
The late deals included a line of 1.6m Thames Water, traded at 313p (Thames
closed 11 higher at 320p), and a 1.7m line of North West, traded at 296p
(the stock ended 12 stronger at 305p). Earlier in the day a block of 1.7m
South West Water went through the market at 306p; South West settled a net 4
up at 303p. The Water Package, where turnover reached the equivalent of 5m
of the underlying shares, picked up 98 to Pounds 3068.
Much of the improvement in sentiment in the sector has been attributed to
switching out of stocks such as British Gas into the waters. And water share
prices are now thought to discount a poor performance by the Conservatives
in yesterday's local elections.
Hoare Govett issued a note on the entire utilities area, highlighting the
exposure to political, regulatory and environmental risks. County NatWest,
however, pointed out that the performance of the water issues in April was
not as grim as daily price movements implied. Over the month the sector
index showed a marginal rise while the equity market was broadly unchanged.
County said that the run-up to an autumn general election should be smooth;
at current levels the sector is looking oversold.
There was strong activity in the banks, where switching operations and
straight buying, both domestic and overseas, was sharply focused on NatWest,
which advanced 11 to 340p on heavy volume. Lloyds also saw big turnover but
the shares underperformed, ending only 2 up on the session at 337p.
The fall-out from Allied-Lyons brought the good run in Bass to a halt and
the stock closed 17 easier at 982p. Grand Metropolitan, on the other hand,
warmed to dollar influences and rose 9 to 821p, while clearance of a line of
stock overhanging the market put Guinness up 10 to 918p. The latter is James
Capel's star buy for May.
Ratners fell 12 1/2 to 165 1/2 p as reports began to filter back from
analysts visiting its US operations. The suggestion was that US sales had
not picked up as strongly as had been hoped following the end of the Gulf
war.
Turnover in Tesco swelled to 22m shares as the company bought 7.3m for its
employee profit sharing scheme. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew paid institutions 297p
per share and Tesco closed 9 higher at 296p. Kwik Save rose 5 to 592p on
indications that Aldi, the German discount supermarket group, may now be
looking towards markets in eastern Germany, rather than the UK, where it
recently established a foothold.
A two-way pull developed in Asda, which added 1 1/2 at 122 1/2 p on 11m, as
some institutions continued to reduce their holdings following the profits
downgrades and reports of weak trading. Other investors were buyers on the
basis of the shares' recent underperformance. Argyll rose 11 to 316p on
signs of switching from Tesco.
Several broking houses lowered profits forecasts for automotive components
group GKN and this exerted pressure on the shares, which weakened 6 to 361p.
Bletchley Motor, the multi-franchised distributor, went 10 higher to 90p on
a buy recommendation from Kleinwort Benson. Analyst Mr Jeremy Allen said the
shares were standing at a 'significant discount' to the sector average, have
a high yield of over 13 per cent and an attractive asset backing of 205p per
share.
Coats Viyella was well supported, and as the price rose so the values of its
all-paper and mixture of cash and shares offers for Tootal were enhanced.
Coats settled 6 higher at 148p and Tootal a penny firmer at 85p.
The recent run in Flexello Castors &amp; Wheels was abruptly reversed by the
warning that the interim results would be significantly worse than those of
last year. To strengthen the company's financial and commercial position,
discussions are taking place which might lead to an offer being made. The
shares finished 12 down at 97p.
Land Securities retreated 10 to 519p on 2.2m on worries that it may report a
larger than expected fall in net asset value in its final results due later
this month. Some brokers have already lowered their forecasts to around 685p
per share, against 867p last time.

FT  03 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Insurers grab spotlight as
rally slackens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
THE STOCK market continued to claw back its recent losses yesterday, but
late profit-taking and computerised sell programmes more than halved the
early session gain, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 8.41 higher at 2,938.61,
having been almost 20 points ahead initially. The broader-based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 ended a marginal 0.24 firmer at 380.53. The Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks, with the help of a rally in technology issues,
outperformed the other indices, finishing up 3.28 at 491.13.
Turnover on the New York SE was a moderate 187m shares, while rises
outnumbered falls by 948 to 612.
The market is still drawing strength from Tuesday's discount rate cut and
the subsequent prime rate reductions by the big money centre banks.
Investors, who had been worried by the depth and length of the recession,
are buying stocks in the hope that lower borrowing costs will stimulate
business activity and bring the economy out of its slump well before the end
of the year.
The insurance sector grabbed the spotlight as some of the biggest groups
reported first-quarter earnings. USF&amp;G put on Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 11 3/8
in spite of unveiling a consolidated net loss of Dollars 55m in the period,
against a profit of Dollars 51m at the same stage in 1990.
AIG shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 90 3/8 after reporting a modest increase in
net income to Dollars 375.4m, from Dollars 355.7m a year ago. General
Reinsurance, down Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 90 1/4 , revealed just a 2 per
cent rise in net income to Dollars 150.4m, from the first quarter of 1990.
Banks were mixed in the wake of lower interest rates. BankAmerica stood out
with a rise of Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 39 5/8 .
Mesa Airlines advanced Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 14 3/4 and Atlantic
Southeast Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 29 1/2 on the secondary market following
a buy recommendation from securities house Kidder Peabody. Delta Airlines,
quoted on the NYSE, gained Dollars 2 to Dollars 74 in sympathy.
Amgen jumped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 133 3/4 on turnover of 1.7m after
surprising analysts with fiscal fourth-quarter net income of 78 cents a
share, well up on the 18 cents earned in the corresponding period. Another
drug company, Synergen, added Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 29 1/2 on news that
phase two trials have begun on its septic shock drug.
Duracell, taken private nearly three years ago in a leveraged buy-out,
returned to the market yesterday, with investors snapping up the stock. Just
over 20m shares, or two-thirds of the issue, had changed hands by the close,
with the price ending at Dollars 20 3/4 , up nearly 40 per cent from its
offer price of Dollars 15.
Over-the-counter technology stocks closed higher, with Apple recovering from
recent losses to gain Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 49 and Sun Microsystems
putting on Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 36 7/8 on 1.5m turnover.
Canada
SOME disappointing first-quarter results restrained the Toronto market,
which ended with just a slightly firmer bias after Wednesday's enthusiasm
over the cut in interest rates. Attention is now focused on today's US
report on April employment.
The composite index edged up 7.9 to 3,500.9 and advances led declines by 267
to 260 after volume of 20.5m shares.
Hemlo Gold, up CDollars  3/8 at CDollars 8 3/8 , said it is considering
buying all of Noranda's gold assets in exchange for 8,611,410 common shares
of Hemlo, equivalent to about 10 per cent of Hemlo's outstanding shares.
Noranda gained CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 18 1/8 .

FT  03 MAY 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar resumes its advance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR gained support from the German Bundesbank's decision to leave
interest rates unchanged at yesterday's council meeting, but trading was
nervous ahead of today's US employment data for April.
The market expects a rise in the unemployment rate to 7.0 from 6.8 per cent,
although most analysts are looking for a smaller fall in non-farm payrolls
than the March drop of 206,000. If these figures prove correct, with
payrolls falling about 170,000, it will leave the market waiting for further
evidence of economic recovery and for indications that lower interest rates
are having a beneficial impact.
In subdued trading the dollar rose to DM1.7240 from DM1.7060; to Y138.05
from Y137.55; to SFr1.4590 from SFr1.4445; and to FFr5.8325 from FFr5.7725.
On Bank of England figures the dollar's index climbed to 66.2 from 65.5.
Sterling lost ground to the dollar, but improved against its partners in the
European exchange rate mechanism. The pound was weak on Wednesday, when most
European centres were closed for the May Day holiday, but it picked up
yesterday to finish fourth strongest in the ERM, according to figures from
the European Commission.
Trading was cautious ahead of the local government election results in
England and Wales. Dealers expected the Conservative party to perform
relatively badly in the elections, but it was not clear whether this would
have a detrimental effect on sterling.
The results are likely to have an influence on the timing of the next
general election, and if the ruling Conservatives lose ground at the local
level it will not encourage Mr John Major, the prime minister, to hold an
early general election.
This will reduce some of the political risk surrounding sterling in the
short term, even though a bad result for the government reduces its options
in the timing of the next election, which must be held by the middle of next
year.
Sterling fell 80 points to Dollars 1.7165 and eased to Y237.00 from Y237.25,
but rose to DM2.9600 from DM2.9425; to FFr10.0125 from FFr9.9550; and to
SFr2.5050 from SFr2.4900. Its index lost 0.2 to 91.4. In New York the pound
regained 27 points to end at Dollars 1.7192.
The D-Mark showed mixed changes after the Bundesbank council refrained from
tightening its monetary stance. The economic and political situation in
Germany and the Soviet Union continued to weigh on the currency, but there
was little real expectation of higher German rates yesterday.
In terms of the yen the D-Mark slipped to Y80.05 from Y80.60, but it rose to
L741.00 from L738.10 against the Italian currency at the Milan fixing. The
Bank of Italy sold Dollars 27m as the dollar was fixed higher.
In Paris the D-Mark firmed to FFr3.3852 from FFr3.3775 at the fixing. The
French franc remained the weakest member of the ERM and the Spanish peseta
stayed the strongest currency in the system.

FT  03 MAY 91 / The Property Market: Recession shows eerie similarities to
1970s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS the severity of this property collapse becomes increasingly apparent,
comparisons are being made with the 1970s crash, writes Vanessa Houlder.
'The similarities between 1972-74 and 1988-91 are immense,' says Savills,
the surveying firm.
'Setting the last five years against the boom and slump of the 1970s, the
profile of returns since 1985 has been uncannily similar; a three-year
upswing to peak at 30 per cent, followed by a precipitous drop,' says the
Investment Property Databank, a research body.
Some parallels are striking. In both cases, a credit boom fuelled some heady
years of growth, which led to a sharp hike in interest rates and a recession
exacerbated by international pressures.
In some respects, the crash of the 1970s was far worse than that of the
1990s (so far). 'In the first year of the 1970s slump, rising yields knocked
a third off real capital values; and a further 10 per cent in the following
year,' according to IPD. 'Bad as we think it is, the yield shift of 1989-90
is not this sharp'.
The knock-on effect on the banks has been less severe. Whereas the 1970s
crash triggered a secondary banking crisis, this time banks appear more
resilient and property lending accounts for a smaller proportion of their
loan books.
Furthermore, the large property companies, some of which went close to the
brink in 1974, now have far stronger balance sheets. So far, receiverships
have been far fewer than the first half of 1974.
In addition, the economy was in worse shape in the 1970s putting more
pressure on rents than is expected this time. 'Our current assessment is
that rent growth in the early 1990s will be more favourable than that from
1975 to 1978, especially in real terms, because the recession is expected to
be briefer and shallower,' says IPD.
That said, many in the property industry are experiencing harder times than
in the 1970s. 'Never can I think of a time when conditions have been so
adverse for property investment and development,' says Sir Nigel Mobbs, one
of the industry's most experienced figures.
The scale of overborrowing and overbuilding in the industry at present
dwarfs anything seen before.
The more manageable inflation problem of the 1990s is perhaps a mixed
blessing. Although it signified a far greater malaise in the economy in the
1970s, it also helped to get the developers off the hook thanks to its
effect on real interest rates and the replacement costs on building. It may
take some time before building costs equal those incurred in the heat of the
construction boom.
Perhaps the most worrying feature of the industry's current predicament is
that there are few obvious buyers of the property overhanging the market. In
the 1970s, it took four years for the surplus property to be absorbed. There
is every chance it will take even longer this time.

FT  03 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Trinkaus operating profits
climb 30%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHARINE CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUSSELDORF
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PARTIAL operating profits at Trinkaus &amp; Burckhardt, the Dusseldorf-based
bank controlled by Midland Bank of the UK, rose 7.9 per cent last year to
DM80.8m (Dollars 45.6m), with a weak domestic stock market and low turnover
taking the edge off growth in fee generating business writes Katharine
Campbell in Dusseldorf.
Total operating profits, which include gains from the bank's account
trading, rose by more than 30 per cent. However, a large proportion of this
rise is due to profits from business transacted in the two previous years,
Mr Herbert Jacobi, senior managing partner, said.
Following German accounting conventions, profits arising from interest rate
and equity warrant transactions are not booked when the bank takes in its
fees, but rather when the warrants mature, typically between one and two
years after they are issued. This occurs although Trinkaus hedges its
positions and runs only a minimal credit risk.
As the results show, the bank continues to consolidate its position as a
leading provider of innovative capital market instruments, often packaged
with derivatives components. With a fifth of its earnings coming from
clients not with the bank five years ago, the bank says its ability to
provide the range of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives has been
a selling point.

FT  03 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Credit Suisse in plan to sell
up to 20% of shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DULLFORCE

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO 20 per cent of the shares of Credit Suisse, Switzerland's
third-biggest bank, may be sold to the public as part of a wide-ranging
capital-raising exercise by CS Holding, its parent company.
Mr Rainer Gut, CS Holding's chairman, announced the move at the same time as
revealing a fall of 78 per cent in consolidated earnings to SFr192m (Dollars
129.7m) for 1990.
CSH also revealed a Dollars 587m loss last year by its investment banking
subsidiary CS First Boston, into which it had to inject new capital after
the US operations were caught with a Dollars 1bn exposure in doubtful bridge
loans.
CSH owns more than 99 per cent of Credit Suisse.
The Swiss bank's shares were converted into CSH stock when the group adopted
a holding company structure in 1989. This structure has since been
challenged by the Federal Banking Commission.
Analysts had expected an increase in CSH's capitalisation. However, the
re-opening of Credit Suisse stock to the public - which would mean a
relisting of the bank's shares - appeared to be a bold reaction, typical of
CSH's forceful chairman.
Mr Gut said the size, timing and pricing of a Credit Suisse share offer
would depend on market conditions.
Shareholders will be offered a bonus option. Under this, 20 options from
registered or bearer shares will carry an entitlement to subscribe to one
registered or bearer share.
The terms will be announced before the annual meeting on May 22.
CSH is also considering placing subordinated loans up to the 25 per cent
limit allowed by Swiss banking law. The loans would be offered to foreign
investors, Mr Gut said.
CSH parent company net profit for the year ending March 31 fell by SFr135m,
or 29 per cent, to SFr324m.
The board proposes to reduce the shareholders' dividend from SFr110 to SFr75
per bearer share and from SFr22 to SFr15 per registered share.
CSH's 1990 performance was determined by what Mr Peter Kupfer, executive
board member, called CS First Boston's 'catastrophic' year and the 31 per
cent slide in net earnings and dividend cut at Credit Suisse.
The Swiss bank provides more than 80 per cent of the parent company's
dividend income.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Government Bonds: Treasuries firm as data puts supply in the
shade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US government bonds firmed across the yield curve yesterday as retail demand
and a rise in the jobless total counteracted the weakening influence of next
week's injection of fresh supply by the Treasury.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  15/32 at 97
3/16 , yielding 8.120 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up  1/16
at 100 13/32 , carrying a yield of 6.761 per cent. Trading activity was said
to be very light.
The important statistics of the day came from the Labor Department, which
revealed a 61,000 increase in the number receiving state unemployment
benefits in the week that ended April 13. Although the rise was expected, it
confirmed the view that the employment picture throughout the US is bleak,
and suggests that next Friday's unemployment rate for April will rise from
6.8 per cent to 7 per cent.
If it were not for the jobless data, bond prices would probably have been
lower yesterday because of apprehension ahead the Treasury refunding
offering due next week which, at Dollars 37bn, is the largest ever seen.
Federal funds were trading at 5 3/4 per cent late yesterday morning, in line
with the new target set by Federal Reserve on Tuesday when the discount rate
was also cut.
YESTERDAY'S announcement that the Bundesbank will issue a new Federal bond
next week met with little cheer. German government bond prices fell during
the day as investors moved out of the D-Mark into other currencies.
The yield on the benchmark 9 per cent bund due in 2001 rose from 8.31 per
cent to 8.35 per cent.
The federal bond consortium will meet next Tuesday to set the terms of the
new bund issue. Traders expect the Bundesbank to issue between DM6 and
DM10bn of 10-year paper with a coupon of about 8 1/4 per cent.
One portion of the new issue will be sold through the consortium, and a
second will be auctioned on Wednesday, traders said.
There were no new federal bund issues in March or April, and traders believe
that the Bundesbank may find it difficult to place the new May issue. The
market is worried by the Bundesbank's need to borrow heavily in the bond
market following reunification.
Traders said that the recent widening of spreads between German bunds and
Dutch government bonds has encouraged investors to switch from GerThe spread
between the markets at the 10-year maturity has widened from 21 basis points
last week to 28 basis points on Wednesday and 25 basis points yesterday.
JAPANESE government bond prices firmed on hopes that the Bank of Japan would
cut the Official Discount Rate shortly.
The yield on the benchmark government bond issue No 129 opened at 6.645 per
cent in Tokyo and traded between 6.635 per cent and 6.66 per cent.
UK gilts rose in the morning but slipped back in the afternoon to finish
unchanged.
A combination of local election jitters and disappointment with the German
government bond market caused gilts to fall back after lunch. The benchmark
11 3/4 gilt maturing in 2003/07 fell to its opening price of 110 1/2 to
yield 10.184 per cent.

MEXICO'S Ministry of Finance has announced that the next four of the
country's state-controlled banks to be privatised will be Banamex, Confia,
Banco Oriente and Bancreser.
Banamex is Mexico's largest bank, and the government was originally expected
to wait until the end of the year before selling it.
The bank has over 750 branches, 30,000 employees and Dollars 18.5bn of
assets. On the basis of the 30 per cent of the bank's equity traded on the
bolsa, it is worth over Dollars 2.5bn.
The battle for control of the bank is expected to be between Mr Roberto
Hernandez, head of Accival, Mexico's biggest and most successful brokerage,
and a syndicate which includes Mr Fernando Senderos, head of Desc, a large
conglomerate, and the brokerage InverMexico. Some 20 per cent of the bank
will be sold to members of the banks regional boards.
The other three banks are small and are unlikely to fetch more than Dollars
250m. Confia, which is profitable, may be bid for by Inverlat, another
brokerage. Bancreser is one of only three of the 18 state-controlled banks
which are fully owned by the government.

FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: Defence cuts push Hughes
Aircraft into diversification
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HUGHES AIRCRAFT, part of General Motors and the leading US defence
electronics company, is resigned to achieving little or no growth in its
military business between now and the mid-1990s.
This is despite expectations in the defence industry that electronics
specialists will be less damaged by declining government spending than
manufacturers of 'platforms' such as airframes.
Mr Michael Smith, Hughes' executive vice-president and chief financial
officer, said yesterday any growth would have to come from civilian sectors,
which last year accounted for barely a fifth of the company's Dollars 7.8bn
sales.
The outlook he presented during an interview was notably pessimistic on US
defence budget prospects but, in contrast to widespread caution in the
industry, bullish about opportunities for diversification making use of
military technology.
'A lot of companies have tried and failed, and we have looked hard at some
of them,' Mr Smith said. Hughes, however, had a much greater breadth of
technology than most other defence manufacturers.
The company plans to reduce its dependence on the military from 78 per cent
last year to 60 or possibly 50 per cent by the middle of the decade. Two
years ago, the figure was around 90 per cent.
Overall sales are expected to grow to about Dollars 10bn, in constant terms,
by 1995, but with military business stagnating at the current level of
Dollars 6bn a year.
Mr Smith said the company expected US spending on defence procurement to
decline more drastically than official forecasts, with annual reductions in
real terms of around 5 per cent 'at least through 1995.'
However, Hughes was well placed to pick up contracts for upgrading existing
equipment.
'After 1992 we think our defence business will actually begin to tick back
up again,' Mr Smith said.
Although its rival, Westinghouse, is supplying the radar for the latest US
fighter project, the Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics F-22, Hughes won the
contract for the aircraft's computer processing system.
Expected to be worth about Dollars 1.5bn, this contract opened up a new
business line, with potential spin-offs in both military and civilian
fields.
Plans for new business outside defence included satellite-based
telecommunications, air traffic control, and avionics and landing aids for
civil aircraft. Expertise in power supplies, derived from Hughes' military
radar business, would be used in electric car development with GM and in
diversification into lighting products.
Hughes also aimed to increase its share of the defence market as more
companies dropped out. Unions at TWA, the highly-indebted carrier, together
with the City of St Louis, TWA's main operating base, have filed a motion
asking the US Department of Transportation to stay its ruling on the sale of
its London Heathrow routes, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
The union-St Louis group has already filed an appeal against the decision,
which permitted TWA to sell its three principal London routes to American
Airlines.

FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: Shares in top Adsteam offshoots
are suspended
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN Stock Exchange yesterday suspended shares in the three top
Adelaide Steamship companies, Adsteam, David Jones and Tooth and Co, pending
further information on the confused position of their proposed
reconstruction.
On Wednesday, Adsteam called off its ambitious ADollars 6bn (USDollars
4.6bn) reconstruction in which the companies were to be merged, stating
there was 'little or no equity' for shareholders.
The merger of these three technically insolvent companies would have brought
together their three-way ownership of the profitable Industrial Equity which
owns Australia's most successful retailer, Woolworths.
The position of the banks, owed ADollars 6bn, and the chairman of the
committee overseeing the proposed merger, Mr David Crawford, of KPMG Peat
Marwick, was still unclear yesterday after strong rumours that Mr Crawford
would take over the group as a court-appointed administrator.
Unconfirmed reports yesterday suggested that the banks were inclined to
return to the merger proposal abandoned the day before by the group.
The suspension of the Adsteam shares, however, shows just how far these
companies have fallen. Last year, when the exchange threatened to suspend
trading in the shares after the group resisted a stock exchange demand for a
consolidated balance sheet, former managing director Mr John Spalvins
threatened to make massive legal claims. The exchange backed away.
Mr Spalvins was 'terminated' by his board in March when the group was
obliged to announce a half-year loss totalling ADollars 3.7bn, mainly
through write-downs in the value of group cost shareholdings.
The dramatic fall from grace of this once powerful industrial conglomerate,
which was Australia's largest food producer and second largest employer, has
been a traumatic experience for the investment community.
The All Ordinaries Index dropped 12.6 points yesterday on the news of the
abandonment of the Adsteam merger plan.
Yet, there would be few Australian investors who would not remember the
rapid rise of Adelaide Steamship under the stewardship of its fresh-faced
chief executive, Mr Spalvins, who transformed the sleepy Adelaide tugboat
operator into a formidable investment company from 1980 onwards.
Mr Spalvins introduced a new philosophy to the Australian corporate sector
as he voraciously acquired under-performing companies and turned them into
cash boxes after selling their assets.
He emerged from the corporate backwater of Adelaide in 1980 to acquire the
upmarket department store chain known as David Jones in an audacious share
market raid.
With the dust barely settled, Mr Spalvins turned his guns on the struggling
brewery group Tooth and Co, which he rapidly acquired before selling the
main brewery assets to rival brewer Carlton and United Breweries.

IN A move which will double its reserves and production, Apache Corporation,
the Denver-based oil exploration and production group, is to buy a domestic
business which owns a number of US-based oil and natural gas producing
properties from Amoco, the fifth largest US oil company, writes Nikki Tait.
The main consideration for the transaction comprises Dollars 515m and two
million shares of Apache. Yesterday, Amoco shares fell Dollars  7/8 at
Dollars 53 3/8 , while Apache rose Dollars 2 at Dollars 15 7/8 .
Apache said that the deal means that oil reserves will increase to about 40
per cent of total reserves, compared with 21 per cent at present.
Apache also claimed that total proven and probable reserves of the
properties were around 133m barrels on an oil equivalent basis. They are
located primarily onshore and close to the Gulf Coast, in the Rocky
Mountains and mid-continent regions, and in the Permian Basin.
The package was said to include interests in wells which produced a daily
average of 28,000 barrels of oil and 117m cubic feet of natural gas last
year.
For the much-larger Amoco, however, the properties represent less than 5 per
cent of proven US reserves on a oil equivalent basis. The company claimed
that the sale formed part of 'an ongoing portfolio management'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOUGH climate facing US insurers on their home territory was amply
demonstrated in first-quarter results from three large companies yesterday.
American International Group, the New York-based group which writes a broad
range of insurance cover, reported net income up to Dollars 375.4m (Pounds
218.7m) from Dollars 355.7m in the three month-period, but with earnings per
share only ahead by 1.7 per cent, at Dollars 1.76.
The company conceded that there were 'continuing difficulties in many
segments of the domestic property-casualty industry', although it remained
more cheerful about the longer-term outlook.
Mr Maurice Greenberg, chairman, said: 'We have sharply curtailed our
exposure in some classes of business where industry results have been
extremely poor, including workers' compensation'. He cited the decision to
stop writing new workers compensation business in Texas - at least
temporarily - as one example.
This, he said, contributed to flat premium growth in the quarter, with
worldwide general insurance premiums written totalling Dollars 2.24bn in the
quarter.
Elsewhere, AIG - which said yesterday that it was part of an 'investment
group' that is considering taking a stake in troubled US mutual insurer,
Equitable Life - reported more encouraging trends. It said that speciality
lines did well, while overseas the general insurance and life insurance
businesses 'had very good results'. Results from the financial services
division were also described as 'excellent'.
The net income figure is scored after realised capital gains of Dollars
23.6m, halved from last time's Dollars 49.2m. Operating income from the
general insurance operations rose by 13.1 per cent, and from the life side
by 12 per cent.
At USF&amp;G, the troubled Baltimore-based composite which is engaged in a major
restructuring and has seen management changes recently, there was a first
quarter net loss of Dollars 55m, against a Dollars 51m profit last time.
However, USF&amp;G said that part of the damage resulted from a further Dollars
21m of restructuring charges, plus Dollars 20m for an unanticipated
involuntary National Workers Reinsurance Pool assessment.
After bearing the brunt of these two charges, the property-casualty side
made a net loss of Dollars 15m.
The life side broke even in the quarter, but there was a small loss from
investment management. The net earnings figure came after nil realised gains
on investments, compared with a Dollars 13m surplus in the previous year.
General Re, meanwhile, saw net income edge upwards from Dollars 147.1m to
Dollars 150.4m in the first quarter. Realised gains increased slightly, from
Dollars 12m to Dollars 15.3m. Earnings per share stood at Dollars 1.70
(Dollars 1.64).
The company, the largest reinsurance company in the US, said that the
reinsurance market had remained competitive, but that it had managed
'moderate expansion', with retentions and pricing remaining stable.

FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: Solitary activist takes on a
giant - A boardroom tussle at Sears, Roebuck
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the right hand corner, the combined boardroom might of retailing and
financial services giant Sears, Roebuck, one of the largest companies in the
US. In the left, the solitary figure of Mr Robert Monks, seasoned
shareholder activist.
A tussle between the two sides over the composition of the Sears, Roebuck
board will come to a head next Thursday when the Chicago-based company holds
its annual meeting. Mr Monks is seeking shareholder support to take up one
of three vacant seats on the Sears, Roebuck board. Sears, Roebuck is
strongly opposing him.
Contested board elections are hardly unusual during the US annual meeting
season: takeover bidders and corporate raiders with large stakes in
companies are increasingly using proxy, or shareholder voting battles, to
exert leverage over managements.
What makes this contest so unusual is the figure of Mr Monks, who owns only
100 shares in Sears, Roebuck and is using the contest as a testing ground
for ideas of the growing US corporate governance movement - the belief that
companies' professional managers should be more accountable to their
shareholders. In particular, Mr Monks' candidacy has focused attention on
the composition of US boards and the methods by which directors are
nominated.
Mr Monks is one of the leading figures in the corporate governance movement,
which includes some of the country's most powerful public pension funds.
Aged 57, and a voluble zealot for the cause, he is a Harvard-educated lawyer
who once headed the US Labor Department's pension programme. In the
mid-1980s, he founded Institutional Shareholder Services, a pioneering
Washington firm that advises pension funds on how to vote their proxies, but
last year he resigned from ISS to set up a new organisation - Institutional
Shareholder Partners. This, he said, would allow him to take a more directly
activist role in pushing shareholder rights issues - and the Sears, Roebuck
campaign is one result.
It comes at a time when Sears, Roebuck is suffering from considerable
shareholder dissatisfaction over its poor financial and share price
performance. The problems centre on its core 104-year-old retailing business
rather than its large financial services operations, which include the
brokerage house Dean Witter Securities. Last summer, the situation was
deemed so serious that Mr Edward Brennan, the group's chairman and chief
executive, resumed direct responsibility for the retailing side and began to
slash costs.
The starting point for Mr Monks' campaign is his observation that the Sears,
Roebuck board - in common with virtually all large US corporations - is a
self-perpetuating body, nominating new directors who are then rubber-stamped
in shareholder elections. He complains that although this passes for
'shareholder democracy,' it does not allow investors to exercise any real
choice and does not produce a board of genuinely independent directors, even
if the nominees come from outside the company.
'So long as an individual 'owes' his membership on a board uniquely to
personal selection by the chief executive officer, he cannot be considered
to be 'independent.''
Applying these principles to the particular case of Sears, Roebuck, Mr Monks
suggests a lack of independent boardroom voices may be related to the
company's 'less than mediocre performance.' His election, he says, would
give the board an independent shareholder perspective and his business
experience - such as the chairmanship of the Boston Company, a financial
services business taken over by Shearson - would allow him to offer ideas
which might help Sears, Roebuck to work better.
For example, he says the company should either reach its target return on
equity or be restructured. These remarks echo suggestions by some critics
that Sears, Roebuck might be better broken up. He also maintains that Mr
Brennan has taken on too many responsibilities for one man and the functions
of chairman and chief executive should be separated.
The Sears, Roebuck viewpoint is very different. The company argues Mr Monks'
primary interest is in using it as a laboratory for his ideas of corporate
governance and his presence on the board would distract it from its central
goal of improving the group's financial performance.
Whatever the merits of the case, the odds seem stacked against Mr Monks. One
reason is an initiative Sears, Roebuck took in March which blunts his
campaign. It announced that it would be strengthening the role of outside
directors, initially by cutting the size of the board from 15 to 10 and
eliminating the seats of four company employees. The only inside director
will now be the Sears, Roebuck chairman.
The smaller number of directors also has the effect, given Sears, Roebuck
voting methods, of making it harder for a candidate such as Mr Monks to win
a contested election.
Mr Monks' limited financial fire power is also a factor. While Sears,
Roebuck has budgeted Dollars 5.5m for the proxy contest, Mr Monks is using
only Dollars 250,000 of his own money and he says this has limited his
ability to reach smaller Sears, Roebuck shareholders. So, too, has the
company's refusal to give him access to its shareholder list - and legal
action it is taking against him to support this action. He also complains
that the tortuous regulations of proxy contests - which the Securities and
Exchange commission is considering reforming - has restricted his ability to
manoeuvre.
The composition of the company's shareholder list will weigh against him.
Some 35 to 40 per cent of its stock is held by institutional investors and
he may pick up a significant protest vote here. For example, the California
Public Employees Retirement System, the largest public pension fund in the
US, has been so dissatisfied with Sears' performance that last January it
send a delegation to demand change from Mr Brennan.
But even institutional backing may not be that forthcoming: Mr George
Reagan, from the large Teachers Retirement System of Texas, expresses some
admiration for Mr Monks, but says he may vote against him because he is
worried about public funds, which are ultimately responsible to politicians,
playing such an activist role in corporate governance. 'Would you want the
(British) prime minister to be running private enterprise?' he asks.
It will be even harder for Mr Monks to win the backing of smaller
shareholders, who hold around 40 per cent of the company's shares, while the
trustees of Sears, Roebuck's employee benefit funds - which own a
particularly large 23 per cent of the company - can be virtually guaranteed
to vote against him.
Mr Monks admits to being a little pessimistic. 'My situation is distinctly a
long shot,' he declares. In the event of victory, he will try to recoup his
expenses from the company, but if he fails, he will be Dollars 250,000 out
of pocket.
Sears, Roebuck suggests that he will have other compensations - immense free
publicity for his business and for a book he has written on corporate
governance, due to be published immediately after the proxy battle.
Mr Monks, wearing the mantle of an idealistic zealot for better corporate
governance, says he hopes his campaign will at least have focused attention
on some important issues.
That it may do, for while the Sears, Roebuck battle seem unlikely to lead to
a rash of such initiatives, it could help focus US investor attention more
closely on the selection of the people running companies  - supposedly in
shareholders' best interests.

THREE more senior executives have resigned from the troubled US operation of
Britain's National Westminster Bank, which is in the throes of a shake-up
aimed at restoring it to profits, writes Martin Dickson in New York.
The three are Mr Brendan Dugan, president and chief executive of National
Westminster USA, the group's banking subsidiary in New York state, and two
of his senior lending officers. The New York bank has suffered a heavy
exposure to the depressed north-eastern property market, including loans to
Mr Donald Trump.
The bank's US operations are being shaken up by Mr John Tugwell, a main
board director from London, who last month took over as chief executive of
National Westminster Bancorp, the group's US holding company, from Mr Bill
Knowles, who resigned in March.
National Westminster Bancorp reported a Dollars 190.9m first-quarter loss
last month, forcing the UK parent to inject Dollars 150m of fresh capital
into the business.
Mr Tugwell is to assume Mr Dugan's duties until a successor is named. Mr
Dugan, aged 43, had been with the bank since 1974 and had headed the New
York unit for the past two years. The other two departures are Mr Allan
Schreiber, 50, and Mr Richard Fitzpatrick, both responsible for areas of
medium-sized lending. The New York bank is NatWest's main US operation,
although it also has substantial interests in New Jersey. Mr Tony Warren, a
senior NatWest executive from London, has been appointed chief operating
officer of the US holding company.
The London bank yesterday filed a 'shelf offering' with the US Securities
and Exchange Commission which would allow it to offer up to Dollars 500m of
American Depositary Shares - paper of a non-US company which wishes to issue
stock in America. The company said the proceeds of the dollar preference
shares would be directed to Natwest USA.

HEMLO Gold Mines will become the gold mining arm of Canadian resources group
Noranda under a share-swap proposal announced yesterday.
Noranda proposes to sell all its gold properties to Hemlo in exchange for
8.6m Hemlo common shares currently worth CDollars 69m (USDollars 60m).
Noranda owns 50.1 per cent of Hemlo's 87.6m shares. Further payments of up
to CDollars 10m are envisaged if the gold price rises.
Hemlo operates the Golden Giant mine in north-west Ontario, one of Canada's
largest and lowest-cost gold producers. However, efforts to diversify have
failed.
Output by Hemlo is expected to be about 440,000 ounces this year. The deal
with Noranda would boost its reserves by about 2.2m ounces.
Properties to be transferred to Hemlo would include 289 exploration sites in
North America, including Noranda's interest in the Silidor mine in Quebec.

CONCEPT, the French computer services company now controlled by Altus
Finance, the finance subsidiary of state-owned Credit Lyonnais, has
announced heavy losses after writing off FFr206m (Dollars 36m) from the
value of its acquisitions.
The company, which plunged into the red last year as it struggled to cope
with the management and financial costs of an ambitious expansion programme,
said it made net losses of FFr563m.
Altus took control of Concept last November, replacing Mr Olivier Spire, the
company's founder, with its own nominee, Mr Eric Blot-Lefevre, and acquiring
45.8 per cent of its capital.
It plans to take this stake up to a majority through a FFr140m capital
increase, but this operation, originally intended for January, has been
suspended because of an investigation into the company by the Commission des
Operations de Bourse (COB), the stock market regulatory authority.
Altus, the former banking arm of the state-owned Thomson defence group, was
transferred to Credit Lyonnais in 1989. It operates independently, however,
doing 'what the Credit Lyonnais cannot do, does not want to do or does not
know how to do,' according to Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, the banking group's
chairman. It specialises in taking over bankrupt or failing businesses such
as Concept with the aim of turning them round. It is leading a consortium
discussing the takeover of the stricken Executive Life insurance company in
California.
On the operating level, Concept said FFr210m of 'non-recurrent' current
expenses had taken it to an operating loss last year of FFr153m.
Concept's debt burden, on which it incurred FFr131m of net financial
expenses last year, has now been trimmed from FFr1.2bn to FFr960m.
Sales of FFr470m in the first quarter were below budget. The company
forecasts full-year sales of FFr2.1bn, against FFr1.9bn last year.

the red

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CS FIRST BOSTON, the New York-based investment banking group, suffered a
Dollars 587m loss last year, according to its Swiss parent CS Holding.
CS First Boston took an extraordinary loss of Dollars 428m on top of an
operating loss of Dollars 159m. It had to set aside some Dollars 300m in
special reserves because of the risk associated with bridge loans to several
highly-leveraged companies.
It had hoped to cover these loans with publicly-placed, high-yield debt, but
was thwarted by the collapse of the US junk bond market.
In November, CS First Boston was recapitalised with a Dollars 300m input
from CSH and Dollars 15m from Metropolitan Life, the US insurance group. The
Swiss holding company now has a 64.2 per cent capital stake and 73.5 per
cent of the voting rights in CS First Boston, making it the first foreign
institution to be a majority owner of a major US investment bank.
CS First Boston managers own 22 per cent of the company, Metropolitan Life's
stake is now 6 per cent, and 7.6 per cent is held by 11 other institutional
investors.
Last year's restructuring at the US end involved the creation of a special
purpose company, in which CSH has a 49 per cent interest, to carry the major
bridge loan exposure. During the first quarter this year, one holding -
First Brands - was sold, bringing in Dollars 93m which was used to reduce
senior debt from Dollars 650m to Dollars 557m.
Total revenue at CS First Boston fell from Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars 905m
last year. The difference includes extraordinary reserves of Dollars 296m
against the bridge loans, partly offset by an extraordinary gain from the
sale of Clariden Bank, a Swiss subsidiary, to CSH.
Mr Rudi Stalder, CS First Boston chief financial officer, said CS First
Boston's operating results only went into the red in the last quarter, when
management were preoccupied with the urgent need to recapitalise the
company.
Competitors had tried to exploit the situation by approaches to both clients
and company staff. Nevertheless, CS First Boston's ability to maintain high
rankings in practically all investment banking league tables showed that
most clients had stayed loyal. Major rating agencies had reconfirmed CS
First Boston's standings after the restructuring.
Long-term capitalisation now stood at Dollars 1.61bn against Dollars 1.78bn
in 1989, while the balance sheet was down from Dollars 46bn to Dollars 38bn,
Mr Stalder said. CS First Boston had been obliged to set aside additional
reserves of Dollars 116m to cover potential cash shortfalls from long-term
commitments for now-unneeded office space.
Results for the first quarter of 1991 had been very good.

FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Boddington presses Devenish on plans for
Redruth brewery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BODDINGTON, the pubs, hotels and healthcare group, yesterday pressed its
Pounds 127.7m bid for JA Devenish with demands for information about the
west country brewer's plans for its loss-making Redruth brewery.
In a letter to Devenish shareholders, Mr Denis Cassidy, Boddington's
chairman, questioned whether the brewery could be sold without an agreement
for the supply of beer to Devenish pubs.
'The terms of any such agreement would be critical to the future performance
of Devenish and it would be a matter of the greatest concern if future
profitability were sacrificed for the sake of short-term gains,' Mr Cassidy
said.
Boddington would have to consider whether to let its offer lapse if Devenish
entered into any supply agreement on unsatisfactory terms.
Mr Cassidy also urged shareholders to seek a full explanation from the
Devenish management about the ownership of its Newquay Steam beer brand.
If Devenish licensed the brand from a British Virgin Islands company, Island
Trading, why had it failed to point this out in previous public documents?
he demanded.
Mr Cassidy asked whether the brand had been registered as a trademark, and
called for details of any royalties or other payments for the brand, and
expenditure on developing and marketing it.
Devenish is expected to make its formal reply to the Boddington bid in a
letter to shareholders today.

Pounds 1.6m

<TEXT>
HUNTLEIGH Technology, the USM-quoted medical equipment manufacturer, lifted
taxable profits from Pounds 936,000 to Pounds 1.62m for the year to
end-December.
The 73 per cent surge was achieved on turnover increased to Pounds 17.44m
(Pounds 14.87m), with more than 75 per cent of sales going abroad.
Mr Julian Schild, finance director, predicted further profit increases.
'With an ageing population and the government under pressure to spend more
on increasingly sophisticated medical equipment we believe we are in a
recession-proof business.'
The healthcare division represents 85 per cent of overall turnover. Earnings
per share expanded by 78 per cent to 12.61p (7.1p).
Net borrowings rose to Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 1.8m), representing 52 per cent
of shareholders funds. Net interest charges increased to Pounds 221,000
(Pounds 184,000).
The increase in debt was due mainly to a heavy capital expenditure programme
of Pounds 2.6m on new factories and machinery. A further Pounds 970,000 was
spent on research and development.
A proposed final dividend of 1.75p lifts the total by 1p to 3p.
Mr Schild said the group would continue to develop and market new products
in medical preventative techniques. It has recently launched a new version
of Flowtron DVT, a pneumatic compression devise to prevent blood clots
developing during surgery.

SAATCHI &amp; SAATCHI, the advertising group which recently completed an
emergency recapitalisation package, has reshuffled senior management at
Backer Spielvogel Bates, one of its main US agencies.
Mr Kenneth Rogers, 44, has been promoted to president and chief operating
officer of Backer. He is replacing Mr Dean Scaros, who has resigned. Mr
Rogers, who was previously responsible for client service as managing
director, now takes control of Backer in the US.
Backer, which is based in New York, is seen as one of the weakest areas in
the Saatchi group after a series of significant account losses. The agency
is estimated to have lost Dollars 230m of business culminating last month in
the loss of its Dollars 110m (Pounds 65m) Miller Lite beer account in March.
Its Dollars 30m Avis car hire account is now up for review.
The promotion of Mr Rogers comes only a month after Backer ended its long
search for a new creative director by bringing in Mr Don Easdon, as
executive creative director, from Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos, a
Boston-based agency.

FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Tender sale of NTL network could raise up
to Pounds 200m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN IS to become the first country to privatise part of its television
transmission network, with the sale by tender of National
Transcommunications (NTL), formerly the Independent Broadcasting Authority's
engineering division.
Analysts believe the sale of NTL, which this year expects to make pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 9m on sales of Pounds 77m, may raise between Pounds
150m and Pounds 200m.
NTL is expected to become one of the first new entrants into the UK's
liberalised telecommunications market.
It is already in negotiations with the Office of Telecommunications, the
industry regulator, over a licence to use its network to transmit
television, data and telephone services.
It is thought likely that NTL might form alliances with other groups such as
cable television operators which are seeking to take advantage of the
government's recent decision to end the telecommunications duopoly held by
BT and Mercury.
NTL operates about 475 transmitting sites and has access to a further 475
which are run by the BBC.
Its main business is transmitting for the ITV independent television
companies, Channel 4, the Welsh fourth channel S4C, and 50 independent local
radio stations.
Its services in this area, which will this year generate Pounds 61m of its
revenue, are governed by a price cap imposed by Oftel which limits annual
price rises to 1 per cent below the annual inflation rate.
Dr John Forrest, executive chairman, forecast that within the next few years
a third of NTL's income might come from new business activities,
transmitting for television's planned Channel 5 and local independent radio
contractors.
Mr Peter Lloyd, the broadcasting minister, said NTL would be sold by auction
to private bidders, expected to include foreign telecommunications and
television groups.
The privatisation is due in 1996. Price Waterhouse, the government's lead
financial adviser on the sale, said it had already received inquiries from
between 30 and 40 foreign and UK companies.
NTL's management favours a bid from a consortium that would include a 15 per
cent stake for the company's 770 employees as well as bringing it access to
European markets.
Television South West, the ITV contractor for the west country, is backing
the Channel Three Wales and the West consortium, bidding for the commercial
television franchise currently held by HTV covering Wales and the west.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Welcome to Robb's school of business: How a new boss is
bringing a market-driven philosophy to the drugs company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Wellcome's new management took over last summer, rivals in the
pharmaceutical industry still called the company Wellcome University - a
slightly derisory nickname that referred as much to its allegedly
uncommercial business attitudes as to its scientific excellence.
Mr John Robb came from Beecham to succeed Sir Alfred Shepperd. Sir Alfred
had run Wellcome as a private company owned by the Wellcome Trust medical
charity and seen it through the 1986 stock market flotation.
Working with a new non-executive chairman, Sir Alistair Frame, and finance
director, Mr John Precious - who left the Tioxide pigments group just before
it was taken over by ICI last year - Mr Robb quickly finished off Wellcome
University.
The new team told staff the company would no longer pursue projects that
seemed scientifically fascinating but commercially unpromising. The group,
they said, would undertake a vigorous cost-cutting programme, including the
loss of 40 out of 400 head office jobs, to boost profit margins.
By the end of last year, the company had closed its unproductive Wellcome
Biotechnology subsidiary and sold two businesses: vaccines to Medeva and the
Calmic hygiene services group to Rentokil.
Wellcome had been prepared simply to phase out vaccine production. The
vaccine business had become a symbol of corporate history, since the
company's founder, Sir Henry Wellcome, placed such importance on this area
in the late 19th century. But the board was pleasantly surprised to discover
that others were prepared to pay Pounds 20m for the vaccine business.
Market reaction to the first financial results reported by the new
executives, for the year to September 1990, reinforced their cost-cutting
message.
Mr Robb was not displeased when Wellcome shares fell by 15 per cent on
November 15 following the announcement of pre-tax profits Pounds 25m below
analysts' forecasts.
Yesterday's events - half-year profits Pounds 15m above market expectations
and the share price up 10 per cent - were almost the reverse of six months
ago; and they show that the cost-cutting message is getting through.
Even research and development spending, which had been rising rapidly at
Wellcome and other drug companies, fell from 14.7 to 14.1 per cent of sales.
But the transformation of Wellcome into a commercial group is far from
complete. The next big step is likely to involve the sale of its
environmental health and diagnostics businesses.
Mr Robb says Wellcome will retain 'only businesses which make, or have the
potential to make, a worthwhile contribution to our earnings per share'. It
is believed that environmental health (with 1990 sales of Pounds 83m) and
diagnostics (Pounds 38m sales) do not fit that criterion and the company is
actively negotiating their disposals.
If so, Wellcome will be concentrating on prescription drugs (Pounds 1.1bn
sales last year) and consumer healthcare (Pounds 200m sales). Mr Robb, who
made his reputation building up Beecham's consumer business, regards
healthcare as a core business for Wellcome. He wants to expand it,
particularly in continental Europe, where Wellcome has virtually no presence
in non-prescription medicines.
Another objective is to shift the group's geographical balance eastwards. In
1990, 55 per cent of sales were in the US and UK. Mr Robb's wants to sell
more medicines in Japan.
Mr Robb says one of the most sensitive issues for the future will be how to
cut costs in the poor countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Wellcome
is extensively represented in these regions due to its founder's
philanthropic and scientific interest in tropical medicine.
The prevalence of Aids in Africa makes the issue even more difficult, since
Wellcome's Retrovir is the leading treatment for the disease.
'It would be a difficult decision to walk away from those countries, and we
would have to move very cautiously,' he says. 'But a lot of effort goes into
them, with very little return. And it is difficult to ignore unprofitable
elements in the company.'

FT  03 MAY 91 / T &amp; N to shed 2,500 jobs and plans a Pounds 119m rights
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESSURE that falling car sales has inflicted on components suppliers
was reflected yesterday when T &amp; N announced 2,500 job losses and a Pounds
119m rights issue to fund its modernisation programme.
The move follows the shedding of 1,800 jobs last year and will cut the
group's worldwide workforce to less than 40,000.
Most of the losses will fall in the UK where the group has 16,000 workers.
The announcement came on the same day as Vauxhall announced record pre-tax
profits of Pounds 239.1m.
However, company chairman Mr Paul Tosch said operating profits fell by 13
per cent. As one of the car company heads who last week accused Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer,of delivering an anti-car budget, he
warned that the 1991 outlook for Vauxhall was not very encouraging.
Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering Union,
said: 'T &amp; N's news nails the lie that the recession is bottoming out.'
T &amp; N is one of the UK's 'big six' vehicle component suppliers, which
together have shed about 5,000 jobs in the past 12 months, and warned that
several thousand more will go this year.
They have been hit by the downturn in car, truck and replacement parts sales
in most markets except Germany.
In the UK, car sales fell from a record 2.3m in 1989 to 2m last year. A
further fall, to between 1.6m and 1.7m, is forecast for 1991, reflecting in
part the changes in VAT and company car taxation in the Budget.
Mr Colin Hope, T &amp; N chairman, said the group wanted to keep up its
investment programme to make it more competitive internationally,
particularly against the Japanese and Germans. Capital spending had totalled
Pounds 327m over the last five years.
However, the group did not want to increase its borrowings. By December, net
debt had risen to Pounds 248m, giving debt-equity gearing of 49 per cent.
The one-for-four rights issue, priced at 140p a share, would reduce that
ratio to less than 30 per cent.
Some market disappointment at the move was reflected in an 11p fall in the
share price to 163p. It is little more than a year since the group's last
rights issue, a one-for-three at 150p a share, related to a US acquisition.
Mr Hope warned that the group's first-half results this year would be well
below the Pounds 46.1m recorded pre-tax last time. They would be more like
1990's second half, when the taxable amount slid to Pounds 24.4m.
The board said it would maintain the total dividend at 10.85p.
The group allowed Pounds 14m for redundancies in its 1990 accounts. The
latest cuts will incur additional costs of Pounds 7m.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Buying spree in Polly Peck shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Polly Peck International have been the subject of a concerted
buying spree in recent days and weeks, pushing up the price ahead of
reconstruction plans due to be announced shortly.
Institutional and large private investors have been approached by
individuals saying they are buying on their own account or for overseas
trusts, whose beneficiaries are not disclosed. There has also been a wave of
buying in Zurich, where Polly Peck is still quoted. The shares have been
suspended in London since last September.
Institutions said that they believed the buying could reflect the creation
of a substantial interest by Turkish or northern Cypriot interests.
Mr Asil Nadir, Polly Peck's Turkish Cypriot chairman, said in a statement
through his lawyers yesterday that he did not know anything about the recent
share buying. 'He is co-operating closely with the administrators and the
indications from them prior to the creditors' meeting on 24 May are very
encouraging,' the statement added.
News of the buying surge is known to have caused concern to the authorities
in London, especially since reconstruction plans for Polly Peck are due to
be announced by the group's administrators within days. An optimistic report
from the administrators would boost the prospects for Polly Peck
shareholders.
The shares, which reached a peak of 450p, fell to 108p before being
suspended last autumn. About a month ago, institutions and private
individuals were approached with offers of 10p a share. That has now risen
to 12p per share in new approaches.
Under UK rules, transactions in the shares of suspended companies are still
allowed to take place, although members of the Stock Exchange are not
allowed to take part in any dealing.
In Zurich, meanwhile, several million shares are understood to have changed
hands in recent weeks, pushing the share price from around 10p to 22p.
Several private investors with large numbers of shares have been telephoned
from London by a man calling himself Mr Richards. He offered to buy blocks
of 50,000 shares or more at 12p a share. Mr Richards says he is buying for
his own account rather than for another investor.

AGGRESSIVE plans for expansion at Kwik Save, the discount grocery chain,
were reinforced by a 22 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits.
The group planned to step up its store opening programme, said Mr Graeme
Seabrook, chief executive, to one store a week over the next three years.
The company said it had benefited from the extension of scanning which
covers over 90 per cent of sales volumes and is expected to cover all sales
by the year-end.
Kwik Save is to buy back the Liquorsave concessions in its stores from
Argyll Group. This will give it an additional 240 concessions in its stores
to add to its 375 existing Best of Cellars outlets.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TSB GROUP, the sixth-largest UK bank, is to withdraw from Northern Ireland
and sell its 56-branch network there to Allied Irish Banks, the largest bank
in the Irish Republic, for Pounds 111m.
The deal will make AIB the third largest banking group in Northern Ireland,
after the Northern Bank and the Ulster Bank. At present it has 45 branches
in Northern Ireland. The two banks have an estimated combined share of about
25 per cent.
Mr Peter Sutherland, AIB chairman, said the TSB acquisition was an important
ingredient in AIB's strategy of increasing its strength in its core market.
'It is one of the biggest ever private sector investments in Northern
Ireland and is a vote of confidence in its economy,' he said.
TSB said yesterday that it had been approached by AIB about the sale.
'It is good for TSB Group shareholders, whose investment in TSB Bank
Northern Ireland is being sold for a price well in excess of book value,'
said Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB chairman.
AIB has paid Pounds 42.5m in goodwill, above the Pounds 68.5m book value of
the operations, which last year made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 17.7m,
including a pensions holiday benefit of Pounds 1.25m, on total assets of
Pounds 697.2m.
It has given an undertaking that there will be no compulsory redundancies in
Northern Ireland among the 1,400 employees of the two banks as a result of
the TSB takeover.
Mr John Taylor, an Ulster Unionist party MP, said yesterday that AIB still
did not employ people on a basis which reflected the religious composition
of Northern Ireland and called on the bank not to discriminate against
Protestant employees in any rationalisation.
In the past there have been allegations that both banks contravened fair
employment rules in Northern Ireland with AIB alleged to employ a
disproportionate number of Roman Catholics while TSB allegedly leaned
towards Protestant employees.
Mr Gerry Scanlan, AIB chief executive, said that there would 'definitely not
be a rights issue' to fund the TSB purchase.
Last year AIB made an IPounds 160m (Pounds 145m) rights issue to finance a
Dollars 217m (Pounds 125.8m) bid for Baltimore Bancorp in the US.
However, the bid was eventually abandoned because of the parlous state of
the US banking sector.
TSB Group has struggled to contain losses on bad debts by Hill Samuel, its
merchant banking subsidiary.
In March, Sir Nicholas told shareholders that the bank faced a sharp cut in
interim profits this year because of continuing losses on corporate lending
by Hill Samuel.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Ford and Vauxhall attack claim on prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD AND Vauxhall, the UK car market leaders, yesterday attacked figures
produced for the Monopolies and Mergers Commission claiming that some
pre-tax car prices charged in the UK are over 50 per cent higher than in
certain other European markets.
The controversial figures produced for the MMC by Ludvigsen Associates, the
UK-based automotive consultancy, are expected to provoke a fierce dispute as
the MMC finalises its monopolies inquiry into the distribution and pricing
of new cars in the UK.
The MMC has already provisionally concluded that at least two so-called
'complex monopolies' exist in the supply of new cars, which 'prevent,
restrict or distort' competition in the UK market.
The Consumers' Association claimed yesterday that the Ludvigsen report
vindicated its 10-year campaign claiming that cars 'can be thousands of
pounds cheaper in continental Europe compared with the UK.
'The details of the MMC's work blow out of the water the arguments of
manufacturers that price differences are due to special factors - such as
exchange rate movements, specification differences and discounts.'
Mr Paul Tosch, chairman and managing director of Vauxhall, which controls
about 16 per cent of the UK new car market, said the company had
commissioned its own independent research which cast serious doubts on the
Ludvigsen findings.
'We do not agree with the Ludvigsen figures. We have not finished our
discussions with the MMC, but on a broad basis we are very competitive in
the UK. In some cases prices in the UK are in the lower range compared with
the rest of Europe.'
Vauxhall also questioned the methodology of the report prepared for the MMC,
which had sought to establish actual transaction prices through telephone
calls to dealers, in contrast to the Vauxhall study, which had been based on
invoices of actual deals.
Mr Tosch said Vauxhall had largely stayed within the allowable 12 per cent
price band laid down by the European Commission for car price differentials
between national markets in Europe, except for a couple of 'rogue' models.
Mr Lindsey Halstead, chairman of Ford of Europe, which captured 25 per cent
of UK new car sales last year, said differences in pan-European car prices
were 'affected by a complex series of issues. There are some factors that
the Ludvigsen study did not even consider'.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Budget rethink urged for EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RADICAL rethink of European Community finances is needed to meet
fast-growing expenditure demands, senior Commission officials said.
Speaking on the day that the draft budget for 1992 was unveiled, two
officials suggested that a summit of EC heads of government was likely to be
called.
The latest draft is the last to be prepared under the five-year accord
reached by EC heads of government in February 1988 which doubled regional
spending but limited the overall budget within a ceiling of 1.2 per cent of
Community GDP.
The European Commission suggested spending of Ecu65.2bn (Pounds 45.3bn) in
1992, a rise of only 11.3 per cent on this year, compared with a 19 per cent
increase last year. But this comes as individual member-states face severe
squeezes on their own finances, with national budgets rising by an average
6.3 per cent.
Almost the entire increase is in the farm budget, theoretically set to rise
10 per cent to Ecu34.7bn - against a 30 per cent rise this year - and
spending on backward and industrially declining regions, which would be up
around 25 per cent to Ecu19bn if east Germany is included.
These two sectors - along with the Community's growing external commitments
in east Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, the rest of Africa, Latin
America and Asia - are the ones likely to need significantly more funds when
the 1988 agreement runs out.
The Commission does not yet know whether it can contain within its proposed
10 per cent extra spending the current explosion in farm spending, caused by
overproduction. But it is clear that the radical reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy it plans to detail in June will increase costs.
The extent of this rise will depend on the level of compensation to farmers
for severe price cuts and for taking land out of production, and how much is
spent on alternative rural development.
Regional spending also seems set to cost more. Spain wants a Community fund
for budget transfers to help the rest of the EC catch up with the north
before it agrees to economic, monetary and political union.
Madrid rejects a compromise brokered by the Commission and the Luxembourg
presidency of the EC, which foresees more money for existing regional
programmes, new standby funds for structural reform, and a loosening of
restrictions on how the funds can be applied.

FT  03 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: CS Holding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the bad news finally out of the way at CS Holding? Zurich seems
tentatively to have thought so yesterday; the shares, initially down some 2
per cent on news of a catastrophic year at CS First Boston, rallied by more
than twice that, to SFr2,160, as the market mulled the refinancing plans.
These are ingenious. Floating off part of Credit Suisse may or may not
soften the Swiss legal mind on the subject of bank capital adequacy. But it
will certainly raise money, as will the forthcoming loan issue, the
equivalent of up to 25 per cent of group capital; this is obviously not true
of the one-for-20 warrants for un-issued shares. Flexibility is what
chairman Rainer Gut says the group will gain; it seems a mild term for a
potentially large recapitalisation.
With one leap Rainer was free? Only up to a point. The group will gain
underlying capital strength, but properly consolidated accounts could have
made the ground look still firmer, though these are very explicit figures by
old Swiss standards. But the explanations are less impressive than the
numbers. The group had no such exceptional Gulf exposure that CS First
Boston should have entered the league of biggest loss-makers. Nor is the
news that CS First Boston had a profitable first quarter persuasive given
the bull market in Wall Street.
What remains to be proved is that Mr Gut was right to buy out CS's former
Boston partners in catastrophe, and that the group now has the talent and
controls in place to avert a repetition. It may not be until we get the 1991
report that we will begin to know.

FT  03 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There has always been more to Wellcome than its Retrovir anti-viral drug.
Judging by the market's enthusiastic reception for yesterday's figures - the
shares outstripped even the 10 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits -
the group may finally have pushed this message home. It was Zovirax, an
older anti-viral drug, which proved the engine of an impressive performance,
sales rising nearly 30 per cent in local currency terms. Adjusting for
currency and the extra week last year, sales in the prescription and
consumer divisions rose by 18 and 11 per cent respectively. And as dosage
levels stabilise, Retrovir should resume the heady growth of the late 1980s.
The new management cannot yet rest on its laurels. Attempts to squeeze costs
out of the business are by no means complete, in spite of the gratifying
rise in operating margins to 24.3 per cent. Indeed, without an Pounds 8m
pension surplus benefit, taken directly into UK trading profit, the margin
would have been a full point lower. Put another way, the pension fund
contributed 47 per cent of the profits rise. A similar surplus will boost
the second half and the foreseeable future, but will be accounted for
separately in the full-year figures.
Assuming Pounds 370m pre-tax this year, yesterday's rise leaves the shares
on a prospective p/e of 21, or a 44 per cent premium to the market. Glaxo,
which has out-performed the market by nearly as much as Wellcome has
under-performed it since the start of 1990, is on a lesser premium of around
30 per cent; but Wellcome is starting from a lower base and seems to be
growing more rapidly. The rating looks justified.

FT  03 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: T&amp;N
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to be rude about T&amp;N's rights issue, the fourth cash call in five
years. The shares have underperformed the market by 50 per cent since 1986.
The proceeds do little more than cover the next two annual dividend
payments. And the yield on the new paper works out at 10.3 per cent. With
the balance sheet not seriously stretched, the market is entitled to be
cynical.
T&amp;N, however, still deserves the benefit of the doubt, and not merely
because it is one of those companies still trying to keep UK manufacturing
competitive. Trying to escape the long shadow of asbestos claims, it has
undergone a radical transformation, with a growing reputation for the
quality of its automotive and engineering products and big orders from Ford
in Europe and Nissan in the US. The problem is maintaining the high levels
of R and D and capital spending which made this possible at a time when
markets, notably automotive markets, have collapsed around the world.
T&amp;N's recent earnings record is miserable - minus 9.5 per cent compound over
the last five years. But if it emerges from the current recession with lower
costs and a sustained reputation for quality there is scope for a sharp
reversal of trend. The trouble for investors hoping for more than a good
yield is that the dividend cover (1.2 times) will take time to repair.

FT  03 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: A matter of interest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,530.7 (+22.3)
Global interest rate policy is still made in Washington, as far as Europe's
equity markets are concerned. Share price gains yesterday were spread across
the board: 2 1/2 per cent in France, 1 1/2 per cent in Germany, 0.9 per cent
in London. Equity markets are evidently half-persuaded that where US
interest rates lead, others will follow, no matter what is said at G7
meetings.
UK short-term interest rates, indeed, are discounting a half percentage
point cut in base rates by June, with May 17, the date of the next RPI
figures, a popular candidate. None the less, London's rise yesterday was
accomplished on unexciting volume, only a little better than that of recent
dismal sessions. Monday, in particular, was one of the worst days for
activity since the rally started.
By historical standards, it can be argued that London is not dangerously
costly; or even (looking at the ratio between long-term interest rates and
equity yields) that it is rather cheap. That ratio is sensitive to
inflation, though. It has moved in its current range only since inflation
took off in the mid-1960s. If inflation were now to move permanently to a
lower level, the normal range would shift downwards too, making today's
level less of a bargain.
Hopes remain of a flood of cash takeover bids to offset the Chinese water
torture of rights issues; corporate lawyers talk of merger work stacking up
in their offices, waiting to burst upon the world once preparation is
completed. So far, that is just talk; until it becomes more than that,
London will continue to bounce between New York's side-effects and the local
election hangover.

FT  03 MAY 91 / De Klerk offers blacks cabinet seats: Pretoria goes some way
to meeting ANC's demands, but ministers to stay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT FW de Klerk offered yesterday to include South Africa's black
opposition groups in his cabinet and promised to amend tough security laws
in an effort to avoid threatened confrontation with the African National
Congress.
The moves, in a speech by Mr de Klerk to parliament in Cape Town, was the
government's reply to an ultimatum from the ANC which expires next Thursday.
The ANC has said it will boycott talks on a post-apartheid constitution
unless the government acts by then to halt township violence in which nearly
10,000 people have died since 1984.
Mr de Klerk offered concessions on the most important of the demands,
although he ignored others and may not have gone far enough to prevent the
ANC suspending talks. He will not accede, for example, to the ANC's call for
the dismissal of Mr Adriaan Volk, law and order minister, and of General
Magnus Malan, defence minister.
He is attempting to go some way towards meeting most of the other six points
in the ultimatum: dismantling of all counter-insurgency units; suspension of
policemen involved in two incidents where ANC supporters were killed; a ban
on the carrying of weapons at public gatherings; a ban on the issue of live
ammunition to police at such events; phasing out of single-sex township
hostels; and an independent inquiry into complaints of security force
misconduct.
Mr de Klerk said he would go ahead with all-party talks on May 24 and 25
about ways to end the violence 'with or without the ANC.'
Responding to one of the ultimatum's seven demands, Mr de Klerk said he
would scrap some of the most hated provisions of the country's Internal
Security Act, the law used to crush anti-apartheid protest in the 1980s.
The aim, he said, was to strip the law of 'provisions that may have an
inhibiting effect on participation in normal political activities'.
The act's sweeping authority to banish dissidents, close newspapers and put
anti-apartheid activists under house arrest would be removed.
Mr de Klerk stopped short of announcing the abolition of detention without
trial, saying that the provisions for declaring organisations illegal and
detaining people for questioning - section 29 of the act - would be 'amended
drastically'.
In a move which may go some way towards meeting the ANC's demand for an
interim government, Mr de Klerk suggested that a transitional cabinet could
include 'a relatively broad spectrum of competent South Africans', including
members of the main parties to constitutional negotiations.
Such a cabinet, which would by implication include the ANC, could only be
formed after a planned multi-party conference had been convened to discuss
drawing up a new constitution.
Dealing with other aspects of the ANC ultimatum, he announced a 10-point
plan to combat the violence which has claimed more than 100 lives in the
past week.
He said that the police force would be strengthened, community involvement
would be sought to end violence and a permanent commission would investigate
causes of unrest.
There would also be job creation programmes to aid social conditions in
townships, and money for victims of violence.
The men-only hostels, where much of the violence has been centred, would be
converted or upgraded and control of dangerous weapons would be
'intensified'.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Competing With Germany: An orderly model that enforces
restraint - The effectiveness of Germany's consensus-based trade union
bargaining system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The vast differences between Europe's national pay bargaining systems could
be the undoing of European monetary integration. Europe's labour leaders did
not dwell upon the prospect in Wednesday's May Day speeches but economists
are beginning to issue warnings.
'This is the Achilles heel of monetary union. The structurally weak
countries with greatest pressure for unsustainable pay rises will become
even weaker because they will not be able to use the exchange rate to pass
on costs,' says Professor Fritz Scharpf, a leading German labour economist.
In the centralised, consensus-based bargaining systems of northern Europe,
unions can usually anticipate the macroeconomic and employment consequences
of their actions. In the UK and parts of southern Europe they are
institutionally unable, or unwilling, to do so. In the early 1980s
unemployment in the UK was twice as high as in West Germany, but UK wages
rose twice as fast.
So does the system in the UK have to become more like the German? The German
model has certainly produced impressive results. The country has almost the
highest wages and shortest working time in Europe but an ordered bargaining
system which produced increases in unit labour costs of less than 1 per cent
a year for much of the 1980s with scarcely a day lost in strike action. By
contrast unit labour costs in the UK rose by 7 per cent a year, even in the
more disciplined 1980s, and each year about 300 working days per 1,000
workers was lost.
Union organisation looks relatively weak in west Germany, with about 34 per
cent of workers in unions compared with more than 40 per cent in the UK, but
labour - whether in unions or not - has a much louder institutional voice.
An astonishing 90 per cent of all workers are covered by union-negotiated
wage agreements.
The state ensures the right to join a union and otherwise keeps out of
bargaining. But the law is ever-present. It makes wage contracts (usually
industry-wide) legally binding, so strikes can only take place after a
contract has expired. If a union breaks the rules on strike conduct it can
be sued.
This enforced restraint is balanced by the powers granted in Germany's
co-determination system. In any plant employing more than five people the
workers can elect a works council which has an important influence, for
example, over sackings, but cannot call strikes. The rights are enjoyed by
employees, not unions, and although three-quarters of works council members
are union officials they increasingly represent the shopfloor against union
head office.
In quoted companies with more than 2,000 employees the workers have rights
to business information and to seats alongside the shareholder
representatives on the supervisory board, which oversees the executive
board. This amounts to a real qualification on the freedom of capital which,
in Germany, is just another 'corporate stakeholder' alongside labour and
management.
Workers on the supervisory board act as a deterrent to hostile takeovers,
and are a standing pressure for high, job-creating, local investment. Bigger
companies also use workers' pension cash as working capital, a practice
banned in the UK, which gives a financial underpinning to co-determination
and helps explain German companies' relative reluctance to invest overseas.
This company and plant-level co-determination dovetails with the sector-wide
wage-bargaining system. Bargaining is made easier by the fact that unions
have reliable information about corporate performance. And the fact that
strikes cannot originate with the works council, but only with one of the 16
national unions after a wage contract has run out, means plant relations can
remain harmonious.
For that reason neither employers nor unions want to follow Britain towards
more plant-level bargaining. However industry-wide bargaining does not
preclude regional pay differences, performance-linked sector variations, and
some topping up of wage deals especially for white-collar workers.
There are 34,000 west German wage and conditions deals but only six key ones
between national unions and employers' associations. Most employers accept
the deals even when their workforce is not unionised, saying this regulates
competition for labour and keeps unions out.
Economists claim centralised bargaining has a downward pressure on pay
increases because, in the metal industry for example, the union has to
consider not only workers in the big, profitable car plants, but also those
in small family firms and in the struggling north German shipyards. In the
UK this situation is reversed, with powerful company bargaining groups, such
as Ford, setting a target the weaker try to emulate.
The fact that pay increases for 90 per cent of German workers are determined
in a handful of trend-setting national negotiations certainly concentrates
negotiators' minds on the macro-economic effects of their actions. The
independence of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, has also had an
impact.
'Everyone who negotiates here knows they cannot ignore the Bundesbank
because it has the power to annul the theoretical wage increase you have
just won,' says Mr Heinz-Werner Meyer, leader of the German Trade Union
Federation.
In 1973, for example, the Bundesbank used its control over monetary policy
to tighten interest rates sharply. This move deliberately hastened the
recession in response to an unacceptably high wage rise. The unions learned
their lesson and after the second oil price shock did not try to claw back
the price rise. Relations between Bundesbank and union economists remain
close and through those links the bank can indicate the room for manoeuvre
on wages.
The Bundesbank's role underlines how difficult it would be for countries
such as Britain, without an independent central bank, to try a wholesale
adoption of the German model. That model is also the product of a different
post-war history marked by a determination to avoid the social conflict that
created Hitler. 'Labour has a different attitude to capital in Germany,'
says Mr Meyer.
As Professor David Marquand, from Salford University, points out, the social
market economy is not just Anglo-American capitalism with better social
provision, it is a different sort of capitalism, involving more labour
integration into industrial decision-making. There is a powerful union lobby
even in the centre-right Christian Democratic party and union views are
heard in all the organs of economic management.
The model has flaws. Necessary restructuring can be hindered by unions'
power to place job security above all other virtues. And despite the
macro-economic transparency of the bargaining system, unemployment was about
9 per cent for much of the 1980s.
Further, just as unification has dented Germany's exemplary status in fiscal
and inflationary prudence it has, too, released a wave of criticism of the
unions for pushing up wages in east Germany too fast. Bargaining in west
Germany is also going through a rocky patch as some unions try to catch up
on the very low, even negative, real pay rises of the late 1980s, partly the
result of three-year deals. The metal workers have just begun brief
stoppages in pursuit of a rise three times the current 3 per cent inflation
rate.
But the model remains a magnet to many in Britain. Employers like legally
binding agreements, the 75 per cent of votes cast needed to strike, and
acceptance of the 'neutral' pay rise. Unions like works council powers and
information rights; policymakers admire industrial unions representing all
worker grades in an industry and the centralised bargaining open to
macroeconomic trade-offs. The model also has opponents, including the craft
unions, employers and politicians who further decentralised the UK system in
the 1980s.
Mr Meyer believes that move has merely encouraged 'plant syndicalism' while
Prof Scharpf says British unions need a clearer legal framework and more
centralised decision-making. 'Thatcherite decentralisation is a dead-end.
You should try again with Barbara Castle's or Ted Heath's reforms,' he says.

<TEXT>
Our Polish Pope would really do very nicely as a contemporary European
polit-ician. He is at the ext-reme centre of debate, uncompromisingly
anti-communist but possessed of a clear aversion to purist economic
liberalism. Social democrats and social market economists who lightly carry
consciences no larger than those of the writers of party political
advertisements may extract much of what they wish from John Paul II's latest
encyclical, published yesterday. It is full of irresistible sound-bites.
'The free market is the most efficient instrument for utilising resources
and effectively responding to needs,' he acknowledges, adding, a few strokes
of the pen later, that 'there are many human needs which find no place on
the market'. Most of us know both these propositions and almost everyone - I
exclude the wackiest of our liberal economists - accepts them both. You
could call these sentiments banal.
Yet it is instructive that the Pope should endorse them, as he does in a
hundred different ways, in his 30,000-word essay.
For yesterday's encyclical, Centesimus Annus, has been published to mark the
100th anniversary of Rerum Novarum, Pope Leo XIII's celebrated attack on
Marxism and revolutionary socialism. Mr Karol Wojtyla, as he would be known
were he in secular politics, has seen his native land throw off a communist
dictatorship 'by means of peaceful protest, using only the weapons of truth
and justice'. He has no truck with Marxism; to label him a socialist in
fancy vestments would be a travesty. Yet he is no Reaganite, no Thatcherite,
no proponent of the market as an end in itself.
The closest fit, unsurprisingly, would be with Europe's Christian Democratic
parties, with a touch of the social democrat thrown in. When the German and
Italian Christian democrats drew up their party programmes afresh after 1945
it was to Rerum Novarum that they turned for inspiration. They might move
just a twitch leftwards if their programmes were based on Centesimus Annus
today, but you would hardly notice the difference. British Tories could not
stomach the Christian Democratic acknowledgement of trade unions as social
partners. But then Britain is an ex-Catholic country. It does not understand
the continental mentality.
'The Church acknowledges the legitimate role of profit as an indication that
a business is functioning well,' states the Pope. 'But profitability is not
the only indicator of a firm's condition. It is possible for the financial
accounts to be in order and yet for the people - who make up the firm's most
valuable asset - to be humiliated and their dignity offended.' You will see
what I mean.
This apparent muddle is no accident. The Pontiff is regarded by his
followers as infallible on matters of doctrine and Christian principle The
Pope criticises 'consumerism' - as he ought, starting from where he does
but he does not claim infallibility when it comes to social and economic
analysis. He is refreshingly modest about that aspect of his encyclical. It
does not offer a specific political philosophy; it does warn against what he
sees as present dangers.
As I read him, the greatest of those is probably alienation - the gradual
withering-away of faith and the consequent evolution of a wholly secular
society devoid of religion and therefore of moral roots. This is happening
at a chillingly rapid pace in the west although at least some of the young
in newly-liberated eastern Europe are rediscovering the faith professed by
their parents before the communists took over. The Pope is highly critical
of western 'consumerism' and selfish economic behaviour, as he should be.
His job, after all, is to affirm the dignity, the transcendental nature, of
the human being (not just of 'man', Mr Wojtyla); hence his belief that 'the
social message of the Gospel must not be considered a theory, but above all
else a basis and a motivation for action'.
This is where we get into such concepts, difficult for the British mind to
take in, as 'solidarity', which is not merely the name of a Polish trade
union, and 'subsidiarity', which you will be glad to hear is a story into
which I do not wish to go this morning. Human beings are responsible for one
another - hence 'solidarity' - which means that the wealthy countries of the
west are morally bound to assist those in the Third World, not to mention
those in the 'Fourth World,' the lowest echelons of capitalist society
itself.
It is all of a piece. The encyclical recognises that the capitalist method
of organisation, will create the most wealth. It therefore embraces private
property, enterprise, the rule of law, and the other necessary ingredients
of a functioning free market. But it does not wish this powerful mechanism
to be 'unbridled', any more than did Leo XIII. It therefore advocates using
the wealth to uphold the dignity of the individual - although it is sniffy
about the large welfare state, which spawns bureaucracies, and suspicious of
state ownership of industries except for the briefest moment in emergencies.
Its preferred methodology is private charity, the work of voluntary
organisations, support of local communities, encouragement of the church.
Some people might protest that this is a confusing mish-mash, that it does
not set out in unequivocal terms what the individual should seek from her or
his political leaders. Others might read all sorts of internecine Church
nuances into it, or mock the Vatican's publicists, who are selling this
encyclical as hard as they can.
Not a Catholic myself, I prefer to take the Pope's words at face value.
Religious intolerance can be murderous, as we know from contemporary events
in the Middle East, but the absence of all religion, as envisaged by the
late Mr John Lennon, is a terrifying prospect. It would return humanity to
the jungle, armed to the teeth. We all need the Pope, and his encyclicals.
If there were no such thing it would be necessary to invent him.

FT  03 MAY 91 / The revolt of the Names: Reforms at Lloyd's insurance market
are unlikely to satisfy those members who are facing huge losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sad thing is how gullible we were,' says a Name at Lloyd's of London,
reflecting on the 'exquisite lunches' and 'glib promises' that persuaded him
to become a member at the insurance market in 1978.
Today the Name - the individuals who commit a minimum of Pounds 250,000 to
back underwriting activities - is one of several thousands facing potential
bankruptcy as a result of the losses sustained by the market. The sharply
deteriorating financial position stems mainly from US liability suits and
claims arising from natural disasters.
Names, who are formed into more than 350 groups, or syndicates, have
unlimited liability for the losses they incur. For Lloyd's, the disillusion
of many Names and the damaging publicity from current court cases has cast a
cloud over the market's future as it seeks to halt the decline in its share
of specialised commercial insurance and reinsurance.
As Lloyd's prepares to close its accounts for the 1988 year, in line with
its three-year accounting system, it is expected to record an overall loss
of at least Pounds 150m. Its premium income for the same period amounted to
about Pounds 6bn.
In 1989, while premium income seems likely to stay at about the same figure,
losses could be as much as Pounds 1bn, according to Mr John Rew, co-author
of Chatset's Lloyd's League Tables, a comprehensive guide to the market. By
comparison, in the golden years of 1986 and 1987, Lloyd's made overall
profits of Pounds 649.5m and Pounds 509.2m, a return of 17.5 per cent and
12.1 per cent of premium income.
Names are bearing the brunt of the downturn. Some estimates suggest that
several thousand could become insolvent this year. 'The fact is that a
horrendously large number of people are going bankrupt,' says the chairman
of one group of Names considering legal action to recoup losses. The
financial difficulties of the Names are being aggravated by the recession,
with a depressed housing market making it difficult to raise cash by selling
property.
Dr Mary Archer, chairman of the Lloyd's Hardship Committee established last
year to help Names in acute difficulties, and the wife of former
Conservative party chairman Mr Jeffrey Archer, says the number of appeals
for help has accelerated recently to about 150. She adds: 'I have to say
that I would expect the case-load this year to be very heavy.'
Until January 1990, Names had merely to show personal wealth of Pounds
100,000, and so it is people who joined the market before this date that
have been most severely affected.
Although Lloyd's membership carries an aura of wealth, many Names are middle
class and joined the market because, says Mr Rew: 'They are strapped for
cash. They need the income from Lloyd's for extras like school fees.' In a
good year, Names could expect a return of at least 12 per cent on their
investment.
A fundamental and continuing attraction of membership has been that Names
need only lodge 30 per cent of their Pounds 250,000 commitment with Lloyd's.
They can continue to collect interest, dividends or rental income on the
remainder. 'Over the years people have done pretty well. The money was easy
to put up,' says one Name who works in a UK merchant bank and who joined the
market in 1985. 'I just had to show property of Pounds 40,000 and a bank
guarantee for Pounds 60,000.'
Many Names, especially those who joined between 1977 and 1986 when Lloyd's
membership nearly tripled, have insufficient capital to pay their share of
current losses.
Last week the personal columns of one national newspaper carried an
advertisement that conjured images of Dickensian social disgrace. 'Ruined
Name at Lloyd's,' it read. 'Must earn. Have wife. Will travel.'
As the losses start to mount, more and more Names are refusing to pay up.
Some Names are said to be 'protecting' their assets. There are reports that
some Names have signed over their property and paper wealth to their spouses
or have even shifted their money abroad. Increasingly, Names are resorting
to legal action. Members of six syndicates have issued, and in some cases
served, writs alleging that the negligence of their agents and underwriters
is to blame for losses they have incurred.
The court cases will be long. Much of the litigation stems from the market's
exposure to US liability risks - asbestosis and pollution - which were not
well understood at the time when syndicates contracted the original policies
in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Claims on these policies have resulted from
court decisions of the 1970s and 1980s, in which US judges interpreted the
law in a way that was more generous to policyholders than had been the case
20 years before.
To complicate matters further, much of this 'high risk' liability business
was insured and reinsured in London at a time when the rules governing
Lloyd's market were not as stringent as they are today.
From the market's point of view, the possibility of future claims on many of
these US liability policies cannot be ruled out. The uncertainty means that
syndicate managers have been unable to assess the scale of future claims and
more than 90 underwriting years have been left open - syndicates' accounts
cannot be closed. Since Names cannot leave Lloyd's while they are on an
'open year', many hundreds are, in effect, trapped.
A look at some of the outstanding and potential cases against Lloyd's will
serve to illustrate the problems the market now faces:
Last week, a civil case brought by 33 Names - members of four syndicates
formerly managed by Oakeley Vaughan Underwriting Agency, now in liquidation
 -against the Corporation of Lloyd's, began at the High Court in London.
This is the first time in the market's 300-year history that a case against
Lloyd's has actually gone to court.
The Names allege Lloyd's failed properly to supervise the market in the
period between 1980 and 1982 when, as a result of financial mismanagement,
the Oakeley Vaughan syndicates made heavy losses.
A civil case involving more than 880 Names who were members of the Outhwaite
syndicate 317/661 in 1982 is set to go to court in November. The Names are
suing various agents at Lloyd's to recoup insurance losses of more than
Pounds 200m. In 1982 Outhwaite reinsured the asbestosis exposures of about
20 Lloyd's syndicates. The action against Outhwaite alleges that the
acceptance of so big a risk by Outhwaite without any corresponding
reinsurance constituted negligent underwriting. The Names also allege that
the members' agents that funnelled their Names on to the Outhwaite syndicate
were also negligent.
About 570 Names who backed syndicate 553, managed by the Warrilow agency,
face losses of about Pounds 80m and have issued writs against the agency and
members' agents, alleging negligence in the way business was conducted. The
case is expected to come to court next year.
Names on two syndicates, 90 and 334, managed by Pulbrook Underwriting
Agency, face some of the heaviest individual losses. Two hundred and eighty
Names who were members of Pulbrook syndicate 334 in 1985 lost about Pounds
30m and have issued writs against the syndicate's managing agent and
members' agents.
A further 250 Names who were members of Pulbrook syndicate 90 face losses of
about Pounds 40m and have also sued members and managing agents. Names on
syndicate 90 allege that Pulbrook Underwriting Management, which managed the
syndicate, was negligent in failing to make full business disclosure to its
reinsurers, thus enabling the reinsurer to deny liability. Winchester
Bowring, the broker which placed the reinsurance contract, is also accused
of negligence.
Late last year over 100 Names who backed syndicates 106 in 1985 and 108 in
1986 issued writs against the syndicates' managing agency, John Poland, and
members' agencies.
Next week, more than 2,000 Names who face potential losses of Pounds 300m as
a result of the failures of syndicates managed by the Feltrim agency are
expected to decide whether to pursue legal action. If they go ahead, they
will push the total number of litigating Names to more than 2,000, a figure
approaching 10 per cent of the market's total membership. An official at one
members' agency believes half the market's membership of 26,500 could be
involved in court action before the end of the year.
Though all these cases involve individual allegations of negligence or
misconduct, a more fundamental problem provides the backdrop to them. Even
without the losses sustained in the US, changes in the structure of the
market itself would have made it a riskier place in which to invest over the
past 10 years.
During the 1980s the rate of underwriting profit that a typical Lloyd's
member could expect to make fell by more than a third, says Mr David Newton,
who runs an investment advisory service for overseas Names.
After the introduction of a new self-regulatory regime at Lloyd's in 1982,
syndicates and their agents incurred expensive new legal obligations which
increased the cost of doing business in the market. Salaries also increased
sharply. As a result, the fees that some Names pay to their agents have
doubled over the past 10 years, says Mr Newton.
Names also run more risk now. They can still deduct any underwriting losses
against other income to reduce tax bills, but this is much less of an
advantage than it was during the 1970s when the top rate of personal income
tax was 98 per cent. More important is the fact that while only a minority
of syndicates made losses in the early 1980s, more recently the market as a
whole has been affected as a result of a combination of factors.
First, premiums have been depressed as a result of competition between
Lloyd's and international companies; second, Lloyd's syndicates have
recorded a string of billion-dollar losses as a result of natural disasters;
and third, there has been a continuing deterioration in results from US
liability business because of the impact of pollution claims.
In the past Names have typically relied on the advice of their members'
agent, taking little interest in the results of the syndicates which they
were backing. But because of the current harsh conditions they are less
likely to succeed if they do not keep a close eye on their affairs. They
must look at 'membership as a true business proposition,' says Mr Newton.
But does the market provide enough of the right kind of information to make
such an approach possible? And are its regulatory mechanisms adequate to
protect Names? Lloyd's practices in two areas - the mechanisms to monitor
premium income accepted by syndicates and the amount of information
disclosed to Names - have both improved since 1982.
But despite these improvements in the market's practice, there are still
serious grounds for concern. One Name, who became a member of Lloyd's in
1984, says: 'They are not disclosing the truly significant business. I would
hazard a guess that Lloyd's is 15 to 20 years behind the Stock Exchange in
its requirements of disclosure' of business information.
The chairman of Lloyd's Mr David Coleridge, who took over late last year, is
receptive to criticism. His election was significant in several ways, not
least because he represents the growing power of the bigger agency groups,
such as Sturge and Merrett, whose interests are best served by a more stable
relationship between a richer, more selectively recruited set of Names and a
more professional market.
A task force, on which Mr Anthony Haynes, the chairman of the Association of
Lloyd's Members, as well as a several leading figures on the market is
sitting, is conducting a through review of operations. Mr Haynes is
optimistic that its report could lead to improvements. But for those
embittered Names who face bankruptcy, reform could come too late.

THE WORKERS' flag is deepest pink, or so we might conclude from Wednesday's
Labour party election broadcast on television.
'The Financial Times says: 'Today the Labour party looks like the competent
party with sound ideas on local government. The Conservative party has no
policies.' ' Thus went the first of no fewer than four ringing endorsements
for Labour from this newspaper.
The attentive viewer might have noticed that on the subsequent three
occasions the phrase 'on local government' had disappeared. But it would
have taken a viewer with considerable powers of memory to recollect the
context of this remark, from our political columnist, Joe Rogaly. It was as
follows:
'Labour governance of the poor by the unemployable has given us nuclear-free
zones, gender-based support groups, and the visible ruination of perfectly
good schools by infesting them with sub-standard teachers with not a thought
in their cotton-wool minds. The cost, reflected in local taxation, has
soared beyond the reach of public acceptability. Yet today Labour looks like
the competent party with sound ideas on local government; the Conservatives
are the knuckleheads.'
Perhaps for its next broadcast, the party might like to take highlights from
another recent FT column, by Samuel Brittan. He wrote: 'Unfortunately, it is
still not possible for market economists to support Labour with a straight
face.' There is no reproduction fee.

A city bank's economist visiting the Continent passed a butcher's displaying
various types of brains including, not only those of animals, but two
labelled 'Economist' and 'Sociologist'.
After recovering from his initial shock, he noted that the economist variety
was twice the price of the other. So he went in and told the butcher he was
pleased to see his profession's grey matter was so valuable.
'It's the supply factor,' the man replied. 'Brains in economists are very

Ruddy-cheeked Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of France's Front National, was in

rally, but his choice of music becomes ever more eccentric.
After a presidential campaign conducted to the stately chorus of the
Children of Israel from Verdi's Nabucco - ironic, considering the regularity
with which Le Pen is convicted for anti-semitic remarks - the theme song at
the rally was Elgar's Land of Hope and Glory.
Although preferable to Keep the Home Fires Burning, it was a curious way to

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WPP's Martin Sorrell has done valiant behind the scenes work in the run-up
to the boardroom coup at the Budgens supermarket chain, where he was the
only non-executive director. It was apparently his idea to bring in
Charterhouse to give the Budgens board independent advice, and WPP's Hill
and Knowlton public relations team was imported to add professionalism to a
messy affair.
True, Sorrell's role in extending the contracts of the top Budgens
executives after some abysmal results was surprising. But generally he seems
to have behaved as a model, if not holier-than-thou, non-executive director.
It is all a bit ironic. Sorrell, like erstwhile friend John Fletcher, is an
entrepreneurial Harvard MBA once able to persuade banks to lend him loads of
money for takeovers. Now Fletcher has been given the boot, will the
institutions turn their gaze on WPP?
Its shares have collapsed; the millenium may be over before it pays its next
ordinary dividend; and its board badly needs some new non-executive
directors.
Perhaps the Budgens affair was Sorrell's dress-rehearsal. Perhaps, too, more
will be revealed in WPP's accounts due at the month end.

What's so special about chief executives' desks? SQ Mile magazine, a new
quarterly glossy for City folk, has decided to find out. It has come up with
the rather quirky idea of handing a psychologist pictures of the desks of
captains of industry and finance, and asking him what they reveal about the
owner.
For instance, who's this?
'He is an analyst, first and foremost, a man of formidable intellect and
powers of cognate penetration. He reaches out and clutches the heart of the
matter in The Meeting, his assistants or enemies have long since lost their
nerves and minds. Never to his face, some unkind observers have described
him as a 'bit of a cold fish'.'
Answer: Sir Eric Parker, chief executive of Trafalgar House. Oddly enough,
SQ Mile belongs to Simon Broackes, son of Trafalgar House's ritzy Sir Nigel.
The magazine is also getting the psychologist to answer readers' queries.
The next, to be shrinked in the summer issue, is: How can I tell if my
managing director is mad? The questioner is 'a chairman'.

Barclays Bank has bagged another brace of corporate status-symbols for its
board. It now has a Japanese banker (Shijuro Ogata), and a high- flying
Dutchman (Jan Peelen), to display beside its erstwhile chancellor of the
exchequer and former civil-service head of the UK Treasury.
A big bank needs big directors and Barclays now has same in abundance.
Admittedly it's nowhere near as international as JP Morgan, with its well
connected international council and a top executive where foreign-born
bankers outnumber Americans 3-2. But it's streets ahead of the rest of the
UK clearers.
Barclays' choice of its new directors is interesting, given their Far
Eastern bias. Ogata was deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, and Peelen is
responsible for Unilever's East Asian and Pacific business.
The explanation may be that, having failed to crack the North American
market, Barclays is anxious to beef up its weak representation among the
world's fastest growing economies. For a bank clearly intent on thinking
big, perhaps the next step might be a Far Eastern acquisition.
Standard Chartered?

How seriously is the government committed to helping Britain's small
businesses? Less and less, their proprietors think, especially now the
Department of Employment's key policy unit for small firms is being exiled
to Sheffield.
Since the only member of its 30 staff going with it is a junior clerk,
continuity of policy is scarcely guaranteed. The rest, having declined to
leave the centre of 'Yes Minister' politics in London, are transferring to
other departments around the capital.
Small firms minister Eric Forth will also stay there, some 160 miles away
from his policy advisers - always assuming, of course, that some are found
to replace those who've jumped ship.
The official line is that the berths will soon be filled from the 40 staff
of the management-training section the small firms unit already has in
Sheffield, and others employed there by the former Training Agency now
broken up.
As trained civil servants, it is said, they'll have no trouble taking over
the helm. Moreover video conferencing and fax machines will bridge the gulf
between the new advisers and their minister in London.
While small-business lobby groups are not so sure, it's clearly a case of
time alone will tell. The move, by the way, is due to be completed by the
end of the month.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Arts: King Lear - Barbican Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have never liked King Lear. The rage is out of all proportion to the
reason. And while only a fool - a germane character in Lear - would deny
that there are great things in it, the play does not hang together as a
whole. However, I am aware that this is a minority opinion. Some people,
whose views I respect, think that is one of the greatest plays that has been
written. Almost any production is likely to offer new thoughts on it.
The Royal Shakespeare Company's production at the Barbican, directed by
Nicholas Hytner, is no exception. At first, it confirms one's own strongest
prejudices. It begins as a domestic drama. As in the same company's
production of Marlowe's Edward II, there is little to suggest the majesty of
a king. The characters quarrel about the number of retainers who can stay
under one roof. When King Lear goes out into the storm, one is reminded of
the Englishman's infatuation with talking about the weather. He must have
seen rain before, even as a king.
On the other hand, the second part is deeply moving. One of the keys to the
production is Linus Roache's Edgar, who has already emerged at the start as
an actor with staying power. He guides Lear through from mediocrity to
greatness. For Lear, played by John Wood, is a pretty nondescript monarch at
the beginning. As he gives up his kingdom, he scarcely stands out from the
rest of his court. Gloucester, too, is not much of a man until he has his
eyes put out.
Yet in the second part some of it comes together. Lear ages dramatically,
and with age come dignity and feeling. Gloucester develops as well. The
great stage at the Barbican takes on dimensions that were concealed when
Lear was in power. What you see now is the power of emptiness, as Gloucester
seeks to throw himself off the cliff and Lear wanders about. It is as though
the cliffs of Dover were the edge of the world. Edgar, disguised as a
madman, maintains sanity.
It is a pity, in a way, that we have to come back to the plot. The
production, again like that of Edward II, plays up the sex for all that it
is not worth. There is not much to said for Goneril and Regan: for all their
difference in hair-style, it is hard to tell them apart. They simply lust
after Edmund, who belongs to the unsatisfactory sub-plot. Cordelia is a
cypher. But, for a while, you have seen the full majesty of King Lear, the
play. At the last, John Wood rises to it magnificently.
In one other respect, the Edward II production comes to mind. It is
astonishing that the RSC can dress some performances, like Much Ado, so
well, yet others as if the costumes had come from a jumble sale. Someone
could perform a service by taking them off to Oxfam, and starting again.
Perhaps one of the City livery companies would help.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Arts: Nikolai Demidenko - Wigmore Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sternly impressive and evidently tireless, this pianist delivered a
well-filled programme last night. Enterprising, too: for such a virtuoso to
begin with three of Chopin's early, slighter polonaises was bold, even if
the great Polonaise-Fantaisie was to follow, but to play both Liszt's
Variations on 'Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen' and the ferocious Scherzo and
March after the interval looked like tempting fate. It wasn't, of course -
there is no doubt that Demidenko can play absolutely anything, and for as
long as you like.
It is unusual for a performer of such strength and lethal attack to be a
remarkable colourist too. Each of those early polonaises had its own
delicate tints, even the sturdier middle one (the posthumous no. 16 in
G-flat), and in their lacy precision there was no hint of a mailed fist
waiting to crash through.
Some honest winsomeness wouldn't have come amiss: salon charm is half the
point of this music, and Demidenko's lovely effects were very sober. With
the Polonaise-Fantaisie he established a far broader scale and drew its
elusive curves in long trajectories.
It was hugely refined, but not actually exciting (which may perhaps be
right). Two or three of Prokofiev's twenty Visions fugitives were too
extravagantly brilliant not to be exciting; but for the most part their
glint was cool and crystalline, without mischief or irony. That may be right
too, as Prokofiev's chosen epigraph - Balmont on 'rainbow colours' -
suggests, and certainly Demidenko's range of controlled hues was
fascinating.
He uses the pedal with rare imagination. Chorales eventually turn up in both
the Liszt pieces mentioned, and he found deep, weird sonorities for them; I
haven't heard their like. In the endless Variations he shifted instantly to
a new sound for almost every one, never dropping a stitch - and, as in the
diabolical Scherzo and March, with the wayward forms of the music kept
rigorously taut. The latter piece is saturnine and baleful to the point of
parody, and more than any other music here it seemed to satisfy Demidenko's
temperament perfectly.
Yet between these monstrous pieces he placed 'Francis of Assisi Preaching to
the Birds': breathlessly soft and feathery, no inapposite glitter in the
places where pianists generally can't resist it. Amid that marvellous
texture, the Saint's gentle sermon was sculpted with devotion - but without
conveying anything much like tenderness. I bet Liszt used to wring
everybody's withers with it. Demidenko is a disconcertingly cool customer.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Arts: From the Court of Ranjit Singh - A Sikh's taste in the
exhibition 'Warm and Rich and Fearless'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traditionally the Sikhs have been regarded as a people of limited aesthetic
sensibility. Rather in the way that the English perceived the Scots, they
were deemed tough farmers and fighters of legendary bravery with no time at
all for the liberal arts - at least until Ranjit Singh forged an autonomous
Sikh kingdom in the first years of the 19th century.
Warm and Rich and Fearless, which appears to be the first comprehensive
exhibition in Britain or India devoted to Sikh painting and applied art, at
Cartwright Hall in Bradford until June 2, should finally lay that myth to
rest.
BH Baden Powell described the Sikh artists' use of colour as 'Warm and Rich
and Fearless', a description perhaps as appropriate to the Sikhs themselves.
An introduction to Sikh history and culture is offered in the exhibition
catalogue, beginning with Nanak (1469-1539), the founder of the faith and
the first of its 10 gurus. The 100 or so exhibits - drawn from the V&amp;A, the
India Office Library, the Royal Collection and private collections - take up
the narrative some 300 years on.
Despite limitations of size and cost, and the quite understandable absence
of such evocative Sikh treasures as the Koh-i-noor diamond (then the largest
in the world) and Ranjit Singh's golden throne (in the V&amp;A) it is a
rewarding and enjoyable show.
Ranjit Singh's court provided the stability and patronage for the flowering
of Sikh art, its prosperity and lavish spectacle as much a magnet to the
Pahari artists of the Punjab hills as to foreign visitors. The Maharaja had
a taste for the grand gesture and a sensibility to the natural world -
ordering a 21-gun salute in honour of the moon, say, or halting meetings of
state to watch the formation of the monsoon clouds.
Yet the splendour of his court life, and the extravagance of such
peccadillos as drinking wine (forbidden by Sikh law) mixed with powdered
pearls, are at striking variance with his own unprepossessing and relatively
modest appearance.
Contemporary accounts emphasise his small stature and badly scarred face,
smallpox having blinded one eye and paralysed an arm and a foot. We find him
astride a prancing milk-white horse with hennaed fetlocks, his head shrunk
into his shoulders, his garb rich but simple. Prime minister Raja Dhian
Singh out on a hawking expedition cuts far more dash.
Such vibrant gouache miniatures of the mid-19th century are the glories of
the show. Appropriately they have been selected to represent artefacts also
on show or to reveal aspects of the Sikh character and way of life. A
manifestation of the egalitarianism that underpins Sikh culture, for
instance, is suggested by Raja Hira Singh's attendant who stands before his
master without the cringing deference found in Mughal painting. Two
cultivators - with water diviners? - allude to the Punjab as the granary of
India.
From the same set comes a painting of two Akalis - fiercely militant ascetic
Sikhs - portrayed bare chested in their prescribed shorts, with weapons
tucked into their conical turbans and brandishing clubs. Examples of the
terrifying razor-sharp steel quoits or Chakras that, when not spinning
through the air to fatal effect, were worn on their turbans, are here too.
Horse necklaces - and human jewellery - chain-mail armour and the
magnificent damascened shields of intricate koftgiri work are represented in
pigment and reality, the latter a speciality of Sikh craftsmanship until the
British banned the manufacture of weaponry in the Punjab.
Gradually a Sikh idiom emerges out of the synthesis of Mughal and Jain
painting. Curving lines and languor are abandoned in favour of sharper
angles, often provided by oversize parasols, and a new tension more
appropriate to Sikh manliness.
That said, there is a vestigial delicacy and fastidiousness in some images,
in the elegant poses, the bejewelled and spindly furniture based on English
Regency models, and in the delicate, stylised blooms.
Sikh painting shows a particular and sometimes penetrating portraiture. No
attempt has been made, for instance, to hide the charmlessness of Kaharak
Singh, Maharaja 1839-40. He resembles nothing so much as the frog-prince who
has not yet been kissed.
Sadly, we have only Hasan al-Din's uninspired portrait of the Maharaja
Duleep Singh, painted a few years before the Punjab was annexed by the
British in 1849 and the boy-king was forced to give up his throne, his
kingdom, the Koh-i-noor and, temporarily at least, his religion.
The watercolours and miniature portraits on ivory that follow, executed by
Indian and European artists, are disappointing. The exceptions are the
lithographs after drawings made by the Russian Prince Alexis Soltykoff in
the 1840s. Far more rewarding than the later watercolours are the golden
folk embroideries - the Phulkaris and Baghs - that continued to be made by
the Sikh women of the Punjab until early this century. Their deliberate
asymmetrical designs employ stylised motifs of everyday life - peacocks,
ears of wheat, coins, chillies, even railway engines.
Other textiles range from a Kashmir coat with lavish embroidery to Sikh silk
battle standards said to have been used in the final Anglo-Sikh war, and to
the contemporary shimmering, gauzy silk scarves confected by the
British-born Sikh Sarbit Natt, their handpainted designs drawing from the
geometries of traditional Phulkari.
The modern white nylon lace and even nastier synthetic red and gold brocade
used in the display of the manuscript of the Dasam Granth, the writings of
the last Sikh guru, are lamentable even without the contrast.
Modern Sikh art is also given a cursory nod, in the form of two paintings
recently given to Bradford. Paris-trained Amrita Sher-Gil, part Hungarian,
part Sikh, is represented by a haunting Portrait of a Woman of 1936, its
earthy tones reminiscent of the Buddhist cave paintings at Ajanta, and
Arpana Caur with his recent Time Image 2.
The exhibition can be seen at Walsall Art Gallery February 7 - March 27,
1992.

FT  03 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Chemical unions threaten series of
strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION LEADERS are threatening a series of strikes in the chemical industry
following the refusal of employers in national talks to reduce hours.
Mr Fred Higgs, national officer at the TGWU general workers' union, said
that if the talks broke down he and other union leaders would consider
building a fund for strike action at individual companies.
The threat follows the successful use of similar tactics in the engineering
industry after the break-down of national talks two years ago. The chemical
industry is one of the few which still has a national agreement, with talks
covering 25,000 workers in 100 companies.
This year the Chemical Industries Association has offered to increase pay by
6 per cent and is refusing to reduce the 38-hour working week.
Employers also want a deferment clause, to allow a pay pause for companies
in 'severe economic difficulties.'
The unions are seeking a pay increase at the rate of inflation, and are
pressing for a 'move towards' a 35-hour week over the next three years. In
the engineering industry many employers have agreed to a two-hour reduction
in the previous norm of 39 hours.
Mr Higgs, secretary of the joint council negotiating pay with the
association, said that unless there was substantial movement on the part of
the employers, there would be no settlement.
The unions are currently consulting with local branches and will tell the
association of the response in three weeks' time.
It said there was a strong feeling among members that there should be no
movement on hours. There were no plans to increase the financial offer.
Unions representing 1,200 employees of British Sugar are recommending
industrial action in protest against an 8 per cent offer.
The eight unions representing foremen, clerical staff and workers in
processing and packaging sites say that the proposed deal is an insult in
view of the company's profits.
The TGWU is recommending industrial action over a 5.75 per cent offer for
20,000 workers in wool textiles.
Lloyds Bank said it saw no room for manoeuvre on its 5 per cent offer to
non-managerial staff. Lloyds Group Union told the bank the offer was
difficult to justify in view of settlements elsewhere.

FT  03 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Tube strike talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROGER STRAKER, chief negotiator for London Underground, is pictured
arriving yesterday at Acas, the conciliation service, for talks aimed at
heading off next Thursday's planned 24-hour strike on the Tube.
London Underground said the discussions had been useful and it expected to
be involved in direct talks with the RMT and TSSA unions today, writes
Michael Smith. Yesterday Acas talked to the two sides separately.
Union leaders said the strike would go ahead on Thursday unless London
Underground dropped its plan to dismiss a total of 1,000 station staff.
Mr Straker said there was room for some optimism that the industrial action
might be avoided. The talks had given management 'food for thought'.
Mr Vernon Hince, RMT assistant general secretary, said it would take more
than London Underground simply reiterating its position to stop the strike.
Nevertheless, he said the union was prepared for realistic discussions in an
attempt to break the deadlock.

FT  03 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): UK and Ireland have longest work hours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AND Irish employees work longer hours than all other European
workers and the UK has among the lowest levels of statutory protection in
areas such as night work, rest periods and weekend work, a report to be
published next week will show.
Only the UK and Denmark, of the 17 countries examined, place no statutory
limit on the normal number of hours a worker may be asked to work in a week.
Limits in other countries vary from 48 in Germany and Italy to 39 in France.
According to the report, the UK is also the only country in western Europe
with no legal entitlement to paid annual leave. Entitlements in other
countries range from three weeks in the Irish Republic to five weeks in
Austria.
Britain is also unusual in having almost no restrictions on night work
hours, weekend working, rest breaks and overtime working, and no provisions
for employee participation in organisation of working hours. In nearly all
countries, the law provides for limits on overtime and all except the UK
have legislation providing for weekly rest periods.
The report coincides with attempts by the EC to establish European-wide
norms over working time by introducing, for example, rest periods between
shifts and possibly a maximum night shift of eight hours in any 24-hour
period.
The attempts are being resisted by the government, which believes employers
should decide.
The report found that the average British employee works 229 days a year,
compared with 231 in Ireland, 225 in Sweden - the average in Europe as a
whole - and 220 in Germany, the lowest for a European country.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Appeal fails to exclude evidence in Guinness trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO FORMER City merchant bankers facing criminal charges in the forthcoming
second Guinness trial have failed to exclude evidence they gave to
Department of Trade and Industry inspectors investigating the Guinness
affair.
Mr Roger Seelig, former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell, and
Lord Spens, former director of corporate finance at Henry Ansbacher, had
argued that it would be wrong and unfair to admit the evidence at the trial,
since the inspectors had not cautioned against self-incrimination.
Dismissing their appeal against a pre-trial ruling by Mr Justice Henry, Lord
Justice Watkins said in the Court of Appeal yesterday that the Crown set
great store by gaining the admission of the evidence, contending that it
amounted to confessions by the two men.
The appeal court upheld Mr Justice Henry's decision that DTI inspectors were
not 'persons . . . charged with the duty of investigating offences' within
the Police &amp; Criminal Evidence Act (Pace) and were therefore not obliged to
caution witnesses.
Lord Justice Watkins said that, even if the inspectors had been
investigating offences, and there had been a breach of the Pace code on
cautions, it would still have been open to Mr Justice Henry to admit the
evidence.
Mr Seelig and Lord Spens, who are likely to try to take their appeal to the
Law Lords, face charges of false accounting and offences under the
Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act over their alleged involvement in an
unlawful share support operation mounted by Guinness during its takeover
battle for Distillers in 1986.
The trial, already postponed since January, is due to start this month but
is likely to be delayed further.
Lord Justice Watkins said Mr Seelig alleged that there had been a conspiracy
between the inspectors, the DTI, the Serious Fraud Office and the police
that the inspectors would use their statutory powers not for the purpose for
which they had been appointed, but illegitimately to build a criminal case
against him.
Mr Seelig claimed that the police had suggested the inspectors' lines of
inquiry and deliberately delayed charging him until the inspectors had
finished interviewing him. He also alleged that the inspectors set out to
trap him into a confession at a time when, if questioned by the police, he
would have had to be cautioned and would have relied on his right to
silence.
The Crown said the inspectors did not have to caution or advise a witness
that he need not answer a question he thought would tend to incriminate him.
To impose any such obligation on inspectors would make their investigations
useless, the Crown contended.
Rejecting complaints that Mr Justice Henry wrongly exercised his discretion,
Lord Justice Watkins said the trial judge had decided that the fairness of
the trial would not be threatened by admitting the evidence, and that no
improper means had been used to force Mr Seelig and Lord Spens to give
evidence that might incriminate them.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Sir George Pollock, an architect of the CBI: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR George Pollock, QC, one of the principal architects and founders of the
Confederation of British Industry, has died aged 90.
Sir George, who ran away from school to join the merchant navy, later worked
as a journalist while he studied for the Bar.
He took silk in 1928 and in 1938 made legal history when he successfully
defended at petty sessions a woman on a murder charge. Previously, people
charged with murder had always been committed for trial at the assizes.
Sir George had a distinguished service record during the second world war,
which included a period preparing teams of saboteurs intended to operate if
Germany successfully invaded Britain.
After the war, he served in North Africa and Italy as a colonel on the
general staff and as chief judicial officer to the Allied Control
Commission.
In 1946, he became recorder of Sudbury but in 1954 left the Bar and began a
new career as director of the British Employers' Confederation.
In 1965, he was one of the guiding lights behind the merger of the
Confederation, the Federation of British Industries and the National
Association of Manufacturers into the Confederation of British Industry. He
later served as a senior consultant to the CBI on international labour
affairs and acted as the representative of British employers on the
governing body of the International Labour Organisation.
He was a member of the Donovan Royal Commission on Trade Unions' and
Employers' Associations from 1965 to 1968. He leaves a son and daughter from
the first of two marriages.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Bass to close two breweries as market changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASS, the UK's leading brewer, is to close two of its 13 breweries with the
loss of 480 jobs.
Production at Preston Brook, near Runcorn, Cheshire, and Springfield,
Wolverhampton, will end in August.
The move follows growing competition in the industry, with the government
forcing the leading brewers to free thousands of their pubs from 'tied' beer
supplies. Bass has begun to sell or lease about 2,600 of its pubs.
Commenting on yesterday's decision, Bass said that in a rapidly changing
beer market, cost efficiency was vital 'and scale economies are becoming
increasingly important'.
It added: 'Having evaluated the range of options, we have concluded that the
best solution is achieved by the closure of the breweries.' Production of
Springfield bitter and Charrington's IPA will be transferred from
Wolverhampton to Bass's Cape Hill brewery at Birmingham, where a Pounds 15m
programme to improve efficiency has been completed.
Runcorn's production of Carling Black Label lager and a wide range of other
beer brands will be redistributed among several of Bass's other breweries,
including Burton-upon-Trent, where some Pounds 50m has been invested in
improvements over the last four years.
Most of the jobs will go from the 20-year-old Preston Brook brewery, where
430 workers will be made redundant.
Mr Doug Henderson, a Labour trade and industry spokesman, said the Bass
decision was more evidence of the 'appalling state' of the brewing industry.
He said that he had urged the Office of Fair Trading to review the industry.
'If the government is at all concerned about what is happening in the
industry, it must act now,' he said.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Oil tax loophole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury yesterday announced legislation to close a potential loophole
in the taxation of oil companies.
In a written reply to a parliamentary question, Mr John Maples, economic
secretary to the Treasury, said: 'The government intends to bring forward
measures in the current Finance Bill aimed at preventing the circumvention
of the corporation tax ring fence around profits from North Sea oil by
schemes involving the use of 'stapled stock'.'
This follows a meeting last month between British Petroleum and Inland
Revenue officials to discuss proposals for BP to cut Pounds 150m from its
tax bill by issuing shares in its Britoil subsidiary to BP shareholders.
It planned to offer shareholders redeemable preference shares with a nominal
value in Britoil which would be stapled to BP shares. The shareholders could
then elect to receive a dividend payment from Britoil instead of from BP.
Under the plan BP would have gained the chance to offset the payments of
advance corporation tax it makes on dividends against Britoil's tax
liabilities.
The proposals take effect for distributions to shareholders on or after
yesterday.

THE GOVERNMENT may have sold parts of the state-owned National Bus Company
too cheaply and should have done more to ensure competition, according to a
report published yesterday by the House of Commons public accounts
committee, writes Neil Buckley.
The report says the taxpayer may not have received full benefit from the
sale of National Bus, which controlled 50 per cent of bus mileage in England
and Wales before it was privatised as 72 subsidiaries after the government's
deregulation of bus routes in 1985.
Some subsidiaries were sold to single bidders without valuations being

FT  03 MAY 91 / London hospitals prepare to operate under funding reforms:
The story behind the political storm over opt-out trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S cities have many examples of Victorian public buildings erected in
the grandiose style considered appropriate in an age of empire. They include
government offices, town halls - and hospitals.
The mid 19th century saw the start of Britain's biggest ever hospital
building programme, with the capital the natural location for many
substantial new hospitals. That was the start of the 'London problem' - the
overconcentration of hospital facilities in the capital - that has burdened
health planners throughout this century and surfaced again this week in the
political storm over job cuts at Guy's in south London.
London has eight teaching hospitals like Guy's, either on their original
city-centre sites or within a few miles of them. A shift in the capital's
population from the inner city to the suburbs and Home Counties has put
increasing pressure on health facilities in many outer districts, while
casting a logical question mark over the continued existence of so many big
central-London hospitals.
Generations of politicians have avoided pushing the 'London problem' to hard
conclusions - there are more votes to be lost than won from closing
world-famous institutions. The new funding arrangements contained in last
month's health reforms will make it harder for those conclusions to be
avoided.
All hospitals now pay capital charges on their land, buildings and
equipment. The high overhead costs of the big London hospitals will be
reflected in prices when contracts are negotiated with purchasing health
authorities. That will prove a strong incentive for health authorities
outside the capital to treat patients locally.
There is widespread recognition that a new plan for London's hospitals is
required. The case for rationalisation, however, is clearer than any visible
mechanism for securing it. There is no single health authority for London -
it comes within four health regions - and gathering information on a
capital-wide basis is a source of perpetual frustration for health
strategists.
The London hospitals straddle a vague line between serving their local
communities and acting as national research and training institutions. There
is uncertainty about the degree to which this ambiguous position contributes
to differences in medical staffing patterns - and consequently costs -
between London and the rest of the country.
In theory, at least, rationalisation could be left to the government's new
internal market and the competitive contract-based funding system. As Mr
Peter Griffiths, chief executive of the Guy's and Lewisham Trust, told his
staff when announcing the job cuts last week: 'If contracts are not won,
then the trust has no future.'
Many doctors and managers fear that an unrestrained scramble for contracts
would lead the London teaching hospitals into greater financial woes,
possibly destroying some specialist facilities by forcing concentration on
high-volume activities.
The latest attempt to impose order on London's hospital structure is being
made by the King's Fund health service charity. It has assembled an
influential group of health specialists to draw up a strategy for the future
of the capital's hospitals, taking account of such factors as the high level
of social deprivation in inner London and probable future shifts in
treatment patterns. The commission is due to begin publishing its findings
in the autumn.
Opposition speakers, meanwhile, yesterday continued to blame the financial
difficulties that have led to the proposed job cuts at Guy's and the
Bradford Hospitals trust on the government's health reforms.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, told a British Medical Association
meeting yesterday that it would be a 'scandal' if the government allowed
more hospitals to become self-governing trusts while it remained unwilling
to publish their business plans. 'The public,' he said, 'has a right to know
if in the search for commercial success the business plan of their local
opt-out hospital means cuts in services.'
Ministers say the application documents and business plans prepared by
potential trusts are internal working documents of a sort required in any
organisation.
Opponents are convinced that they cannot lose by continuing to press for
their publication. They believe that will demonstrate that the government
either knew many of the first 57 trusts would be financially unviable, or
granted self-governing status on the basis of vague and insufficient
information.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Record Pounds 239m Vauxhall profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VAUXHALL, the UK subsid-iary of General Motors, increased its pre-tax
profits last year to a record Pounds 239.1m from Pounds 236.3m a year
earlier.
The company was helped by favourable exchange-rate movements that cut
currency losses to only Pounds 3.2m from Pounds 29.3m in 1989.
Operating profits declined by 13 per cent to Pounds 190.9m from Pounds
219.7m a year earlier, chiefly under the impact of the recession in the UK
new car market.
Mr Paul Tosch, Vauxhall chairman and managing director, warned yesterday
that operating profits would fall further this year in the face of the
continuing steep drop in UK new car demand.
Marketing costs jumped last year as Vauxhall, along with rival car makers,
was forced to increase sales incentives sharply.
The company outperformed the market by holding the drop in UK car sales
volume to 7.7 per cent - 323,054 units - compared with a fall in the overall
market of 12.7 per cent.
Vauxhall, which ousted Rover from second place in the UK car market in 1989,
boosted its share further last year to 16.1 per cent from 15.2 per cent.
Vauxhall's financial performance was supported last year by a 16 per cent
increase in vehicle production to a record 276,000 units. UK-built cars
accounted for 80 per cent of sales, compared with 64 per cent in 1989.
The drop in domestic sales was cushioned by the start of exports to GM
markets in continental Europe.
Exports will be increased to 70,000 this year and will account for close to
30 per cent of Vauxhall's total production from its Luton and Ellesmere Port
assembly plants.
Vauxhall turnover rose last year by 4.9 per cent to Pounds 2.6bn, reflecting
the positive impact of the export programme. Net profits fell 13.3 per cent
to Pounds 181.3m from Pounds 209.1m, as the company faced a full-tax
payment, having exhausted its carry-forward losses in 1989.
It made a Pounds 184m dividend payment last year to GM, after one of Pounds
194.6m in 1989, its first for more than 20 years.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Cars rise by a third in 10 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of cars licensed to drive on British roads has risen by more than
a third from just over 15m in 1980 to 20.23m last year, according to the
latest annual vehicle census, published yesterday by the Department of
Transport.
During the same period, the number of motor cycles, mopeds and scooters fell
39 per cent from 1.37m to to 833,000.
The number of public transport vehicles increased by 5 per cent to 115,000,
but that is 13 per cent below its peak of 132,000 vehicles in 1988.
Licensed goods vehicles on the road, including most types of lorries and
vans, fell by 4.5 per cent compared with 1989. Figures have varied during
the decade, often in common with the state of the economy.
The number of cars on the road, by comparison, has risen every year since
1980 increasing by 3 per cent in 1990.
Simon Holberton writes: There are still significant benefits for employees
receiving company cars, but the recent tax changes in the Budget mean
companies and employees will have to be much more selective in future,
according to the top pay unit of Income Data Services, a pay research
organisation.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, increased tax charges on company cars by
20 per cent in his March Budget, making employers liable to National
Insurance on the benefit derived by employees.
Tax changes appear to have favoured those who receive a car as a benefit and
handicapped those provided with a car as a working tool.

THE BUYING of Blue Arrow shares by County NatWest, County NatWest Securities

believed, he told the Blue Arrow trial yesterday, John Mason writes.
Mr James Riddell, a former County financial control director, agreed that
the holdings - taken in the 1987 rights issue - were in three parcels to
avoid the disclosure requirements of the Companies Act. He agreed with Mr
Jeremy Roberts, QC, for Mr Jonathan Cohen, a former County chief executive,
that legal advice had been that that was possible.
Mr Riddell said that, in examining the accounting treatment of the Pounds
70m loss on the holdings after the stock market crash, he had 'always worked
from the framework that everything was legal'.
He presumed Mr Norman Berman, then NatWest's financial control director,
knew everything about the transaction.
County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips and Drew Securities
and seven individuals deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the
outcome of the Pounds 837m issue.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Signs of a recovery in the modern art market: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE market for contemporary art is being nursed slowly back to health by the
auction houses. On Wednesday night in New York, Christie's sold 53 paintings
and sculptures for Dollars 11m (Pounds 6.3m) but the auction was 25 per cent
unsold by value.
In a comparable sale last year, Christie's sold 11 works for more than
Dollars 1m - on Wednesday only three broke that barrier.
The highest price was Dollars 1.87m paid by the New York dealer Richard Gray
for West Brand, a black-and-white abstract expressionist canvas painted in
1960 by Franz Kline. Christie's had estimated this important work at between
Dollars 2m and Dollars 3m. Bait, by Robert Rauschenberg, made the same sum,
at the bottom of its estimate. Bidders are still light on the ground and
cautious.
The most expensive painting in the sale, Near Parnassus, by Cy Twombly,
which carried an estimate of between Dollars 3m and Dollars 4m, failed to
find a buyer, but Razzmatazz, a large Surrealist work by the Pop artist Roy
Lichtenstein, beat its forecast at Dollars 1.65m.
Sotheby's was selling less important contemporary art in New York on
Wednesday and was happy with a total of Dollars 7.2m and 17 per cent unsold.
Its two days of sales brought in Dollars 28.5m, and by persuading sellers to
accept lower estimates to match the fall in demand it managed to dispose of
most of the lots at the lower price levels.
While contemporary paintings recover, Chinese works of art continue to
command high prices. Sotheby's series of auctions in Hong Kong produced a
total of HKDollars 115.8m (Pounds 8.6m), with 7 per cent unsold.
In the final session, Mist at Dawn, a painting by Zhang Daqian, who died in
1983, sold for Pounds 155,685.
Furniture is one market that has not suffered too badly during the
recession, mainly thanks to buying by Continental dealers. A Belgian dealer
yesterday paid Pounds 13,750, comfortably above estimate, for a late Regency
rosewood breakfront bookcase at Christie's in Edinburgh.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Chancellor urges limited demands -
Public Expenditure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont yesterday warned his Cabinet colleagues that he is
determined to keep a tight grip on public spending as senior Whitehall
officials confirmed a drastic run-down in the Treasury's contingency
reserve.
The Chancellor was joined by Mr David Mellor, the chief secretary to the
Treasury, in what those present regarded as a ritual exhortation to spending
departments to keep down their bids for extra cash both this year and next
year.
His difficulties in holding the line against new spending demands, however,
was underlined by the publication by the Treasury of the latest independent
economic forecasts.
The forecasts suggest that unemployment is likely to average around 2.4m in
the current financial year against the 1.75m assumed by the Treasury when
the public spending targets were set.
If the higher figures prove accurate - and ministers are not disputing them
in private conversations - then the additional cost in benefits will be over
Pounds 2bn.
A further Pounds 700m of the Treasury's Pounds 3.5bn reserve for the current
1991/91 financial year has already been committed to pay for
higher-than-expected public sector pay awards, the decision to uprate child
benefit, and additional training measures.
That has led senior Whitehall officials to predict that on current trends
the Government will overshoot both its Pounds 205bn public spending target
and its Pounds 8bn borrowing target.
It has also raised serious doubts about the credibility of the Pounds 220bn
figure pencilled in by the Treasury for 1992/93, despite the existance of a
much larger reserve of Pounds 7bn for that year.
Downing Street indicated yesterday that the plans for next year could
benefit from lower-than-expected inflation. In the short term at least, the
Treasury will actually benefit from the Gulf War.
A sizeable proportion of the contributions from Britain's coalition allies -
to replace capital equipment like Tornado fighter planes - will not actually
be spent for some years.
Against that, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, was said at
Westminster to be joining his colleagues at health, education and
environment in preparing substantial bids for next year.
Back-of-the-envelope calculations in Whitehall suggest that demands for next
year will total upwards of Pounds 10bn and perhaps as much as Pounds 15bn.
Mr John Cunningham, shadow leader of the House, accused the Government in
the Commons yesterday of seeking to avoid a debate on its public expenditure
plans.
He recalled that the opposition had been pressing for such a debate for
three months,and claimed that ministers were embarrassed over the deepening
recession and reports that it might have to cut investment programmes.
Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, told him the government would be
happy to defend its position.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Government 'ready to talk' in move
to calm NHS row - Prime Minister's Questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MINISTERS are to have a fresh round of consultations with doctors' leaders
in a bid to defuse the mounting criticism of the changes in the national
health service introduced last month.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, announced his readiness to have
discussions with representatives of the BMA in the Commons yesterday.
He again came under fierce attack from Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader,
who endorsed the BMA's verdict that the Government's reform of the NHS had
resulted in a 'crisis' for doctors and patients.
The prime minister clearly hopes that by the time he meets the doctors later
in the year, the initial outcry over the cuts announced by hospitals which
have opted out of control by local health authorities by becoming
self-governing trusts will have faded.
Mr Major recalled that the BMA had clashed with Conservative and Labour
politicians from the time the NHS was established in 1948.
Emphasising that the government was seeking to secure more value for money,
he urged the doctors to accept that it was 'improbable' that the entire
Pounds 30bn a year being spent on the NHS was being used to best effect.
He said: 'The purpose of our reforms is to ensure that money is used to the
best effect on patient care, and to ensure that the patient gets the best
possible value for the contribution he makes to the health service'.
The prime minister condemned the local government workers' union (Nalgo) for
using 'phoney pictures and fake statistics' in newspaper advertisements
attacking the health service reforms.
He claimed that their content was similar to 'so much from what we are
hearing from the Labour Party'.
Mr Kinnock interpreted this charge as a sign of the prime minister's
'desperation' and proof of the BMA's case that 'you really do not know what
is going on in the country'.
tary of the BMA, had complained that the reforms introduced by the
government had resulted in hospital clerks having to take 'life and death
decisions' on the admission of patients to hospitals.
The prime minister suggested that Dr Field should have looked to those parts
of the country where hospital trusts were not seeking cuts but expanding
staff.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Evans the candidate fights history
 -Tory prospects for the Monmouth by-election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WOMEN filling envelopes and ticking off charts in the Conservative
central committee rooms in the little market town of Usk must be hoping
Henry Ford was right when he said history is bunk.
Mr Roger Evans, a 43-year-old London barrister with a five-star Welsh name,
is defending a 9,350 Tory majority in this stunningly beautiful constituency
at the bottom end of the Welsh marches, the golden triangle encompassed by
Monmouth, Abergavenny and Usk, where the money of Wales lives.
History is against Mr Evans. Not since October 1945 have the Tories won a
by-election in Wales. And he is the third Mr Evans in a row to fight a
by-election for the Tories - other Evanses lost in Ribble Valley and Neath.
Four years ago, Sir John Stradling Thomas, whose death earlier this year
precipitated the by-election on May 16, saw the opposition divided almost
equally.
Labour was slightly ahead of the then SDP candidate with 13,037 votes to
ll,313. For either Labour or the Liberal Democrats to mount a challenge to
the Conservatives, it must effectively wipe the other out.
The contest has taken on additional significance coming so soon after the
local council elections, and indications are that Labour's 38-year-old Huw
Edwards, another good Welsh name and another outsider - he is a lecturer at
Brighton Polytechnic - is taking votes in handfuls from the Liberal
Democrats' Mrs Frances David, the only local among the three.
An early poll suggested that Labour was winning not only this contest within
a contest but also shading the Tories for first place.
Labour is strongest where the constituency butts on to Newport and the
bottom end of Gwent's industrial valleys, where the voters work, or get a
living from, the nearby Llanwern steelworks or the new town of Cwmbran.
Mr Edwards has not only to hold this base but also win votes from the
disgruntled farmers who live in and around Welsh-sounding villages such as
Llanfoist, Llantilio and Llangwm. Welsh sounding, but very English, with a
lot of the voters commuting to Cardiff and Bristol.
Apart from the market towns like Monmouth, Ragland, Abergavenny and Usk, Mr
Edwards also has to win votes in the neat estates of Chepstow, where the
Severn bridge touches down in Wales, which because of its cheaper housing
has become something of a dormitory for Bristol.
It is a big hill to climb. The poll tax has disappeared as an issue, and the
main concern outside the farms, where there are worries over the drop in
incomes, appears to be the future of the health service, which Labour is
working to the full.
Strangely, the Conservatives appear to campaigning in a low key, almost
offhand. Welsh secretary Mr David Hunt has visited the constituency, as has
party chairman Mr Chris Patten, but there is no evidence of the urgency
needed if the party is not to suffer another Ribble Valley, where a much
larger majority went up in smoke.
Visually, too, there is a strange apathy among the Conservatives. As a
country area the Tories normally put their candidate's window bills on
posts, rather like estate agents' boards, along the roadside. In 1987 they
were everywhere. Now, in most places, they are heavily outnumbered by the
For Sale signs outside the houses of those seeking to move on.
By contrast, Labour's headquarters in a former school in Chepstow is
bursting with life. Not only are many big names paying a visit - Mr Neil
Kinnock, Mr Jack Straw, Dr Jack Cunningham, Mr Tony Blair, Ms Glenda Jackson
 -but backbench MPs aplenty are there.
Both the Greens and Plaid Cymru, the Welsh Nationalists. are represented by
Mr Mel Witherden, who has refused to be photographed in one of the many
markets in case it offended his vegetarian supporters. Presumably, he would
be happy with the farmers in their cabbage fields.
If Mr Evans is looking for an omen there is one that might just come in
handy.
When the Tories last won a by-election in Wales, all those years ago, it was
in Monmouth. The winner, the redoubtable Peter Thorneycroft went on to
become Chancellor of the Exchequer and chairman of the Conservative party,
and held the seat for 21 years.
If he had known that perhaps even Henry Ford might have drawn a different
conclusion.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Scotland lays plans for business: The issues facing the new
enterprise bodies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Crawford Beveridge is the latest government appointee to wrestle with the
'Scottish phenomenon' - the fact that Scots run big businesses the world
over, not least in England, while in the home country entrepreneurship is
sluggish.
Mr Beveridge is an example of the phenomenon. He is also the man responsible
for the machinery that could tackle it. He was born 44 years ago in
Edinburgh and has spent most of his working life abroad in senior managerial
jobs with US electronics companies. Recently he returned to Scotland from
California, where he worked for Sun Microsystems, the computer workstation
maker which has expanded greatly since its creation in 1982.
Mr Beveridge is chief executive of Scottish Enterprise (SE), the new body
that has taken over from the Scottish Development Agency and the Training
Agency to run business development and training in Scotland. Many of its
powers are in the hands of 13 local enterprise companies (Lecs), the
Scottish equivalent of the training and enterprise councils (Tecs) in
England.
True, SE operates from the old Glasgow offices of the SDA but the
similarities end there.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, eager to encourage the Lecs with their
private sector boards, and anxious to compensate them for big cuts in
training funds this year by the Department of Employment, has urged SE to
allocate as much as possible of its budget to the Lecs.
SE gave all but 17 per cent of its Pounds 430m budget to the Lecs and admits
it has left itself rather short. 'It leaves us at some risk,' Mr Beveridge
says.
SE dispenses money to the Lecs and authorises how they spend it. It also
still has the strategic development responsibilities of the old SDA, such as
attracting inward investment through the Locate in Scotland bureau, planning
industry-wide initiatives and handling large property and environmental
improvement projects. Whereas the Lecs drafted their business plans last
autumn, SE is still working on its own first-year plan.
'We'll be OK for money on Locate in Scotland but short on property and
environment, as well as on development finance for investing in companies,'
Mr Beveridge says.
He points out that recession is reducing investment opportunities of all
kinds, and so far the SE core staff is between 60 and 70 below its
theoretical strength of 430, because SDA staff have left or moved out to
Lecs while some civil servants from the Training Agency have refused to
join. Morale is said to be low.
Mr Beveridge does not believe that the Lecs will be able to spend all the
money allocated. Several are starting from scratch, and in recessionary
times projects involving the private sector tend to be slow to go ahead.
He will review the Lecs' spending progress each quarter. Mindful that the
Treasury requires official bodies to spend their budgets within the
financial year, he will then 'enter negotiations with them' - the Lecs are
independent companies - 'to move money around to where it is most likely to
be spent,' including the SE core.
In Inverness, Highlands and Islands Enterprise has succeeded the Highlands
and Islands Development Board and has a smaller-scale structure similar to
Scottish Enterprise, with nine Lecs scattered from Shetland to Argyll. Much
more power has been retained at the core here.
A veteran of the HIDB says: 'Our Lecs are very small and inexperienced and
they need a lot of help from us.' The Scottish Office makes Highland Lecs
obtain authorisation from HIE if they wish to spend more than Pounds 15,000,
whereas the limit for SE's Lecs is Pounds 250,000.
Mr Iain Robertson, the 40-year-old new chief executive, another expatriate
Scot who saw an advertisement for his new job in the Financial Times while
working for British Petroleum in Cleveland, Ohio, wants his Lecs to have
more independence. 'The whole point of the change is to put power into the
hands of the communities so that they can no longer say: 'No one ever asked
us, the decisions are taken in Inverness or Edinburgh.' I'm determined the
Lecs will get more autonomy as things go on.'
Still, he admits that only about 25 per cent of HIE's budget is initially
going to Lecs, although further allocations are being held in reserve. Most
of the HIDB staff have transferred to HIE, including Mr Robertson's
predecessor, so the shake-up has been less traumatic than at SE. Others say
the old guard from the HIDB have dug themselves in to preserve
centralisation.
HIE has already drawn up its strategic plan, which recognises that the
population of the Highlands is rising for the first time for a century and
that the big development projects of the past, such as an aluminium smelter
at Invergordon, near Inverness, survived for only a few years, leaving high
unemployment. 'People are coming back and we've got to provide jobs for
their children that are in tune with the place,' says Mr Robertson, looking
at small-scale industry, tourism and fish farming.
Back at SE, Mr Beveridge's preoccupations are with strengthening indigenous
business and developing a long-term strategy. 'There is much more indigenous
business going on here in Scotland than I thought there was looking from
outside,' he says. 'And there's a fantastic number of smart people.
'But there are no Sun-sized new Scottish companies,' he says, referring to
his California days. 'And the boundaries of the ambitions of the small
companies often seem to stop at Carlisle. Not many have a world view, or
even an EC view. Something stops them from having these worldwide
ambitions.'
Then there is his worry about what Scotland will develop or import to
replace the current wave of high-technology industries that have
successfully replaced the old industrial economy of coal, shipbuilding and
steel. He envisages assembling a think tank to help to devise a plan.
Is Scottish Enterprise the answer to Scotland's economic worries? 'There
will be time to look back and see if this was a sensible idea, but not for
about two years,' he says.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Brewery donates site for Edinburgh tourist project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH &amp; Newcastle Breweries is donating the 10-acre site of a former
brewery next to Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh to help fund a tourist project
aimed at enhancing the city's historic centre.
Mr James Scott, of Scottish Enterprise, the new government body working for
the development of the Scottish economy, said the donation of the land by
S&amp;N and an adjoining 1.5-acre site by British Gas 'represents corporate
generosity on a scale not seen before in Scotland'.
Chartered surveyors said the land might be valued at up to Pounds 5m on the
open market, depending on the purpose for which it was developed. It has
been contaminated by industrial use.
The centrepiece would be a Pounds 15m building named the Younger Universe
after one of S&amp;N's brands of beer. It would house a visitor attraction
entitled The Dynamic Earth, explaining the creation of the planet and the
threats it faces. It might attract 500,000 visitors a year.
The Younger Universe would be financed from the sale of the rest of the site
to developers. The plan envisages building quality offices, small workshops,
housing and a 150-bedroom hotel aimed at improving a rundown area of
Edinburgh.
S&amp;N is handing the site over to the Holyrood Brewery Foundation, a
charitable trust, which will seek planning permission for the project. The
cost of the entire development will be about Pounds 100m and it could be
completed in 1994.
Scottish Enterprise is making grants of more than Pounds 5m available,
partly for site reclamation.
Mr Alick Rankin, chairman of S&amp;N, said he was sure his shareholders would
appreciate the company's decision not to sell the site. The donation was a
recognition of the benefit the company had gained from this part of
Edinburgh and was likely to contribute to the affluence of Scotland.
Mr Michael Hopkins, the architect responsible for the new stand at Lord's
cricket ground, is designing the Younger Universe. It will include a
stretched membrane roof resembling a tent.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Old county names may return to Welsh map
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON, Welsh correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has rejected calls for an elected assembly for Wales as part
of proposed local-government reform in the principality - and opted instead
for a reorganisation bringing back many of the old county names.
The assembly idea, which is supported by the Labour party, has been rejected
by Mr Nicholas Bennett, the Welsh Office junior minister with responsibility
for local-government matters.
Instead, the government is proposing to reorganise the eight counties and 37
districts into 19 unitary authorities.
Under the proposals, some old county names such as Pembrokeshire,
Breconshire and Anglesey will return.
The Welsh county and district authorities agree on the need for single-tier
authorities to replace the present two, but there is little common ground on
which tier should be the foundation of the new structure. At a meeting last
month with Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, each proposed the abolition
of the other.
Mr Hunt is now suggesting that the capital, Cardiff, and the three main
towns - Swansea, Newport and Wrexham - should in effect revert to their
status before the 1974 reorganisation.
He is also proposing that the vast county of Powys, which covers the whole
of largely rural mid Wales, should be covered by six authorities.
In the north, Gwynedd would be abolished, with Anglesey reverting to its
pre-1974 position and the remainder called Caernarfon. Clwyd would remain as
a name, but it would lose Wrexham.
The present county of Mid Glamorgan would remain as a unit, but it would
lose Merthyr Tydfil, which would revert to its pre-1974 borough status.
In the west, Dyfed would be abolished, part going to form Ceredigion and the
rest returning to the old names Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire.
Mr Hunt is to hold meetings with the local authorities in the next few weeks
and further fine tuning is possible.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Council Elections: Liberal Democrats prove capacity to
surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIBERAL Democrats proved once again last night their capacity to
surprise by out-performing the party's national opinion poll rating and
confounding gloomy predictions about its local election campaign.
As results came in last night, Liberal Democrat strategists sipped champagne
and rapidly revised projections of net losses for the party on seats it won
in 1987. Party officials congratulated themselves on making substantial net
gains after a campaign dominated by clashes on national issues between
Labour and the Conservatives.
Projections based on early results suggested the Liberal Democrats were
winning, perhaps, more than 20 per cent of the vote - compared with recent
opinion polls putting the party on about 14 or 15 per cent. Early this
morning the party was exceeding Labour in terms of net gains of seats.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, was able to claim vindication for
his strategy of concentrating efforts and resources in target areas -
notably Gosport, Hampshire, and Eastbourne, East Sussex, where the party
notched early victories. He was also able to claim, with some justification,
that in large areas of southern England, the Liberal Democrats, were the
only challengers to the Tories.
By taking control of - among others - Lewes in East Sussex, North Wiltshire,
North Devon, and Torbay in Devon the party more than fulfilled its promise
to increase its 'power and influence' where it already had a strong base.
'The Liberal Democrats are the clear winners tonight,' Mr Ashdown said.
'Where the Tories have to be beaten the Liberal Democrats are the clear and
powerful challengers.'
The party's campaign was deliberately different to Labour and the Tories,
concentrating on local issues and the party's strength at 'grassroots'
politics. The results further cemented the bonds between the old Liberal
party and the Social Democrat party which formed the Liberal Democrats after
the last general election.
Last year's local election results, where the party won about 16 per cent of
the vote, encouraged hopes that the damaging rifts at the time the merger
had been overcome.
The Eastbourne by-election, followed soon after by success in Ribble Valley,
brought further cheer. Last night's results suggest that period can be
relegated to the history books.
They will also encourage Mr Ashdown in his strategy of looking for a gradual
strengthening in his party's standing - rather than hoping for a frothy dash
for growth. Officials said the party had also made impressive gains in areas
of the country where it had not focused efforts.
What the Liberal Democrat party still has to prove is that it can displace
Labour as the main challenger to the Tories in more than a handful of seats
in the midlands and north England.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Council Elections: Labour sets the stage to take elections'
Oscar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF LOCAL elections have been a test of open government, Labour would be a
shoe in. Or would they?
After days of dispute as to what a variety of possible results might mean,
the Tories chose to keep their teams of analysts strictly behind closed
doors.
Conservative Central Office in Smith Square was bathed in television
floodlight but this illustrated only the party's public face - the
building's elegant neo-Georgian facade and its equally well-turned-out
landlord, Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman.
As Mr Patten darted between camera crew or radio car, the actual
number-crunching was kept close to the party's chest. Independent observers
hungry for news had to content themselves with sandwiches and instant coffee
served in a closely guarded back room far from the real action.
Reports of champagne at Walworth Road - south London headquarters of the
Labour Party - were premature, although the very beating heart of the
electoral machine was freely on display to the cameras.
The boardroom - in far-off times the scene of fearsome faction fighting -
was now a hive of unified, comradely endeavour. Bleeping television monitors
watched over some 20 analysts umbilically tied to the phone lines relaying
results from regional headquarters. Elsewhere in the room, Miss Glenda
Jackson (observers had been promised celebrities) chatted to Mr Jack
Cunningham, the train and limo lagged national campaigns co-ordinator.
In another corner, a dot-matrix announcer board winked out the latest
triumphs. But only triumphs. There was a sneaking suspicion that resounding
victories were slipping through the well-oiled machinery a little more
smoothly than the less encouraging figures.
It was only in whispers on the stairs that bad news from Calderdale in West
Yorkshire was told.
All understandable, perhaps, and certainly a more social occasion than tea
and biscuits with the Tories. But at moments, under the lights, there was
the inkling the room had something in common with a stage set.
The camera may never lie but the feverish activity in front of the
television crews was sometimes vaguely reminiscent of the days when
newsreaders used to work against a 'newsroom' background of shadowy figures
carrying files.
For sheer drama, however, Labour's show was an Oscar winner, even though we
never saw the champagne.

overall control.
To gain outright control of an authority a party must have half the seats
plus one. Some councils listed as 'no overall control' are effectively
controlled by a party where it has an overall majority on the mayor or
chairman's casting vote, or by agreement with a minority party.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Council Elections: Left-wing rebels win five Liverpool seats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEFT-WING labour rebels standing against official Labour candidates took
five out of six seats in the Liverpool council elections.
The six were either retiring Labour councillors already suspended from the
party or local nominees opposed to Liverpool's moderate Labour leadership.
The moderates were standing against the background of a series of strikes
aimed at stopping 1,000 redundancies among council workers. They
nevertheless improved their grip on the council with a gain from the Liberal
Democrats, the defeat of one of the rebels and the replacement of another in
a ward that remained loyal.
The rebels, their nominators and supporters now face expulsion from the
Labour Party. A report will be ready next week for submission to the May
meeting of Labour's national executive committee. Up to 100 people are
expected to be named.
Labour may also challenge the results in the election court, which can
disqualify winners if misconduct can be proved. Officials said early today
they had clear evidence of rebels misrepresenting themselves as official
candidates and confusing voters.

JAPAN'S Ministry of Trade and Industry yesterday announced a unique
cooperation programme under which Japanese agencies would finance up to
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 592m) worth of US sales over the next 11 months.
US officials say the programme, in co-operation with the US Export-Import
Bank, is 'a political decision' by the Japanese government to help reduce
the US trade deficit and to use Japanese capital to help defuse bilateral
trade frictions.
'This will go on the positive side of the ledger,' said Mr Ray Albright,
vice president of Eximbank's Asia division.
In the first arrangement of its kind, MITI and Eximbank said the Japanese
funds would be used mostly to support joint US-Japanese projects, though
help will be provided for US businesses in some other programmes.
The Ministry will fund local costs of infrastructure in third world
countries, for example, to promote projects purchasing US goods or services.
It will also provide insurance for third country projects and financial
institutions which advance financing to US exporters. It will assist small
US businesses by offering pre-export insurance when advanced payment is
required.
Medium and long term financing will be available from the Japanese
Export-Import Bank for US exports to Japan.
Mr Eugene Lawson, Eximbank vice president, said that besides promoting US
exports to Japan, the programme will help sustain trade and investment flows
to developing countries and increase cooperation between suppliers and banks
in both the US and Japan.
Mr Albright sees the programme as a natural outgrowth of the growing
cooperation between US and Japanese companies which increasingly have been
bidding jointly. Projects in Mexico, Indonesia and Thailand are expected to
require such cofinancing 'in the near future.'
Mr Lawson said Japan may, in future, establish similar cooperative
programmes with the export credit agencies of other countries.
Lucas, the international engineering group based in the West Midlands of the
UK, has extended its penetration of the US defence market with a contract to
supply harpoon missile capsules worth at least Pounds 25m over the next five
years, reports Paul Cheeseright.
The defence fabrications division of Lucas Aerospace won the contract from
McDonnell Douglas Missile Systems.

FT  03 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Environmentalists start to call tune in US
 -Awareness of green issues is forcing world institutions to clean up their
acts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR years US administrations have virtually ignored a Canadian request for a
clean-up of toxic wastes going into the Niagara River, which serves as the
border between Ontario and New York state.
Yet now, the Bush administration is putting pressure on Mexico to enforce
its environmental laws and pledging to increase bilateral environmental
co-operation while negotiating a North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta)
with Mexico and Canada.
Increasingly, environmentalists are focusing on trade issues in their
efforts to protect air and water, the ozone layer, fragile forests and
endangered species. In Congress, they receive respectful attention from
members, most of whom campaign as environmentalists.
The difference is more than the disparities between two industrialised
countries and between the richest country in the world and its impoverished
neighbour. What has changed is both the heightened awareness that
unregulated economic growth produces ecological disaster and the growing
political clout of the US environmental movement.
Environmentalists led the successful drive for a ban on ivory to save the
elephant and forced a US ban on Mexican tuna.
The World Wildlife Fund, the world's largest private conservation
organisation, joined forces with zoos, bird breeders and the American pet
industry to end the Dollars 40m US trade in exotic birds in danger of
extinction.
The Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC) is fighting against the
proposed import of Siberian logs, saying the logs contain exotic insects and
diseases which, if introduced, could decimate American forests.
Environmentalists moved from individual trade issues to multilateral
concerns when they turned their attention last year to the Uruguay Round.
Alarmed by the drive to harmonise food safety rules, they went to Geneva to
warn that lax international standards on food imports were in danger of
superseding stricter national or state regulations. They urged negotiators
not to bargain away a nation's right to allow product bans for humanitarian
or social reasons.
Thus far, they have displayed their greatest strength on Nafta. Anxious to
break up the environmental-farmer-labour coalition against the renewal of
President George Bush's 'fast track' authority, the administration on
Wednesday offered them a series of concessions in an 'action plan' submitted
to the Congress.
Most satisfying, according to Mr Glen Prickett of the NRDC, was an agreement
to conduct an in-depth review of US-Mexico environmental issues, allowing
input by the environmental groups before the Nafta negotiations end.
NRDC wants to go even farther. It is preparing to recommend creation of a
multilateral environmental commission that would administer trade sanctions
for environmental enforcement lapses; set requirements for emissions
reporting and monitoring of polluting industry; enable 'citizen enforcement'
of pollution standards; and conduct environmental impact assessments.
Some analysts believe this is just the beginning. Mr Brad Larschan, a
Washington lawyer, says the issues involved in trade are moving away from
the traditional frictions to those not addressed by multilateral agreements.
'Environmental enforcement is an issue of comparative advantage,' he said.
'Those that don't have it subsidise their industries. Those who do tax their
industries. Over the next decade these issues will become increasingly
prominent in trade disputes.'
Mexico's trade minister, Mr Jaime Serra Puche, has welcomed the US
president's assurances to Congress that a free trade agreement between the
two countries will not harm the environment or workers' rights, writes
Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
Mr Serra was 'very pleased' that the 80-page document sent to Congress on
Wednesday 'recognised the economic advances made in Mexico' in the past few
years, and that it shattered the myths about Mexico's labour and
environmental standards.

FT  03 MAY 91 / World Trade News: World Bank grapples with hazy demands of
greens

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NO SINGLE issue has given the World Bank more bad publicity over recent
years than its record over environment. This criticism has brought change in
an institution that up to the late 1970s was dominated by civil engineers.
No World Bank project now goes ahead without an assessment of its
environmental consequences.
Even its critics agree that the bank has cleaned up its environmental act in
the last few years.
However they believe the issue is still not central enough to bank thinking.
Environmental issues are still something of an afterthought, say critics
such as Mr John Cavanagh from the Institute of Policy Studies in Washington.
Sustainability, says Ms Sandra Postel of the Worldwatch Institute, a US
pressure group, should replace growth as the main objective of economic
policy.
The environment is one of a number of newer development issues which is
complicating the bank's task and making the institution potentially more
intrusive in decision-making in developing countries.
Responding to environmentalists' demands can be difficult: the concepts they
have introduced are hard to counter but soft in definition. What does
'sustainable development' mean exactly? Mr Cavanagh speaks of the importance
of development being equitable and involving popular participation. But
these too are hazy concepts.
Practically the issue is difficult because environmental problems have to be
tackled through many agencies, both inside and outside government.
There is still a quite fundamental split between the bank and its
environmental critics over economic growth. Bank officials are still
interested in 'increasing the size of the pie', reckoning this helps to
erase poverty, thereby eliminating an important source of environmental
degradation.
The traditional market-based growth model now in vogue almost worldwide is,
however, rejected by many environmentalists as a cause rather a cure of
environmental problems. For example, Mr Cavanagh suggests environmental
deterioration in fast-growing Taiwan is not far removed from that under the
communists in east Europe.
Many environmental problems could be eased in a simple fashion - by relying
more on market pricing. Poland, Mr Larry Summers, the bank's new economist,
notes, was an exporter of tropical flowers because energy there was priced
at one-tenth of the world price. The environmental cost may have been so
heavy that producing the flowers was reducing gross national product -
so-called negative value added.
He also rejects much of the environmentalists' concern with the depletion of
scarce resources. Commodity prices are sending the opposite message - they
have fallen in real terms in the last 10 to 20 years.
Economics has also given potential answers where the price mechanism breaks
down because external costs are not factored in: for example, the idea of
auctions for 'permits to pollute'. He says it is 'foolish to deny any
substantial amount of tropical forest damage has anything to do with
incentives.'

FT  03 MAY 91 / Food supply for 1m in Ethiopia enough for just 10 days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOD STOCKS for over 1m people in Ethiopia will be exhausted in ten days,
the British charity Oxfam said yesterday, warning that without fresh
supplies the country's death toll would exceed the 1984 famine, Michael
Holman, Africa Editor writes.
'What I have seen has shaken me. It is even worse than I expected. The
suffering is already acute,' said Mr Frank Judd, Oxfam director who is on a
fact finding mission to Ethiopia, where civil wars threaten the government
of President Haile Mariam Mengistu.
'The dying could soon overshadow that of 1984 unless action is taken
immediately. The priorities are obvious: food, transport, water, medical
supplies and shelter.' Around 1m Ethiopians are estimated to have died in
the 1984-85 famine.
Accusing leading donors of 'dragging their feet', an Oxfam statement said
that only half the total food needs of Ethiopia for the year has been
pledged, and much less than that have been delivered by the main donors.
The European Community was still debating ways to fund 400,000 tonnes of
food aid which had been agreed to in principle 'more than two weeks ago',
said the charity.
In the west of the country there is only 14 days' food left for 300,000
refugees from Sudan, and in the northern Ogaden region, at least 500,000
Somali refugees have only 14 days supply left.
A further 200,000 Ethiopians who have returned from Ethiopia are also facing
'severe shortages', while relief efforts for 380,000 drought victims in
southern Ogaden are 'severely hampered by appalling road conditions.'
In the region of north Omo, 400,000 people 'are facing starvation' due to
crop failure, and the number is expected to almost double, says Oxfam.

FT  03 MAY 91 / PM mediates pay deal to clear way for Australian port reform
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S waterfront reform programme appeared to be back on course
yesterday after employers and unions ended a pay dispute following all-night
negotiations chaired by Mr Bob Hawke, the prime minister.
Mr Hawke emerged from nearly 18 hours of non-stop talks in Sydney to
announce a deal which could clear the way for changes in manning
requirements and work practices in ports around Australia.
The deal must be ratified by the waterfront employers' association, the
Waterside Workers' Federation, the main dockside union, and the Industrial
Relations Commission, the national labour court.
However, it represents a significant political victory for Mr Hawke, who has
made waterfront reform a key element in a wider programme of structural
reform of the economy.
The prime minister intervened in the dispute after the Australian Council of
Trade Unions (ACTU) blocked waterfront reform in protest at a 2.5 per cent
ceiling on wage increases imposed across industry by the Commission.
The Commission's ruling conflicted with an earlier agreement between the
ACTU and the government, known as the Accord, under which workweek, plus
further productivity-backed payments and improved superannuation.
The deal reached yesterday excludes superannuation, but provides for most
other elements of the Accord, including the ADollars 12 payment. Waterfront
workers will also receive a further 6.12 per cent pay increase over two
years, provided reforms are agreed and implemented.
The unions agreed to ask the Commission to ratify the deal, removing
employers' fears that an agreement struck outside the framework of the
centralised wage fixing system could reduce their legal protection from
industrial disruption.
Mr Richard Setchell, managing director of Conaust, the biggest stevedoring
company, said the unions' agreement to deliver reform before receiving
productivity increases represented a significant breakthrough.
'They will get nothing, other than the ADollars 12, unless they come up with
the goods. That is a huge contrast with the past 50 years,' he said.
Mr Setchell said Conaust, a subsidiary of Peninsular and Oriental Steam
Navigation of the UK, hopes an agreement reducing its Sydney workforce by 30
per cent will be implemented next month.
Only one company has so far implemented an agreement under the reform
process, which the government says will reduce the waterfront workforce from
6,500 to 4,500 by September next year.
The ACTU, which voted on Wednesday to campaign for full payment of the
Accord, said the deal showed employers were willing to recognise that the
Commission's 2.5 per cent ceiling was unworkable.
'It is an indication of what is possible if employers are willing to sit
down and talk to us,' said Mr Martin Ferguson, ACTU president.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday called on
African leaders to support democratic principles which he said could provide
an engine for change in developing countries.
Speaking to Senegal's national assembly in Dakar, Mr Delors said further
democratisation was essential if African countries were to meet the economic
challenges ahead.
Mr Delors is on his first visit as commission president to sub-Saharan
Africa.
Commission officials see the four-day trip as an opportunity to reaffirm the
links between the EC and Africa now that the potential for confrontation
between superpowers on the African continent is diminishing. The end of the
Cold War has also allowed leading donors such as the EC to link development
aid more explicitly to democratic and macro-economic improvements.
Like IMF and World Bank aid programmes, the EC's latest five-year Ecu12bn
(Pounds 8.34bn) aid package for African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states
includes structural adjustment funds. That element of the programme, which
began last year, ties donations to economic developments in ACP countries.
But Mr Delors sought to distinguish the EC structural adjustment fund from
IMF and World Bank aid by stressing the human element of what he called the
'new conscience of development'. Economic initiatives such as privatisation
were important, he said, but they should not be pursued at the expense of
public services.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Allied forces double size of 'safe haven' in northern Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Middle East Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER slice of northern Iraq was yesterday put under the control of
allied forces, while in Baghdad Kurdish leaders believed that they had
extracted important political concessions from the regime of President
Saddam Hussein.
The size of the 'safe haven' for Kurdish refugees in the north was more than
doubled by the deployment of US and allied forces. 'They've moved into the
area and are securing it. They will spend the night there,' a US military
spokesman said. There were no reports of resistance by Mr Saddam's troops or
security forces, who were told on Wednesday to withdraw from the new area.
Only local police may stay and they must register in advance with the
allies. The push to a line 18 miles east of the Iraqi frontier town of
Amadiyah more than doubles the size of the original zone carved out by
western troops in Iraq in April. The allied-controlled area is now about 80
miles long and 40 miles deep. Iraq has protested that the foreign troops are
violating its national sovereignty. American, British, Dutch and French
troops took part in the operation yesterday to expand the security zone and
supplies were being ferried into the area.
The move coincided with reports that the Iraqi regime was prepared to
concede the oil city of Kirkuk as well as some of its oil revenues to a
Kurdish autonomous region, western diplomats said. The reported deal, during
negotiations between the Baghdad government and Kurdish leaders, was
reported to the UN secretary-general, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, by Iraq's
UN ambassador, Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari.
One diplomat said the Kurds appeared to have won some important concessions
from Baghdad, though none had been put on paper yet. 'They appear to have
gotten the city of Kirkuk in their region,' he said, and a share of some oil
revenues derived from fields in the Kurdish autonomous region.
Mr Saddam, spurred on by the presence of foreign troops in the north of his
country, forged an agreement in principle with rebel Kurdish leaders last
week to give them more autonomy.
According to Kurdish leaders, the agreement in principle covered
implementation of a March 11, 1970, autonomy pact.
Mr Jabal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, said the
talks included Kirkuk, which is not formally part of the current autonomous
region of Kurdistan.
He also said Iraqi officials had agreed to abolish the ruling Revolutionary
Command Council and hold multi-party elections within six months.
British officials expressed caution over the claim.

FT  03 MAY 91 / US envoy will take up an uncertain special relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Raymond Seitz arrives in London today as US ambassador to Britain, facing
greater uncertainty in transatlantic relations than appears on the surface.
The conventional view in London is that, after a tense period during the
first 15 months of the Bush administration, relations between the US and
Britain have improved considerably. Since last November Mr Bush and Mr John
Major have worked well together, especially during the war in the Gulf.
All this is true - and Britain played its loyal ally card to the full during
the war. But it should not be exaggerated in the way that some anti-European
Conservatives are apt to do in celebrating an alleged return to the 'special
relationship'.
Americans prefer to talk about the Atlantic Alliance.
Valued as Britain is on defence matters, especially non-Nato ones,
Washington views the UK as part of Europe. As Mr Seitz pointed out in his
confirmation hearings last month, Britain has decided that much of its
future lies with Europe, and it faces the challenge of maintaining a strong
alliance with the US while also being 'good Europeans'.
The tilt by the Major government towards the EC occurs at reassessing its
broader relations with Europe.
As assistant secretary for European and Canadian affairs for the past two
years, Mr Seitz is well placed to act as an interlocutor at a time when
transatlantic relations are at their most uncertain since the late 1940s. He
is the first foreign service officer to be US ambassador to Britain, in more
than 200 years. He knows British politics well from his period as deputy
chief of mission in the late 1980s, so his appointment has been widely
welcomed both among State Department officials and in Whitehall and
Westminster.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DOMESTIC and international opposition is growing to a US Treasury proposal
that foreign banks should put all their American activities into separately
capitalised local subsidiaries if they wish to engage in securities and
insurance operations.
This recommendation, in the Treasury's bank reform legislation, has already
been strongly criticised by international banking groups and by Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who argue that it would
unnecessarily increase costs and could deter foreign banks from operating in
the US.
Until the last few days, the chances of such a proposal being approved
looked slim, in view of the desire of Democratic leaders of the House
banking committee for a narrowly-based bill focusing mainly on the
recapitalisation of the fund insuring bank deposits. But following lobbying
by Mr Nicholas Brady, treasury secretary, House Democrats have agreed to
consider the administration's wider-ranging proposals, including those
affecting foreign banks.
Sir Leon Brittan, vice president of the European Commission, this week
warned that the proposals would severely limit the ability of EC banks to
compete effectively in the US market. Foreign banks wishing to engage in
securities activities would have to convert their existing banking
operations from a branch or agency into a separately capitalised subsidiary.
They would have to conduct their activities on the basis of local US capital
rather the worldwide capital, as is now the case.
Mr Greenspan yesterday argued that the US 'sorely' needed to reform its
banking industry, but warned that bankers would 'make a big mistake if they
anticipate that modifications in laws and regulations alone will solve their
problems.'
He argued that to avoid a further credit crunch, bankers needed to raise
their capital ratios and lower their asset risks.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Colombia suspected of soft-pedalling war on drugs: The
public appreciates the respite as the nature of the struggle has changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSHED around in an armour-plated white Mercedes accompanied by six armed
outriders and a back-up jeep full of body-guards, Miss Universe recently
visited Bogota.
The high-spot for the 19-year-old beauty queen from Norway was a meeting
with President Cesar Gaviria. The encounter in the presidential palace was
splashed across the front pages - it was the first time in three years it
was safe for a Miss Universe to come to Colombia.
People walk the streets of Bogota without fear of car bombs planted by the
drug barons. The military presence is less obvious. But to any outsider,
this 'tranquillity' remains relative - Colombians have been progressively
anaesthetised against all save the most appalling atrocity.
There are still, on average, a staggering 22,500 violent deaths a year. The
country's complex, interlocking and often deeply private wars continue in
varying degrees of intensity - the government battles against leftist
guerrillas, the guerrillas against the government, the state against the
drug traffickers, the traffickers against the guerrillas, traffickers
against traffickers. Meanwhile self-defence and paramilitary groups strive
to 'clean up' society.
In Bogota alone, the police collect around 150 unidentified bodies a month,
carrying them off twice a week in an ageing Chevrolet truck for burial in a
common grave.
However, a sense of normality lingers, despite this grim panorama, for two
reasons. Firstly, Colombia's well diversified and cautiously managed economy
continues to grow at 3 per cent without the region's twin traumas of a heavy
debt overhang or high inflation. Unemployment is falling and incomes have
kept abreast of inflation, which over the past decade has oscillated between
16 and 32 per cent annually.
Second, the nature of the confrontation between the state and the drugs
mafia has changed. Since President Gaviria took office last August the
all-out war declared by his predecessor, Mr Virgilio Barco, has become a
low-intensity conflict with both sides putting out peace-feelers.
The public undoubtedly appreciates the respite. But the president's
detractors claim he is moving dangerously close to a policy of appeasement.
Colombians and foreigners directly involved in fighting the
multi-billion-dollar narcotics business say the progress in dismantling the
influence and infrastructure of the drugs cartels achieved under Mr Barco is
being undermined.
Cocaine production, US narcotics agents say, is still over 500 tons a year -
similar to or above the levels before Mr Barco declared his all-out war on
the traffickers in August 1989.
The president is aware of these criticisms; but associates say they come
from those who see Colombia's drugs problem primarily in policing terms.
They insist Mr Gaviria's policy is consistent with his electoral pledge to
break the spiral of violence by reforming Colombia's justice system and
creating a distinction between drug-trafficking and drugs-inspired terrorism
 -the former being an economic and social problem, the latter a police and
judicial one.
But at the same time the government believes it is impossible to sustain a
high-intensity war against the drug cartels at great economic cost and
social strain when the drug-consuming countries are making so little headway
in curbing demand.
Mr Gaviria is thus walking a tight-rope between preserving the state's
authority and placating a mafia which society lacks the will to combat. For
instance, the powerful Medelln cartel, which controls most cocaine
production and sales, has the blood of thousands on its hands. Even so,
three decrees were passed between September and December, each more lenient
than the last, encouraging the traffickers to turn themselves in.
Three brothers from the Ochoa family, one of the principal Medelln cartel
groups, have taken advantage of the decrees and are now in custody. They are
widely expected to receive light sentences in what one lawyer called
'five-star prisons from which they can continue their business'.
The traffickers' principal demand has been the abrogation of the treaty of
extradition with the US. They have violently opposed the idea of extradition
for more than six years because they know the Colombian justice system can
be intimidated or bought.
The US Drug Enforcement Agency has pleaded with the constituent assembly not
to overturn the extradition provisions. However, nationalist sentiment has
made extradition unpopular anyway, and it would be surprising if the treaty
were not revoked. This would inevitably be seen by Washington as a
down-grading of Colombia's anti-drug effort and could well produce a severe
strain in relations.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Bush rejects Gulf war book 'nit-picking'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday attacked a book that claims General Colin
Powell counselled him against going to war against Iraq, saying it contained
made-up quotes and inaccuracies, Peter Riddell writes.
'They are not going to divide (Gen Powell and me),' Mr Bush said in response
to questions about the book by Bob Woodward of the Washington Post, The
Commanders, which alleges that Gen Powell, chairman of the US joint chiefs
of staff, had serious reservations about the Bush administration's shift
last October towards an offensive military strategy against Iraq and
favoured a policy of long-term containment through economic and military
pressures.
Mr Bush said he had not read the book, but some of the incidents described
in it were not true. He called it a 'little nit-picking analysis after the
fact.' 'I called (Gen Powell) up today and I said, 'If you have any angst,
forget about it.' He said, 'I don't',' Mr Bush said.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said of the Woodward book:
'We're not going to get involved in second-guessing or reviewing the
decision-making process here. It went well. We won the war. People are going
to write books, people are going to talk to them. We've got the mother of
all spin here in 800 pages. We'll probably get more of them.'
The White House is determined to maintain Mr Bush's image as a successful
war leader and commander-in-chief ahead of next year's presidential
re-election campaign.
Mr Woodward says Gen Powell was concerned both about Mr Bush's decision,
without consultation, to state in early August that the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait 'will not stand', and his move in November to order a doubling of US
troops in the region.
The Washington Post said yesterday the book portrays Mr Bush and his senior
advisers as secretive, sometimes indecisive, occasionally impulsive and
often at odds with each other.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Arms to Iraq: A fatal attraction - Under the nose of the
White House, kickbacks and illegal deals funded Saddam

A joint investigation by the Financial Times and ABC News/Nightline has
uncovered fresh evidence that the Bush administration's indulgent attitude
towards Iraq made it easy for Baghdad to fund its illegal arms network
virtually unhindered in the run-up to the invasion of Kuwait. Lionel Barber
and Alan Friedman report from Washington
SIX WEEKS ago a Jordanian middleman received an order from Baghdad for a
sophisticated type of hot rolled steel. According to copies of the order,
the purchaser specified dimensions of 115mm x 115mm, the kind used in the
manufacture of heavy industrial equipment. It is also the kind used in the
manufacture of long-barrelled artillery guns.
The order, placed in March 1991, came from Chaled Makhzoumi, working through
the Iraqi commercial centre in Amman, Jordan.
Traffic along the dusty road from Amman to Baghdad, one of the main conduits
in the past for the transhipment of arms to Iraq, is beginning to build up
again.
To defence intelligence officials in Washington this suggests one thing:
President Saddam Hussein is still in the business of building up his
considerable arsenal.
According to US intelligence sources and Iraqi opposition leaders the Iraqi
leader dispatched agents across the border into Jordan - under the direction
from Baghdad of his son Uday - in search of spare parts for his remaining
tanks, machine guns and artillery, just weeks after his costly expulsion
from Kuwait by the US-led coalition.
The revival of the Jordan connection, in violation of the United Nations
embargo against Iraq, is a reminder of how resourceful and determined
President Saddam had been in building up hundreds of millions of dollars of
western technology and weaponry, his aggressive use of which led the US to
send more than 500,000 troops to deal with the consequences.
A retired senior US diplomat with extensive experience in the Middle East
says the world 'has never seen anything as sophisticated as the Iraqi
procurement network' - a web of front companies, purchasing agents and money
laundering specialists who operated through more than 50 undercover outlets
in Europe and the US.
Their collective mission throughout the 1980s, as Iraq exploited the west's
(and in particular Washington's) fear of Islamic fundamentalism in Iran, was
this: to help Saddam Hussein build the weapons of mass destruction needed to
attain his goal of military supremacy in the Gulf.
Starved of commercial credit by the middle of 1989 because of Baghdad's huge
and growing volume of unserviceable debt, the Iraqi agents' chief source of
finance was an obscure Italian-owned bank branch in Atlanta, Georgia.
The parent bank's name was Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. BNL may be Italy's
biggest bank with Dollars 100bn (Pounds 59bn) of assets but the Atlanta
branch from which this extraordinary supply effort was largely funded had
just 16 employees and authorisation to lend no more than Dollars 500,000
without approval from its head office in Rome.
Between 1987 and 1989, BNL Atlanta - now the subject of criminal proceedings
and congressional investigations - made Dollars 3bn of Iraqi loan
commitments.
These loans were kept off the official books and were used to supply not
only legitimate exporters to Iraq but also some of the Iraqi front companies
and procurement agents that were covertly channelling equipment ordered by
Baghdad for Mr Saddam's nuclear, chemical and ballistic missile projects.
A joint investigation by the Financial Times and ABC News/Nightline, has
uncovered fresh evidence showing that the Bush administration's indulgent
attitude towards Iraq in effect allowed the arms network to operated
virtually unhindered.
The FT/ABC investigation has also discovered that, on the financial front,
the Bush administration treated Iraq with remarkable leniency, brushing
aside evidence of abuse by US companies and by Baghdad of
government-guaranteed Iraqi farm credits.
Among the abuses were 'kickbacks' or 'extras' such as the supply of armoured
vehicles to Iraqi officials supplementing the legitimate grain shipments.
The first warnings about the Iraqi loan programme appeared in 1987 when US
grain companies complained to the US Agriculture Department (USDA) about
Iraqi demands for tyres, air-conditioning equipment, spare parts, trucks and
even cash - so-called 'after-sales services'.
Yet in November 1989, the White House pressed successfully for approval of
Dollars 1bn of fresh guaranteed loans requested by the Department of
Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC).
Then, in January 1990, President Bush declared it to be in the national
interest to allow the US Export-Import Bank to guarantee further loans,
despite government studies showing that Iraq was no longer creditworthy.
There were also widespread concerns at the time among US Customs officials
and Treasury, Federal Reserve and Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
officials that some of the US government loans ostensibly for agricultural
commodities were, in fact, diverted by Iraq's Ministry of Industry and
Military Industrialisation for the purchase of military goods.
In the light of Mr Saddam's increasingly brutal and unpredictable behaviour
and the subsequent invasion of Kuwait the administration's actions raise
questions about its judgment and the advice it was receiving.
Some of the answers to these questions may lie in a key White House meeting
held on November 8 1989 under the aegis of the National Advisory Council
(NAC), a sub-cabinet-level group that reviews government-guaranteed foreign
loans that raise political issues.
The meeting was called to resolve an inter-agency dispute over an
Agriculture Department proposal to offer Dollars 1bn of fresh CCC Iraqi loan
guarantees. As one senior official admitted this week, there were 'enough
yellow flags (signals of foul play) to make us worry about BNL'.
Several features of the meeting were unusual:
A number of agencies were represented at a high level. It was also attended
by a White House representative, which underscored the high political stakes
involved.
The meeting's minutes were deemed sensitive enough to be classified, the
first time this has occurred since the late 1970s, according to a US
government lawyer.
A month earlier, a Federal Reserve official had told a previous NAC meeting
that Iraq's use of the CCC programme amounted to a 'Ponzi scheme' - an
American term which means that Iraq would default on its CCC loans unless it
continued to receive ever-larger CCC allocations. The Fed official also said
that Iraq was 'probably not creditworthy'.
One participant at the White House meeting recalled that the BNL Atlanta
scam was uppermost in the minds of several officials. 'We had a lot on BNL.
We knew the thing was stinking. I think we all understood this was not a
happy situation,' he said.
Another participant said he tabled numerous concerns about the abuse of the
CCC programme, Iraq's creditworthiness and the BNL affair.
According to a number of documents, including reports from the meeting, and
interviews with a number of officials, the meeting was told by Mr John
Robson, deputy Treasury secretary, that it was important to ensure that the
final decision on the Dollars 1bn guarantee would 'pass the sniff test for
hostile congressional committees and press'.
Mr Robert Kimmitt, under-secretary of state, followed up by declaring that
Iraq was 'very important to US interests in the Middle East'; it was
'influential in the peace process' and was 'a key to maintaining stability
in the region, offering great trade opportunities for US companies'.
Mr Kimmitt added that abruptly terminating the Dollars 1bn in guarantees for
Iraq was 'contrary to the president's intentions' and would most likely
further damage US-Iraqi relations.
This assessment seemed all the more curious since just a few weeks before
that meeting, the State Department had told the Federal Reserve Bank of
Atlanta, the regulatory bank probing the BNL affair, that, far from being a
'rogue operation', BNL-Atlanta was in effect part of official Iraqi policy.
According to a September 1989 Italian intelligence report to Prime Minister
Giulio Andreotti, and the findings of US investigators, unauthorised BNL
funds were being used to finance Iraq's Condor II missile project - despite
efforts by the US, Britain and five other countries to halt the spread of
missile technology in the developing world.
All this was serious enough to warrant Mr James Baker, US secretary of
state, raising the matter with a senior Iraqi official, believed to be Mr
Tariq Aziz, Iraq's foreign minister, at their meeting in Washington on
October 6 1989 - the Bush administration's first high-level meeting with
Iraq.
At the NAC meeting a month later, Mr Kimmitt nevertheless came out in favour
of continuing the CCC programme as a political tool for influencing Iraqi
behaviour - and he had the backing of the Department of Agriculture, which
appeared to be pursuing its own, narrower interests.
Seven days before the meeting, a senior Agriculture Department official
wrote a letter to the Treasury in which he dismissed allegations about the
BNL affair and said the charges 'lead us to conclude that there is not
sufficient reason to delay a program for Iraq any longer'.
Mr Kimmitt's intervention appeared decisive, since Mr Robson summed up that
foreign policy and trade considerations overrode 'concerns raised by the BNL
scandal'.
There were other disturbing signs about the extent of knowledge in the
administration and the banking system about BNL's activities:
BNL Atlanta regularly had Dollars 700m to Dollars 1bn outstanding in
short-term credits at JP Morgan, a large amount for a small bank even
considering the fact that its parent in Rome was a triple-A rated bank. Most
of BNL's funds after 1987 were channelled through Morgan Guaranty Trust in
New York.
The New York Federal Reserve was later to raise questions with JP Morgan
about the ease with which the funds transfer took place. In August 1989 Mr
Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed, told Mr Lewis Preston,
chairman of Morgan Guaranty, that the operation involved amounts of money
which started at 'fairly modest levels' and over a fairly lengthy period
built up to 'a pretty goddamn good size'.
Mr Corrigan noted that the unusual flow of funds through BNL Atlanta
stretched back for more than two years and expressed surprise that the flow
had occurred with such ease - given the sums involved and the single
destination.
Both Morgan and the New York Fed declined to be interviewed about the Morgan
link. Morgan has maintained that the sheer volume of funds in its clearing
system in the US makes it difficult to detect anything suspicious about
BNL-type transfers. Morgan clears Dollars 250bn a day.
The FBI-led raid on BNL's Atlanta branch took place on August 4 1989 - but
the Federal Reserve inspectors had already compiled a detailed picture of
hundreds of millions of dollars of hidden off-book money market transactions
in which BNL Atlanta used brokers to borrow interbank funds from big Wall
Street and international banks.
These included National Westminster, Mitsui Trust and Banque Nationale de
Paris (BNP). Records show that these were some of the funds BNL Atlanta then
passed to Baghdad by way of Morgan in New York. Between 1987 and 1989,
several thousand telexes criss-crossed between Atlanta and the Iraqi central
bank, the state-owned Rafidain Bank, Iraq's Ministry of Industry and
Military Industrialisation and other official Iraqi agencies.
Congressional investigators and US officials maintain that the National
Security Agency (NSA), the US code-breaking and surveillance service which
can track telex traffic and money flows, ought to have picked up the
tell-tale sums of money.
Mr Norm Bailey, a White House aide at the time who started a
follow-the-money computer programme that used NSA intercepts, says it is
inconceivable that the BNL Atlanta-Baghdad telex traffic was not made
available to the administration.
'The only explanation I can think of is that the authorities knew all about
it and approved it,' he claimed in an interview. 'They were using this as a
channel for the financing of certain activities.'
This is a serious allegation that raises questions about whether the
administration sanctioned the bank transfers in pursuit of a foreign policy
goal. However, both federal regulatory authorities and US officials deny
knowledge of what was going on in Atlanta.
Whatever the case, the funds proved crucial to President Saddam's war effort
for a while.
'BNL,' says Mr Achmed Chalabi, a prominent Jordanian banker and Iraqi
opposition adviser, 'became Iraq's surrogate lender of last resort.'
Many BNL-backed US companies were supplying equipment such as electronics,
special metals, chemicals and machinery which could be defended as destined
for civil rather than military projects. The same was true of BNL-funded
British, French, and German companies, all of which were crowding into the
Iraqi market.
It is true that the Soviet Union was by far the largest supplier to
gnificant about the western shipments was that they involved high technology
and other materials which Baghdad required to accelerate its unconventional
weapons and missile programmes.
In the UK, the best-known member of the Iraqi network was Matrix Churchill,
a loss-making Coventry machine tools maker whose fortunes were revived
through BNL finance. Matrix (which was later bought by Automation
Investments) regularly shipped equipment to Iraq; its Ohio sister, Matrix
Churchill Inc, was recently seized by US Customs and held up as an example
of an Iraqi front company engaged in illicit military procurement
activities.
It was only after the end of the Gulf war last February that Mr Richard
Thornburgh, US attorney-general, announced the indictments of BNL Atlanta
employees and four top Iraqi government officials on charges of money
laundering, fraud and conspiracy.
Two lone Democratic congressmen - Mr Henry Gonzalez, a stubborn,
unpredictable Texan who heads the House banking committee, and Mr Charlie
Rose, a North Carolina specialist in peanuts, tobacco and Tibetan human
rights - have grappled with its complexities.
They alone have challenged the Bush administration's adamant claim that it
was unaware of what was going on inside the BNL's Atlanta branch.
Yet even if one assumes that BNL's activities were carried out without the
knowledge of the US government, questions remain about the White House's
persistent flirtation with Mr Saddam at the time.
'Iraq was a natural ally of moderate Arab states; it was allied with Egypt;
it was being constructive in the Middle East peace process,' says Mr Peter
Rodman, who served in the Reagan and Bush administrations as a senior
National Security Council official. 'The fact that Saddam was a murderous
thug did not change this.'
The Iran-Contra scandal, which paralysed the Reagan administration for most
of 1987, had two big results: official overtures to Iran, whether public or
private, became taboo; this pushed Washington further toward favouring
Baghdad.
Even after the unauthorised BNL credit pipeline was exposed and shut off, Mr
Bush signed the January 1990 order allowing Eximbank to offer fresh
guarantees to Iraqi loans. Intended or not, the Eximbank decision helped to
plug part of the gap left by the absence of BNL money.
It all appeared to make little impression on Mr Saddam, however. Mr Bush was
rewarded with a searing burst of anti-Americanism by the Iraqi leader in
front of the Arab Co-operation Council on February 22.
At that same meeting, Mr Saddam issued an ominous warning in front of
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, King Hussein of Jordan and President Ali
Abdullah Saleh of Yemen. The Iraqi leader wanted Dollars 30bn he had been
lent by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait during the war with Iran to be written off
and a further Dollars 30bn put on the table. According to officials present,
the Iraqi leader astonished his colleagues by saying he would 'know how to
go and get the money' if it was not forthcoming.
On March 28 a 'sting' operation by British customs ended with the seizure of
a number of US-made electronic 'Krytrons' which could have been used as
detonators for nuclear weapons. Again, a BNL-funded company - Euromac -
played a role in the nuclear trigger case. Days later - on April 2 -
President Saddam threatened to ' scorch' Israel with chemical weapons.
Yet the US administration's accommodation of Iraq continued into the
following months. In April, May and June 1990, three high-level inter-agency
group meetings at the White House rejected the idea of introducing economic
sanctions against Baghdad.
As late as last July, just one week before the invasion, US officials both
in Washington and in Baghdad were still seeking to find ways of persuading
him to play the moderate role he had long since discarded.
This culminated in the now infamous meeting between Ms April Glaspie, then
US ambassador to Baghdad, and Mr Saddam in which the American diplomat
failed, according to congressional critics, to warn the Iraqi leader in
sufficiently strong terms to keep his hands off Kuwait.
Ms Glaspie has served as a convenient scapegoat for the Bush administration.
But a fairer interpretation of events would place that meeting in the
broader context of US dealings with Iraq - a pattern which suggests either
misguided indulgence or a calculated effort to bolster Mr Saddam.

THE Bush Administration pushed through a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 568m) loan
guarantee to Iraq for farm exports just 10 months before the invasion of
Kuwait despite being presented with reports of widespread abuse of US funds
by Baghdad at the time.
The White House repeatedly dismissed objections by senior officials to its
policy of using government-guaranteed credit as a means of maintaining good
relations with Baghdad over this period.
Baghdad's reported abuse of funds included: The use of some US government
farm credits to procure militarily-useful purchases.
Growing evidence that it was manipulating the US banking system illegally to
fund its arms programme.
Suggestions that it was demanding 'kickbacks', including armoured trucks, as
part of the credit scheme.
The debate over the issue came to a climax at a White House meeting on
November 8, 1989 when senior officials from the Federal Reserve, US Treasury
and Commerce Department all objected to the Dollars 1bn guarantee to back US
farm exports to Iraq. The reasons cited, according to participants at the
meeting, included the view that Iraq was no longer creditworthy - it was
then in default on its Dollars 65bn of foreign debt - and that Baghdad had
already admitted to the US that it had abused the same loan guarantee
scheme.
Opponents of the guarantee were also concerned at the political and
financial fall-out from scandal surrounding the Atlanta, Georgia branch of
Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). The branch had extended Dollars
3bn of unauthorised Iraqi loans used to finance Baghdad's weapons
development programme. It is now the subject of congressional and criminal
investigations.
Mr Robert Kimmitt, the under-secretary of state, told the White House
meeting that abruptly terminating the Dollars 1bn of loan guarantees for
Iraq would be 'contrary to the president's intentions'. These were most
effective way to improve relations with Iraq was through increased trade.
The White House meeting approved the Dollars 1bn guaranteed agricultural
credit, ignoring an Iraqi government admission to the US just weeks before
that it had received what US officials described as kickbacks such as
armoured trucks in connection with the same US government credit scheme.
The abuse of the guaranteed food credit scheme - which is extended through
the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) of the US Department of Agriculture
(USDA) - was confirmed by participants at the White House meeting and by
documents obtained as part of a joint investigation by the Financial Times
and ABC News/Nightline.
The documents show that at a US-Iraqi bilateral meeting in Washington on
October 5, 1989 Iraq 'admitted that it routinely received what it
euphemistically called 'after sale service' such as armoured trucks from US
commodity suppliers'. They go on to say this service 'might be construed as
kickbacks which the USDA warned Iraq in 1988 were in violation in the CCC
programme'.
USDA has played down the size of the kickbacks and said evidence of abuse
was inconclusive in late 1989.
Half the dollars 1bn was dispersed to Baghdad. However, when Iraq's abuse of
the CCC loan scheme was officially confirmed in a government report that was
made public in April 1990 the remaining half was halted.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Conservatives lose seats across country
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVES lost seats steadily across the country in yesterday's
municipal elections while Labour captured a number of key councils, write
Richard Evans and Neil Buckley.
Labour's performance varied in different parts of the country, with the most
impressive results coming in the north-west and in parts of the Tory
heartland in the south, but with a weaker showing through most of the
Midlands. The Liberal Democrats did much better than forecast, scoring
particularly well in some councils they had specifically targeted, but they
also scored some unexpected victories in unlikely areas such as Durham and
Wear Valley in the north-east.
It was a mixed pattern that showed the Conservatives, seeking to hold the
seats they won in 1987, very much on the defensive, while both the
opposition parties made significant but not overwhelming inroads.
The worrying news for the government was the number of councils lost in the
south, where the Conservatives had hoped to retain most of their seats and
virtually all the councils where they had gone into the election holding
majorities.
In the event, they lost overall control in Canterbury, St Albans,
Winchester, Brentwood, Northampton, Stratford on Avon, Dover and Reigate and
Banstead to a combination of Labour, Liberal Democrat and Independent
opponents.
The Tories also lost overall control at Solihull in the Midlands, one of
only two metropolitan authorities that was still in Conservative hands.
Labour scored significant victories at Darlington, taking the council with a
swing of more than 6 per cent, and at Luton and Nottingham. Among councils
captured in the north west were Wirral, Blackpool and Pendle in an area
containing many Tory Parliamentary marginal seats.
There was also good news for Labour in Cardiff, where they took the council
with a swing of 8 per cent, and in Plymouth where they won overall control,
taking seats from both the Tories and Liberal Democrats.
However, there was less welcome news from Liverpool, with left-wing Labour
rebels standing against their party's official candidates taking five out of
the six seats contested. Labour also lost overall control in Barrow in
Furness, Chorley and Basildon.
The impressive Liberal Democrat gains came at Eastbourne, where the party
won a Parliamentary by-election last year, Torbay, Gosport, Congleton, and
Oadby.
In addition, however, the party took Lewes from the Tories in the south and
Wear Valley from Labour in the north east. A big blow for the Tories was the
loss of overall control in Derby, but they gained Boothferry on Humberside
from Labour.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Labour well ahead in polls: Local council results snuff out
chance of general election in June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY Conservative losses to both Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the
local elections yesterday finally closed Mr John Major's option of a June
general election.
The results, however, were disappointing rather than devastating for the
Conservatives and left wide open the eventual result of the parliamentary
election which the prime minister must call by July 1992.
The view among senior ministers is that an autumn election is still a
distinct possibility, although Mr Major will want to keep open the
possibility of next spring.
With about half of the results announced by the early hours of this morning,
Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaign manager, claimed a sweeping victory.
He declared that his party was firmly on course to win the general election.
As Labour registered particularly strong gains in many areas in the south,
Mr Cunningham said: 'The Tories will not win an election now, but our
country desperately needs one'.
In some local authorities, such as Plymouth, Labour recorded swings against
the Conservatives of more than 10 per cent. But there were wide variations
from council to council and the average swing across the country appeared to
be 5 or 6 per cent.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, was equally upbeat about his
party's prospects as it gained scores of seats and captured several
councils, confounding forecasts that it would suffer heavy losses.
Against that, Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative Party chairman, voiced his
confidence that a sharp fall in inflation and an upturn in economic growth
over the next few months would restore his party's fortunes by the autumn.
Labour's share of the national vote in the 12,000 seats outside Scotland and
London contested yesterday appeared to stand two or three to the
Conservatives. Both parties looked likely to emerge fairly close to their
present opinion poll standings of just below 40 per cent.
But a Labour analysis of the voting in 31 marginal seats put it 5 points
ahead with 43 per cent against the Conservatives' 38 per cent.
In spite of the prospect of losses running into several hundred council
seats, Mr Patten said it was clear the government had recovered
significantly from its low-point last year.
He acknowledged implicitly, however, that a June general election was now an
impossibility, commenting that his party was in the process of climbing a
'very big hill'. Mr Patten shares the view of his colleagues that the autumn
is now the earliest possible general election date.
Projections based on the declared results suggested that overall the
Conservatives would lose about 400 council seats to both Labour and the
Liberal Democrats. By the early hours of this morning, Labour had won
control of a number of key councils including Cardiff, Nottingham, and
Darlington. For their part, the Liberal Democrats' strong performance gave
them control of Eastbourne, Lewes and Gosport in Hampshire.
Overall the apparent 5 per cent swing in favour of Labour marked a dramatic
reversal of the results in May 1987 when the same seats were last fought. It
would not be enough, however, to give Mr Neil Kinnock outright victory at a
general election.
In 1987, the Conservatives won 40 per cent of the vote against the 31 per
cent secured by Labour and the 27 per cent which went to the then
Liberal/SDP Alliance. The outcome prompted Mrs Margaret Thatcher to call a
general election the following month.
Mr Patten will be spending this weekend with friends in Yorkshire rather
than following the example of his predecessors in 1983 and 1987 by
travelling to see the prime minister at his Chequers country residence.
Mr Michael Heseltine, whose announcement late in the campaign of the
Conservatives' plan to replace the poll tax with a property-based 'council
tax' failed to restore his party's popularity, echoed Mr Patten in
suggesting that the prime minister would wait until inflation had fallen
decisively before seeking a fresh mandate.
Among the Conservatives' council losses were Brentwood in Essex and Reigate
and Banstead in Surrey. They also lost control of Derby.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Lloyd's launches reforms in bid to reassure Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REFORMS designed to defuse tension at Lloyd's of London were announced
yesterday by the insurance market's authorities.
The changes aim to give more information to the 26,500 Names who back
underwriting with their personal wealth and to prevent disputes going to
court.
The measures come as the market faces the prospect of at least two years of
overall losses and as an increasing number of Names are resorting to the
courts to avert bankruptcy.
Mr Alan Lord, the Lloyd's chief executive, said the 'overall purpose of the
package is to reassure Names and ensure that the consequences of losses are
dealt with within the family of Lloyd's rather than in a public forum.'
Names should benefit from three separate measures:
A procedure to review 'major' insurance losses by any of the market's 354
syndicates is to be introduced next month.
Where a syndicate's net loss at the end of the market's three-year
accounting period amounts to 150 per cent or more of the syndicate's
allocated capacity - the amount of premium it is permitted to write
according to market regulations - the governing body of Lloyd's will review
the 'commercial circumstances' of the loss.
Committees, possibly comprising former Lloyd's underwriters and chaired by
an independent outsider, will conduct the reviews. Mr Lord said the reviews
would not be published but they would generally be made available to Names
via their members' agents.
Mr Lord insisted that the reviews would be 'quite distinct' from
investigations relating to matters of potential misconduct.
The investigation 'is not designed to point the finger at anyone', he said.
Conciliation and arbitration procedures will be revised in an attempt to
resolve disputes between members of Lloyd's and their agents before they go
to court. 'Before litigation there is a role for conciliation,' Mr Lord
said.
A conciliation scheme for settling disputes between Names and their agents
will be developed, while arbitration procedures, established in 1987, will
be streamlined to reduce delays.
Syndicates are to be obliged to disclose the salaries paid to underwriters
in published annual reports from 1990.
This follows criticism that the rise in Lloyd's underwriters' salaries - who
can expect to earn Pounds 75,000-Pounds 300,000 a year - has depressed
syndicates' profitability.

FT  03 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK INDEX futures were unable to provide much of a lead yesterday and
instead followed the tone set by the cash market and Wall Street.
Some brokers believed the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the UK
local elections left dealers unable to call the next move in share prices
with any degree of confidence.
The futures market had begun weakly on aggressive selling by locals and at
one stage the June FT-SE 100 index contract had narrowed to a premium of
just 18-20 points to the spot index, against 30 at the previous close.
Institutional buying then pushed the market higher and June's premium
widened to almost 30 points. However, the futures' gains had little effect
on the stock market, which continued to track Wall Street off its highs.
The June FT-SE closed at 2,552, up 26 on the day and 22 above the spot
index. With fair value calculated at 15 points, the futures market is still
expecting a rise in the London stock market.
Turnover in traded options was lifted as James Capel hedged against the
FT-SE index rising above 2,825 by the year-end. The deal involved the
purchase of 250 December 2,525 Euro FT-SE 100 index calls, and the sale of
the same amount of December 2,625 and 2,725 calls.

BARCLAYS has appointed its first two non-British directors. They are Mr
Shijuro Ogata of Japan and Mr Jan Peelen of the Netherlands, writes David
Lascelles, Banking Editor.
Mr Ogata was deputy governor for international relations at the Bank of
Japan and subsequently deputy governor of the Japan Development Bank, from
which he retired earlier this year. Mr Peelen is a director of Unilever with
responsibility for the East Asian and Pacific region.
Sir John Quinton, Barclays' chairman, said the appointments would be of
value to Barclays as an international corporate and investment bank, and he
hoped eventually to appoint a director from the US as well.
Mr Ogata said he hoped his appointment would lead to greater international
understanding on banking issues at a time when global banking markets were
becoming increasingly integrated.

FT  03 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rates disappointment
leaves Nikkei easier
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo
SHARE PRICES were mixed on position-squaring ahead of the long weekend and
on disappointment that the Bank of Japan did not follow the US lead in
cutting interest rates, writes Seth Sulkin in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 11.14 to 26,477.86, after an early high of 26,648.58
on New York's gains and a low of 26,414.44 later in the afternoon. Many
large-capital issues were weak, while small and medium-sized companies were
popular with investors looking for strong earnings potential.
The Topix index of all first section issues gained 3.04 to 2,001.49, while
the second section rose 33.66 to 3,374.63. Volume improved to 380m shares
from 350m. Rises led declines by 608 to 348, with 161 stocks unchanged. In
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.54 to 1,509.34.
Expectations of lower interest rates faded following comments yesterday
morning by Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, finance minister, that an easing in
monetary policy was not necessary at the moment. Dealers said the market
still hoped, however, that the Bank of Japan would reduce the discount rate
after the Golden Week holidays. Financial markets will be closed today and
on Monday.
Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said investors were
focusing more on earnings and dividend growth potential than on capital
gains. Lower-priced shares were also sought, which explained the strong
rises on the second section and the over-the-counter market.
Big-capital companies, such as steels and utilities, eased. Some financials
were stronger on persistent hopes of lower interest rates. Sumitomo Bank,
Industrial Bank of Japan and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank each rose Y40, to Y2,410,
Y3,910 and Y2,430 respectively.
Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical fell Y50 to Y2,930 on announcing a smaller than
expected 3 per cent increase in pre-tax recurring profits for the year ended
March 31. The company also forecast only a 2 per cent gain in earnings
growth for the current fiscal year. The pharmaceutical sector in general
retreated on fears of other companies reporting poor results.
Toyama Chemical shed Y10 to Y785 on stating it expects to lose Y2.5bn in the
six-month period to end-May and lowering its revenue projections. The
company's 30 per cent stake in a now bankrupt affiliated concern has hurt
earnings and investor perceptions.
Nippon Densetsu Kogyo established another record high, closing up Y60 at
Y1,970 on continued speculation of increased investment in the rail
industry.
In Osaka, the OSE average finished at 29,412.16, up 266.76, on volume of 32m
shares.
Roundup
THE Pacific Rim was mixed: Hong Kong was in optimistic mood but Australia
was worried by the prospects for Adelaide Steamship.
HONG KONG climbed 2.6 per cent in response to the overnight Wall Street
advance, hopes of interest rate cuts and expectations of a breakthrough in
the airport talks. The Hang Seng index added 94.91 at 3,726.14 in turnover
similar to Wednesday's at HKDollars 1.72bn.
AUSTRALIA was unnerved by the suspension of Adsteam and two of its
associates, after the group abandoned its restructuring plans. The market
was also depressed by institutional selling ahead of forthcoming rights
issues.
The All Ordinaries index fell 12.6 to 1,519.9 in turnover of ADollars 197m,
down from ADollars 208m. The three leading listed banks exposed to Adsteam
declined: NAB lost 14 cents to ADollars 6.14, Westpac 8 cents to ADollars
4.53 and ANZ 4 cents to ADollars 3.83.
NEW ZEALAND firmed on lower interest rates. The Barclays index put on 15.49
to 1,491.55 in turnover of NZDollars 19.6m, against NZDollars 24.7m.
Fletcher Challenge stood out with a rise of 6 cents to NZDollars 4.03 on
volume of 2.2m.
SEOUL rose on speculation that the government would support troubled
investment trust companies. The composite index gained 7.88 to 652.27 in
trading worth Won341bn.
TAIWAN's weighted index declined 73.11 or 1.2 per cent to 5,777.07. Volume
shrank to TDollars 59bn from TDollars 92bn.

FT  03 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets: Eastern Europe learns the symbolic
value of bourses - The progress towards capitalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINICK COYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'In many communist countries, stock exchanges rank with McDonald's as icons
of capitalism. Establishment of a stock exchange, therefore, has symbolic
value and may lend credibility to government efforts towards economic
reform.'
Match that assertion with stretched limousines awaiting customers at Warsaw
airport and academic critiques on the Polish Road to Capitalism, and you can
get something of the feel of what is happening in eastern Europe, or at the
very least of what some (mainly western-based) entrepreneurs hope will
happen in the developing capital markets of the former communist countries.
The McDonald's analogy comes from a young, engaging and bright Italian
lawyer who took up residence a few weeks ago in Prague, 'because I like the
city'; presumably his bosses at the World Bank, in Washington, approved of
the location, not least because of its political sensitivity.
Mr Cesare Calari, a product of Bologna's Law School, picked up his
near-perfect English at the John Hopkins university in the US, won a
placement under the World Bank's Young Professionals Programme, and went to
work for the bank's affiliate, the International Finance Corporation (IFC).
Moving by way of responsibility and concern for central America, east Asia
and southern Africa, he is back not too far from his native Italy, in the
Czech capital of Prague. His job: the IFC's regional representative in
eastern Europe, capital markets division.
If stock markets take off in eastern Europe, some of the credit should go to
Mr Calari and his IFC colleagues. They are now laying the groundwork for the
emergence of capital markets in the former communist countries of the east,
designing the essential nuts and bolts for a lot of new capitalist
McDonald's, from Poland to Hungary, Yugoslavia to Czechoslovakia and Romania
and, in between, to Warsaw, Belgrade, Zegrab, Ljubjana and (a delicate task
from Prague) Bratislava, the Slovak capital.
'The current transition to market economies in eastern Europe is a task
whose scale, scope and complexity have few precedents in economic history,'
says Mr Calari.
'In addition, considerable emphasis has been placed on the development of
capital markets and their tangible expression: the stock exchanges. These
institutions must play a key role in the privatisation of state-owned
enterprises by providing liquidity for their shares.'
The task would be a formidable one, even on a clear playing field. But the
field is by no means clear; it risks getting overcrowded with players, not
always on the same side. Everyone wants to help eastern Europe along the
road to developed capital markets, but the motivation ranges from
exploitation to enlightened self-interest, from greed to genuine offers of
help.
The players include second and third-level financial intermediaries - many
out for a fast buck - as well as the World Bank and IFC, the International
Monetary Fund and Mr Jacques Attali's creation, the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
Then there is the Federation of Stock Exchanges in the European Community,
and its component parts; the French are helping the Poles to see the
capitalist light, while the Germans are giving a hand to the Czechs and
Hungarians. The Poles are also talking to the British and the Canadians, and
no one appears to be co-ordinating anything.
At a recent London conference on European Securities Markets in the 1990s,
Mr Calari agreed that there was a risk of confusion, conflicting advice,
exploitation and overkill, but was too modest to say whether the IFC was
best placed to take the lead role.
The work to be done is enormous. The political commitment appears to be
there, although varying from country to country, but there is not much else.
For all practical purposes, none of the east European countries has the
regulatory and legal framework necessary for the efficient conduct of
securities business, an essential assurance for western investors.
The concept of the joint stock company hardly exists, and there is an
appalling minefield (witness what is happening in the former East Germany)
over property rights and ownership.
Audited accounts do not exist; there is little or no corporate information
available for analysis; the business press is under-developed or scarred by
too many years of communist rule; there are infrastructural problems, even
down to market basics such as telephones and photocopying machines, to say
nothing of trading screens and computers, and there is little hard currency
with which to buy them.
Everyone is offering to help, and hoping to gain. But there is hard work to
be done, not just in establishing capital markets but also in educating
potential investors. No one should expect quick results.

FT  03 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Financial sector draws
inspiration from US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTINENT re-opened after Wednesday's May Day holiday in a positive mood
yesterday. Financial stocks were inspired by the US interest rate cut and
Wall Street's strength, writes Our Markets Staff. Madrid remained shut.
PARIS bounced 2.5 per cent higher, after the interest rate cuts in the US
and a rise in the Matif. The CAC 40 index gained 45.05 to 1,824.23 in fairly
good turnover of about FFr2.5bn, up from FFr1.9bn.
One dealer said that the rally was stronger than expected, suggesting that
the index could test the 1,850 level again in the near term, although
failure to break that resistance level could lead to another modest setback.
The financial sector was strong: Bancaire picked up FFr34 or 6.8 per cent to
FFr534, Societe Generale rose FFr25.40 or 6.1 per cent to FFr441.50 and Axa
Midi gained FFr53 or 5.1 per cent to FFr1,090. Suez added FFr11.50 to
FFr349.40 on heavy volume of 577,960 shares after Tuesday's results.
Nouvelles Galeries remained suspended at its April 26 price of FFr780.
Galeries Lafayette rose FFr13 to FFr1,720; the stores company, which has
been forced to bid for Nouvelles Galeries after raising its stake, offered
FFr863.50 a share.
FRANKFURT rose as institutional buy orders hit a dry market and on the news
that the Bundesbank had left interest rates unchanged at its regular
meeting.
The DAX index advanced 24.25 or 1.5 per cent to 1,630.04, its highest close
since August 30. The FAZ index, calculated at midsession, put on 9.21 or 1.4
per cent to 689.97. Volume rose to DM5.8bn from DM4.1bn.
Bank shares rose on interest rate optimism. Deutsche Bank jumped DM12.50 to
DM656.30 and Dresdner Bank climbed DM7 to DM380.
Viag, the diversified utility group which has bought the European activities
of Continental Can of the US, rose DM4 to DM362. After the market closed,
Viag said its new shares to be issued as part of a one-for-eight capital
increase would be priced at DM285 each.
In the retail sector, Karstadt fell DM6.50 to DM647.50 on profit-taking
after its recent strength. In pharmaceuticals, Schering eased DM4.70 to
DM773.50 after the company said it expected 1991 group earnings to be flat.
MILAN was led higher by the banking and insurance sectors. The Comit index
rose 5.72 to 581.53 but volume remained thin at an estimated L120bn.
Generali, the country's largest insurer, rose L390 to L36,840 while
Mediobanca advanced L350 to L15,950.
Tuesday's settlement of the battle for control of the publisher Mondadori
continued to focus attention on the shares involved. Trading in Mondadori
non-convertible savings shares was suspended until the close, when they were
set at L14,600, up 13.2 per cent or L1,700, while L'Espresso, the newspaper
and magazine publisher, surged L2,200 or 9.6 per cent to L25,000.
In telecommunications, Sirti rose L390 or 3.1 per cent to L12,970 after
winning a big contract from Sip.
But Benetton, the leisure clothes manufacturer, was held back by further
details of its planned capital increase. The company said at its annual
meeting just before May Day that it planned to raise up to L15bn nominal or
30m shares by the end of 1993, possibly via a convertible bond. The shares
rose L50 to L8,450.
AMSTERDAM came off the day's highs on profit-taking as the dollar fell back.
The CBS tendency index closed 0.8 up at 96.2 after hitting 96.5 earlier.
Philips advanced another Fl 1 to Fl 30 after its good first-quarter results
the previous day. But DSM, the chemical company, fell Fl 1 to Fl 114.30 on
lower-than-expected first-quarter results.
ZURICH's Credit Suisse index rose 2.9 to 552.5. CS Holding's bearers gained
SFr60 to SFr2,160 and its registered shares added SFr8 to SFr405 after its
1990 results. The group's shares had fallen on the announcement of a
dividend cut, but recovered on the news that shareholders would be offered a
bonus option.
OSLO's volume was boosted by activity in pharmaceutical company Hafslund.
Turnover grew from NKr388m to NKr629m, with about NKr161m accounted for by
Hafslund, which rose NKr4 to NKr187 after better-than-expected first-quarter
results.
COPENHAGEN saw further foreign demand for Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical
company. It rose DKr11 to DKr435 on volume of 105,954 shares. Danisco gained
another DKr13 to DKr960 after its purchase of east German sugar factories.
ISTANBUL continued to recover from its sharp falls in the first two days
this week. The index gained 196.53 or 5.2 per cent to 3,985.84.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Money Markets: A softer tone
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST RATES declined on the London money market yesterday, with
three-month sterling interbank virtually discounting another cut of 1/2
point in UK bank base rates.
The Bank of England discouraged speculation about lower rates however by not
supplying enough help to take out the full underlying credit shortage on the
cash market. This kept overnight money firm.
Trading was cautious, waiting for the results of yesterday's local
government elections.
Tuesday's reduction in the US discount rate has encouraged hopes of lower UK
rates. There was little reaction to news that the German Bundesbank left its
credit policies unchanged at yesterday's council meeting.
Three-month sterling interbank fell to 11 5/8 -11 1/2 from 11-11 9/16 per
cent, while 12-month money was unchanged at 11 5/16 -11 3/16 per cent.
Short sterling futures were steady on Liffe. June delivery opened at 88.84
and closed at the same level, compared with 88.85 previously.
Day-to-day credit was in short supply on the cash market. The Bank of
England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 1,000m, but revised this to
Pounds 950m at noon and to Pounds 1,050m in the afternoon.
An early round of help was offered and at that time the authorities bought
Pounds 144m bills outright, by way of Pounds 5m bank bills in band 1 at 11
7/8 per cent; Pounds 1m Treasury bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent; and
Pounds 138m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent.
Before lunch another Pounds 288m bills were purchased, via Pounds 269m bank
bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 19m Treasury bills in band 2
at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon Pounds 162m bank bills were bought in
band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and late assistance of around Pounds 210m was also
provided.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 792m, with exchequer transactions absorbing
Pounds 30m, a rise in the note circulation Pounds 135m and bank balances
below target Pounds 45m.
In Frankfurt call money eased to 8.90 from 8.95 per cent in comfortable
credit conditions at the beginning of a new trading month. As expected the
German Bundesbank left credit policies unchanged at yesterday's council
meeting, with the discount rate remaining at 6.50 per cent and the Lombard
emergency financing rate at 9 per cent.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC agrees preliminary meat deal
with US
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE EC yesterday reached preliminary agreement with the US over Brussels'
ban on American meat coming into the Community, European Commission
officials said yesterday.
This appears to defuse a row that has been raging since 1983, which
culminated in total bans on pigmeat imports from October 31 last year, and
on beef from the start of this year. Washington began action against the EC
within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in January, but had
delayed a formal disputes procedure pending negotiations.
EC veterinary experts say hygiene is deficient in US abbatoirs, with
insufficient post-mortem inspections and a high incidence of trichina worms
in pigs. US exports to the EC dropped in the period 1980-90 from 76,000
tonnes to 4,500 tonnes of beef, and from 44,000 to 11,000 tonnes of pigmeat.
Last year's total ban affected Dollars 13.5m of US prime beef and Dollars
100m of pork and pork offal.
Following meetings in Washington between Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture
commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, US secretary for agriculture, Community
vets will reinspect US abbatoirs next month. 'They will have to meet certain
minimum criteria which we will insist on,' a spokesman for Mr MacSharry
stressed.
But he expected that many would be relicensed, and that broader agreement on
mutual recognition of hygiene standards would be reached. Agreement in a
separate dispute over trichinosis in US horsemeat also looked likely, the
official added.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Maintaining the coal export
momentum - Guerrilla threats and investment costs in Colombia's mining
country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLOMBIA has become one of the world's top suppliers of steam coal within
six years of joining the export business.
Between 1984 and 1990, exports rose from 1m tonnes to 14m tonnes, and
Colombia secured nearly 8 per cent of the international market. But
retaining this means expanding coal production rapidly at a time when
guerrilla armies are waging an economic war and costly investments in
transport are overdue.
Some 85 per cent of Colombia's steam coal exports are mined in the northern
zone of El Cerrejon by the Colombian state coal company (Carbocol) and the
Exxon subsidiary, Intercor. The mine is already producing nearly 13m tonnes
a year, close to the 15m tonne goal set for 1995. Experts say it would be
possible to increase El Cerrejon's output by a further 5m tonnes without
substantial expense.
However, coal is still not profitable enough to justify large investments in
infrastructure for new projects, especially as Colombia's two main guerrilla
armies - the ELN and the FARC - have united to inflict maximum damage on the
oil and mining sectors.
The targets are not only the multinationals - Carbones del Caribe, a small
scale operator, had more than a dozen heavy vehicles burned and two hired
river tugs destroyed by guerrillas in the first two months of this year.
The location of El Cerrejon, away from guerrilla-invested areas, is one of
the mine's big advantages. Coal supplies are stable, particularly now that
early production difficulties have been cleared up. But a sizeable part of
Colombia's most important and accessible steam coal reserves at La Loma, La
Jagua and El Descanso in the department of Cesar, and San Jorge in Cordoba,
lie well within guerrilla range, and at least some of these deposits will
have to be developed over the next few years, if, as Carbocol plans, exports
are to rise to 26m tonnes by 1995 and 40m tonnes by the end of the century.
Carbocol has a USDollars 1.6bn debt, and is not undertaking any big new
ventures. Although El Cerrejon's operating accounts have been in the black
for two years, Carbocol's financial costs are such that the state company
continues to make a loss. Large-scale development of the coal basins which
have already been explored - Carbocol estimates reserves at 21bn tonnes in
eight regions - depends mainly on attracting foreign capital.
As part of the policy to build an 'energy axis' between Venezuela, Colombia
and Mexico, the Colombian government had hoped to draw Mexican investment to
mine the deposits at El Descanso, with the output fuelling Mexican power
stations. Carbocol calculates that El Descanso could produce up to 10m
tonnes a year, but Mexico's demand for coal is not growing as fast as
expected, and the future of the project is uncertain.
More than two years ago, the US company, Drummond, announced plans to invest
nearly USDollars 600m in the development of La Loma, and the construction of
a rail link and shipping facilities. Exports are due to begin in 1993, with
annual production eventually rising to 10m tonnes. But though La Loma's
steam coal is good quality and cheap to mine, the risks for a multinational
working in guerrilla territory may prove too daunting. The company has not
built any camp or other installations at La Loma as yet, according to a
recent visitor to the area.
Thus, the extra coal for the mid-1990s may have to be supplied by El
Cerrejon and Colombia's private sector companies. Carbones del Caribe
exported about 1m tonnes last year, and, in spite of guerrilla damage and
threats to installations in both Cesar and Cordoba, aims to produce 1.5m
tonnes in 1991. However, Carbones del Caribe has had to patch together
awkward and vulnerable shipping arrangements by rail and river to the
Caribbean ports.
The expansion of the central mining zone of El Cerrejon, which has proven
reserves of 600m tonnes to a depth of 150 metres, has also been held up by
access problems. The trucking system used until now is inefficient.
Producing several million tonnes of coal a year would require a more
integrated solution, such as the purpose-built railway and port in the
northern zone. The Prodeco port near Santa Marta is the nearest, but has a
limited capacity, and Prodeco plans to produce some 3m tonnes a year in the
Calenturitas zone of La Loma.
The construction of special coal ports close to beauty spots and tourist
centres has triggered environmental protests. The main cities of
Barranquilla, Cartagena and Santa Marta are controversial sites and coal
shipments have already been disrupted because of alleged contamination.
These sudden hold-ups are not only costly, but affect a company's reputation
for reliable deliveries.
Pollution difficulties are aggravated by strong winds along the Caribbean
coast, which raise dust even when the coal is well-watered. The industry
argues that, with properly built facilities and effective controls, there is
little danger of contamination. But, as one Colombian ecologist pointed out,
most companies are simply not prepared to exercise the discipline or meet
the extra cost. At present, possible sites for coal ports include
Barranquilla and Cienaga, while existing installations could also be
upgraded.
Coal has become Colombia's third export earner, after coffee and oil. Last
year's sales, mainly to European countries, brought in more than USDollars
500m, with the UK, Holland, Denmark and France as Colombia's most important
European customers. Smaller amounts of coal go to the US, the Far East, and
local Caribbean and Latin American countries.
Marketing experts believe Colombia's high quality coal will continue to be
very competitive in Europe, particularly as demand in the Far East
strengthens and absorbs more Australian coal, and as European production and
pricing policies are shaken up by changes after 1992.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar surplus estimate soars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD sugar supply and demand balance is heading for a surplus of 4.6m
tonnes for 1990-91 - the biggest surplus since 1982-83, according to ED &amp; F.
Man, the London trade house.
Man's sharp upward revision of the surplus from an estimate of 1.9m tonnes
comes in a week when sugar prices hit their lowest levels for more than
three years. On Tuesday the London Daily Price for raws was Dollars 194 a
tonne, the lowest level since November 1987.
The latest estimate compares with a 3.33m tonne surplus predicted by FO
Licht, the German statistician, in February, and a surplus of 1.2m tonnes
made in the same month by Czarnikow, another large London trade house, which
is expected to revise its estimate upwards later this month.
Man's latest monthly sugar review predicts that prices will be further
depressed by the 'weight of the existing, as well as the impending supply
surpluses'. When added to a revised surplus of 1.7m tonnes for 1989-90, the
total accumulation of sugar from the two seasons is 6.3m tonnes.
Production this season is now put at 113.8m tonnes, compared with a previous
estimate of 110.4m tonnes and 1989-90 production of 108.7m tonnes. 'This is
the largest annual increase since 1981-82; with beet production increasing
by over 5 per cent and cane by 4.4 per cent and it is a testimony to the
response of sugar producers to the higher world prices in 1989 and 1990,'
says the review.
Adjustments to production estimates for China, India and Thailand account
for 2.1m tonnes or more than 60 per cent of the total increase.
The consumption forecast is little changed at 109.2m tonnes.
About two thirds of this season's forecast surplus is held in stock by
traditional importing countries such as the US, India and Mexico, says Man.
Usually these countries only re-export at times of high world prices, but
this season, 'influenced more by logistical and domestic financial
considerations', both India and Mexico have sold sugar.
Recent talk of Mexican sales to China has been one of the factors depressing
prices. Man believes that any purchases would be surplus to China's domestic
needs, and that it is rebuilding depleted stocks.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Early gold price revival
'unlikely'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN early gold price revival is unlikely given current investor
disenchantment with the metal, a leading South African mining executive said
yesterday.
But Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer, chairman of Anglo American Gold Investment
(Amgold), an investment company with interests in gold and uranium mines in
South Africa, and in gold operations in Australia and the Far East, said in
his annual review that gold had not necessarily lost its traditional role as
a store of wealth.
He said: 'The multitude of factors impinging on the gold price, and its
resilience at lower levels during the past few years, suggest that it would
be wrong to conclude that bullion has been permanently displaced as a store
of value.'
The market appeared to be constrained by a ceiling imposed by producers,
investors and speculators who sell on any rally as prices head towards
Dollars 400 an ounce. A price floor has emerged above Dollars 355 an ounce.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Group sees growing silver
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SILVER market is facing a growing deficit which could reach 100m ounces
this year, according to American Precious Metals Advisors, the consultancy
group.
This is contrary to a popular belief - based on faulty supply and demand
data - in a surplus for the market, which is suffering from weak prices and
growing warehouse stocks.
'Nothing is further from the truth,' says the group in a silver review. 'The
silver market in recent years has been in deficit: industrial and coinage
demand exceeds current supplies from mine production, scrap recovery and
government disposals.'
The review claims that most information on the silver market is wide of the
mark. For example, most analyses estimate that annual photographic
consumption in the past few years has been between 190m and 210m ounces.
This does not include consumption by film manufacturing plants in Mexico,
Brazil, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, it says.
Similarly, the newly industrialised countries' use of silver in the
electronics sector, the second biggest consumer of silver, is not properly
accounted for in generally accepted statistics.
In spite of the rapid growth of silver usage in the newly industrial
countries, the accepted view is that demand outside the US, Japan and
Western Europe has increased by only 10m ounces to 20m ounces since the
1970s, says the review.
'This is absolutely impossible: first, the industrialised nations have been
major importers of manufactured goods - manufactured goods with high silver
content - from these newly industrialised countries. Second, rising
prosperity in many of those countries has led to rapid growth in domestic
demand for silver-containing photographic film and electronic goods.'
The review says its own statistics should be seen as 'presenting a blurred
picture of reality', with total consumption, if anything understated, at
590m ounces. It puts total supply slightly down this year at 481m ounces.
The real problem of the silver market is that investors, particularly in the
US, 'no longer wish to hold silver that has been accumulated and hoarded for
years if not decades.
'The declining price of silver reflects a continuing desire on the part of
investors to reduce their portfolio holdings, But, each year, aggregate
silver holdings can decline by no more than the annual deficit.'
This disinvestment, which will be able to satisfy substantial market
deficits for years to come, explains the declining price and the build-up in
visible warehouse stocks.
'Given this situation, the only thing that will force silver prices higher
during the next year is a change in investor and speculator sentiment
towards silver,' the review says. While long term hoarders are abandoning
silver, the market action will be dominated by the behaviour of traders and
speculators.

FT  03 MAY 91 / FT Law Report: Arbitrators cannot hear claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD ERA
Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hobhouse: March 27
1991
AN ARBITRATOR'S jurisdiction on a reference asserting loss to charterers in
their own right by shipowners' breach of charterparty, is limited to that
cause of action; and he therefore has no jurisdiction to hear an amended
claim arising out of a different cause of action in that the charterers
claim as agents for loss suffered by their principals as a result of the
same breach.
Mr Justice Hobhouse so held when making a limited declaration in favour of
the plaintiffs, Leif Heogh and Co A/S, disponent owners of World Era, that
arbitrators on a claim by the defendant charterers, Petrolsea Inc, had no
jurisdiction to hear amendments to the Points of Claim in so far as
Petrolsea claimed as agents for an undisclosed principal. He rejected the
plaintiffs' claim that the arbitrators had no jurisdiction on the ground
that the amendments were time-barred.
HIS LORDSHIP said that a tanker voyage charterparty dated October 24 1980
between disponent owners of World Era and the charterers, was one of a tier
of charterparties.
The actual owners had chartered the vessel to the disponent owners on terms
similar to those between the disponent owners and the charterers. The
charterers subchartered the vessel on back to back terms. The charterers and
sub-charterers were both subsidiaries of companies in the Marc Rich &amp; Co AG
group.
In November 1980 the vessel loaded cargo at two Gulf ports for carriage to
ports in Italy and Sardinia, issuing bills of lading naming those discharge
ports. After the vessel had sailed, the charterers ordered the vessel to
discharge at Durban in South Africa. They contended that under their
charterparty with the disponent owners they were entitled to give that
order.
The disponent owners passed on the order to the head owners who refused to
accept it, and the disponent owners passed that refusal back to the
charterers.
The upshot was that the cargo was eventually discharged at Bonaire in the
Caribbean.
The charterers said that certain expenses had been incurred in supplying
substitute cargo to South African purchasers.
In 1981 arbitrators were appointed in respect of a claim by the charterers
against the disponent owners for damages for breach of the charterparty in
refusing the order to discharge in South Africa.
Points of Claim were served in November 1984. They described the arbitration
as between charterers as claimants and disponent owners as respondents; and
referred to the charterparty an agreement between claimant charterers and
respondent disponent owners.
It was pleaded that by reason of the disponent owners' breach of charter in
refusing to discharge at Durban, the claimants had suffered loss and damage
and/or had incurred liability to indemnify the sub-charterers.
The claim amounted to about Dollars 4,784.
The disponent owners raised defences and counterclaims.
In preparing their case as the years passed by, it occurred to those acting
for the charterers that they might have difficulty in substantiating and
proving their claim as alleged. The charterers discovered after all that
time that they had not been contracting on their own behalf but on behalf of
Marc Rich, a fact not previously disclosed. In March 1990 they sent the
disponent owners draft amended Points of Claim.
The amendments did not seek to alter the parties to the arbitration. They
remained charterers as claimants and disponent owners as respondents. They
did not alter the previous allegations with regard to the charterparty and
the parties to it.
However, they added an allegation that 'the charterparty was made by the
claimants as agents for undisclosed principals, Marc Rich'.
The damages claim was recast. It was alleged that the claimants 'and/or
their principals Marc Rich' had suffered loss and damage and/or the
claimants had incurred a liability to indemnify the sub-charterers 'and/or
Marc Rich' in respect of loss and damage suffered by them.
All the previous particulars were deleted. Allegations were substituted
regarding Marc Rich's liabilities to a South African company, and the agency
relationship. The final particular alleged in the alternative that if,
contrary to the claimant's case, the claimants were not agents for Marc
Rich, they were principals and the loss was suffered by them as such.
On the present originating summons the disponent owners asked for a
declaration that the arbitrators had no jurisdiction to hear the amendments,
on the ground that they were outside the terms of the reference to
arbitration, or were time-barred.
Section 5 of the Limitation Act 1980, and its predecessor in the 1939 Act,
provided that an action founded on simple contract should not be brought
after six years from when the cause of action accrued.
By section 34(3) an arbitration commenced where the appropriate steps to
appoint, or to require the appointment of an arbitrator had been carried
out.
The character of the time limit did not go to jurisdiction. It merely
provided a defence to the claim. If the defence was disputed, as it was
here, the arbitrators must decide it.
It followed that in so far as the attack on jurisdiction was founded on time
bar, it was misconceived and must fail.
The disponent owners accepted that all the matters now within the amended
Points of Claim could have been referred to arbitration by the charterers in
1981. They said they were not so referred.
The cause of action on which the charterers relied in 1981 when referring
the dispute to arbitration and appointing their arbitrator, was the
disponent owners' alleged breach of charter in declining to deliver in South
Africa.
That was the original cause of action, in respect of which the arbitrators
were appointed. Subject to one point it remained the cause of action which
the charterers sought to enforce. No new breach of charterparty was alleged
or relied on.
That was sufficient to dispose of most of the points on which the disponent
owners relied in their attack on jurisdiction.
But, in one respect the charterers, although still putting themselves
forward as the only claimant in the arbitration, did purport to raise a new
or different cause of action.
That was the allegation that they were entitled to recover not only in their
own right, but in right of Marc Rich.
In the clause pleading loss and damage, in so far as the charterers alleged
that they had incurred liability to indemnify the sub-charterers and/or Marc
Rich, those were matters properly pleaded and relevant to their claim.
In so far as they also alleged that 'their principals, Marc Rich' had
suffered loss and damage, the charterers were going beyond what they could
claim by their asserted cause of action.
To recover in the right of another was to assert a cause of action of that
other person. Such cause of action had not been referred to prior to
delivery of the draft amendments in 1990.
On the face of it it was a new cause of action not included in the original
reference.
The only entity that had claimed arbitration and referred its claim to the
arbitrators was the charterers.
Marc Rich chose not to make a reference. All it had done was to cause its
agents, the charterers, to claim in the right of Marc Rich. That was not
permissible within the existing reference. In the absence of a further
reference, that claim must be excluded.
Once one had identified that a claim in the right of Marc Rich was not
within the reference, questions of the extent of recovery to which the
charterers were entitled in their own right, fell within the arbitrators'
jurisdiction.
In so far as the amended Points of Claim alleged that the charterers were
contracting agents for undisclosed principals, that the principals suffered
loss and damage, and that the charterers were entitled to recover damages in
the right of the sub-charterers and Marc Rich, they made claims and raised
disputes which had not been referred and which the arbitrators did not have
jurisdiction to decide.
For the plaintiff disponent owners: Bernard Eder QC and John Lockey
(Sinclairs).
For the defendant charterers: Michael Howard QC and Nigel Meeson (Clyde &amp;
Co).

HAS the property market hit the bottom? As economic confidence starts to
creep back, some of the optimists in the property industry are calling the
turn. 'All indicators now point to the bottom of the market having been
reached, with the time ripe for institutional investment,' says Edward
Erdman, the chartered surveyor.
Signs of a revival in confidence are plentiful, if tentative. Property is
now so cheap in relation to gilts, that hitherto bearish commentators are
recommending that institutions increase their holdings. In fact, yields have
risen so far that property is virtually being valued as a fixed-income
asset. That has fuelled buying interest from companies and individuals, such
as Alan Sugar who sold Pounds 34m of Amstrad shares to go back into the
property market.
Continental investors, attracted by the reduced currency risk from the UK's
entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism are also showing interest. And after
two desperately quiet years, cautious buyers have re-emerged for property
unit trusts.
Appearances, however, may deceive. While certain parts of the property
market may have hit bottom, it is far from being a broadly-based recovery.
'Thinly disguised untruths about imminent recovery are very foolish,'
comments Mr Rupert Nabarro of Investment Property Databank, which has just
conducted an annual review into the investment property market. Moreover,
the share market, which has proved a reliable guide to future events, has
just pushed property shares relative to the rest of the market to a 22-year
low.
The reason for caution lies in the divergence between the investment market
and the occupiers' market, which has been ravaged by the recession. Concern
is focused on the unprecedented problems in the central London office
market.
Thanks to the overbuilding that followed the deregulation of planning
controls and the over-expansion of the financial services industry after Big
Bang in 1986, London's office vacancy rate far outstrips the 11 per cent
experienced after the 1974 collapse. 'The figures are by any standards -
absolute, historical or whatever - awful and imply a collapse in rents in
central London,' says Chris Walls of Salomon Brothers.
After the 1974 crash, rents fell by 40 per cent from their peak. This time,
in Salomon's view, the fall could be just as severe. Some brokers think even
this is too optimistic. One believes that rents could fall 60 per cent from
their peak.
The result is that capital values will probably fall, even if yields
partially recover. And a partial recovery is expected even by the bears at
Salomon. 'Unfortunately, there is rarely much (if any) correlation between
the property market and logic,' says Chris Walls. 'As interest rates fall,
the pressure on short-term market operators will ease, and they will no
longer find it so urgent to sell at current yield levels.'
Another reason for expecting yields to fall is that turnover in much of the
market has virtually ground to a halt, thanks to the mismatch between
buyers' and sellers' expectations.
Once prices do improve, however, the supply of property may vastly increase
as institutions and companies resume the rationalisation of their portfolios
and banks push more companies into receivership. If so, it is not clear
where the demand will come from.

FT  03 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: JP Morgan takes first IPO
lead in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. P. Morgan is lead managing its first initial public offering (IPO) of
shares since it was granted permission to underwrite equities by the US
Federal Reserve Board in September last year.
The bank is leading the international tranche of a 96m share offering for
Ayala Land, a Philippine real estate company. Formed in 1988, Ayala Land is
the real estate subsidiary of Ayala Corporation, the Philippines oldest
trading company.
Of the shares for sale, 31m are being sold by the parent company and 65m are
new. The international tranche amounts to 38m shares, priced at 26 pesos
each, equivalent to about Dollars 1 per share.
The domestic issue is being lead managed by Bank of the Philippine Islands,
in which J. P. Morgan has a 20 per cent stake. The shares will be listed on
the Makati and Manila stock exchanges.
J. P. Morgan reported strong Far Eastern demand for the stock, centred on
Hong Kong and Singapore. Allocation of shares will close on May 17.
J. P. Morgan was the first of the US money-centre banks to be granted
permission to underwrite and deal in equity securities.
In January, the firm lead-managed its first equity offering of any kind  - a
Dollars 58.5m rights issue for Electra Aviation, a privately-owned UK
aircraft leasing company.
In addition to straight share offerings, the bank has also been active in
equity-related bonds. Last month, it lead managed a Dollars 150m
subordinated convertible bond offering for Dow Chemical in the US market.

THE PACE of mergers and acquisitions in Canada's oil and gas industry soared
to a record in the first three months of this year.
Sayer Securities of Calgary reported that 222 deals, valued at CDollars 910m
(Dollars 791.30m) were signed in the first quarter, compared with 174 in the
previous three months.
The biggest transaction was Gulf Canada's CDollars 100m sale of its working
interest in the Caroline natural gas field in Alberta to Shell Canada. Sayer
estimates that assets and companies worth CDollars 3.6bn were still up for
sale at the end of March, down from CDollars 4.1bn three months earlier.
Since then, however, Olympia &amp; York, the real estate and natural resources
group controlled by Toronto's Reichmann family, has disclosed that it has
received offers for its controlling interest in Home Oil of Calgary.
Amoco Canada Petroleum has also announced plans for a further
reorganisation. On the other hand, PanCanadian Petroleum, the energy arm of
Canadian Pacific, has expressed interest in making a sizeable acquisition.
Merger and takeover activity in Canada's oil and gas industry has been at a
high pitch for the past three or four years. The main sellers have been
companies such as Esso Resources, Amoco, Gulf Canada and Petro-Canada.
The most active buyers have included fast-growing companies, such as Chauvco
Resources, Inverness Petroleum and Poco Petroleums.

FT  03 MAY 91 / International Bonds: Cheaper rates encourage three Canadian
issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE Canadian dollar Eurobonds were launched in the international capital
markets yesterday as European investors returned after Wednesday's May Day
holiday.
The Eurobond market is now offering cheaper rates than the domestic market,
even for Canadian borrowers which have historically found the domestic
market a cheaper source of funds.
The domestic market suffered a setback this week when the Province of
Ontario's triple-A rated debt was placed under review for possible
downgrading by Standard &amp; Poor's, following a disappointing budget.
Ontario's debt provides a pricing benchmark for much of the domestic market,
so spreads over the government bond market widened 6 or 7 basis points.
Eurobond spreads also widened, but soon recovered.
The largest deal of the day was a CDollars 250m three-year deal for the
Province of Saskatchewan, considered attractively priced at a 75 basis point
margin above the comparable Canadian government bond. Placement was split
between institutional and retail investors in Europe, according to lead
manager Wood Gundy.
While other Canadian provinces have been frequent visitors to the Eurobond
market this year, reflecting both increased borrowing needs and improved
European demand, single-A rated Saskatchewan had until now found the
domestic market a cheaper source of funds.
The Canadian municipality of Hamilton tapped the market with a CDollars 75m
issue of retractable notes, a structure usually reserved for the domestic
market. The 15-year deal, puttable after five and 10-years, is targetted at
institutional investors.
Also in the Canadian dollar sector, Petrofina, the Belgian oil company,
launched a CDollars 100m issue, which met firm demand among yield-hungry
investors in Benelux. Petrofina is Belgium's largest company, but its lack
of credit rating tends to deter investors elsewhere. The company is
currently seeking a rating.
In Germany, Nichii, the Japanese department store chain, launched the
largest ever D-mark equity-linked deal for a Japanese borrower. The DM500m
four-year deal was quoted below its par issue price at 99 1/2 offered.
Japanese equity warrant deals are normally expected to trade above their
issue price in the primary market.
A Pounds 100m four-year deal for the Nationwide Anglia Building Society via
Baring Brothers was considered aggressively priced, at a yield spread of 81
basis points above the 10 1/4 per cent gilt due 1995. However, lead manager
Baring Brothers pointed out that other paper at that area of the yield curve
was trading substantially over par, which deters many investors.

sustained
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government sold FFr7.77bn of bonds at yesterday's regular monthly
auction, with demand sustained despite the lull in activity caused by this
fortnight's market holidays.
The auction puts the government well ahead in its borrowing programme for
1991, with a total of FFr52bn raised so far in bond issues compared with a
full-year target of FFr100bn.
The Tresor had announced a target range of FFr6bn to FFr8bn before
yesterday's auction, but the non-competitive bids which primary dealers are
allowed to submit after the auction at the average price are expected to
take the amount raised over this level.
Bids concentrated on the main 10-year tap stock, OAT 9.5 per cent 2001,
where the Tresor accepted FFr3.74bn out of FFr12.4bn of bids. The cut-off
price of 104.50 gives a weighted average yield of 8.78 per cent, 25 basis
points lower than at last month's auction.
The government sold a further FFr2.575bn of OAT 8.25 per cent 2004 at a
cut-off price of 95.65, giving a yield of 8.82 per cent. It also accepted
bids for FFr1.45bn of OAT 8.5 per cent 2019, its longest dated bond, at a
cut-off price of 95.95, giving an average yield of 8.88 per cent.

FT  03 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: OM launches German stock
index contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first German stock index option contract, launched today by the
Swedish-owned OM exchange in London, will fill a gaping hole in the market,
according to traders.
Until now, fund managers or traders wishing to hedge positions in the German
stock market have only been able to use over-the-counter products,
individual stock options, or the DAX future traded on the Deutsche
Terminborse (DTB), the German derivatives exchange.
OM's specially-developed GEMx index, based on 20 actively-traded German
stocks, is well designed and closely tracks the DAX, the standard German
stock market index, according to traders. However, the unfamiliarity of the
GEMx compared with the DAX is likely to discourage some potential users,
options experts suggested.
'The GEMx option contract stands a reasonable chance of success,' according
to one options specialist. 'But the natural place to trade German index
options is the DTB.'
The DTB now hopes to launch its DAX index option on August 9. Traders say
OM's best chance for success is further delay in the DTB contract, or a
period of volatility in the German stock market to bolster activity.
But the DTB has already found to its cost that lost business can be hard to
recover: the exchange has so far had little success in winning back German
Bund futures business from the London International Financial Futures
Exchange, which was quicker of the mark.
However, the DTB's successful DAX future provides a foothold. That contract
trades around 4,000 contracts a day, and the exchange is planning to launch
an option on the future (in addition to the index option) early next year.
OM also has a strong core business, with an investor base ranging from UK
fund managers and traders to Swedish retail investors. Its OMX Swedish index
option is one of the most actively traded index products, with 20,000 to
25,000 contracts a day on average.

FT  03 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Securities clearing plan on
course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST of the clearing and settlement systems supporting the world's biggest
securities markets are still on course to meet internationally agreed
standards of performance by the end of next year, according to a report*
from the Group of Thirty.
However, a number of countries - including the UK, Spain, Italy, Australia
and Hong Kong - face substantial developments if they are not to fall
farther behind. Within Europe particularly, the efficiency and security of
settlement arrangements have become an important aspect of the competition
between national exchanges.
G30, an international group of financial and economic experts chaired by
Lord Richardson, a former governor of the Bank of England, laid down a
series of recommended standards in 1989.
These include the creation of central securities depositories, delivery
versus payment mechanisms (to ensure cash and securities change hands
simultaneously) and rolling settlement, with all transactions being settled
three days after the trade date. The deadline set for most targets is the
end of next year.
A series of progress reports from 21 countries, published by G30 this week,
show that most expect to be able to reach the targets on time. In an
introduction to the report, Lord Richardson paid tribute to what he called
'impressive' efforts, given the 'substantial investment' called for at a
difficult time for the industry, and the fact that many changes would result
in upheavals in working practice.
Some of the most developed settlement systems still lack key elements, Lord
Richardson said. These include those in Japan, which is about to start
loading information onto its central depository, France, which has yet to
move to rolling settlement, and the US, which faces considerable opposition
from the retail market in moving to three-day rolling settlement.
Greater difficulties face countries like the UK, he added. 'With a
paper-based system, no comprehensive central depository, no rolling
settlement and no satisfactory delivery versus payment, the UK has a long
and difficult hill to climb.'

<TEXT>
MINORCO, the international mining group, is coming to the rescue of Canada's
Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting by offering to buy the struggling northern
Manitoba base metal producer from its 56 per cent-owned US subsidiary,
Inspiration Resources.
Minorco, part of the empire controlled by South Africa's Oppenheimer family,
has offered to pay CDollars 100m (USDollars 86.9m) in cash for Hudson Bay,
unless Inspiration finds another buyer before July 1.
Minorco will also advance CDollars 20m in interim financing for a CDollars
187m project to modernise Hudson Bay's facilities and comply with Canadian
environmental regulations.
Without the modernisation, the new anti-pollution rules would force the
closure of most of Hudson Bay's operations in early 1994.
Inspiration and Hudson Bay have so far been unable to secure financing for
the project.
Minorco said that its pledge of interim financing is conditional on the
Canadian and Manitoba governments agreeing to contribute CDollars 80m
towards the modernisation project.

CANADIAN PACIFIC will report a profit for all 1991, Mr William Stinson, its

1990 total of CDollars 355m (USDollars 309m), or CDollars 1.11 a share,
because of the long North American recession.
He said forest products hold the key to CP's immediate outlook. Its 80 per
cent-owned Canadian Pacific Forest Products is one of North America's
biggest pulp and paper products groups, but is unlikely to return to profits
till 1992.
On Tuesday, the group reported a first-quarter loss of CDollars 5.3m, or 2
cents a share, its first quarterly loss since 1986. Most analysts put total
1991 earnings at 65 to 70 cents a share. CP's restructuring of the past five
years is mostly completed and it is well placed for recovery when the
economy improves.

NEW ZEALAND'S biggest chain of retail stores, Smiths City Group, has been
placed into receivership after its bankers demanded repayment of NZDollars
45m (USDollars 26.5m).
The chain of 90 stores has been closed, probably until Monday.
The board has been endeavouring to restructure the company, and the
chairman, Mr Bill Revell, condemned and rejected the bank's decision to
force the receivership.
But Mr Revell was pleased the receivers planned to continue the recovery
plan under which the sale of the larger and profitable stores is proposed.
The group has been under severe financial pressure since it acquired the
North Island group, Smith &amp; Brown, in 1987. It paid a high price and faced
an immediate downturn in trading.
Recently, the company has had to close 20 stores.
Since last year, secured debt has been cut from NZDollars 60m to NZDollars
45m, but the company has continued to struggle with falling retail sales,
which was the reason the banks decided to put control into the hands of
Price Waterhouse as receivers.

<TEXT>
DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, yesterday said net profit fell by 26.4 per
cent to Fl 178m (Dollars 93.7m) in the first quarter of 1991 compared with
the same period last year.
If extraordinary items are excluded from both years, net profit was down
19.1 per cent at Fl 182m, roughly unchanged from the lower final quarter of
1990.
In 1990, DSM posted a 22 per cent decline in net profit excluding
extraordinary items and a 38 per cent drop including these items.
Sales were down 11 per cent at Fl 2.6bn in the 1991 quarter, with most of
the decline attributed to DSM's decision in 1990 to deconsolidate the
results of Macintosh, its 56 per cent-owned retail group.
Selling prices rose an average of 3 per cent, but this was more than offset
by a 5 per cent decline in sales volume, particularly in basic chemicals.
DSM said first-quarter results were also affected by the start-up costs of
new production facilities.
Like other Dutch companies, DSM said it was unable to predict 1991 results
because of the economic uncertainties prevailing on a number of its key
markets.

<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Philips, the Dutch electronics group, yesterday approved a a
simplification of the company's complex structure involving, among other
things, a change of its legal name to Philips Electronics.
The changes end the long-standing division between the former operational
company, NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken (Philips Light Bulb Factories), and
the company which formally holds the group's shares, NV Gemeenschappelijk
Bezit.
By simplifying its structure, Philips has effectively scrapped the weakest
of its three anti-takeover mechanisms but it remains well protected against
a hostile bidder through two layers of preference and priority shares.
Mr Jan Timmer, the head of Philips, addressing his first annual
shareholders' meeting since being elevated to president at an extraordinary
meeting in July, said the group's profitability was still unsatisfactory in
absolute terms.
On Wednesday, Philips unveiled a first-quarter net profit from normal
business operations of Fl 135m (Dollars 71m), a sharp rise from a year
earlier, on turnover of Fl 12.5bn.
Under Mr Timmer, Philips has embarked on a wide programme of restructuring,
including a 20 per cent in the group's worldwide workforce. In an upbeat
assessment of the progress so far, Mr Timmer said a change of mentality was
taking place at Philips, which has long been synonymous with a flabby
bureaucracy and a sluggish reaction to new market conditions.
'Above all, there is once more a winner's mentality within this company,' he
said.
However, Mr Timmer refused to be drawn on whether the company would be in a
position to resume its dividend payments in 1991 after suffering a net loss
of Fl 4.24bn and omitting its payout in 1990. The 1990 loss was due in large
measure to Fl 4.64bn in restructuring charges.

<TEXT>
LURGI, the engineering subsidiary of Germany's Metallgesellschaft group,
plans to float a minority stake in its environmental company later this year
to help finance clean-up operations in east and west Germany.
This will mark a further step in a series of deals involving
Metallgesellschaft. Recent moves have included its acquisition from Davy
Corporation of the UK of Zimmer, the German industrial plant builder which
now comes under Lurgi, and Daimler-Benz's acquisition of a 10 per cent stake
in Metallgesellschaft.
The stock market flotation of the unit,
Lurgi-Umwelt-Beteiligungsgesellschaft(LUB) will be the second 'green' share
issue by the group. Last year, a minority of Metallgesellschaft's recycling
subsidiary, Berzelius Umwelt-Service (BUS), was floated in Frankfurt to
raise DM220m (Dollars 124m)
Mr Jens-Peter Schaefer, Lurgi's chief executive, said it hoped to raise a
similar sum for LUB.
The money would help finance initial investments in the environmental
sector; these would probably be higher than at BUS, since the scope of the
clean-up task on the ground was enormous.

<TEXT>
VIAG, the big German industrial holding company, yesterday confirmed the
acquisition of the European operations of Continental Can of the US. The
deal turns Viag into the second largest packaging company in Europe after
Carnaud-Metal Box.
Viag said it would not be disclosing the price it had paid until next month,
but market estimates put the figure at more than DM1.5bn (Dollars 840m).
Continental Can Europe (CCE) was nearly bought last year by Ball Corporation
for just over Dollars 1bn, but the deal was blocked because of financing
problems.
Since then, the restructuring at CCE's biggest unit, the German can company
Schmalbach-Lubeca, has been completed and profits have increased
substantially.
Viag announced last week that it planned a 1-for-8 rights issue. The pricing
has not yet been announced but it should raise close to DM500m. Analysts
also speculated that Viag may claw-back some of the acquisition price by
placing part of the 64 per cent stake in Schmalbach-Lubeca.
Other CCE companies include Thomassen &amp; Drijver in the Netherlands,
Continental Can UK and Continental France. But Schmalbach-Lubeca accounts
for more than half of CCE's DM3bn in sales and recorded post-tax profits of
DM63m last year after DM40m in 1989.
Mr Brian Wilkinson, an analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London, said
there would be a good fit between Viag's existing packaging operations,
mainly in glass, and the Schmalbach-Lubeca companies.
Viag, which was privatised in 1988, is a complex structure of holdings and
cross-holdings but has six main areas of operation: energy, aluminium,
chemicals, trade and services, ceramics and glass. The trade and services
division was substantially expanded in 1989 through Viag's acquisition of
the trading group Klo(e)ckner &amp; Co for about DM500m.
Viag recorded sales of DM19.5bn and pre-tax profit of DM335m in 1990.

FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: Siemens close to French deal

<TEXT>
SIEMENS NIXDORF, the German computer group, is in the final phase of
negotiating a technical and industrial agreement with SMT-Goupil, France's
last remaining independent maker of microcomputers.
The talks come as SMT-Goupil, the subject of a management buy-out four years
ago, is suffering heavy losses due to the fall in demand and prices that has
crippled the computer industry generally.
Trading in SMT-Goupil's shares was suspended last month, just before it
issued an estimate that it lost 'several hundred million francs' last year
on turnover of around FFr830m (Dollars 139m).
SMT-Goupil was barely profitable in the previous year, with a FFr30m net
surplus on sales of FFr1.8bn.
Neither side will confirm nor deny French press reports that Siemens Nixdorf
is poised to take a 20 per cent stake in SMT-Goupil, though a spokesman for
Siemens Nixdorf yesterday stressed that the German company 'is not
contemplating any involvement in putting SMT-Goupil back on its feet'.
The pair were discussing 'technical and industrial agreements within the
normal scope of business between European industrial companies,' he said.
Whatever the final outcome, this looks set to mark a new foreign advance in
a French computer industry which used to be seen as a strategic national
preserve. Loss-making Bull, France's state-owned computer group, is now
negotiating for NEC, the Japanese electronics group, to take up to 5 per
cent of the group's capital in exchange for NEC's existing 15 per cent stake
in Bull HN, its main overseas subsidiary.
Bull last year boosted the size of its microcomputer business by taking over
Zenith Data Systems of the US, part of Bull's diversification away from its
traditional mainframes business, but which also had the side-effect of
increasing the pressure on smaller microcomputer makers like SMT-Goupil.
Siemens itself bought a controlling stake only two years ago in IN2, a
French producer of IBM-compatible personal computers, from the
Intertechnique electronics group.

FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Blenheim rises 27% to Pounds 18.4m in tough
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLENHEIM GROUP, the exhibition and conference organiser, shrugged off
difficult UK trading conditions to report a 27 per cent advance from Pounds
14.5m to Pounds 18.4m in interim pre-tax profits.
The shares gained 27p in yesterday's rising market to 820p.
Mr Neville Buch, chairman, attributed the profits advance to Blenheim's
strategy of reducing its dependence on any single currency bloc, sector or
event.
'Following the acquisitions made in previous years, we have been
consolidating our position and developing the profitability and prospects
for the group's portfolio of events.'
The dividend for the half-year to February 28 was pitched at 7p (6p) on
earnings per share of 47.4p (40.7p).
The French contribution at Pounds 31.2m (Pounds 31.5m) was again the largest
slice of group turnover of Pounds 71m (Pounds 51m). But the areas of fastest
growth were the US with Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 1.6m), Switzerland Pounds 1.5m
(Pounds 300,000) and the UK with Pounds 16.6m (Pounds 10.5m).
Mr Buch projected that 'further benefits' from acquisitions and from
'ongoing attention to management systems and controls' would materialise in
coming months. Some 95.6 per cent of projected revenues for the full-year
had been realised or contracted.
Interest payments on the group's net debt of Pounds 26.2m more than
quadrupled to Pounds 2.7m and the shareholders' funds figure in the
balance-sheet remained strongly negative.
Interest cover was comfortable enough, with operating profits of Pounds
20.5m (Pounds 14.6m),
The group has decided to change its financial year-end to December 31 with
effect from September 1 1991. Directors intend to recommend two interim
dividends and a final payment during the 16 months to end-December 1992.
COMMENT
Blenheim appears to be growing up. The onset of a period of consolidation
after its rapid expansion of the 1980s is coinciding with a more sober
presentational approach. This may not be unrelated to the hard-nosed
football writer Mr Phil Soar's appointment as group managing director. The
day may even dawn when the company feels embarrassed at the sight of last
year's annual report - a lavish confection of garish birthday cakes and
telescopic candles containing a family portrait of the board sporting 'We
Are 10' lapel badges.
The change of tone is in keeping with Blenheim's evolving circumstances.
Acquisition opportunities will be fewer now that most large commercial
exhibition markets have been rationalised. And the spectacular cost savings
of recent years (the group now pays Pounds 10.25 a sq metre for partition
panels that cost it Pounds 19.50 in 1982) will be harder and harder to keep
going.
In short, the group's fortunes look set increasingly to mirror the
underlying performance of the commercial exhibitions sector. Assuming
full-year profits of Pounds 27m, the prospective multiple is about 12.5.

FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Computing the need for a byte into staffing
levels - IBM UK's radical re-organisation, forced on the company by
recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK subsidiary of International Business Machines (IBM), the world's
largest computer manufacturer, is implementing a radical re-organisation
which will fundamentally affect the way the company does business in Britain
and result in the likely loss of some 1,000 staff between now and 1993.
The shake-up in UK operations is described by Mr Nick Temple, IBM UK's
general manager, as the broadest the company has ever attempted. Indeed it
goes beyond 1989's worldwide re-organisation to combat sluggish sales and
declining profits. That initiative resulted in the elimination of thousands
of jobs and several layers of bureaucracy.
The new measures have been forced on the company by the recession in the UK
which has slowed growth drastically and exposed IBM's comparative
inflexibility and lack of competitiveness.
Last week it announced a rationalisation in its manufacturing activities,
involving the loss of 400 jobs over three years, to improve competitiveness
and its chances of bringing new manufacturing commissions to the UK. IBM
manufacturing units compete with each other in its three principal markets -
the US, Europe and Asia - to win manufacturing 'missions'.
IBM UK's financial performance last year was significantly poorer than the
company as a whole. Revenues grew to Pounds 4.3bn, up only 3 per cent, while
pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 420m (Pounds 459m) in the second year of
declining profitability. Mr Temple believes profits will be either flat or
reduced in the UK this year.
By comparison, the IBM group worldwide turned over Dollars 69bn in 1990, a
10 per cent rise, and pre-tax profits rose 54 per cent to Dollars 10.2bn.
Earlier this year, moreover, IBM intrigued Europe's personal computer
industry by appointing Mr William McCracken as general manager for personal
systems (personal computers) in Europe, only a few months after
responsibility for personal systems throughout the region had been given to
Mr Tony Cleaver, UK chairman and chief executive. Mr McCracken is based at
IBM's European headquarters in Paris. IBM explains the move as a
re-organisation made necessary by the fast-changing nature of the personal
computer business.
Mr Cleaver, Sir Leonard Peach, director of personnel and corporate affairs,
and Mr JB Holmes, director of manufacturing, were involved in the
preparation of the recovery plan, although its overall shape was the
responsibility of Mr Temple, appointed general manager in December last
year. This week Mr Temple denied that his authorship of the plan reflected
any change of emphasis at the top of the company, explaining that Mr
Cleaver's role was focused on IBM UK's external relationships.
Mr Temple has been briefing IBM's top managers on the scheme over the past
few days and they have been filtering the details to the company's 18,000 UK
employees.
Senior management from Armonk, IBM's world headquarters in New York State,
are taking a keen interest in the development of the scheme. IBM now derives
more of its profits from Europe than from the US. The recession in the UK,
however, has proved an early indicator of slowing growth in Europe. The UK
is seen in Armonk, it seems, as a test case of how to deal with a European
market in recession.
The plan has six elements:
An increase of about 600 to 6,300 in the company's direct salesforce with
the objective of bringing more salespeople in touch with customers. Mr
Temple said the number of people involved in buying decisions had multiplied
as information technology spread through companies and the extra salespeople
would be necessary to maintain more comprehensive contacts with customers.
A 20 per cent improvement in the effectiveness of the UK salesforce. Mr
Temple said this would not be measured in extra sales, but would involve
finding ways for salespeople and support staff to spend more time with
customers through the elimination of bureaucracy. He was anxious to improve
speed of response and quality of service via the reduction of management
layers from the present six or seven to five.
A new emphasis on market specialisation. In the past, IBM has presented
itself as a general purpose computer company, willing to tackle any
customer's data processing problem. With increased competition from small,
fast-moving niche market specialists, that approach is no longer viable.
Local government and the public sector were among the areas where IBM
intended to concentrate its efforts. He would not say where the company
intended to back-pedal.
An increased concentration on computing services, the fastest-growing area
of the computer industry. This includes not only computer software but also
facilities management - where the company runs a computer centre on behalf
of a customer - systems integration and information technology consultancy.
There are 400 staff on the computing services side at present; the idea is
to increase that number to 2,000 through redeployment of existing staff.
Reorganisation of the products side of the company into a number of business
units, self-contained in their operations, but not independent of the rest
of the company. There will be product business units dealing with, for
example, mainframes, mid-range systems and with the company's open systems
products which use IBM's AIX operating system.
An experiment which has turned the branch at Richmond, London, into a field
business unit functioning as a profit centre rather than a revenue centre is
to be extended to the rest of the country. Some 30-40 business units are to
be established by the end of the year.
A new emphasis on selling to small businesses through the addition of a
commercial sector to IBM's traditional marketing areas of manufacturing
industry, banking and finance, and government.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Overseas Investment Trust ended the half-year to March 31 with a net
asset value of 277.6p.
This was little changed from the 277.8p achieved at the end of the
comparable period, but was an improvement on the sharply reduced figure of
213.7p reported at the September year end.
Gross revenue fell 30 per cent from Pounds 1.12m to Pounds 809,000. Interest
took Pounds 90,000 (Pounds 58,000), administrative expenses Pounds 279,000
(Pounds 264,000) and tax Pounds 186,000 (Pounds 301,000), leaving net
revenue of Pounds 254,000 (Pounds 492,000).
The interim dividend is maintained at 0.75p on earnings per share of 0.67p
(1.29p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Forward Group, the USM-quoted supplier of specialist services to the
electronic industry, returned to the black in the year to January 31.
Taxable profits were Pounds 955,000, against losses of Pounds 690,000 last
time and Mr Ray Chamberlain, chairman, said: 'I shall be disappointed if the
current year, with all the difficulties of a continuing recession, does not
show another satisfactory result.'
Turnover rose to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 8.46m) and operating profits emerged
at Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 369,000). After an exceptional gain of Pounds
118,000 (debit Pounds 720,000) relating to money received from a property
disposal offset by re-organisation costs, and a tax charge of Pounds 307,000
(credit Pounds 208,000), earnings per share came out at 8.95p (losses
6.66p).
A final dividend of 1.2p (nil) is proposed for a total of 2.2p (1p).

FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Losses at BDA rise 40% to Pounds 2.17m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BDA Holdings saw losses increase further in the year to January 31 1991 due
to its decision to reduce finished residential property prices to revive
sales momentum.
On sales up 15 per cent at Pounds 7.02m (Pounds 6.08m) the pre-tax loss
increased by 40 per cent from Pounds 1.55m to Pounds 2.17m. Directors of
this south-east-based housebuilder said yesterday that in view of the
continuing uncertain outlook no dividend would be paid. The last
distribution was for 1989.
Directors also reviewed the value of the property portfolio and in addition
to the Pounds 855,000 write-down taken at the time of the rights issue in
August, a further Pounds 190,000 has been provided.
The decision to reduce prices meant that at the year end more than three
quarters of the finished residential stock had been sold and debt reduced to
Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 7.47m). Losses per share came through at 14.6p (11.1p).

Rathbone Brothers, the USM-quoted private banking, investment and financial
services group, raised pre-tax profits by 11 per cent, from Pounds 2.3m to
Pounds 2.55m, in 1990. Turnover expanded 19 per cent to Pounds 7.6m, against
Pounds 6.4m.
Tax took Pounds 908,000 (Pounds 837,000) and earnings per share came to
22.11p (20.75p). The final dividend is 6p, for a total up from 6.6p to 8p.
Mr Oliver Stanley, chairman, said 1991 had begun well and he was confident
that the company could meet growth objectives. Already this year, Rathbone
had expanded its investment business by the recruitment of Mr Ian Tod and
the purchase of his investment business in Liverpool.
The company had restructured its services to help corporate clients with
their financial problems, while the tax return service in Liverpool was
attracting many new customers.

<TEXT>
Bury Retail Parks, a subsidiary of Merlin International Properties, was
wound up yesterday on a petition by Security Pacific National Bank.
Merlin said yesterday it regretted that the bank had been unwilling to
extend the term of the Pounds 6.9m mortgage facility to its subsidiary -
which should have been repaid on November 30 - in order that the property
could be sold in an orderly manner.
The action would have no effect on the trading position of the parent
company and its other subsidiaries, the company said.
The loan was secured on a completed and fully-leased retail park in Bury St
Edmunds, Suffolk. The company said the bank was receiving the full rental
income of Pounds 737,334 a year and there were no parent company guarantees.

EFG yesterday fleshed out its earlier warnings with an announcement that
pre-tax losses of about Pounds 2.2m are expected for the half-year to March

Interest costs are expected to account for Pounds 850,000 of this and in
addition there are likely to be exceptional and extraordinary charges and
provisions amounting to some Pounds 800,000 relating to the board's strategy

Shares in the USM-quoted company, which is involved in forestry,
horticulture and specialised non-food retailing, fell 7p to 19p.
Directors added that trading conditions remained tough and full benefits of
the cost cutting exercise would not be felt this year.

FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Tace faces fresh clash over choice of
chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL investors are today expected to reopen a campaign to place
their own choice of chairman on the board of Tace, the environmental control
group whose founder, Mr Jock Mackenzie, they ousted last year.
The moves came as shares in the stock rose 12p to 162p in active trading
amid speculation that Mr Bob Morton, the City financier, may be stalking
Tace through Southwind which holds a 4.4 per cent stake.
The institutions, led by Framlington - with a 16 per cent stake - and
Norwich Union - with 5 per cent - are understood to remain deeply
unsatisfied with Sir David Nicolson, who replaced Mr Mackenzie as chairman.
They had favoured Mr Michael Beckett, who joined the board as a director but
quit without explanation last week on the same day that Hoare Govett
resigned as the company's brokers.
The institutions are anxious that a financial restructuring that was
hurriedly announced last Friday should not take place before a full
independent audit into the company's activities and management has been
carried out.
Mr Beckett was also understood to be pushing for the audit. His departure is
thought to have triggered Hoare Govett's after only three weeks as the
company's broker.
It was not clear whether the institutions would be demanding that Mr Beckett
be installed as chairman. Before his resignation he was accused of working
too closely with the institutions and with trying to install his own people.
Sir David said that if he was going to be chairman he would have to be
allowed to run the company without constant interference.
The revolt appears to demonstrate an increasing willingness by institutions
to flex muscles in what they see as cases of poor corporate governance. The
Tace move comes only a day after the removal of Mr John Fletcher, the
chairman of Budgens, following pressure from Electra, IEP and Gartmore.
The proposed capital reorganisation involves Tace buying the 49 per cent of
Goring Kerr, the process control equipment affiliate, which it currently
does not control. It would also involve a rights issue.
Tace said the restructuring would cut overheads and lead to significant tax
savings and improved synergy between the two companies.
Mr Steve Walton, the Tace company secretary, said yesterday that there had
been no discussions with Mr Morton and that there was no sign that Southwind
was behind yesterday's active share dealing.

FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Kwik Save advances 22% and steps up
expansion programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KWIK SAVE, the discount grocery chain, lifted interim pre-tax profits by 22
per cent as it stepped up its aggressive store opening programme.
Mr Graeme Seabrook, chief executive, said there was still plenty of room for
growth in the UK. 'Research indicates that less than 50 per cent of the
population has access to Kwik Save stores,' he said 'We will be opening one
store a week over the next three years.'
In April, the company spent Pounds 26.5m on buying 42 stores in north-east
England from Gateway, 32 of which will be transformed into the Kwik Save
format and the rest into Tates Lateshopper outlets.
The group will also open a further 25 stores before the end of the year
bringing the total number of Kwik Save stores to about 730.
In the 28 weeks to March 9, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 39.51m to
Pounds 48.13m as sales rose strongly from Pounds 785.32m to Pounds 912.71m.
The company said it had benefited from the extension of scanning which now
covers over 90 per cent of sales volumes and is expected to cover all sales
by the year end.
The development of scanning has allowed the company to widen the margins on
grocery products by broadening its product range. However, increased sales
of liquor and tobacco - which have thinner margins than grocery products -
meant that overall gross margins remained static.
The company also announced that it was buying back the Liquorsave
concessions in its stores from Argyll Group. This will give Kwik Save an
additional 240 concessions in its stores to add to its 375 existing Best of
Cellars outlets.
Earnings per share rose by 23 per cent to 20.72p (16.82p). The interim
dividend is lifted by 16 per cent to 4.3p (3.7p).
COMMENT
While the likes of J Sainsbury and Tesco have been slugging it out at the
top of the grocery market, Kwik Save has simply and successfully got on with
the job of consolidating the bottom of the heap. Although its stores may not
look as fancy as those of its giant competitors, the company's financial
attractions are in many ways far greater. Kwik Save's margins are
undoubtedly thin but its asset turnover is considerable enabling it to
achieve the best return on capital in the food retailing sector - at about
35 per cent. Much has been made of the threat posed by the arrival in the UK
of the continental discount operators, Netto and Aldi, but so far the threat
has largely failed to materialise. Together they still have only 25 stores
and appear to have missed some opportunities to expand significantly in
size. Kwik Save itself may look to take advantage of Budgens' current
unfortunate predicament but the company's line is that it is only interested
in an acquisition at the right price - and it does not look as though
Budgens has yet fallen into that range. Assuming pre-tax profits of over
Pounds 103m, the shares on a prospective multiple of 13 are still looking
pretty cheap.

ABERFORTH SPLIT Level Trust (Aslet) is joining the stock market via a
placing and intermediaries offer which will raise Pounds 28.9m after
expenses.
This is the first new issue to use the combination of a placing and
intermediaries offer. James Capel, the trust's sponsor, advertised the
availability of the shares to intermediaries via the Stock Exchange. As a
result, 35 per cent of the offer is being sold via intermediaries, mainly
private client stockbrokers.
The trust, which is managed by Aberforth Partners, will concentrate on
smaller company investments. Up to 15m income and 15m capital shares are
being issued at 100p each.
Income shareholders are entitled to all the income of the company - a
prospective gross dividend yield of 12 per cent - and a repayment of 10p per
share (the par value) if the trust is wound up. Capital shareholders do not
receive any income but are entitled to all the assets after the income
shareholders are repaid.
Aberforth established another smaller companies trust last year called
Ascot, the shares of which have consistently traded at a premium to its net
asset value. Dealings in the new trust's shares are expected to start on May
14.

FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Frogmore scorns Southend's sums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROGMORE ESTATES, the target of a Pounds 130m offer from Southend Property
Holdings, is likely to emphasise the contrasts between the two companies'
gearing and dividend policies when it publishes its defence document at the
end of next week.
Mr Phillip Davies, managing director, said that Southend's description of
its superior financial record in its offer document had used selective
statistics and given an incomplete picture. 'We also have a very good
record. It depends on your starting point,' he said.
Mr Davies said that Southend's emphasis on Frogmore's large overheads bill
relied on out of date figures. Sharp overhead reductions had taken place
since the market turned down, he said.
Southend's bid suffered a setback this week as it lost apparent control of a
block of 10 per cent of Frogmore's shares.
The irrevocable undertaking to accept Southend's offer given by De Zoete &amp;
Bevan ceased to apply when de Zoete declined to purchase the 4m Frogmore
shares over which it held a call option.
Mr Dennis Cope, chairman of Frogmore, criticised Southend for giving the
impression from the outset that it controlled 20 per cent of Frogmore's
shares.
However, Mr Malcolm Dagul, chairman of Southend, said that he was relaxed
about the decision as he had always thought it unlikely that it would get
control of the shares from de Zoete.
The shares have reverted to Markheath Securities, which holds, with its
associates, 17 per cent of Frogmore's shares. The other main Frogmore
shareholders are Equitable Life. London &amp; Manchester and Sun Life.

FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Owen &amp; Robinson seeks Pounds 9m via rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWEN &amp; ROBINSON, the retail jeweller, yesterday announced a 1-for-1 rights
issue to raise Pounds 9m and revive a balance sheet decimated by a
disastrous foray into the property market.
The issue at 35p, just below the closing price of the shares on the market
yesterday, will also finance a rapid expansion of a number of jewellery and
footwear stores.
Owen also reported a Pounds 5.45m provision against losses on the sale of
property companies which it bought in 1989.
In addition it faces a redemption call from a preference shareholder, which
will cost it Pounds 1.7m in July.
The company will have to apply to the High Court to reduce its share premium
account by Pounds 6.69m to allow the resumption of dividend payments in
future years.
If the rights issue is successful, Owen will finish this fiscal year with
gearing of 40 per cent and debt of about Pounds 3.5m, said Mr Tom Forsyth,
finance director.
Owen reported a pre-tax loss in the year to end-January of Pounds 638,000,
compared to a profit of Pounds 1.01m the previous year, on sales up Pounds
4.1m at Pounds 18.14m.
Losses per share came out at 9.29p - compared with earnings of 1.59p - and
the company passed the final dividend leaving a total for the year of 0.15p.
Most of the properties have now been sold for Pounds 4.2m in cash. Owen paid
Pounds 3.2m for the property company which had book assets of Pounds 10m and
debt of Pounds 6.5m.
Mr Maurice Dwek, chairman, said that stripping out the property division,
the retail loss had been reduced from Pounds 754,000 to Pounds 163,000.
Mr Forsyth said the rights issue was not solely designed to rebuild the
balance sheet.
'The provision on property left a horrendous hole in the balance sheet but
now we are buying stores with equity,' he said. By the end of November, Mr
Forsyth said, Owen would have nearly doubled to 70 the number of Gold Centre
stores which sell a limited range of 9 ct gold jewellery at an average sale
price of between Pounds 12 and Pounds 14.
It will also have doubled the Foothold branded footwear stores to 16 by
January, he said.
Mr Forsyth said the rights issue was well supported. Nearly 40 per cent of
the shares being issued will be taken up by directors and large
shareholders. Mr Dwek votes 24 per cent of the Owen shares through trusts
managed by MIM Britannia.
Mr Richard Ratner, a cousin of Mr Gerald Ratner, chairman of Ratners, the
headline-grabbing retail jewellers, resigned yesterday as a director of
Owen.

FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: HMC buys mortgage book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOUSEHOLD Mortgage Corporation has bought the UK mortgage book of
Westpac, the Australian banking group.
No price has been disclosed for the purchase. The Westpac book is worth
about Pounds 175m and boosts HMC's total loan portfolio to more than Pounds
2bn, spread across 40,000 customers.
This is the third purchase of a mortgage book from a smaller lender by HMC,
the third largest UK specialist mortgage company, in the last six months. In
November it took over Chase Manhattan's Pounds 200m book, followed by a
private deal for a second book, also of about Pounds 200m, from an
unidentified lender which wished to withdraw from the market.
Mr Paul Lahiff, Westpac's chief manager, said yesterday that the bank had
decided to exit from the UK home mortgage market because it did not fit well
with the bank's core mortgage business in Europe. He added that he was sure
that HMC would provide good service to Westpac's mortgage customers.
HMC said yesterday that it was considering further purchases of mortgage
books from other lenders. 'This is a good time to buy. There are between 28
and 30 books on the market at present and though a lot of them are poor,
there are some available at good prices,' the company said.

Cakebread Robey &amp; Co, the builders' and timber merchant, lifted pre-tax
profits nearly fourfold from Pounds 74,000 to Pounds 282,000 in the year to
December 31.
Turnover rose almost 9 per cent to Pounds 27.01m (Pounds 24.89m) and gross

Interest charges took almost twice as much as last time at Pounds 365,000.
After a tax charge of Pounds 90,000 (credit Pounds 255,000), and an
extraordinary credit of Pounds 484,000 (nil) - relating to profits from the
disposal of two properties - attributable profits worked through at Pounds
676,000 (Pounds 329,000).
Earnings more than doubled to 11.3p (5.5p) and the final dividend is lifted

FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Waterford Wedgwood loss deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WATERFORD Wedgwood, the Irish group formed by the 1986 merger of the crystal
and china companies, announced pre-tax losses for 1990 of IPounds 21.4m
(Pounds 19.37m), compared to a IPounds 20.6m deficit in the previous year.
In spite of the gloomy figures, the group said that there was a 'significant
improvement' in operations in the second half and that there were now
positive signs of recovery in overall performance. Mr Howard Kilroy,
chairman, said that the group was now 'well positioned to benefit from any
recovery in the economic environment'.
The announcement highlighted the improvement in operating profits in the
second half - up to IPounds 9.7m (IPounds 347,000). Group debt had also been
dramatically reduced from IPounds 125m to IPounds 38m.
The cut in debt was mainly brought about through the IPounds 80m injected
into the company last March by a consortium led by Mr Tony O'Reilly, the
Ireland-born head of the Heinz food conglomerate, and Morgan Stanley, the US
investment bank. The consortium now holds a 30 per cent stake in the
Waterford Wedgwood group.
Mr Bob Davies, group finance director, said that the recent performance of
the company had been encouraging considering the problems caused by the Gulf
war and the consequent downturn in tourism, plus the impact of the weakness
of the dollar. (The US accounts for between 60 and 70 per cent of the
company's total crystal sales and about 15 per cent of its china sales).
There was also an estimated IPounds 10m loss as a result of the 14-week
strike at the Waterford crystal plant in the middle of last year.
'I would express cautious optimism about group performance in the future,'
said Mr Davies, though he conceded that sales had been difficult in the
first quarter of this year. Total sales in 1990 were IPounds 307.9m (IPounds
349.1m). Losses per share emerged at 4.29p (6.56p).
Once again the Wedgwood side performed well but the crystal operation still
made losses. Wedgwood had operating profits of IPounds 17.7m (IPounds
16.3m), while Waterford suffered an operating loss of IPounds 5m (IPounds
21.3m).
The group warned that in spite of new worker agreements at Waterford and
reductions in production costs, further action was still needed before the
crystal division could return to profitability.
Alongside the results, the group also announced that a syndicate of banks -
reported to be led by Bank of Ireland and National Westminster Bank - have
agreed to provide loan facilities of Pounds 105m. It is believed that a
large part of the loan will be invested in the Wedgwood china division.

FLEXELLO Castors &amp; Wheels, the Berkshire-based manufacturer of castors and
trolley wheels, announced that it is in discussions with a third party with
a view to strengthening its financial and commercial position.
The group said that the discussions taking place may or may not lead to an
offer being made for the company.
The shares have moved sharply in the past week, gaining over 20 per cent
from 87p on April 25 to 105p at Wednesday's close. Yesterday they fell to
97p on the news.
Flexello also warned that due to difficult trading conditions results for
the six months to end-March were likely to be significantly worse than those
for the comparable period.
At the previous interim stage Flexello incurred a loss of Pounds 377,895
(profit Pounds 507,987).
In the year to September 30 1990 the deficit was Pounds 497,000 compared
with profits of Pounds 949,000 in 1989. The lapse into losses was due
largely to destocking by its distributors.

FT  03 MAY 91 / CS Holding plunges 78% in 1990

<TEXT>
UP TO 20 per cent of the shares of Credit Suisse, Switzerland's
third-biggest bank, may be sold to the public as part of a wide-ranging
capital-raising exercise by CS Holding, its parent company.
Mr Rainer Gut, CS Holding's chairman, announced the move at the same time as
revealing a fall of 78 per cent in consolidated earnings to SFr192m (Dollars
129.7m) for 1990.
CSH also revealed a Dollars 587m loss last year by its investment banking
subsidiary CS First Boston, into which it had to inject new capital after
the US operations were caught with a Dollars 1bn exposure in doubtful bridge
loans.
CSH owns more than 99 per cent of Credit Suisse. The Swiss bank's shares
were converted into CSH stock when the group adopted a holding company
structure in 1989. This structure has since been challenged by the Federal
Banking Commission.
Analysts had expected an increase in CSH's capitalisation. However, the
re-opening of Credit Suisse stock to the public - which would mean a
relisting of the bank's shares - appeared to be a bold reaction, typical of
CSH's forceful chairman.
Mr Gut said the size, timing and pricing of a Credit Suisse share offer
would depend on market conditions.
Shareholders will be offered a bonus option. Under this, 20 options from
registered or bearer shares will carry an entitlement to subscribe to one
registered or bearer share. The terms will be announced before the annual
meeting on May 22.
CSH is also considering placing subordinated loans up to the 25 per cent
limit allowed by Swiss banking law. The loans would be offered to foreign
investors, Mr Gut said.
CSH parent company net profit for the year ending March 31 fell by SFr135m,
or 29 per cent, to SFr324m. The board proposes to reduce the shareholders'
dividend from SFr110 to SFr75 per bearer share and from SFr22 to SFr15 per
registered share.
CSH's 1990 performance was determined by what Mr Peter Kupfer, executive
board member, called CS First Boston's 'catastrophic' year and the 31 per
cent slide in net earnings and dividend cut at Credit Suisse. The Swiss bank
provides more than 80 per cent of the parent company's dividend income.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Wellcome pre-tax profits up by 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME, the UK pharmaceutical group, yesterday reported a 10 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits for the half year to March 2, in the face of
strongly adverse currency movements.
The Pounds 181m profits for the six months were above market expectations of
Pounds 160m-Pounds 170m and Wellcome shares closed 63p up at 582p.
Operating margins jumped from 21.9 per cent in 1990 to 24.3 per cent this
year. Wellcome said three factors were responsible: reduced costs; a Pounds
5m cut in research and development spending after exceptional growth last
year; and an Pounds 8m reduction in pension costs, following a revaluation
of the UK pension fund.
Mr John Robb, chief executive, said the underlying profits growth was 28 per
cent, after adjusting for currency movements. Because more than 40 per cent
of Wellcome's sales are in the US, the accounts suffered from the weakness
of the dollar this year.
The group's turnover for the period was unchanged from last year, at Pounds
732m. This translates into an 11 per cent sales increase on a constant
currency basis.
The anti-herpes drug Zovirax remains Wellcome's best-selling product. Its
sales rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 208m, with growth particularly strong in
Germany where Wellcome signed a joint marketing agreement with Hoechst last
year.
However, sales of the anti-Aids drug, Retrovir (AZT), fell by 11 per cent to
Pounds 78m. The number of prescriptions for Retrovir is rising steadily, but
patients are taking the drug in increasingly lower doses - often at levels
below those recommended by Wellcome and the medical authorities. Mr Robb
said recent reports from the US suggested that dosage levels were now
stabilising. If so, Retrovir sales would begin to grow again.
The accounts include a Pounds 6m extraordinary charge resulting from a
tampering incident in the US last February, when an unknown person put
cyanide capsules into packages of Wellcome Sudafed decongestant. The
write-off covers costs of recalling Sudafed and advertising to restore
confidence in the product.
Earnings per share for the half year were 13.2p (11.9p). As a sign of
confidence, the board has doubled the interim dividend to 3p.
Since March, the dollar has strengthened and Wellcome's sales volume has
increased. Sir Alistair forecast continued earnings growth for the second
half.

WATERFORD WEDGWOOD, the international luxury crystal and china company, says
it has turned the corner and is on the way to recovery after the
near-disastrous performance of its crystal division in recent years.
The group announced pre-tax losses for last year of IPounds 21.4m (Pounds
19.4m) compared with losses of IPounds 20.6m in 1989. However, it is
encouraged by ahigher operating profits in the second half of 1990 and a
large-scale reduction in debt levels.
Dublin analysts gave a mixed reception to the results. One said it was clear
that 'a disaster was now turning itself around'. But others said the group
still had problems at its crystal division Details, Page 20

FT  03 MAY 91 / Letter: The coalition that will realise a goal of Indian
decentralisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PRITAM SINGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Rogaly's excellent article, 'Passage to India' (April 23), and
David Housego's two field reports from Kashmir (April 22 and 24) highlight
very vividly the problems of over-centralisation in India. Two points,
however, need further elaboration.
First, that the resistance to the centralised Indian state does not come
only from states like Kashmir, Punjab and Nagaland/Mizoram, where Moslems,
Sikhs and Christians respectively are in a minority, but also from many
Hindu-majority states in the non-Hindi-speaking regions like Assam (for
secession), Orissa (the chief minister there threatened secession), Andhra
Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and West Bengal (for greater
autonomy). This phenomenon is a manifestation of the conflict between many
nationalisms in India and a unified Hindi-dominated Indian nationalism
articulated by the Indian centralist state. These non-Hindi nationalist
movements, having remained dormant during the struggle for Indian
independence, are now reasserting their identities. Mr Rogaly's suggestion
that Indians, in order to 'realise their potential', need to not only move
towards confederation but also 'risk that in the end some of them go their
separate ways' is, indeed, very full of insight and bold.
Second, Rajiv Gandhi's coming to power - which in Mr Rogaly's opinion may be
the probable outcome of this month's general election - will not lead to
decentralisation of power because Mr Gandhi's Congress party, reared in the
Nehru political culture of centralisation, is programmatically opposed to
decentralisation. Only a long-term defeat of the Congress by a coalition of
parties representing different nationalisms can possibly realise the goal of
decentralisation.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Letter: Non-executive directors and their role in corporate
governance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALLEN SYKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The recent report of the Institutional Shareholders Committee on the
best practice in the role and duties of directors ('Code urges separation of
company boards' top roles', April 19) is a curious and disappointing paper.
A statement of best practice on an important topic is useful when such
practice represents a satisfactory solution to the problem. When, however,
the best practice cannot begin to remedy the much-publicised basic
weaknesses in British corporate governance, such a paper is particularly
unsatisfactory.
For over two years an important debate has been continuing on the
inadequacies of British corporate governance, most notably in your paper and
The Economist. It has covered the related subjects of short-termism,
excessive takeover activity and absentee shareholders. Much analysis has
occurred and many remedies have been proposed. All this is ignored by the
committee's paper.
Your writers, Richard Waters (April 19) and Barry Riley (April 20) have
already commented penetratingly on some of the paper's paradoxes, and
particularly the shuffling of all responsibility for better corporate
governance on to the already overloaded shoulders of non-executive
directors. (The committee expects to put the burden entirely on such
directors while taking no part in choosing and nominating them]) The
committee only sees them as a combination of nanny and policeman, but at
most this should be a subsidiary role. The best non-executive directors can
make their contribution by helping businesses to expand profitably - their
main role in western Europe. Accordingly, they deserve profit-based
incentives as well as executive directors.
The most serious weakness in British corporate governance is the lack of
committed, knowledgeable long-term owners. The institutions are unwilling to
fulfil this role, preferring the right to chop and change investment
positions at will. It leaves a vacuum in corporate governance no other
entities can fill. This is the prime cause of short-termism. It has reduced
long term corporate returns in Britain below west European levels, and far
below Japanese levels, yet without benefiting the average institution. Their
returns, as Barry Riley reminds us, are lower even than average corporate
returns. Everyone loses.
In sum, we have a system of corporate governance, ownership and finance
inferior to our main European and Far East rivals. Investment institutions
must accept their responsibility for this, and join with industry in finding
effective remedies.
We need fewer institutional shareholders per company, and a knowledgeable
long-term commitment from them. Then, as in western Europe they should
participate in appointing effective, well remunerated non-executive
directors whose main role would be to help companies run profitably. Perhaps
the Institutional Shareholders Committee would address these more relevant
issues in a further paper.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Letter: No benign feelings in the present recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D B ROBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, When, a decade ago, the recession, which particularly hit the building
industry, brought us to our knees, we had no feeling of resentment against
the government. We recognised that draconian measures were necessary to curb
inflation and to alter radically the habits of many years of socialism and
quasi-socialism. It nevertheless took us six years to recover from the
destruction of our infrastructure brought about by that recession.
This time round, we have no such benign feelings towards the government. We
regard the recession as being the result of unforgivable incompetence by the
government.
We have listened with anger to government spokesmen calling for investment
by industry in innovation. What industry is suffering from now is lack of
liquidity resulting from its having made plans for innovation and expansion
when interest rates were in the 7-10 per cent band. Even those rates were
high, but, in the belief then that government could maintain a reasonable
degree of economic stability, the plans were perfectly prudent.
It is not just that by doubling interest rates the cost of borrowing was
doubled, and, more importantly, that even one's most pessimistic sales
forecasts were undermined. What gives us cause for anger is that the
government was clearly unaware of what it was doing and the effect it would
have. Even as late as after Christmas the prime minister was telling us that
there was no recession. When finally he conceded that it existed, it was
described as being 'shallow and short-lived'.
How can industry be expected to plan in the light of such lack of
understanding by government of what constitutes a workable economic
framework?
The Conservatives would now have us believe that, having re-vamped local
government taxation, they are set fair to win another election. I can only
say that I feel disenfranchised. I want no repeat of the socialist
experience, but have lost faith in the government. Indeed, I feel now as I
did when Mr Heath was in power - the Conservatives need a term in
opposition, during which they can do some re-thinking.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Leading Article: A spring of discontent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of another summer of industrial action on Britain's railways
beckons. Exasperation with what passes for normal service on London
Underground and British Rail was one reason why commuters sympathised with
workers during the last outbreak of strikes in the summer of 1989. They
blamed managers rather than workers for the daily assault by overcrowding
and delays.
Two years on, that exasperation has pushed the quality of public services
issue up the political agenda. The prime minister has singled out education
as an area for reform, the health service row rumbles on and Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, the transport secretary, has questioned the expansion of road
transport; railways are finding cautious political favour.
Much of the renewed discontent among rail workers comes down to money.
Unions have rejected a 7 per cent pay offer which British Rail says is the
most it can afford within government financing limits in a recession; it
expects to overspend by Pounds 650m in this financial year. The strife on
London Underground has been prompted by cuts of 1,005 jobs and new working
rosters after the corporation made unexpected losses of Pounds 92m.
There are more complex issues in the background. British Rail is already in
dispute with unions over working patterns. It hopes to obtain seven-day
rostering in return for higher basic pay. London Underground plans more
flexible working for station staff after its Action Stations package fell
victim to the 1989 industrial action.
Neither BR nor London Underground is acting unreasonably in trying to hold
down wages. Both face financial constraints and BR argues that the fall in
the rate of inflation over the coming financial year means a 7 per cent rise
will improve living standards. But rail managers also know that recruitment
difficulties have harmed service, and that they could be exacerbated by
ill-judged settlements.
London Underground's job cuts are more contentious. They may amount to no
more than good housekeeping in response to automated ticket sales, but
passengers can already see the impact of the new rosters in the reduced
opening hours of some ticket offices. This cut in service stems from
financial mismanagement rather than worker intransigence.
BR has learned lessons from its hasty reform attempts of two years ago, and
has been patiently pursuing changes in working patterns. These would improve
service and make BR a more attractive employer. The latest union opposition
looks to be based on the wish of long-serving workers to protect excessive
overtime payments. Management must therefore persist with its case.
The unions need to be wary of pushing their luck by seeking higher pay and
opposing change. Passengers' patience with them is fragile and will become
more so if London Underground and British Rail can put their case better
this time than they did last.
But the employers need to be careful too. The changes they want may be
common practice in private manufacturing, but so too is higher pay. On the
railways as elsewhere, if tight government financial restrictions continue
to render hollow the rhetoric of improved public services, workers will not
be solely to blame for the ensuing public discontent.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Antarctica's frozen future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY A short time ago, it seemed as if the long debate between those who
want to turn Antarctica into a world nature reserve and the proponents of a
regulated exploitation of its potential mineral resources, would never be
resolved. A group of nations, led by Australia and France and convinced that
an environmental disaster would overtake the frozen continent if it were
opened to mineral exploitation, insisted that the 39 signatories of the 1961
Antarctica treaty should impose a permanent ban on mining. Others, such as
Britain, Japan and the US, considered it was wrong to commit future
generations to policies which might no longer be appropriate in a very
different economic, political and environmental context.
Yet after the latest conference of member countries in Madrid, it suddenly
looks as if a compromise on this contentious issue is in the offing. All the
member countries realised, after the deadlock reached at their previous
meeting in Chile last November, that the necessary consensus for decisions
could be achieved only if they abandoned their entrenched positions. The
proposed 50-year moratorium on mining prospection and exploitation offers a
politically acceptable way out of the impasse, though it appears to favour
the environmentalists more than the mining lobby.
Britain, the US and Japan have always argued that their main objection to
the Franco-Australian position was that it involved a permanent ban on
mining activities. They made it clear that, if the new arrangements allowed
the exploitation of Antarctica's mineral wealth in the long run, that would
be acceptable, given an agreement on the duration of the ban. Yet it appears
that the moratorium, in the compromise proposed by Norway and Spain, would
be virtually open-ended. It would remain in effect even after the expiry of
the 50-year period, unless a 75 per cent majority of the treaty's
consultative members decided otherwise, an unrealistic prospect.
Whether such a long moratorium is in the best interests of the international
community remains a moot point. Certainly, in a world increasingly subject
to environmental disasters, ranging from the explosion at the Chernobyl
nuclear power station to the horrific oil fires of Kuwait, it is tempting to
embrace the idea that an environmental safe haven can be created somewhere
on this scarred planet.
Yet the arguments on the other side should not be minimised. Though no
valuable mineral deposits have yet been discovered on the continent,
Antarctica's coastal shelf is estimated to contain substantial oil
resources. These might be sorely needed in the event of a future world oil
shortage, either as the result of depletion of existing reserves or military
conflicts in traditional oil-producing regions.
Rather than opting for the extreme course of taking an area equivalent to
one-tenth of the world's land and sea surface out of economic circulation
for 50 years or more, it would be better to search for an intermediate
solution. A shorter moratorium of perhaps 20 to 30 years would allow
sufficient time for international regulations to be worked out to ensure
that mineral extraction, when and if it eventually takes place, is conducted
within generally accepted environmental norms. It is unfortunate that the
consensus required by the Antarctica treaty appears virtually to have ruled
out such a solution.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Arts: Toronto Symphony Orchestra - Barbican Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So many visiting orchestras have brought us Brahms symphonies recently. It
hardly seems worth an orchestra crossing the Atlantic to give us another,
but the Toronto Symphony Orchestra is not the kind to make the journey for
nothing, to judge from this determined showing.
The orchestra's tour has taken in London and Glasgow. At the Barbican on
Wednesday it offered what might have looked a dour programme. A new work by
Raymond Luedeke and Bartok's Viola Concerto did not exactly make a festive
start for a concert in the presence of royalty. But there were compensations
and it is not meant as a slight on the orchestra to say that the outstanding
feature up until the interval was the playing of the soloist, Yury Bashmet.
The Bartok concerto is a late piece, which refuses to give up its true
feelings easily in what seems a hostile musical environment. Bashmet played
it supremely well, not only making sure that the viola was always the prime
mover in the orchestral texture, but also voicing his part with a marvellous
freedom and spontaneity. The opening of the slow movement can rarely have
been so hauntingly sad.
This was the 'difficult' modern music on the programme, not the Luedeke. The
North Wind's Gift is an orchestral piece lasting about 10 minutes, the token
example of new work from its own country that many a visiting orchestra
brings, well crafted, but quite unmemorable as to its content. The music
felt like the accompaniment to something more important and it was no
surprise to read that it is taken from an opera in progress.
And so to Brahms's First Symphony. Gunther Herbig has been Music Director in
Toronto more or less since Andrew Davis left in 1988 and he is evidently
shaping his orchestra into a fine vehicle for the German classics. The
Toronto players gave us Brahms with none of the spurious heaviness of the
Oslo Philharmonic a few weeks ago; they made wind and brass parts engage
with a vigour missed by the Leipzig Gewandhaus last autumn.
Everything was well balanced, purposeful, warm enough in sound. For his part
Herbig did nothing untoward or exaggerated, but brought to a central,
Germanic style of performance just the combination of urgency and passion
that so miserably eluded Giulini recently in the Festival Hall. This was a
Brahms First Symphony some way above the average. Well worth the journey, in
fact.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Arts: Chicago-Tashkent - The Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Place is once again playing host to a season of what can conveniently
but optimistically be called 'new dance'. With financial sponsorship from
Holsten Pils, experimentalists from seven European countries are being given
a London show-case during the next three weeks. Very laudable, but it would
be a brave soul who believed that everything on offer was of merit. There is
good avant-garde dance in Europe, and The Place has earned our respect for
bringing us an artist as gifted as Belgium's Wim Vanderkeybus, and the
magical illusion from the Dutch Dans Produktie. (It has earned something
rather different for its obsession with the higher pretentiousness of what
passes for modern dance in France.)
The problem is that for every one group where choreographic skill and
technical prowess match creative vision, there are half a dozen miscreants
whose efforts are banal, predictable and self-indulgent. In this bran-tub
the critic dips warily, and Alastair Macaulay and I have reported here on
numbing evenings at The Place, where the chiming of the nearby church clock
(how can a quarter of an hour last so long?) sounds in the auditorium like a
death-knell to any hope of escape.
The bells were faintly discernible on Wednesday night above the miserable
racket of drumming that was the accompaniment to Chicago-Tashkent, an
offering from the Munich-based Dance Energy troupe, which was making a
British debut. The idea behind Micha Purucker's 75 minute piece was a
journey from high-energy (typified by Chicago) to some relative calm,
associated with Tashkent. The premise was dubious; the visualisation
depressing. Seven dancers rushed about and indulged in those grapplings and
falls that are the commonplace of student efforts at what is merrily called
'choreography'.
They were animated for Chicago; less so for Tashkent. Various other
incidents - a bit of a puppet show; a mysterious observer in head-scarf and
mad waterproof - served to decorate the issue. The accompaniment (by Robert
Merdzo) was monotonous bangings; the clothes were a rag-bag of Oxfam
cast-offs. The movement idiom was limited, and herein lies the flaw in so
much of the experiment we are subjected to by well-intentioned but
undiscriminating presenters like The Place. Far too much of current new wave
choreography is unsustained by any compositional skill: ideas are blocked
and frustrated in expression because no adequate technique has been acquired
to speak of a theme. Cliche rules, and the most striking thing about such an
evening is the inability of the dance to do its task.

<TEXT>
Though Friday is not the best night for the enthusiastic viewer, this
evening's early movie on BBC2 is a good one: The Crimson Pirate (6.00). The
word 'swashbuckling' might have been invented for it. Burt Lancaster employs
all the skills mastered in his early career as a circus acrobat, and
delivers lines such as 'I'll fly my flag into the mouths of their cannon and
if you've crimson in your veins you'll follow me' with that clenched teeth
grin that became his trademark.
Then ITV begins a new sitcom called Second Thoughts (8.00) which may be
good, you never know; it does have former Likely Lad James Bolam in it and
also Lynda Bellingham. However, we are told 'Divorcees Bill and Faith are
moving in together but her teenage children and his ex wife are not making
it easy'. Perhaps that makes your heart skip. It makes mine sink.
The Chief (9.00 ITV) sustains a fairly impressive standard of production,
even if it is not the most subtle or surprising police series. The plot is
now much concerned with 'community policing' and in today's story Stafford
appeals to the residents of a rundown estate for help in catching those who
have killed a police officer.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Management (Corporate Strategy): ICI goes native in the land
of the long-term - The UK group's investment in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost every day, it seems, one Japanese company or another announces that
it is setting up a factory or development centre in Europe or America.
Although the reverse process has had less publicity, western companies are
in fact pouring many billions of yen into new manufacturing and research
facilities in Japan.
One of the most striking examples is ICI, Britain's largest manufacturer.
ICI was slower to move into Japan than other international chemicals groups;
four years ago its Japanese activities were limited to importing chemicals
and participating in joint ventures with local companies.
Today, after a Pounds 100m investment spree, ICI is the 100 per cent owner
of two new factories (one making polyester film and the other
pharmaceuticals) and two research centres (one for specialist chemicals and
new materials and the other for agrochemicals).
Land, labour and materials are so expensive in Japan that these investments
will not pay for themselves for several years. The ICI board accepted that
the Pounds 50m plant to produce Melinex polyester film, opened last October,
would give a significantly lower rate of return, looked at in isolation,
than adding to existing production capacity in Europe or the US.
But the strategy being pursued by ICI is not just about selling more goods
in Japan. It is also - and perhaps more importantly - about hitching its
fortunes firmly to the global expansion of Japan's end-user industries,
especially automobiles and electronics.
Only by doing research and manufacturing in Japan can ICI effectively
develop special chemicals and materials in collaboration with the giant car
companies such as Toyota and Honda and electronics companies such as
Matsushita and Sony. The idea is that ICI will then be able to sell these
products to Japanese-owned car and electronics plants around the world - and
at the same time will gain competitive advantage in selling similar products
to the remaining European and American car and electronics manufacturers.
Japanese companies prefer to collaborate with chemicals suppliers which have
scientists and engineers in Japan and a factory to produce material locally.
For example, ICI has already lost the strong position it had 10 years ago as
a supplier of plastic film to manufacturers of magnetic recording media
(tape and discs) because the company was not in Japan then. 'We missed out
on the Japanese electronic media revolution of the 1980s,' says Richard
Sykes, the ICI Japan director responsible for the Melinex project.
The relative weakness and fragmentation of Japan's indigenous chemical
industry makes it easier for foreign chemical groups to expand there. The
largest Japanese chemical companies, Mitsubishi Kasei and Asahi Chemical,
are only one third the size of ICI, and chemicals are one of the few
manufacturing sectors in which Japan runs a trade deficit. Although a few
important chemical innovations have come out of Japan, the industry's
scientific and technological base is generally weak by western standards.
One important reason for this is that the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (MITI), which has done so much behind the scenes to help other
industries organise their assault on world markets while protecting their
home base, does not take such an active interest in chemicals. 'At the end
of the day MITI is going to favour the automotive and electronics industries
rather than the chemical industry,' says Masinori Kato, ICI's Osaka branch
manager.
Even so, no foreign company ever finds it easy to establish itself in Japan.
In a country of full employment, where social attitudes still favour working
for a Japanese employer, staff recruitment can be extremely difficult. A
company expanding into Japan from abroad cannot rely solely on the
traditional recruitment policy of taking on university graduates who will
stay with it for life.
ICI has persuaded senior people to move to it in mid-career, by offering a
combination of higher salary, more time off work and a more interesting or
responsible job.
To help recruitment, particularly of new graduates, ICI has successfully
trod the path many foreign companies have followed of taking on 'senior
advisers' who have retired recently as managers of well-known Japanese
companies. 'One of their most important roles is to bring us contacts with
university professors who then refer their good students to ICI,' says John
Wilson, a New Zealander who runs ICI Japan's agrochemicals division.
'Personal recommendations by good university professors are the best source
of the best graduates.'
The highest ranking adviser is Shoichi Saba, former chairman of Toshiba, the
electronics giant, who served on ICI's main board as a non-executive
director from 1985 until February. Saba, now aged 72, is still a powerful
voice in Japanese government and business circles as vice-chairman of the
Keidanren (Federation of Economic Organisations), and he has done more than
any other individual to raise ICI's corporate profile in Japan.
On a personal level, Saba persuaded his former colleague Mikio Kurashima,
who had been head of Toshiba America, to join ICI Japan as executive
director responsible for personnel, planning, business development and
public relations. (John Russell, president of ICI Japan, heads a team of six
directors: three expatriate Britons and three Japanese.)
Kurashima says that, of all the differences between working for Toshiba and
ICI, language is the biggest. 'To put it simply: in Toshiba they work in
Japanese, in ICI they work in English. Japanese employees of ICI do talk in
Japanese when they're by themselves, but if there's a single Englishman
present - as there normally will be in a large meeting - the meeting will
have to take place in English.'
Looking at the language gap from the English side, Jim Armstrong, head of
ICI Pharmaceuticals in Japan, says: 'There are two languages you have to
learn in Japan: Japanese and Japanese English. It's surprising how often the
Japanese staff do not really understand the messages of letters arriving
here (from the UK). There's a whole series of English words that have a
particular meaning to the Japanese, which is different from the common
English usage.'
Apart from personnel and recruitment problems, western companies find it
more difficult than they would at home to get permission to build a factory
or research centre. In a densely populated country where land and labour are
very scarce, the prospect of creating jobs is no incentive for allowing
industrial development.
ICI executives have devoted a lot of time and effort to cultivating local
government officials in Ibaraki prefecture, north-east of Tokyo, where the
company has built the Melinex film plant, Japan Technical Centre and
Agricultural Research Station.
The pattern of land ownership in Japan is another complicating factor.
Although the Agricultural Research Station covers only eight hectares, ICI
had to negotiate with 38 separate landowners to buy the patchwork of paddy
fields it needed.
To help managers cultivate business contacts, ICI Japan has corporate
membership in three golf clubs. 'This pays off in terms of establishing
human relationships,' says John Wilson. 'Golf is not seen as competitive in
Japan but an enjoyable day out.'
Foreign businesses in Japan need to build up a relationship not only with
customers but also with suppliers. Given the strength of the Japanese
machine tool and electronics industries, it is surprising at first sight
that ICI imported two-thirds of the equipment for the new Melinex plant from
Germany, including the Siemens computerised control system. 'We originally
hoped to use more Japanese equipment but we discovered that to buy from the
Japanese we needed a longer-term relationship,' says a British engineer on
the Melinex project.
As polyester film begins to roll off the Melinex production lines, ICI's
Japanese staff are already lobbying hard for the group to allocate
substantial new funds to keep up the momentum of investment in Japan during
the 1990s. For example Toshiaki Harada, a manager in the Japan Technical
Centre, says: 'We think ICI's paints division should come to Japan.' He
argues that the future of its automotive paints business depends on building
a relationship with the Japanese car manufacturers.
But the next large-scale investment is most likely to be in
chlorofluoro-carbon substitutes. Japanese refrigerator and air conditioner
manufacturers will be extremely important customers for the Klea 134a, a
replacement for ozone-destroying CFC refrigerants. Scientists and engineers
at the Technical Centre are already working with Japanese customers on this;
a Klea factory in Japan would cost at least Pounds 75m and would open in the
mid-1990s.
With ICI cutting capital expenditure, however, in response to the current
downturn in the chemical industry, Sir Denys Henderson, the chairman, says
the board could not sanction a Klea plant for Japan until the US plant
(under construction) and in the UK have proved themselves.
Even so, Henderson emphasises that Japan - and the whole Asia Pacific region
 -will continue to receive high priority for investment. The medium-term
target is to double ICI's sales in Japan from Pounds 500m last year to
Pounds 1bn in 1995.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Technology: Barriers to British innovation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British companies are prevented from getting innovative products to market
due to a lack of skilled managers, a lack of knowledge of the marketplace
and an ignorance of what the customer wants, according to a new study by
consultants Arthur D Little.
The Product Innovation Survey paints a stark picture of Britain's innovative
capacity. The greatest concern for companies, the study reports, is getting
a new product to market on time - 80 per cent of respondents said this was
of concern.
By comparison only 40 per cent said that reducing the costs of developing
new products was a priority. And only 56 per cent said that improving the
appeal of new products was an area where they were applying more effort.
Conducted as part of a worldwide research project on product innovation,
which will be available in about two months, the Arthur D Little survey
questioned 70 of Britain's most innovative organisations. Most were
manufacturers and about 90 per cent of them had turnovers of more than
Pounds 100m.
The questionnaires were completed by the chief executive or the technical
director of the company, which, says Peter Scott-Morgan, associate director
of Arthur D Little, is one positive indicator from the survey. 'There is a
growing belief that the way you cope is through innovation,' he says.
More negative were the measures used by companies to assess whether they
were meeting their product development objectives. Some 86 per cent said
sales volumes were important while 83 per cent rated profitability. Product
quality only scored 48 per cent on the product development objective scale.
But perhaps the most telling indicator was when the companies were given a
list of 32 potential obstacles to innovation. Those that hindered innovation
most were the lack of skilled managers and lack of knowledge about the
marketplace, customers' and rivals.

ISRAELI researchers, in experiments on mice, have isolated a peptide which
can prevent the onset of diabetes and which might provide the basis for an
early diagnostic test and vaccine against the illness in humans.
In auto - immune diseases the immune system's 'T' cells, which are supposed
to fight disease, attack the body's own cells when they recognise a
particular peptide (a segment of protein). In the case of diabetes these are
the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas.
Researchers at the Weizmann Institute, in Rehovot, have found that by
isolating the appropriate peptide, and by giving extra doses of it to the
mice, the autoimmune attack could be aborted. The peptide is synthesised
from a protein which is present in human beings.

CLOTHES which can change colour according to your mood is the promise of a
liquid crystal display technology developed in Poole, UK, by a division of
the German chemicals company Merck, of Darmstadt.
The technique uses liquid crystal ink, originally developed for use in
equipment such as thermometers, which is sensitive to heat and changes
colour as the temperature rises - from black to red, yellow, green, blue and
violet. It achieves this because the heat changes the viscosity of the
liquid crystal ink, and so the light reflected.
The task for Merck, which worked on the technology with Hull University and
the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment at Malvern, has been to develop an
ink which can be applied to textiles and survive washing or cleaning. This
has been achieved by combining the inks with a type of gelatin. A special
screen varnish can also be applied over the top.

IT'S all very well to have the latest grapical user interface on your
personal computer, but if you are extracting data from a mainframe which has
less sophisticated presentation standards the data cannot be displayed in
the same way.
To try and overcome this kind of problem, KPMG Management Consulting, of
London, is launching a service which aims to bring together corporate
information and display it on the PC in the way each user wants.
KPMG is setting up a showcase demonstration in its own offices of its ISD
(integrating services at the desktop) concept.
As well as putting together hardware and software from a number of vendors,
KPMG will be developing agentware - software which translates data coming
into the PC so that it is in the format the user wants - rather then the way
that it was written.
According to KPMG the business advantages of ISD outweigh the costs:
organisations can expect pay-offs of three to four times their investment
through proper desk-top integration, according to KPMG research.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Technology: Rewards of friendship - Why AT&amp;T and NEC are
joining forces to produce the next generation of semiconductors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When AT&amp;T Microelectronics and NEC, the Japanese electronics company, were
calculating the potential savings to be made in jointly developing
technology to make future generations of semiconductors, they had to allow
for one extra cost - translation services.
The two companies have just agreed to develop a process for further
semiconductor miniaturisation, thus increasing the memory capacity and
functions of an individual chip, though the success of the project will
depend as much on human relations as on the sophistication of their
respective technologies.
Apart from saving money in the expensive race to develop ever more
sophisticated chips, the agreement reflects the emphasis placed by Japanese
electronics companies on cultivating strategic relationships with foreign
companies.
Close ties with AT&amp;T could bring NEC benefits not only in semiconductors, a
constant source of trade friction with the US, but also in the
telecommunications market, where trade disputes are also a problem.
The companies' announcement last week flowed from an agreement last year on
the development of application-specific integrated circuits (Asics) and came
a few days after the finalisation of a pact between Toshiba and the General
Electric Company of the US. Those two companies have agreed on the marketing
of humble home appliances and, more importantly, to launch research projects
in refrigeration technology, electronic controls and environment-related
technologies.
Chip partnerships have become commonplace between US and Japanese companies,
despite the ongoing disputes over access to the Japanese market. There are
tie-ups between NMB Semiconductor and Intel, Toshiba and Motorola, Sony and
Advanced Micro Devices, Matsushita and Intel, and Hitachi and Texas
Instruments (TI).
In February, Hitachi and TI announced that their 1988 pact had produced a
protective package for a 16Mbit dynamic random access memory (D-Ram) chip.
Their relationship is for the most part an exchange of information, which a
TI official in Japan said is 'working well', while the AT&amp;T and NEC
agreement is far more ambitious, involving exchanges of researchers and
joint funding of a project with broad applications.
Electronics companies are competing to cram increasing amounts of memory and
functions on to chips, meaning that they have to find ways to shrink the
circuits. Companies are now swinging into mass production of 4Mbit D-Ram
chips, and have begun to deliver samples of 16Mbit chips, but will need to
improve significantly manufacturing processes to market 64Mbit chips
successfully.
The development of 16Mbit chips is proceeding with 0.5-micron technology,
enabling circuits to be produced with a width of 0.5-microns (a micron is a
millionth of a metre). AT&amp;T and NEC have agreed to develop a 0.35-micron
process, which is regarded as essential for the mass production of future
chip generations.
Officials at AT&amp;T say the company presently has a 0.9-micron capability and
the tie-up with NEC will allow a matching of the company's strengths in
basic research with the chip technology skills of NEC, which has been the
leading Japanese producer.
Japanese companies complain that the costs of keeping ahead in the memory
race are multiplying faster than chip capacities, and the pressure of
competition is forcing the introduction of chips such as the 16Mbit D-Ram
even before the 4Mbit market has matured.
William Warwick, president of AT&amp;T Microelectronics, said that developing
the 0.35-micron process is likely to cost between Dollars 400m and Dollars
500m: 'I don't think that the agreement will save us half of those costs,
but it will be more than a quarter.'
The benefits of the partnership, he said, would be to 'share resources,
lower individual company risks, and gain timely access to technology'.
Tomihiro Matsumura, NEC's executive vice-president, said that the agreement
'represents true co-operation between two multinational semiconductor
companies'.
Precise details of that co-operation are yet to be finalised, but the
companies have agreed to divide the development process into 'modules', with
scientists at NEC and AT&amp;T working on agreed technology problems in their
respective laboratories in Japan and the US.
It is expected that there will be from 25 to 29 modules, and each company
will send a researcher to the other to monitor each module and ensure that
appropriate information is exchanged during the two-year programme. AT&amp;T and
NEC have agreed to report regularly on progress, and say that they are clear
in their own minds about the status of ownership rights - if a patent
follows joint work it will be jointly owned.
Research work will be conducted by the development division of AT&amp;T Bell
Laboratories and the chip development department of NEC, and will focus on
areas such as memory cell technology, ultra-fine circuiting technology and
ultra-fine etching technology.
If the project is successful, the two companies will have a common
0.35-micron technology and will be able to develop related products and,
perhaps, to share production lines to increase their manufacturing
flexibility.
'Our combined efforts will assure our customers timely access to a
leading-edge process technology that will be used to design sophisticated
components that will enhance the value and performance of our customers' end
systems,' Warwick suggested.
The sensitivity of the US-Japan relationship in electronics prompted AT&amp;T to
emphasise that the NEC partnership will not comprise the US company's
commitment to Sematech - the Texas-based US government-industry project
which had planned to develop 0.35-micron technology by 1993, but has fallen
behind schedule.
'AT&amp;T has supported Sematech since its inception and remains committed to
the efforts taking place at Sematech to assist the US semiconductor
industry,' Warwick said.
Steve Myers, senior industrial electronics analyst at Jardine Fleming, said
that the success of the joint research project will depend on
middle-management's interpretation of the aims of the executives who signed
the agreement.
'It requires very sophisticated management direction. The middle-level has
to understand exactly what they are supposed to be doing,' Myers said.
He said the agreement was useful for NEC, which has found the financial
commitments of advanced research a difficult burden, and would assist AT&amp;T,
which he said has not fulfilled its potential in chip marketing.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Management: Inadequate today, disastrous tomorrow -
Organisational structures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since Peter Drucker let fly three years ago with a much-quoted article on
The Coming of the New Organisation, managers have been subjected to a
growing barrage of warnings from gurus and consultants that their
organisations will have to change character dramatically if they are to
survive far beyond the turn of the century.
At present, the argument runs, most organisations respond ineffectively to
today's competitive pressures because they are too hierarchical, too costly,
too slow to adapt, too unresponsive to customers, too demotivating to
employees, and altogether too limited in creativity and initiative. What is
merely inadequate today will become downright disastrous tomorrow.
To Drucker, Tom Peters, Charles Handy, and others, the ideal organisations
of the near future will be flat, flexible, and 'knowledge-based' - peopled
heavily by skilled professionals, in the widest sense.
Hence their citation of unlikely-looking models: Drucker favours orchestras
and hospitals (presumably the American, rather than the British variety),
while Peters and Handy tend to go for fast-moving TV stations such as CNN,
together with a handful of well-run management consultancies and other
professional service firms. To people who work in them, such organisations
may seem chaotic, but many do achieve their corporate objectives very
effectively.
Though a growing body of managers in all sorts of com panies and industries
does perceive the need for change, many executives find such examples either
daunting or unconvincing. So they will take heart from the claim that they
can, after all, discover the organisation of the future closer to home: in
the factories and financial operations departments of apparently
conventional organisations.
Writing in the latest issue of the McKinsey Quarterly, Steve Dichter, the
leader of the consultancy's organisation performance practice, argues that
radically new organisational principles are needed now.
He cites as a model a US General Electric factory making electrical circuit
breakers which now has only three levels of employee: 'associate' (shop
floor), advisor, and plant manager. The 'associates' are organised into
self-managing teams which perform traditional staff functions, such as
planning, capital investment requests, and recruitment. Elected facilitators
lead problem-solving teams, and cross-functional committees of 'associates'
meet weekly to deal with policy issues. Instant plant performance data is
available.
Since the early 1980s, over 400 units across a wide range of industries in
the US have been converted to this sort of approach; and the approach has
started to appear in Europe, reports Dichter.
Drawing on these examples, he promulgates a common set of characteristics
for what he calls, 'the organisation of the 1990s'. More akin to some of the
basic tenets of total quality management than he admits, they all contradict
sharply the 'command control' principles which have dominated western
corporate organisation since the early 1900s.
Hierarchy
To managers worried that such characteristics will not only undermine their
control, but diminish individual accountability and remove all hierarchy,
Dichter has a message designed to reassure: that a new, more effective type
of 'committed' control is created; that team and individual accountability
are enhanced; and that 'hierarchy remains as a very important dimension of
every organisation . . . they will continue to have a series of management
layers'.
The nine actions which Dichter says should be taken in order to create such
organisations are rather pedestrian compared with much of the other
available literature on the management of change.
More questionable, however, is whether, as Dichter claims, his ideal
organisation fully matches up to his criteria of being 'borderless,
networked, inverted, empowered, and non-hierarchical'. If not, then the
well-managed 'professional service' organisation may be a more sustainable,
if less comfortable, model after all.

DIRECTORS of a company compulsorily wound up in February yesterday cleared
the legal ground for an appeal against an order that they should pay part of
the legal costs of the case.
Mr Justice Harman ordered the winding up of Land and Property Trust Co on
the petition of John Lelliott Management, creditor for Pounds 6.6m.
He refused leave to appeal against his costs order. But yesterday the
directors, who were not personally parties to the winding-up proceedings,
won an Appeal Court ruling that they do not need leave to launch such an

FT  03 MAY 91 / TV transmission network will be sold by tender
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is to become the first country to privatise part of its television
transmission network, with the sale by tender of National
Transcommunications Ltd, formerly the Independent Broadcasting Authority's
engineering division.
City analysts believe the sale of NTL, which this year expects to make
pre-tax profit of about Pounds 9m on sales of Pounds 77m, may raise between
Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m.
NTL is expected to become one of the first new entrants into the UK's
liberalised telecommunications market. It is already in detailed
negotiations with the Office of Telecommunications, the industry regulator,
over a licence to use its network to transmit television, data and telephone
services.
It is thought likely that NTL might form alliances with groups such as cable
television operators seeking to take advantage of the government's recent
decision to end the telecommunications duopoly held by BT and Mercury.
Mr Peter Lloyd, the broadcasting minister, said bidders were expected to
include foreign telecommunications and television groups. The privatisation
is due in 1996.
Price Waterhouse, the government's lead financial adviser on the sale, said
it had already received inquiries from between 30 and 40 foreign and UK
companies.
The company operates about 475 transmitting sites and has access to a
further 475 run by the BBC.
NTL's main business is transmitting for the ITV independent television
companies, Channel 4, the Welsh fourth channel S4C, and 50 independent local
radio stations. This will this year generate Pounds 61m, of NTL's revenues.
Dr John Forrest, the company's executive chairman, forecast that within the
next few years a third of NTL's income might come from new business
activities, transmitting for television's planned Channel 5 and local
independent radio contractors, as well as video conferencing, data
transmission and telephony services to businesses.
NTL's management favours a bid from a consortium that would include a 15 per
cent stake for the company's 770 employees as well as bringing it access to
European markets.
Television South West, the ITV contractor for the west country, is backing
the Channel Three Wales and the West consortium, bidding for the commercial
television franchise held by HTV covering Wales and the west. TSW is joined
in the consortium by a number of institutional investors.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Lords reject random breath tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PARLIAMENTARY campaign in favour of random breath testing to help cut
down on drink-driving suffered a setback yesterday when the House of Lords
rejected an amendment which would have introduced the new arrangements,
Alison Smith writes.
Instead, in a debate on the first day of the committee stage of the road
traffic bill, a majority of peers supported the government and voted against
the change by 87 to 41, a margin of 46.
The government has consistently said that the problem can be adequately
dealt with through the combination of the existing powers of the police both
to stop drivers for a wide range of motoring offences, and to administer
breath tests where they had reason to believe the driver was under the
influence of alcohol.
The change was proposed by Lord Clinton-Davis, an opposition transport
spokesman, who argued that it would provide an additional, effective
deterrent to drink-driving offences.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Sharing power in a bid to save
electricity - Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ALLIANCE of Unionists and nationalists opposing the sale of Northern
Ireland's electricity industry yesterday left the government rebuffing
exactly the kind of co-operation it seeks in historic talks on the
province's future.
As Unionists prepared to join today the process of round-table talks taking
place in Belfast, Mr Richard Needham, the province's economy minister, stuck
by the Northern Ireland's Office plans to split the electricity utility in
preparation for privatisation.
His intransigence came despite pleas for a re-think in order to foster the
co-operation ministers hope will see a new devolved government in the
province and a replacement Anglo-Irish agreement.
As if to tempt participants in the round-table talks, Mr Needham said that,
if a new administration for the province was set up this summer, locally
elected politicians would be able to reverse his decision.
Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, last night called
for privatisation plans to be shelved while round-table talks continued.
Before 'direct rule' in 1972, energy policy had been in the control of the
Northern Ireland administration, he said.
Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, today meets Mr James Molyneaux
and the Rev Ian Paisley, leaders of the main Unionist parties, for what
could be the last of his bilateral meetings before full round-table
discussions start - probably next Tuesday.
Mr Molyneaux and Mr Paisley have joined forces with Mr John Hume, leader of
the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, to ask for a meeting
with Mr John Major to discuss Northern Ireland electricity.
At question time yesterday, Mr Hume drew parallels between the co-operation
over the electricity industry and hopes for political progress. He urged Mr
Needham to 'reconsider your position'.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Council Elections: Quest for clues to general election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRATEGISTS from the main political parties were preparing early today for a
deep analysis of the results of yesterday's local council elections to
assess the prospects for an early general election.
Polling in 369 local authorities in all parts of the country apart from
Scotland, Northern Ireland and greater London provided the most important
test of the post-Thatcher Tory party and the last big test before a decision
on election timing must be made.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, together with Mr Chris Patten,
Conservative party chairman and his advisers, will be examining the results
to see whether June remains an option or whether a date in the autumn or
next year is now inevitable.
Apart from Mr Major's own standing, the polls were regarded as a crucial
test for the proposed council tax. Ministers were anxious to discover
whether the plan for a property-based local tax had received general
approval and had therefore managed to kill local government finance as an
issue damaging to the government's electoral prospects.
Party analysts were particularly keen to study results from three areas  -
the north-west, the west and the east Midlands - where the next election
might be won or lost. Each area has a high proportion of Tory-held
marginals.
Among the councils that Labour had to capture if it is to have any chance of
winning the next election were Nottingham City, where the two main parties
were level-pegging, with the balance of power held by a Green party member;
West Lancashire District, where the Tories were defending a majority of one;
and Derby City, where the Conservatives were also battling to retain power.
At Gravesham Borough Council in Kent, often regarded as a seat that tends to
reflect the parties' national standing, Conservatives and Labour were
neck-and-neck, with the casting vote in the hands of the Conservative mayor.
Although most of the 28,500 candidates contesting the 12,255 seats at stake
accepted that many voters regarded the elections as a dry run for a general
election, local issues may have proved decisive in many areas.
The Liberal Democrats, more than any other party, have concentrated their
resources on local issues and were hoping to repeat the previous pattern of
doing much better in local elections than their national opinion poll
standing would suggest.
Gateway to the future: votes cast in Park ward in Nottingham may help to
decide the date of the general election
Decision-making process: a vote goes into the box
People power: a voter leaves the polling station
Voters make a mark in Woking in Surrey: the poll tax crisis in the UK has
prompted new interest in local politics

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY and Algeria yesterday signed a package of loans worth Dollars 7bn.
This package is in the context of Italy's decision virtually to double the
amount of natural gas it will buy from Algeria over the next five years.
In addition, the loans are meant as a gesture towards north Africa's largest
country which is engaged in bold reforms aimed at liberalising its political
and economic system. They contrast sharply with the more reserved attitude
of Algeria's main trading partner, France.
The deal will help Algeria's Central Bank which has been sparing no effort
to lengthen the average maturity of the country's Dollars 25.3bn foreign
debt which had declined to just over three years by 1990, thus pushing up
the debt service ratio as a percentage of foreign debt to about 75 per cent.
A first tranche of Dollars 2.5bn is earmarked for the refinancing of credits
over the next seven years. Many of these are guaranteed by the Italian state
and fall due between January 1991 and January 1993.
The remaining Dollars 4.5bn, which will have to be raised through banks,
will be spent on the purchase of Italian goods and services.

LUCAS, the international engineering group based in the West Midlands of the
UK, has extended its penetration of the US defence market with a contract to
supply harpoon missile capsules worth at least Pounds 25m over the next five
years.
The defence fabrications division of Lucas Aerospace won the contract from
McDonnell Douglas Missile Systems. It becomes the sole supplier of the
capsules. Previously it had provided a portion of McDonnell Douglas's needs.
The capsule, which contains electronic recording and monitoring devices,
protects a missile as it launched from a submarine and is jettisoned once
the missile breaks through the surface of the water.
Work on the contract will be done at the Lucas Aerospace plant in Burnley,
Lancashire. The company is the biggest employer in the town, but has been
reducing the size of its workforce because of the recession.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Bulgaria tunes in to the voice of America: US influence is
growing, particularly among opposition groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGARDLESS of the time of day or night, visitors to Sofia, the capital of
Bulgaria, will be struck by an English-language radio station which
broadcasts a predictable menu of pop music and brief news items round the
clock.
This station is not one of the new genre set up by young, up-and-coming
Bulgarians. It is the Voice of America, the US government-backed station
which was recently allowed by the Bulgarian government to broadcast on
Sofia's airwaves.
The presence of this American radio station in Bulgaria, a country once
regarded as Moscow's most loyal ally, is by no means an isolated example of
the growing US interest in this small Balkan country of 8.9m people.
Indeed, the opposition Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), a loose alliance of
19 political movements, has forged close links with Washington - sometimes,
it would seem, at the expense of strengthening its more natural political,
social and cultural ties with Europe.
Perhaps the UDF feels indebted to Washington. Organisations sponsored by the
Republican and Democratic parties donated more than Dollars 1.7m to the UDF
campaign during last June's elections - a lot for a small country which the
US ignored for so long. Those funds were earmarked for computers,
manifestos, leaflets, and other material to try to break the Communists'
stranglehold over the media during the elections. The Bulgarian (former
Communist) Socialist party still managed to win.
The AFL-CIO, the US trade union movement, has funded Podkrepa, the
independent trade union led by Mr Konstantin Trenchev, a declared supporter
of Thatcherite policies. Western diplomats believe US officials helped Mr
Trenchev manage the street demonstrations and strikes last December which
toppled Mr Andre Lukanov's socialist government. And no sooner had the
coalition government been formed, than Mr Trenchev immediately endorsed a
'social agreement' between trade unions, the government and employees.
Such transatlantic influence is not appreciated everywhere in Bulgaria. In
the words of one young Bulgarian journalist: 'It is a bit unusual that at a
time when workers face privatisation, unemployment and factory closures, Mr
Trenchev receives his advice from the AFL-CIO, and advocates such right-wing
policies.'
That turmoil was five months ago. Since then, US advisers have continued to
flow in. One of them, from the State Department's Agency for International
Development, exuded a sense of mission when asked what he was doing in
Bulgaria.
'We give aid,' he explained.
'For free?'
'No. You can't give aid away. It would fall into the hands of the
Communists. We give it to the private sector (which barely exists). Of
course, there's no such thing as free aid.' Other officials said they had
come to help with the local government elections, scheduled for the summer.
Aid is one thing which is desperately needed in Bulgaria. But it appears to
go hand-in-hand with political advice. A UDF official explained how US
diplomats often advised the opposition about how to run their meetings and
formulate policy.
Because of its political diversity, the UDF is struggling to remain united
for the forthcoming local and parliamentary elections. Two 'factions' now
exist: the centre/liberal bloc, led by Mr Peter Dertliev, leader of the
Social Democrats; and a right-wing bloc, which is susceptible to the growing
influence of the Monarchists.
'Instinctively we support the right-wing of the UDF,' said one US official.
'But we are heading into big trouble if the Monarchists prevail.'
The US also supports the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, the political
organisation for the country's 1.5m ethnic Turks which has 22 seats in
parliament. As local and general elections approach, the MRF has been
brought into the ambit of the UDF. 'I would not deny that the US encouraged
us to include the Turks into our movement,' said one UDF parliamentary
deputy.
'Because of this, we could lose the elections. The anti-Turkish feeling is
easily exploited in this country,' complained Mr Rumen Vodenicharov, a
member of the UDF's centre bloc.
Bulgarian Foreign Ministry officials admit the Turkish issue is very
sensitive, particularly since the ministry is saddled with repairing the
damage done by the Communist regime which attempted to assimilate the Turks
by force in the early 1980s.
Senior Bulgarian officials explain the disproportionately high US profile in
terms of a reaction to years of heavy-handed Soviet influence. 'This
influence is not something that the US wanted,' explained Mr Dimitar Popov,
the prime minister. 'It is something that our people wanted. Our whole life
was dominated by the Soviet presence. What is not certain is the extent to
which the US can meet the expectations of the Bulgarian people.'
Mr Dimitar Ludzhev, the deputy prime minister, said the US was more
'outgoing' than other western nations in its support of the Bulgarian
reforms. 'The US was the first to endorse Mr Zhelev when he was chosen as
president late last year,' he said.
There appears, however, to be a rather different consensus among western
diplomats and Bulgarian foreign policy experts. 'I actually think the US is
interfering in the internal affairs of this country,' one senior diplomat
said. He quoted a US official as saying that the embassy would strongly
dissuade Bulgaria from signing any bilateral friendship treaty with Moscow
which hinders its defence options.
A veteran diplomat in Bulgaria believes the US may have long-term strategic
interests there. 'We know the cold war is over. But Turkey, which borders
with Bulgaria, is in Nato. The US may think that it is no harm to have an
extra ally in this volatile region of Europe. I actually think Bulgaria's
interests lie with strengthening its trade, cultural and political ties with
Europe. The US is far, far away. Bulgaria could be dumped at any time.'

FT  03 MAY 91 / Armenia questions Kremlin's integrity

ACCUSATIONS mounted yesterday that the Kremlin might be seeking to rekindle
the long-running land dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan to serve its
own political interests.
Armenians say 36 people died on Tuesday when Soviet interior ministry troops
stormed two Armenian-populated villages north of the disputed enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh, which is inside Azerbaijan but which Armenia lays claims
to.
The official aim of the operation was to crush Armenian guerrillas operating
in and outside the enclave.
Mr Levon Ter-Petrosian, the Armenian president, said yesterday the violence
appeared to have subsided after a promise by Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev on Tuesday to bring the situation under control.
But he told the Reuters news agency that he had evidence the attack was
designed to hinder Armenia's drive for independence and shore up Mr Ayaz
Mutalibov, Azerbaijan's Communist president.
Mr David Vardanyan, a senior Armenian parliamentary leader, told journalists
in Moscow that he believed Soviet military action was a reward by the
Kremlin for Azerbaijan's decision last week to sign the union treaty.
The renewed trouble also follows Armenia's controversial decision last week
to confiscate all Communist party property on its territory. President
Gorbachev has issued a decree overruling that move.
Significantly, a spokesman for Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry voiced
suspicion over why trouble had started after three months of relative calm,
even though he denied Azerbaijan was to blame.
'It's in somebody's greater political interest that this should start again
now,' he said.
The two southern republics' conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh has cost hundreds
of lives over the past two years. It led last January to the Soviet army
declaring a state of emergency in Baku, the Azerbaijan capital, which is
still in force.
Since coming to power last summer, Mr Ter-Petrosian has succeeded in
disarming illegal Armenian militias, leading to a decline in clashes in
recent months. He warned yesterday, however, that any attempt to deport
Armenian militants from inside Azerbaijan could trigger violence beyond his
control.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Moscow clings on to east European reins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STUDENTS from Prague's College of Art were told recently that they could not
remove an old Soviet tank from the capital's fifth district.
So they decided to paint it a different colour. Pink.
Soviet diplomats were furious. There were protests, discussions, and
apologies all round. The tank, marking the liberation of Czechoslovakia by
the Red Army in 1945, was restored to its former colour. Khaki.
The fuss by Soviet officials exemplifies the deep sensitivities which today
characterise relations between the Soviet Union and its former east European
allies.
The Soviet military, and the older Soviet generation, resent what they see
as the growing ingratitude of the east Europeans for the way in which the
Red Army 'liberated' these countries from Hitler's Wehrmacht. They and
Communist party hardliners are also beginning to feel that the demise of the
Warsaw Pact and the cold war exposes the vulnerability of the Soviet Union's
own security.
This vulnerability forms the background to negotiations taking place on a
bilateral level between Moscow and the east European states. The Soviet
Union, and all the east European countries, want to place their relations on
a new and equal footing through friendship treaties.
As Mr David Meiszter, head of the Hungarian delegation to the talks with
Moscow, explained: 'The agreement should reflect a new quality of
partnership between Hungary and the Soviet Union, and comply with the
interests of both parties and the new European realities.'
But the Soviets have gone one stage further in interpreting the content of
the treaties, insisting that they should include a clause which states that
neither country will participate in any alliance directed against each
other.
This clause is already contained in the 'Treaty on co-operation,
good-neighbourliness and friendship' signed on March 22, between the Soviet
Union and Romania, the only country so far to have signed a treaty.
This pact also states that 'the two countries pledge not to tolerate the use
of their territories by a third state to commit an act of aggression against
the other side, and not to support such a state.'
Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, all of which aspire to
eventual membership of the European Community, staunchly oppose the
inclusion of this clause into any treaty.
Mr Tamas Katona, state secretary at the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, said
last week that 'the Soviet Union would like to achieve the creation of a
neutral region in eastern Europe similar to Finland.'
Mr Meiszter explained further that 'any clause which limits the scope of
action of Hungarian foreign policy is unacceptable.'
A Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry official said yesterday: 'There is a
stalemate in the negotiations between Prague and Moscow. From the
psychological perspective, somehow the Soviet military believes that we (the
countries of eastern Europe) are still within their sphere of influence;
that it is their right. They do not realise this is no longer the case.'
Polish diplomats are keen to stress the realpolitik of any agreement. 'There
is the question of geography - the size of Poland, where we are situated in
Europe. But they want us to state that we will not aspire to any alliance,'
commented a Polish diplomat.
'Our foreign minister, (Mr Krzysztof Skubiszewski) has always been cautious
about Poland aspiring to membership of any other alliance.'
However, over the past year several east European leaders, including
President Lech Walesa of Poland, have visited Nato headquarters to discover
what role the alliance (and maybe their own countries) will play in the new
Europe.
The Soviet Union may be persuaded to back down on the disputed clause
because it does not want to see the rest of the treaty jeopardised.
Whatever the outcome of the discussion, east European diplomats believe it
has highlighted the need for rethinking the whole of Europe's future
security arrangements.

<TEXT>
FIAT HAS agreed to loosen its hold on tractor dealerships in Italy as the
price for gaining European Community approval for its purchase of Ford's New
Holland agricultural machinery subsidiary.
Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, said yesterday that Fiat's
competitors would thus have 'a significant opportunity to improve their
market position in Italy'.
Fiat has ended its exclusive supply arrangements with a national grouping of
72 consorzi or farmers' co-operatives, each of which can now choose to
continue with Fiat or not. In addition, Fiat will give former New Holland
dealers a 15-day option to end their current distribution contracts.
Sir Leon warned, however, that he would keep a close watch to see that
competition was safeguarded 'because of the high level of concentration on
the EC market as a whole'.
By acquiring Ford New Holland, Fiat would become the EC market leader in
farming machinery. But the Commission concluded that Fiat would still face
enough competition to justify letting through the acquisition, vetted under
new merger control powers.

<TEXT>
A MILESTONE German-Poland treaty, in which Poland recognises its German
minority for the first time since 1945, will be signed next month by the
countries' leaders.
The German government said yesterday the friendship and co-operation treaty
would fundamentally alter previously strained relations between the two
nations. Bonn would now proceed step-by-step towards the same relationship
with Poland as it has with France.
The 38-article treaty, together with a border accord signed last November,
is to be submitted to both parliaments for approval.
Warsaw previously denied the existence of ethnic Germans in Poland;
estimates put their number at up to 200,000. In a draft treaty approved by
the foreign ministers of the two countries last weekend, Poland agreed to
grant full equality to its Germans.
In return Germany will fully support Polish associated status in the
European Community as a first step towards full membership.
Both countries say they will work closely to achieve 'co-operative
structures' for Europe, together with members of the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE).
Germany is Poland's main western trading partner and Warsaw hopes for
substantial German investment.
Ethnic Germans in Poland will be given full educational, cultural and
religious equality with Poles.
They, and not officials, will decide whether they belong to the German
minority and will be allowed to use their German family names.
Ethnic Poles in Germany - many of whom arrived in the last century and were
assimilated - are to enjoy the same rights.
The Federation of Expellees in Germany strongly criticised Mr Hans Dietrich
Genscher, the foreign minister, this week for ignoring its demands focusing
on the rights of ethnic Germans expelled from Poland after the Second World
War.
Warsaw has voiced concern over plans by ethnic Germans in Upper Silesia to
meet German expellees next month at Annaberg, site of a fierce battle in
1921 between German soldiers and Polish nationalists.

MOST people in the European Community think that by the end of the century
they will be able to work anywhere in an enlarged EC, be paid in a single
currency and defended by a common EC military force.
This majority feeling that Community integration is inevitable, as well as
generally desirable, emerges from the latest Eurobarometer opinion poll,
sponsored by the Commission and published yesterday.
Out of some 13,000 people interviewed in March, 55 per cent said they
thought it was realistic to expect east European countries in the EC by the
year 2000. The ratio rose to 63 per cent in the case of neutral European
countries joining. Some 64 per cent expected a single currency, while 58 per
cent thought a common military force was realistic.
The wish, however, is father to the thought. In Denmark, 91 per cent
believed the accession to the EC by fellow Scandinavians was imminent, but
only 45 per cent of immigration-sensitive Danes considered free residence
rights were on the cards.
The one, predictable, drop in Euro-enthusiasm was detected in east Germany,
where the ratio of those giving the EC a positive endorsement dropped to 79
per cent, from 87 per cent last autumn.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Turks face tough choices in crusade against inflation and
debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKISH economic policy is in growing disarray, with the government and the
state bureaucracy increasingly deadlocked over how to tackle the twin
problems of inflation and public debt.
Ministers are being criticised by central bank and Treasury officials
concerned by the government's reluctance to curb spending as the country
prepares for general elections, which must be held before 1992.
Mr Rusdu Saracoglu, the central bank governor, a pivotal figure in Turkey's
economic recovery in the 1980s, believes that without a commitment to fiscal
restraint the bank cannot announce its 1991 monetary programme.
'The system is under great pressure. In our country short-term advances
drawn from the central bank are being used to bridge the budget deficit.
This is wrong,' he says.
Fiscal policy has long been Turkey's most pressing problem, aggravated by
the narrowness of Turkish capital markets and government concern to contain
foreign borrowing. In March the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) warned there was now a great temptation to resort to
'money creation which would have serious inflationary consequences'.
Central bank lending to the Treasury - in effect printing money to cover the
budget - has already exceeded the TL3,500bn (Pounds 530m) ceiling for
short-term low interest borrowing, agreed last year.
Mr Saracoglu complains that liquidity ratios, which require banks to hold 30
per cent of deposits in Treasury bills, are now being ignored by many
institutions. As a result the Treasury is forced increasingly to use central
bank credits for budget finance.
In this sort of climate it will be hard to rescue the central bank's
programme, which by keeping the growth of its own balance sheet below
nominal GNP was largely responsible for containing inflation in 1990 to
about 50 per cent.
'No central bank in the world can solve inflation if the government has such
a big budget deficit,' an Istanbul banker says.
Turkish employers enter annual pay talks with the unions later this month.
Before that the Soils Products Office has to announce 1991 support prices
for grains and other crops.
Meanwhile, in Paris in early June, Turkey has to give its annual account of
its economy to the OECD.
Given such a timetable the economic choices look even more daunting.
Mr Mahfi Egilmez, Treasury assistant under-secretary, warns: 'It is too late
for short-term ad hoc measures.'
The official target for the fiscal deficit was set at 7.5 per cent of GNP.
Mr Egilmez says that the central government's deficit alone - which excludes
state enterprises - could reach TL30,000bn, compared with the TL20,000bn
target.
The central bank is calling for a new medium-term austerity programme to
control public finances. 'Selling the programme, articulating the policy and
convincing the public at large is now essential,' says Mr Saracoglu.
Last week President Turgut Ozal warned the unions their current demands
could set the country back 10 years. Mr Isin Celebi, the economics minister,
announced he would end support for tobacco and grain prices.
Though politically difficult, cutting farm subsidies is clearly one
immediate option, together with a freeze on civil servants' salaries and a
new pricing policy to reduce losses of state enterprises.
The politicians' concern is that more far-reaching cuts could damage the
electoral chances of the ruling Motherland party (ANAP).
Mr Celebi predicts nothing will be decided until after ANAP delegates meet
in June, when liberals in the party are expected to challenge Mr Yildirim
Akbulut, the prime minister, for the party leadership.
However, bankers and foreign economists are worried that without a fuller
cabinet shake-up, any new programme will have little credibility.

THE European Community should be tougher towards foreigners wanting to enter
the EC, but tenderer to immigrants already settled there, according to a
Brussels document for discussion by foreign ministers later this month.
The paper, which the Commission is expected to approve formally next week,
talks of a rising tide of immigration from the Mediterranean and eastern
Europe. But its recommendations hardly amount to the Fortress Europe policy
feared by human right groups.
'The question is no longer how to stop immigration, but rather to influence
it in a positive way,' it says.
Apart from suggesting that the 12 EC states should harmonise their controls
on illegal immigration and procedures for dealing with people 'shopping'
around the Community for asylum, the thrust of the Commission's external
policy recommendations is to increase the economic incentives for
neighbouring populations to stay put.
Aid from the EC budget and individual member states should be targeted at
providing work for those most likely to migrate to the EC - the illiterate
poor in the cities of the south, and the professionals who create a brain
drain from developing countries by moving to the EC. The association
agreements that are being re-negotiated with Mediterranean and east European
countries this year should deal specifically with migration policy.
On the internal front, the Commission suggests that immigrants who retain
third country nationality, but are legally established in the Community,
should no longer be denied the freedom to travel or the access to national
or EC social benefits that EC citizens have.
The Twelve are shortly expected to ratify a convention that will pave the
way for a common tourist visa for third country nationals. This will create
a ridiculous situation, said an EC official yesterday, in which 'an
Ethiopian visitor, for instance, will be able to swan around the Community
on one visa, whereas a longtime, legal Algerian resident of France will
continue to need a visa for each of the other 11 EC countries he might want
to visit'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S current account surplus in March fell 46.5 per cent from a year
earlier to Dollars 4.3bn (Pounds 2.54bn), though the decline was exaggerated
by the transfer of much of a Dollars 9bn contribution to the Gulf war
effort, the Ministry of Finance announced yesterday.
The transfer masked a 13.6 per cent increase in exports and only a 5.6 per
cent increase in imports, which brought the trade surplus for the month to
Dollars 10.488bn, which was 31.6 per cent higher than the same month last
year.
For the Japanese fiscal year to end March, the current account surplus was
Dollars 33.8bn, down 36.7 per cent from fiscal 1989, but it was also
distorted by Gulf payments and higher than the official estimate of Dollars
32bn.
Finance Ministry officials said the surplus was larger than expected because
of the quick end to the Gulf war, lower oil prices, and a strong export
performance, which the government fears will continue for the rest of this
year and increase trade tensions.
The trend appears to be continuing.
In a preliminary report for the first 20 days of April, the ministry said
that the country had a customs-cleared trade surplus of Dollars 2.8bn,
compared to a deficit of Dollars 16.4m during the same period last year.
Japanese investors were again sellers of foreign securities in March, with
net sales of bonds at Dollars 2.539bn and net stock sales at Dollars 292m,
after having been net purchasers of both during February.
Meanwhile, foreigners remained net purchasers of Japanese stocks at Dollars
6.2bn after net purchases of Dollars 8.5bn in February.
The figures for the fiscal year reflected the dramatic change in Japanese
capital flows that began early last year.
Japanese investors' net purchases of foreign stocks totalled only Dollars
847m, down from Dollars 22.9bn in the previous year, while net bond
purchases totalled Dollars 41.4bn, down from Dollars 80.9bn.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES belonging to South Korea's largest business groups will be denied
new bank credit from next Monday if they fail to dispose of idle land by
then, according to a new set of measures aimed at curbing real estate
speculation.
The package of measures, the most stringent yet to be taken in the
government's attempt to reduce speculation, followed an order by President
Roh Tae Woo that economic ministers take all possible steps to force
business groups to sell surplus land.
Speculation in real estate has prompted sharp increases in land and rental
prices in South Korea. It has also caused a widening in the gap between rich
and poors, creating tensions.
'The measures show that we are serious about tackling the problem of wealth
distribution and about bridging the gap between the haves and have nots,'
said Mr Kim Hak Joon, senior chief assistant to the president for policy
research.
But the new package will further add to strains between the government and
the chaebol, the large business groups which dominate the economy.
Government-business relations have already been damaged by a government plan
to encourage greater specialisation by the highly diversified big business
groups. Under the plan, to be implemented from June, each group will select
three companies as core business groups. These companies will be freed from
existing credit controls.
According to the measures announced yesterday, however, the number of core
businesses could be further reduced for companies which do not sell their
idle land.
The economic planning board, the top economic ministry, said groups which do
not dispose of idle land will be restricted to just one core business.
Last year, the government listed 57.44m pyong (189.55m square metres) of
land owned by 48 conglomerates as non-business land. They ordered the
conglomerates to sell the land by May 4 this year. But as of Tuesday, only
34.57m pyong, or 60.2 per cent of the land, had been disposed of.
Under the anti-speculation measures, 38 subsidiaries of 21 business groups
will be denied new credit from Monday.
The affected groups include, Hyundai, Korea's second biggest conglomerate,
and Daewoo, the fourth largest.
In addition, 17 business groups will be restricted to one core business
unless they dispose of excess real estate by the end of May. These groups
also include Daewoo and Hyundai.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FOREIGN governments and relief organisations yesterday pledged millions of
dollars of aid to Bangladesh which was struck by the most powerful cyclone
in its 20-year history on Monday.
The cyclone has killed 37,000, and the death toll could rise above 100,000,
relief officials in Dhaka said yesterday. At least 20,000 people were still
missing, many of them swept from islands in the Bay of Bengal by tidal waves
reaching six metres in height.
More than 10m people have lost their homes, cattle and crops. Preliminary
estimates put the damage at Dollars 415m (Pounds 235m), but the final total
could be much higher.
Joint efforts by government and aid organisations to provide an early
warning system monitored by Red Crescent workers and cyclone shelters did
help to save lives, Oxfam said. More than half a million people were
evacuated from the most vulnerable areas - although many decided to stay to
protect their possessions and livestock.
The relief operation will provide a tough test for Mrs Khaleda Zia,
Bangladesh's first woman prime minister, who took office in March.
Mrs Zia must ensure aid is distributed fairly and honestly - something that
previous military-controlled governments were not renowned for.
Britain pledged immediate aid of Pounds 2.5m, with more to follow during the
country's rehabilitation.
A total of 10m ecus (Dollars 12m) will be given by the European Community. A
spokesman for the EC Commission said it had agreed to buy Dollars 9.6m-worth
of wheat and vegetable oil from Bangladeshi government stocks for immediate
distribution.
Medical supplies, tents and blankets worth a further Dollars 2.4m are to be
distributed by the Red Cross and other relief organisations. The US has
pledged Dollars 20m of medicine
The Save the Children Fund has given Pounds 250,000 for building materials
and cooking utensils. The Catholic Fund for Overseas Development (Cafod),
has given Pounds 200,000.

FT  03 MAY 91 / US envoy will take up an uncertain special relationship

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Raymond Seitz arrives in London today as US ambassador to Britain, facing
greater uncertainty in transatlantic relations than appears on the surface.
The conventional view in London is that, after a tense period during the
first 15 months of the Bush administration, relations between the US and
Britain have improved considerably. Since last November Mr Bush and Mr John
Major have worked well together, especially during the war in the Gulf.
All this is true - and Britain played its loyal ally card to the full during
the war. But it should not be exaggerated in the way that some Conservatives
are apt to do in celebrating an alleged return to the 'special
relationship'.
Revealingly, at the swearing-in ceremony for Mr Seitz at the State
Department on Wednesday, neither the new ambassador nor Mr James Baker,
secretary of state, mentioned the term. Americans prefer to talk about the
Atlantic Alliance.
Valued as Britain is on defence matters, especially non-Nato ones,
Washington views the UK as part of Europe. As Mr Seitz pointed out last
month, Britain has decided that much of its future lies with Europe, and it
faces the challenge of maintaining a strong alliance with the US while also
being 'good Europeans'.
That will not always be easy, as was shown last month when, independently of
Washington, Mr Major launched his plan for safe havens for Kurdish refugees
at a meeting of EC heads of government. When, a few days later, Mr Bush
adopted the plan, his spokesman, addressing a domestic audience, claimed the
credit for the president. This stimulated exaggerated stories of a split,
but the apparent snub rankled.
The White House is now aware that a mistake was made and wants to make
amends, and that message has apparently been sent to Downing Street.
The tilt by the Major government towards the EC occurs at a time when
Washington is reassessing its broader relations with Europe.
Mr Seitz will also have to handle several delicate bilateral issues, such as
airline landing rights and market access for telecommunications companies.
As assistant secretary for European and Canadian affairs for the past two
years, Mr Seitz is well placed to act as an interlocutor at a time when
transatlantic relations are at their most uncertain since the late 1940s. He
is the first foreign service officer to be US ambassador to Britain, in more
than 200 years. He knows British politics well from his period as deputy
chief of mission in the late 1980s, so his appointment has been widely
welcomed both among State Department officials and in Whitehall and
Westminster.

FT  03 MAY 91 / Pretoria to meet most of ANC's ultimatum
</HEADLINE>

   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT FW de Klerk offered yesterday to include South Africa's black
opposition groups in his cabinet and promised to amend tough security laws
in an effort to avoid threatened confrontation with the African National
Congress.
The moves, in a speech by Mr de Klerk to parliament in Cape Town, was the
government's reply to an ultimatum from the ANC which expires next Thursday.
The ANC has said it will boycott talks on a post-apartheid constitution
unless the government acts by then to halt township violence in which nearly
10,000 people have died since 1984.
Mr de Klerk offered concessions on most of the demands, although there is
still a fair chance that the ANC will suspend talks. He will not accede to
the ANC's call for the dismissal of Mr Adriaan Volk, law and order minister,
and of General Magnus Malan, defence minister.
He is attempting to go some way towards meeting most of the other six points
in the ultimatum: dismantling of all counter-insurgency units; suspension of
policemen involved in two incidents where ANC supporters were killed; a ban
on the carrying of weapons at public gatherings; a ban on the issue of live
ammunition to police at such events; phasing out of single-sex township
hostels; and an independent inquiry into complaints of security force
misconduct.
Mr de Klerk said he would go ahead with all-party talks on May 24 and 25
about ways to end the violence 'with or without the ANC.'
Responding to one of the ultimatum's seven demands, Mr de Klerk said he
would scrap some of the most hated provisions of the country's Internal
Security Act, the law used to crush anti-apartheid protest in the 1980s.
The aim, he said, was to strip the law of 'provisions that may have an
inhibiting effect on participation in normal political activities'.
The act's sweeping authority to banish dissidents, close newspapers and put
anti-apartheid activists under house arrest would be removed.
Mr de Klerk stopped short of announcing the abolition of detention without
trial, saying that the provisions for declaring organisations illegal and
detaining people for questioning - section 29 of the act - would be 'amended
drastically'. The ANC has called for the act to be repealed.
In a move which may go some way towards meeting the ANC's demand for an
interim government, Mr de Klerk suggested that a transitional cabinet could
include 'a relatively broad spectrum of competent South Africans', including
members of the main parties to constitutional negotiations.
Such a cabinet, which would by implication include the ANC, could only be
formed after a planned multi-party conference had been convened to discuss
drawing up a new constitution.
Dealing with other aspects of the ANC ultimatum, he announced a 10-point
plan to combat the violence which has claimed more than 100 lives in the
past week.
He said that the police force would be strengthened, community involvement
would be sought to end violence and a permanent commission under a judge
would investigate causes of unrest.
There would also be job creation programmes to improve social conditions in
townships, and money for victims of violence.
The men-only hostels, where much of the violence has been centred, would be
converted or upgraded and control of dangerous weapons would be
'intensified'.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telegraph and Telephone (AT&amp;T) yesterday extended its Dollars
90-a-share tender offer for NCR, the Ohio-based computer manufacturer, until
May 20.
AT&amp;T offered to increase the bid price to Dollars 110 a share over a week
ago, but suggested replacing the consideration by paper rather than cash.
Mr Charles Exley, NCR chairman, has said he would recommend that his board
accept this, but only if certain protection was provided against a fall in
the AT&amp;T share price.
MIDWAY Airlines, the struggling Chicago-based carrier which filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March, yesterday reported a net loss of
Dollars 16.4m in the first quarter of 1991.
Revenues in the three-month period were down from Dollars 157.2m to Dollars
151.7m, but operating expenses fell more sharply, to Dollars 169.1m from
Dollars 183.3m.
At the beginning of the quarter, the company began to pull out of its
ill-fated Philadelphia expansion scheme, having agreed to sell assets there
to USAir. The net loss compared with a Dollars 22.9m deficit in the same
period of 1990.

FT  02 MAY 91 / A less than settled future for Lt-Gen Ehud: The defence
considerations of the new Israeli Chief of Staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Lt-Gen Ehud Barak, an officer whose academic record is almost as
eyecatching as his impressive military exploits, took over as Chief of Staff
of the Israel Defence Forces last month, he inherited a strategic outlook
for Israel which looked a good deal rosier than it did four months ago,
before the Gulf war.
The Iraqi military threat to Israel, previously a top concern, had been
dismantled; ascendant Arab leaders were moderates such as President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt while Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
which backed Iraq, had been weakened.
But there are other elements which are seen as less reassuring and are
likely to preoccupy Gen Barak as he settles into his new post.
They include the question of whether Israel's lack of response to Iraqi Scud
missile attacks, damaged its all-important deterrent credibility, and
concern about Syria.
But probably the issue most immediately pressing is how to fund the hugely
expensive high-tech weapons Israel now wants to acquire.
Israel wants its own real-time satellite intelligence capability to combat
surface-to-surface missiles like the Scuds, its own Patriot anti-missile
batteries and wants to complete development, jointly with the US, of its
still-nascent Arrow anti-missile system.
The IDF says it will also continue to stress its offensive capability. It
possesses - and Israel itself can produce - many of the precision weapons
and systems used to such effect by the allies during the war against Iraq.
But it wants more and better.
The costs, however, are huge and the IDF has for some years been under
considerable budgetary restraint. This is set to continue as the country is
forced to devote big resources to the absorption of large-scale Soviet
immigration.
Already, Gen Barak has signalled that the IDF must slim down in size in
order to be able to afford the weapons it wants. 'There is no escaping
this,' said Col Ra'anan Gissin, the IDF deputy spokesman. 'We have to
decrease the order of battle so we have less units but of higher quality.
This is the major challenge that the new Chief of Staff will have to deal
with.'
Maintaining a qualitative edge is an important element in Israel's deterrent
posture. One argument says this posture was undermined during the war when
Israel, under pressure from the US, failed to deliver on its promise of
massive retaliation.
There is also some concern that the severe disruption to civilian life
caused by the Scuds, despite low casualties, exposed an Israeli weakness to
missile attacks on its civilian 'rear'.
'There is no doubt that more than a few strategists in Damascus and Tripoli
estimate that if missiles based on 30-year-old technology can paralyse an
entire country for two weeks, then the preferred action now is to acquire a
greater number of more advanced ballistic missiles,' wrote military
commentator Reuven Pedatzur.
The contrary view is that the war showed Washington's willingness to defend
Israel directly against unprovoked attack by sending Patriot missiles,
enhancing Israel's deterrent strength.
The IDF insists publicly on the latter view. But Col Gissin acknowledged
that in future, the military will have to consider external restraints on
its use of force. 'There may be situations where you have to hold back, not
because of lack of necessary force or motivation,' he said.
With Iraq removed as a threat, the main focus of IDF strategic concern has
once again swung back to Syria.
The outgoing Chief of Staff, Gen Dan Shomron, said Damascus does not look in
a position to wage war against Israel, having lost the important possibility
of heavyweight Iraqi support and unable to count on the backing of the
Soviet Union, its traditional superpower sponsor.
But the Israeli perception is that President Hafez al-Assad remains
committed to achieving 'strategic parity' with Israel to give himself a
credible military threat.
Much concern has been voiced since the Gulf war ended over shipments of
Scud-C missiles of much greater accuracy than the enhanced Scud-Bs used by
Iraq, said to have been sent by North Korea to Syria.
The other ever-present issue for Gen Barak is the Palestinian uprising in
the occupied territories, now in its 40th month.
At times  - most recently in remarks by Gen Shomron  - the IDF has appeared
to suggest that it would favour some exchange of West Bank and Gaza
territory for a political settlement that would free the military from
policing a hostile population.
This, however, cuts across the stance of the present government of Mr
Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, and Mr Moshe Arens, the defence
minister, who appointed Gen Barak. They show no sign of shifting their
position, whatever advice the army might offer. Illust. Ehud Bahak: Facing
challenge of funding new weapons

THE Bush administration has banned the export to China of parts for a

proliferation concerns.
However, President Bush approved export of components for an Australian
communications satellite and a Swedish weather satellite to be launched from
China.
These were to be controlled by 'others' before and after the launches, a US
official said.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman, said the US was encouraging
China to observe internationally accepted guidelines on missile exports.

FT  02 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets: London's Seaq seeks to raise its
profile in global equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOWELL and MARK MAKEPEACE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recently launched Eurotrack indices were designed with two objectives in
mind: to promote the international equity market that has grown up in London
around Seaq International and to service the needs of the international
professional investors.
Global investing is now a reality. Overseas investment in foreign shares has
risen from around Dollars 300bn worldwide in 1985 to more than Dollars
1,500bn in 1989. Today, more than one transaction in every seven in world
equity markets has a foreign investor on the other side. Europe, excluding
the UK, accounts for roughly one third of all cross-border transactions made
worldwide and, within Europe's equity markets, one in every three
transactions now involves a foreign investor.
The global market is dominated by large international institutional
investors such as pension and life assurance funds. These professional
investors demand liquidity  - London is sometimes the only market able to
give it to them. The average bargain size for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange
is Dollars 50,000; on the Paris exchange it is estimated at less than
Dollars 25,000, compared with an estimated average bargain size of Dollars
275,000 for Seaq International.
In 1990, turnover in international stocks on Seaq International amounted to
more than Dollars 525bn, with more than Dollars 330bn or almost two thirds
of that turnover in continental European stocks.
For 1990 as a whole, Seaq trading in international shares almost equalled
turnover in domestic UK and Irish shares traded on the London Stock
Exchange. In the same year, Seaq accounted for more than half of the total
cross-exchange business (shares traded in a market that is foreign to the
nationality of a share) worldwide.
London now trades more than a quarter of the volume of the Paris exchange in
French shares, around half of the local volume in the Netherlands, 19 per
cent of local Spanish volume and more than 12 per cent of the local volume
on the German exchanges.
Firm quotes (securities, usually blue chips, on which there are committed
prices) on Seaq usually account for less than half of the total
capitalisation (or market value) of the home markets. There has been a
healthy growth in firm quotes in the first quarter of 1991, particularly in
France, Germany and Italy.
Eurotrack is expected to encourage further the concentration of trading in
Europe's leading international shares in London.
The three FT-SE indices  - the FT-SE 100 (UK), FT-SE Eurotrack 100 (Europe
excluding UK) and FT-SE Eurotrack 200 (all Europe)  - make it possible for
investors to construct and trade their European portfolios on a single
market, avoiding the vagaries, delays and cost of trading across many
markets.
Early indications are that investors will use the FT-SE index of 200 leading
European stocks either as a benchmark for Europe or as a tradeable sub-set
of the European component of the existing world indices, such as the
FT-Actuaries World Indices, Morgan Stanley Capital Index or the
Salomon-Russell indices.
The launch of the Eurotrack indices has already attracted much interest from
the derivative exchanges. Liffe is to begin trading a future on the FT-SE
Eurotrack 100 next month and the London Traded Options Market is due to
launch an option on the same index.
Similarly, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the world's largest
options market, intends to trade options on both Eurotrack indices and the
FT-SE 100.
There has already been a spate of over-the-counter warrants, and US
exchanges are expected to begin to trade Eurotrack warrants on their market
floors before long. Such derivatives are an essential prerequisite for the
investment techniques now used by today's international professional
investor.
Eurotrack derivatives will reduce the need for the investor to mix and match
several local market indices to hedge a European portfolio. Instead,
professional investors will be able to use the Eurotrack futures and options
to hedge their total European portfolios, or they might use the Eurotrack
indices together with other indices to create their own synthetic global and
European derivative combinations to suit their own investment objectives.
At least one leading insurance fund in the UK is already using the FT-SE
Eurotrack 100, together with the US Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and Japanese
Topix/Nikkei 225 indices to manage its global (excluding the UK) portfolio.
Another strategy suggested by the derivative experts is to use the FT-SE
Eurotrack 100 in combination with local market index contracts based, for
example, on the DAX in Germany, CAC 40 in France, and SMI in Switzerland, to
tilt the fund's exposure towards or away from a particular country within
continental Europe.
A close correlation exists between the country components of Eurotrack and
the European country benchmark indices; the German, French and Swiss
components, with correlations of 0.99, are expected to be the most popular
synthetic derivative combinations.
In the future, professional investors are expected to use the Eurotrack
indices to create and manage the indexed core of their European portfolios,
and to use other structured products and active strategies to take advantage
of known inefficiencies in the market or trends such as the small companies
effect.
The International Stock Exchange in London, therefore, believes that the
Eurotrack concept and the family of associated products offer convenience,
liquidity and simplicity to existing and prospective investors in European
stock markets.
This greater visibility is expected to be good news for the Seaq
International market.
Michael Howell is research director at Salomon Brothers International and
was involved in setting up the Eurotrack indices.

Stock Exchange.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley to press ahead with sell-off
of ECGD division - Trade and Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER LILLEY, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday ignored Labour
demands for the abandonment of the sale of the Insurance Services Group of
the Export Credit Guarantee Department.
He insisted that privatisation of the concern would ensure that it was
'better in tune' with the European Community single market.
Leading the demands for the abandonment of the sale in the Commons Mr Gordon
Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, quoted the view of the British
Exporters Association that it was turning into 'a shambles'.
He argued since there was no serious British bidder the organisation could
be controlled from Rome or Amsterdam.
Mr Brown maintained that the government's decision to pursue the sale was
privatisation 'for privatisation's sake'.
Mr Lilley emphasised that other EC countries, including Germany, the
Netherlands, France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal and Spain relied on the
private sector to provide export credit facilities. He said Denmark and
Ireland were also considering privatising their export agencies.
Mr Lilley told Mr Brown: 'For the same reasons we believe that export credit
for short term business should be in the private sector'.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, the trade minister, confirmed that the invitation to
tender had brought 'responses' from three companies  - Assicurazioni
Generali, NCM and Trade Indemnity.
He said: 'There will now be a period of evaluation by Government and its
advisers, with a view to proceeding as quickly as practicable with the sale
of the short term business, subject to the successful passage of the Export
and Investment Guarantee Bill.'
The financial robustness of the proposed purchaser, the price offered, and
commitment to and understanding of the business would be among the factors
taken into account.
Ms Joyce Quin, from the Labour front bench, described the proposed sale as a
'fiasco'.
She claimed that exporters were alarmed and dismayed at the prospect of the
organisation being privatised.
Mr Sainsbury replied that the CBI, amongst others, had welcomed the proposed
privatisation which would enable the the Insurance Services Group to provide
better and more flexible services to British industry.
Mr Edward Leigh, junior trade and industry minister, yesterday encouraged
the Post Office to seek ways of offering greater choice to its customers.
He said 'We are prepared to look at any proposal put forward by the Post
Office to improve the quality of services to the customer'.
Mr Leigh, an enthusiastic advocate of privatisation, denied that the steps
already taken by the Post Office to establish separate divisions for its
counter, mails and parcels services were intended as a prelude to
privatisation.

FT  02 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Bid speculation encourages late rally
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A LATE SURGE in London equities yesterday, at the end of a lacklustre day,
was triggered by Wall Street's opening firmness and encouraged by a bout of
speculation that a takeover bid was being prepared for a Footsie stock.
For most of the session, however, shares traded quietly in a narrow range as
investors and traders braced themselves for today's UK local elections.
Modest overnight rises on Wall Street and in Tokyo meant that the FT-SE 100
index opened only just into positive territory. Early company news was not
encouraging - there was a profits warning from food retailer Budgens - and
the Footsie index soon drifted lower.
A rights issue from the Bank of Scotland focused attention on the view that
institutions were beginning to be stretched by cash calls. 'The fuel for the
rally is used up,' said Mr Robin Aspinall at Schroders.
Such concern was underlined by the latest survey of pension fund liquidity
from Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps). It said provisionally
that cash balances in the first quarter of the year had fallen from 8.2 per
cent of investments to 5.3 per cent. The figures will be fin-alised within
three weeks.
However, Mr Roger Palmer at Kleinwort Benson argued that there was plenty of
buying power left in the funds: 'The historic average is 4 per cent.' He
acknowledged his bullishness was a minority view.
Optimistic talk on the prospects for inflation from Mr John Major, the prime
minister, served to ensure prices were off their worst by midsession. But it
took reassuringly rapid cuts in prime lending rates by US banks, in response
to the previous day's reduction in the Federal Reserve's discount rate, to
give Wall Street a flying start and activate trading in London.
Sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic was further improved by April's
survey of US purchasing managers. Its index rose for the third month in
succession, adding weight to the opinion that a US recovery was starting.
The Footsie index rose quickly through the 2,500 mark to end just off the
day's high at 2,508.4 for a net increase of 22.2. Turnover was 420m shares,
the highest of the week so far but still far below the levels at which
securities houses are confident of making money.
Analysts, faced with short- term electoral uncertainties, concentrated on
longer term prognoses. Mr Paul Walton at James Capel took an optimistic
line. He said the market had not yet discounted the strength of the recovery
in corporate earnings likely in 1992.
An aggregation of analysts' forecasts calculated by Capel pointed to an
almost 15 per cent earnings recovery next year. This would be only a
slightly smaller turnround than that which occurred after the recession of
the early 1980s. Mr Walton said that companies with high fixed costs and low
variable costs would benefit most.
The performance of the dollar, so influential at the start of the week, was
all but ignored. It lost ground and some international stocks fell. Others
were caught on the rising tide of bid talk. Speculation centred on
Allied-Lyons, but spilled over into other brewing and food issues.
Amid the excitement, cautious voices struggled to be heard. Chartists still
argued that the Footsie index could fall to 2,425; all agreed that a heavy
defeat by the Conservative party in today's polls would see such a figure
once more in the market's sights.

FT  02 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Further rise in Allied
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER chorus of orchestrated bid talk sent Allied-Lyons still higher
yesterday. US sources spoke of an opening offer of 640p per share from
either Anheuser-Busch or Philip Morris. Transatlantic analysts consider
Allied to be undervalued when compared with the ratings accorded to US
brewing majors.
The possibility of a bid from a UK conglomerate, such as Hanson, again met
with some scepticism. One analyst said: 'This is a classic bear squeeze and
the result of marketmakers having sold the stock massively short.'
Mr John Wakely of Shearson Lehman was of the opinion that the setback which
followed disclosure of the group's large currency loss had gone too far. UK
fund managers, he said, were now recognising the value in Allied-Lyons
shares, which contained no bid premium. It was 'pure gravy' for investment
funds. He remained a strong buyer of the stock, up 28 more at 573p after
turnover of 5.3m shares.
Oil find
An afternoon announcement from the oil majors, BP and Shell, detailing news
of a big oil find in the Gulf of Mexico, produced a surge of interest in the
two stocks, among the most easily traded in the world.
The two said they had found oil in their jointly controlled Mars prospect,
designated Mississippi Canyon wells, 763 and 807, in the Gulf of Mexico. BP
said the discovery could be the largest prospect it has participated in
since its North Sea discoveries. BP has a one third stake in the find and
Shell the remainder.
A big oil find in the Gulf of Mexico has been rumoured in the market for
many weeks, but indications that the find could contain more than 700m
barrels of oil, and possibly as much as 1bn barrels if the discovery extends
to adjacent areas, prompted a good rise in BP shares. They closed a net 7
stronger at 351p on turnover of 3.4m.
Shell was restrained by suggestions that the stock had encountered hefty
profit-taking from overseas, and finished unchanged at 525p, with strong
turnover of 6.9m shares indicating aggressive trading in the stock.
Mr Jeremy Hudson at Shearson Lehman said the discovery establishes Shell as
the biggest single player in the deep water Gulf of Mexico, and that the
Mars find would add around 2 per cent to the oil reserve bases of both
companies. Mr Nick Clayton at Smith New Court said the find vindicated BP's
confidence in the Gulf of Mexico programme and confirms the wisdom of its
farm-in programme some two years ago.
Banks diverge
Share prices of the two Scottish banks moved in opposite directions, Bank of
Scotland (BOS) closing higher on the day in spite of launching a near Pounds
200m rights issue and Royal Bank of Scotland down on the session after a
disappointing interim dividend.
The cash call from BOS, a three-for-ten at a 15 per cent discounted 87p a
share, accompanied the bank's preliminary results, a one-for-five
capitalisation and an agreed 70p a share offer for the 24.45 per cent of the
Bank of Wales it does not own. The rights offer, the first from a UK bank
since Standard Chartered's Pounds 300m issue in August 1988, had been mooted
by a number of analysts and came as no great surprise to the market.
It was generally agreed that the success of the BOS rights issue was
assured. Standard Life, which has a 33 per cent stake in BOS, said it would
take up its entitlement.
BOS, initially weak at 129p, closed a net 5 better at 136p with turnover a
much higher than usual 9.3m.
Royal Bank's interims were described as slightly better than expected; the
dividend was said to have been responsible for the shares settling a net 2
easier at 189p.
Food retailers up
The possibility of liberalised Sunday trading laws, and a shortage of stock,
gave the food retailing sector a strong boost. The rally followed Tuesday's
decision by the Court of Appeal to lift injunctions banning two home
improvement stores from opening on Sundays.
J. Sainsbury led the way with an advance of 18 to 383p and was helped by
encouraging words from Kleinwort Benson, which expects strong final results
in May. Tesco added 10 at 287p and Argyll gained 9 to 305p, although Asda
firmed just a penny to 121p as worries about current trading persisted.
Ladbroke rose 9 to 284p after saying it planned to open a further 20 Texas
superstores following the legal decision.
Sainsbury, with its home improvement division, stands to gain most from a
legalisation of Sunday trading. Analysts said the benefit to other food
retailers was less obvious. In any case, Tuesday's decision is due to be
challenged in the House of Lords and there remains uncertainty about whether
the UK government is politically committed to the changes in Sunday trading
laws.
Business services group BET continued to beat most Footsie stocks, in terms
of both activity and performance. The shares rose 7 further, for a gain so
far this week of 22, to 189p, and yesterday recorded the heaviest turnover
yet of 7.3m shares.
US presentations have aroused transatlantic interest in the stock, which has
also drawn support from UK fund managers because of the high yield offered.
But traders were beginning to wonder yesterday whether other factors, such
as hopes of a takeover, were promoting the current spate of buying.
Reuters continued its jittery performance over the last few weeks as County
NatWest downgraded the company. Its new forecasts are in line with the rest
of the market, but it accompanied the change with the view that confidence
in the company had been shaken by t 13 to 798p.
Standard Chartered outperformed the rest of the banks sector after a
positive meeting with a City broker and closed 9 higher at 388p. Other banks
were unsettled by the increases in bad debt provisions announced by the
Scottish banks.
Midland managed a minor gain at 216p ahead of today's annual meeting;
specialists said the bank needed a rights issue of around Pounds 500m but
that this was not expected today.
Williams Holdings eased 2 to 292p as 5m shares were placed at 290p. SG
Warburg was active in the stock.
News of both sharply higher full year profits and dividend took Silentnight
up 28 to 153p. Airsprung Furniture rose in sympathy to close 11 higher at
160p.
Dealers were dismayed by news of Amstrad's dismissal of its head of UK
operations, along with other sackings and the description by Mr Alan Sugar
of current trading as difficult. 'This has done more damage to confidence in
the stock,' said one specialist, who added that there has been nothing but a
stream of bad news from computer companies, such as Olivetti, Compaq and
IBM, in recent weeks. Amstrad ended 2 lower at 72p. Sharp profits downgrades
have been instigated by James Capel, Smith New Court and Kleinwort Benson.
Budgens declined 5 to 40p as the company issued a profits warning following
its announcement of board room changes. The shares were also depressed by
rights issue talk.
A rerating of Yule Catto stock followed Tuesday's annual results and upbeat
trading statement. Mr Charles Lambert of Smith New Court said Yule was one
of the best value smaller stocks around. The shares responded in a thin
market, rising 19 to 162p for a two-day gain of 29.
Trading activity contracted dramatically in Tootal as bidder Coats Viyella
was prevented from buying. The maximum price allowed for purchases is
83.05p. Coats confirmed yesterday that it had bought 10.4m shares on Tuesday
and was now deemed to hold 33.7 per cent of Tootal, unaltered at 84p. Coats
Viyella rallied 4 to 142p.
Advertising group Abbott Mead Vickers responded positively to stronger ties
with Omnicom, of the US. The latter increased its stake in AMV to 24.5 per
cent through the purchase by subsidiary BBDO Worldwide of 313,000 shares at
305p apiece. AMV issued the shares in deferred consideration of an
acquisition, and they were subsequently placed by the vendor. AMV closed 25
up at 303p.
WPP fell 13 to 204p. The appearance of two big sellers was the cause, said
traders, who emphasised that there were no developments on the trading
front.
Bid speculation surrounded Johnston Press and the price jumped 16 to 230p.
