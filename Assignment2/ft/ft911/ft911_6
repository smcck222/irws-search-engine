FT  02 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS continued to speculate on a fall in the Amstrad share price in the
traded options market yesterday following the dismissal of Mr Barry Young,
its UK managing director. The news fanned concern about current trading,
particularly in office computer sales.
Institutions were strong buyers of Amstrad September 60 puts and purchasers
of June 70 calls. The dealing in options encouraged selling of underlying
securities and the shares ended 2 lower at 72p on turnover of 4.2m. A total
of 1,719 Amstrad options changed hands, equivalent to more than 1.7m shares.
Speculation about a bid for Allied-Lyons boosted turnover in its options,
while the strong rally in the underlying securities prompted profit-taking
in the July 600 calls. A total of 1,604 Allied-Lyons options were traded.
The takeover talk surrounding Allied prompted a strong rise on the futures
market, the June FT-SE contract rising to a premium of more than 30 points
against the spot index.
With futures traders and equity marketmakers short, the rally prompted
active short-covering, which pushed the share market still higher.
The June FT-SE closed at 2,536, up 26 points on the day. June's premium to
the spot index finished at 30 points, against fair value of 15.

Wall Street
SHARE prices rose sharply in lively trading yesterday after the leading US
money centre banks quickly lowered their prime lending rates in the wake of
Tuesday's surprise discount rate cut by the Federal Reserve, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 42.33 stronger at 2,930.20, while
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced 4.94 to 380.29. The Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks, which had been on a steady decline since it set
several record closing highs last month, recovered from an Apple Computer
profits warning to end 3.13 ahead on the day at 487.85.
Turnover on the New York SE came to 182m shares, with the number of rising
stocks beating falling issues by 1,155 to 477.
Although the banks had been expected to lower their prime rates, the speed
with which they moved and the sight of bank loan rates dropping by 50 basis
points to 8 1/2 per cent gave the market something to cheer about. Investors
hope that cheaper borrowing costs will stimulate economic activity and help
bring the recession to an end before the final quarter of the year.
There was a muted reaction from bank shares to the prime rate reductions.
Citicorp edged up Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 15 7/8 , Manufacturers Hanover
firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 25 5/8 and Chase Manhattan added Dollars  1/4
at Dollars 18 3/4 , while Chemical Bank, Dollars 20 3/8 , and BankAmerica,
Dollars 38 1/2 , eased Dollars  1/8 apiece.
Elsewhere in the financial sector, securities house Salomon Bros rose
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 33 7/8 in spite of a warning from chairman Mr John
Gutfreund that the company could not guarantee that the earnings growth of
the first quarter would be maintained throughout the rest of the year. Given
the recent declines in share prices and the drop in daily turnover levels,
Mr Gutfreund's comments came as no surprise to the market.
A similar warning of tougher times ahead also failed to upset General
Dynamics, which put on Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 39 after the aerospace and
defence group was reported to have announced plans to shed 30 per cent of
its workforce over the next four years.
Chrysler completed the first-quarter earnings picture for the motor
industry, unveiling a net loss in the period of Dollars 598m, against net
profits of Dollars 71m for the same quarter in 1990. The figures were in
line with expectations, and the shares improved Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 13
1/2 .
On the over-the-counter market, Apple Computer plunged Dollars 7 3/4 to
Dollars 47 1/4 , or 14 per cent, on volume of almost 10m shares in the wake
of a warning from the company that third-quarter profits could be below the
figure achieved in 1990. Wall Street analysts promptly cut their earnings
estimates for Apple, and there was a knock-on effect for other technology
issues, most notably Commodore, down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 14 3/4 .
LTV, the diversified steel, aerospace and energy group, slipped Dollars  3/8
to Dollars 1 3/8 after announcing provisional plans for a reorganisation
designed to bring it out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
Canada
INTEREST RATE cuts in the US and Canada helped Toronto stocks to advance in
moderate trading. The Bank of Montreal cut its prime rate 1/4 point to 9.75
per cent, the first time the rate has dipped below 10 per cent since 1987.
The composite index moved forward 24.2 to close at 3,493.0, and rises
outnumbered declines by 303 to 237. Volume amounted to 21.3m shares.
Among the 14 sub-groups, 11 showed increases, led by mining, financial
services and industrial products, up 1.38 per cent, 1.10 per cent and 0.92
per cent respectively.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rallies as yen retreats
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONGER than expected US National Association of Purchasing Managers
Index helped to push the dollar up towards the top of the day's range at the
London close yesterday.
Trading was quiet, with most of the European centres closed for the May Day
holiday, and although the dollar finished on a firmer note it lost ground on
the day against the D-Mark and other members of the European exchange rate
mechanism.
The NAPM index for April was expected to be around 40.5 per cent, compared
with 40.0 in March, but it rose to 42.1 per cent. This encouraged hopes that
the US economy is about to recover, even though a figure below 50 per cent
indicates that manufacturing is generally declining.
In the Federal Reserve's latest survey of business activity, known as the
Beige Book, it said the economy remains weak in much of the US, but there
are signs that the recession may be bottoming out.
Retail sales are still sluggish in most districts, according to the survey,
and improved consumer confidence following the end of the Gulf war has yet
to be translated into solid sales.
The dollar touched a low of around DM1.6900, but by the London close had
rallied to DM1.7060, against DM1.7170 on Tuesday. It also declined to
SFr1.4445 from SFr1.4490 and to FFr5.7725 from FFr5.8025, but rose to
Y137.55 from Y136.30. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index was down
0.4 at 65.5.
The yen lost ground to the dollar and the D-Mark on speculation that the
Bank of Japan may soon cut its discount rate. Japanese officials, including
Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the finance minister, have indicated that there are no
plans to change monetary policy, but dealers suspect that the central bank
will act soon following this week's reduction in the US discount rate.
This contrasts with the belief that the German Bundesbank remains reluctant
to cut rates, even if the Fed's move makes it less likely that German rates
will be increased. The D-Mark climbed back above Y80.00 to close in London
at Y80.60 compared with Y79.40 previously.
Sterling was steady against the dollar but weaker against its partners in
the European exchange rate mechanism.
The European Commission in Brussels was closed for May Day, but unofficial
figures showed that the pound had fallen to second weakest member of the
ERM, from fourth strongest on Tuesday.
Sterling suffered from speculation that lower US rates have made a reduction
in UK bank base rates more likely. Trading was nervous ahead of today's
local government elections in England and Wales.
The pound rose to Dollars 1.7245 from Dollars 1.7240 and to Y237.25 from
Y235.00, but slipped to DM2.9425 from DM2.9600; to FFr9.9550 from
FFr10.0025; and to SFr2.4900 from SFr2.4975. Its index gained 0.2 to 91.6.
In New York, sterling eased 7 points to finish at Dollars 1.7238.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Politics and agriculture facing
up to growth in world appetite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of having half as many people again, in 30 years time, eating
at a world table that is wobbling all over the place is beginning to
concentrate wonderfully the minds of agriculturalists and politicians.
'By the year 2025 the world will have to feed an additional 3bn people from
a natural resource base which is already seriously threatened by
unsustainable farming practices and environmental pressures arising from
other human activities.'
So reads the opening sentence of the "Den Bosch Declaration" on sustainable
agriculture and rural developments, agreed last month in the Dutch town of
s-Hertogenbosch, at an international conference organised by the UN Food and
Agriculture Organisation and the government of the Netherlands.
Conviction appears to be widening that a great deal of farming in both
developed and developing countries is not sustainable and must change if
yields are to be maintained on a more permanent basis.
And although existing farming methods are producing enough food for the
world, millions cannot afford to buy what they need and are caught in a
poverty trap which forces them to eke out a living at the expense of natural
resources which are their sole means of survival.
The Bruntdtland Report 'Our Common Future' spoke of short sighted policies
which are leading to 'the degradation of the agricultural resource base on
almost every continent; soil erosion in North America, soil acidification in
Europe, deforestation and desertification in Asia, Africa and Latin
America.'
FAO estimates suggest between 5m to 7m hectares of arable land is lost each
year through soil degradation. The Worldwatch Institute, the Washington
based study group, says the annual loss of top soil is running at 24bn
tonnes, roughly equivalent to the amount on the Australian wheat lands. Soil
is also overworked in some areas, losing the nutrients which feed plants, as
little attention is paid to conservation measures.
Mr Edouard Saouma, FAO director-general, told participants at the conference
from 124 countries that the threat to the environment was intensified by
'indebtedness, unfavourable terms of trade and falling world prices for
export commodities'.
Agriculture will have to meet the challenges, says the Den Bosch
Declaration, 'mainly by increasing production on land already in use and by
avoiding further encroachment on land that is only marginally suitable'.
Changes are necessary to create the conditions of sustainability. 'This is
particularly the case in the rural areas with a high population density and
on marginal lands where small farmers and landless people can barely
subsist.'
The declaration was accompanied by an 'agenda for action' which urges the
study of diverse forms of agriculture including low external inputs and
organic farming systems. But it avoids the controversial issue as to whether
the use of chemical fertilisers increase the acidity of certain soils,
reducing their ability to sustain plant growth.
At a recent international conference on permaculture (permanent agriculture)
in Nepal, speakers pointed out that chemical fertilisers are increasing the
acidity of soils in mountainous areas, putting many farmers on a downward
spiral as far as crop yields are concerned.
This was leading to a growing interest among Nepali farmers in organic
methods such as intercropping, the use of green manures, planting trees and
crops on the same land and the integration of crops and livestock.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Government Bonds: Little movement as focus shifts to
refunding deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US GOVERNMENT bond prices firmed slightly at the long end of the market but
eased at the short end as a round of bank prime rate cuts and a spate of
economic statistics passed with little reaction.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up  1/16 at 96 9/32
, to yield 8.174 per cent. The two-year note was down  1/16 at 100 1/32 ,
yielding 6.795 per cent.
Analysts said the market's attention was fixed on the Treasury's quarterly
refunding package, scheduled for next week. Analysts are expecting the
Treasury to announce offerings worth Dollars 36bn, spread evenly between
three-year, 10-year and 30-year securities.
Bond dealers were unhappy that the Fed cut the discount rate on Tuesday,
just days before the quarterly refunding, because it pushed up bond prices.
Higher bond prices make the refunding exercise more costly for dealers and
investors, who would have preferred to see the Fed wait until after next
week's injection of fresh supply to cut rates.
However, analysts expect the offering to go well because of feeling that the
economy will take longer than envisaged to pull out of its recession.
Yesterday's economic data left little impression on the market. The Fed's
latest survey of the economy and the National Association of Purchasing
Managers' (NAPM) report for April revealed a slight improvement in economic
conditions, but showed the economy still firmly rooted in recession. Allied
to a small rise in the April leading indicators, the news suggested a
recovery was still a way off.
In the credit markets, the Fed intervened via overnight system repurchase
agreements to add reserves to the market and soften the Fed funds rate. The
Fed's operations initially had the desired effect, pushing Fed funds down
from an opening 6 per cent to 5 3/4 per cent, the target rate set by the
Fed, before firming later, to 5 7/8 .
UK GOVERNMENT bond prices firmed yesterday, although traders said the gilts
market was generally quiet ahead of today's local government elections. The
price of the benchmark gilt, the 11 3/4 gilt maturing in 2003/07, increased
by half a point from 110 1/32 to 110 17/32 .
The election results for 12,000 council seats in England and Wales will be
awaited eagerly as they are expected to provide an indication of the
government's popularity and how soon a general election will be called.
Traders said they expect the gilts market to bounce up once the local
elections are out of the way. Attention is then more likely to focus on the
April Retail Price Index, due on May 17, which is expected to show a fall in
inflation.
JAPANESE government bond prices rose on rumours that the Bank of Japan would
cut the Official Discount Rate, following the US Federal Reserve's example.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 government bond opened at 6.69 per cent in
Tokyo. It moved to a high of 6.645 per cent, and traded in London at around
6.65 per cent. Volumes were low as it is the Golden Week holiday in Japan.
EUROPEAN government bonds drifted up, reflecting optimism over the Fed's
discount rate cut. Most of the domestic markets were closed yesterday for
the May Day holiday, but trading in European bonds took place in London.
Traders reported further interest in buying shorter-dated German government
bonds, as fears of an interest rate increase have been dispelled for the
time being.
Interest in the Dutch bond market - which stayed open - focused on the new
8.5 per cent 15-year state bond tap. The capital markets agency of the Dutch
finance ministry set the tap issue price for the 8.50 per cent state bond
due 2006 at 99.6 to yield 8.55 per cent. The price on Monday was 99.40.

EASTMAN KODAK, the world's biggest producer of photographic products,
yesterday unveiled disappointing first-quarter earnings in spite of improved
sales.
Net earnings fell 11 per cent to Dollars 178m, or 55 cents a share, from
Dollars 199m, or 61 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 8 per cent in the
quarter to Dollars 4.4bn from Dollars 4.1bn.
Kodak said its 1991 figures include an additional two months of sales from
its Sterling Drug units outside the US. The 1990 results include revenues
from discontinued operations.
Wall Street registered its disappointment with the results by marking
Kodak's shares Dollars 1 1/4 lower at Dollars 40 1/2 by the close in a
market that was generally higher.
Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman and chief executive, said there some highlights in
the latest quarter including better-than-expected results from Kodak's
chemical business and strong international demand for Kodacolor film and
Ektacolor paper.
Looking ahead for the rest of the year, Kodak expects continued gains in
sales and margin recovery later in the year, assuming the economy improves.

The move ends a month of speculation about who would succeed Mr Frank

Mr Tartikoff, 42, has been employed by NBC, a unit of General Electric,

FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: LTV unveils restructuring plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LTV, the third largest US steel manufacturer, yesterday unveiled a plan
aimed at paving the way for it to emerge from the protection of the
bankruptcy courts - but the package immediately ran into strong criticism
from its creditors.
The company estimates that its unsecured creditors will be paid a maximum of
only 25 per cent of their claims, while LTV pays large amounts of available
funds to its largest creditor, the Federal Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation.
The official LTV Steel Creditors' Committee said it believed the plan
substantially overestimated the amounts creditors might recover and also
meant a 'grossly unfair' allocation in favour of the PBGC and the company's
pension plans.
LTV sought Chapter 11 protection in 1986, when the US steel industry was in
the throes of a severe shake-out. It was weighed down by underfunded pension
liabilities and high debt and health care costs.
A restructuring programme has been delayed by a long-running dispute with
the FBGC, the US pension insurance agency, over payment for LTV's pension
liabilities. But a breakthrough agreement between the two sides was achieved
in February, clearing the way for yesterday's announcement by LTV of its
first restructuring proposal.
Under the pensions deal, LTV would contribute Dollars 880m in cash and
assets to three pension funds and from 1993 would make annual fixed payments
of Dollars 100m, plus 50 per cent of available cash flow above that figure.
The agency's claims total over Dollars 2.3bn.
LTV would raise Dollars 300m in new cash as part of the initial Dollars 880m
and is considering asset sales to meet this commitment.
Secured creditors would get 100 cents on the dollar but unsecured creditors
would only get up to a quarter of their claims, and would be paid in new
common stock. Current holders of common and preferred stock would also
receive new paper, in the ratio of 1.11 new shares for each 100 previously
owned. The company estimates the value of the new stock at Dollars 1bn to
Dollars 1.25bn.

TRAVELERS, the multi-line insurer which startled Wall Street last autumn
when it made large provisions for potential losses on its property
investment interests, yesterday reported static first-quarter profits, at
Dollars 93.1m. The figure for the first three months of 1990 was Dollars
91.6m.
The company said the property market 'in most parts of the country continued
to deteriorate' and it did not expect any stabilisation until the economy
picked up generally. It also warned that pricing levels in the commercial
property-casualty market - its biggest area of business  - remained soft.
But, notwithstanding these problems, Travelers added that the first-quarter
results had met the group's expectations. On the stock market, Travelers
shares gained Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 24 1/4 .
The latest profits figure compared with net income of Dollars 92m a year
earlier. Earnings per share amounted to 88 cents, against 87 cents.
The figures include net realised investment losses of Dollars 2.4m, against
a profit of Dollars 5.2m in 1990. But this was largely offset by a Dollars
7.3m (nil) extraordinary credit. Excluding these two factors, profits
totalled Dollars 88.2m against Dollars 86.4m.
On the commercial property-casualty side, net profits were Dollars 42.5m,
against Dollars 42.2m, after realised investment losses of Dollars 8.6m
compared with a Dollars 200,000 deficit last time.
It said premiums fell from Dollars 833m to Dollars 731m.

CANADA'S Reichmann family, which controls large property and natural
resources investments, could raise more than CDollars 1bn (USDollars 860m)
from the sale of energy-related companies.
A court ruling earlier this week allows the division of the Calgary-based
Interhome Energy into two parts - Home Oil, an oil and gas producer, and
Interprovincial Pipe Line, Canada's biggest oil pipeline operator. Both
companies are controlled by GW Utilities, in which the Reichmanns have an 89
per cent stake.
GWU said it has been approached by potential buyers for its shares in both
Home and Interprovincial. But Mr Jim Doak, analyst at First Marathon
Securities, said that the sale of Home will be complicated by its debt load.

<TEXT>
McCAW CELLULAR Communications, the leading company in the fast-growing US
cellular telephone market, yesterday reported a first-quarter net loss of
Dollars 169.1m but said it was producing continued growth in revenue, cash
flow and numbers of subscribers.
The company has assumed large debts to fund its rapid expansion and its
bottom line results are expected to remain in the red for a considerable
time to come.
The first quarter's loss, which translated into a per share figure of 97
cents, compared with net income of Dollars 851.9m, or Dollars 4.93 a share,
in the first quarter of last year. However, that profit was due to its
Dollars 1.2bn sale of southeastern US markets to rival Contel.
McCaw said comparisons between the two periods were also affected by the
increased interest expense incurred in last year's takeover of 52 per cent
of Lin Broadcasting, another large cellular company, and the acquisition of
Metromedia's interest in the New York cellular licence. Lin's results have
been consolidated since March 5 last year.
McCaw said its first quarter revenues rose 56 per cent to Dollars 293.4m,
while cash flow increased from Dollars 36.2m to Dollars 89.5m, and the
number of McCaw/Lin cellular subscribers rose 47 per cent to 1.26m. Income
from operations was Dollars 800,000 against a loss of Dollars 16.5m.

after profits warning

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
APPLE Computer's stock price plunged again yesterday when the company said
it expected an earnings decline in the current third fiscal quarter as a
result of exchange rate changes and the higher proportion of low-priced
computers it is selling.
Apple said its earnings may be below those for the third quarter of 1990
when net income was Dollars 119m, or 96 cents a share, on sales of Dollars
1.4bn. Analysts had projected earnings of around Dollars 1.18 a share for
the current quarter.
The announcement precipitated a 13 per cent decline in Apple's share from a
Tuesday close of Dollars 55 to Dollars 47 1/4 by the close yesterday.
The share price fall followed a similar decline two weeks ago when
disappointing second-quarter results were revealed. In all, Apple's shares
have lost one-third of their value in the past two weeks amid concerns about
the earnings outlook.
In the second quarter, Apple raised 52 per cent of its revenues outside the
US. The rising value of the dollar against foreign currencies will, however,
reduce the profitability of these overseas sales in the current quarter, the
company acknowledged.
Apple said demand for its Macintosh personal computers remained strong, but
profit margins were under pressure. In addition to declining currency
exchange rates, Apple's profit margins have been reduced by its introduction
of a range of lower-priced Macintosh personal computers last year.
'Clearly, we are succeeding at our overriding business objective: we are
attracting new users to the Macintosh platform and increasing our share of
the personal computer market,' said Mr Joseph A. Graziano, Apple's chief
financial officer.

FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: Tele-Communications in Dollars
1bn United Artists bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TELE-COMMUNICATIONS, the biggest operator of US cable television systems,
yesterday offered to acquire the remaining 46 per cent of United Artists
Entertainment it does not own in a deal valued at more than Dollars 1bn.
United Artists Entertainment, a cable television and cinema group formed in
1989 when United Artists merged with United Cable Television in a Dollars
1.3bn deal, said the acquisition would be structured as a tax-free merger.
United Artists' common shares would be exchanged for class A common shares
of Tele-Communications, and United Artists' outstanding preferred stock
would be converted into comparable preferred stock to be issued by
Tele-Communications.
United Artists' outstanding common stock would be converted into 0.95 of a
share of Tele-Communications class A.
Tele-Communications also plans to begin a Dollars 4 3/4 cash tender offer
for each outstanding right issued at the time of the merger between United
Artists and United Cable. Tele-Communications acquired its controlling stake
in United Artists in 1986.
United Artists A shares added Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 14 3/4 while
Tele-Communications A issues closed Dollars  1/4 lower at Dollars 15 3/4 .
Mr Edward Hatch, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute, described the move
as a pre-emptive measure by Tele-Communications to acquire the remainder of
UAE before its share price moves much higher.

FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: L'Oreal seeks to keep its gloss
 -The cosmetics group faces rising competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR decades, L'Oreal has dominated the international cosmetics industry from
its headquarters in Paris. Today, its position is under attack.
L'Oreal still makes more lipsticks, mascaras and skin creams than any other
company, but competition is intensifying. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer
goods group, has increased its cosmetics interests.
Shiseido and Kao, the giant Japanese cosmetics companies, are diversifying
into the West. Last month, Procter &amp; Gamble of the US became the French
company's closest competitor in international cosmetics, buying Max Factor
and Betrix from Revlon for Dollars 1.1bn.
Mr Lindsay Owen-Jones, the 44-year-old Welshman who has chaired L'Oreal
since 1988, appears to be unabashed. 'Of course we recognise P&amp;G and the
rest as formidable competitors,' he said, 'but we have always lived with
competition. Life in this industry should be very interesting over the next
few years.'
So far, L'Oreal shows no signs of suffering from increased competition. Last
week, it announced a 15 per cent increase in net profits to FFr1.69bn for
1990 on sales up 12.5 per cent on a comparable basis to FFr30.4bn.
Given that 1990 was a difficult year for the cosmetics industry - notably in
the US where the financial plight of the department stores, the main
distribution channel for upmarket products, aggravated the problems of
recession - Mr Owen-Jones has every reason to seem sanguine.
This year seems set to be even more difficult. The impact of the Gulf war on
international travel and the duty-free market created chaos in January and
February. Mr Owen-Jones said L'Oreal's sales rose by just 5.5 per cent in
the first quarter. However, the market has recovered in April and he hopes
to achieve double digit growth in sales and profits for the full year.
Conditions ought to improve in the longer term. The underlying trends of an
ageing population and the drive towards higher-quality products augur well
for a company like L'Oreal, which makes Lancome skin creams, Helena
Rubinstein cosmetics and Ambre Solaire sun screen.
However, Mr Owen-Jones expects slower growth in the 1990s than in the
bullish era of the 1980s.
Slower growth is only one of the challenges confronting L'Oreal. It may face
mounting legislation over cosmetics product claims in both the US and
Europe. It must also come to terms with pressure from environmentalists on
packaging and product testing. L'Oreal, which spent FFr100m over the past 10
years on researching alternative forms of testing, is already a target for
animal rights protesters.
But the dominant issue on the agenda is the expansion of P&amp;G and Unilever.
In the past, L'Oreal had the advantage of being one of the very few
cosmetics companies to have both the research resources for dynamic product
development programmes and the critical mass to exploit its research through
economies of scale in production.
P&amp;G and Unilever not only have research and production resources on the same
scale, they also have the benefit of good rapport with the supermarkets and
drug stores that are increasingly important channels of distribution.
L'Oreal is battling back by maximising its own resources. Mr Owen-Jones
still sees research as the backbone of the business. L'Oreal, which was
founded by a chemist, spends at least 5 per cent of sales on research and
development. Shiseido, by contrast, spends 3 per cent.
The group has also boosted marketing expenditure. It refuses to disclose
budgets, but new products, such as Tresor, the Lancome fragrance, have been
treated to lavish launch campaigns.
Mr Owen-Jones is dismissive of the 'quick fix' acquisitions of his
competitors, but L'Oreal has conducted some acquisitions of its own. Its
most important test will come later this year with the relaunch of Helena
Rubinstein, which was taken over two years ago.
L'Oreal has rationalised Rubinstein's manufacturing and is now in the final
stages of overhauling its products. It is doing the same to the Lanvin
perfumes which it owns through its Orcofi joint venture.
L'Oreal's own ownership seems secure even in the acquisitive world of
cosmetics. It is controlled by Gesparal, which is 51 per cent owned by Mrs
Liliane Bettencourt, the daughter of L'Oreal's founder who is now in her
late 60s. Nestle, the Swiss food group, owns the rest of Gesparal and has
rights over Mrs Bettencourt's stake in an agreement which runs until 1994.

FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Midland sells Australian offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND BANK is selling Dominguez Barry Samuel Montagu, its Australian
merchant banking business, to Swiss Bank Corporation.
Swiss Bank will buy a 60 per cent interest, with the re-mainder being bought
by DBSM management and employees.
The Australian bank employs 260 people and has total assets of ADollars 409m
(Pounds 183.41m). It made ADollars 13.4m before tax in 1990.
No price was revealed for the sale, but it is believed to have brought
Midland a premium over DBSM's net asset value, which was ADollars 24m at the
end of 1989.
Midland stressed that DBSM is a successful business, but the sale was part
of its strategy of divesting itself of non-core activities outside Europe.
Swiss Bank Corporation said that the acquisition would enable it to expand
its international investment banking presence.
Midland is combining its French corporate finance activities in a company,
Samuel Montagu France, with a capital of FFr2.25m (Pounds 225,027). The
activities were previously separated into Samuel Montagu and the Midland
Bank.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Starmin, the quarry products company formerly known as SI Group, has
achieved its first profits since 1984 and has rejoined the dividend list in
the year to end-December.
The company, run since October 1989 by brothers Osman and Raschid Abdullah,
reported taxable profits of Pounds 764,000 for 1990, against a Pounds 1.22m
loss in the comparable period on sales up 72 per cent to Pounds 8.8m (Pounds
5.12m).
A dividend of 0.1p is recommended for the year on earnings per share of 0.5p
(losses of 3.4p). At the year-end shareholders' funds stood at Pounds 13.7m
(Pounds 1.72m) and borrowings at Pounds 1.47m represented gearing of 10.7
per cent.
The company has focused operations on Scotland and the A1 corridor.
The acquisition near the year-end of quarries in Scotland and an option on a
Derbyshire site involved the issue of 6.67m shares plus Pounds 250,000 cash.

<TEXT>
SHILOH, the textile spinner, healthcare and protective clothing group,
suffered a Pounds 440,948 setback in profits to Pounds 659,383 pre-tax for
the year to end-March.
Spinning profits fell significantly. Directors blamed the erosion of margins
here on competition from subsidised imports.
Group turnover expanded from Pounds 16.28m to Pounds 18.97m - healthcare and
protective clothing now account for over 50 per cent of sales.
Earnings fell to 7.98p (12.52p). A final dividend of 1.75p makes a 5.125p
(2.625p) total.
However, 2.5p of the past year's dividend was a special payment arising from
profits from the sale of land.

FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Christies Intl raises client loans to
Pounds 16m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN

<TEXT>
CHRISTIES International, the auction house, is lending more money to people
whose possessions it is in the process of selling.
Notes to the accounts show that year-end advances to consignors nearly
quadrupled from Pounds 4.17m to Pounds 15.7m.
Mr Tyler confirmed that the increase was a trend and that the year-end
snapshot was 'not too unrepresentative. But don't imagine that the figure is
going to multiply by four each year,' he said. Christies charges 'a
commercial rate of interest' on the sums advanced.
Despite the increase, Christies' year-end inventory of debtors tumbled by a
third to Pounds 173.68m (Pounds 260.98m). This was principally due to a
sharp fall to Pounds 140.51m (Pounds 244.49m) in monies owed by purchasers,
reflecting the downturn in business.
Christies' 1990 pre-tax profits fell by 36 per cent to Pounds 43.09m (Pounds
66.94m) on turnover down 13 per cent to Pounds 167.77m (Pounds 192.14m).
The accounts also show that Lord Carrington, chairman, last year received a
13 per cent pay rise to Pounds 165,000. The salary of the highest paid
director rose from Pounds 190,000 to Pounds 226,000.

FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Bioplan calls for Pounds 23m to complete
three hospitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIOPLAN Holdings, the USM-quoted healthcare company, has launched a Pounds
22.8m rights issue to reduce debt and complete three hospitals.
The 2-for-1 issue of 296.2m shares at 8p each, 2p less than yesterday's
close, comes just over a year after Bioplan joined the USM, via a reverse
takeover of Cooks Industries accompanied by a Pounds 14.3m rights issue.
Mr Peter Townsend, chairman and newly-appointed chief executive, said the
three new hospitals would bring the total spent in three year to Pounds 42m.
All 11 hospitals operate in partnership with the National Health Service.
Debt at the March year-end was Pounds 17m, giving gearing of more than 80
per cent. After the issue, fully underwritten by Smith New Court, debt would
be wiped out.
Pre-tax profit for the 15 months to March 31 increased to Pounds 1.5m
(Pounds 370,000 in 12 months) on turnover of Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 4.9m).
Fully diluted earnings per share were 0.77p (losses 0.73p).
The healthcare side made a Pounds 2.5m operating profit, while office
furniture - a Cooks remnant that is about to be sold to management - lost
Pounds 200,000. Interest costs were Pounds 720,000 (Pounds 40,000).
The write-down of an investment and provisions against Cooks businesses
incurred extraordinary charges of Pounds 750,000. After resumed dividend
payments - the final is 0.1p - the retained loss was Pounds 550,000 (loss of
Pounds 2.4m).

SOUTH Audley Management, the private investment vehicle owned by family
trusts of Mr Asil Nadir, chairman of Polly Peck International, yesterday
defeated a petition for its compulsory winding-up.
The petition had been brought by Mr Christopher Morris, one of the
administrators of Polly Peck International, over a debt of Pounds 14,111
owed to the fresh fruit to electronics group.
Mr Morris's petition followed earlier attempts by the South Audley directors
themselves to put the group into voluntary liquidation, with their own
choice of liquidator. Mr Morris's petition, had it been successful, would
have put the company into the hands of the official receiver.

<TEXT>
FENNER, the diversified Hull-based manufacturing and distribution group,
yesterday announced an abrupt end to a period of sustained growth with
pre-tax profits nearly halved from Pounds 7.26m to Pounds 3.71m for the
first half of 1990/91.
The shares fell 4p to 132p underlining the severity and suddenness of the
recession which hit UK heavy manufacturing last autumn. Profits in the year
1989/90 rose 21 per cent to Pounds 16.1m, but analysts now expect the total
for the current year to be about Pounds 8.5m-Pounds 9m.
Turnover for the first half slipped from Pounds 102.5m to Pounds 100.5m.
The interim dividend is held at 3.45p. Mr Peter Barker, chairman, said this
reflected the strengths of the businesses. Fenner has cut 350 jobs, or some
15% of its workforce, in the current year. This would be reflected by a
Pounds 6m provision.
On the outlook, Mr Barker said 'signs are apparent that demand levels are
now stabilising,' but the economic recovery widely forecast for the latter
part of 1991 was unlikely to come in time to influence the outcome in the
current year.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Olympia &amp; York 'resilient' says credit rating agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CANADIAN credit-rating agency has concluded that the financial condition
of Reichmann-controlled Olympia &amp; York Developments - which has interests in
London's Docklands - remains resilient despite some severe setbacks to its
vast property and natural resources investments.
O&amp;Y, involved in London's Canary Wharf development, has seen the market
value of its listed investments fall 18 per cent in the past year. The group
has taken a hard knock from the property slump in New York, London and
Toronto.
But the Toronto-based Dominion Bond Rating Service said in a report to
clients yesterday that O&amp;Y appeared to have adequate equity to support its
debt. Furthermore, it said that some of the Reichmanns' holdings in listed
companies could probably be sold at a 25 to 30 per cent premium to their
market value of CDollars 5.4bn (Pounds 2.75bn).
These holdings include an 82 per cent stake in newsprint-maker
Abitibi-Price, and a 35 per cent interest in Trizec, North America's biggest
listed property developer.
In reviewing one of O&amp;Y's commercial paper programmes, the rating agency
concluded that 'whatever O&amp;Y's credit strength was one year ago, it is
weaker today. Nonetheless, it is still strong enough to maintain (its)
rating', equivalent to a double A.
O&amp;Y is a private company, and Dominion emphasised that it had never seen the
group's financial statements. The agency's report was drawn up in
consultation with O&amp;Y executives, including Mr Paul Reichmann, the family's
master strategist.
On Canary Wharf, O&amp;Y told the rating agency that signed leases and deals
'close to completion' cover almost 3m of the 4.7m sq ft that will become
available over the next 18 months.
According to O&amp;Y, 'there has been a substantial increase in tenant interest
now that full visual impact has become apparent'.
The Reichmanns predict that up to 85 per cent of the space will be committed
by the time the first tenants move in.
However, the agency's report expressed several concerns about O&amp;Y's property
exposure in New York, where it is the biggest office landlord, and in London
and Toronto.
The concerns include these cities' heavy reliance on the financial services
industry, and a concentration of tenants in its portfolio.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Bank of Scotland calls for Pounds 194.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Scotland took advantage of a buoyant stock market yesterday to
ask its shareholders for Pounds 194.4m.
The rights issue by the Edinburgh-based institution is the first from the
hard-pressed UK banking sector in two and a half years. The move was seen as
the beginning of the rebuilding process.
Mr Bruce Pattullo, chief executive of the Bank of Scotland, said he took a
positive view of the prospects for the UK banking market, and he believed
this was the moment to seek capital for expansion.
The issue will be on the basis of three for 10 at a price of 87p. This
compares with the closing price of 131p on Tuesday evening. Yesterday, the
shares gained 5p to close at 136p, reflecting the market's positive view of
the Scottish bank, which is ranked among the best managed. Standard Life,
the Edinburgh insurance company which owns 33.3 per cent of the bank, has
pledged its support for the capital-raising, which was fully underwritten by
Cazenove, the stockbrokers.
The rights issue announcement accompanied the Bank of Scotland's results for
the year ending February 28. These showed a sharp fall in profits because of
the impact of the UK recession and mounting loan losses. At the pre-tax
level, the bank earned Pounds 134m, down from Pounds 193.5m the year before.
This was the bank's first profits downturn in seven years. However, Mr
Pattullo stressed two positive developments which justified the rights
issue. One was the steady increase in market share which the Bank of
Scotland was achieving through its strategy of selective expansion in
England. The second was the widening of margins on lending business that was
occurring as other banks pulled in their horns.
'Our whole delivery system is geared to winning market share,' he said. 'In
the future, this business will have higher margins.'
He emphasised that the Bank of Scotland saw itself growing organically
rather than by acquisition, and he said the rights had been planned without
any specific purchase in mind.
The Bank of Scotland also announced yesterday that it was capitalising half
its revaluation reserve through a one-for-five issue, which would add a
further Pounds 38m to its core capital.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Citicorp to sell 50% of Ambac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP, the leading US commercial bank which has been seeking to bolster
its capital base recently, is planning to sell just over 50 per cent of its
Ambac, municipal bond insurance business, through a public offering.
The bank filed a registration statement, related to the offering, with the
US Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday. It confirmed that it
expects proceeds from the sale to amount to Dollars 500m (Pounds 290m).
The move comes at a time when Citicorp has been attempting to boost its
capital base and clean up a Dollars 2bn portfolio of non-performing
commercial real estate loans.
Last month, it sold Dollars 660m of convertible preferred stock to
investors.
Weeks earlier, the bank had received a slightly smaller infusion when a
Saudi Arabian prince agreed to subscribe for another Dollars 590m-worth of
convertible stock.
Yesterday, Citicorp said that the Ambac share sale was part of the same
strategy.
An improvement in the capital position by early 1993 was being sought via 'a
variety of market transactions, including the sale of non-strategic assets'.
Ambac, which provides default insurance on bonds issued by states and
municipalities, is currently wholly-owned by Citicorp. It is one of the
three main primary insurers in the field, the others being MBIA and
Financial Guaranty Insurance.
Accordingly to a recent study by Fitch Investors Services, Ambac's market
share was around 21 per cent in 1990, when it insured Dollars 11.3bn of
bonds, at par value.
Yesterday, Citicorp said that a main benefit of the sale would be the effect
on its 'tier one' capital ratio.
It calculates that around Dollars 25bn of assets - essentially insurance in
force, adjusted by various other considerations - will be removed from the
calculation. This would make the effect of the transaction on the tier one
capital ratio roughly equivalent to a Dollars 1bn capital infusion.
The bank, which acquired Ambac back in 1985, had been trying to sell Ambac
to a single buyer, but has now decided that a share offering is more
attractive.
The offering envisages a two-tier share structure for Ambac, so that
Citicorp's initial ongoing voting interest would only be around 20 per cent.

FT  02 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Sound Diffusion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The accountancy debates of the 1980s are obviously going to rumble on into
the 1990s. The issues behind accounting for leasing profits are so
complicated that one could write a book on them; indeed at 255 pages, the
DTI inspectors of Sound Diffusion have. But shareholders must feel that if
there can be such wide disagreement between inspectors and two leading firms
of auditors, they have little hope of keeping track. Given the 1980s'
problems in the computer leasing sector, leasing companies are not likely to
be too welcome on the stock market for a while. It is perhaps unsurprising
that GPA is private.
In the circumstances, one can feel more than a twinge of sympathy for the
two non-executive directors, Mr Macdonald and Mr Howard, brought in to sort
out the complicated mess and ending up only with brickbats from the
inspectors for their pains. The criticisms may well re-open the issue of
whether inspectors should be allowed to be so trenchant. And given that the
report took two years to complete, only to conclude that no single factor
was responsible for the group's failure, the taxpayer might wonder whether
the expense of these investigations is justified.

FT  02 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Buy-outs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MFI's debt rescheduling and Tuesday's Pounds 108m deal for Devro will
doubtless revive bitter-sweet memories of a bygone age. The furniture
group's buy-out will probably go down as one of the worst-timed transactions
of its kind; the Scottish sausage skin company's spin-off from Johnson and
Johnson will be seen as a hopeful sign that the market may shortly splutter
back into life.
That is almost certainly an optimistic view. It is true that small deals
involving funds of Pounds 10m to Pounds 20m are still being done. But the
huge buy-outs which were such a feature of the late 1980s - MFI, Magnet,
Isosceles - have all but dried up. The problem is not a shortage of equity,
for there are funds aplenty eagerly seeking out opportunities to invest. The
reason for the low level of activity is the newly-cautious attitude of the
banks. As in other areas of lending, they have drawn in their horns, alarmed
in this case by the dozen or so buy-outs which have gone into receivership
in the last year (equivalent to 6 per cent of the total funds invested in
buy-outs since records began). Whereas the average deal in the half year to
December 1989 involved one part equity to six parts mezzanine finance and
debt, the average ratio during the second half of last year was just one to
two.
Though none of the 20 most highly-leveraged bids of the 1980s has yet
failed, there is every reason to applaud more conservative structures after
the excesses of the recent past. But the irony is that - for buy-outs, at
any rate - the pendulum has probably swung too far the other way.

FT  02 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Scottish banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Scotland has made something of a habit of rights issues, without
ever meeting the positive reception accorded yesterday's Pounds 194m call.
But the successful issue and 12 per cent dividend increase, timed to
coincide with what the bank hopes is the bottom of the economic cycle, will
probably not act as an incentive for other clearing banks thinking about
propping up their ailing capital ratios. Despite the unfortunate symmetry of
the Pounds 202m of bad debt provisions in its full-year figures, Bank of
Scotland knows it can tell a better story than its competitors. The contrast
with the rights issues in recent years by Midland, Standard Chartered, or
for that matter Barclays, is obvious.
The market believes Bank of Scotland will make good use of the rights
proceeds despite a slide in second-half profits which augurs badly for the
first six months of this financial year. It is probably right. The loan book
expanded by a fifth last year and will grow again this year by more than 10
per cent as it uses its strengthened capital position to pursue the
higher-margin business now available. Underlying profits were respectable
enough to justify the dividend increase; yet more reason for the other banks
to be envious.
As for the Royal Bank of Scotland, its performance was slightly more typical
of the sector. The maintained interim dividend simply emphasised how much it
over-estimated the outlook by raising its final payment nearly 17 per cent
last November.

FT-SE Index: 2,508.4 (+22.2)
London rose obediently in response to Wall Street's welcome for the April
purchasing managers' report, which came in above expectations. On Monday,
the Chicago purchasing managers, usually read as a leading indicator for the
big one, fell; but the national reading rose for the third successive month.
There is a message here, but it may not be quite the one London is reading.
The main industrial news in the US is that car output is rising - witness
the very bullish Michigan report, now showing a positive balance of 25 per
cent. This was bound to happen; output was some 20 per cent below even the
depressed level of sales, which has so far recovered only marginally.
Housing is just off the bottom, but is unlikely to rise much above it. The
rest of the construction scene is dismal.
In the words of the new Beige Book, activity is weak, but there are some
signs of bottoming out. Wall Street comment is rather more bearish about the
economy, but likes lower rates and a falling dollar. Modified rapture.
The question for UK investors is how much any US delight should influence
views on this side of the water. A British turnaround is still the subject
of speculation, margins are being squeezed, the currency is uncomfortably
strong and stuck. Higher output in Detroit means little in London. We march
with Wall Street, say the brokers; but recently they have only been
following it upwards. The Dow is still 3 per cent off its peak; after
yesterday London is very near the top.

FT  02 MAY 91 / US banks cut prime rates to 8 1/2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BIG US banks cut their prime lending rates by half a point to 8 1/2 per cent
yesterday amid mildly encouraging economic news and a prediction by Mr
Michael Boskin, chief White House economist, that 'the economy is about to
turn around'.
The reduction in the benchmark lending rate, led by Morgan Guaranty, the New
York bank, came in quick response to Tuesday's easing of monetary policy by
the Federal Reserve when it cut the discount rate by half a percentage point
to 5 1/2 per cent.
President George Bush reiterated his view that the recession would be
neither long nor deep. He said falling interest rates would stimulate
growth.
The cut in prime rates, the third in the past year, should reduce the cost
of many consumer and corporate loans.
The banks' move was appreciated on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average closed 42.33 points higher at 2,930.20. Bond prices and the dollar
were also firmer.
The White House was cheered by several economic reports released yesterday.
The latest 'Beige Book' - the Fed's regional survey of economic trends -
said activity remained weak in much of the nation but there were 'some
indications that the decline may be bottoming out'.
The survey noted stable or improving conditions in manufacturing industry in
many areas and pointed to signs of revival in residential real estate
markets.
The Commerce Department said the composite index of leading indicators - the
main guide to future turning points in the economy - rose 0.5 per cent in
March to register its second consecutive monthly increase. Index rises
usually precede economic recoveries by about three months.
Indicators measuring the industrial economy's strength, however, continued
to point to recession.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Dress rehearsal at the local hustings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOTERS GO to the polls in local elections across England and Wales today
with both main parties reconciled to a hotly disputed outcome.
With the voting widely billed as a dress rehearsal for the general election
that must be held within 15 months, both Labour and Conservative officials
were yesterday already disputing how various possible results might be
interpreted.
After their strong showing in local polls four years ago, some Tories
claimed that the loss of up to 200 seats might be a sufficiently positive
outcome to justify Mr John Major, the prime minister, seeking a fresh
mandate in June.
Labour argued that the distribution of its anticipated gains would be
crucial. Gaining marginal seats could show it to be on course for outright
victory in a general election.
Party officials dismissed a computer analysis published at the weekend
purporting to show that the party required total gains of 700 council seats
to be sure of a comfortable Commons majority.
As speculation mounts about the election date, the balloting in more than
12,000 council seats in 475 constituencies will be minutely analysed by the
parties.
Although no voting will take place in Scotland or London, strong
Conservative showings at similar local elections in 1983 and 1987 persuaded
the government to go quickly to the country. On both occasions, the Tories
were rewarded with big majorities.
This time politicians of all parties believe the Conservatives are highly
unlikely to do well enough for Mr Major to risk calling an immediate poll.
Concern about the economy, two recent by-election defeats and continuing
debate on the reform of the poll tax have left the Tories braced to lose a
substantial number of the 5,200 council seats won in 1987.
Opinion polls show Labour level-pegging with the government on about 40 per
cent of the vote, up from 31 per cent in 1987, and a near halving of the
Liberal Democrats' support to about 14 per cent.
If the Tories do better, as commonly expected, a final decision on an early
general election in June will await the outcome of the Monmouth by-election,
due on May 15, where the party is defending a 9,500 majority.
One Labour official said yesterday: 'A crucial factor will be how the old
(Social Democrat-Liberal) Alliance votes go, with us hoping for them to get
a rising vote in the south and a falling one in the north.'
Analysts will pay special attention to cities such as Nottingham, where a
council split equally between the two parties reflects similar wafer-thin
majorities in three crucial parliamentary seats.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Charities suffer drop in income, says survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF Britain's large charities have experienced a drop in income during
the past six months, according to Mr Michael Brophy, director of the
Charities Aid Foundation.
The foundation, which provides the main basis of statistical information
about charities in Britain, yesterday published the full results of its
1989-90 charity household survey. It concludes that it is 'highly unlikely'
that there has been any real increase in individual charitable giving over
the period 1987-90.
According to the survey, 26 per cent of respondents had given nothing to
charity in the month before interview. Most of those who had made any
donation gave relatively little, with nearly half contributing Pounds 1 or
less. Only 17 per cent gave Pounds 10 or more.
The evidence of declining public support for charity comes when financial
pressures on local authorities mean that many are also experiencing cuts in
public finance.
In London, a financial crisis facing the voluntary sector has been made
worse by a decision of Ealing council to withdraw its support from a
proposed Pounds 29m budget to fund the capital's voluntary organisations.
The council's finance committee had endorsed the budget - breaking political
deadlock on the London Boroughs Grants Committee which distributes the
funding - but this was reversed by the full council.
Many of the capital's voluntary organisations face closure.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Ex-takeover chief criticised: DTI attacks accountancy firms
over Sound Diffusion collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry report has sharply criticised Mr David
Macdonald, a former director-general of the Takeover Panel, and the
accountancy firms Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur Young, now merged as Ernst &amp;
Young.
The report concerns the collapse of Sound Diffusion, an electrical equipment
leasing company, which went into receivership in December 1988, eight months
after launching a Pounds 9.5m rights issue.
The inspectors say Mr Macdonald, chairman of the company from December 1987
to December 1988, and fellow non-executive director Mr Francis Howard:
'failed to ensure that the reasons for the rights issue were sufficiently
stated';
'should not have been party to the wording in the (rights issue) document to
the effect that the problems of the past were behind the company when they
should have known this was not the case.'
The inspectors say that Mr Macdonald made an interim announcement in October
1988 which they feel 'gave a misleading impression of the company's
profitability and prospects'.
The report says Ernst &amp; Whinney (sole auditor between August 1985 and
October 1987) and Arthur Young (sole auditor subsequently) 'either failed to
identify or otherwise accepted serious defects in the company's accounting
practices and did not adequately audit the amount receivable under finance
leases' - the company's principal asset.
The report concludes that Sound Diffusion's accounts took too optimistic a
view of the likely profitability of many of its leases. However, the
inspectors say that 'in our view, no single factor or person was responsible
for the failure.'
Mr Macdonald said that the inspectors' conclusions on lease accounting were
'at odds with what the leasing experts in two leading firms of accountants
had concluded'.
Ernst &amp; Young expressed surprise 'that the inspectors believe that the
accounting policies were a contributory factor to the failure of Sound
Diffusion. The significant accounting issues arising out of the report turn
on a difference of opinion between the inspectors and of the two sets of
auditors involved as to the application of a new accounting standard. . .
.we. . . .believe that the policies adopted were appropriate.'

FT  02 MAY 91 / BR will back Channel link to King's Cross
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL is expected to recommend today the construction of a high-speed
rail route from the Channel tunnel through south-east London to King's Cross
station in north London.
The decision is likely to prompt hostile reaction from local authorities and
other groups in south London which have been fighting the high-speed route
on environmental grounds.
The route chosen is likely to be similar to that proposed last year by
European Rail Link, a joint venture between BR, Trafalgar House and BICC.
The Pounds 2.6bn scheme was rejected by the government after it refused to
provide financial assistance for what would have been a largely privately
funded project.
Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, however, told the Commons in December
that the government had not ruled out using public money. This could be
provided either in the form of loan financing or capital grants from Network
SouthEast to improve commuter services.
BR's board of directors meets today to finalise its recommendation that a
high speed link should pass through Kent and south-east London.
The board's choice will be conveyed by Sir Bob Reid, BR's chairman, to Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, who will make the final decision on
whether the link goes ahead.
BR was asked by the Transport Department to reconsider the project after the
European Rail Link scheme was abandoned.
The construction of a high-speed line through south-east London is regarded
as politically sensitive because it would pass through densely populated
areas.
The line is unlikely to be completed until the end of the century. Passenger
trains travelling to the capital when the tunnel opens in 1993 will use
existing track to a terminal being constructed at Waterloo station south of
the Thames.
Two of the three other schemes considered by BR would terminate at Stratford
in east London. Another route proposed would pass through it before
proceeding by a tunnel to King's Cross.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From R A LEDINGHAM.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader states that US policy makers must accept that the principal
aim of G7 is not to secure the re-election of the president.
No more was it the aim of G7 to secure the re-election of the German
chancellor, but G7 members are adjusting to the economic consequences of his
election campaign. Neither is it now an aim of G7 to provide a framework for
a British prime minister to time monetary policy changes to attempt to win
an election in the midst of his own recession.
It is very easy to impute party political motives to the positions of G7
members but it is probably more worth- while to analyse the overt
propositions as objectively as possible.
The US is making the simple point that there is now a danger of worldwide
recession. Given that four members of G7 have admitted a classic domestic
recession, not including Germany which has a composite rate of unemployment
of 11 1/2 per cent, it does not seem to be an opinion which should be
derided and dismissed out of hand.
Acting on the assumption that the US is right risks a mild increase in
inflation. Acting on the assumption that the US is wrong risks a world
recession on the scale of the current UK recession or worse.
The latter is by far the most damaging prospect and if G7 have rejected the
need for a managed reduction in interest rates, we will have to hope that
they unanimously agreed to keep their fingers crossed.

<TEXT>
Your leader 'G7 under pressure' (April 30) was right in castigating the US
but wrong in minimising the problems of potential capital shortages. Demand
for capital has been outstripping supply at record levels in recent years,
so leading to historically high real long-term interest rates. These rates
will go still higher in the period ahead.
This will result from still greater increases in public sector borrowing by
leading industrial countries (the US federal government may alone borrow
upwards of a record Dollars 300bn this year) and from significant borrowing
by Middle East and east European countries (albeit not as massive as some
have suggested, but nevertheless significant).
The G7 issued a statement at the end of its meeting in typically arcane and
abstruse language. At least it acknowledged 'the persistence of high real
interest rates'. Let us hope that when it meets in London at the summit
level in July it can be clearer - real long-term rates will only start to
fall when most of the G7 governments cut their mounting budget deficits.
Meanwhile, given the bleak outlook for long-term rates, corporate borrowers
need to focus far more on equity financing; developing countries and those
in eastern Europe need to accelerate the pace of privatisation, while
institutions such as the EBRD and IFC need to do far more to assist these
countries to build securities markets.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr F X O'MALLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, P H Nunnerley, in his letter of April 23, states that 'we constantly
remind our customers to come to their bank manager at the first signs of
problems'. Sadly, despite all the glitz and rhetoric of the marketing men,
this is the same old tongue-in-cheek message preached by many bank managers
up and down the country.
Since problem detection in this manner can be a highly subjective exercise
(how many small business owners, totally immersed in the running of their
business, would elect to soldier on in the sometimes mistaken hope that the
matter would self-correct, rather than admit they had a problem?), would it
not be both more productive and desirable for the bank manager TO GO AND SEE
HIS CUSTOMER? By so doing, he would be demonstrating a real interest in his
customer's affairs as well as acquainting himself first-hand with some of
the problems and frustrations of trying to do business in the real world.
To maintain, as Mr Nunnerley does, that banks 'are largely in the hands of
the companies themselves', smacks of appalling smugness: try telling that
with a straight face to a small business owner, mortgaged to the hilt and
with a debenture around his neck.
In the final analysis, there can be no substitute for the good old-fashioned
virtue of customer service and in a world where long-established beliefs and
conventions are rapidly being swept aside, bank managers would do well to
spend more time in the field with their customers and, as a corollary, less
time in the relative comfort of the bank worrying about the size of their
provisions.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Still struggling to get out of a spin: British textile
companies must invest to be competitive in the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This spring the City of London has turned its attention to the dark satanic
mills of the textile industry as Tootal, one of Britain's oldest textile
groups, battles against a Pounds 252m hostile takeover bid from Coats
Viyella.
Tootal is fighting for independence at a time when the British textile
industry is under intense pressure. In the past two years hundreds of mills
have closed and scores of companies have folded. There were nearly 100 job
losses in textiles and clothing every working day last year.
The critical questions for Tootal, Coats and their competitors is when will
the industry - which employs 475,000 people and has a turnover of Pounds
14bn - recover and what will it look like at the end of the recession?
Recession is scarcely a new phenomenon for the textile industry, which has
been in decline since the early 1900s when it held a quarter of world trade.
Its development since the second world war has been dominated by its
struggle to find a role in a global market polarised between the Germans and
Italians with their high-technology mills at the upper end and the low-cost
Asian producers at the lower end.
The recession of the late 1970s and early 1980s finally convinced British
companies they could no longer compete successfully against the Asians. They
then invested in modern spinning and weaving systems to try to upgrade their
products and catch up with the Germans and Italians.
For a few years they seemed to have succeeded. Productivity rose by 40 per
cent between 1980 and 1988, when the industry invested Pounds 3bn in new
equipment. By the mid-1980s, when consumer spending was buoyant and sterling
was competitive against the US dollar (with which many Asian currencies are
linked) British textile companies basked in the benefits of rationalisation
and re-investment.
'A few years ago I really believed that all the work we had done had made
sure we could compete against anyone anywhere,' said Sir David Alliance,
chairman of Coats. 'But I was wrong.'
By the late 1980s when consumer spending started to slow and the pound
strengthened, the textile sector returned to recession. The crux of its
problems is that, despite all the investment of the mid-1980s, it is still
less competitive than the Germans and Italians. A report by the National
Institute of Economic and Social Research showed that British clothing
companies lagged behind the Germans in almost every area from training to
machinery maintenance.
The industry is now suffering on the domestic front not only from the
slowdown in consumer spending but also because of the financial instability
of its retail customers. At the same time the strong pound has made it more
difficult for British products to compete against imports.
The industry is also prey to the vagaries of the global textile trade. It is
vulnerable to unpredictable swings in fashion and to unexpected changes in
raw material prices. There are also sudden surges of imports, like a recent
influx of cheap Chinese cotton knickers. And there is growing competition
from subsidised industries, such as the Indian and Turkish spinning sectors.
The whole industry has suffered in the recession, but the worst-affected
areas are those that faced additional pressures. The knitting industry has
been hit by the trend away from traditional knitwear and by a rapid rise in
imports of socks from Indonesia and knitted babywear from Thailand. Its
workforce has fallen by 17,000 to 65,000 and 150 knitting companies have
closed in the past 18 months.
In the short term the rationalisation is likely to continue. Coats's main
aim in bidding for Tootal is to merge their international thread businesses.
But Coats also hopes to combine their interests in the UK where Tootal
employs 6,500 people and is a leading supplier of shirts and trousers to
Marks and Spencer.
This integration would probably involve combining administrative operations
and some cuts in production capacity. Coats has said that, if the bid
succeeds, there could be up to 500 job losses. Even if the bid fails, Tootal
will continue with its own cost-cutting.
As the takeover struggle continues there is no evidence of improvement in
the general trading environment. The domestic market does seem to have
stabilised in terms of demand, albeit at a low level. However, last month's
rise in the rate of value added tax to 17.5 per cent is a serious concern.
Higher clothing prices could not only depress demand, but will also
intensify pressure on profitability. Retailers are trying to pass on the VAT
increase to their clothing suppliers which in turn are seeking to hand it on
to their yarn and cloth suppliers.
Most companies are resigned to the recession continuing at least until the
autumn. They should then see the first signs of revival if, as most
forecasters expect, consumer spending recovers and the stronger dollar
alleviates the pressure from Asian imports.
'Next year we should see a virtuous cycle of stronger demand and more
favourable currency,' said Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds
Textiles, which has extensive spinning and clothing interests. 'That will be
nice but it will not secure the industry's future. For that we need to build
a robust business.'
The dominant issue for the industry is whether the recession has impeded its
attempts to become more competitive in the international market.
Even when the recession does end, one of its results will be that many
companies will have cut capital expenditure at a time when the Germans and
Italians - who already had more modern plants - have carried on investing.
British investment peaked at Pounds 549m in 1988 and fell to about Pounds
450m last year.
However the recession has been beneficial in some respects, notably by
weeding out the least competitive areas of the industry. Small family
businesses have borne the brunt. Most of the 150 knitting companies which
closed were small 'sweatshop' concerns.
Similarly many of the plants making cheaper products have disappeared,
particularly in spinning and weaving. This means the surviving mills
concentrate on the more expensive products that are less vulnerable to
fluctuations in exchange rates.
A further consequence of the recession has been to accelerate changes within
individual companies. One of the most important trends is
internationalisation. Traditionally most textile groups have concentrated
production in Britain. They are now manufacturing an increasing proportion
of their merchandise overseas - mainly in lower-cost Asian countries -
either in their own plants or from sub-contractors.
This means a women's wear manufacturer, such as Dewhirst, cuts costs by
sourcing the first batch of an order from Asia. It then makes later batches
in its British factories which offer a speedier service by reducing delivery
times.
The trend towards overseas sourcing seems set to continue. William Baird,
one of the largest clothing companies, staged a Pounds 39m rights issue this
week to raise money for expansion. One of the main areas for investment will
be Asia.
'We are still committed to investment in the UK,' said Mr Donald Parr,
chairman. 'But our overseas interests will be the focus of expansion for the
next five or six years.'
Overseas sourcing is scarcely a panacea for the British textile industry.
But it can not be a coincidence that the most resilient companies during the
recession have been those with extensive overseas interests and strong
investment records.
Courtaulds Textiles, which began the 1980s as a traditional British-based
group, ended the decade as a portfolio of specialised international
businesses. It has suffered in the recession. It cut its workforce by 3,200
to 28,200 last year. But it still managed to maintain profits at Pounds 40m
on sales of Pounds 984m in 1990 thanks to disciplined management and a broad
international base.
This is the type of company that is best placed to benefit when the industry
pulls out of recession. It would be foolish to pretend that the 1990s offer
anything to the British textile industry other than a continuation of the
same struggle for international competitiveness.
But Courtaulds Textiles' record suggests that if the surviving British
companies are prepared to invest in technology, management and international
expansion they should be able to secure a future in the volatile world of
textiles.

What must the rest of UK industry make of yesterday's ceremonial marking the
opening of Smith New Court's latest London headquarters? Prime Minister
Major was on parade with an army of City dignitaries led by the governor of
the Bank of England, adding to the perception that SNC is one of Britain's
great success stories.
Perhaps it is, in City terms. But for a company with a market capitalisation
of under Pounds 40m, and an annual staff bill more than twice the combined
pre-tax profits and losses of the last five years, such pageantry seems
over-blown.
Doubtless the razzmatazz has something to do with having ex-politicos such
as Peter Walker on the board. But one wonders why the star cast is so
reluctant to turn up at opening ceremonies for much bigger and more
successful companies outside London.

Norman Lamont's spring trip to Washington, away from the worries of
Westminster and Notting Hill, obviously did him the world of good.
By the end of the proceedings when most finance ministers have that numbed
look that goes with listening to endless set speeches, the chancellor was
beaming and bouncy. Luckily, he did not have to suffer the ignominy of the
usual sterling crisis that always seems to coincide with IMF meetings. But
another reason was the chancellor's elevation to near hero status among the
Germans.
'The toast of Bonn' was how one over-enthusiastic German observer described
Lamont. The chancellor won this unlikely accolade after standing firm with
Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, in resisting US pressure for lower
interest rates.
He also earned some useful brownie points by making hawkish noises against
inflation and stressing the need for a strong D-Mark in tones that could
have come from Bundesbank president Karl Otto Pohl.

It is rare for a general chamber of commerce to become a political hotbed.
But that's what has happened in Hong Kong where big-business interests keen
to quieten anti-China dissent have squashed the colony's self-styled
spokesman for small business, 67-year-old expatriate Jimmy McGregor.
A former director of the chamber and its representative on Hong Kong's
legislative council since 1988, he has just declared he will not stand in
the next council elections. The reason, he claims, is that the big
businesses dominating the chamber's general committee have 'stacked the
cards' against him, favouring his opponent Paul Cheng. Cheng, an executive
director of Inchcape Pacific, already sits on the legislative body as a
government nominee.
'It stinks,' says the abrasive McGregor, who defeated an establishment
candidate for council membership in 1988, and has called for faster
democratic development as well as greater resistance to China than the
chamber's big names could stomach.
One who has been particularly angered by his stance is Helmut Sohmen, who
runs the shipping empire of father-in-law Sir Yue-Kong Pao. Another is the
chamber's new chairman Vincent Lo, a construction and property entrepreneur
with close China connections.
McGregor's predicament is partly self-inflicted because he has gone his own
way without trying to build bridges with his critics. But Cheng, who
exemplifies Inchcape blandness and government orthodoxy, is a pale
replacement. Such machinations, although perhaps making China and big
business happy, do little for democracy - especially in a place like Hong
Kong where it has hardly begun developing.

'We have always announced our results on this day,' sniffs George Younger,
Royal's new chairman. Bank of Scotland, the more senior of the two, admits
it was the guilty party because it changed its own date. But by the time it

Leningrad, cradle of the Bolshevik revolution, is to hold a referendum
whether to go back to its pre-revolutionary name of St Petersburg. The June
12 poll will coincide with elections to the new post of Russian president.
Anatoly Sobchak, the Soviet second city's radical mayor, previously wanted
the name-change issue postponed. He had argued that Leningrad could not
afford to waste its scarce resources on such a matter in the middle of the
country's worst economic crisis since the Second World War.
However, emigre author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who is also an ardent
patriot, has objections of a different nature. In an open letter from his
home in Vermont, he tells Leningraders they should abandon the idea of a
name sounding like 'Sankt Peterburg' because it has too Germanic a ring.
Instead, he suggests a completely new name: Svyato-Petrograd. This
amalgamates the Russian words for saint, city, and Peter, in that order. The
city, founded by Peter the Great, was re-titled Petrograd, after the first
1917 revolution in February, then later called 'Leningrad' in honour of the
Bolshevik leader.
His real name, of course, was Ulyanov.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Economic Viewpoint: Reappearance of the 'growthmen'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The years after the first oil shock following the Yom Kippur war of 1973
were ones of very rapid inflation and slow average growth. But national
leaders thought they had learned something from this experience and the
1980s saw a somewhat better growth performance and a much lower average
inflation rate.
Policy was governed by what some people have called the 'new orthodoxy', and
what I once called the counter-revolution. Its intellectual underpinning
was, among other things, a demonstration by Professor Milton Friedman in
1967 that governments could not spend their way into desired rates of output
and employment without risking not merely an inflation, but accelerating
inflation.
This theme was put starkly by the then Mr James Callaghan to, of all bodies,
the 1976 Labour party conference when the UK was negotiating a rescue
package with the IMF. The Labour prime minister's words were repeated time
without number by Mrs Thatcher and her chancellors. One reason why Labour
still wants to dabble in industrial interventionism is that it is not
prepared to challenge this new macroeconomic orthodoxy, any more than
President Mitterrand's socialist government is in France.
The new orthodoxy does not mean that all policy is 'ineffective' - a
caricature view of what some later academics have espoused. It merely states
that macroeconomic policy will be most effective if it concentrates on
nominal aims - such as stable prices, exchange rate objectives, monetary
targets or Nominal GDP - the precise choice or combination of objectives
varying with time and place.
Who are the main opponents of the new orthodoxy? They are in ascending order
of importance: the technical monetarists who are so incensed by exchange
rate targets or any departure from their personally favoured monetary
aggregates that they threaten us with the spectre of world depression. In
practice their advice is not too different from that of the pockets of
unreconstructed Keynesianism that remain in academia, and more instinctively
among politicians and businessmen. A good example is the British House of
Commons Treasury Committee, which still sees salvation in reforming the
official forecasts and has now come up with the perverse idea of four
forecasts a year instead of two, with politicians not interfering - as if
that alone were a guarantee of impartiality. The chancellor is right that a
careful use of surveys can provide a better idea of turning-points than any
number of formal forecasts.
But the only unreconstructed group of growthmen who really matter are in the
US policy-making establishment - interestingly, the Republicans, even more
than the Democrats. The most unreconstructed of all appears to be President
George Bush, despite his avowed preference for foreign affairs (for which
many Kurds will be grateful).
Has the world been experiencing such a depression or growth recession that
it is reasonable to throw away the new orthodoxy and stimulate spending at
all costs? The large chart, taken from a DRI McGraw Hill study of The
International Outlook after the Gulf War*, shows that the slow-down in world
real growth has so far been mild by historical standards. On the other hand,
inflation, on present prospects, is unlikely to fall as far as it did in the
mid-1980s, when admittedly it was given a downward shove by a collapse in
the oil price.
The annualised rate of growth of US Nominal GDP has now slowed down from 8
per cent in 1988 to 3 1/2 per cent in the first quarter of 1991 compared
with a year ago (and 2 1/2 per cent compared with the previous quarter).
This is far from being a depression rate; but it is low enough to create
some presumption in favour of stimulation. The obstinate persistence of
underlying US inflation (measured by the GDP deflator) at 4 per cent
suggests caution about the dose and keeping an eye on the dollar.
Even if US nominal demand needs a stimulus, it is still difficult to see why
other countries have also to be pressurised into reducing interest rates.
This might have made sense in the US a few months ago when the weakness of
the dollar was cited by some Fed governors as a reason for resisting still
cheaper money. But after the dollar shot up why did the US administration
bother to launch its deservedly abortive Group of Seven initiative, rebuffed
by the Germans and Japanese? Unilateral US interest rate cuts are surely
more useful in achieving the administration's twin objectives of a brake on
the dollar and stimulating domestic growth.
US action only makes sense on the assumption that the administration was in
such a panic about economic prospects that it wanted to throw in every
weapon of which it could think: lower interest rates abroad; much lower
interest rates at home; a dollar depreciation to boot; and every kind of
pressure on its trading partners.
Normally, I abstain from second guessing the US economy from 3,000 miles
away. But an interesting light is thrown by some confidence surveys put
together by the London Business School. These show that US consumer
confidence, which had plunged alarmingly during the Gulf conflict, has now
returned to a near-level trend, despite a very slight kick-back in April.
Producer confidence, which normally lags, is still declining.
In the UK the profile has been different. Consumer confidence started to
deteriorate much earlier. The beginnings of a recovery were apparent in the
middle of 1990 but were nipped in the bud by the Gulf crisis; but since the
'end' of the war the improvement has resumed. Producer confidence is charted
by the CBI survey. The accompanying table shows key answers compared with
the corresponding period of the 1980 recession. Answers relating to past or
recent performance show a sharper deterioration than was expected at the
turn of the year. But forward-looking answers show what can only be
described as much less pessimism.
The two questions with the best record in plotting turning points are
business optimism and expected volume of output. Although there is still a
balance of pessimists over optimists, it is much smaller than in January and
much smaller than in the corresponding period of 1980. The same applies to
expected volume of output (and a similar picture is shown by the chart of
expected orders). Export pessimism is also much less than in January and in
the corresponding period of 1980. For there has not been the kind of upward
pressure on sterling that squeezed business so much a decade ago. But there
is still enough pressure on margins to put a dampener on producer prices.
The balance of companies expecting to raise their prices is now at its
lowest since 1967.
The most dismal answer relates to employment, where there is still a
substantial balance of respondents expected to lay off workers. The British
disease of putting all the pressure on staff numbers rather than pay costs
remains; and because unemployment is a lagging indicator it will continue at
varying rates well into 1992.
A broader perspective is supplied by the IMF chart showing the deviation of
output from trend in different groups of countries. In the three
English-speaking countries, the US, the UK and Canada, output rose in the
late 1980s to a non-sustainable level in relation to capacity; and in order
to keep inflation down, these economies will have to go through a period of
below-capacity operation, even when recovery of sorts begins. In France and
Italy, there was a smaller boom and a more moderate slump is in prospect. In
Japan and West Germany, the picture has been much more stable. The deep
growth recession of 1987 was probably an aberration.
The different experience of the English-speaking countries (which could have
included Australia) has to do with the high indebtedness incurred by
borrowers in those countries after financial liberalisation and the severe
retrenchment now taking place. It may be that both borrowers and lenders in
these countries will henceforth follow a course of 'once bitten, twice shy'.
In any case the fashionable calls for 'reregulation' would weaken these
countries in the sector where they have the clearest comparative advantage.

IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES (18) Metro, Screen on the Hill

The Ballad Of The Sad Cafe, directed by British actor-director Simon Callow
from Carson McCullers' indelibly wry Southern novella, is a mongrel with
mythic pretensions. It lopes towards us with gloom-laden eyes and righteous
humourlessness, turning the original story's witty particularity of cadence
into a portentous, generalised growl. In its mouth it carries something
long, gawky and voluble. Surely it cannot be Vanessa Redgrave? It is:
complete with Southern accent as 'Miss Amelia', McCullers' tough,
broomstick-tall bar-owner who falls in love with a dwarf and is undone by a
handsome rogue.
The dwarf (Cork Hubbert) is her cousin Lyman, the rogue (Keith Carradine) is
her estranged husband Marvin, and the setting - for what in the original is
one of the greatest slices of Southern Gothic ever written - is a town so
small it has almost curled up and erased itself from the map. Here our
heroine opens her weird cafe, closes her heart to all but Lyman and finally
unfurls her spirit and her fists to fight the ex-convict spouse who returns
to haunt her.
Producer Ismail Merchant (A Room With A View, Mr And Mrs Bridge) is the
matchmaker who brought Callow to McCullers and must be responsible for the
daunting shambles that results. Stuffed with fine actors, the movie never
transcends its look of a filmed play, and one shot in sackcloth brown and
penitential blues. (The credits acknowledge Edward Albee's ill-conceived
stage adaptation as well as the McCullers novella.) The exterior scenes are
lifelessly framed and lit. And the town never convinces as a living
community: just a scattering of clapboard barns and a group of
Depression-garbed extras who behave with all the animation of an opera
chorus trying to stand still during an aria.
If Redgrave had triumphed, the spotlight-on-the-star style might have been
vindicated. She gives it everything she has, but this is one of those roles
in which withholding is as important as giving. Her Kentucky-Fried accent,
her frantic incandescence of feature ('Once more, Vanessa,' one imagines a
director pleading, 'with less feeling') and her gawky, pugnacious figure: it
comes over too often like Olive Oyl auditioning for the role of Blanche
DuBois.
Add an underpowered Carradine and an overpowered Rod Steiger (as Rev Willin)
and the word 'unevenness' seems an understatement. McCullers wrote a story
as subtle and paradoxical as an airplant: the extraordinary grew out of the
ordinary, the sublime out the banal or brink-of-ridiculous. Callow, in
taking a self-proclaimed high road towards the 'mythic', misses absolutely
everything that made the original scenic, surprising and affecting.
In America, where the cocktail was invented, we can be so startled by the
incongruous ingredients poured into one vessel that we forget to say 'When',
or even 'Why?'. Take an ageing American playwright, Arthur Miller; mix him
with two youngish American stars, Debra Winger and Nick Nolte; and then stir
in a middle-aged British director, Karel Reisz. Everybody Wins is well into
its second act - we use the theatrical term advisedly - before the viewer
asks, 'What on earth are all these talents doing together and do they know
that the film is coming apart around them?'
A miscarried murder trial lures lawyer Nick Nolte to a small New England
town, hired by Debra Winger, a bad-time girl trying to go good. 'Would you
like some vitamins or something?' she asks Nolte on inviting him over her
threshold. He looks as if he would like something stronger and he soon gets
it. Miss Winger proves a flirt, a tease, an emotional chameleon; and the
murder case gradually exposes a major case of civic and political
corruption. Before lights-up we find ourselves negotiating a crazed biker
(Will Patton) who builds religious shrines, a drug-smuggling ring of town
professionals and a Judge (Jack Warden) with his mind on lower things than
justice.
In early scenes Reisz directs this bizarre fable of American breakdown -
something like The Crucible meets The Stepford Wives - with the basilisk
acerbity he brought to The French Lieutenant's Woman.
With Winger and Nolte acting out their psychosexual scorpion-dance there
promises to be blood before bedtime, and Miller's dialogue swings between
the ironically fulsome (She to him: 'If there's such a thing as hope in this
world, you're it') and the whipcrack witty (He to her: 'You've been trying
to go North, South and powder your nose at the same time.')
But once the plot widens, so do the fissures in its credibility. We wonder
how one small American town can contain so many offbeat exemplars of
favourite Miller themes: religion, justice, sexual volatility. We hear the
creak of Ibsenism in the corruption-prone pillars of this community.
And even in the film's strongest ingredient - the push-me-pull-you liaison
between Nolte and Winger - we discern echoes of the Miller-Monroe emotional
prizefight and its definitive transcription in After The Fall.
The Hard Way mirror-writes the movement of mood and style in Everybody Wins.
It begins frantic and fractured, it becomes caustic and harmonious. As soon
as Michael J Fox sloughs his blond wig and overplayed Malibu brattishness
for New York street-guise - he plays a Hollywood film star who goes native
with the NY police to research a gritty cop role - this action comedy
directed by John Badham (WarGames, Stakeout) develops a sweet cantankerous
buzz.
Policeman James Woods is Fox's mentor and role model, a human wasp's-nest
who flies out and stings himself at the smallest provocation. Since Fox's
provocations are far from small, and include a tendency to mimic for memory
every tic or aphorism his partner produces, Woods is soon reprising the
jitterbug excitability he brought to Salvador and The Boost. (Exasperation
has long been one of the cinema's great comic resources, vide Oliver Hardy
or WC Fields.)
The chemistry between Woods and Fox gives the film the stamina to survive
some daft plotting and predictable stunt climaxes; plus a script (Daniel
Pyne and Lem Dobbs) that is no better than it should be and may have been
encouraged by the gimmick-hungry makers to be rather worse.
Channel 4 television has just spent three weeks agonising about screen
censorship in this isle. But who says we are in the depths of a repression?
Nagisa Oshima's In The Realm Of The Senses, an erotic inferno made in 1976
by the Japanese director of The Ceremony and Death By Hanging, opens in
London for the first time fully certificated. No sexual holds are barred,
and several new-to-me holds exhibited, in this tale of a love affair with a
gory consummation. (It is based on a true-life liebestod between two
geisha-house lovers in 1936.) The lady ends up triumphantly clutching the
gentleman's severed parts - he having died, pre-mutilation, in a way we
would all wish to - and Oshima mills sardonic tragicomedy and surprising
visual grace from a romance in which Wagner meets Sacher-Masoch.
In The Company Of Strangers, a first film by Canadian director Cynthia
Scott, a group of old ladies on a country outing struggle for meaning and
survival when their coach breaks down far from civilisation. The concept is
sweet - real-life wrinklies playing the lady castaways who abandon bus and
find companionship in rural hardship - but the structure is too loose and
the ethno-human recipe too schematic. A black woman, an American Indian, an
Irish nun, an English cockney, a Canadian lesbian . . . We have heard of
cross-sections, but this is ridiculous.
Less ridiculous, though, than Predator 2. New York has a problem. A fuzzy
special-effects monster, its ego inflated by the success of Predator 1,
stalks the city trying to eat people. Cop Danny Glover tries to stop it. But
he has no adequate support from director Stephen Hopkins, who provides
mindless violence and off-the-peg Alien atmospherics.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Arts: Crisis brews for London arts funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of a hundred arts companies in London, including such established
names as the Almeida Theatre, the King's Head, the Photographer's Gallery
and Dance Umbrella, hangs in the balance following the decision of Ealing
Council on Tuesday to reject the proposed Pounds 29m budget for the London
Borough Grants Scheme, suggesting instead an expenditure of Pounds 26m.
A Crisis in London Arts Funding Steering Group had already been set up to
fight the lower than expected Pounds 29m budget, which reduced the arts
grants allocated by the LBGC (which also funds welfare projects) from Pounds
3m to Pounds 2m, involving the immediate loss of money to 16 companies
including the Almeida, (Pounds 55,000); the ICA (Pounds 55,000); The
Photographer's Gallery (Pounds 47,000); and Greenwich Theatre (Pounds
45,000).
Now the vote at Ealing throws the future of the reduced sum into jeopardy.
The LBGS meets again on May 8 for another attempt to fix a budget, which
requires a two thirds majority. Even if it re-establishes the Pounds 29m
budget, which is by no means certain, the cheques for the surviving arts
beneficiaries will not come through until June, three months into the
current financial year.
The confirmed loss of grants, and the uncertainty over the future, has
already resulted in staff cuts at 40 per cent of the companies who have had
LBGS funding axed.
Timothy Mason, for ten years Director of the Scottish Arts Council, is to
take over as Chief Executive of the new London Arts Board, which succeeds
the defunct Greater London Arts in October.
GLA lost the confidence of the Arts Council and the larger London arts
organisations who were to be allocated to it under the Government arts
devolution policy. By choosing such an experienced administrator the Council
will hope to restore faith in the concept of London having its own arts
board.

Newly refurbished for this revival (sponsored by British Fuels Group),
Janacek's little opera comes up fresh as paint, and irresistible. Nothing
has faded in David Pountney's production, nor in Maria Bjornson's witty,
pretty designs - all the visual jokes re-play very well; and Nick Chelton's
lighting has been beautifully recreated. I admit to preferring this Vixen to
the Royal Opera's more hi-tech version, handsome though that is.
It is not easy to imagine the new principals bettered. Lesley Garrett sings
as if the role of the Vixen were what she'd always aimed at: bright, utterly
confident and vital, appealing without a trace of cute whimsy. No vocal
squeaks, either, in a part full of perilous leaps; she delivers it with
flawless musical sympathy, and in the erotic passages - particularly candid
with these furry lovers - she twangs one's heartstrings.
Her Fox, Christine Botes, pleaded a sore throat on this first night, but
that can only mean that she will be even better later. She managed an
attractive sound anyway, shaped her phrases with the same authority as Miss
Garrett, and deployed her Jack-the-lad persona with a disarming, toothy
grin.
No doubt both these remarkable debuts in the roles owe much to Sir Charles
Mackerras, who knows the score as well as anyone in the world. Though he has
been conducting it for years, this was his first time with it at the English
National Opera. It sounded glorious: he had the violins dancing and
sparkling even in that cruelly high register where Janacek likes to push
them, and some kind of magic (partly electronic?) was worked with the great
burst of hunting-horns. Mackerras began the third act with the proper stark
menace; but everywhere else the music was steeped in affectionate warmth,
quite memorably in the courting-and-mating of Act Two.
If Norman Bailey is now slightly under-powered for the grand final
peroration, his sage, grizzled Forester is a masterly operatic portrait.
Indeed, though the character is no saint, Bailey gives him a kind of moral
weight which serves as anchor for everything else that goes on. He is
abetted with delightful skill by Terry Jenkins' woeful Schoolmaster and Mark
Richardson's gloomy Parson. The numerous other roles are vividly taken, and
a lot of excellent children do their foxcubs and other woodland creatures
with neat charm, coyness-free - more praise to Pountney and his
choreographer Stuart Hopps.
For newcomers to the opera, there could be no happier introduction. A
creditable amount of the English text is made distinct; adults can enjoy the
piece as much with children, for whom it will all seem perfectly clear, as
without. And long-standing fans of the Vixen will certainly discover many
moments in the opera which have not seemed so apt and telling before; and
above all, as I said, the central soprano pair are pure delight.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): French invasion
repulsed - Speculation about agency takeovers is over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

<TEXT>
The world of French advertising is nothing if not melodramatic. There are
the writs that fly from agency to agency. There is a rumpus over the
publication of Le Grand Bluff, a book accusing France's leading ad agencies
of everything from bribing politicians to fiddling their finances.
This spring the drama has centred on Carat, France's biggest media buying
business, and on the advertisements it has been running in Le Figaro and Les
Echos attacking the rest of the Paris advertising establishment.
Carat's competitors try to dismiss the campaign as a defensive gesture from
a company under pressure. Yet it comes at a sensitive time when the French
advertising industry is trying to come to terms not only with a slowdown in
growth but also with the financial problems of some of France's most
powerful agencies.
'We are facing a slowdown in the rate of growth, rather than an actual fall
in expenditure,' says Maurice Levy, chairman of Publicis, the biggest single
French agency. 'But the market is undoubtedly getting tougher.'
The instability of the Dollars 7.87bn (Pounds 4.6bn) French advertising
market clearly poses problems for the large Paris agencies, but it also has
implications for the rest of the international advertising industry.
First, France, as the world's fifth largest advertising market, is a
significant source of revenue for the multinational advertising networks
based in New York and London. Second, the slowdown in their domestic market
may inhibit the international ambitions of the Paris agencies which have
recently emerged as aggressive players in the global advertising arena.
The main reason for the slowdown in French advertising is, unsurprisingly,
the corresponding slowdown in France's economy - now thought to be on the
brink of recession - and the uncertainty on the political scene.
The French agencies' problems have been aggravated by the instability of the
international advertising industry. Earlier this year the Gulf war cast a
cloud over advertising worldwide. France was not affected to the same extent
as some markets, notably the US, but the conflict did put pressure on
certain sectors such as travel and tourism.
Moreover, the US recession has prompted some US-based multinationals -
responsible for roughly 30 per cent of all French ad expenditure - to cut
their budgets in France, and in other European markets, in an attempt to
counter their financial problems in the US.
'It is too soon to say what the outcome for 1991 will be,' says Pierre de
Plas, chairman of TBWA. 'At first everyone expected growth of 6 per cent,
but the eventual level of growth will certainly be lower than that.'
The market has also been destabilised by the developments within the ad
industry itself. First, the wave of media deregulation in France, such as
the television privatisation programme, which was an important catalyst for
the industry's growth in the 1980s, has ground to a halt.
Second, the media buying market is becoming increasingly competitive. One of
the main developments in French advertising during the 1980s was the growth
of Carat, which expanded rapidly to become the biggest single force in media
buying with roughly 20 per cent of the market.
Carat's growth has imposed intense pressure on the French agencies. In the
past year the agencies have battled back by banding together into buying
groups - such as The Media Partnership which includes J Walter Thompson,
Ogilvy &amp; Mather, BBDO and DDB:Needham - to become more competitive with
Carat.
The consensus in the industry is that the formation of these groups is
already squeezing media buying margins. Even Charles Hochman, chairman of
Carat, accepts there is 'a definite trend' for margins to shrink.
Third, some leading French agencies are in an unstable state after two years
of active international expansion. Eurocom, the largest French marketing
group, has suffered a series of senior management departures. It is also
still in the throes of reorganising its interests after taking control of
the old WCRS advertising agencies and more recently buying out the European
arm of the HDM network.
At the same time Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit and Roux Seguela Cayzac Goudard have
been left with heavy debts after their international activities. BDDP
completed a series of deals culminating in last year's investment in Wells
Riche Greene of the US. RSCG acquired two UK companies: Conran in design and
KLP in sales promotion.
Despite a growing reluctance by banks to lend to agencies at a time of
recession, Publicis is still pressing ahead with its expansion. Earlier this
week it announced the acquisition of Overad, one of the larger Dutch
agencies. Next month it is expected to finalise plans for a second
pan-European advertising network. However, Maurice Levy is swift to quash
rumours that Publicis is planning a full-scale bid for Foote Cone &amp; Belding,
its US partner.
The other French agencies are expected to adopt a more moderate approach,
although Eurocom is mooted as a potential purchaser for Scali McCabe Sloves
in the US. The days when other international agencies speculated feverishly
about the threat of a 'French invasion' are over.
Even Jean-Claud Boulet, chairman of BDDP, generally seen as the most
ambitious of all the Paris agencies, now talks in cautious terms. 'The next
few years will be a time of consolidation,' he said. 'It is time to build on
the businesses we already own.'

FT  02 MAY 91 / Management: (Electricity flotation): A voice-over with a
Scottish accent - Scottish Privatisation / The campaign to sell power shares
is aimed at the mass market in its home base and the more sophisticated
investor in the rest of the UK
</HEADLINE>

For television viewers in Scotland, it is 1314 and Robert the Bruce has just
gloriously routed the English at the battle of Bannockburn.
An eager fourteenth century reporter, parchment at the ready, accosts the
triumphant and dishevelled Scottish king as he leaves the field. 'You must
be well-pleased, Robert. A great result on the night.'
'Oh yes, Jimmy. The boys done well. It was a game of two halves and we've
proved once again we're a very hard team to beat at home,' pronounces Bruce.
The two carry on reviewing the battle in the idiom of the football field
until the reporter mentions the Scottish electricity companies' share offer.
'Well, Jimmy,' Bruce replies, 'the boys still have time to apply
themselves.'
Meanwhile, viewers in England find themselves at the court of Queen
Elizabeth I. A foppish Sir Walter Raleigh is summoned to the royal presence
and instructed to go and find a prospectus for the share offer.
He tries to get out of it but excuses are stifled with a sharp retort: 'On
your bike, Raleigh]'. At this point, much to the delight of the court, the
handlebars of the said velocipede are shoved straight at his most sensitive
parts; exit Sir Walter.
These two jokey interpretations of history form part of a series devised by
Faulds, an Edinburgh-based advertising agency, for the marketing of shares
in Scottish Power, which covers the southern part of Scotland, and
Hydro-Electric in the north. The two companies are due to be floated later
this month.
This jolly romp through history features Forbes Masson and Alan Cumming
alias Victor and Barry, a Scottish comedy duo, in roles as various as Robert
the Bruce, Macbeth and a witch, the Emperor Hadrian and - in a particularly
camp scene - Bonnie Prince Charlie and Flora Macdonald.
The series is the successor to the 'Frank N Stein' theme devised by WCRS for
last November's sale of the English and Welsh regional electricity companies
and the Collett, Dickinson Pearce 'Have you got the power?' theme for
February's sale of the generators.
But Faulds faced a different, perhaps trickier, task in devising the
campaign for the Scottish companies than had the other two agencies because
the marketing drive in Scotland is quite different from that in the rest of
the UK.
In Scotland, the shares are being marketed on a mass scale, as were those of
the regional companies. But elsewhere, as in the generators' flotation, the
campaign is being targeted at the more sophisticated private investor.
The reasons are clear: in Scotland, take-up of privatisations has been low.
Sale of these companies, of which the local population are customers, is
seen by the government as a good opportunity to convert Scotland to share
ownership. In England, by contrast, the government started off with an
extensive list of privatisation share buyers, but without the customer
connection.
Scottish investors are being offered the choice of applying only for shares
in their local company, or for a package comprising shares in both.
Elsewhere, people can buy only the package. The minimum first payment for
customers is set at Pounds 100; others will have to put up three times that.
So television advertisements and posters are appearing in only the more
affluent south-east of England. There are press advertisements in the Daily
Express and the Daily Mail but not in other tabloids.
In Scotland, by contrast, posters, television advertisements and press ads
are appearing across the country.
Despite these differences, Faulds decided against running separate campaigns
in the two regions. James Faulds, managing director, explains: 'That could
have been confusing, since you can buy national newspapers in both Scotland
and England, and it would also have been more expensive.'
Stressing the Scottishness of the companies, he says, was found to be a
useful device in England. As far as business goes, people associate being
Scottish with positive characteristics, such as canniness and prudence. But
one might think sending up revered Scottish figures would be a risky
strategy north of the border.
However, Faulds says research before the campaign started did not bear that
out. 'Scots enjoy having a laugh at themselves though they can get annoyed
if outsiders do it,' he says. But with Cumming and Masson playing the
leading roles and Stanley Baxter and Ian Cuthbertson doing the voice-overs,
it has very much a home-grown feel.
As in other privatisations, the series provides a simple guide to the steps
prospective applicants have to take. First they are reminded to register to
ensure that they are eligible for shareholder incentives. Later, during the
offer period, they are told how to get an application form and the deadline
for submitting it.
For the most part, these simple messages are conveyed in the same way in
both regions, although in England the phrase 'Scots or not' is tacked onto
the end of the voice-overs.
However, in some cases the messages had to diverge, for instance, during the
offer period. There were worries that people in England would not realise
prospectuses were widely available outside Scotland, and this message could
not be got across in the Bannockburn advertisement. Hence Queen Elizabeth's
reminder to Raleigh that prospectuses can be found at banks 'throughout my
realm'.
Different shareholder incentives and minimum application levels also
presented a stumbling block; so one advertisement is being screened only in
Scotland at the moment. It is a conversation between Robert the Bruce and
the spider which, according to legend, he Bannockburn.
Bruce raises various objections to registering for the share offer,
including the fact that he is 'a wee bit short' at the moment. The spider
finally persuades him to do so by saying he need pay only Pounds 100
upfront.
Faulds hopes that the historical characters theme gives 'durability' to the
series because it allows new people and situations to be introduced as the
campaign progresses. Once people realise what the theme is, they start
wondering who will appear next.
But however evocative and entertaining the advertisements may be, no one
thinks they will actually persuade people to apply for the shares. The one
crucial factor in persuading them to do that is whether the offer is
endorsed by financial journalists and there is nothing Faulds' creative team
can do about that.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Accountancy Column: Secrecy and success in schizophrenic
institute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMAGINE THAT you are a bright young partner in one of the UK's top 20
accountancy practices. Like all young partners, you are eager to promote
your career. But, unlike the majority of this breed, you take a lively
interest in professional affairs.
You have impassioned views on the Caparo decision, you are fascinated by the
politics of accounting standards, you are proud of your profession. But
would you like to reach the pinnacle of the profession and become president
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales?
Even if you would like to achieve this honour, would you know how to go
about it? The answer is probably no, for even ageing senior partners who
have decades of experience of the institute and its arcane ways have little
idea of how the president is elected.
The Accountancy Column can reveal exclusively that the president is elected
by the meeting of the institute's council members every June.
There are more than 80 of these distinguished personages, who collectively
take responsibility for running the institute. At the end of the June
meeting, one of them will be chosen for the presidency three years in the
future, because elections are held three years in advance.
This is not as simple as it seems. Even though council members vote for the
next president but two, they have no choice in the matter. There has never,
in the 111-year history of the institute, been more than one candidate for
this eminent position. In short, the election is predetermined.
The real election takes place several months before at a meeting - or a
series of meetings - of the so-called president's advisory committee. This
is the most secret of all the ICAEW's myriad committees  - so secret that it
goes under different names according to the different functions it fulfils.
On occasions this committee is known as the committee review subcommittee.
Under this name it decides who shall chair and take the main positions on
the institute's policy-making committees - the parliamentary and law
committee and the business law committee, as well as the district societies
standing conference and the financial and auditing committee.
As the president's advisory committee, it is responsible for producing a
candidate for the presidency.
Under normal circumstances, the membership consists of this year's
president, the deputy and the vice-president (presidents for next year and
the year after), and the institute's last six presidents. When in its
committee review sub-committee capacity, three, not six, past-presidents
attend, plus one other council member.
The veil cannot be lifted any further. It is not known what are the concerns
of the past presidents and the present president, and the next two
presidents to come, when they produce a name for the presidential candidate.
To its credit, the ICAEW has itself recognised the limitations of the
methods by which presidents are elected. Under Mr Arthur Green, a former
president and therefore a member of the most secret committee, a working
party has undertaken an extensive review of the ICAEW's constitutional
arrangements.
The report, published last month, recommends that the council be replaced
with an enlarged representative assembly and a slimmed-down executive board.
The board, which would take over many of the functions of the current
council, would also be responsible for electing the president.
The president's advisory committee would be replaced with a nominating
committee, the job of which would be to nominate candidates. Any person
getting the support of more than 10 per cent of the 150-person
representative committee would have to be among the nominees going forward
to the board for election.
This constitutional review is the latest example of head-scratching going on
at Moorgate Place. Highly successful though the 111-year old institute may
be, it is in some ways an institution looking for a role.
The ICAEW's success is demonstrable. It has 87,000 active members - half of
whom work in industry and the other half in professional practice - giving
it unrivalled sway over British commercial life.
Every year a queue of thousands of the UK's cleverest graduates embarks on
the arduous training which ultimately leads to membership of the institute.
But the ICAEW is today suffering the consequences of its success. Its
membership is vast and heterogeneous. Sole practitioners, partners in Big
Six firms and finance directors of public companies, have little in common
except their member-ship of the institute and shared memories of the rigours
of the training contract.
The institute fulfils a number of different and not necessarily consistent
roles. It is a training body committed to maintaining excellence in new
entrants into the profession; a trade association, lobbying for the
interests of its members; and a disciplinary body, concerned to preserve the
highest professional standards among its members.
Increasingly, under first the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Financial Services
Act of the same year, and now the Companies Act 1989, it is a regulator as
well.
To the dispassionate observer, it is not clear that all these aims and
objectives are consistent with one another. The greatest conflict is between
its role as trade association and its new function as regulator.
Acting in what it then perceived to be the best interests of British
accountants, the institute originally lobbied against the requirement for
auditors to be monitored under the Companies Act 1989. It lost the argument
 -and is now fighting to be approved by the government as the body
responsible for doing the monitoring.
The ICAEW believes that its new regulatory responsibilities take precedence
over its trade-association functions, and in this it is undoubtedly sincere.
But the more vigorously it monitors its member firms, the more it risks
alienating them.
There is already one senior partner of a Big Six firm who privately says he
is so disillusioned with the institute that he would rather the monitoring
be taken over by a government agency like the Securities and Exchange
Commission in the US. After more than a century of self-regulation, this is
a heretical position to take, even in private.
Perhaps this is a tribute to the vigilance with which the ICAEW is carrying
out its new duties. But it is also a warning: to command respect of the
profession, the ICAEW must not get lost in internal politics. The abolition
of the president's advisory committee would be a good first step.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Battle line challenge for Tory
strategists - The state of the parties as they face the local election
contests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ONE safe bet for today's local elections throughout England and Wales is
that all three major parties will seek to glean some comfort from the
results and will probably succeed in doing so.
The outcome is unlikely to be clear-cut. However, it should give
Conservative party strategists all the information they need to decide
whether to recommend going to the country in June.
With no contests in Scotland, Northern Ireland and greater London, the
results will cover 475 of the UK's 650 parliamentary constituencies,
including those in the most keenly fought areas with many marginal seats, so
the elections represent the last big test of public opinion available to
ministers.
There are full council elections in 185 English shire districts, and a third
of the council is being contested in the remaining 111 and in the 36
metropolitan authorities.
In Wales, there are full elections for 33 district councils, with a third of
the seats being contested in the other four.
The Tories are defending around 5,200 seats and Labour 3,075. The Liberals
took 1,276 seats in 1987 and the now-defunct SDP 468. Independents won 2,094
seats and Plaid Cymru 89.
Two battles are being fought in the 12,000 council seats at stake, one for
seats and council control and the other for share of the vote - the issue
that will decide whether there is to be an early general election.
Last time, Labour won 31 per cent of the vote, the Tories 40 per cent and
the SDP-Liberal Alliance 27 per cent.
On the face of it, it is the Conservatives who are under pressure. Their
1983 and 1987 results saw net gains of 113 and 78 seats respectively, and
were good enough to trigger a successful June election.
But circumstances have changed considerably since 1987, partly because of
the mess the government has made of the poll tax and partly because of the
likely fall in the Liberal Democratic vote. A crucial element of tonight's
results will be how much of the former Alliance vote remains with the
Liberal Democrats and the distribution of the remainder.
The Conservatives' relatively good performance last time makes net gains
unlikely even if the announcement of plans for a property based council tax
has succeeded in neutralising the adverse effect of the poll tax.
The Tories could afford to lose 200 to 250 seats and a handful of councils
and still justifiably regard the outcome as a success, if the distribution
of votes is favourable.
The loss of 500 seats or more would be bad news both for Mr John Major's
standing as party leader and for the party's general election prospects.
Labour seems certain to make net gains because of its poor performance on
the last occasion.
But it needs to gain well over 300 seats to justify its present standing in
the opinion polls and to maintain the prospect of a general election
victory.
All the major parties will be studying especially carefully results from
three areas - the north-west and the west and east Midlands, where there are
clusters of Tory-held marginals.
In north-west England, the Tories hope the proposal to introduce the council
tax will help in previously low-rated areas such as Pendle and West
Lancashire, where there has been fierce opposition to the high levels of
poll tax.
The Midlands will see a key contest in Nottingham, which the Tories took in
1987 but where a minority Labour administration now relies on a former
Communist turned Green for control. Labour could take Derby from the Tories
on a good swing and gain control of hung Peterborough.
Elsewhere, Labour will want to take control of Exeter, currently hung, and
keep control of Milton Keynes where an additional Parliamentary seat is
being carved out.
More councils look likely to change to no overall control rather than switch
between parties if the Tories do badly, particularly where only a third of
seats are at stake.
The Liberal Democrats, who usually poll much better in local elections than
their standing in opinion polls would indicate, hope to demonstrate local
strength in several places of parliamentary interest.
They could gain Eastbourne, scene of their spectacular by-election victory
last year, and Cheltenham, and fend off Tory counter-attacks in hung
councils such as Bath, Chelmsford and Hastings.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour claims Tories planned '14
bands' - Council Taxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR CLAIMED yesterday that a leaked document giving details of a
valuation exercise proved that the government had originally intended to
make the council tax more progressive by spreading it over 14 bands.
The party said that the paper also undermined the government figures
published last week for bills under the new property-based tax, by exposing
the flaws in the basis of the calculations.
Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, said that the Valuation
Office circular showed that in February the government had been considering
a council tax system in which the top band would have been over Pounds
500,000 instead of the Pounds 160,000-plus it was announced as last week.
'We now know they took a conscious decision to abandon the earlier scheme. .
.which would have made the wealthy pay a fairer contribution,' he said.
Its unfairness was demonstrated, he said, by the fact that people in the
lowest band of property in four out of five English councils would face
higher bills than that to be paid by Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment
secretary, in Westminster.
Mr David Blunkett, the opposition local government spokesman, said that not
only did the valuation cover 14 bands instead of seven, but that the limits
on the two sets of bands did not coincide.
Valuers had been asked merely to 'estimate' the percentage of housing stock
falling into each band, instead of using statistical sampling techniques.
The government's calculations were 'inventions based on guesstimates'.
Downing Street said that a number of options had been looked at during the
poll tax review. A 14-band system would have been very complex and there
would have been only a small number of houses in upper bands above that on
which the government had decided.
The department of the environment also emphasised the amount higher-rate
taxpayers contributed through income tax to the costs of local government.
It added that the 14-band property valuation had been used to find averages
and work outwards from them, rather than as the basis for making assumptions
about how properties would be spread within different ranges.

THE government has accepted that the work of the Lord Chancellor's
Department and of government law officers should be subject to investigation
by the Commons' Home Affairs select committee.
Mr John MacGregor said yesterday that changes to standing orders would be
proposed to allow the select committee to scrutinise the administration of
courts and tribunals. Individual cases and prosecution policy would be
excluded.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Sponsorship of TV relay 'ludicrous'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL sponsorship of television footage from the Commons would be
'ludicrous' Mr Bruce Grocott, shadow deputy leader of the house said
yesterday.
He condemned the idea, considered by the select committee on broadcasting,
as 'horrendous' envisaging the day that Hansard, the public gallery and Mr
Speaker would bear company logos.
Mr Grocott also called on the government to pay for dedicated, continuous
coverage of parliament rather than a satellite or cable channel.
Mr John MacGregor, leader of the House, confirmed that a scheme by United
Artists should be pursued as the 'most thoroughly worked out and immediately
practicable' plan for broadcasting proceedings.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Political Notebook: A quiet weekend for Mr Patten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Chris Patten will not be travelling to Chequers this weekend clutching
his computer printouts of the local election results.
Instead, we are assured, he will enjoy a birthday dinner with his wife and
daughters before spending a couple of days with friends in Yorkshire. (The
celebration is a week early but party chairmen are too busy to be
over-precise about these things).
Mr Patten has good reason to avoid the television crews who tend to camp
outside the prime minister's official country residence.
When Mr Cecil Parkinson took the results of that year's local elections to
Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1983, the decision to call an early general
election had all but been been taken.
It was the same when Mr Norman Tebbit made his much-publicised pilgrimage in
1987. There is no such certainty now.
If Mr Patten were to follow their example he would probably find himself
sneaking out of the back door on Sunday afternoon with a less than
triumphant message for waiting reporters.
Unless today's results defy all expectations he would have to say something
like this: 'Um. .we are optimistic, the results were much better than last
year. But they are not quite good enough yet. Let's watch the opinion polls
and see what happens in the Monmouth by-election'.
The headlines in Monday's newspapers would read: 'Major AND Patten dither
over election timing'.
So what we can expect instead is a quiet telephone chat with Mr Major on
Sunday morning followed by Downing Street guidance that the prime minister
is far too busy to waste time speculating about the election date. To delay
is much better than to dither.
******
The prospect then is that for the next few weeks and, much more likely,
months we will all be in the thrall of the opinion polls - the result on May
16 in Monmouth is unlikely to be any more decisive than the local elections.
A newly-published history of British opinion polling* provides both Mr Major
 -and the commentators attempting to second-guess him - with a salutary
reminder of the risks of relying too heavily on these snapshots of the
public mood.
Mr Robert Worcester of Mori explains how the science has moved on since
Gallup broke new ground in 1937 by asking the British public whether, if
pushed, they would prefer Fascist or Communist rule (51 per cent opted for
the hammer and sickle against 49 per cent for the swastika, but 46 per cent
were pioneers of that difficult 'don't know' category).
He recalls that what is the now-traditional Liberal by-election tactic of
trying to swing voters by publishing favourable canvass returns was first
seen in the 1951 general election.
The Liberals leaked poll findings referring to the '38 per cent of the
electorate who would vote Liberal if they thought they really could have a
Liberal government'.
But the book reminds us also of the first and second rules of interpreting
opinion polls.
They are a device for assessing opinion not for forecasting behaviour; just
as importantly, the results reflect that opinion only at the time the poll
is taken.
For much of the 1980s, the health warnings were ignored. In 1983 and 1987,
public support for the Tories was sufficiently high - and solid - for Mrs
Thatcher to be confident that snapshots of opinion in the run-up to the
elections provided a reasonable proxy for behaviour on polling day.
But the best comparisons now are those with the late 1960s and early 1970s
rather than those with the 1980s.
The swings in opinion over the past two years mirror those between 1966 and
1970 when the then Mr Harold Wilson was alternately 20 points behind and
then 20 points ahead.
The most worrying parallel for Mr Major is with the spring of 1970 when Mr
Wilson was encouraged by his lead in the polls into calling a June election.
That apparent lead lasted for the whole of the campaign. But he lost to Mr
Edward Heath. Mr Heath in turn was to be similarly misled by private opinion
polls into seeking a new mandate in February 1974.
******
Mr Patten has his own reasons for being sceptical about the elaborate and
expensive computer projections which will follow the local election results.
The printouts that Mr Tebbit took to Chequers in 1987 predicted confidently
that although the Conservatives were heading for a landslide nationally Mr
Patten would lose his Bath seat by 5,000 votes. He won it by 1,400.

FT  02 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Teachers vote against test boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIMARY school teachers yesterday overwhelmingly rejected a boycott of
standard assessment tests for seven-year-olds in a ballot conducted by the
National Union of Teachers.
The result removes the threat of widespread disruption in primary schools
after a ballot was proposed at the NUT conference in Scarborough last month.
Standard assessment tasks (SATs) are already in progress in schools. Only
968 primary school teachers voted for a boycott, with 6,939 (88 per cent)
against. The response was about 65 per cent.
A separate ballot of all NUT members showed 86 per cent of those voting to
be in favour of a national campaign against testing (44,623 to 7,310).
However, only 27 per cent of NUT members voted, and the campaign is to be
limited to lobbying parents, head teachers and school governors, and will
not include industrial action.
Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said: 'The decision not to boycott
tests this year should not be taken as indicating any weakening in our
resolve to achieve the abolition of these tests.'
Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, welcomed the ballot result, and
said: 'As I have made clear, we will look closely at the experience of
administering the tests this year to see whether they need to be made
simpler.'
The vote by the NUT, the largest teachers' union in England and Wales,
clears the way for legislation covering the government's proposed review
body for teachers' pay, currently before the House of Commons.
Mr Clarke has made establishment of the body conditional upon teaching
unions not taking strike action. None of the five other teaching unions has
expressed support for a boycott of testing.

FT  02 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Business seen to dominate Tecs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) have become more
dominated by private-sector chief executives than the government originally
envisaged, according to one of the first detailed analyses of their
membership.
The Apex Trust says three quarters of Tec board members have been drawn from
the private sector. The government said at least two thirds of Tec boards
should be drawn from the private sector.
The trust, which runs training schemes for ex-offenders, said yesterday that
Department of Employment figures for 79 of the 82 Tecs in England and Wales
showed that 722 of the 945 board members were from the private sector. Only
210 members (22.2 per cent) were from the public sector and from unions
while 13 members (1.4 per cent) came from the voluntary sector. The figures
do not include the chairmen of Tec boards or their chief executives.
There has been controversy among unions about their low representation on
Tec boards. The Scottish Trades Union Congress last month voted to consider
boycotting their Scottish equivalents if union representation did not rise.
The Department of Employment said it believed that 675 of the 1,006 board
members, including chairmen, from the first 74 Tecs were from the private
sector. But Apex Trust said it had examined the background of each Tec
member.
Although there was some discontent among unions about participation in Tecs
when they were set up, the TUC has encouraged unions to participate.
The TUC said it wanted Tecs to be reformed to represent their local areas
more accurately. It said that if employer representation had increased
beyond the original proportion, it would be a matter for concern.
Mr Bill Mather, chairman of the Apex Trust, said the low representation of
voluntary- sector bodies was very disturbing.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Stores' legal skirmishes likely to continue: An Appeal Court
decision making the law 'virtually unenforceable'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE shops are likely to open this Sunday as a result of Tuesday's Appeal
Court judgment. But the long-running Sunday trading debate looks as though
it will stagger on for many months to come.
The Appeal Court ruling that councils could not ban Sunday opening at
specific shops without guaranteeing to meet sales losses if a court
eventually ruled against the ban may have meant the 1950 Shops Act is
'virtually unenforceable', but it still does not change the fundamental law
in England and Wales, as Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary,
pointed out yesterday.
No new legislation is going to emanate from the government this side of a
general election to clarify the situation, and the two camps will therefore
have to continue their skirmishes through the courts and the newspaper
columns.
The great unknown in the debate is how any repeal of the law would affect
the number of shops trading on Sundays. Would a change in the law open the
floodgates?
The Keep Sunday Special Campaign (KSSC) argues that unrestricted Sunday
trading would lead to higher prices and a reduction of competition as a
result of the eclipse of the smaller independent traders.
It points to an Institute for Fiscal Studies report from 1985 which
suggested that longer opening hours would be likely to accelerate the trend
of the disappearance of the independent retailer.
The KSSC also refers to a speech made by Baroness Young, a non-executive
director of Marks and Spencer, in the House of Lords in 1989, when she
argued that Sunday trading would only mean that six days' trading would be
spread over seven days.
A 1989 report on the implications of Sunday trading, released by the
free-market Adam Smith Institute, suggested that any changes in retailing as
a result of Sunday trading were likely to be evolutionary rather than
revolutionary.
It accepted small traders might be squeezed, but questioned if this would be
a bad thing. 'All economic change must involve, of necessity, gainers and
losers. Small shopkeepers would lose, but consumers would gain from lower
prices or more attractive shopping environments,' it said.
A study of the Swedish experience of 20 years of Sunday trading confirms the
impression that some smaller players find difficulty in competing.
In Sweden about 80 per cent of all department stores and hypermarkets now
open on Sundays, compared with the 22 per cent that opened in 1972 when
trading restrictions were first repealed.
Over that period, the hypermarkets and larger supermarkets have increased
their share of the market, as have the small convenience stores. The
medium-sized shops have been squeezed in between.
But the report, which was challenged by the trade unions, showed that
deregulated shopping hours had led to 'increased downward pressure' on
consumer prices.
Mr Kevin Hawkins, corporate affairs director for WH Smith, the multiple
retailer that jointly owns the 220-store Do-It-All chain with Boots, said
that as a result of the Appeal Court judgment it would open those stores
where it had previously undertaken not to trade.
'Where we have closed a store we have found that the trade we lose on a
Sunday is not recouped on any other day of the week. It is purely
discretionary trade which knocks on the head the view that there is just so
much money that can go around,' Mr Hawkins said.
'If we had complete freedom it would be a case of suck it and see. The
important thing is that we would be able to open and close according to
consumer demand - which would vary seasonally and locally.'

FT  02 MAY 91 / Environment warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOURISM industry was warned yesterday that it must tackle the problem of
'tourist blight' on the environment if it was to survive and prosper, writes
David Churchill.
Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said: 'The glittering prospects
that the tourism industry has will be tarnished unless it takes its
responsibilities to the environment seriously.'
He was speaking in London yesterday after publication of a working party's
report on tourism and the environment. The party, which was drawn from all
sides of the industry, urged greater contribution to schemes to help protect
the environment from excessive numbers of tourists and developments.
Consumers are suspicious that manufacturers are making environmental claims
to push up prices, says a survey published yesterday by the Mintel research
group.

FT  02 MAY 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Confusion over County guarantee -
Court Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER County NatWest director yesterday told the Blue Arrow trial that
his memory was confused over any guarantee given by County to County NatWest
Securities, its market-making co-subsidiary, in connection with CNWS's Blue
Arrow stake taken in the 1987 rights issue.
Mr James Riddell, then County's financial control director, first told the
court he had always believed that no guarantee had been given to CNWS.
However, he was challenged by Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, prosecuting, about
references to a guarantee in notes he had written in early November 1987
after discussions with Mr Alan Keat, a solicitor with Travers Smith
Braithwaite and one of the defendants.
Asked why he had written that a guarantee could not be given to normal
market-making stock, Mr Riddell said he did not know. He then said that it
was an 'overall statement' which did not go into detail.
Later he said: 'You have demonstrated that at the beginning of November I
knew that there was one, but the significance of it did not impinge upon
me.'
Mr Purnell also challenged Mr Riddell on another note written after the
discussion with Mr Keat. This said if CNWS had a guarantee its holding could
no longer be regarded as trading stock, the market-makers exemption from
disclosure would not apply and aggregation would follow.
Mr Riddell said he had not considered aggregation was an issue because
appropriate legal advice had been taken. He had been looking at the matter
in an accounting framework, rather than a legal context.
Later, he told Mr Purnell he had understood the guarantee covered any losses
in bonuses earned by CNWS traders.
Mr Riddell also said that in his discussions with Mr Keat about the
end-of-year accounts, he had considered transferring shares from County to
NatWest, the parent bank. Asked about a discussion concerning the possible
backdating of the documentation for this, Mr Riddell said Mr Keat had told
him such tampering with documents was a criminal offence.
County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and
seven individuals all deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the
outcome of the Pounds 837m issue.
The trial continues today.

FT  02 MAY 91 / SIB agrees to relax rules on unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Investments Board has bowed to pressure from investment
managers and substantially relaxed earlier proposals for rules which will
govern unit trusts specialising in futures and options.
Final rules published yesterday lay down less stringent investment
guidelines than draft regulations published in December. The SIB said it did
not expect further amendments to the proposals before they passed into law
later this year.
Yesterday's document follows earlier proposals by classifying futures and
options funds as either low-risk funds or higher-risk 'geared' funds.
However, the investment regulations relating to geared funds have been
substantially relaxed.
The SIB had proposed to limit the amount a geared fund could invest in
futures and options to 10 per cent of its total assets. That limit has now
been raised to 20 per cent of total assets, with the rest of the fund
invested in cash or highly liquid securities.
In addition, the earlier rules proposed limiting to 4 per cent of total
assets the amount a geared fund could invest in any one category of futures
and options - equity, currency or commodity derivatives, for example. This
strict capping of exposure to any one market has been dropped. Instead,
investment managers will be obliged to 'exercise reasonable prudence in
relation to the diversification' of investment.
This does not apply to derivative products, such as futures contracts based
on an index of stocks, which are 'by their nature already broadly
diversified'.
This opens the way to funds based on index futures such as the FT-SE 100
index future quoted on the London International Financial Futures Exchange.
The changes have pleased many investment managers, but prompted bitter
complaints from others in the unit trust industry who fear that more risky
futures and options funds will give the industry a bad name.
Even firms enthusiastic about the new regulations said they hoped that the
rules governing marketing would be strict.
Members of the International Stock Exchange voted at an extraordinary
general meeting yesterday to defer elections to the exchange's council until
the autumn, allowing a reorganisation of the council membership to take
place.
They also voted to allow the council to transfer the business and assets of
the London Traded Options Market, owned by the exchange, to the London
International Financial Futures Exchange.
The two markets are due to merge later this year.

FT  02 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Independent on Sunday staff voice
fears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JOURNALISTS on The Independent newspaper met yesterday amid growing
uncertainty over the future of the loss-making Independent on Sunday.
They called on the management of Newspaper Publishing, the company that
publishes both newspapers, to consult fully with journalists over any change
of plan that might affect working practices.
Yesterday's union meeting was in response to a management meeting to
consider options for cutting costs. It is believed that one option raised
was closer integration of the daily and Sunday titles - in effect creating a
seven-days-a-week operation similar to the Daily and Sunday Telegraphs.
The Independent on Sunday, launched in January 1990, is understood to be
selling about 370,000 copies a week but is losing heavily because of the
advertising recession. The Independent itself is believed to be modestly
profitable.
There have even been unconfirmed rumours that the Independent on Sunday
might be up for sale.

offer.
British Rail indicated that it was prepared to agree to attend talks at the

Aslef, the drivers' union, has also asked for arbitration over a similar
offer.
The RMT, the largest rail workers' union, is recommending members to vote

FT  02 MAY 91 / Ruling on late VAT payment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSISTENT DELAY by customers in settling debts can provide businesses with
a reasonable excuse for not paying value added tax on time, the High Court
ruled yesterday.
Mr Justice Kennedy upheld a decision by a VAT tribunal to cancel surcharges
imposed by the Commissioners of Customs on Mr John Steptoe, an electrical
contractor of Barkingside, Essex, for late payment of VAT.
Judge Medd, QC, tribunal chairman, had said 95 per cent of Mr Steptoe's work
was for Redbridge council in London, which, in 1987-88, was 'an extremely
slow payer'. Mr Steptoe been left without sufficient funds to meet VAT
bills.
Judge Medd said this was 'one of those rare cases' where the taxpayer might
legitimately put forward as a reasonable excuse 'the un-expected and
continuing conduct' of the person who caused the prolonged shortage of
funds.
Dismissing an appeal by the commissioners, Mr Justice Kennedy said the
question of what could be regarded as a reasonable excuse in such cases
could safely be left to the discretion of VAT tribunals.

FT  02 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Agency attacks funding of courses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP attack on government funding of training was made last night by the
Business and Technician Education Council (BTEC), the largest validating
body of vocational courses in England and Wales.
Mr John Sellars, BTEC chairman, told the Commons employment committee that
the Department of Employment had refused to fund BTEC courses through the
Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs).
He said: 'This is effectively blocking many young people from taking their
first step on the training ladder, and not meeting demand for training.'
To attract Department of Employment funding through the Tecs, courses must
be approved by the department's Training, Enterprise and Education division.
'At present', Mr Sellars told MPs, 'BTEC programmes are not on this list,
and some training organisations who prefer to offer our qualifications are
unable to do so, particularly at first level.'
BTEC first level is equivalent to five GCSE passes.
Mr Sellars also called on the government to draw up a national strategy to
extend vocational training into the workplace.
'We believe that a vocational education and training dimension must not only
be introduced into the formal education system, but also extended into the
employment environment', he said. 'In-creased recognition of the value of
these qualifications to individuals and the economy must start from the top,
ie government'.
About half a million students are studying BTEC programmes. Registrations
have risen by 40 per cent since 1985.

FT  02 MAY 91 / QC says Lloyd's fudged discipline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUTHORITIES at Lloyd's of London insurance market were guilty of 'part
retreat and part fudge' in enforcing their own disciplinary procedures, the
High Court was told yesterday.
Mr Michael Lyndon-Stanford, QC, representing 24 members of syndicates
formerly managed by the Oakeley Vaughan underwriting agency, now in
liquidation, alleged that Lloyd's had failed to protect Names from the
consequences of mismanagement at Oakeley Vaughan.
Late in 1981 the Committee of Lloyd's found Mr Charles St George unfit to
continue to manage the Oakeley Vaughan underwriting agency.
The committee instructed Mr St George to reduce his voting shares in the
agency to not more than 10 per cent, and to relinquish management control.
In what Mr Lyndon-Stanford described as 'complete disdain' of the
committee's instructions, Mr St George wrote to Mr Peter Green, the then
chairman of Lloyd's, at the end of 1981 declaring he was making himself
managing director of the agency. He took no steps to reduce his voting
shares.
Mr Lyndon-Stanford said the Committee of Lloyd's had subsequently failed to
enforce its instructions to Mr St George. This was 'most regrettable' - even
taking into account that Mr St George and other members of his family 'were
not easy people to deal with'.
The court was given details of a lengthy series of meetings among committee
members of Lloyd's during 1982, in which the problems of Oakeley Vaughan
were discussed. The need for a chief executive, other than Mr St George, to
run the agency was repeatedly stressed.
Oakeley Vaughan was given a deadline of September 30 1982 for the new
appointment. The deadline passed with no chief executive being appointed, Mr
Lyndon-Stanford said.
The case continues today.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Relief as modern work takes record: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were sighs of relief at Sotheby's in New York on Tuesday night when
Rebus, a painting by Robert Rauschenberg, sold for Dollars 7.26m (Pounds
4.2m), a record for this contemporary American artist.
The canvas, painted in 1955, is an anthology of modern art, incorporating
dripped paint, collage, comic strip, photography, graffiti, and more. Rebus
last appeared at Sotheby's little more than two years ago, when it was sold
to Mr Hans Thulin, a Swedish industrialist, for Dollars 6.3m. It signalled
the arrival of contemporary art as a lucrative market.
Since then prices, and Mr Thulin's fortunes, have declined. He and Sotheby's
were taking a gamble by offering Rebus again so prematurely. The buyer was
Mr Larry Gagosian, a New York dealer who often acts for Mr Charles Saatchi,
a director of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. In spite of the financial difficulties of
the company, in which he is a significant shareholder, Mr Saatchi has
recently been busily buying the big names of modern art, paying Dollars
3.08m for Third Time Painting by Rauschenberg at Sotheby's last November.
To finance his acquisitions, Mr Saatchi is selling the minimalist and
neo-expressionist art that he acquired in the 1970s. He is disposing of
about 30 paintings in the New York auction rooms this week, and sold four at
Sotheby's on Tuesday - two works by Cy Twombly and two by Philip Guston, and
a Brice Marden.
The auction totalled Dollars 21.256m for 68 lots, with 18 per cent by value
unsold. One of the Saatchi Twombly's called Untitled made Dollars 2.2m and
the other, Untitled Grey Painting, Dollars 880,000. Both sold below
estimate, suggesting that although buyers - mainly US private collectors and
German dealers - were bidding, they were not prepared to pay the prices of a
year ago.
The results were more depressing at Sotheby's auction of modern British art
in London yesterday which totalled Pounds 906,180, but with 37.5 per cent
unsold.
Of two paintings by Stanley Spencer, one, The Baptism, sold within estimate
for Pounds 462,000. But the other, Hilda and I at Burghclere, was unsold at
Pounds 190,000. Mr David Kerr, a dealer, paid a record Pounds 60,500 for a
work by John Craxton - Boy, Girl and Cat, dated 1948.

IT MAY BE 1991, but Mary-lebone Cricket Club last night voted against, as
one member put it, 'moving into the 20th, let alone into the 21st century'.
The MCC, the world's most famous cricket club and the sport's former
governing body, voted not to admit women as either full or honorary members.
Ms Rachael Heyhoe Flint, the former England women's cricket captain who
started all the fuss, did - in the words of MCC secretary Lieut-Col John
Stephenson - 'bowl a fast one'.
Encouraged by Lt-Col Stephenson's admission last year that there was nothing
in the club's constitution spec-ifically preventing women from joining, Ms
Heyhoe Flint put in a request for a membership form signed only 'R. Flint',
but backed by some weighty figures in the cricket world.
But MCC members answered Ms Heyhoe Flint with a firm defensive stroke,
rejecting by 4,727 votes to 2,371 a motion to amend the rules to allow women
members.
'The word 'chauvinist' was mentioned,' Lt-Col Stephenson said after the
meeting.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Court move on Nigerian bank's debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE High Court has appointed a receiver to recover the Dollars 250,000
(Pounds 145,000) balance of a Dollars 2.7m debt owed by Mercantile Bank of
Nigeria, a leading Nigerian bank.
Last December the court made a sequestration order against the bank for its
contempt of court in failing to disclose its assets.
The disclosure order was made when Minerva Securities (CI), a Channel
Islands commodity trader, sought to enforce a Dollars 1,254,977 judgment
against Mercantile in 1982.
The writ of sequestration was discharged in January when Mercantile Bank
made disclosure. Minerva has since recovered the bulk of the Dollars 2.7m it
is owed.
The judgment was based on a 1978 letter of undertaking by Mercantile Bank to
pay Dollars 1,254,977 in exchange for the release of shipping documents.
Lengthy litigation followed in Nigeria when Mercantile challenged the
judgment, ending in February last year when the Nigerian Supreme Court set
aside an Appeal Court ruling nullifying the judgment.
The receiver is Mr Geoffrey Holroyd, of Wheawill and Sudworth, the
accountancy firm.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Scots see no sign of upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S economy may have passed the moment of steepest decline in the
current recession. That is the view of the latest quarterly survey conducted
by chambers of commerce throughout Scotland and interpreted by the Fraser of
Allander Institute at Strathclyde University.
It adds that there is no sign of an upturn, and shows a continuing downward
trend in orders and sales in all sectors except for wholesale distribution.
The survey says demand for manufactured goods in England is depressed, but
that export markets are holding up better. It speaks of a relative
improvement in general business optimism, though levels are still low. The
improvement is attributed to the ending of the Gulf war and the fall in
interest rates, and is not matched by companies' reported sales and orders.
Much of the increased optimism is reported in Glasgow, but the Aberdeen area
shows the greatest buoyancy thanks to the oil industry's strength.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Bush backs bank reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chances of wide-ranging bank reform in the US improved last night after
President George Bush gave his backing to a comprehensive package and
Democratic leaders of the House banking committee agreed to allow more time
for debate on such proposals, Peter Riddell writes.
It is still unlikely that all of the US Treasury's far-reaching proposals
will be approved in view of widespread congressional caution.
Last night's move gives a chance for Mr Nicholas Brady, the treasury
secretary, to press his case, backed by the key banking regulators, for
comprehensive action now to permit banks to open nationwide branch networks
and to engage in financial service activities.
In his first comments on the issue for several weeks, Mr Bush said the US
should bring its banking system into the 21st century 'so that our banks can
fuel economic growth. But in order to do that, we need comprehensive reform,
not just a quick and narrow fix'.
Sir Leon Brittan, vice-president of the European Commission, last night
wrote to Mr Brady and to key committee chairmen expressing his strong
support for the liberalising thrust of the Treasury's plan.
However, he warned that the ability of EC banks to compete in the US market
would be severely limited by the requirement that foreign banks must operate
through a subsidiary to engage also in securities and insurance activities.

<TEXT>
TALKS ARE to resume between Britain and China soon - possibly next week - in
a final attempt to break the deadlock over Hong Kong's plans to construct a
HKDollars 100bn (Pounds 7.5bn) airport, which would be opened soon after the
colony returns to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
There is no sign of any new initiative from either side, but both countries
favour a resumption.
If the talks fail it is likely Hong Kong businessmen will quickly submit a
private sector-led plan as a catalyst to save the project, possibly by
creating a consortium that could include the Hong Kong and Chinese
governments. This might enable the two governments to move away from
entrenched positions.
Several of the colony's top business names - including Mr Li Ka-shing and
the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank - are holding private talks. But no plan will
be proposed unless there is deadlock at a diplomatic level.
Mr Gordon Wu, a Hong Kong entrepreneur, held discussions in Peking 10 days
ago with senior officials about plans he has been promoting for five years.
This infuriated the Hong Kong government, which has secured pledges from Mr
Wu and other local businessmen that they will not make further moves for the
time being.

ONE OF two UK-based companies on a US Treasury blacklist expressed surprise
last night at being named as one of the 'entities and agents of the
government of Libya'.
The company's comments follow publication on Tuesday of a list of 48
organisations, mostly based in Arab and Mediterranean countries, which the
Treasury Office of Foreign Assets and Control named as circumventing the US
embargo against Libya.
'We abide by British laws 100 per cent,' said Dr M Ageli, chief executive of
the Libyan-owned Umm Al-Jawaby Oil Service Company, of Cavendish Square,
London. He said the company cleared any trade with the Department of Trade
and Industry and had never had trading links with US corporations.
The second UK company named, Arabian Gulf Oil Company (Agoco) of Windsor
House, Victoria Street, London, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of National Oil
Corporation (Libya). It could not be contacted for comment.
The DTI said there was no embargo on British companies trading with Libya,
except under the provisions of the Export of Goods Control Order.

PRINCE Sadruddin Aga Khan, who is in charge of United Nations relief

police in northern Iraq to protect Kurdish refugees when he returns to
Baghdad shortly, diplomats said last night, Michael Littlejohns writes from
the UN.
A UN spokeswoman confirmed that the plan, proposed by Mr John Major, the UK
prime minister, was among matters discussed by senior UN officials in Geneva
under the prince's chairmanship.
Also in Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was
setting up seven reception camps to accommodate 100,000 refugees along
Iran's frontier with Iraq.
Discussions on the British plan also continued in New York yesterday.
According to his office, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, UN secretary general,
still was undecided about it. He is believed to have sought UN legal advice.
In northern Iraq allied forces ordered President Saddam Hussein's troops out
of new areas to enlarge the safe havens for refugees.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Iraq 'promises multi-party poll': Ruling council to be
scrapped, Kurdish leader claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A KURDISH leader claimed last night that Iraqi officials had agreed to
abolish the ruling Revolutionary Command Council and hold multi-party
elections within six months.
Jalal Talabani, a member of the Iraqi Kurdistan Front which has been holding
talks with Baghdad on Kurdish autonomy, told the BBC from his base in
northern Iraq that 'a freely-elected parliament will function instead of all
other bodies'.
The Iraqi government has been promising in recent weeks to introduce more
democratic systems but has not previously outlined specific proposals nor
suggested scrapping the Revolutionary Command Council, which is essentially
an instrument of the ruling Ba'ath party.
There was no confirmation of the report from Baghdad. The ruling party has
come close to admitting that it has failed to address ethnic and sectarian
problems but an official announcement of plans to democratise the country
would still be treated sceptically by many Iraqis, given the history of
repression at the hands of the Ba'ath party. Party officials were seized and
killed during the unsuccessful Kurdish and Shia rebellion against President
Saddam Hussein in March following the Gulf war.
Concessions to democracy in Baghdad would be regarded as a big step forward
by Kurds in their battle for autonomy.
Jalal Talabani also said he had won an amnesty for Kurdish and Shia
prisoners captured during the rebellion.
He said last week agreement in principle had been reached with Baghdad on
implementing a 1970 autonomy accord between the government and the Kurds,
who form a fifth of Iraq's 18m population. Distrustful of Mr Saddam, the
Kurds want international guarantees for any final agreement.

MR Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, arrived in Cairo last night
at the start of a four-nation trip designed to bolster US peace-making
efforts in the Middle East and to express concern over human rights
violations in Kuwait, Roger Matthews writes.
After talks today with Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid and President
Hosni Mubarak, Mr Hurd will travel on to Jordan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
before returning to London on Sunday.
Britain is broadly supportive of the efforts of Mr James Baker, the US
secretary of state, to convene a Middle East peace conference and by
visiting Amman Mr Hurd will be signalling the importance of Jordan in any
resolution of Palestinian demands for self-determination.
The attitude of King Hussein to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait has left a
coolness in relations between Amman and Washington which Britain would like
to be eased.
In Kuwait, Mr Hurd can be expected to add his weight to British efforts to
win a larger share of post-war reconstruction contracts, but will also be
blunt about international concern over persecution of non-Kuwaitis deemed to
have co-operated with the occupying Iraqi forces.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YEMENI authorities have detained a tanker managed by a California-based
company for alleged pollution caused after an accident in its waters.
The Mendana Spirit, managed by Western Marine, part of the Teekay Shipping
group, has been detained for 12 weeks in the port of Aden. Teekay's
insurers, the London-based Britannia P&amp;I Club, said the vessel's release was
dependent on the payment of several million dollars. Demands have ranged
from an initial Dollars 59m-Dollars 60m (Pounds 34.7m-Pounds 35.2m) to
Dollars 7.5m.
The 39,976 gross ton tanker is the third vessel to be held during the past
nine months on the same grounds by Yemen's recently formed Public
Corporation for Maritime Affairs.
Britannia said yesterday that in each case no actual pollution damage had
been proved. 'It appears the authorities in Aden are using mere allegations
of pollution damage as justification for the detention of ships in order to
extract heavy cash payments.'
Teekay operates a fleet of 60 tankers and is one of the world's largest
independent tanker operators.
The Mendana Spirit collided with a Turkish bulk carrier on February 10 but
lost none of its fuel or cargo, which was duly unloaded. The Turkish carrier
subsequently sank and some of its fuel escaped.

trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SOFIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BULGARIA is seeking new ways to finance and revive trade with the Soviet
Union, after this market and those of the former Comecon countries virtually
collapsed earlier this year.
But Bulgarian officials stress they do not want to be completely dependent
on the Soviet Union again, for fear their own enterprises will not make the
necessary adjustments to western markets.
Until 1989, 80 per cent of Bulgaria's total trade was with Comecon
countries, the Soviet Union accounting for 60 per cent, and eastern Europe,
20 per cent. In the first quarter of 1991, compared to the first quarter of
1990, Bulgaria's trade with the Soviet Union fell from 60 to 50 per cent,
and trade with eastern Europe, from 23 to 11 per cent.
Mr Atanas Paparizov, Minister for Foreign Economic Relations, believes trade
can be revived through a payments union, similar to the European Payments
Union set up in 1950 to break down the bilateral and quantitative controls
which marked trade in western Europe in the 1930s.
Largely financed by the US, this let currencies in western Europe be freely
transferable between each other, and provided credit to help settle each
country's monthly net position with other members.
Mrs Mariana Todorova, deputy minister for foreign economic relations, and Mr
Ivan Pushkarov, minister for industry and trade, oppose such an idea. 'A
Payments Union is redundant. We do not need to keep these relations as they
are. It means maintaining the old structures. Instead, we must restructure
our trade. We have to diversify,' Mrs Todorova said.
Mr Pushkarov believes privatisation and a new foreign investment law will
help shift Bulgaria's dependence away from the Soviet Union, enabling
Bulgaria to earn hard currency to pay for Soviet oil imports.
Trade with the Soviet Union collapsed partly because of the switch to hard
currency payments between itself and its former east European allies.
The Soviet Union reneged on its energy contracts with Bulgaria, whose
energy-intensive industrial sector depends on oil imports. Until 1989,
Bulgaria imported 11m tonnes of oil from the Soviet Union.
In 1990, deliveries fell 20 per cent, to 7.8m tonnes. Earlier this year, the
Soviet Union agreed to supply 5m tonnes for 1991, or 400,000 tonnes a month.
Bulgaria received only 200,000 tonnes for January and the same amount for
February.

FT  02 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Bush acts to beat N America trade pact
opponents
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSH Administration yesterday sought to shatter opposition to the North
American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) by sending to Congress a sweeping set
of promises to satisfy concerns over US job losses and the environment.
The Administration's 'action plan' was released one month before Congress
must vote if it is to defeat President Bush's request for 'fast track' trade
authority. The 'fast track' gives him a free hand to negotiate
amendment-free treaties in the Uruguay Round, and with Mexico and Canada.
'Fast track lets us open up new markets and new opportunities,' President
Bush told the Society of American Business Editors and Writers yesterday.
'Fast track is another term for good faith. It means we will not tinker with
trade agreements worked out by our negotiators and their foreign
counterparts.'
Good faith is what the President is striving to win from a Congress that has
often seen its tough trade laws ignored by the administration. Informal
polls have shown widespread uncertainty in both houses on whether to trust
the administration to negotiate a pact which would protect US workers,
health and safety rules, and the environment.
The AFL-CIO, the nation's biggest labour organisation and a leading Nafta
opponent, yesterday released the first national poll on the proposed pact.
It found 56 per cent of the American public believing that a US-Mexico pact
would result in job losses and 72 per cent opposed to granting 'fast-track'
authority.
Until yesterday, the anti-'fast track' coalition - environmentalists, farm,
labour and consumer groups, and textile and apparel makers, was thought to
be gaining in the House but to be behind in the Senate. A majority in either
house can deny the president 'fast-track' authority.
The 'action plan' contains concessions which may well satisfy many of the
undecided. It promises to consider long transitions before cutting tariffs
on import-sensitive products and to negotiate mechanisms which would
re-instate the tariffs if imports surge.
It pledges strict, clear rules of origin, especially for assembled
automotive products; an 'adequately funded' retraining programme for those
that lose jobs because of Nafta; negotiation of joint action plans with
Mexico on labour issues, including improved working conditions, child labour
law enforcement, and health and safety measures, to be implemented in
parallel with Nafta negotiations.
Environmentalists are promised positions on trade policy advisory
committees; a bi-national programme of co-operation on environmental issues;
and a plan to address air and water pollution, hazardous wastes, chemical
spills, pesticides and enforcement. Sen Max Baucus, Senate trade
sub-committee chairman, yesterday said the plan went 'a long way' to address
congressional concerns. But a system still had to be devised for monitoring
and enforcing Mexico's environmental pledges.

FT  02 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Swedes boost attack on US steel duties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SWEDEN has stepped up its attack on US anti-dumping duties on steel imports,
after Washington this week declined for the fourth time to implement a
ruling by a Gatt disputes panel.
The Swedes opened a new case by complaining to Gatt's anti-dumping committee
on Tuesday that the US was refusing to review anti-dumping duties imposed
almost 20 years ago on imports of stainless steel plate from Sweden.
Also, the Swedes charged the US was 'blatantly ignoring' Gatt's anti-dumping
code in pursuing a case against imports of anti-friction bearings from SKF,
the big Swedish roller bearings group. This case also involves German,
French and British exporters.
The message from Washington was that Gatt's rules for settling trade
disputes did not apply to the US, unless it wanted them to, a Swedish
Foreign Ministry official said. A disputes panel ruled last September that
the US had not followed Gatt anti-dumping rules when imposing duties on
imports of seamless stainless steel products from the Swedish company
Sandvik.
The US administration had acted at the request of only a few companies and
had not satisfied itself the request had been filed on behalf of the
domestic industry affected. The panel told the US to revoke the duty and
reimburse the company for more than Dollars 8m (Pounds 4.7m) it had already
paid.
The US administration has contested some of the panel's arguments,
challenged the panel's right to prescribe a specific remedy, and claims US
law prevents it complying with the panel's ruling.
Sweden asked for bilateral consultations - the first step to raising a
dispute in Gatt - with the US on the new dumping case. Avesta, one of the
biggest US domestic producers, had exhausted all the means available,
including the US Court of Appeals, to obtain a review of the anti-dumping
duties imposed in 1973, the Swedish official said.
Imports of hot rolled stainless steel plate from Sweden represented 0.2 per
cent of US consumption. In justifying the dumping charge in 1973, the US
contended the Swedes had maintained their exports to the US market during a
decline in demand for stainless steel plate in western Europe, their biggest
market.
Swedish exports to the EC grew 266 per cent between 1971 and 1985. Yet the
US authorities continued to argue that the information presented by Avesta
was insufficient to warrant a review of the dumping duties, the Swedish
official said. The US accepted the Swedish demand for consultations.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Fizz goes out of champagne exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHAMPAGNE exports have gone flat as recession, rising prices and the Gulf
crisis have taken the fizz out of buyers' appetite for high-priced bubbles.
Shipments to the British market - traditionally the largest export outlet
for champagne - halved in the first three months of this year, as total
exports fell by 28 per cent to 12.2m bottles.
Germany, whose champagne consumption has in the past run at little more than
half the UK's, was the only country to record higher shipments in the first
quarter, with a rise of 3 per cent to 2.6m bottles making it for the first
time champagne's biggest export market.
The shipment figures may be distorted by dealers' running down stocks. But
even the depletion figures, which reflect actual sales, are expected to show
that there has been a substantial slip in consumption.
'The first phenomenon is the Gulf: for the first three months of the year
the big hotels and restaurants of London, places like the Dorchester, were
virtually empty, and the same is true around the world in places like the
Mamounia in Morocco,' comments Mr Frederic Heidsieck, export director of
Louis Roederer.
Mr Heidsieck also fears that champagne prices in many countries may have
reached or exceeded the levels that the trade has long regarded as
psychological limits: Pounds 15, BFr1,000 or DM50 a bottle.
If these thresholds have as much power as some shippers fear, drinkers may
turn to the high quality sparkling wines now produced in countries like
Spain and Australia - often by traditional French houses in search of
diversification.
Grape in these countries cost only FFr2.50 or FFr5 a kilogram, whereas in
Champagne grapes rose last year to a minimum of FFr32 a kilo, following the
ending of a trade agreement that had governed prices for 30 years.
However, champagne makers are putting a brave face on the plunge in
shipments. They say that many brands raised their prices by 10 to 15 per
cent on January 1, so dealers who had stocked up before this increase
reduced their orders as they sold off their old stock.
'It is clear the champagne market is less easy than it was, but the
situation is still not dramatic, and in April we began to feel the first
tremors of a revival,' commented an official of Moet et Chandon, the
champagne market leader.
Mr Claude Taittinger, head of the champagne house that bears his name and
chairman of the federation of French wine and spirits exporters, says: 'The
first quarter was not good, but we are now entering a new phase with some
reassuring phenomena.'
In any case, dwindling demand will probably not force champagne prices down.
Frost, which hit around 30 per cent of the Champagne area's vineyards last
month, seems likely to curb this year's supply enough to prevent any price
slump - even if many of the affected vines may flower again, and even if the
worst of the frost was in the lower quality Aube and Aisne districts, not in
the grand cru areas of the Marne.

GERMANY'S population is split down the middle on whether Bonn or Berlin
should be the country's seat of government, writes David Goodhart. A poll
for Stern magazine, from a sample of 1,126, gives 48 per cent for Berlin, 46
per cent for Bonn, 6 per cent undecided.
In west Germany there is a majority of 55 per cent for Bonn and 40 per cent
for Berlin. In east Germany 82 per cent favour Berlin, 12 per cent Bonn.
Only 50 per cent of west Berliners and 70 per cent of east Berliners are for

The Bundestag will decide on June 20. Deputies are thought to be almost as

FT  02 MAY 91 / Efta sidetracked by the lure of EC membership: Joining the
Community is beginning to appeal more than a free trade zone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE growing signs that efforts to set up a free trade zone between the
European Community and the European Free Trade Association are doomed as
Efta members warm to the idea of seeking full EC membership instead.
For one thing, the European Economic Area talks themselves are deadlocked:
the Swiss are threatening to walk out and get on with applying for EC
membership; Iceland announced yesterday it would boycott the talks until the
EC stopped making 'unrealistic demands' about fishing jurisdiction; and
Sweden may apply as soon as next month to become a full Community member.
The next EC-Efta ministerial meeting is scheduled for May 13 in Brussels and
this could well turn into a make-or-break session. The original hope of
having a framework EEA (European Economic Area) agreement ready for Efta's
annual conference in Salzburg in June is looking doubtful.
The areas of division remain considerable. It is not only the issue of EC
access to the fishing grounds off Iceland and Norway that threatens to
paralyse negotiations. It is now clear the attempts at formulating joint
decision-making bodies to police the EEA have run into trouble, particularly
from the European Court in Luxembourg, which refuses to accept that Efta
judges should sit with it in ajudicating on breaches of EEA rules.
In fact, there has been an unreal quality to the EC-Efta talks for some
time. The EEA was first proposed by Mr Jacques Delors, the European
Commission president, in Strasbourg in January 1989 as a way of discouraging
individual Efta countries from applying for EC membership at a time when the
EC was concentrating on the speed-up of integration with the internal market
by 1992.
The Efta countries responded favourably to Mr Delors' initiative and both
sides met in Oslo in February 1989, where they agreed on negotiating an EEA,
however unclear that concept remained. But the original reasons for having
an EEA no longer seem so obvious as the pace of change has accelerated in
Europe.
Increasingly the EEA has been seen by many as a transition stage on the road
to full EC membership for the Efta countries and not a real alternative.
Austria was the first to break ranks and send in an EC membership
application in July 1989 though insisting it was still committed as a loyal
Efta member to the EEA negotiations.
But it was Sweden's sudden conversion last October to the idea of joining
the EC that really began to undermine the Efta position. At the time the
other Nordic states greeted the Swedish volte-face with a mixture of anger
and shock and insisted this did not affect their own outlook.
However, with Sweden's announcement yesterday that it would send in its EC
membership application in June, and the deadlock in the EEA talks, official
attitudes can be expected to continue in the Nordic glacial fashion - a slow
undercurrent for change to be followed by rapid acceptance of the new
orthodoxy.
Until last weekend politicians in Finland had remained adamant, except for a
few brave voices on the fringe, that the country - for historical reasons of
its neutrality and close relations with the Soviet Union - could not
consider joining the EC. For the Finns the EEA seemed the tailor-made answer
to their country's dilemma as a market economy increasingly dependent on EC
trade but requiring co-existence with whoever rules in the Kremlin.
In Finland's recent general election the EC question was studiously avoided
by all the parties. But last weekend former foreign minister Pentti Paasio,
a Social Democrat, broke ranks within hours of leaving office to say Finland
ought to consider applying to join the EC, while the new Centre-Conservative
coalition says it does not rule out such a move as long as the country's
national interests can be protected.
In Oslo the response has so far been more muted, but then Labour prime
minister Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland finds herself in a difficult position.
Her minority government, which came to power last November, is dependent for
its present position on the support of the anti-EC Centre Party.
Mrs Brundtland has said over and over that her Labour party - which is the
key to a Norwegian EC application - cannot decide its position until the
autumn of 1993 at its next conference and that the issue will have to be
resolved finally in the next Norwegian general election, which cannot take
place until September 1994.
Now there are signs that the government - under pressure from the opposition
Conservatives - will have to debate what to do as early as this summer,
particularly if the Efta-EC negotiations collapse. The trouble is that
public opinion remains volatile and evenly divided over EC membership and
memories of the bitter EC referendum campaign of 1972 continue to haunt
Norway's politicians.
The Nordic ice may be breaking on the issue, but it remains unclear as to
just how fast a pace the countries of the region intend to pursue it. But
all of them - except Iceland, for whom the fish question is non-negotiable -
are heading in the same direction.
Perhaps as early as January 1 1995, or soon afterwards, most of them may
well have joined the EC either together or separately. It is an outcome more
probable than a week ago, despite the obstacles that still lie in the way.

FT  02 MAY 91 / US denies Nato slowing EC progress on security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SLOW progress in the European Community's negotiations on common security is
not the fault of Nato, Mr William Taft, the US envoy to Nato, said
yesterday. He rejected a complaint by Mr Jacques Delors, the European
Commission president, that EC security discussions were being held up by the
slower pace of parallel work in Nato.
In an interview, the US ambassador said Nato had in fact delayed its
alliance summit from July to the autumn 'because this would co-ordinate
better with the work of the inter-governmental conferences' on a common EC
security stance and other issues.
'This (delay) was a consistent desire by the EC countries' that belong to
Nato, Mr Taft said, adding that 'perhaps Mr Delors was not aware of this'.
However, at last weekend's meeting of EC foreign ministers, Mr Delors' call
for Nato to speed up its talks was echoed by Mr Jacques Poos, Luxembourg's
foreign minister.
The real debate over European security now seems to be shifting from the EC
to Nato, to confront the arguments which are being put with increasing force
by the US and which are strongly supported by Community states like Britain
and the Netherlands.
'We have told the Europeans that in our view the development of a European
security identity ought to strengthen the alliance, not compete with it, nor
duplicate it,' said Mr Taft.
He said Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, stressed to EC foreign
ministers two weeks ago 'the essential character of Nato's integrated
military structure, the need to avoid marginalisation of any of the allies
(European countries outside the EC) and the desirability of the European
political union developing a capacity to engage beyond Europe's borders'.
Nato has agreed to boost its own rapid reaction force, but only for use
within alliance territory. The US, along with Britain and the Netherlands,
now sees a European rapid deployment force, acting probably under Western
European Union (WEU) auspices, as filling the 'out of area' role that Nato
cannot agree on for itself.
Last weekend, Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, was urging his
EC colleagues to think of setting up a permanent planning cell in the WEU,
even in peacetime. However, Mr Roland Dumas, his French counterpart,
dismissed all talk of such mechanisms in the WEU as secondary to the great
question of principle: whether Europe had the political will for common
defence.
France, in fact, has gone very silent on the WEU over which it currently
presides. It used its six-month presidency to convene a special 15-minute
meeting of the organisation in the margins of the EC summit on April 8,
ostensibly to give the WEU the task of co-ordinating aid to the Kurds but
mainly to show how it could have life inside the EC womb.
In fact, the WEU role in aid co-ordination has been virtually nil. By
contrast, France has, albeit belatedly, joined in the strategic review in
Nato.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Delayed launch for missile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW air-to-surface nuclear missile which the US wants to deploy in Europe
and is also a prime contender for a British contract is not now expected to
be ready for service before 1998, three years later than planned.
The setback to plans for the SRAM-T, a tactical nuclear derivative of
Boeing's short-range attack missile, emerged in recent evidence by the US
Air Force to a sub-committee of the House of Representatives' Armed Services
Committee.
Plans for new tactical air-to-surface missiles are crucial to Nato's
commitment to maintaining European-based nuclear forces, since all its
remaining ground-launched nuclear weapons in Europe are due to be withdrawn
or negotiated away.
The SRAM-T project has been dogged by technical problems and the reluctance
of European Nato governments to say publicly they will host the new US
weapons.
Mr Dan Plesch of the British-American Security Information Council, a
research group opposed to Nato nuclear weapon plans, said the project's
predicament would put pressure on the UK government to state clearly its
readiness to have the missiles de ployed at US bases in Britain.
The UK has meanwhile put off deciding whether to buy from the US or join a
French project in order to provide a similar nuclear capability for the RAF.
The latter's current free-fall nuclear bombs will be obsolete by the
decade's end.
The British Defence Ministry has been considering the SRAM-T as well as a
version of Martin Marietta's Supersonic Low Altitude Target (Slat) missile
and the French Air-Sol Longue Portee (ASLP) project. Officials now argue
that the missile decision can wait while a UK warhead is developed.

<TEXT>
GENEROUS extra payments to west German beamte (public officials) to persuade
them to work in east Germany have been criticised as 'grotesque' by Mr
Heinrich Weiss, head of the BDI employers' organisation.
His unusually outspoken attack on 'interest group selfishness' comes a few
weeks after the Bonn government decided to offer the beamte a tax-free
monthly income top-up of up to DM2,500 (Pounds 836) as part of the new
emphasis on establishing an efficient administration in east Germany.
This incentive was offered despite the fact that beamte are meant to be
prepared to serve wherever the state decides. Mr Weiss points out in a
newspaper interview published today that they already enjoy special job
security and pension benefits to compensate for the uncertainty created by
that duty to the state.
The west German beamte are often described as arrogant and insensitive by
the east German public officials with whom they work and the extra payments
may well have increased resentment.
West German companies which have acquired east German subsidiaries are also
usually paying incentives to managers to go east, but these tend to be
proportionately lower than the beamte incentive.
The Treuhand privatisation agency continues to have great difficulty
attracting west German managers to help manage the east German companies
which cannot be privatised.
However, it emerged yesterday that Mr Lothar Spath, former premier of
Baden-Wurttemberg, will probably take over as chairman of the prestigious
east German Carl Zeiss Jena group, now owned by the Thuringian government.

THE SWIFT moves towards German unity very nearly provoked Soviet military
intervention last spring, according to Mr Lothar de Maiziere, former leader
of the democratic East German government elected in March 1990.
In an interview with east Germany's new tabloid Super, which is part-owned
by Mr Rupert Murdoch, the former premier said that while on a visit to
Moscow last spring he had sensed the tension and heard that 'there were
several marshals who still wanted to drive their tanks up to the Brandenburg
Gate to stop the unity process'.
On his return, said Mr de Maiziere, he told Chancellor Helmut Kohl that he
thought there were only three months, at most four, before the window to
unity would close.
The Christian Democrat leadership, to which Mr de Maiziere briefly belonged,
has always maintained that the uncomfortable speed at which unity was
completed was necessary for foreign policy reasons.
Mr de Maiziere also said that he thought the Soviet Union would not have
agreed to unity today.

<TEXT>
THE Armenian government has accused the Soviet authorities of promoting a
'war' between it and neighbouring Azerbaijan after 36 people were reported
killed in an attack on an Armenian-populated village in Azerbaijan.
The attack by Soviet and Azerbaijani interior troops on the village of
Getashen in the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan also left hundreds wounded,
according to Armenian government officials.
The village, with a population of 3,000, is close to the Armenian-populated
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan, which Armenia has demanded should
come under its control. The dispute has cost more than 200 lives in the past
three years.
Fighting has also been reported along the Armenian/Azerbaijani border in the
southern Caucasus, from the Noyemberyansky district in the north to the
Gorisky district in the south.
Fighting is now going on in or between all three of the Soviet Caucasian
republics. In Georgia, clashes between Georgian and Ossetians in South
Ossetia are said to be increasing. The murderous ethnic feuds are fuelling
demands by hardliners for President Mikhail Gorbachev to declare a state of
emergency.
'In mountainous Karabakh, in the Shahumian region, in the Getashen district,
and on the Azerbaijan-Armenia border there now exists a state of war,' the
Armenian parliament statement said.
Communist officials were ejected from the Armenian Communist party central
committee building in Yerevan yesterday, according to the official news
agency Tass.
This followed a decision last month by the Armenian supreme soviet to
nationalise party property.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Some cars 50% dearer in Britain says MMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME pre-tax car prices charged in the UK are more than 50 per cent higher
than those in certain other European markets, according to a confidential
study prepared for the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The commission, which is investigating claims that car makers charge
excessive prices in the UK, has provisionally concluded that at least two
so-called 'complex monopolies' exist in the supply of new cars, which
'prevent, restrict or distort' competition in the UK.
These are:
The 'gentlemen's agreement' between the British and Japanese motor
industries which in effect has restricted imports of Japanese cars into the
UK to less than 11 per cent of the market, and;
Car makers' selective distribution systems.
The MMC has written to 46 UK car makers and importers outlining its
provisional conclusions and detailing the supporting evidence it has
gathered in the last 12 months.
The industry will have a last chance in coming weeks to respond to these
findings and influence the final report, which is to be presented to Mr
Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, by early August. The MMC has
still to decide whether the 'complex monopolies' it has identified operate
against the public interest and whether the government should take action
but its provisional findings are likely to meet fierce opposition from the
motor industry.
The line of attack taken by the inquiry threatens to undermine
long-entrenched restrictive car pricing and distribution practices in the UK
and could lead to a revolution in the 1990s in the way cars are retailed.
The present restriction on Japanese car imports to the UK is already
expected to be abandoned at the end of 1992 as a result of the creation of
the European single market.
The controversial pricing study prepared for the commission by Ludvigsen
Associates, the UK-based automotive consultants, quotes, as one example, the
October 1990 pre-tax prices, adjusted for differing equipment levels, for a
1.1 litre Ford Fiesta.
The prices range from Pounds 5,828 in the UK to Pounds 5,451 in Ireland,
Pounds 4,359 in Germany, Pounds 4,311 in France, Pounds 4,057 in Belgium and
Pounds 3,788 in the Netherlands. The British price is nearly 54 per cent
higher than the equivalent Dutch price.
Another example, on the same basis, shows the price of a BMW 318i varying
from Pounds 9,086 in France to Pounds 9,960 in Belgium, Pounds 10,027 in the
Netherlands, Pounds 10,053 in Germany, Pounds 10,547 in the UK and Pounds
12,673 in Ireland.
The study compares car prices in six European markets and seeks to make
comparisons between pre-tax prices, as well as between post-tax on-the-road
prices.
The scale of price discrepancies found by the study varies considerably from
model to model and from car maker to car maker.
Car producers and importers in the UK are expected to contest vigorously the
study's findings. The industry has claimed that previous studies, such as
those made by European consumer organisations, have failed fully to take
account of key factors that distort prices across Europe, such as varying
car tax rates, differing model specifications, exchange rate movements and
discount levels.
Pricing is a highly sensitive issue for the car makers, which are currently
facing two investigations, the MMC's study and a parallel inquiry by the
European Commission.
The two investigations are expected to play a vital role in the European
Commission's review of the present 'block exemption', which allows car
makers to employ selective distribution systems in Europe contrary to EC
competition regulations.
The 10-year block exemption, granted until 1995, is conditional on pre-tax
car prices not varying between EC member states by more than 12 per cent in
the long term or by more than 18 per cent for periods of less than a year.
The MMC claims that the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the
Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association the UK and Japanese motor
industry trade associations, constitute a 'complex monopoly' which limits
competition.
The MMC letter says that discussions between the two trade associations have
taken place regularly since 1975 and have consistently led to imports of new
Japanese cars into the UK being limited to 'a specific share by volume of
the forecast total UK supply'.
Under the selective distribution 'complex monopoly' it questions a series of
car makers' existing practices. These include:
The granting of exclusive sales territories.
Limits placed on the number and locations of dealerships allowed to
individual car retailer groups.
Prohibitions on selling competing makes at the same site.
Refusing to supply new cars for resale except through the supplier's
franchised dealer system.
Offering in the UK only part of the car range available in other parts of
the EC.
Offering specified classes of customers discriminatory discounts unrelated
to cost.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Shell and BP find big oil field off Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHELL OIL, the US arm of the multinational Royal Dutch/Shell group,
announced an important oil discovery yesterday in the Gulf of Mexico which
could contain as much as 1bn barrels of oil.
The discovery is the biggest in the US for 20 years, opening up the
potential of the Gulf region which the industry believes could be another
North Sea.
The Mars discovery, at a depth of 3,100 feet, makes it one of the deepest
commercially-viable oilfields. The only other field of this depth under
development is Shell's Auger operation nearby.
British Petroleum, which has a one-third interest in the Mars field, said it
was 'potentially the biggest prospect in which the company has participated
since the discovery of its major North Sea fields'.
Shell said further engineering studies were required before it could
estimate the full size of the find, but industry observers believe it to
rank among the world's 'giant' finds which contain 1bn barrels of oil or
more.
The largest oilfield in the UK sector of the North Sea is the Forties field
which is estimated to contain 2.5bn barrels.
Oil could be produced from the Mars discovery within five years of starting
development, the company said yesterday.
Mr John Browne, head of exploration at BP, said the find 'obviously has
great significance for the industry because it is the first time an operator
has announced a discovery at these depths'.
The depth of the Gulf of Mexico - North Sea fields are 600 to 700 feet deep
 -makes it more complicated and expensive to develop, requiring the latest
oilfield technology.
One industry expert estimates that costs could be double those of the North
Sea where it takes about Dollars 3.40 to produce a barrel of oil.
Oil revenue taxes in the US are much lower than in the UK, however, and the
discoveries will be more profitable.
The development of deep-sea technology to exploit these oil finds has
implications for the area of the North Sea, west of Shetland, where
exploration could begin in several years.

FT  02 MAY 91 / MPs call on trust hospitals to reveal business plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ALL-PARTY Commons health committee yesterday entered the controversy
over the government's health service reforms with a decision to ask managers
of the Guy's and Bradford trust hospitals to produce financial information
which the government has refused to publish.
The move came as the British Medical Association called for an urgent
meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister, to raise concerns about the
'continued underfunding' of the National Health Service.
Both steps will sustain the political controversy which has raged for nearly
a week since Guy's Hospital, London, and the Bradford Hospitals Trust
announced up to 1,000 job cuts within a month of the health reforms taking
effect.
Opposition parties have sought to exploit the issue and hope the rekindling
of concern over the health reforms will work to their advantage in today's
local government elections.
The Commons health committee decided in a private session to begin an
investigation later this month into NHS trusts, which are managed outside
direct health authority control. Mr William Waldegrave, the health
secretary, Mr Peter Griffiths, general manager of Guy's, and managers from
Bradford will be among those asked to give evidence.
The committee will call on the trusts to produce the application documents
and business plans on which the government reached its decision to grant
them self-governing status. Members want as much information as other
parliamentary committees have when investigating nationalised industries.
Ministers have maintained that the information was for internal working
purposes and never intended or prepared for publication. This position was
defended at a public meeting of the health committee yesterday by both Sir
Christopher France, permanent secretary at the department of health, and Mr
Duncan Nichol, NHS chief executive.
All organisations, said Sir Christopher, needed to produce internal
documents and he rejected the description of the documents as secret. This
suggested that 'everybody goes into a corner and sorts things out in a
huddle, and does so for nefarious reasons.' This was not the case with the
trust hospital plans.
Mr Nichol, who told the committee that he did not know in advance of the 600
jobs losses planned at Guy's said that publication of the business plans
could affect the effectiveness of the internal market on which the health
reforms are based.
The BMA council yesterday adopted a resolution rejecting Mr Major's view
that the NHS's problems were merely organisational ones, declaring that
'continued underfunding and the effects of the NHS reforms are the principle
cause of the deteriorating service and deteriorating morale'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RED SQUARE, traditionally a sea of red banners and rallies on May Day, saw
an extraordinarily low-key version of the workers' annual celebration.
Yesterday's proceedings were devoid of long speeches and were over in record
time, confirming the break-up of Communist supremacy.
Key Politburo members, such as Mr Vladimir Kryuchkov, KGB chief and Mr Boris
Pugo, interior minister, remained at the foot of Lenin's mausoleum, leaving
only President Mikhail Gorbachev on top with trade union speakers.
The leadership line-up on the mausoleum used to be scanned by
Kremlinologists for signs of any shift in the balance of power. Last year,
as political opposition began to flourish, Mr Gorbachev abruptly left the
podium after being booed.
The only link with the past yesterday was the mass of security men who kept
spectators from the mausoleum.
The march through Red Square, involving a few thousand well-dressed workers
and a brass band, was organised by Communist-controlled trade unions instead
of by the party.
Gone were complacent banners proclaiming the party's greatness. Instead the
marchers sought to convey to Mr Gorbachev their recipes for economic reform
(or hyperinflation) and their discontent over recent price rises.
The most ferocious party stalwarts to be seen came embarrassingly from its
loony fringe. A few hundred people carrying portraits of Josef Stalin called
for a people's court to try the country's leaders and condemned the idea of
market reforms.
'No to privatisation. The Counter-Revolution will not succeed,' said one
banner. Another called for the country's leading economists, such as
Professor Stanislav Shatalin to be put on trial for allegedly obeying the
'diktat' of the International Monetary Fund.
In Leningrad, the most eye-catching feature was a march by conservative
nationalists who displayed anti-Semitic banners. One banner accused
President Gorbachev and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader, of being
frontmen for international Jewish capital and said they should be tried for
treason. Another suggested that Mr Yeltsin should run for president of
Israel.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (36): The potential to be one of Europe's
crowd-pullers - Poland is trying to put itself back on the tourist map
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S previous image as a rather forbidding iron-curtain country of food
queues and secret police made it seem an unlikely choice for tourists. Now
it is making determined efforts to put itself back on the mainstream tourist
map of Europe.
Tourism has already blossomed in Poland in the wake of the political
changes. In 1988 and 1989 the number of visitors from eastern European
countries was steady at around 6.5m. In 1990 this mushroomed to 15.8m.
Visitors from East Germany, now with D-marks to spend, went up from 1.2m in
1989 to more than 9m in 1990, while those from the Soviet Union rose from
2.9m to 4.3m. In reality most were not 'tourists' in the traditional sense,
but small traders.
In the same period the number of visitors from Romania increased from 19,000
to 395,000. Most of these were not tourists, but refugees. Many of them,
sadly, are now to be found begging on the streets of Poland.
The number of visitors from western countries also rose from 1.6m in 1989 to
2.3m in 1990, with many people curious to see for themselves the changes
that were taking place.
Alongside the more well-known attractions - the historic cities such as
Krakow, Poznan and Gdansk, and the old town in Warsaw - Poland is
surprisingly rich in natural assets.
There are the Baltic beaches, heavily polluted in parts, but already a
playground for Germans and Scandinavians - and the Mazurian and Pomeranian
lakes, a belt of hundreds of unspoilt lakes and rolling hills and forest
across northern Poland.
To the east, on the Soviet border, lies the Bialowieska forest, one of the
last areas of primeval forest in Europe, and home to European bison, wild
horses, beaver and lynx. In the south, for walkers and skiers there are the
Sudeten, Carpathian and Tatra mountains.
The natural potential is there, but in many places hotel facilities are poor
or non-existent. That looks set to change.
Orbis, the state travel agency under the communist regime, underwent the
first stage of re-privatisation this year (it was originally founded as a
private company in Lvov, now in the Ukraine, 71 years ago). This gave it
independence from any ministry, and made it the official owner - rather than
just the manager - of its 54 hotels. This makes it possible for western
investors to enter into a joint venture with any Orbis hotel.
Although Orbis has a small number of western-standard hotels, built by
leading companies such as Holiday Inn, Novotel and Intercontinental, and run
on a franchise basis, many of its other hotels are badly in need of a refit.
Orbis's first priority, according to its new president, Mr Jerzy Sulowski,
will be to refurbish and extend its existing three- and four-star hotels, at
an estimated cost of Dollars 400m.
'Three-quarters of our hotels don't meet their star rating,' Mr Sulowski
admits, adding that Orbis is already negotiating with potential partners.
These hotels will still cater mainly for business travellers, but Orbis's
second priority is to build a chain of two-star hotels, many outside the
main cities, for families and mass tourism.
Orbis also operates a chain of 170 travel agencies at home with more than
1,000 branches abroad specialising in arranging travel to Poland. But here,
as in other service areas, there is rapid growth in private travel agencies
providing the kind of service, speed and flexibility which the old state
monolith conspicuously lacked.
'As far as tourism in Poland goes, we are not afraid of any competition,' Mr
Sulowski declares, although he admits that the agencies suffer from
'technical backwardness'. Communications are hampered by Poland's
notoriously inefficient telephone network, and investment is badly needed in
information technology.
Orbis is also attempting to join one of the computerised European
reservation networks.
Despite Orbis's experience of co-operation with international hotel chains,
its somewhat jaded image means that western operators may choose to go it
alone until they are convinced about the extent of Orbis's internal
perestroika.
Warsaw's Marriott Hotel has a house rule that previous employment at Orbis
disqualifies applicants for jobs at the glittering tower block which vies
for attention with Stalin's gothic Palace of Culture on the Warsaw skyline.
Trusthouse Forte is already at work restoring Warsaw's ornate Bristol Hotel
to its pre-communist glory, and foreign companies, including IAEG, Hyatt,
Conrad, Pullman, Warimpex and Accor, are all interested in constructing
hotels in Poland, according to Mr Stefan Jerzak, vice-president of the
newly-founded Commercial Bank of Tourism.
The bank could be an important element in the industry's growth. A joint
stock company founded at the end of 1990 by the state treasury, Orbis, and
two other tourist organisations, Gromada and PTTK, the bank also took over
the funds - and, broadly, the functions - of the state's 30-year-old Central
Fund for Tourism and Recreation.
The bank began operating in March, with capital of Dollars 11.2m, and has
already started granting credits to tourist companies. Although Polish law
says that banks should be open to all customers, its name leaves little
doubt about its proposed market.
'The bank aims to be the main source of investment in tourism and tourist
facilities,' Mr Jerzak says.
At home, it will co-operate with the Polish Hotels Association, providing
capital for rebuilding and for staff training.
The bank will also take over foreign exchange dealing in Orbis's travel
agencies and hotels, under licence, giving it more than 230 exchange
counters throughout Poland. It will be investing in a satellite
communications network to speed up accounting, and the processing of credit
card bills, which at present can take several weeks. In the long term, the
bank hopes to introduce its own credit card.
From abroad, Swiss, German and US investors have all shown interest in
constructing small hotels, and in converting some of Poland's many small
castles, particularly in the lakes regions. In a few years' time, Poland
could be one of Europe's crowd-pullers.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (35): Favourite son returns - Polish Pope's
third visit next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POPE JOHN Paul II, Poland's most famous son, returns to his homeland for the
fourth papal visit next month. It will be his first visit to the new
post-communist, sovereign Poland which he did so much behind the scenes to
foster.
Nobody will forget the Polish pope's first triumphant return to his native
land in 1979. Millions turned out to greet him in a spontaneous outburst of
national pride and religious fervour, which definitively settled Stalin's
famous question, 'How many divisions has the Pope?'
A year later, Solidarity erupted from the same well-spring of revived
national energy, led by an alliance of catholic workers and catholic
intellectuals, whose faith and determination contrasted with and shamed the
bankrupt communistestablishment.
His two subsequent visits in 1983 and 1987 were altogether more sombre
affairs in the Poland of martial law. But both his presence and his close
following of Polish events helped keep alive the sense that one day Poland
would again be free.
The church, traditional repository of Poland's historical continuity and
culture, thrived in opposition to atheistic Marxism, and grew strong in
adversity. But the Poland the Pope returns to next month is a country in the
throes of transition to a market economy, multi-party democracy and a
'normal' (that is to say, western) consumer society. It is fast becoming a
'normal' society warts and all, including sex shops, openly displayed
pornography and many of the grosser forms of nouveaux riches exhibitionism -
liberating and enjoyable to some, sinful to traditional believers.
He will, of course, be welcomed. But it is unlikely to be the same as
before. Under communism, there was a clear distinction between church and
state. But in the new Poland the church is jockeying for power and influence
in ways which more secular Poles find increasingly irksome.
Successful church pressure to introduce religious instruction in schools,
and above all its campaign to change the country's liberal abortion laws,
are all controversial issues on views. So, however, do defenders of civil
rights, such as veteran dissident and former labour minister Jacek Kuron,
who is prepared to push for a national referendum on the abortion question.
Such issues threaten to embroil the Pope in the domestic political scene,
only months before elections in October, from which the church hopes to see
emerge a strong Christian democrat-type party at the heart of Polish
politics.
At a time when many Poles face the previously unknown perils of unemployment
and further economic hardship, his words will also be carefully weighed for
any direct or implied criticism of the government's present commitment to
the speediest possible transition to a market economy.
The liberal free-marketeers, currently in charge, reject the old distorted
communist welfare-state mentality. But to many, the old social safety-net
sits easier with traditional Christian charity than policies which
inevitably favour the fleet of foot at the expense of the lame.
The Pope's travels will take him through rural Poland, where the church is
strongest, and close to the eastern frontier. Thousands of catholics from
the Baltic states, Byelorussia and the Ukraine are expected to flock over
the borders to hear their spiritual leader. The church has its ost-politik,
too, and is busy restoring ties and rebuilding congregations in lands which
not long ago were part of Poland.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (33): Life uncushioned - Industry's
problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROAD SWATHES of Polish industry are now being squeezed between the hard
place of an appreciating currency and the rock of European Community import
restrictions, and the collapse of the Comecon market.
What is more, privatisation has hardly scratched the surface of Poland's
largely obsolete industrial enterprises, and the factors which allowed many
to survive bankruptcy are fast running out.
There is little question that much industry will either disappear or be
radically revamped in the coming months. The most vulnerable are those
concerns that relied heavily on the Soviet Union for cheap energy and raw
material inputs, and on Soviet and East German markets.
At least 200 large factories were dependent on Comecon markets for over 35
per cent of their business. Many in the engineering, electronics and
consumer-goods industries - producing goods as diverse as helicopters, light
aircraft, grain-dryers, machine tools and industrial plant of various kinds
 -have little chance of finding alternative outlets.
At the same time, the sharp decline in domestic consumption and investment
demand, and increasing competition from imported consumer goods (thanks to
virtual abolition of import tariffs and appreciation of the zloty over the
last 16 months) have also pushed many large enterprises close to bankruptcy.
The Star truck plant, employing 12,000 people, is but one example.
This is precisely what the government wants. The harsh truth, told by
finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz, is that too many inefficient
monopolistic enterprises have been able to keep going by extending
inter-factory credits, running down stocks bought at former
artificially-cheap prices, shedding labour and taking advantage of the
former artificially-low exchange rate to export, even when, as in the Soviet
case, the purchaser cannot or will not pay.
Most of these cushions no longer exist, and the coming months should see a
remorseless weeding out of an industrial structure which, by western
standards, is grossly deformed, with too many large, energy-inefficient and
labour-intensive industries and too few service, high-technology and
consumer industries.
A recent study by Professors Jeffrey Sachs and David Lipton showed that the
average Polish state-owned industrial enterprise employed 378 people,
against 80 in a sample of western economies; while no less than 58 per cent
of all such enterprises employed over 1,000 people, against 19 per cent in
the west. Nearly 20 per cent of all Polish workers were employed in
enterprises employing over 5,000 workers.
What this means, in effect, is that many small towns in Poland are virtually
company towns, with one or two enterprises acting as the source not only of
employment but of all social services, from housing to health and welfare.
The social and political consequences of closure are magnified, especially
as the severe national housing shortage makes labour mobility difficult.
In spite of the difficulties, the present government is adamant that many
such enterprises will have to be privatised, restructured or closed, and
their assets sold - hopefully, to budding entrepreneurs who can better use
of them. If not, it is setting up labour exchanges, job re-training schemes
and making the recently introduced unemployment pay system more selective,
to concentrate on the worst problem areas.
Despite the problems, some Polish enterprises appear to be adapting well to
difficult circumstances. The Polar domestic appliances company outside
Wroclaw, for example, has found that its former east German competitors are
no longer in the market. It raised exports to the west by 30 per cent last
year, and intends to keep up the pace, even though at current exchange rates
exports are only barely profitable.
In Lodz, home of a depressed textile industry, the recently privatised
Prochnik enterprise needs 200 extra workers to manufacture garments for the
German market, using imported German fabrics. It can't find them, despite an
official 60,000 unemployment level in the town. Textile manufacturer
RenaKord, a few kilometres away, relies less on cheap labour, and is
squeezed by the high price of imported raw materials, EC quotas and US
tariffs. Its ancient factories include many recently imported German
machines, and it is negotiating with a potential US partner.
Up to now, however, Poland has not been very successful in attracting
foreign capital for the vital task of industrial re-generation; though the
hope is that, with debt re-scheduling agreed and new investment laws and
financial institutions, this picture will change.
Foreign companies that have taken the plunge and bet on Poland's long-term
economic prospects include Asea Brown Boveri, which is modernising the power
generating-equipment industry, and Philips, which has taken 51 per cent of
Polam, the largest light-bulb company; while Fiat and General Motors have
proferred competing plans for large-scale investment in modernising the
motor industry.
Despite its current difficulties, Poland has a very cheap and relatively
well educated workforce, proximity to EC markets and, above all, its own
domestic market of nearly 40m hitherto frustrated consumers. It is well
placed to absorb the large-scale investment, which is needed not only to
bring its industry up to international levels but also to improve the rail,
road, telecommunications and other infrastructures.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (34): Catching up with information - Review
of changes in control of the media

ALL Poland's newspapers were once owned by RSW Prasa, one of Europe's
largest publishing concerns. Their profits went to RSW's owner - the
Communist Party.
Newspapers, as well as radio and TV, were run by the Communist Party's press
department and the system was as simple as one-party rule itself.
Dismantling it has been a more complex business.
Disposing of RSW's assets has been the responsibility of a seven-man
liquidating committee set up by an Act of parliament last year. In its
heyday the concern employed 85,000 people, owned 22,500 newspaper kiosks and
25 printing works and brought out 160 newspapers and journals.
Breaking up this empire has been a controversial process with political,
financial and even foreign policy considerations all being brought into play
as editors and journalists, as well as hopeful owners and politicians, have
fought for control of the papers.
Mr Maciej Ilowiecki, the head of the SDP, a journalists' association, is
highly critical of the way the sales have been conducted. He argues that the
reasons for decisions have not been explained to the public. He is also
concerned that Poles often knew too little about potential foreign buyers
and their real intentions.
New political parties such as the Christian Democrat Centre Agreement have
schemed to win control of organs like the Express Wieczorny, the Warsaw
working man's favoured evening reading. The politicians primarily wanted
influence. But last year also showed that with the growth of revenues from
advertising newspapers have become profitable.
Mr Robert Hersant, the right-wing French publisher of Le Figaro, has emerged
as the most significant foreign buyer. He has taken substantial shares in
six newspapers, including Rzeczpospolita, once the government's own
newspaper.
He has also bought titles in key local centres such as Gdansk and Lodz and
intends to bid for dailies in Katowice, the country's largest industrial
area.
expensive. The Dziennik Baltycki in Gdansk, which showed a profit last year
of 4bn zlotys (USDollars 430,000), cost Mr Hersant 12bn zlotys. In this case
the group has a 51 per cent share. The balance is owned by Solidarity's
Gdansk region, a politically powerful if impecunious partner.
Mr Hersant's right-wing views have stood him in good stead on his shopping
spree in Poland's present political climate, and a measure of French
influence has been seen as a good thing in the light of residual fears of
Germany.
Mr Robert Maxwell, the British publisher, has had less luck. He has suffered
from his previous connections with high-ranking East European communists,
whose biographies he published in his World Leaders series.
He failed to buy a share in Zycie Warszawy, a leading Warsaw daily, which
was sold recently for 40bn zlotys after an epic political battle. The
successful bidder was Mr Kazimierz Woycicki, the present editor, who amassed
an impressive array of letters of support from President Walesa downwards.
Much of the finance came from STEI, a small media group from Sardinia.
The RSW sale is now almost over and when it ends some 102 journals will have
been sold and another 61 handed over to co-operatives formed by the
journalists themselves.
But as the dust settles another even more intense competition is about to
start as franchises are awarded for private radio and TV broadcasts.
Literally hundeds of applications have been sent to the ministry of
communications, and more are expected before the June 10 closing date.
The flow started ahead of draft legislation de-monopolising the broadcast
media which is on its way through parliament. It will vest decisions on the
granting of broadcast rights in a special committee - part appointed by
parliament and part by the president.
Foreign participation in any company wishing to broadcast in Poland is
limited to 33 per cent. But private channels wanting to compete with state
TV will need foreign financing. RTL of Luxembourg, as well as Silvio
Berlusconi's Fininvest group of Italy, have demonstrated interest.
'Foreign visitors tend now to be showing an interest in tall buildings,'
says Mr Andrzej Jonas, editor of the English language Warsaw Voice weekly.
They are looking for places to put their broadcasting equipment.
One domestic group bidding for a licence is Independent Polish TV (NTP),
which groups Polish companies ranging from publishers to film studios and it
estimates it will need Dollars 60m in its first year.
While newspaper readership has held up surprisingly well, given rising costs
and the collapse of the distribution network in the smaller towns and the
countryside, it is TV and radio which is literally providing access to every
household.
A recent survey done by OBOP, state radio and TV's research centre, shows
that 100 per cent of the population have access to a TV set, with 63 per
cent watching in colour. Around 97 per cent have access to a radio.
Meanwhile, 10 per cent of the population have access to satellite TV
programmes (often thanks to small local cable networks) a figure which has
grown from 1 per cent a year ago. Futhermore, 28 per cent of all households
have access to video recorders, more than double last year's figure.
Mr David Chase, a rich financier from the US, has embarked on an ambitious
venture to install cable TV throughout the country. He plans to invest up to
Dollars 1bn and once the project is under way is counting on an annual
revenue of around Dollars 340m. In the information sphere at least Poland is
catching up fast.

the evolution of the movement and discuss the future of trade unions

<TEXT>
ZBIGNIEW BUJAK was an almost legendary figure in the 1980s as the
clandestine leader of the Solidarity underground in Warsaw during martial
law. On one celebrated occasion he wore a long, blond wig for a clandestine
TV interview to demonstrate the range of disguises which kept the secret
police always one step behind.
Like many other colleagues now in positions of authority, he has failed to
reap the rewards of the risks he took then. Indeed, he has found himself
once more at the beginning of his political road, as he seeks to build a
social democratic alternative to the government's policies.
'I am quite alone,' he says, sitting in a sparsely furnished office a floor
above the Stefan Batory Trust, a foundation set up by Mr George Soros, the
rich American-Hungarian financier, which Mr Bujak chaired until recently.
Mr Bujak, now in his mid-30s, first became involved in politics as a young
worker at the Ursus tractor factory in the late 1970s. He had links with the
dissident KOR movement set up by Adam Michnik, Jacek Kuron and others to
defend workers' rights during the repression which followed the 1976 worker
protests. When the Solidarity trade union suddenly burst upon the scene in
1980, he was elected its leader in Warsaw.
After martial law, he was one of the movement's national leaders until his
arrest in 1986. Then he espoused free-market views, and when the Solidarity
movement re-emerged in 1989 he wanted the trade union to do little more than
smooth the way to a purely entrepreneurial society.
'I was a liberal at the beginning, and I believed that this would be enough
to improve the situation of the companies and thus the employees,' he says.
He saw Solidarity as acting as a giant labour exchange, helping industry to
restructure and to defuse the discontent provoked by the economic costs of
transition.
He did not go into parliament but supported the previous Mazowiecki
government, adopting a fiercely anti-Walesa stance during last autumn's
presidential election.
Yet even before the election, he felt that the government was not doing
enough to support the formation of Polish capital, and that this was
contributing to the growth of fears about foreign capital.
But it was during the presidential campaign that Mr Bujak noticed the growth
of opposition to economic change. 'The situation of the workers and the
farmers wasn't improving, and this marks a threat for the whole programme,'
he says.
During the election he also noticed that he had lost contact with the shop
floor. 'My people at Ursus told me that, by supporting the Balcerowicz plan
(the Government's IMF-approved anti-inflation programme), I had betrayed
them.' He realised also that people were beginning to fear the privatisation
programme. Now, he argues that something must be done to help state-sector
companies to perform better and leave privatisation for later.
He explains his search for social democratic solutions as a way of trying to
rebuild support for the economic reforms before they are, in his view,
rejected altogether.
'Poland needs a programme which stands a chance of winning popular support
and that explains the social democrat option,' he says, adding that his
ultimate aim is still to rebuild a market economy.
He sees the left-wing parliamentary post-Solidarity 'Solidarnosc Pracy'
group, led by Mr Richard Bugaj, as a potential ally, as well as the
moderates in the small Polish Socialist party (PPS) led by Mr Jan Jozef
Lipski, another KOR veteran. He admits lack of funds means that these groups
have little influence at the moment.
But he is no longer afraid that his views mean he will be criticised for
being crypto-communist. He thinks that communism's negative connotations are
beginning to fade and believes it is no longer politically dangerous to be
considered left of centre. He even predicts that the SdRP, the
post-communist party, will get a 15 per cent share of the vote in the autumn
parliamentary election.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (31): Guardian of the reforms - What has
happened to Solidarity?  FT writers trace the evolution of the movement and

<TEXT>
SOLIDARITY, the alliance of workers and intellectuals that was born in
Gdansk's Lenin shipyard in 1980 and helped to oust communism across eastern
Europe, has been forced to re-examine its role in the new democratic Poland.
It has decided to return to its roots as a trade union.
The election of computer scientist Marian Krzaklewski as Solidarity's new
chairman, at its February congress, was seen as an endorsement of that move.
Mr Krzaklewski said in his speech to the congress: 'I am convinced that the
union chairman should remain outside political arrangements and pressures by
various political centres.'
The resignation of Lech Walesa, so long the symbol of Solidarity, to take up
the post of president of Poland, was a turning point for the union. Mr
Slawomir Rogucki, secretary of Solidarity's newly-created presidium, admits
the union finds itself in a contradictory position.
'On the one hand, it has to be a union, and its charter says it has to
defend the workers. On the other, Solidarity is still responsible for the
fate of the reforms started two years ago,' he says.
'It's difficult to reconcile these two different roles, especially in a
situation where the quality of life of many workers has fallen.'
This can bring the union into conflict with the government. Solidarity is,
for example, pressing for the abolition of the punitive tax on excessive
wage increases - which has resulted in workers' wages falling in real terms
 -in the second half of this year, with enterprises allowed to link
tax-exempt wage increases with higher productivity.
The wage tax is a pillar of the finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz's
anti-inflation policy, the backbone of his whole economic programme.
As many people have suffered under the Balcerowicz plan, the pro-communist
trade union OPZZ and what Mr Rogucki describes as the 'post-communist
forces' still enjoy support in Poland. 'They use populist slogans,' Mr
Rogucki says. 'They don't feel responsible for the state of the country.'
In the light of this threat, Solidarity feels it cannot relinquish its role
as guardian of the reforms until Poland has reached full parliamentary
democracy.
'We started this process, we have to finish it. But we don't wish to usurp
the right of the government to rule. We don't wish to dominate. Solidarity
must point out the mistakes of the government,' Mr Rogucki says.
The difficulty is finding the balance, and not hindering the growth of
opposition parties. Mr Rogucki points out that in a state conditioned to
one-party rule, there is a danger that Solidarity might come to be regarded
automatically as the sole power.
Despite arguments from some delegates that Solidarity should take full
responsibility for the reform process in Poland, and field candidates for
all seats in the parliament, the union eventually voted to participate in
the elections later this year, but not field enough candidates to risk
winning an overall majority.
It will, however, support the political parties that have grown out of it.
Mr Rogucki sees Solidarity remaining as a single, united movement, rather
than splitting into separate unions representing different trades and
professions, although it is to be restructured. Fifteen different trade
secretariats, with secretaries belonging to a national executive committee,
will replace the current structure of 100-plus regional organisations.

THE WORKERS, mobilised into the Solidarity movement, brought down Poland's
so-called 'workers state'. Yet, as the country reverts to capitalist free
markets and unemployment threatens to exceed 2m, the future of the trade
union movement is in dispute.
Both Solidarity and the communist-created OPZZ union federation, set up
during martial law to counter its influence, are, for differing reasons
suffering an identity crisis, and it could be some time before new unions
emerge.
Ironies abound. Solidarity, in its heyday in 1981 was a worldwide symbol of
free trade unionism. Now it is wracked by its dual role as it seeks to
defend the immediate interests of its 2.5m members and support the
Government's austerity policies.
The OPZZ had similar problems in the past. Under the Communists it made
militant gestures but was bound in the end by its party affiliation to
support the government.
Now the OPZZ is in opposition and could face the confiscation of its
property, as once happened to Solidarity, should the next parliament have a
strongly right wing hue.
The OPZZ has 5m members on the books, but only a fifth pay dues, and its
credibility is low, even though its expertise on bread and butter issues is
better than Solidarity's. Opinion polls show that its leader, Mr Alfred
Miodowicz, a former Communist Politburo member, enjoys little popular
confidence. In the factories Solidarity, although sometimes smaller is often
more effective.
Both movements want to play a more overt political role trade unions,
putting up candidates at the next elections and hoping to put together
coalitions to defend their interests.
Solidarity is now headed by Mr Marian Krzaklewski,a scientific researcher
from Silesia. He replaced Mr Lech Walesa at February's Solidarity congress
and is wary of his union allowing itself to be used by the fledgling
political parties now seeking his support.
Solidarity is suffering from a severe bout of schizophrenia. Its activists
feel responsible for the success of the economic reforms which they
initiated but which are now causing discomfort to their members as real
incomes fall.
On the other hand, the 20,000 or so full-time Solidarity officials at the
national and factory level feel they are the new establishment and are
becoming accustomed to giving orders.
'Remember, lady, this is Solidarity calling' an irate shop steward told a
minister's secretary when she informed him he could not be put through on
the telephone. But 'sometimes they know they have to threaten strike action
because the members want something done, but they're loathe to do it because
they see strikes as being aimed at themselves,' an official in Gdansk says
of his colleagues.
Strikes are not popular. Fear of unemployment and the precarious situation
of state sector companies mean that on the whole people do not see the
point. Instead Solidarity has had to rely on influencing the Government
through private channels while the OPZZ has organised a series of rallies
against Government economic policies. Neither method has been very
effective.
Indeed, the ballot box has been a better instrument of making people's views
known. At the presidential election last autumn, the defeat of Premier
Tadeusz Mazowiecki and a strong vote for Stanislaw Tyminski, a vehement
critic of the Solidarity establishment, showed many people's attitudes.
Despite the decline of the strike as a weapon, the right to set up and join
a trade union, as well as to strike, is retained in trade union legislation
now being amended by Parliament. This could cause embarrassment to foreign
employers like the Marriott hotel chain which has a policy of not permitting
employees to organise unions. But the maximum fine for the offence is a mere
Zl 5m (USDollars 537).
Still to be decided is whether employers will have the right to lock workers
out in the face of a wildcat strike.
During the debates in parliament the Solidarity leadership from Gdansk was
reduced to passively asking deputies and senators for support. This has
enhanced Solidarity's perceived need to get its own limited parliamentary
representation and led some to argue that it should go further and seek to
become part of future governments.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (29): Perilous pollution problem - The
scale of environmental woes is daunting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH in the Sudeten mountains, the forest is dying. One or two lone, grey
skeletons of trees stand stripped of their foliage, surrounded only by tree
stumps stretching away up the hillside.
Caught in the crossfire of air pollution from Czechoslovakia to the south,
and Upper Silesia to the north, the forest is a victim of rain with a pH
value measured at 2.8 on occasions - the equivalent of medium-strength acid.
Upper Silesia, the centre of Poland's coal mining and heavy industry, is
just one of five regions designated 'areas of environmental disaster' by the
Polish government in 1983.
Twenty-two others were classed as 'areas of environmental hazard'. Together
they account for 11 per cent of the land and more than a third of the
population.
The scale of Poland's environmental woes is daunting. Poles suffer an
abnormally high rate of chronic bronchitis and asthma from inhaling polluted
air. They are exposed to some of the highest dosages of carcinogens in the
world through eating food grown on soil contaminated with metal deposits.
By 1987, 95 per cent of surface water was unfit for human consumption, while
30 per cent was so heavily salinated by discharges from the mining industry
that it was as to be unfit even for industrial use.
Although the problems were recognised in the 1980s, only now is the
government able to start to confront them, helped by loans from the World
Bank, the European Community, the US and Sweden.
When the Paris Club of western creditor nations cut Poland's official debt
by 50 per cent earlier this year, the US unilaterally reduced a further 10
per cent, and agreed that another 10 per cent (Dollars 380m) would be
converted into Polish zlotys and spent on environmental projects.
The government hopes to spend a total of Dollars 1.5bn on environmental and
water supply investment in 1991, triple three times the former annual
expenditure. But the gap between what can realistically be spent in the
1990s and what is internationally called for is reckoned to be more than
Dollars 1bn a year.
To bridge the gap, Dr Maciej Nowicki, the environment minister, called in
March for a trust fund to be set up - with money diverted from servicing
Poland's foreign debt - to provide financial support to projects of
international importance. These would include controls on trans-boundary air
pollution and contamination of the Baltic Sea.
At home, new environmental laws are expected to be enacted by parliament
before the summer recess, and the government is already implementing its
environmental protection programme drawn up at the end of last year.
Underpinning the programme is the principle of 'sustainable development' to
attain a balance between social, economic, technical and environmental
conditions and development.
In practice this means investment in the treatment of pollution at source,
and the reduction of polluting industries when restructuring of the economy.
The programme stresses the efficient use of energy. Assistant Professor
Stanislaw Sitnicki, director of strategy at the Ministry of Environmental
Protection, believes that energy consumption could be cut by 20 per cent.
To this end, the Polish Foundation for Energy Efficiency was founded last
year, with sponsorship from the US government, the World Wildlife Fund
Worldwide Fund for Nature and the Conservation Foundation. Two centres in
Warsaw and Katowice will conduct research and provide training and
education, as well as advising on joint ventures.
The planned legislation will include punitive fines for polluters, and a new
'no excuses' approach. Previously many enterprises negotiated special
exemptions, or under the old accounting system were able simply to budget
for paying fines as part of their production costs.
More important, polluters will not just merely be fined, but will be held
financially responsible for the environmental damage they cause.
The ministry of environmental protection is embarking on an education
programme, which will stretch as far as mounting a special exhibition for
members of parliament.
Politicians are eager to talk about abortion, complains Mr Sitnicki, but are
not so interested in the environment. He adds that there is also a lack of
understanding of environmental problems among the general public, but not
necessarily of their scale.
Short-term priorities in the environmental programme are to tackle problems
which place human health - or life - at risk. Food production in areas such
as Upper Silesia, where the soil is affected by toxic substances, will be
gradually phased out, with compensation paid to farmers forced to switch to
different crops.
The 80 biggest polluters in Poland, identified in a government study last
year, have been set strict targets for reducing pollution by 1994-5. In the
medium term, it is hoped that Poland will come near to reaching EC pollution
targets by 2000. the turn of the century.
However, the picture is not all black. Twenty-seven per cent of Poland's
land area is virtually unspoiled, including one of the last areas of
primeval forest in Europe. to the east. Protecting these areas  - home to
bison, lynx and the occasional bear - is crucial. a major priority.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (28): A brick-shaped future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE Jaworzno colliery, in Upper Silesia, the director placed a small
cardboard box on the table.
'This,' said Mr Szczepan Perek, with pride, 'is the future of our coal
mine.'
Inside was a neat package of briquets of coal.
'Ecological fuel,' said Mr Perek triumphantly.
Smokeless fuel has been known for many years in the west, but in Poland it
is a new concept. In the case of the Jaworzno colliery, 20km west of
Katowice, it is hailed as a saviour, and proof that the future is not bleak
for all Polish mines.
Jaworzno, like the Polish constitution, celebrates its 200th anniversary
this year. But in February last year, after the colliery had been told that
the sulphur content of its coal was too high, it seemed that 4,000 of its
7,500 workers would have to be laid off.
Half a million tonnes of coal remained in store, deemed unfit for use under
Poland's stiff new laws.
Now the jobs have, apparently, been saved. The mine has exercised its right
to operate independently, and has become one of the first in Poland to
co-operate with western companies in safeguarding its future.
The mine is investing in desulphurising and enriching equipment, as well as
briquetting machinery, from Charbonnages de France, the German Helter
company, and Andritz of Austria. Along with credit from these companies, it
has received financial support from the State Coal Agency, and from the
national fund for environmental protection.
The new briquets are smokeless, low in sulphur, and, claims Mr Perek, burn
for five hours.
The product is aimed primarily at domestic consumers, and Mr Perek sees a
huge potential market, particularly in cities like Krakow, which has 240,000
individual chimneys from coal stoves.
Atmospheric pollution there is causing severe erosion of the historic
buildings.
Since the final quarter of last year, when the colliery announced that it
could in future supply desulphurised coal, Mr Perek says the Jaworzno
colliery has been inundated with orders.
When he speaks, Mr Perek already sounds like a manager in the west. 'We've
got the product, now we've got to find the market,' he says. 'We've wised up
to the market.'
Earlier, he had betrayed more than a trace of the old thinking. Unlike most
capitalists, who would be happy to talk about the signing of their latest
deal, Mr Perek and his colleagues had been most reluctant to talk.
Only after half an hour of small-talk over one or two bottles of Czech beer
did Mr Perek let out his secret.
Now he was warming to his subject.
'We are deeply convinced that we are moving in the right direction. We are
introducing new technology and helping the environment, and we feel good
about that.'
Despite the uncertainties facing the industry as a whole, Mr Perek displays
every confidence in the future of his own mine.
'We are a mine that has many years ahead. Our coal is good, and we have 270m
tonnes of reserves - that's enough for 200 years at current production
levels.'
Although the mine took its own initiative in buying new technology, Mr Perek
supports the controversial plans of the State Coal Agency to create a
national holding company.
'We are happy about it. We've seen it happen in other countries.
'Looking realistically, one mine cannot function on its own in the market.
We can do it in the Polish market, but in the EC pack we would be eaten
alive.'

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (27): Quality not quantity - Coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
COAL miners, once the proletarian elite of Polish socialism, now face an
uncertain future. The subsidies which severely distorted production and
consumption of Poland's main source of energy are to be phased out.
Reducing Poland's reliance on coal - it accounts for more than 75 per cent
of primary energy consumption compared with 24 per cent in western Europe
and 27 per cent in the US - is also a significant plank in the country's
environmental protection programme.
Output has already dropped to 147.4m tonnes last year from the claimed peak
of more than 190m tonnes in the late 1980s. This year production is likely
to be only 144m tonnes.
Mr Tadeusz Demel, general director of the State Coal Agency, says the
industry will shift its emphasis from quantity to quality - and
profitability.
Mines will no longer be kept open simply to provide employment. Many of
Poland's 68 mines are old and highly inefficient, and a study is under way
to establish which are no longer viable.
Mr Demel refuses to disclose how many mines might face closure. Last year,
48 enjoyed what he describes as a 'positive financial status' after paying
dividends and income tax. But that, he says, does not mean they are
profitable overall because the figures exclude investment costs.
Declining heavy industrial production has already meant a decline in
domestic demand. But exports also face a crisis.
Mr Jan Baranski, director of Weglokoks, the Polish coal export agency, says
rising production costs, the combination of a fixed exchange rate and high
domestic inflation, and a 20 per cent turnover tax on exports, mean that
prices may have to be increased this year.' We've reached break-even point,'
he says. 'If our costs increase much more, without a change in the exchange
rate, we'll have no choice but to increase prices.'
If this happens, Mr Baranski fears a large drop in sales - worth around
Dollars 1.5bn last year - with possible long-term consequences. Weglokoks
may try to ride out the storm by concentrating on markets closest to Poland,
thus reducing transport costs.
'To lose a market is very easy,' he says. 'To come back is very difficult,
even if it's possible at all. We must not burn the bridges we have built up
over many years.'
At home, miners who lose their jobs will face difficulties in moving to
other areas to find work because of Poland's acute housing shortage. Those
still in work have come to terms with the fact that they are no longer the
storm-troopers of socialism.
'I am first a Catholic, and then the general director of the coal agency,'
Mr Demel says. 'Closing these mines will not be easy for me. I'm not a
politician, I am just a mining engineer. I live here and I have to look
these people in the eyes.'
There is already unrest among miners. The wages tax or popiwek that
penalises employers who pay more than government-permitted wage increases
means that miners' wages have not kept pace with inflation. This has already
led to strikes and angry delegations to president Walesa.
However, without lower real wages unemployment would be greater, as in the
former East Germany.
The ending of subsidies is a key to establishing real cost and profit levels
in the industry. Last year, 9,600bn zlotys (Dollars 1bn) was spent on
subsidising coal output. This year, the subsidy will be reduced to 7,300bn
zlotys.
The goal is to end the system of flat-rate subsidies to all mines based on
output, and switch to limited subsidies to specific mines for specific
reasons.
Finally, Poland's coal mines, which gained their freedom to operate
independently last year, are to be taken under the wing of a new state
holding company, along the lines of those that exist in many western
countries.
'It is stupid to maintain that individual mines, of differing ages and
working in very different conditions, should compete against one another,'
Mr Demel says.
Understandably, some miners are strongly opposed to the move, suspicious
that it will mean a return to the bad old days of central planning. The
workers' councils are reluctant to give up their newfound freedom.
'Sometimes I speak at mines to explain my ideas, and the miners whistle and
stomp,' Mr Demel says. 'I say, I don't have to be here. Someone else, one of
you, could be here, and you would start to think the same as me.'
No-one wants to see a return to the old ways, especially as a few truths are
starting to emerge. There is some doubt, for example, over whether Poland's
coal industry was ever quite as big as was claimed.
'Speaking delicately, there were certain discrepancies when coal output was
measured, ' Mr Demel says quietly.
'During the times of central planning, mines would add stones to their coal
to make sure they met their targets. I have worked in the coal industry for
many years, I know what went on.'

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (26): Protest vote by miners - An analysis
of the so-called Tyminski effect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOWHERE was the so-called 'Tyminski effect' more marked than in the
voivodship of Walbrzych, where in some areas more than 40 per cent of people
voted for him in both rounds of the presidential elections.
In the first round, Mr Stan Tyminski beat Lech Walesa in more than a quarter
of the 40 constituencies in the region. The president of the city's public
relations office carried out an investigation into who voted for him.
'He found that 80 per cent of those who voted for him were people who had
only primary education, or only a technical education,' according to Adam
Gierak, a journalist with the left-wing newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza who lives
in the area. 'He also found that people who voted for Tyminski often did not
have the courage to admit it, or could find no reason to justify it.'
Mr Gierak says Tyminski voters could be divided into two distinct groups.
The first was people in the worst economic situation, especially miners who
have been hit hard by the Balcerowicz plan, and who face likely redundancy.
He feels this group voted for Mr Tyminski out of desperation, as a protest,
rather than making a positive and constructive choice to do so.
The second group was more influential - members of the pro-communist trade
union OPZZ, as well as members of the old party nomenklatura, and even
secret police.
Such people were apparently looking to regain some of their former power, Mr
Gierak says, and decided to back Mr Tyminski because they felt he stood more
chance of winning the election than the Social Democratic (the former
Communist Party) candidate Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz.
'Tyminski said he would come here at 4pm,' Mr Gierak says. 'But in fact he
came early in the morning for a secret meeting with OPZZ and former party
officials.'
Mr Gierak found out about this secret meeting and went along. He managed to
tape the opening, before he was discovered, thrown bodily out of the
meeting, and locked in a room until the meeting was finished.
'Later in the day, Mr Tyminski had dinner at the home of one of the OPZZ
trade unionists,' Mr Gierak adds. 'The neighbours heard about the meeting
and gathered outside the house, demanding to see Tyminski. When he came out
they feted him like a hero.'
Mr Tyminski also held an election rally, which followed the same pattern as
those held in many cities in Poland. A frail old lady came forward from the
audience, complaining about how she could scarcely afford to live on her
meagre pension. She pledged her support for Mr Tyminski, kissing his hands
and calling him 'saviour'.
A friend of Mr Gierak who was at election rallies in both Walbrzych and
Wroclaw, 70 km away, said the same old woman came forward at both meetings.
In the second round of voting, however, there was a heavy swing to Mr
Walesa, who won every constituency.
Mr Gierak says this was due to heavy pressure from the church for people to
vote for Mr Walesa, as well as what he calls a 'resurgence of patriotism'.
When it came to the crunch, the people felt Poland should be run by a native
Pole.
He doubts whether there could be a repeat of the Tyminski phenomenon. Were
it not for the uncertainty about the future of the region, and Solidarity's
failure to come up with a programme of restructuring, he says, most people
would probably never have voted for him.
In the next election, Mr Gierak believes, the alternatives to Solidarity
will be better formed, and be able to present more coherent policies. 'Once
a credible opposition emerges, no one will vote for someone like Tyminski,'
he says.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (25): In search of new gas supplies - The
energy mix is being closely examined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENERGY experts and environmentalists alike are taking a hard look at
Poland's hitherto under-explored gas reserves to change the country's energy
mix and reduce reliance on coal and Soviet gas imports.
The shift to hard-currency trading with the Soviet Union in January brought
steep increases in the domestic prices of petrol and gas - and of
electricity, which is linked to the gas price.
Around 65 per cent of Poland's gas consumption, or 8m cubic metres, is
imported from the USSR, via the Kobryn-Warsaw pipeline. Moscow wants to sell
more, but Poland wants to supplement Soviet supplies from its own natural
gas reserves, estimated at some 160bn cu m.
The World Bank has earmarked Dollars 250m for development of the gas
industry with another Dollars 61.5m promised by the European Investment
Bank.
Two bills regulating foreign exploitation of Poland's reserves are expected
to become law by the summer. More than 50 companies have expressed interest,
says Mr Andrzej Brach, director of the Polish Oil and Gas Company.
Poland produces around 4.5bn cu m of gas, accounting for 8 per cent of
energy consumption. As use of coal declines, the percentage of gas will
increase. At a minimum, it is planned gas will increase to 15 per cent of
energy consumption, based on expansion of domestic use alone. Under the
maximum-growth scenario, gas will rise to 25 per cent, and be used for
household heating, for district heating systems, and possibly for
power-generation for the first time.
Poland will, however, never be self-sufficient in gas; and, as imports from
the Soviet Union can no longer be guaranteed, the search is on for
alternative suppliers.
Oil exploitation will also be expanded, although, in the words of Mr Brach,
home production will never be more than 'a drop in the ocean'.
There are reserves estimated at some 2.2m tonnes in the Carpathian mountains
to the south-west, and in the central lowlands. The Poles believe that, with
new techniques and foreign investment, it would be possible to double the
output of 150,000 tonnes a year.
Once again, the Soviet Union has in the past provided 80 per cent of
Poland's needs - more than 12m tonnes a year. Poland is looking for other
sources of oil, particularly to Norway, to Saudi Arabia, and also to
Britain.
A new terminal is being constructed at Gdansk, which will increase the
amount of oil that can be delivered by sea from 8m tonnes a year to nearly
17m tonnes by 1994.
The rise in oil prices, following the switch to hard-currency trading with
the USSR, hit the profits of both Poland's largest oil refineries.
Gdansk, the smaller plant, with a capacity of 2.6m tonnes a year, used to
receive 80 per cent of its oil from the Soviet Union. It has now stopped
processing Soviet crude altogether. The refinery is preparing for
privatisation, and has been negotiating with potential western partners for
more than a year. According to the director, Mr Marek Sokolowski, it is
close to signing an agreement.
Petrol distribution is the preserve of CPN, the state distribution agency.
But the Gdansk refinery has begun constructing four of its own filling
stations within a 100km radius of Gdansk.
Plock, Poland's biggest refinery, with a capacity of 11.5m tonnes a year, is
also preparing for privatisation and possible partnership with the west.
Although a recent feasibility study by Credit Suisse First Boston rated
Plock third, behind two west German refineries, in a comparative survey of
more than 10 European refineries, Plock is not finding it easy to attract
foreign backers.
'More than 70 representatives from western companies have visited so far,'
says Mr Aleksander Puchowicz, the development director, rather
disappointedly, 'but none of them has been prepared to invest.'
Plock is a huge complex - four times the size of Gdansk - and has serious
pollution problems, as the fourth biggest producer of sulphur dioxide in
Poland. Reducing emissions to the target of 50 per cent of 1989 levels by
1995 will require massive investment.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (24): A step into yesteryear - Walbrzych
typifies problems faced by eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WOULD be difficult to imagine a town with more problems than Walbrzych,
in south-west Poland - or one that better illustrates the scope of the
problems faced by eastern Europe.
Coal is the main source of employment and the main source of fuel, and here
lies the problem.
Four hundred metres beneath the town, miners toil in some of the most
primitive mining conditions in Europe, crawling along tunnels only 70cm
high.
'Stepping into one of those mines is like stepping back into the 19th
century,' says Mr Pawel Kuczynski, of the social and market research firm
Demoskop, which has been involved in drawing up plans for the restructuring
of the region.
The miners have long been well-rewarded for their work, proud to wear their
distinctive uniforms. But their glory days are over.
The coal mines are finally to be closed - more than 50 years late. Scheduled
for closure even before the second world war, when Walbrzych was the German
town of Waldenburg, the mines were kept open for the war effort and then,
when the land passed to Poland after the war, for 45 loss-making years to
provide employment.
More than 23,000 people - a quarter of the workforce, and nearly a sixth of
the town's population - must eventually lose their jobs.
Poland's shortage of housing means the miners cannot be relocated elsewhere,
even though there is work available in other parts of Upper Silesia.
For the miners, redundancy will represent a particular fall from grace. They
are used to being pampered by the state - especially during the martial law,
when their special shops gave them access to goods other people could not
get.
As they were paid so well, it is more common for a miner to be the sole
breadwinner in a family than in other industries, and very few wives work. A
big change in social attitudes will be required.
The rest of the region's industry is none too healthy. The textile factories
have lost much of their main market - the Soviet Union - while the
electronics industry is having difficulty competing with western imports.
Only one out of three porcelain factories in the area is near to being
profitable.
As some enterprises close, and others seek to streamline themselves in the
battle for profitability, thousands more jobs are likely to be lost. The
socio-economic problems are, however, only the beginning.
The town suffers from some of the most severe water and atmospheric
pollution in Europe. Gases and dust from coal-burning and the huge Walbrzych
coking plant - high on the government's hit-list of the most polluting
enterprises in the country - cause acid rain, as well as respiratory
problems.
A serious shortage of water means that in some parts of Walbrzych there is
running water for only two hours a day. Of the region's river water, 2 per
cent is of 'second-class' quality, according to Polish standards. The rest
is not even suitable for industrial use.
In such conditions, health experts say, there is a high cancer risk and
danger of outbreaks of food-related illness such as salmonella. Along with
the threat of cancer, some experts fear that the high quantities of
carcinogens in the air and in food grown in the region could damage
inhabitants' immunological barriers, by attacking the T-cells, or so-called
'soldier cells' of the body's immune system, in a similar way to the Aids
virus.
Then there is the subsidence. In their desperation to keep miners in work,
the authorities allowed them to mine into the supportive pillars beneath the
town of Walbrzych. The walls of residential blocks have started to crack,
and one railway bridge has already sunk 10 feet into the ground. The town
centre itself has been undermined, and even divine patronage has not been
able to prevent the spire of the Church of the Guardian Angels from starting
to lean.
Worst of all is the uncertainty. It has been announced that the mines will
close, and a liquidator has been appointed, but there has been no decision
on when this will be.
Neither the French consultants, nor Solidarity's special plenipotentiary,
nor the town or voivodship administration have been able to come up with any
concrete plan for restructuring the region.
Young people, deeply uncertain about their future, are turning to crime and
gang-fighting. One gang, the Depeszowcy, or fans of British pop group
Depeche Mode - a band not noted for its cheery optimism - recently killed a
heavy-metal fan by pushing him under a train.
As Adam Gierak, a local journalist with the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, puts
it: 'Better to have certainty about bad things than uncertainty.'
Mr Josef Gruszka, the harassed-looking Solidarity plenipotentiary, charged
with drawing up plans for the future of the region, jokes: 'Sometimes I
think to myself: should we buy ropes for everybody to hang themselves, so as
not to suffer any more?'
Yet the region does have possibilities. Closing the mines would free
considerable sums of money from subsidies and miners' wages, to be spent on
other things.
The authorities are considering a scheme to give ex-miners loans, possibly
interest-free, to set up small businesses.
If the pollution can be controlled, land in the north-eastern part of the
province is good for agriculture. Factories could be built to process and
pack the produce.
Without the pollution, the region could also attract tourists. To the south,
the Sudeten mountains provide excellent skiing. Before the war, the German
skiing team used to train near the town of Zieleniec, and there are nine
former health spas in the region.
Finally, the mines may yet provide a key to Walbrzych's recovery - but as
sources of methane, not of coal. Both American and French companies have
expressed interest in exploiting the sizeable reserves.
The great lack is foreign investment. Dutch, Italian, Austrian, French and
American companies have all been to the region to discuss investment or
joint ventures. None has yet come forward with any money.
One problem is that no framework exists yet for facilitating contact and
negotiation between western companies and enterprises in Walbrzych. Mr
Gruszka adds that local conditions and proposals must be clear before any
deals are made with the west.
'I'm not xenophobic,' he says, but capitalism is not a game of cricket, it's
poker.'
On a wall in an alleyway in Walbrzych, someone has daubed the words Chwytaj
dzien], the Polish equivalent of carpe diem ('Seize the day'). The town
might do well to adopt it as a motto. When it comes to tackling Walbrzych's
problems, there is no more time for dithering.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (22): 'Too busy for fun' - Problems of the
new rich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROWS OF smart Mercedes cars gleam through the display window in a shop on
Warsaw's main Krakowskie Przedmiescie street, which once sold olive green
uniforms to the military.
When the showroom opened recently, it sold some 50 vehicles in the first few
days to rich Poles who no longer have to be shy about having money.
In contrast to the communists who hoped to work wonders with the working
class the present government has the creation of 'a middle class' written
into its political programme.
At times, though, displays of wealth attract open signs of anger. 'A woman
spat on my windscreen as I stood at the traffic lights in my expensive car,'
said one businessman. 'I don't really blame her, it cost more than she'll
earn in her life.
'But she doesn't realise I'm so busy I don't have any time to enjoy the
things I can now afford,' he adds bitterly.
Ms Malgosia Piwkowska from Sopot, a popular resort on the Baltic, who is
opening a menswear shop there in the summer, reckons she will be selling 100
Giorgio Armani suits a month.' But I won't just be selling clothes, I'll be
advising men what to wear and when to wear it,' she says of her project
which promises a monthly turnover of Dollars 30,000.
It's a service which could well be gratefully received as Poland's new money
looks for pointers on how to behave when dealing with their rich and
powerful foreign partners. These are the ones on the way up working hard to
make their first million dollars.
Several hundred, though, according to Mr Wiktor Kubiak, the owner of Batax
Ltd, a trading company, are already worth between Dollars 5m to Dollars 10m.
The capital was mostly accumulated, he says, over the past two years.
Mr Kubiak is rich, too, and he is one of the first of his kind to have
invested in the performing arts and is planning to buy a Warsaw theatre.
He says he has put more than Dollars 1m into Metro, a musical which he hopes
to promote on Broadway. In the meantime, it is playing to packed houses in
Warsaw to disapproving stares from theatre people used to a more staid
cultural diet. But state subsidies to the arts are being cut and private
money will be essential if many artists are to survive.
The arts are not the only sphere where the rich are beginning to dabble.
Politics is another.
When Mr Algirdas Saudargis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, arrived in
Poland last January charged with setting up a government in exile soon after
the tragic shootings in Vilnius, Mr Jan Walczyk, the owner of the Zajazd
Napoleonski hotel, and his rich friends helped him set up an office.
It may have been one of the first foreign policy initiatives taken
independently of the government by the newly rich.
Mr Slawomir Jaruga, a successful businessman from Lodz, provided an example
of domestic political ambitions when he split the UPR, a small free-market
party in an attempt to become its leader.
The rich are also beginning to take an interest in restoring crumbling
country houses once owned by the gentry.
Some money is being spent abroad. Indeed, children are beginning to be
educated at foreign schools and a few are already enjoying their own yachts
on the Mediterranean.
Art auctions are fashionable, and Mr Wojciech Fibak, the tennis player,
recently paid Dollars 47,000 for a symbolist painting by Jacek Malcewski at
a sale organised by the Unicum auction house at the Victoria
Intercontinental hotel.
The Warsaw rich tend to live in leafy suburbs in large comfortable houses
surrounded by high walls protected by large dogs and hired private
bodyguards. Horse riding, tennis, eating out and charity dances at the
Warsaw Marriott are all part of their lifestyle.
A ball next Saturday in the Gdynia Hotel should provide a review of a class
in statu ascendi. It is being organised by a local group of the Lion's Club
to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the first constitution. Mrs Danuta
Walesa, the president's wife, is an honorary patron as is Mr Jan Krzysztof
Bielecki, the prime minister. Dinner jackets will be worn.

Last year Mr Gawronik imported one in five litres of petrol bought by Polish
motorists and Esso has signed him up to sell its lubricants. His business
took off two years ago with the legalisation of private foreign exchange
dealing.
Up to now all his exchange offices have been on Poland's western borders or
main cities. Now he is about to open his first exchange office on the
Polish-Soviet border to do business with the 12,000 Soviet citizens who
cross the border daily. But foreign exchange dealing now accounts for only
one seventh of Mr Gawronik's turnover which last year rose sharply to
2,400bn zlotys, around Dollars 250m.
He is now expanding into insurance, freight forwarding, arranging VAT
refunds and oil refining.
Mr Hubert Janiszewski, former vice-president of the state Foreign Investment
Agency and now director of the private Polish Investment Company, staffed
mainly by Anglo-Polish financial advisers, describes Mr Gawronik as ' a
product of our times'.

transforming the economy by moving fast to grasp opportunities opened up by
the often chaotic transition from state-owned to private economy.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (20): Structural changes inevitable -
Anthony Robinson examines Europe's last bastion of peasant farming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND is the last bastion of peasant farming in Europe. Stalin, who
cynically recognised that 'imposing communism on Poland is like saddling a
cow', accepted that imposing Soviet-style collectivisation was beyond the
reach of local communists.
After the war, the big estates were seized and broken up. But most of the
large state farms were established in the western part of the country, on
former German land abandoned in the face of the Red Army's advance and then
incorporated into the new People's Republic. Around 75 per cent of the land,
split into 2.7m farms, has remained for more than 40 years in the hands of
peasant proprietors.
But, as a recent World Bank study of Polish agriculture underlines, 'the
rural sector, although mostly private, was, and still is, totally dependent
on the state and co-operative sectors for the procurement of all inputs and
services and for the sale of all production'. Reform of the farming sector
fundamentally means abolishing this artificial and distorting relationship
which meant that for 40 years farmers despised and mistrusted the state, yet
acquired a dangerous dependency upon it.
This 'withering away' of the Marxist state is now being tackled with gusto.
Dramatic changes are under way with the abolition of consumer subsidies on
food, a sharp fall in producer subsidies and growing competition from
imports - including politically sensitive subsidised imports from European
Community countries.
Nearly 30 per cent of the population is still employed in agriculture, so
reforming the agricultural sector is politically highly sensitive.
Farmers, still largely hooked on the attitudes of the past, continue to
demand minimum guaranteed prices and protection from imports. Like their
counterparts in the European Community they frequently blockade towns and
throw eggs (and worse) at politicians.
But, with 24 per cent of all farms less than two hectares in size and the
average size of private farms under six hectares, huge structural changes
leading to fewer, larger and more productive farms are inevitable.
At the same time, the voices of Poland's old landed aristocracy are to be
heard demanding the return of at least part, if not all, of their old
pre-war estates.
Many of the small farms will disappear naturally over time as their ageing
proprietors die out. Their farms will be absorbed and consolidated into
larger units, a process made infinitely easier in Poland by the very fact
that private property ownership - and hence its legal sale or transference -
was never abolished through collectivisation. Existing state farms are
likely to be converted into genuine co-operatives.
The hope is that dispossessed farmers will find alternative employment in
the expansion of underdeveloped rural services in food processing, transport
and marketing. It is here, in the privatisation of the former monopolistic
state marketing and processing sectors that the World Bank pinpointed the
greatest scope for investment, rationalisation and growth.
'Agricultural production should be on land that is essentially private.
Similarly marketing, transport, processing and storage activities should be
private. As for prices they should be determined by market forces', the Bank
report indicated.
It also underlined the need for Poland to have access to foreign markets.
'Agriculture should be free to use all trade possibilities, domestically and
internationally, since this is the only way it can fully exploit its
competitive advantage at any given time.' Brave words - totally contradicted
in the annex by this advice from the European Community, co-author of the
report. 'The government should allow itself all types of border measures
including quantitive restrictions to set the price of cereals where, for
political reasons, it would like it to be.' The EC also recommended that
domestic prices should be stabilised by a system of EC-style variable export
taxes/subsidies and corresponding import measures . . . 'and aim
deliberately for an agricultural production somewhat below
self-sufficiency.'
It is advice such as this which fuels the growing conviction that eastern
and central Europe will only achieve its desired integration into a larger
European Community after a huge battle for fundamental reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP).
Meanwhile, Polish farmers and the government face the immediate problem of
how to dispose of last year's surplus of grain, meat, potatoes, sugar beet
and other products. On his trip to Moscow last month, Prime Minister Jan
Bielecki offered the Soviets 1m tons of grain and 100,000 tons of meat. The
Soviets replied they had no cash, were not prepared to deliver more oil in
exchange but were prepared to supply more gas and consider barter deals
involving ferrous and non-ferrous minerals and other products. Talks
continue.
The trade issue is becoming increasingly serious - both because Polish
farming has become more productive over the last decade and because plans
for 4-5 per cent annual growth in agricultural production depend on export
outlets. Last year Poland produced a record 28m tons of grain, up 1.5m tons
from 1989, and 2.4m tons of meat. Sugar beet production was also 300,00 tons
higher at 2.1m tons. Farm exports last year at Dollars 2.1bn exceeded
imports of Dollars 897m to provide a Dollars 1.2bn net contribution to the
overall trade surplus.
Higher exports were also a function of lower domestic demand, itself a
function of the sharply higher prices which followed the abolition of
consumer price subsidies. The meat and food queues which were once the butt
of countless Polish jokes, and countless wasted queuing hours, are now a
thing of the past. So is the wastage associated with feeding cheap processed
food to pigs.
In the old days the joke was that the well-fed Czech dog would visit Poland
from time to time because in Poland, although there was nothing to eat, a
dog at least had the freedom to bark.
It is now possible in Poland to both bark and eat. The only question is how
to pay for it.

Profile: Count Jan Zamoyski

<TEXT>
COUNT JAN ZAMOYSKI, nearing 80, is the very model of a Polish gentleman. He
slips easily into English and French and feels just a little satisfaction at
having managed to outlive the communists to see the promise of better times.
His father, Maurycy, was Poland's largest landowner in 1918 when the country
regained its independence and he helped pay the largest part of the bills
for Poland's delegation at the Versailles Peace Conference which established
a shortlived post-war European order.
When the count inherited the family estate in 1937 it amounted to 61,000
hectares and 10 industrial plants including a brewery and a furniture
factory.
Now he is a leading light of the Polish Society of Industrialists which,
along with its fraternal Landowners' Association, is seeking to have
property confiscated by the communists restored or compensation paid at the
very least.' I'm not too interested in the farming part,' he admits, tacitly
recognising that any move to return the land given to the peasants by the
communists in 1944 and 1945 would be enormously unpopular.
'However, when I go into the forests we once had I still think of the trees
as being my own,' he says, his kind smile free of any rancour.
As to the prospect of having his family's businesses returned, he's a
'restrained optimist'.
And societies like his continue to attract support, including that of
President Lech Walesa, on the grounds that past wrongs should be righted.
Indeed, the government recently decided after much soul-searching that the
budget really could not afford any full-scale restoration of property and
what compensation there would be, would be in the form of vouchers
exchangeable for shares in soon-to-be-privatised state sector companies.
'I don't want the children to say that I didn't try,' Count Zamoyski says of
his efforts, which if successful would turn him once more into a wealthy
man.
It would be a far cry from the two rooms the seven members of his family
occupied in 1958 when he was released from prison after serving almost eight
years on a trumped up spying charge.
During the war, the Germans had allowed him to administer his estate and all
the while he had been an active member of the underground.
Before his arrest by the communists he worked for a western shipping line
and after his release for Swissair in Warsaw.
He decided against emigration, making a conscious decision to live at home
rather than abroad. 'I'm tied to this land,' he says.
It's a stance which is in line with the family's political tradition which
this century favoured the National Democrats (ND), a pre-war nationalist
right-wing party.
Indeed, Count Zamoyski is now actively trying to unite various disparate
small political groups in the ND tradition and recently became the chairman
of a renascent National Democrat party which he hopes will act as a nucleus
for a larger movement.
He also always took an active interest in and sought funds for the
restoration of Zamosc founded in 1580 by his namesake, who laid the
foundations of family's fortune in the 16th century.
Zamosc, in eastern Poland, is a rare example of renaissance town planning
and its present mayor, Marcin Zamoyski, is the successor to the family
title.
He is there because after the local elections in the spring of last year the
citizens asked the count to be their mayor. He suggested his son and they
accepted.
'I don't know how long he will be able to hold on to the job as the
honeymoon between the council and the mayor lasted two weeks,' he says.
Indeed, Marcin Zamoyski's trials in Zamosc are typical of Poland's first
encounter with local democracy. A fractious council is at odds with the
official it appointed in the first place, while a local clique with its
roots in the communist past is seeking to corrupt the new establishment.
For the moment, though, Count Zamoyski argues that the return of plant such
as the Zamosc furniture factory would be the simplest way of restoring it to
sound management.
He has been in touch with IKEA, the Swedish furniture group, on possible
joint projects and he has plans for 'his' local brewery, too.
But in the materialistic era that Poland has now embraced the count points
out that the aristocracy which he represents does have another role to play.
'We can show that there are cultural values, beside the mere material ones,'
he says.

foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON

<TEXT>
POLAND is determined never again to be isolated, or to be treated as a mere
buffer zone between prosperous western Europe and a disintegrating Soviet
Union.
Behind its fierce determination to become a fully-fledged member of the
European Community lies the moral conviction that the west owes something,
not only to Poland but to all of central Europe, for the betrayal of Munich
in 1938 and for the Yalta agreements which left Poland and its neighbours
interned for more than 40 years behind the Iron Curtain. It was in this
spirit that Poland joined Czechoslovakia and Hungary at a tripartite summit
meeting in February at Visegrad castle in Slovakia to co-ordinate their
approach to the EC and lend each other mutual assistance in the building of
constitutional democracies in their countries.
But, as President Lech Walesa's recent trips to the United States and
forthcoming visit to Moscow indicate, Poland is also determined to be an
active participator in whatever wider world order emerges from the state of
flux.
Since his election last December, President Walesa, whose presidential
powers remain to be defined in a new constitution, has made clear that he
intends to play an active diplomatic as well as domestic political role. On
his visits to the US, Britain, France and the European Community
headquarters in Brussels, his basic message has been that Poles deserve
special credit for having played the decisive role in the events which led
to the crumbling of Soviet hegemony over eastern Europe and the virtually
bloodless end to the cold war.
His visit to the US, where Polish-Americans form an influential lobby, was
crowned by US support for large-scale debt relief, symbolised by the US
decision to reduce its outstanding debt by 20 per cent over and above the 50
per cent debt reduction agreed by the Paris club of official creditors.
When he goes to Moscow later this month, he will argue forcefully for the
prompt withdrawal of the nearly 50,000 Soviet troops in Poland and seek to
put political and economic relations with Moscow and the individual
republics on a new plane, as befits relations between sovereign states. On
the economic front, Prime Minister Jan Bielecki is leading efforts to
jump-start trade between the two countries, virtually paralysed since the
shift from rouble- to dollar-based trading on January 1.
Much patient work has already been done by the previous government, led by
Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, to create the conditions for a new, less strained
relationship between the two sides. This includes recognition by the Soviet
side that the NKVD, precursor of the present KGB, did indeed murder Polish
officers in the Katyn woods and other venues during the war, an admission of
great psychological importance to both sides.
But Poland is the only former Warsaw Pact country not to have signed a
formal troop withdrawal agreement and negotiations with the Soviets became
noticeably stiffer as conservative forces regained ground in Moscow. The
Soviet side have proposed withdrawing all forces by the end of 1993. But
during his election campaign Mr Walesa promised to get them out this year,
although a compromise which allowed a limited Soviet presence to supervise
the transit of Soviet troops from eastern Germany is possible.
Mr Walesa is the big picture man, determined to give a high profile to
Poland's main foreign policy objectives. Significantly, however, Mr
Krzysztof Skubiszewski, the foreign minister, was one of only two ministers
to be retained in the new government formed in January by Mr Bielecki. The
other was Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the minister of finance. A respected former
academic, Mr Skubiszewski says that co-operation with the president is good
although 'competences are not always clear and defined'.
Much has already been achieved. German reunification means that Poland's
western border now abuts directly on to the European Community. Ratification
of the Polish-German border treaty earlier this year assures international
recognition of western borders. These incorporate former German land given
to Poland by Stalin in recompense for former Polish land incorporated into
the Soviet Union in 1945.
The subsequent agreement lifting visa restrictions between the two countries
on April 8 allows Poles free access not only to Germany but also to France,
Italy and the Benelux countries under the terms of the Schengen agreement on
visa-free travel. Talks on a fully-fledged friendship treaty between the two
countries, however, remain stalled over the rights of ethnic Germans and
other details.
The collapse of Comecon trade, the re-negotiation of foreign debt, the need
to attract foreign investment to breathe life into the privatisation process
and the long-term objective of entry into the European Community by 2000
have all given a substantial economic and financial content to Polish
foreign policy.
Although the foreign ministry is in overall charge of the EC negotiations
Warsaw recently appointed Mr Jacek Saryusz-Wolski as 'plenipotentiary for
European integration and foreign assistance' to harmonise and co-ordinate
the approach to Europe and report to the Council of Ministers. Similarly, Mr
Janusz Sawicki, the deputy finance minister, is in charge of the complex
multilateral and bilateral debt negotiations. Both are prime examples of the
highly-motivated, competent and tough-minded technocrats now at the
forefront of Poland's efforts to create the external conditions for its
transformation to an economically prosperous, politically 'normal'
democracy.
Meanwhile, many ordinary Poles are awaiting the third visit next month from
the Pope, who played such an important role in keeping hope for a brighter
future alive during the dark days of martial law. With unemployment rising
and little chance of greater prosperity for some time to come, many will be
looking for Papal reassurance that their struggles will lead to a better
future.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (19): Loving and hating the dead -
Present-day attitudes to the Jews
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY POLONSKY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY, there are barely 10,000 Jews in Poland. These last remnants of one of
the largest and most vibrant Jewish communities in the world, a community
which in 1939 numbered 3.5m, are mostly elderly and it will be an extremely
difficult task to ensure the survival of Jewish life in Poland for another
generation
Yet, the impact on Polish life of the consciousness of this community, whose
traces can be found everywhere - in buildings, in cultural life and in
peoples' memories - is enormous. As in so many other aspects of life, the
Poles seem mesmerised by the past and still preoccupied by the issues which
dominated it.
On the Jewish issue, sharply divided and contradictory opinions can be
encountered among Poles, sometimes even in the same individual. On the one
hand, there has been, since the late 1970s, a revival of interest in the
Polish-Jewish past. Partly this is the result of nostalgia, in the largely
mono-ethnic and mono-religious Poland of today (though its homogeneity
should not be exaggerated), for the more colourful Poland of the past, with
its mixture of religions and nationalities.
Partly, too, it is the result of a growing awareness that it is impossible
to give a coherent account of Polish history and culture without taking into
account the contribution of the national minorities, in particular the Jews.
Above all,it is the product of a desire to come to terms with the less
attractive features of the Polish past, principally chauvinism and
anti-Semitism. This preoccupation, strong among a section of the Polish
intelligentsia, was stimulated by the higher sense of self-esteem created by
the emergence of Solidarity, which seemed to negate the western stereotype
of the Poles as impractical and incompetent dreamers. It was best
articulated by the literary critic Jan Blonski, who wrote in a widely
discussed article in 1987:
'We did take the Jews into our home, but we made them live in the cellar.
When they wanted to come into the drawing-room, our response was, Yes, but
only after you cease to be Jews, when you become 'civilised' . . . There
were those among the Jews who were ready to adhere to this advice. No sooner
did they do this than we, in turn, began talking of an invasion of Jews, of
the danger of their infiltration of Polish society. Then we started to put
down conditions . . . that we shall accept as Poles only those Jews willing
to co-operate in attempts to stem Jewish influence in our society . . .
'Eventually, when we lost our home, and when in its premises the invaders
set to murdering Jews, did we show solidarity towards them? How many of us
decided it was none of our business? There were also those (and I leave out
of account common criminals) who were secretly pleased that Hitler had
solved for us 'the Jewish problem'. We would not even welcome and honour the
survivors, even if they were embittered, disorientated and perhaps somewhat
tiresome. I repeat: instead of haggling and justifying ourselves, we should
just consider our own faults and weaknesses. This is the moral revolution
that is imperative when considering the Polish-Jewish past. It is only this
that can gradually cleanse our desecrated soil.'
At the same time, the end of communist rule in Poland has been accompanied
by a great increase in the expression of anti-Semitic sentiments. Partly
this is the result of the end of censorship. These views were probably
always present but now can be uttered openly with impunity. Partly, too, it
is the result of the dislocations caused by the difficult transition to a
market economy and a plural political system. The temptation to blame
present hardships on a 'hidden' Jewish or masonic hand has a long tradition
in Poland.
The belief that communism in Poland was a Jewish phenomenon and the
protracted conflict over the Carmelite convent in Auschwitz concentration
camp also fuelled anti-Semitism. The political conflict within the
Solidarity camp was a bitter one with many characteristics of a family feud.
President Walesa is certainly no anti-Semite. But in his presidential
campaign he failed clearly to condemn those of his supporters who attacked
the Mazowiecki government as being too subject to Jewish influence. He also
described himself as 'a full-blooded Pole with documents going back to his
great-grandfathers to prove it'.
Before the campaign began he argued that 'persons of Jewish origin should
not conceal this', a statement he justified during the campaign on the
following grounds:
'Chauvinistic and anti-Semitic views and manifestations . . . appear because
the present political set-up lacks clarity. There is confusion . . . as to
whose interest the administration represents. The personal configurations
and the question of responsibility are unclear . . . The functioning
mechanism of the state structure must be made transparent, cliques smashed,
and competence - not mafia arrangements - be relied on. Then this
suspiciousness (about Jews in government) will disappear.'
The conflict between the two sets of views about the Jews' role in Poland is
really an argument over the future of the country. Attitudes towards the
Jews are a touchstone for more fundamental views. What is at issue is
whether the Poland of the future will be inward-looking, prey to conspiracy
theories of politics and chauvinist, or pluralistic, western-oriented and
tolerant.
A number of recent developments give grounds for cautious optimism. The
pastoral letter of the Polish bishops of January 20, 1991, was the first
unequivocal condemnation by the hierarchy of anti-Semitism. Similarly,
President Walesa has gone out of his way to repudiate his own behaviour
during the presidential campaign. He has repeatedly attempted to reassure
the Jewish world of his hostility to anti-Semitism and has set up a
high-level commission to improve Polish-Jewish relations.
Speaking to a visiting Jewish delegation shortly after his election, he
affirmed: 'Anti-Semitism has been a serious problem here. We need to build a
pluralistic society. We must do this and we will do it.'
Let us hope he and his compatriots succeed.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (17): The prerequisites of prosperity - A
new respect has emerged for capitalist financial institutions and for
success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON

<TEXT>
ONE OF the unexpected side-effects of the collapse of authoritarian, command
economies throughout central and eastern Europe is a new respect for the
capitalist institutions which help create a 'level playing ground' - and a
new recognition of the linkage between democracy and prosperity.
Both points were forcibly made by Prime Minister Jan Krzysztof Bielecki in
his speech to the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London after
attending last month's inauguration of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (EBRD) - itself the first pan-European institution of the
post-cold war period.
A self-confessed 'liberal economist', Mr Bielecki argued nevertheless that
recent east German experience indicated that the classic
leave-it-to-the-market approach was 'inherently flawed' in relation to the
needs of the post-communist countries with their 'fragile, even non-existent
market controls'. Instead, he argued, governments themselves have to manage
the transition to a market economy 'by creating the legislative and
administrative machinery that underpins the market and which is taken for
granted in the west'.
In Poland's case, the creation of financial and other institutions based
largely on already existing institutions and methods in use by European
Community countries is proceeding apace. The deliberate aim is to create
that intricate web of laws, institutions and interconnected services which
Stalinist theory despised as non-productive but which capitalist practice
has demonstrated as the prerequisite of prosperity.
A stock exchange, that quintessential capitalist tool, opened to much
razzamatazz in Warsaw last month, although it will only really start
operating regularly from June. Sited in the building which once central
committee, its functioning is closely modelled on the Lyons bourse.
The combination of hard times in the City of London and the awesome size of
the potential demand for financial expertise in all aspects of
privatisation, evaluation, accounting and legal work has made Warsaw a
temporary Mecca for hordes of City firms and foreign banks.
International institutions such as the World Bank, the International
Monetary Fund, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the European
Commission have all set up shop-assessing projects, disbursing loans and
greatly improving the quality and availability of statistics and analysis.
Meanwhile, Poland is busy setting up its own Development Bank, modelled
closely on Germany's post-war Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau. The bank is
headed by Mr Wojciech Kostrzewa and advised by Mr Matthew Olex, one of three
vice-presidents, who used to run capital market operations for Lloyds Bank.
Its main functions will be to act as a partner for the World Bank and other
institutions and concentrate on restructuring state enterprises and
investment in small and medium private companies. Three foreign banks, from
France, Austria and Italy, are expected to take a joint 10 per cent stake
shortly.
The recently created EBRD is expected to work closely with all these
institutions in part-funding projects and seeking out potential equity
investments in the rapidly privatising economy and newly-created Polish
companies.
Last year more than 500,000 new businesses were registered in Poland, mostly
in the retail trade, wholesale and warehousing, road transport and related
services and construction. Many failed in their first year. The great
majority are small and under-capitalised. But they are the seed corn out of
which will grow the middle class of the future.
This is the prospect which underpins the effort to create an insurance
industry, based largely on UK practice, build up unit trusts and develop a
competitive commercial banking system. More than 65 private banks have been
authorised over the last 18 months while the IFC and World Bank are involved
in a project to provide technical assistance to nine former branch offices
of the National Bank of Poland. These have been hived off to form nine
state-owned commercial banks. Two of the nine are slated for privatisation
this year and the IFC is busy setting up 'twinning arrangements' with
foreign banks.
A shake-up is also taking place in foreign trade financing where 15 banks
have now been granted foreign exchange licenses and a new Export Development
Bank has been set up. The new arrangement is expected to sharpen competition
for Bank Handlowy, which up to now has accounted for around 90 per cent of
Polish foreign trade financing. But the bank, under its US-trained new
president, Mr Cezary Stypulkowski, plans to streamline its traditional
business in the rapidly expanding foreign trade area and to add retail
banking, corporate finance and other operations to its services.
But the need to attract foreign investment and privatise and restructure
small- and medium-sized state companies has also created big opportunities
for entrepreneurial merchant banking services such as those offered by the
Polish Investment Company (PIC). Owned and staffed mainly by bilingual
Anglo-Polish professionals with a wide range of financial experience in the
City and elsewhere, the PIC, in which Swiss bank Corporation also has a 23
per cent stake, is in some ways a symbol of the new, professional Poland now
rapidly emerging.

THE experienced western banker clutched his drink nervously at a party at
the Warsaw Marriott and, looking around the room, said: 'You know, doing
business here scares the hell out of me.'
His panic comes from working in an environment where few private business
have any history, and where the traditional way has been to set false trails
for the communist taxman rather than establish track records for credit
officers.
'You never really know who you're doing a deal with and there's always the
fear that too late,' he explains.
His problems are compounded by the fact that Poland's private entrepreneurs
have learned the lesson that appearances make the man, and many invest in a
Mercedes before buying their first machine tool to establish their
credibility.
'Some you see driving around in what represents 90 per cent of their working
capital,' says one referring to his colleagues.
Indeed, the Polish American Enterprise Fund, a US government-financed
initiative designed to boost the private sector, has invested some Dollars
10m. But it has found it is spending some 40 per cent of its effort on
checking the information it is given by hopeful borrowers.
Its project application form is a 15-page leaflet which not only asks about
the loan proposal but delves deep into the applicant's past, including his
entire employment record and home addresses for the past 10 years and his
family's financial standing.
Some time is bound to elapse before things improve as the sector providing
information to business about companies is yet in its infancy.
The locally-owned Business Industry Information Agency (IBIA), with a staff
of 50, is one of the first offering such a service. A file providing the
essential facts including its financial results for the past three years
about a company can be provided within 10 days for Dollars 100 and the
company deals with between 60 and 100 inquiries a month.
Some, indeed, come from Polish companies who want details about western
partners with whom they are considering a deal. Its head, Mr Jaroslav Govin,
says the basis of the information on Polish companies he provides comes from
the interested party.
'It's still difficult to break down barriers and some companies react to a
request for figures by threatening to take us to court, as if we were doing
something illegal,' he says.
'But we explain to them that we are doing the research on behalf of a
western company which wants to invest or a bank which wants to lend them
money and that it would be counter-productive if they were to refuse to show
us anything. They usually see the point,' he adds, but admits that around 25
per cent refuse to co-operate.
The IBIA can also turn to records kept in the courts under company law which
require private companies to present annual accounts and other key
information in special files.
Then there is the opinion of the bank where the company has its account as
to its creditworthiness which banks issue after their client has given the
go-ahead.
Tax records, however, are inaccessible. The researchers also trawl through
local newspapers to turn up information and the fact that the Gazeta
Bankowa, a financial weekly, is in the same group is a help.
The IBIA's customers from abroad come mainly from France, largely due to a
link with Coface, the export credit insurance agency and then Austria and
Italy. It also has an office in the Soviet Union and is in a position to
deal with enquiries on companies in Moscow and Vilnius.

<TEXT>
'WET' and 'dry' are relative terms in Poland. But, with unemployment rising,
wholesale closure of factories imminent and autumn elections on the horizon,
it would be extraordinary if the 'Balcerowicz plan' with its emphasis on the
fight against inflation, tight money and balanced budgets did not face
strong internal opposition. It does.
Mr Jerzy Eysmont, the 54-year-old head of the Central Planning Office, one
of only two ministers from the main-stream Centre Alliance in a government
dominated by 'liberal' free-marketeers, is the main advocate of an
alternative, 'riskier', economic policy. He worked with Mr Balcerowicz on an
earlier, abortive plan for radical economic reforms in 1979-81 and was an
economic adviser to Solidarity during martial law.
'The Finance Minister wants inflation down to 1-2 per cent per month. I'm
not so tough. I want inflation to be lower than 1990, and without the big
monthly variations, but I'm more concerned with breaking out of the
recession,' he says.
While the government aims for annual inflation of around 32 per cent this
year Mr Eysmont says a reduction from 250 per cent in 1991 to 'no more than
100 per cent this year and 50 per cent in 1992' would be more reasonable
given Poland's fragile political and economic situation.' I think Poland
will be politically more stable if the private sector, in particular, can
still grow.' But,'if the government does not change its policy it risks
being thrown out', he warns.
While conscious of the need to comply with Poland's IMF agreement the
intense university professor, who specialised in the macroeconomic
application of computers to economic forecasting, questions the commitment
to a balanced budget. 'I think it is better to have a moderate deficit and
create conditions for growth rather than a balanced budget accompanied by
recession,' he argues.
'We must take risks. The greatest danger is stagflation. We have to give
dynamism to society, but if we concentrate too rigorously on lowering
inflation we will employ brakes which are safe but tie our hands,' he
argues.
His view seems to reflect the thinking of President Walesa who recognises
the international credibility won by Mr Balcerowicz, but is no economist and
places his faith in foreign investment attracted by broader political
arguments rather than confidence in Polish economic management per se.
As to exchange rate stability, another element of the Balcerowicz strategy,
Mr Eysmont believes that 'a floating rate is desirable in the near future.'
Mr Eysmont, who was deported to Khazakstan as a child and was sacked from
the planning ministry after martial law, cites the collapse of exports to
the Soviet Union as the main reason for abandoning the acknowledged anchor
function of a fixed exchange rate, but also cites the difficulty of
exporting to western markets.
'We need a solution which allows rapid modernisation of technology and this
means incentives for foreign investment,' he says. 'But the main aim must be
to develop the economy with Polish capital.'
A strong supporter of rapid privatisation, Mr Eysmont argues that selling
state enterprises and encouraging house building would ease inflation and
channel higher incomes into investment rather than consumption.
With elections looming, the case for monetary and fiscal relaxation is bound
to look increasingly attractive. The hardest test for Mr Balcerowicz, is yet
to come.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (12): Flight plan of national carrier under
review - Profile: Lot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARSAW'S new international airport, due for completion next year, could
become the regional hub for one of the world's most dynamic markets in the
21st century. The new runway and expanded terminal facilities being built by
Hochtief of Germany alongside the present crowded baggage and customs hall,
should relieve the growing congestion of western European airports and
provide a vital freight and passenger interchange in the geographical heart
of Europe.
This vision of the future is central to the privatisation plans of Lot, the
Polish state-owned national carrier. Mr Bronislaw Klimaszewski, who returned
to the company last year as general director after being sacked as
commercial director following the imposition of martial law in 1981, has
already begun preliminary talks with airlines such as Air France, Lufthansa
and El Al.
But before Lot has any realistic chance of becoming an attractive partner it
has to dispose of its fleet of uneconomic Soviet-built aircraft, cut back on
a payroll stuffed with retired military and security personnel and create a
new ethos for what used to be, in effect, a semi-military organisation.
There are only two potential buyers for Lot's seven long-range Ilyushin-62,
14 medium-range Tupolev 154 and seven Tu-134's - the Soviet Union itself and
China. Negotiations are under way with both. But a sale to China requires
agreement from Moscow, which would have to guarantee spare parts and other
services to the new owner. Moscow, desperate to keep its aircraft factories
busy, would preferto sell new aircraft directly to China.
On the other hand Aeroflot, the Soviet airline, is itself in the throes of a
major re-organisation. This should lead to the establishment of many
smaller, regional and republic-based airlines which could be potential
buyers of Lot's redundant fleet.
Meanwhile, Lot, which has already leased three Boeing 767's from the US
manufacturer, plans to lease two similar aircraft to replace its long-range
Ilyushin-62s and is negotiating with Boeing, McDonnell and Airbus for eight
medium-range aircraft to replace its 14 Tu-154s. A further eight
Franco-Italian ATR-72 turboprop aircraft are on order to replace obsolete
Antonov-24 aircraft and the ageing Tu 134s.
In the face of union protests, 1,500 of Lot's 8,000 employees are being
dismissed. Staffing should be further trimmed to around 5,000 once the
fuel-thirsty and expensive-to-maintain Soviet jets are replaced by efficient
western aircraft.
But getting to the point where Lot will be an attractive proposition for
foreign investors and potential partners will be hard and expensive. 'I
think that the combination of Lot and the new Warsaw airport will be an
attractive and interesting proposition within the next three to four years.
But we'll need government finance and subsidies until then,' says Mr
Klimaszewski who has called in the French bank, Credit Commerciale, to carry
out an audit and evaluation.
Until now, he adds, 'nobody had any idea of how to run the airline's
finances. Everything was distorted by artificial exchange rates, arbitrary
pricing and providing sheltered employment for retired submarine commanders
and the like.'
The first steps to privatisation are now under way as Lot is
'commercialised' by conversion from an amorphous state-owned company into a
joint stock company with all shares held by the Polish treasury. This is the
classic first stage in Polish-style privatisation of big companies. The rest
depends on the speed with which Poland and its neighbours create the
potential traffic which would make the revamped airline an attractive
investment.

investment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IN THE foreign investment dance of the post-communist countries Poland feels
that it has been a wallflower. By the end of 1990, according to Mr Zbigniew
Piotrovsky, head of the Foreign Investment Agency, founded in 1988, only
Dollars 160m had been invested by foreign partners in joint ventures that
were in operation.
Yet things are looking up, since this represented a four-fold increase over
the level at the end of the previous year. Furthermore, in 1990 the FIA
handled 1,752 applications to establish joint ventures, more than twice as
many as in 1989. Among these investors are such famous western names as
Philips and Pilkingtons, but by far the most important source of investment
applications is Germany, with more than a third of the total in 1990.
Poland hopes for much more. The recently signed multilateral agreement to
lower Poland's official external debt by 50 per cent is bound to help.
Also likely to help is a revised Foreign Investment Law, now before
parliament. The new law makes four main changes to present legislation:
The need for permits from the FIA is now to be limited to a very few
sensitive areas;
The previous minimum entry requirement of Dollars 50,000 and 20 per cent of
the capital stock is to be abolished;
Tax incentives are to be modified. The automatic three-year tax holiday is
to be abolished. The new law will retain a form of tax holiday, but for
substantial investors, with a minimum equity requirement;
Automatic guarantees are to be provided against expropriation and
nationalisation and full repatriation of profits, capital gains and
dividends.
All this should help, as should determined attempts to bring foreign
investors into the rapidly accelerating privatisation programme. But the
most important conditions are successful stabilisation of the Polish economy
and liberal terms of association with the European Community. The battle for
both is now fully engaged. If Poland succeeds, it should soon cease to be a
wallflower.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (13): Iron finance minister drives on -
Profile: Leszek Balcerowicz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Polish programme of radical economic stabilisation and restructuring is
associated with the name of one man. That man is Mr Leszek Balcerowicz,
erstwhile academic economist, but since September 1989 executor of the
'Balcerowicz plan' in his capacity as deputy prime minister and minister of
finance. The more politically-minded may regret his rigour, but he himself
is determined to proceed.
Asked about his goal for inflation this year, Mr Balcerowicz agrees that
'nobody can be sure whether we can achieve 1 per cent a month or something
between 1 and 2 per cent. What's really important is for the rate of
inflation to drop and to stay at the lower rate permanently.
The original assumption for December to December inflation was about 32 per
cent. It may be a bit higher, though we hope not much higher.' But, as he
points out, 'this should be compared with annualised inflation of 2,000 per
cent in 1989 and of 250 per cent in 1990'.
Achieving that goal will be made no easier by the last jolt of price
adjustments, necessitated by a fivefold increase in the cost of imported
natural gas from the Soviet Union. The domestic price of natural gas was
raised by 80 per cent in January and still needs to be raised by another 120
per cent.
Asked about the timing of these increases, Mr Balcerowicz remarks that 'we
had assumed the election was to be in June or May. It turns out that the
elections are going to be in October and there is no time to wait. So the
decision has to be taken earlier'.
Naturally, this is not going to be popular, but 'if one wanted to minimise
inflation in the short term, one would have to give up price adjustments and
one would have to find sources of finance for gas and electricity.
So what helps to make tough decisions,' continues the Minister in words that
would delight Mrs Margaret Thatcher, 'is that there is no easy way out.'
Is the minister concerned about the loss of competitiveness as Polish wages
soar and the exchange rate remains fixed at 19,500 zlotys to the dollar? 'We
are not contemplating any radical devaluation,' he insists. 'Having said
that, it is quite normal that we are working on various concepts of exchange
rate determination, though not a radical devaluation. But our intention is
to use the exchange rate as an important stabiliser.'
Mr Balcerowicz is equally determined to retain the highly unpopular system
of wage control, according to which only 60 per cent of the inflation in a
given month can be passed into wages in the state sector. Equally, 'our
intention is not to have too great a budget deficit. This would probably
require painful adjustments of expenditure to lower than assumed revenues,'
which is made more difficult by the success already achieved in cutting
subsidies, from 15 per cent of gross domestic product in 1989, down to 5-6
per cent today.
With inflation rising above its trough of 1.8 per cent reached last August,
to monthly rates of 4 per cent or more since then, Mr Balcerowicz admits
that 'the results of the stabilisation turned out to be worse in the second
half of last year than we expected, for three reasons.
'The first was the oil price shock. It was a double shock for us, because
the Soviets started to increase the proportion of oil priced in dollars and
the dollar price also started to increase. The second was the election
campaign. A number of promises were made, including promises that if you
doubled wages, then production would double and the standard of living would
improve very quickly. I think this weakened the position of managers. The
third is that there may have been a relaxation of macroeconomic policies,
especially monetary policy.'
If the mistakes have made him more determined, Poland has certainly been
unfortunate, its present worry being the collapse in exports to the Soviet
Union. The earlier forecast was for 3 to 4 per cent GDP growth this year,
but 'if this tendency in trade with the Soviets continues we cannot hope for
that rate of growth,' admits the minister.
So, can the Government continue with its policies when enterprises are
hurting, unemployment is soaring and even the fates are conspiring against
it?
'So far as the government is concerned'' asserts Mr Balcerowicz, 'I think
there is a cohesion. I have not had any problem with the basic elements of
the economic strategy, contrary to some expectations. The difficulty is that
you cannot expect that everybody would understand the difficulties and
challenges of the economic situation. I am referring to the politicians. I
would hope that they would understand, but, of course, not everybody
understands why keeping wage controls is so crucial. But the people with
whom we are working have a full realisation of what it would mean to
sidetrack. It would be too dangerous not to continue.'

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (11): The giant leap to a capitalist system
 -Martin Wolf investigates the task of privatising some 8,000 substantial
state enterprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a truth almost universally acknowledged that market economies need
private owners. Markets without ownership are like a car without an engine:
fine for a child (or its bureaucratic equivalent) to play with, but unlikely
to get anyone anywhere.
The question is how to privatise an economy, 80 per cent of which is at
least notionally in state hands. When one recalls that Margaret Thatcher,
queen of western privatisers, managed to change the ownership of some two
dozen enterprises over 12 years, the scale of the task is clear. Poland has
to privatise some 8,000 substantial state enterprises  - 6,000 of which are
the responsibility of central government and 2,000 of local government.
Worse, their number is growing as enterprises are broken up, to
de-monopolise the economy.
In spite of the difficulties, the government is determined to proceed
rapidly. In the election campaign, Lech Walesa promised to distribute
capital to every Pole, but his emphasis on more rapid privatisation clashes
with his determination not to reward the old bosses, the nomenklatura. The
nomenklatura includes virtually all the old managerial class and much of the
new entrepreneurial class. Privatisation that includes the nomenklatura may
be politically unacceptable, but privatisation that excludes it looks
economically unworkable.
Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, deputy prime minister and minister of finance,
insists, however, that 'from a purely economic point of view, management
buy-outs would be a good solution. You would have concentrated ownership.
You would have insider ownership. This would certainly be much better than
to have employee-owned and controlled enterprises.'
This latter risk also concerns Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the recently appointed
minister for ownership change, whose job it is to accelerate privatisation.
Of privatisation of the larger enterprises, for example, he argues that 'if
there is no move towards transferable property rights, the result may be an
enormous historical experiment in employee shareholding. This is really
dangerous, since what we need is mobility, not increased job resistance.'
The danger is an almost inevitable by-product of the decision to pursue
reform as rapidly as possible. Speed makes for rough and ready solutions,
and in Polish circumstances the readiest, if the roughest, is to grant
ownership rights to workers who already consider they own their firms.
Like Caesar's Gaul, the privatisation programme is divided into three main
parts:
Classic privatisation, on the British model;
Privatisation by liquidation; and
Privatisation by voucher.
To these should be added the rent of public assets, which Mr Balcerowicz
calls 'invisible privatisation. It is this kind of privatisation that was
most advanced last year,' he says, 'which is why we have has such a change
in retail trade, in transportation and in other services.' About half of
retail trade, for example, is now in private hands and, in 1990, more than
58 per cent of the new private enterprises (around 300,000 out of 516,000)
were trade enterprises.*
The classic route is the sale of a company by way of offer to the public or
as a trade sale. Five companies have already been privatised in this way.
Two more are to be sold off in May, and five more are ready for sale this
year.
Starting in May, procedures will be simplified, with the sale of shares on a
first-come, first-served basis. The earlier ones were simply 'too
sophisticated and complex for Polish circumstances', argues Mr Lewandowski.
But the main hope, he feels, is for more trade sales, particularly to
foreigners, citing as important examples recent the purchases by Philips of
the Netherlands of Poland's largest lighting firm and by Beloit of the US of
Fampa, the largest producer of pulp and paper in central and eastern Europe.
The minister hopes for about 60 such sales this year.
The most successful method so far is 'privatisation by liquidation'. Despite
the name, this is not bankruptcy; it is a way of changing the legal status
of a state enterprise, generally the smaller ones, in order to sell it. The
process started only last December, but more than 100 companies have been
liquidated in this way so far, and the minister expects at least 500, and
perhaps as many as 900-1,000, in the year as a whole.
Such privatisations are initiated by the work-forces and managers of the
enterprise, the motives being two-fold: to escape paying dividends to the
ministry of finance, and to evade the current strict controls upon wages in
state enterprises. Ninety per cent of these privatisations end up as a form
of worker-management buy-out. While there is the possibility of either
outright sale or simple hire of the assets of the liquidated company, 90 per
cent of these arrangements involve inflation-indexed 'lease-purchase'
agreements with the treasury.
However popular this form of privatisation may have become, Mr Lewandowski
is deeply concerned about the economic and political dangers of 'creating
capitalism without capital. These are very weak financial entities, whose
owners are thinking of repaying debt, not investment; of wages, not
rationalisation. There is a danger that many of the enterprises will go
bankrupt, which would be a disaster for the whole image of privatisation.'
The solution is to let 'our emerging entrepreneurial class have a look in',
argues Mr Lewandowski. But he cannot force the workers to accept outside
investors. All he can do is convince them that this is in their interest,
even if the investor with the money is likely to have an unsavoury past, a
questionable present and an unpopular future.
Finally, there are vouchers, a scheme that Mr Lewandowski claims as his own.
He thinks, however, that Vaclav Klaus, Czechoslovakia's finance minister is
being unrealistic in his attempts to manage most of the Czechoslovak
transformation in this way. For Mr Lewandowski, vouchers are a 'political
umbrella over the more commercial methods of privatisation'. In particular,
they are a way of involving workers in large enterprises, via their right to
20 per cent of the shares at a discount.
The voucher alternative is immensely complex and, despite the minister's
pride of ownership in this idea, still under examination. A public
announcement is to be made in June.
If the government goes ahead, it will be in tranches, with 100 out of 500
large companies in the first slice. In the first round, only 30 per cent of
the shares in these companies are likely to be offered to the public, via
vouchers. Although the government has decided that the public would own
shares in 'Polish Privatisation Funds' that would, in turn, own shares in
the companies, the details of how to allocate companies to the funds or
vouchers to citizens have not yet been decided. The government is being
advised on this by, among others, the newly founded European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
After a slow start, with the basic legislation agreed only last July, Polish
privatisation is now accelerating, with the prime minister, Mr Jan Bielecki,
determined to privatise half of Poland's state-owned assets within three
years. With a central staff of just 150 people, the ministry of ownership
change is hopelessly overburdened. Fortunately, this is a collaborative
venture, with this ministry working with others on shared programmes. The
ministry of finance, for example, is responsible for the commercialisation
and privatisation of the banking and insurance sectors.
Nevertheless, the task remains huge, and the pitfalls plentiful. The
government is, for example, planning for legislation on restitution of
former owners. Fearing that this could be a bottleneck, it plans to limit
this process more than in other eastern European countries, although this is
a matter on which there is disagreement with the president.
Poland's choice is only between going full speed ahead, never mind the
torpedoes, or sinking where it is. There will be more worker involvement
than the economists would like, and more nomenklatura involvement than
politicians would prefer. There will be scandals and suspicion. But there
will also be private owners - and that is what it is all about.

'THE thrust of this agreement,' says the Polish government of the
association arrangement now under negotiation with the European Community,
'is to open Europe for Poland and Poland for Europe. It is therefore an
agreement of historical importance.'
So, indeed, it is. Correspondingly, the first and perhaps most fundamental
government demand has been that the agreement commit the EC to the principle
of Polish membership.
As a step towards that aim, but also to underpin its economic reforms,
Poland seeks a free trade area with the EC 'for essentially all products',
one that would ensure stability of market access for Polish exports (about
half of which already go to the EC) and would also enable Poland to maintain
the 'open import system that we now enjoy'. The latter is no trivial demand
since, at present, Poland's import regime is more liberal than that of the
EC.
Confronted with a political challenge of the first magnitude, the EC counts
ears of wheat and votes of farmers. In his statement to the EC of March 19,
1991, Mr Andrzej Olechowski, secretary of state at the Ministry for Foreign
Economic Co-operation, condemned the resulting proposals on trade, as 'a
highly unbalanced proposal.
'On one side, it asks Poland to commit itself to eliminate before the end of
the agreement all restrictions on imports from the EC, limit and discipline
the use of safeguard measures and strengthen protection afforded to
intellectual property. On the other side, it offers Poland removal of import
restrictions pertaining to about one half of its exports (since it excludes
most of agriculture, textiles and clothing, and steel) and the assurance of
GATT-consistent use of safeguards also covering only half of the products it
exports.
'There is no government in the world which would submit such a one-sided
agreement to its parliament for ratification,' concluded the Polish
negotiator.
In its response to the EC, the Polish government proposed the following:
Customs duties for all products to be removed at the latest by the end of
the agreement's second stage (after ten years), but the EC would consolidate
tariff preferences and remove duties for selected agricultural, textiles and
steel products upon initiation of the agreement, while Poland would remove
duties on all products that it does not produce;
Upon initiation of the agreement the EC would remove quantitative
restrictions for all products (so matching Poland), while Poland would
undertake not to introduce such restrictions on imports from the EC;
Gradual reduction of variable levies on agricultural imports from Poland and
gradual removal of minimum prices for agricultural and iron and steel
products, while Poland would undertake not to impose countervailing duties
on EC's officially dumped exports;
Adjustment of protection of intellectual property by Poland to EC standards;
and
Agreement on mutual liberalisation of public contracts.
How agonising it must be for the EC to confront a government that believes
in both the EC and in free trade] Shamed perhaps, EC foreign ministers did
decide on April 15 to go a little further towards meeting the demands of
Poland (and of Czechoslovakia and Hungary as well).
In particular, membership of the EC may now figure in the preamble to the
agreements as 'an ultimate, though not an automatic' goal. The EC has also
dropped its call for a review half-way through the 10-year period during
which trade barriers are to be phased out.
Eastern Europeans will probably be allowed to sell more fruit, vegetables,
pork, game, but not - heaven forbid - cereals, beef, lamb or dairy products,
which will continue to receive the full protection of the Common
Agricultural Policy.
Northern EC members also overruled Mediterranean objections to giving
eastern Europe a little more on textiles and steel. All textile tariffs are
to disappear over the 10-year transition period, while steel import duties
and quotas will go within five years. But the country most concerned to keep
out Polish coal was Germany, which insists upon a special regime.
In spite of these steps forward, the agreement is likely to remain
'asymmetric' - on the EC's normal mercantilist logic - in the EC's favour.
The EC's response is, it appears, to suggest that Poland increase its
tariffs.
No wonder the US is grumbling that eastern Europe will be persuaded to make
a general increase in its tariffs, followed by a selective reduction only
towards the EC.
While an agreement is almost certain to be reached this year, the question
remains what sort of an agreement it will be. The entry of Poland into
closer trading relations with the EC could make the latter more liberal or
the former more protectionist. Poland is in grave danger of losing this
battle, to the disadvantage of both sides.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (9): A country that is open to world trade
 -Poland is far too self-sufficient for its own good
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ITS response to Poland's attempt to reach a new agreement with the
European Community, an agreement on which Poland pins its political and its
economic future, Brussels has accepted the principle of asymmetry: that, at
least in the first phase, it should open its markets to imports from Poland
more than Poland to exports from the EC.
To its embarrassment, the EC has discovered that meeting the commitment
requires substantial liberalisation on its part. The reason is simple.
According to Mr Andrzej Olechowski, secretary of state in the Ministry of
Foreign Economic Relations, Poland has the most liberal trade policies in
Europe and among the most liberal in the world.
Driven by free-trading conviction and by the opportunities afforded by the
possession - at least in 1990 - of an undervalued exchange rate, the Polish
government has not only eliminated all quantitative restrictions, but
suspended most of its duties at the zero or 5 per cent level in the middle
of last year.
Tariffs on 57.9 per cent of the country's tariff-lines are now zero, while
tariffs on only 36.5 per cent of Poland's tariff-lines are more than 10 per
cent. Combined with the move to exchange rate convertibility on current
account in January 1990, the Polish market lies open to world trade.
EC negotiators find Poland's liberalism not merely embarrassing, but naive.
They would prefer Poland to be more protectionist. Yet Poland's liberalism
on trade makes excellent sense: it introduces competition into a largely
uncompetitive domestic economy; it enhances choice and so improves
incentives; and, since a tax on imports is simultaneously a tax on exports,
it promotes opening of the economy.
With total exports only about 15 per cent of gross national product in 1990,
Poland is far too self-sufficient for its own economic good. The dependence
on trade is well below that in more populous - and richer - countries, such
as France (where it is 22 per cent), not to mention western Germany (33 per
cent) or the Netherlands (55 per cent). Poland's ratios of trade to gross
national product probably need to double. The combination of liberal trade
with a competitive exchange rate will help to bring this about.
In 1990 this combination - powerfully assisted by the deep recession (as
shown in the 12 per cent decline in real gross domestic product between 1989
and 1990) produced an unexpectedly good trade performance.
In convertible currencies, Poland moved from a tiny surplus of Dollars 100m
in 1989 to one of Dollars 2.2bn in 1990 and achieved a current account
surplus in convertible currencies of Dollars 700m.
A surplus would hardly be a sensible objective for a poor country like
Poland, least of all if it were the result of a steep decline in imports.
Fortunately, that is not what happened.
The dollar value of merchandise exports in convertible currencies (on a
balance of payments basis) rose by 31 per cent between 1989 and 1990; in
constant prices they rose by 32 per cent. Meanwhile, the dollar value of
merchandise imports in convertible currencies rose by 3 per cent; in
constant prices such imports fell by only 4 per cent. Happily, exports were
the key to Polish trade performance.
The convertible currency trade balance has not remained positive. Monthly
trade balance in convertible currencies turned negative in November 1990,
while in the first quarter of 1991 Poland ran a convertible currency
merchandise trade deficit of just under Dollars 400m (on a customs cleared
basis).
This move into deficit is in significant part explained by the need to pay
for Soviet oil at world prices and in dollars, from the beginning of 1991.
Overall export performance has remained strong: in January 1991 merchandise
exports in dollars were 59 per cent higher than in January 1990.
None the less, export performance must be threatened by the decline in
Poland's competitiveness. The exchange rate has remained fixed at 19,500
zlotys to the dollar since January 1990, even though average monthly wages
in the five basic industrial sectors of the state economy rose by 143 per
cent between January 1990 and January 1991. Consequently, from their peak of
more than 50 per cent of sales at the end of 1989, profits in state
enterprises fell to below 20 per cent at the end of 1990. The decline in
profitability explains both why export performance is endangered and calls
for protection are increasing.
For the Polish government a generous agreement with the EC is one of the
most important ways of resisting growing protectionist pressures at home.
The government wants to intensify the squeeze on state enterprises and
wishes to avoid a devaluation; but it finds it increasingly difficult to
persist when the EC puts quantitative restrictions on the goods in which
Poland has a competitive advantage.
At present, complains Mr Dariusz Ledworoski, the minister of foreign
economic relations, more than half of Poland's exports to the EC consist of
agricultural commodities, textiles and clothing, and steel, all of which are
subject to restrictions. The asymmetry, as Poland rightly complains, are all
in the EC's favour. How can Poland resist protectionist pressures from its
farmers if the EC will not open its markets? Why should it try to resist
those pressures seems, unfortunately, to be the EC's crass reply.
Helping to keep Poland itself protection-free is just one reason for Poland
to obtain as liberal an agreement with the EC as is possible. Poland also
needs markets, particularly since trade with the Soviet Union and the
post-communist countries of eastern Europe has collapsed. The dollar
equivalent of exports to the eastern countries had already fallen by a third
between 1988 and 1990 and the region's share in Poland's exports had
declined from 41 to 25 per cent. It is now falling further.
Following the shift to hard currency payment, Poland paid about Dollars 250m
on imports from the Soviet Union (largely oil) in the first two months of
1991, but received a mere Dollars 20m from its exports to that troubled
giant, even though the value of the goods shipped was considerably greater.
Yet the expectation only last December was that trade with the Soviet Union
would be about Dollars 1.5bn each way. Two years ago the Soviet Union took
about 30 per cent of Poland's exports. Suddenly, it is taking virtually
none, a collapse that threatens as many as 1m jobs.
The disaster in trade with the Soviet Union reinforces the shift in the
direction of Poland's trade that was already under way. But it also makes
changes in western policy towards Poland's exports still more urgent than
they were a few months ago. Looking at the collapse to the east and the
obstacles to the west, Mr Ledworoski argues that 'if we cannot restructure
our industry through exports, we allow it to be murdered'. The Polish
government argues, therefore, that at the least Poland needs the EC to treat
its imports from Poland no less generously than Poland now treats its
imports from the EC.

Profile: Stan Tyminski
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE graffiti, stencilled on a Poznan wall in Russian reads: 'Warning. Stan
Tyminski' and the date, December 9. It was a thinly veiled warning to Polish
voters that a vote for the previously unknown Polish-Canadian businessman in
the second round of the presidential elections last year was a vote for dark
and mysterious forces with secret-service connections.
The graffiti reflects the classic conspiracy theory response to Mr
Tyminski's shock defeat of former Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in the
November first round. But most of the Poles, around 23 per cent of the
electorate, who voted for him in the first round, stuck by him in the
second, while those from the Mazowiecki camp, who earlier bitterly opposed
Mr Walesa, were shocked into rallying round to ensure a 77 per cent support
for the Walesa presidency.
The polarisation of Polish politics around Mr Walesa, the former shipyard
electrician who sprang to national and then global fame almost overnight as
Solidarity leader during the Gdansk shipyard strike in August 1980, and Mr
Tyminski, who turned up, completely unknown, three months before elections
and defeated the prime minister, reflects the fluid, and sometimes bizarre
side of post-communist Polish politics.
Yet it is difficult, on acquaintance, to imagine that Mr Tyminski has a
long-term future as a significant player in Polish politics. It is even more
difficult to see him as a sinister character, a potential tyrant or populist
rabble-rouser if times got really hard again.
Perhaps Poland has been lucky in finding such an apparently inoffensive
repository for the fears, frustrations and hopes of millions of ordinary
Poles. Perhaps, to put it differently, Mr Walesa is right in claiming credit
for having flushed out such previously unsuspected depths of resentment in
the Polish electorate at such an early stage, before someone more sinister
appeared to challenge the basis of Poland's restored but fledgling
democracy.
Greeting visitors in the small garden of his mother's modest, Swiss-style
chalet in the outer suburbs of Warsaw, Mr Tyminski appeared smaller and
tubbier than his televised election presence. He smokes and smiles nervously
and is not an easy man to pin down on what he believes and what kind of
future he foresees for Poland.
Like Mr Walesa, he has a touching faith in computers. Unlike Mr Walesa he
actually knows something about them, having built up a small but modestly
profitable electronics parts factory in Canada.
Describing himself as a 'Pole and patriot', Mr Tyminski is now busy building
up a new party, called Party X, which will contest the parliamentary
elections expected in October. Thus far, he says, it has only 1,000 members
and Dollars 1,000 in the bank 'but we'll have from 50,000 to 100,000 members
in six months,' he predicts. And the programme? 'It's all here,' he says,
profferring a pamphlet containing a Polish translation of the 1773
Declaration of American Independence.
All here? 'Yes. Like the Americans we're fighting the red coats. All those
who used to be subservient to the communists.' But his enemies are not only
the communists, who his opponents believe are actually secretly supporting
him, but also individuals such as the US millionaire Mr George Soros, he
says.
He accuses Mr Soros 'whose influence goes from Russia through Poland to
China' of financing the Sachs-Lipton plan, drawn up by economists Jeffrey
Sachs and David Lipton, which is the basis of 'the Balcerowicz plan for free
market domination'.
'I'd like to see a Polish plan in action, compatible with the needs of the
people', he adds in words which to some ears carry the veiled tones of
foreign interference, and deeper undertones of old-style Jewish conspiracy
theory.
He denies any anti-Semitism but proffers an English translation of Hitler's
Mein Kampf as an example of the books sent to him by supporters 'but which I
don't have time to read'.
Much of the 43-year-old Toronto-based businessman's support comes from
younger Poles who grew up during martial law and were too young to
participate in the euphoric rise of Solidarity a decade ago which gave
legitimacy to the present generation of Polish politicians. Often living in
small towns and depressed industrial areas they want a quick, painless way
out of Poland's deep and painful economic trough.
For such people Mr Tyminski offers opposition to the government's wage
restraint - 'wage controls are very ugly with 300 per cent inflation', he
says. 'The government should have stopped printing money and making
unfavourable trade deals with the Russians. They should open the books of
state enterprises and publish a profit and loss account for each one.'
He promises 'my party will create the conditions for growth. We'll take an
inventory of state assets, change the accounting laws, abolish the popiwek
wages tax and change the tax system. Everyone will pay 50 per cent of his
income in tax, but will earn much more money. Poles think 50-50 is fair,' he
says.
Few, if any, of his ideas, stand up to conventional economic analysis. But
they sound good enough to millions of Poles for whom the rapid transition
from rags to riches, personified by Mr Tyminski's own modest fortune and
exotic past, is infinitely more appealing than the hard grind promised by
the new post-communist establishment. For Stan Tyminski read Walter Mitty.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (7): Shaping up for the first free,
multi-party elections - Christopher Bobinski and Anthony Robinson examine
the emerging post-communist political geography
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI and ANTHONY ROBINSON

<TEXT>
BY ONE of those ironies of fate Poland, which was the first former Warsaw
Pact country to break away from communist rule, is now the last to hold
free, multi-party elections. Even Albanians have been to the polls, while
post-communist Poland's political geography will become clear only after
elections this autumn.
This means that parliament is still dominated by deputies from the old
communist establishment who were guaranteed a two-thirds majority in the
lower house by the so-called 'round table agreement' between the Solidarity
movement and the Communist party two years ago.
Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the first non-communist prime minister, decided to
keep this agreement intact and patriotically concentrated on solving
Poland's pressing economic and other problems rather than dissolve
parliament and call new elections. But he fell foul of the presidential
ambitions of Mr Lech Walesa and mounting economic difficulties as his
government pushed ahead with a tough IMF-backed economic stabilisation plan
named after Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the finance minister.
So instead of parliamentary elections Poland held presidential elections
last November and December at the insistence of Mr Walesa, Solidarity's
historic leader. After an unexpectedly tough challenge from Mr Stan
Tyminski, a previously unknown Polish-Canadian businessman, Mr Walesa won 77
per cent of the vote in the second round to become Poland's first elected
president. He inherited the powers of his communist predecessor, General
Wojciech Jaruzelski.
Mr Mazowiecki's government resigned and the new president virtually
hand-picked a new government. It is led by Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, a
former Solidarity underground activist and 'liberal' free marketeer from
Gdansk, but retains Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz from the old
government. His IMF-backed economic stabilisation plan, while fiercely
criticised during the presidential election campaign, is recognised as a key
element in Poland's international credibility.
The outcome of this autumn's elections will hinge largely on the eventual
shape of the electoral law now being debated in parliament. Behind an
apparently arcane debate on the relative merits of proportional or
first-past-the-post voting systems lie important political considerations
affecting the future division of powers between the presidency and the
parliament.
Mr Walesa makes no secret of his admiration for Poland's pre-war strongman,
Marshall Jozef Pilsudski, or his interest in the presidential powers once
wielded by General Charles de Gaulle. But the exact definition of
presidential powers remains to be finalised by the next parliament.
Proportional representation alone could lead to the proliferation of small
parties which would keep parliament relatively weak. But some of Mr Walesa's
closest advisers, such as Mr Jaroslaw Kaczynski, now argue that it would be
better to have a few large parties and fear that a UK-style
first-past-the-post system could also favour candidates like Mr Tyminski, in
multi-candidate elections. A rather complex compromise with greater emphasis
on the proportional aspect is now being considered.
The elections will see a contest between the various political groups and
parties which over the past 18 months have evolved out of the former
Solidarity movement.
Much divides the parties. But they share a fear of Mr Tyminski, who won a
quarter of the vote in the first round of the presidential elections,
beating Mr Mazowiecki, the then prime minister and Mr Walesa's main rival,
into third place.
'His appeal is so primitive that people of average intelligence only shrug
their shoulders in disbelief that anyone can take him seriously, but it
brings in votes,' says Mr Kaczynski, who, as well as being the head of Mr
Walesa's presidential office is also the leader of the Centre Agreement,
which hopes to develop into a right of centre Christian Democratic party
similar to West Germany's Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
Mr Tyminski's mixture of nationalism, nostalgia for the old communist-style
welfare net and promise of capitalist enrichment struck a sympathetic cord
with many threatened by unemployment and falling incomes. He is now busily
organising a new party called Party X, which opponents say is staffed by
shady characters from the old regime. He will not be able to stand for
parliament himself as the new electoral law includes a five-year residential
requirement for candidates.
The political spectrum aside from the X party is rich and varied and no
party can call President Walesa its own. Indeed, he stresses that he wants
to play an independent role above the political arena.
The old ruling communist party disbanded itself after its election debacle
in June 1989. But its post-communist successor, the Social Democrat (SdRP)
party, claims a 60,000 membership and hopes to win between 10 and 15 per
cent of the vote. It is internally divided, however, between a social
democratic fraction, led by Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, and a majority of
nostalgics led by Mr Leszek Miller who hanker after a re-establishment of
the party's former dominance.
The Solidarity trade union, Mr Walesa's old power base and the core of
opposition to the communists for a decade, is also looking for a new, albeit
more modest, political role and continues to feel that it is the ultimate
guardian of the process of change in the country.
The battle for the crucial centre ground is shaping up between Mr
Kaczynski's Centre Agreement and the ROAD group, which includes former
Solidarity activists such as Mr Adam Michnik and Mr Jacek Kuron, who backed
Mr Mazowiecki against Mr Walesa and who now support his Democratic Union,
the former premier's attempt to re-establish a presence in the next
parliament.
Away to the right are the nationalist groups, the largest of which is the
National Christian Union (ZChN), which is most prominent in support of the
Catholic church's campaign to abolish abortion. The Catholic church
continues as a political force even though it has been damaged a little by
its drive to reintroduce religion into schools and opposition to Poland's
liberal abortion laws. The church wants to ensure that the Christian
Democratic strain of Solidarity retains a powerful role.
Meanwhile, recent weeks have seen renewed attempts to forge a coalition of
rural parties angry at the government's farming policies. A united farm vote
could win some 20 per cent of the seats, block agricultural reform policies
and demand protection from foreign competition.
The political picture could change substantially over the next few months,
however, should President Walesa decide that the threat from Mr Tyminski is
strong enough to construct a purely 'presidential' party. Then many
political groups would coalesce around the Belvedere Palace.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (6): Surviving those slings and arrows -
Profile: Bank Handlowy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ONCE upon a time, in an entirely different world
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
in 1870, to be precise - Bank Handlowy was established as the first
joint-stock bank in Poland.
Since then it has undergone the same vicissitudes as the rest of Poland:
wars, depression, post-war nationalisation and now adjustment to the return
of a market economy.
But under its young US-trained president, Mr Cezary Stypulkowski, who was
catapulted into office only two months ago, Bank Handlowy seems to have a
good chance of being one of the survivors in what is now a decidedly shaky
domestic banking industry.
Before the First World War Bank Handlowy was recognised as a significant
European bank. It managed to survive the two wars and the chaos in between,
only to succumb to the embrace of the Polish communist state.
In its new guise as a state-owned joint stock company it received, in 1964,
a monopoly over all foreign banking operations connected with the export and
import of all goods and services. This function it discharged, profitably,
thereafter.
Now it is all change again. In 1988 the responsibilities of the National
Bank of Poland were divided up among new commercial banks. By the middle of
last year licences had been granted for the establishment of more than 50
commercial banks. Fifteen banks have been granted foreign exchange licences
and a new Export Development Bank has been set up. The Bank PKO SA (SA being
the Polish equivalent of plc), which is a foreign currency savings bank, is
also a competitor to Bank Handlowy. What these changes mean to the bank is
that its monopoly has been broken, but that it is also in quite a strong
position to exploit the many new opportunities.
Notwithstanding the competition, Bank Handlowy still retains an
overwhelmingly strong base in foreign trade. In 1990, by then a full member
of the SWIFT network, the Bank financed 90 per cent of Poland's exports and
more than 70 per cent of imports in 1990. Mr Stypulkowski recognises that
this share must fall, even though it would become a smaller share of what
should be a far larger market. Nevertheless, the bank's significance to
Poland is likely to endure for many years. As the president drily remarks,
'a bank through which almost 90 per cent of the balance of payments passes
has a certain importance to the government'.
In meeting the challenge to its old line of business, the bank has two
important advantages: experience and contacts. It has a relatively highly
trained staff of 2,500, 1,700 of whom are located in a vast modern tower
block in Warsaw; a branch in London; a number of representative offices and
affiliates abroad; and a network of 289 correspondent relationships. But the
business has already changed dramatically as the number of clients, Polish
firms engaged in foreign trade, has grown from 200 to 2,000. It will grow
further. Largely for this reason, the Bank has launched a substantial
expansion of its domestic branch network, increasing their number from seven
to 20.
The bank also sees opportunities in new areas, including private banking for
the new Polish rich, advisory services; and participation in other financial
institutions, either domestic ones or joint ventures with foreign capital.
Its exceptionally good foreign contacts give it a head start in joint
ventures.
What the bank lacks is a deposit base, something that could be remedied by a
merger with one of the domestic commercial banks. Mr Stypulkowski finds the
idea attractive, but is biding his time. Bank Handlowy has the advantage of
a lucrative banking niche and no exposure to the huge quantities of poor
domestic assets that weigh on the other state commercial banks. The trick
may not be finding a bank with which to merge, but picking the right deal
and the right time, to ensure that any merged bank does not fall over the
precipice into bankruptcy.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (5): Deal yet to be reached with Soviet
Union
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SITUATION vis-a-vis the Soviet Union is complex in different ways.
At present, Poland owes the Soviet Union 4.7bn transferable roubles and
Dollars 1.7-1.8bn in convertible currency, while the Soviet Union owes
Poland 7.7bn in transferable roubles and Dollars 300m in convertible
currency clearing balances (up to the end of the first quarter of 1991).
Poland argues that its net claims of 3bn transferable roubles should more
than offset its net debt of Dollars 1.4-1.5bn.
If recent precedents with Hungary and Czechoslovakia were followed, Poland
would finish up as a substantial creditor. But agreement has yet to be
reached.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (4): Relief at last from a poisonous legacy
 -Poland's debt was a communist attempt to borrow their way out of
unpopularity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE HOPE that this agreement will be once and for all', since 'the essence
of this agreement is the fact that we will now be able to service the
contractual debt.'
This is how Mr Janusz Sawicki, deputy minister of finance and Poland's chief
debt negotiator, describes the result of his labours: an unprecedented
multilateral deal with the Paris Club of 17 official creditors for 50 per
cent reduction of Poland's official hard-currency debt, a deal reached after
prolonged discussion in March 1991 and ratified on April 19.
That ratification followed directly on the heels of agreement with the
International Monetary Fund to a three-year programme that will obtain total
support of roughly Dollars 1.6bn.
Mr Sawicki has reason to feel pleased with his labours, since Poland's
Dollars 45bn external debt was a legacy quite as poisonous as the ruined
environment bequeathed by the present government's communist predecessor.
That debt was created by the communist government's attempt to borrow its
way out of domestic unpopularity during the 1970s. By 1981, external
hard-currency debt had reached Dollars 25.5bn.
Thereafter, the debt grew virtually entirely through the accrual of unpaid
interest, to reach some Dollars 45bn today - roughly Dollars 1,100 per head,
two-thirds of gross national product and four-and-a-half times the value of
1990 exports in convertible currencies. The latter ratio is, according to
the World Bank's World Debt Tables 1990-91, also about 50 per cent higher
than that for the average of middle-income highly-indebted countries.
It is no wonder that the two post-communist governments, have sought
agreement with their creditors on a very substantial programme of debt
reduction.
In practice, Poland has not been servicing its official debts since 1981,
which is why they have grown to Dollars 33bn. Because Poland's debt to
commercial banks was serviced until November 1989, this has become
relatively smaller during the 1980s and is now a little under Dollars 11bn,
but it too is no longer being serviced.
Naturally, a government wishing to integrate the Polish economy as quickly
and as completely into the world market economy, wishes to reach an amicable
agreement with its creditors and subsequently fulfil its contractual
obligations. Only thus does it have any hope of attracting the inward
investment and finance that will be needed.
But, having decided that debt relief is essential, it wishes to reach
agreement on the most favourable possible terms. If the terms are perceived
as being too onerous, the country may still fail to obtain the inward
investment it seeks.
The government's demand was for debt reduction of 80 per cent. In the event,
its creditors have granted multilateral agreement to a 50 per cent reduction
in the net present value of the official debt. Within that total, creditors
have a choice among alternatives. They can choose between:
Writing off a part of Poland's debt;
Accepting lower interest payments, while leaving the debt's face value
unchanged; or
Allowing a reduction of interest payments along with some roll-up of
interest into capital.
The debt relief is to be in two stages. The first stage, accounting for
about 30 per cent of the reduction in net present value, is to cover the
next three years and would involve a cut of 70-80 per cent in Polish
payments. In this way the government has obtained the reduction it sought
during the pivotal early years, with payments likely to average Dollars 600m
(the precise figures depending here and throughout on exchange-rate
movements against the dollar).
Then, in the fourth year, the interest bill would rise, with concessions on
the debt service bill likely to average 30-40 per cent. But the precise
details of the debt service due from 1994 would depend on which options are
chosen, and how big the agreed reductions in the net present value of the
debt turn out to be.
greater the relief on debt-service, the bigger the reduction in annual
payments, but the larger the sum that needs to be found for the ultimate
repayment. The reverse is true for reduction in the debt stock outstanding.
According to Mr Sawicki, the government will seek packages that are overall
compatible with Poland's expected annual cash flow.
In addition, the Polish government regards the 50 per cent reduction as
merely a minimum. There is the possibility of voluntary swaps of 10 per cent
of the debt into zlotys for domestic expenditures, notably on the
environment. But it also hopes that some governments will go further. The
US, for example, has already agreed to cut Poland's debt by 70 per cent, but
this has irritated some of its partners, notably France, and is unlikely to
prove a precedent for many other creditors.
French irritation is not unique. The entire agreement does, in fact, bear
witness to the power of persuasion of the US. Justifying this
unprecedentedly generous agreement (which many fear will become a precedent
all too soon), Mr David Mulford, US Treasury under-secretary for
international affairs, has claimed that Poland and Egypt are 'unique
politically and economically'.
Mr Mulford told the FT on March 18 that three principles underpinned the
arrangement: Poland needed a deep cancellation on its debt; only a consensus
among foreign governments in the Paris Club could achieve this; and the deal
was made conditional on Poland's economic performance under an economic
programme with the International Monetary Fund. But the US also has a large
Polish ethnic community, and is owed less than 10 per cent of Poland's
official debt.
Other creditors (not to mention other debtors) remain unhappy. Japanese
finance ministry officials, for example, have asserted that the Dollars 500m
loan promised to Poland by prime minister Toshiki Kaifu has been blocked,
following Poland's unwelcome deal with the Paris Club.
Whatever the difficulties still to come in the bilateral negotiations, the
agreement with the Paris Club is an enormous step toward resolution of
Poland's debt problems. What remain are the commercial banks and the Soviet
Union.
Asked what he expects of the commercial banks, Mr Sawicki swiftly replies:
'To be reasonable. We have never had a reasonable word from the banks. We
have not had an opportunity to negotiate with the banks. They say that they
first want money up front to clear up past due interest of about Dollars
1bn.'
The minister insists that the banks must accept a deal at least as generous
as that agreed with the Paris Club, which is already better than the market
value of the debt (about 30 per cent of face value, up from 18 per cent,
because of the Paris Club deal). In fact, 'in the past we treated banks
better than the governments, because we paid all interest due until the
November 1989, and because of that we would even expect that they will go
further.'
What is out of the question, insists Mr Sawicki, is that the banks would
benefit from the Paris Club agreement to get all they are owed. 'They can
get as tough as they want, but in that case they will get nothing.'
Much remains to be done, above all the bilateral negotiations with the Paris
Club creditors and the negotiations with the commercial banks, but much has
already been accomplished. There seems to be a good chance that Poland will
soon agree to debt service of about Dollars 1bn a year over the next three
years, and a reduction in the net present value of its total debt of 50 per
cent or more.
This will not end its difficulties. Indeed, it will have to pay
contractually-agreed debt service for the first time for a decade. But the
proposed levels of debt service are payable, provided the country sticks to
its stabilisation and reform programme. With the Paris Club agreement, the
plan to integrate Poland into the world economy has at least reached the end
of its beginning.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (2): The search for stability - Martin Wolf
discusses the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF

<TEXT>
POLAND has not been lucky. The crisis in the Gulf, the collapse of exports
to the Soviet Union and last year's presidential election have conspired to
blow the programme off course. But if the crew can sail through the storm
for another year or so, they should find themselves, if not in port, at
least in calmer seas.
If unlucky, Poles have been determined. They can also feel proud of what has
been achieved. There has, for example, been a dramatic growth in the private
sector. Outside agriculture, always largely in private hands, the private
sector's share of employment is estimated to have risen from 7 per cent in
1988 to 16 per cent in 1990 and its share in industrial output to have grown
from 3.9 to 11 per cent. Industrial output fell by 23 per cent in 1990, but
the output of the private sector is thought to have risen by 8 per cent, and
that of private sector retailing four-and-a-half times1.
Subsidies to production and consumption have been reduced from over half the
budget and about 15 per cent of gross domestic product in 1989, to 15 per
cent of the budget and about 5 per cent of GDP this year. Trade policy has
been comprehensively liberalised. According to Leszek Balcerowicz, deputy
prime minister and minister of finance, the only important price adjustments
to come are for natural gas, the price of which needs to rise by some 120
per cent, and electricity, the price of which needs to double.
These reforms provide essential support to the now accelerating programmes
of privatisation and restructuring. As Paul Hare and Gordon Hughes point
out, under distorted domestic prices 'an evaluation of the profitability of
firms or the branches in which they operate is likely to yield very
misleading results'2. Fortunately, this risk has been greatly reduced by the
speed with which the price structure has been reformed and liberalised.
Price and trade liberalisation have also transformed the market place. After
the perennial shortages and sloppy habits of the ancien regime, enterprises
are being forced to compete and workers to work. Food is in surplus. Shops
are full, even if with goods that many cannot yet afford.
Finally, last year's combination of a highly competitive exchange rate with
a deep industrial recession transformed Poland's external position. In 1990
Poland achieved a 31 per cent increase in the dolexports in convertible
currencies and a merchandise trade surplus of Dollars 2.2bn. These will help
Poland to cope with the higher prices of its oil imports from the Soviet
Union and the virtual disappearance of exports to that collapsing giant,
both of which hit in early 1991.
When one remembers that the reforms began in earnest only 16 months ago,
these are startling changes. But they must be set in the context of the
difficulties created by the tough, but essential, stabilisation programme
initiated in January 1990.
The fundamental elements of any stabilisation programme - a balanced budget
and a tight monetary policy - have been achieved. In fact, with the budget
in surplus throughout 1990 (though the surplus started to decline towards
the end of the year), the fiscal performance, was considerably tighter than
agreed with the International Monetary Fund. Poland also achieved tighter
control over credit than had been expected.
The government regards the exchange rate as a discipline and a stabiliser,
even though it does not view the present rate as one to be defended to the
death. Since this represents a potentially destabilising ambiguity, a more
clearly formulated exchange rate policy would be helpful. But holding the
exchange rate at 9,500 zlotys to the dollar has made an important
contribution to stabilisation, even if the real test is yet to come.
Mr Balcerowicz and his team have proved, notably in the first half of 1990,
to be Stakhanovites of economic stabilisation. Their efforts have not been
fruitless: the increase in consumer prices was running at an annualised rate
of 3,900 per cent over the last quarter of 1989; inflation then fell to 249
per cent between December 1989 and December 1990; and, if the finance
ministry's hopes are realised, should be below 40 per cent between December
1990 and December 1991.
With inflation falling, real holdings of zlotys doubled during 1990, while
those in foreign currency accounts fell by two thirds. This was sensible
behaviour. Given the high nominal interest rates in zloty saving accounts
and the fixed rate of exchange, an investment in zlotys must have been among
the best in the world.
So much has gone right. But two things have gone wrong:
The immediate decline in output and real incomes was far deeper than
expected; and
Inflation has not been brought under control as completely as had been
hoped.
In January 1990, the first month of the stabilisation programme, output in
state-owned industry fell by 32 per cent and was still 24 per cent below the
level of a year earlier in December. Puzzlingly, there were virtually no
bankruptcies (greatly to the government's surprise), profit margins remained
high (at around 20 per cent of sales) and employment changed relatively
little.
nomenon, suggests Mark Shaffer of the Centre for Economic Performance at the
London School of Economics, is that these enterprises are run as
worker-managed firms, with the principal objective of maintaining
employment, rather than output or real wages3. Furthermore, the workers who
control them assume that demand is unaffected by price.
It is partly because of the pricing behaviour of the enterprises that
inflation has remained quite high. After a trough of 1.8 per cent in August
1990, inflation has been running at 4-5 per cent a month, except for January
1991, when another burst of relative price adjustments increased prices by
12.7 per cent. The finance ministry hopes that inflation will be down to 1
per cent a month in the near future. But Mr Balcerowicz acknowledges that
forthcoming adjustments to prices of natural gas and electricity, which he
believes will be the last such corrections, will themselves raise the index
by 3-5 per cent.
The finance minister blames the resurgence of inflation in the second half
of last year on three developments:
The double oil price shock caused by the Gulf crisis and the move to world
prices for Soviet oil;
The presidential election campaign, with its populist tone and consequent
effects on wage behaviour; and
A premature relaxation of macroeconomic, above all monetary, policy.
The prime minister and the deputy prime minister are now determined to
maintain the tough monetary policy. Both welcome the positive real interest
rates - created by nominal interest rates, even on high quality credit, of
as much as 68 per cent a year - that are being enforced by Mr Grzegorz
Wojtovicz, the new president of the National Bank of Poland. Even Lech
Walesa seems to be prepared to live with the policy. But pressure for
relaxation is building up, within the government and outside.
Among the sources of that pressure are the effects on competitiveness of a
constant nominal exchange rate, though nominal wages in state enterprises
have risen by almost 150 per cent; the severe financial difficulties of some
state enterprises; the probability, following the collapse in demand from
the Soviet Union this year, that the 12 per cent decline in real GDP last
year will be followed by stagnation this year, not to mention the loss of
the market for important parts of industry; the protests of farmers; the
rise in unemployment, probably to 2m by the end of the year; and the
complaints about the fiscal controls that limit wage increases in the state
sector to 60 per cent of the increase in consumer prices.
As if that were not enough, there is a parliamentary election coming up in
October. But most of those in the government believe that monetary
relaxation creates inflation rather than expansion. Few seem likely to buy
the view of Jerzy Eysmont, head of the central planning office and a
prominent member of Centre Agreement, that it would be possible to live with
inflation as high as 100 per cent this year. They recognise that no market
economy can thrive under such rates of inflation and that Poland may never
have as good a chance to achieve stability again.
The government's commitment is revealed and underpinned by April's agreement
with the IMF, which offers Poland some Dollars 1.6bn over three years. The
government's letter of intent commits it to:
Limit its new foreign borrowing this year to Dollars 1.5bn;
Keep the exchange rate 'as one of the main points of' the anti-inflation
strategy;
Restrict growth of the domestic money supply to 43 per cent this year, as
against a 36 per cent forecast rate of inflation;
Limit the budget deficit to 0.5 per cent of GDP.
The question is whether the Polish people can be persuaded to accept, if not
like, this rigour. One hopes so, for they do have one consolation. Large
declines in real income have occurred in the Soviet Union and in all the
post-communist countries. Yet in none of them has that decline been
associated with the creation of a basis for subsequent expansion to the
extent that it has in Poland.
With the agreement on a 50 per cent reduction in official debt also achieved
and hope of a favourable agreement with the European Community, Poland has
good prospects for successful market-led growth. But first it must bring
inflation down to no more than 1 per cent a month, and keep it there. This
can be done; it can be done this year; but it may never be done if the
government yields to the pressures now upon it.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (1): A favourable moment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE euphoria of regained liberty has been replaced by sober recognition of
the difficulties that lie ahead. But the Poland which is now busy building a
market economy and pluralistic democracy has a vitality about it which bodes
well for the future.
Poland has had fresh starts - and tragic disappointments-before. It is one
of Europe's historic nations -and wears that history like an old, familiar
coat. When times are hard, or when fate opens up new perspectives, Poles
tend to dig into its pockets for solace or instruction.
The liberal constitution proclaimed on May 3, 1791 by Stanislaus Augustus,
King of Poland 'by the grace of God and will of the Nation', was one of
those glorious attempted fresh starts. The memory of its liberties sustained
the nation through the dark years when the state itself was wiped from the
map of Europe.
By happy quirk of fate the 200th anniversary of that constitution is now
being celebrated by a new Poland, one which is drawing up a post-communist
constitution under conditions similar to those described in the preamble of
1791.
Then, as now, the constitution was put together by men 'convinced by a long
train of defects in our government, and willing to profit by the present
circumstances of Europe, and by the favourable moment which has restored us
to ourselves, free from the disgraceful shackles of foreign influence'.
Alas, the favourable moment of 1791 evaporated fast. Four years later the
'enlightened' despots of Austria, Prussia and Russia dismembered the country
and apportioned the pieces among themselves.
Two centuries later the disintegration of the Soviet empire, and the
reunification of a Germany firmly anchored in the European Community and
Nato, have created another 'favourable moment'. The challenge is to remedy
the defects of the previous system - and consolidate Polish sovereignty and
prosperity while the going is good.
The urgency of the challenge appears to be widely understood.
Poland, with nearly 40m inhabitants, is the most populous of the six Warsaw
Pact countries which regained their independence in 1989. It also fought the
hardest for it.
The cross erected at Solidarity's insistence in Poznan in 1981, just before
martial law was imposed, symbolises that struggle. It commemorates the
worker riots of 1956, which marked the beginning of the end of communist
rule in Poland. Inscribed 'For freedom, bread and law' it carries the dates
1968, 1970, 1976 and 1980 - all years of rebellion, culminating in the rise
of Solidarity.,
It does not, of course, record subsequent events such as the declaration of
martial law in 1981 - or formation of the first non-communist government led
by Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki in September 1989. But the monument built on Red
Army Boulevard is now on St Martin's Street, the old pre-war name.
The fact that Poland struggled so hard in the past could be its salvation in
the future. Few have illusions that creating a market economy with a fast
growing middle class to form the underlying basis for a stable democracy
will be either quick or easy.
Yet, creation of a middle class is the specific aim of the new government
which, like its predecessor, is busy abolishing the economic and social
distortions of 45 years.
The IMF-backed economic stabilisation plan introduced by Mr Leszek
Balcerowicz, the finance minister, in January 1990 has already abolished
most consumer and producer subsidies and made the zloty internally
convertible.
The government is finalising a large-scale privatisation plan, through a
system of vouchers, which should create a whole new class of small owners.
All new economic and financial legislation is being specifically tailored to
EC norms, with help from an army of City accountants, assessors, lawyers and
ex-patriate Poles.
At the same time Warsaw is maintaining tough wage controls to prevent the
kind of wage inflation and unemployment which has turned eastern Germany
into an economic disaster.
Such a policy could hardly be popular. The international financial community
has given two conditional votes of confidence - the Paris Club agreement in
March to reduce official debt by 50 per cent and the recent three-year IMF
adjustment loan. But both depend on Poland achieving tough economic targets.
But passive opposition to austerity policies is high - as revealed during
the presidential elections when a quarter of the electorate voted for the
previously unknown Polish-Canadian populist, Mr Stanislaw Tyminski.
Much depends on President Lech Walesa, whose support for the government's
anti-inflationary strategy could be crucial.
He undermined the first post-communist government led by Mr Tadeusz
Mazowiecki but virtually hand-picked the present government led by Mr Jan
Krzysztof Bielecki. Mr Walesa won his own personal mandate at the
presidential elections in December.
Ironically, however, Poland, which was the first to throw off the communist
yoke, is the last to hold free, multi-party general elections. The elections
were expected to take place in May but have been delayed, against Mr
Walesa's wishes, until October.
This means that parliament is still numerically dominated by former
communists, who were guaranteed 65 per cent of the seats by the 'round
table' agreement of April 1989 between the communist party and Solidarity,
while the government, dominated by the small, Gdansk-based 'Liberal
Democrat' party, has no popular mandate.
This is a shaky political foundation on which to base a tough economic
policy expected to lead to mass bankruptcies in coming months and see
unemployment rise from the current 1.3m to 2m and beyond by the end of the
year.
With elections in the offing, siren calls are being heard to ease up on wage
controls and go for faster growth, even at the expense of higher inflation.
The next few months could be crucial. If the government, backed by the
president, sticks to its guns, the first 'demolition' phase of transition to
the market could be over soon.
Already there is no mistaking the vitality of the private sector and the
alacrity with which Poles are adapting to the new rules of the game. Making
money is becoming the national obsession. A nation of shopkeepers appears to
have sprung up overnight.
However, many who were secure and even favoured by the old regime have
inevitably lost out.
Class and income divisions are widening rapidly after decades of artificial
equality, mediocrity and shortages of everything.
For some the cacophony of multi-party politics, the abrupt change in value
systems - not to speak of prices - is confusing, even threatening. Poles are
finding that democracy can be trying and 'normal' life in a 'free society'
frustrating as well as rewarding. But they have rejected illusions of a
'third way' between communism and capitalism and seem determined to make a
new brasher, richer and freer Poland work.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Business Law: The end of the hostile bidder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEO HERZEL and RICHARD SHEPRO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERGERS AND acquisitions have returned to business news headlines in the US,
but the latest transactions are different from those of the 1980s. Large US
and foreign corporations have for the most part replaced leveraged buy-outs
(LBO) promoters and other financial buyers as bidders. The main reason is
that financing for large LBOs and other non-industrial acquisitions has
virtually disappeared.
Whether friendly or hostile, these new bidders do not seem to be primarily
interested in breaking up companies or drastically altering them for quick
financial returns.
The acquisitions that have been announced or completed so far in the 1990s
probably have much to teach us about the likely future of acquisitions for
the remainder of the decade.
The friendly acquisition of MCA by Japan's Matsushita is a key recent
example of an acquisition by a foreign company based on industrial rather
than financial considerations.
Among strictly US acquisitions, the hostile bid for NCR by AT&amp;T, already
more than five months old, has many features in common with the first
hostile acquisition of the 1990s, the successful bid by Georgia Pacific for
Great Northern Nekoosa.
Neither bidder had ever launched a hostile bid before and both were
motivated by industrial concerns. Moreover, both bidders were capable of
financing their bids from their own cash flow and assets. In other words,
they did not have the difficult burden of assuring their lenders of
untroubled access to the cash flow and assets of the target. In both
instances, intense legal battles and proxy contests ensued, but price was
the likely factor in the outcomes.
Although a patient, well-financed, 1990s' bidder is unlikely in the long
term to be thwarted in a hostile offer, hostile bids appear to be as
expensive today as they ever were in the 1980s.
A key reason is that takeover defences remain effective. State statutes and
court decisions strongly favour defence. In addition, there is a large
amount of legal and market pressure on target boards of directors to demand
high prices.
For bidders, on the other hand, there is the real risk of overpayment.
Friendly bidders are not immune from the overpayment problem. This is not
surprising since the markets for hostile and friendly bids are closely
connected.
Rupert Murdoch, for example, was recently quoted in the FT as saying he had
overpaid by Dollars 1bn (Pounds 0.50bn) in his Dollars 3bn acquisition of
Triangle Communications, the publisher of TV Guide.
There are still no perfect takeover defences and there are unlikely ever to
be any. Neither state legislatures nor courts would like to appear to be
blocking all takeovers without regard to price.
For example, in Delaware, by far the most important state for the
incorporation of large public companies, there is concern that if perfect
takeover defences were ever available, institutional investors might
successfully push the administration and Congress towards federal
intervention. This could take the form of a federal law of incorporation
which would eliminate one of Delaware's main sources of revenue.
In particular, it is highly unlikely that state legislatures or courts will
do anything that would eliminate the importance of proxy fights. For one
thing, in the US, the right to vote shares is closely associated with
freedom of speech.
Proxy fights during hostile bids have picked up considerably in importance
in the past few years. The advantage they offer is that they allow a bidder
to elect its own board of directors to circumvent takeover defences.
Much more important, boards tend to abandon defences and negotiate in the
face of a likely defeat in a proxy fight. The disadvantage of proxy fights
for bidders is that they are slow and expensive.
Staggered boards of directors, in which only a third of the seats become
vacant each year, are an obstacle in a proxy contest. In theory, it could
take two years or more to gain control of a target's board. In practice,
however, the prospect of losing a third of the board usually leads to
capitulation.
NCR has a staggered board. The AT&amp;T victory in the March 28 vote was an
important factor in convincing the remaining directors that it was futile
not to negotiate with AT&amp;T. None the less, the stiff NCR defence appears to
have gained its stockholders an additional Dollars 20 per share.
Last year, in a surprising move, the legislature of Massachusetts held an
emergency session to pass a special, highly unusual, law requiring companies
incorporated in Massachusetts to have staggered boards.
The legislation was an unabashed attempt to help a local manufacturer,
Norton, fend off a hostile bid from BTR. Although Norton's defence against
BTR was notably anti-foreigner, Norton, facing an unsuccessful proxy fight
with BTR, eventually allowed itself to be taken over, at a much higher
price, by a French white knight, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain.
On the bidders' side, legal rules also contribute to high prices. There is
no urgent legal pressure on US bidders to avoid paying high prices. While
directors or target companies have to worry about personal liability for
defending too blindly or accepting too low a price in a friendly deal,
directors of bidders have little reason to be concerned about personal
liability.
Moreover, indemnification and liability insurance affect the two kinds of
directors differently. Bidders' directors, even if found liable, are likely
to be indemnified by the corporation without question.
Target directors, on the other hand, face the likelihood after a takeover of
a costly fight with the new owners of the corporation and directors and
officers' liability insurers to obtain indemnification or insurance
coverage, unless they settle before the takeover is completed.
There is still no perfect way to protect an agreement for a friendly
acquisition of a public company from higher, competing hostile bids.
In the 1980s, anyone planning a friendly acquisition or merger had to worry
about competition from highly aggressive, effective financial bidders.
However, today, likely sources of competition are usually limited to other
industrial bidders and their number appears to be sharply reduced. For
example, Matsushita faced no competition in its bid for MCA. And no
competing bidder has emerged for NCR.
A quick comeback for financial bidders is unlikely for a long time. The
machinery for doing 1980s-style leveraged acquisition deals has been largely
dismantled.
Lenders' and investors' attitudes have turned chilly and the political
atmosphere for financial bidders is negative due to the insider trading
scandals and disillusion with leverage.
Prospects for the success of domestic and foreign industrial bidders are
much more favourable because of the elimination of the highly potent,
flexible competition from financial buyers.
However, a cheap dollar should not be considered an advantage for foreign
bidders. Cheap dollars paid by foreign bidders get cheap dollars back. For
foreign bidders who want to speculate that the dollar will appreciate, there
are simpler, less risky ways than acquisitions.
Nevertheless, a surge in hostile bids by foreigners in the US is unlikely.
In the past, most bidders from countries other than Britain wisely avoided
hostile bids in the US. A proliferation of hostile foreign bids would
probably result in a swift negative political response.
Companies in countries such as Japan or Germany are particularly vulnerable
because their industries are highly competitive with US industries and
widely believed to be protected from hostile foreign bids and, in the case
of Japan, other forms of foreign competition.
Hostile bids by foreigners, therefore, are likely to remain scarce. On the
other hand, there are plenty of opportunities for friendly, negotiated
acquisitions in the US, at high prices.

FT  02 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Philips gains 6.2% after
quarterly figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUYING interest focused on Philips yesterday, as most bourses were closed
for the May Day holiday, writes Our Markets Staff.
AMSTERDAM was pleasantly surprised by Philips' performance in the first
quarter of 1991. The shares rose Fl 1.70 or 6.2 per cent to Fl 29 after the
company reported much better-than-expected net profits.
Philips apart, trading was quiet after Tuesday's holiday and in the absence
of continental investors. The CBS tendency index lost 0.1 to 95.4.
Aegon, the insurer, recovered Fl 2.10 to Fl 124.80. The stock has been weak
since the insurer said recently that it planned to reduce the conversion
price on an convertible bond as well as issue a new convertible bond next
year.
COPENHAGEN was helped by an excess of liquidity, following Tuesday's
postponement of a bank strike set for May 10. The bourse index rose 2.08 to
346.95.
Novo Nordisk, which attracted demand in New York overnight, was the most
active stock, rising DKr7 to DKr424 with 108,600 shares traded. Danisco
gained DKr12 to DKr947 after announcing the purchase of eight sugar
factories in eastern Europe.
ISTANBUL recovered half the losses recorded earlier this week as investors
picked up bargains. A cheaper dollar and fresh cash inflow of around L1
trillion, after a government bond matured, contributed to the recovery. The
75-share index gained 235.06 or 6.6 per cent to 3,789.31.
South Africa was closed yesterday for Workers' Day.

FT  02 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei climbs on hopes
of rate cut

<TEXT>
Tokyo
RENEWED speculation of an imminent cut in domestic interest rates
contributed to a broadly based rally yesterday, but the low volume led
dealers to wonder whether the uptrend could be sustained, writes Seth Sulkin
in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 377.75 ahead at 26,489.00 after a high for the day
of 26,529.84 and a low of 26,193.61. Gains outpaced losses by 862 to 143,
with 103 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
climbed 35.03 to 1,998.45, up 1.8 per cent compared with a gain of 1.4 per
cent for the Nikkei. Volume picked up to 350m shares from 230m. In London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.19 to 1,508.53.
The US Federal Reserve's overnight decision to lower the discount rate by
1/2 percentage point to 5.5 per cent raised hopes that the Bank of Japan
would follow suit.
The US discount rate is below Japan's for the first time in 14 years, and
there was talk that the Bank of Japan would cut its discount rate, currently
at 6 per cent, by  3/4 percentage point to bring it back below the US level.
Although interest rate-sensitive and large-capital issues were among
yesterday's favourites, dealers said the rally extended to virtually every
part of the market. All of the 36 sectoral indices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange advanced.
Mr George Nimmo, manager of equity sales at SBCI, questioned whether the
increased turnover signalled the start of a new rally. While modest investor
buying interest might be enough to push the Nikkei over 27,000, the uptrend
would not endure without a cut in Japan's discount rate, he said. With many
market participants away for the Golden Week holiday until next Tuesday,
there was little selling pressure, Mr Nimmo noted.
Among big-capital issues, NTT strengthened Y42,000 to Y989,000. Railroad and
infrastructure-related companies were also popular. Ishikawajima-Harima
Heavy Industries forged ahead Y39, more than 5 per cent, to Y765.
Earnings revisions featured for the second day in succession. Akai Electric
again set a record high, finishing Y100 ahead at Y970 following the
company's upward revised profits estimate for the fiscal year ending
November 30, 1991. Olympic Optical, boosted by its improved earnings
projection, registered an advance of Y50 or 5 per cent at Y1,100.
Sanrio, a leading maker of gift merchandise, contrasted with a fall of
almost 6 per cent following a sharp downward revision in pre-tax profits.
The share price finished Y220 off at Y4,000.
Video game makers and related component manufacturers advanced. Nintendo,
which holds a dominant market share, is expected to raise shipments of its
popular Super Family Computer after Golden Week. Its shares gained Y200 to
Y16,000, while those of Sega, another game maker, moved ahead Y200 to
Y11,700.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 363.10 to 29,145.40 on volume of almost 31m
shares.
Roundup
RISES IN Tokyo and on Wall Street, following the US interest rate cut, lent
some support to the Pacific Rim yesterday. Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok,
Manila and Bombay were closed.
NEW ZEALAND was encouraged by Tuesday's news of progress in the Carter Holt
Harvey (CHH) debt reduction programme. The Barclays index showed a modest
gain of 8.20 at 1,476.08 after fairly active turnover of NZDollars 24.7m, up
from NZDollars 20.4m.
CHH ended 7 cents up at NZDollars 1.80, after reaching a session's high of
NZDollars 1.84, following the news that it had sold its stake in a Japanese
pulp mill venture for NZDollars 260m.
The group also said that a subsidiary, NZ Forest Products, would soon sell
Simsmetal, an Australian scrap metal company, and its stake in Bridge Oil,
an Australian diamond and resources concern. The sales could raise up to
another NZDollars 400m. CHH shares have been under pressure in recent months
because of delays in the sale of assets.
AUSTRALIA recovered from its day's lows on domestic buying. The All
Ordinaries index was finally only 1.7 down at 1,532.5, after falling 12.5
earlier. Turnover came to ADollars 208m, down from ADollars 295m.
Among companies reporting results, Palmer Tube Mills receded 4 cents to
ADollars 1.20 and MIM, the mining group, lost 7 cents to ADollars 1.70.
HONG KONG rose on expectations of a cut in domestic interest rates. The Hang
Seng index added 42.87 at 3,631.23. Reports that Sino-British talks on the
future of Hong Kong's new airport might start again soon also encouraged
local speculators. Turnover was boosted to HKDollars 1.79bn from HKDollars
1.07bn, mostly by a large cross in Wing On shares accounting for HKDollars
692.61m.
TAIWAN fell in volatile trading in spite of a firm start. The weighted index
weakened 71.11 or 1.2 per cent to 5,850.18 as turnover expanded to a heavy
TDollars 91.8bn from TDollars 64.5bn.
SEOUL closed easier in light trading, although the financial and chemical
sectors rose after Yukong announced that it had struck oil in Egypt. The
composite stock index shed 1.22 to 644.39. Turnover was thin at Won123bn,
against Won170bn.
News that consumer prices had risen 5.4 per cent from January to April, more
than half of the government's target of 9 per cent for the year, weighed on
the market.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Money Markets: A further easing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a further easing of wholesale interest rates in London yesterday
after Tuesday's cut in the US discount rate encouraged speculation about
lower UK bank base rates. Trading was quiet with many European centres
closed for May Day.
Three-month sterling interbank fell to 11-11 9/16 from 11 3/4 -11 5/8 per
cent, while 12-month money was quoted at 11 5/16 -11 3/16 against 11 5/16
 11 1/4 per cent.
Prices of short sterling futures were steady on Liffe. June delivery opened
a little firmer at 88.84 and moved within a range of 88.79 to 88.86, before
closing unchanged at 88.83.
The Bank of England initially forecast a day-to-day credit shortage of
Pounds 750m on the cash market, but revised this to Pounds 700m at noon and
to Pounds 600m in the afternoon. Total assistance of Pounds 565m was
provided.
Before lunch the authorities bought Pounds 95m bank bills in band 2 at 11
13/16 per cent. In the afternoon another Pounds 360m bank bills were
purchased in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent. Late help of Pounds 110m was also
provided.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 237m, with exchequer transactions absorbing
Pounds 335m, a rise in the note circulation Pounds 135m and bank balances
below target Pounds 45m.
In New York the Federal Reserve added temporary reserve to the banking
system, via overnight system repurchase agreements, as Federal funds traded
as high as 6 1/8 per cent, against the new assumed target rate of 5 3/4 per
cent following Tuesday's easing of the Fed's monetary stance.
In Amsterdam the Dutch Central Bank left its intervention rate at 8.70 per
cent when offering six-day special advances to the domestic money market.
The new facility will replace Fl 2.55bn draining from the market today as an
earlier six-day pact expires.
In Tokyo unsecured overnight call money was steady at 8 7/32 per cent, but
may encounter upward pressure today ahead of a long weekend holiday closing
the financial markets tomorrow and on Monday.
Fixed periods had a soft tone, amid speculation that the Bank of Japan is
now more likely to cut its discount rate after Tuesday's move by the Fed,
despite official denials from Tokyo.

</HEADLINE>

The Australian government has come to a decision on the future of the wool
industry, the stockpile, the debt and future administration. The main
recommendations by the Vines committee have been accepted with modest
adjustments. The one of most concern to the industry is that relating to the
stockpile. There is no ban on disposal at the discretion of the committee to
be in control, in the rest of this year; nor is there a trigger point in
prices to permit release or not. The market meanwhile continues to
strengthen in Australia, and a record offering of British wool sold at
auction in Bradford at appreciably higher prices.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: NY exchanges to go under one
roof
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW YORK'S five commodities exchanges are to move under one roof in
Manhattan in mid-1994, ending years of indecision which has hampered
expansion plans.
Late on Tuesday night the board of the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex),
the world's largest energy futures market, agreed to sign a joint relocation
agreement with the four other exchanges involved. The signing was expected
to take place late yesterday or today.
Nymex, the third largest US futures market after the two Chicago exchanges,
had also been considering moving across the Hudson River to New Jersey.
Speculation on why Nymex left its decision so late pointed to poor relations
between Mr Lou Guttman, Nymex chairman, and Mr Martin Greenberg, chairman of
the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex), which is mainly a metals market.
Long-running merger talks between the two exchanges failed once again
earlier this year.
The futures commissions merchants who operate on the exchanges are keen to
cut costs through the use of a single location. Yesterday Mr Guttman said:
'We will work with the other exchanges to achieve a consolidation of
operations and other cost savings in advance of a move to the new location.'
The new building will be a couple of blocks north of Nymex's current
position in the World Trade Center.
Besides Nymex and Comex, the building will house the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa
Exchange, the New York Cotton Exchange and the New York Futures Exchange.
New York City will provide Dollars 145m towards the Dollars 260m project.

<TEXT>
PRICES at this week's Copenhagen fur auction rose by an average of 45 per
cent compared with the last auction in February.
More than 1m Scanblack mink skins were sold yesterday, with top pelts
fetching DKr420 each. On Tuesday all the 1.6m pelts on offer were sold.
The Copenhagen auction is Europe's biggest since the London fur auctions
closed in 1989. Danish Fur Sales said more than 425 buyers attended, and the
rise in prices indicated confirmation of recent optimism in the trade.
Italy and Germany were among the main buyers, alongside Greece, Hong Kong
and Korea, which have become big manufacturing centres for fur coats.
Mr Mike Allan of the Fur Education Council said yesterday the surge in
demand followed the first cold winter in Europe after three warm winters.
'The customers have realised that furs are the best way to keep warm in
winter,' he said.

uranium
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONTARIO Hydro will soon start looking for substantial new supplies of
uranium in the wake of its decision to cancel a contract with Denison Mines
of Toronto covering 40 per cent of its current needs.
Mr Douglas Smith, Ontario Hydro's director of fuels, said talks on new
long-term contracts would probably begin later this year, with deliveries
starting in 1994. A large portion of the purchases are likely to come from
new high-grade mines in Saskatchewan.
The Denison Mines contract was for 1.4m lbs a year rising to 5.4m lbs in
1994. It was cancelled after price negotiations collapsed. Denison has been
supplying the material from a low-grade underground mine near Elliot Lake,
northern Ontario, where production costs are about three times higher than
current market prices.
Ontario Hydro declines to reveal pricing details of its contract with
Denison, which was signed at the peak of the uranium market in the late 70s.
It is understood to be paying Denison more than USDollars 50 a lb, compared
to current spot market prices of USDollars 9-10 a lb.
The utility, which operates three nuclear power stations, is also reviewing
its contract for uranium supplied from northern Ontario by Rio Algom, a
subsidiary of Britain's RTZ. Ontario Hydro has the option of giving notice
on the 1.2m lbs-a-year Rio Algom contract this year, to take effect in 1993.
Rio Algom's production costs are understood to be lower than Denison's.
The cancellation of the Denison contract is a severe blow to the town of
Elliot Lake. It will mean the loss of 1,050 jobs, coming on top of 2,300
layoffs in the past year as a result of earlier cuts by Denison and Rio
Algom. Rio Algom has closed two of its three mines in the area.

<TEXT>
A HORMONE which rapidly increases the meat content of cattle, 'angel dust,'
should be banned according to Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner.
Mr MacSharry, while stressing that this was his personal view and not yet EC
policy, said he hoped to get a ban on clembuterol, one of a group of
hormones known as beta agonists, tacked on to the price package working its
way glacially through the council of farm ministers.
Although the EC banned the use of hormones to increase the yield of beef
stock in 1988, 'angel dust' is allowed for therapeutic purposes, mainly
fertility in cows. Evidence has emerged of growing abuse of clembuterol to
reduce fat levels and increase meat content. Cases have come to light in
Ireland and Belgium particularly.
Commission officials say the problem is not widespread, but risks turning
consumers - already chary of beef because of the 'mad cow' scare - further
against bovine meat. Angel dust, which gets to farmers through black
marketeers copying the tactics of drugs traffickers, produces meat which is
leathery and tasteless.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sweden sets about slicing the
cost of food - Robert Taylor outlines the benefits Swedes expect from
agricultural deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN is about to enjoy the first benefits of the long overdue deregulation
of its over-protected agricultural system.
A few days ago the ruling Social Democrats proposed a 10 per cent cut in
import controls which is expected to bring a 3 per cent to 5 per cent
reduction in food prices.
The country's parliament is expected to vote soon by a large cross-party
majority for the cut in duties. It is hoped the change will come into effect
on July 1, the day that sees the start of the phased removal of Sweden's
internal agricultural market controls agreed last year.
With a general election less than five months away the government is also
promising to cut the present 25 per cent value added tax on food, though
this will have to wait until the autumn. All of a sudden the political
parties in Sweden are competing with each other for the favours of the
electorate in their commitment to cheap food in a country which has the most
expensive food in the world.
Mr Matts Hellstrom, the agriculture minister, said: 'The new food reforms
will put the consumer at the centre of our priorities.' The Swedish
government is committed to the introduction of free market principles of
supply and demand in agriculture, which means a radical break with more than
half a century of protectionism in the name of self-sufficiency.
The new liberalising policy announced in July 1990 is intended to eliminate
excess food production which has led to the export of surpluses, especially
grain, onto world markets at a financial cost to the Swedish taxpayer
amounting to as much as Skr2bn - Skr3bn (Pounds 189m - Pounds 284m) a year,
10 per cent of the total income from agriculture.
Mr Hellstrom said: 'The system of collective financing of agricultural
exports must be abolished if the national economy, the farmers and the
consumers are to benefit from the reform.' From July 1 this year the phase
out starts on internal market controls for grain, milk, eggs and meat.
It has already been agreed that Sweden's farmers will receive SKr13.6bn in
compensation as they adjust to the realities of the free market during a
five year transition that will last until 1995.
The money is to be spent on cutting milk and grain production and
encouraging farmers to switch from growing grain to other forms of
cultivation. Public resources are also being put into environmentally
acceptable energy production like bio-fuels as a way of encouraging the
rural sector to diversify.
The ruling Social Democrats emphasise Swedish agriculture must accept the
changes being proposed. These will eventually ensure Sweden has the same
support level as that existing inside the European Community.
Bilateral negotiations are going on between Stockholm and Brussels to look
at ways of improving the possibilities for Sweden's food and agricultural
industries in exporting their produce into the EC.
Mr Hellstrom said: 'I believe in increased freedom of trade and I am
convinced that Swedish producers can do well in a larger international
market. Free trade means both freedom and choice for consumers as well as
producers.'
He remains very hopeful that a broad agreement can be achieved through the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by the end of this year which will
exert a further downward pressure on the level of food prices in Sweden with
greater access for foreign goods.
The warm welcome that has been given to the Swedish government's proposed
reforms suggests they are long overdue in a country that continues to have
some of the highest food prices in the world. On average households spend 20
per cent of their budgets on the purchase of food. During the 1980s food
prices in Sweden rose faster than in other western European countries and at
a higher rate than the country's overall inflation.
Of course, Sweden's farm lobby does not see it that way and Mr Hellstrom has
been accused of betraying agriculture. Demonstrations by angry farmers can
be expected in protest against the changes. But only an estimated 3 per cent
of Swedes are employed on the land, less than a tenth of the country is
cultivated and agriculture accounts for a mere 2 per cent of Sweden's gross
domestic product.
The surprise is that the government has not acted sooner for the high cost
of living in Sweden has meant persistent wage-push inflation and hurt the
country's international competitiveness in its export industries.
An assault on food prices was long overdue through a shake-up of an
agricultural system that belonged to a bygone age.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Big sugar crop unlikely to lift
Brazilian exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL is expecting a bumper sugar crop this year, but market sources say
excess production is unlikely to result in higher exports. The Association
of Sugar and Alcohol Industries of Sao Paulo (AIAA) has forecast a 9 per
cent rise in sugar output this year compared to the harvest of 1990-91, one
of the worst years on record.
According to the association Brazil's next sugar harvest will produce 158m
bags. The rise will occur due to improved productivity, rather than any
increase in area planted. Most of the excess production will come from the
central-south area of the country.
Exporters believe the association's forecast is accurate. Mr Mauricio
Fernandes, president of the sugar exporter Magman Comercio Internacional,
said: 'All our preliminary analyses point to an increase of about 10 per
cent in sugar output this year.' Observers believe, however, rising demand
for sugar-derived alcohol market will continue to put a lid on exports.
Those shortages might get worse, analysts say. During the Gulf war sales of
cars run on alcohol surged, and the Brazilian government has said it will be
reluctant to release sugar for export in the face of insufficient supply at
home.
Mr Luiz Bertelli, superintendent of the AIAA, said: 'A rise in sugar
production only means that the Sao Paulo area may become self-sufficient
this year, reducing the region's need to import sugar from the north-east.'
The United States has agreed to abolish the countervailing duty on the
importation of frozen orange juice concentrate from Brazil. According to
orange producers here, the move is an important concession in the battle to
eradicate import barriers on orange juice from Brazil.

FT  02 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Dealing with the withholding
tax - Italy is reforming its rules on the bond levy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS at the Italian Ministry of Finance say reimbursements of
withholding tax due to foreign holders of domestic government bonds will be
made within 60 days of applications being received.
The commitment to repay promptly follows the introduction of new procedures
last month.
As a result, the officials say they hope to clear the backlog of withholding
tax payments, some of which have been outstanding for almost five years, in
time for Italy's annual September mini-budget.
According to the officials, the Finance Ministry is also considering the
wholesale abolition of withholding tax for foreign bondholders. 'We haven't
excluded the hypothesis of abolition,' one said.
The news on withholding tax is bound to intensify the growing competition
between the Italian and Spanish government bond markets, both of which have
been attracting greater numbers of foreign investors this year.
The relatively high-coupon Italian and Spanish government bond markets have
been the best performing in Europe this year.
The Italian decision to introduce an accelerated procedure for repaying
withholding tax follows closely on last week's announcement that the Spanish
Treasury is preparing new rules to facilitate the quick repayment of a 25
per cent withholding tax on government paper bought by non-residents.
According to the Italian officials, application forms for the repayment of
withholding tax, which has been levied at 12.5 per cent since 1987, were
sent to foreign embassies earlier this month.
The forms, which come in separate versions for normal investors and
supranational organisations respectively, have now been circulated among the
banking community in Italy and abroad.
Finance Ministry officials do not know when the first returns, which will be
collated by depository banks, acting as intermediaries between investors and
the Italian authorities, will be returned. However, one depository bank in
Milan said that it expected to send its first repayment claims to Rome
'within a matter of days'.
The Finance Ministry officials estimate that withholding tax repayments will
cost L350bn (Dollars 268.4m) in the first year. That will rise to L600bn if
the accelerated procedure, which will remove a serious thorn in the flesh of
the Italian market as far as foreign investors are concerned, stimulates
trading as expected.
Full-scale abolition of withholding tax for eligible foreigners has not been
ruled out for a later stage. 'Abolition is one of the solutions which is
being studied,' says a senior aide to Mr Rino Formicam, the finance
minister. 'The minister is actively interested in the solution of this
problem.'
Abolition would remove the need to process repayment applications - a
procedure which could become more onerous if the market continues to develop
at its present pace. It would also act as a further stimulus to trading,
which is now running at around L5,000bn, with daily peaks of up to L6,500bn,
on the screen-based primary dealers' market alone.
'In the end, it's in our interest to attract capital,' said the official.
The Finance Ministry recognises that by removing withholding tax it runs the
risk of allowing abuses, should local investors buy bonds through foreign
vehicles in order to escape taxation.
'The danger is of private Italian investors taking their money to a
fiduciary outside Italy,' noted one dealer. 'But we have argued that the
effect, if only minimal, could be ignored. And if there are big flows, the
effect would be beneficial in bringing interest rates down.'
Ironically, the chances of eliminating the tax for eligible foreigners will
probably depend on how well the new repayment procedure performs. If it
comes up to scratch, the Italian authorities will feel under much less
pressure to move further.
To accelerate processing, the Finance Ministry is centralising repayments in
Rome, in
order to allow maximum flexibility in staff allocation, and to enable senior
officials to keep direct tabs on the speed with which claims are being
treated.
However, officials recognise that they could face difficulties meeting their
planned timetable as they are still uncertain about the level of demand for
repayment and the type of claims likely to be made.
'Obviously, it's much easier to process a relatively small number of big
claims than hundreds or thousands of smaller ones,' says the official.
After having waited almost five years in some cases to get their money back,
foreign investors will be pleased that the need for repayment has finally
been recognised as an issue. However, they will also need to be convinced
that the system will work.

FT  02 MAY 91 / International Bonds: Yankee paper moves into spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW issues emerged in the Eurobond market, even though most of Europe was
closed for May Day.
But borrowers requiring dollar financing are currently looking more closely
at the Yankee bond market - the US market for foreign borrowers - where
funding is now cheaper for maturities of seven years and longer than in the
Eurobond market, according to traders.
Secondary market spreads have tightened due to firm institutional demand for
corporate debt at that area of the yield curve.
A US unit of ICI tapped the Yankee bond market yesterday via Merrill Lynch,
raising Dollars 250m of 10-year senior notes which were priced to yield 75
basis points above the 10-year Treasury. The deal sold out shortly after
launch, according to the lead manager.
However, Unilever Capital Corporation, which tapped the shorter end of the
market, chose to fund in the Eurobond market. Distribution of Unilever's
Dollars 250m five-year Eurobond was hampered by the holiday in continental
Europe, but lead manager JP Morgan said that much of the issue had already
been placed.
Competitive rates in the Yankee market have also enticed supranational
agencies, historically better liked by European than by US investors, to the
Yankee bond market.
The Inter-American Development Bank brought a Dollars 300m 10-year issue,
via Goldman Sachs. The IADB, paying a margin of 49 basis points above the
10-year US Treasury yield, saved several basis points by tapping the US
foreign bond market rather than the Eurobond market, dealers said.
It is the second offering by a supranational agency in the Yankee bond
market within a week, following a Dollars 300m offering by the Asian
Development Bank, at a similar spread, via Salomon Brothers.
In the Eurobond market, firm demand for a Pounds 200m mortgage-backed issue
reflected the improving performance of the sector, which is still recovering
from a slump early this year after the Bank of England announced a potential
increase in the capital weighting for mortgage-backed securities held by
banks.
The Pounds 200m issue of fixed and floating rate notes backed by mortgages
originated by National Home Loans, a specialist mortgage lender, was priced
attractively, dealers said.
Fixed-rate, mortgage-backed securities appear to be becoming better accepted
by investors.
The Pounds 100m portion of five-year fixed-rate bonds was priced to yield 98
basis points above the five-year gilt, a slight pick-up over the Household
Mortgage Corporation's recent issue. The new deal was bid at 97 basis points
at the end of the day.

AUSTRALIA was the top-performing bond market in April, both in US dollar and
local currency terms, according to JP Morgan's Government Bond Index
Monitor.
All the government bond markets showed positive returns last month in local
currency terms, but Australia led with a 2.56 per cent gain. The Australian
market was boosted by falling yields, and headed the performance tables in
US dollar terms with a 3.43 per cent return, helped by a moderate currency
gain.
Over the past year, the Australian market has shown a 26.67 per cent return
in local currency terms (31.9 per cent gain in US dollar terms), making it
the second best performing bond market after the UK.
Apart from the UK gilts market, all the European government bond markets
showed strong returns of more than 1 per cent in April.
Japan was the worst performing bond market in local currency terms, with
only a 0.15 per cent increase. However, the strong appreciation of the yen
meant that Japan showed a 3.25 per cent gain in US dollar terms and
therefore ranked second after Australia.
France, Spain and Australia have shown the strongest gains since the start
of 1991, with returns of 8.64, 8.26, and 8.03 per cent respectively.
Japanese government bonds showed the best return in April in sterling terms,
according to Kemper Investment Management Company.
For a sterling-based investor, the return on Japanese government bonds was
5.08 per cent in April. New Zealand showed a 4.84 per cent gain and
Australia a 4.4 per cent gain.

THE Venezuelan government has issued a public call to parties interested in

Banco Republica, writes Joe Mann in Caracas.
Tenders will be sought later this year from groups the government classifies
as qualified bidders. Banco Republica is the third commercial bank the
Venezuelan government has put on the block over the past year. The state
holds just over 90 per cent of the bank's stock.
According to Venezuelan banking law, foreigners can hold no more than 20 per
cent of shares in a banking entity, but this restriction is likely to be
eased.
The administration has expressed interest in opening up Venezuela's
financial system to international banks.
In other privatisations, including airlines and telecommunications, it is
seeking majority foreign participation.

FT  02 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Turkish and Soviet banks in
joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKIYE Emlak Bankas, the country's third largest bank, is to set up an
offshore banking joint venture with Tveruniversalbank of the Soviet Union.
The new bank will operate in Istanbul's free trade zone. Offshore banking
was legalised in September last year, and the government hopes that Turkey
will attract business which currently goes to centres in the Arab Middle
East.
The joint venture is the second between Turkish and Soviet banks. Last
month, Ziraat, the state-owned agriculture bank, announced plans for a joint
venture with a Soviet bank.
Emlak is understood to be also discussing setting up a joint venture bank in
the Soviet Union with Tveruniversalbank to finance bilateral trade and
construction projects.
Trade relations between Turkey and the Soviet Union are expanding rapidly
because of Turkish purchases of Soviet natural gas. Last year, Turkey bought
4.1bn cubic metres of Soviet natural gas at a cost of Dollars 1.5bn, but

To date, four privately-owned Turkish banks and four foreign banks -

FT  02 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Philadelphia SE plans
cross-rate options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PHILADELPHIA Stock Exchange plans to launch three cross-currency option
contracts later this month.
The contracts - D-Mark/yen, sterling/yen and sterling/D-Mark - are expected
to receive Securities and Exchange Commission approval shortly, once
clearing problems have been ironed out. Because they are the first
non-dollar based currency options in the US, clearing and settlement process
are more complicated, according to the exchange.
The D-Mark/yen and sterling/yen contracts will be based and settled in yen,
with contract sizes of DM1m and Pounds 500,000 respectively. The
sterling/D-Mark contract is based in D-Marks, with a Pounds 500,000 contract
size.
'By taking the dollar out of the equation, (our) cross-rate options allow
you to hedge the currency risk you're trying to manage, without adding an
extra level of risk,' said the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.
Meanwhile, the International Monetary Market on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange has delayed the launch of its futures and options on futures
contracts on three cross-rates - D-Mark/sterling, D-Mark/yen, and
D-Mark/French francs - which had been approved by the Commodities and
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
The contract specifications have been re-submitted for CFTC approval to
allow for changes in the settlement dates to coincide with the expiry of
existing contracts.
The CME decided to stick to dollar-based contracts, because they are more
complementary to existing products, facilitating trading and arbitrage
between contracts, an official said.
The over-the-counter market in foreign exchange derivatives still dwarfs
exchange-listed trading in these products. However, the declining
credit-worthiness of many bank counterparties has helped edge some currency
option users towards exchange-listed products. Further, the exchanges hope
to benefit from increased use of currency options by investment managers.
Companies, substantial users of the market to hedge cash-flows, are more
likely to need specially tailored products which match particular
cash-flows.
Again trying to capture business from the over-the-counter market, the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange is looking at the possibility of introducing
longer-dated options in the most liquid contracts.
The exchange is considering adding 18-month or two-year options to the
current 12-month maximum.
The size of the over-the-counter market is notoriously hard to estimate, but
turnover is believed to be around Dollars 25bn-a-day equivalent, compared
with Dollars 6bn or Dollars 7bn in exchange-traded products worldwide.

FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: An uncertain future in Brazil -
A report on the effects of economic instability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUGGESTING someone invest in Brazil these days has all the connotations of
asking, 'Would you buy a used car from this man?' about a dubious character
in a scruffy raincoat.
The country, which in the 1970s was 'the' place to invest, with annual
growth rates of 10 per cent and in the 1980s was a place to sit tight and
occasionally reap very high profits, has in the 1990s become a sour taste in
the mouths of many multi-nationals.
After five economic shocks and price freezes in as many years and an
inflation record resembling a series of heart attacks on an
electrocardiograph, foreign companies operating in Brazil have grown used to
uncertainty.
But, as a result of President Fernando Collor's tight monetary policy and
the ensuing 4.6 per cent contraction in the economy, this year for the first
time has seen a wave of multi-nationals putting the blame for poor results
worldwide largely on their Brazilian subsidiaries.
There is little sympathy to be found in the corridors of Brasilia. Mr Marcos
Azambuja, director-general of Brazil's Foreign Ministry, protests:
'Multi-nationals have got too used to expecting Brazil to lay them golden
eggs every year.'
But, as recession deepens and Brazil reels from its latest economic
stabilisation plan, the situation is expected to worsen. After years of
faith in the future, many multi-nationals are now thinking seriously about
whether to stay. Some have already gone - generally those with smaller
investments or with factories elsewhere in Latin America. Those who have
stayed are currently slashing investment projects and laying off employees.
'It's wartime in Brazil,' said Mr Folke Asell, head of Electrolux Brazil.
So bad is the situation that in February a group of multi-nationals claiming
to represent 90 per cent of their colleagues presented a scathing report to
the economy minister, describing why Brazil was no longer an attractive
investment. It concluded: 'It is not possible to integrate with the first
world through third world policies.'
What happened last year to make multi-nationals so angry? Most, publicly at
least, had welcomed the free market ambitions of President Collor, who took
office last March promising a new Brazil and his ending of price controls,
even if privately some jibed at the idea of losing long-held monopolies.
The 41-year-old president's first mistake was to seize remittances of
foreign companies along with 80 per cent of national assets frozen in a
drastic liquidity squeeze, raising more than an eyebrow in headquarters
worldwide. Only after intense lobbying were the remittances freed last
autumn.
By then, the economy seemed to be moving again, after three months of almost
standstill. But an over-valued cruzeiro ruined competition of exports, and
by the last quarter the tight monetary policy, which is an integral part of
President Collor's anti-inflation plan, was having its effect, bringing
results most described as catastrophic.
Published results to November showed 38 per cent of companies were suffering
losses, and since then sales have fallen dramatically.
By the end of last year, when inflation was running once more above 20 per
cent a month and industrial activity in Brazil's largest city, Sao Paulo,
had fallen by 11 per cent, the Collor plan seemed all bad effects and no
good results. Real interest rates were, at more than 10 per cent a month,
perhaps the highest in the world. The unfavourable exchange rate meant
companies could no longer use the traditional escape route of exports and
those committed to contracts took a beating. When this was finally adjusted
with a rapid devaluation in November and December, it was too late for many.
In search of a scapegoat for the failure of their policies, the government
turned on multi-nationals, particularly Autolatina, the holding company for
Ford and Volkswagen, and the pharmaceutical companies, and summoned them
unceremoniously to Brasilia to explain 'abusive price-rises.' Mr Edson Musa,
president of Rhodia, Brazilian subsidiary of the France's Rhone Poulenc,
called the move 'economic terrorism.'
The final blow to the government's credibility was the introduction of a
plan in February freezing wages and prices, despite previous insistence this
would not happen.
A repeated criticism by foreign companies is the uncertainty of the exchange
rate. Last year, devaluation at 1,333.8 per cent failed to keep up with
inflation of 1,794.9 per cent. One company hard-hit by this was Autolatina,
which ended last year with losses and has been shedding workers in reaction
to a 20 per cent fall in sales since November.
Mr James Donaldson, the company's managing director, is fed up: 'Brazil has
gone backwards. Car production has dropped 25 per cent since 1980. So far is
Brazil from the solid export base we expected that we are now shifting some
production to Kentucky.'
Also affected was General Electric's subsidiary in Brazil - their second
biggest. With 40 per cent of its business made up by exports and most of the
rest by government contracts, the company suffered both sides with the
cutting of state spending. According to its financial director, Mr Don
McBride: 'We broke even with probably enough in dollar terms.' Owed Dollars
27m by the government, the company has cut production in three divisions and
Mr McBride said there may soon be lay-offs once it finishes its backlog of
orders.
Mr McBride is not optimistic about the future: 'We will restructure to the
size of the market and must at some point in the future decide if we want to
be in the market at all. . . It's a big market. It's hard to throw away.'
Black &amp; Decker, Phillips and Parker are among those companies which have
closed some operations. Parker finds importing pens from Europe cheaper than
producing in Brazil, while Black &amp; Decker can source the market from
elsewhere in Latin America. Foreign banks, such as First Chicago, hit by the
global recession, turned to Brazil first when it closed offices.
Others with large investments are holding on. The US company, Caterpillar,
the world's largest producer of earth-moving equipment, says it will stay,
though it is suspending investments and blaming its Brazilian subsidiary for
its 58 per cent fall in profits worldwide. The company's report stated: 'If
the current situation continues, return of our Brazilian operation to profit
is unlikely in 1991.'
Oil companies, too, suffered because the government kept fuel prices low as
part of its anti-inflationary policy. Shell, Esso and Atlantic have all been
operating in the red since November. Shell has cut investment plans this
year by 40 per cent.
Price controls are not the only government intervention multi-nationals
complain about. Brazilian tax on foreign investment is, according to the
multinationals' report, the highest in the world. The Brazilian subsidiary
of the Swedish company, Electrolux, is planning to challenge in court the
high tax on its profit, which in dollar terms translated to losses.
Even the lure of cheap labour and 152m potential market are no longer seen
as enough attraction. There are frequent complaints about shoddy workmanship
and General Electric, for example, has to use seven quality control checks
on just one production line.
Focusing all on defeating inflation at the expense of growth, Brazil is
losing out to other countries, such as Mexico, Venezuela and eastern Europe.
Foreign investment for the first half of 1990 was a negative Dollars 168m.
The situation has not been helped by Brazil's foot-dragging on negotiations
of its foreign debt.
Mr Joel Korn, president of Bank of America in Brazil, warned: 'The longer
Brazil takes to get back on track and project more credibility
internationally, the worse it will be, because some investment decisions
cannot wait.'
A sign that Brazil may finally be waking up to this came last month in the
form of new central bank measures allowing companies to remit profits
without going through the bureaucratic process of registration.

PIONEER International, the Australian building products and oil group, is to
raise ADollars 178.5m (USDollars 139.4m) through a placement of 70m shares
at ADollars 2.55 a share.
In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange yesterday, Pioneer said the
money would enable it 'to take advantage of potential expansion
opportunities in south-East Asia and in Europe in building materials
activity.'
Pioneer said the money would also be used to reduce some debt.
The placement is being fully underwritten by stockbroker J. B. Were and
Sons.
Pioneer's share price remained steady at ADollars 2.68 following the
announcement.
The group has building supplies businesses in Australia, the UK, US,
Germany, Spain, Hong Kong and Singapore. It reported a 40 per cent rise in
net profit for the six months to December 31, to ADollars 88m, helped by
rising oil prices during the recent Gulf conflict.

<TEXT>
THE RECESSION and tougher competition, particularly for the US fast-food
subsidiary, hit first-quarter earnings of Imasco, the tobacco, financial
services and retailing group which is 40 per cent-owned by BAT Industries of
the UK.
The tobacco products business continued the largest single contributor and
escaped the impact of recent sharp tax increases at retail.
The Canada Trustco financial services subsidiary, on a consolidated basis,
was second-largest contributor but was affected by the recession and larger
loan loss provisions.
Overall, first-quarter profit was CDollars 51.9m (USDollars 44.7m), down 22
per cent from CDollars 66.6m a year earlier, equal to 38 cents a share,
against 50 cents. Revenues were CDollars 1.1bn, up 1 per cent.
Hardees Food Systems made a negative contribution because of difficult
fast-food markets in the US, but improvement is expected with aggressive
marketing and cuts in overhead.
The Canadian drug store business did better despite the recession.
Imperial Tobacco is expected to gain cigarette market share in Canada beyond
the present 60.2 per cent, offsetting the impact of retail tax increases.
Imasco expects a slow second quarter, but results should pick up with the
North American economy in the second half this year.
St Laurence Cement, controlled by the Swiss Holderbank Group, had a
first-quarter loss of CDollars 13.2m, or 32 cents a share, against a loss of
CDollars 961,000, or 2 cents, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 58.6m
against CDollars 105m.
BP Canada had a first-quarter loss of CDollars 6.2m against a profit of
CDollars 6m, or 12 cents a share, a year ago, on revenues of CDollars 73.5m
against CDollars 92m.

SANFORD, New Zealand's largest fishing company, lifted net earnings for the

months to February 28, writes Terry Hall in Wellington.
The company has recently acquired the deep-sea fishing interests of Skeggs
Seafoods, which, absorbed Fletcher Challenge's interests last year. The
latest results do not include earnings from these interests. Sales and gross
revenue rose 6 per cent to NZDollars 82.06m from NZDollars 77.77m, while
pre-tax profit rose 13 per cent to NZDollars 10.21m (NZDollars 9.05m). Total
assets rose 14 per cent to NZDollars 105.65m.

PHILIP MORRIS, the US foods and tobacco group, has re-organised Jacobs
Suchard, the Swiss company for which it paid Dollars 3.8bn last year, into a
pan-European chocolate and coffee group which is expected to generate sales
of more than SFr6bn (Dollars 4.1bn) this year.
Mr Raymond Viault, the new chief executive, said that Jacobs Suchard had
already contributed to the good first-quarter results of its US parent, but
he gave no figures.
Philip Morris posted a 21.5 per cent advance to Dollars 942m in net earnings
for the three months.
Of the original Jacobs Suchard operations, Mr Klaus Jacobs, the majority
shareholder, has retained the EJ Brach candy company in the US, the Nabob
coffee business in Canada, the Van Houten bulk chocolate company in Europe
and three small banks.
The Asian, Pacific and Latin American operations have been transferred to
other Philip Morris management divisions, leaving a core European business
with 1990 sales of SFr4.3bn.
To this has been added the Kraft General Foods operations in Scandinavia,
France and Germany.

CONTINENTAL Airlines, the US carrier caught up in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings, reported a first-quarter net loss of Dollars 194.8m, which it
blamed on the domestic recession and the impact of the Gulf war on air
travel.
However, Mr Rick Shuyler, chief financial officer, said he was optimistic
the airline would 'continue to show marked progress with its restructuring
and that the summer months will be quite favourable for the company'.
Continental said it had a first-quarter operating loss of Dollars 157.8m, on
revenues of Dollars 1.3bn. This compared with operating income of Dollars
8.8m and net income of Dollars 21.3m on revenues of Dollars 1.3bn in the
same period last year.
The results were only for Continental Airlines and not other affiliates of
its holding company, which will report consolidated results soon.
Mr Shuyler said: 'The Gulf war had a significant restraining effect on
worldwide travel, but by the end of the quarter we saw a resurgence in
demand. The recession also challenged our ability to develop traffic and
maintain favourable yields during the first three months of the year.'
Continental is considering a reorganisation involving unsecured creditors of
its parent and the main airline business converting into equity.

DOMINION Textile, Canada's only surviving integrated textile group, had big

recession and high raw material costs.
However, it said the denim market, in which it is a North American leader,

it expects improvement in the final quarter.
The third-quarter loss was CDollars 23.4m (USDollars 20.10m), or 73 cents a

attributable to the common stock after preferred dividends. Sales were
CDollars 302m against CDollars 317m.
The nine months' loss was CDollars 58.5m, or CDollars 1.93 a share, against

THE NORTH AMERICAN recession, a collapse in resource earnings, and problems
with its investment in Laidlaw, hit Canadian Pacific hard in the first
quarter. It was the worst quarter for the group since the depth of the 1982
recession.
The big holding company posted a loss of CDollars 5.3m, or 2 cents a share,
against a profit of CDollars 476.2m (USDollars 410. m), or 24 cents, a year
earlier, on revenues of CDollars 2.45bn against CDollars 2.56bn.
Operating earnings fell to CDollars 81.9m from CDollars 139.9m.
The first-quarter loss had been widely expected, but CP warned that results
would continue to be 'disappointing' until the economy turned around.
The big forest products subsidiary, depressed by weak newsprint and pulp
markets, posted a heavy loss. CP Rail and the other transportation
subsidiaries were down sharply, as was the property development subsidiary.
Only PanCanadian Petroleum made a higher contribution, while
telecommunications and machinery manufacturing were lower.
CP included a loss of CDollars 3.9m on its investment in Laidlaw, the big
waste management and school bus group, against income of CDollars 8.8m a
year earlier. The results included CP's equity share of Laidlaw's write-down
in its investment in ADT of Britain.
In succeeding quarters, Laidlaw will be making a positive contribution. CP
has voting control of Laidlaw and nearly 20 per cent of the total equity.
For the rest of 1991, CP will benefit from seasonal upturns in the rail
business, hotels and possibly property operations, and also from lower
interest rates.
But forest products and coal will continue depressed and oil and gas income
may decline.

30%

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Dynamics, the second largest US defence contractor, said yesterday
that it expects to cut its 90,000 workforce by at least 30 per cent by the
mid-1990s because of lower US defence spending.
The figures, given at the company's annual meeting, reflect both the
Pentagon's budget cuts and a new broom approach at General Dynamics under Mr
William Anders, the group's recently-appointed chairman.
Mr Anders, a blunt-speaking former astronaut, is not sure the defence
spending downturn is ever going to be reversed, and he has decided to slash
the company's employment and research budgets while possibly pushing it into
entirely new business areas.
Mr James Mellor, the company president, told the meeting that while it had
spent Dollars 1.6bn on new capital projects over the past four years, it
planned to spend only Dollars 575m over the next four.
The US defence budget is likely to shrink by 25 per cent over the next five
years, and all main contractors face sharp cutbacks. But few have yet been
as forthright as General Dynamics about the consequences.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AEGON, the second largest insurance group in the Netherlands, plans to merge
its Dutch health care insurance subsidiary with Nuts, a domestic mutual
health group, in a bid to increase its market share and take advantage of
economies of scale.
The new insurer, to be called Nuts-Aegon, will be the second-largest private
health insurer in the Netherlands, after Zilveren Kruis, with annual premium
income of around Fl 570m (Dollars 300m). Aegon will hold slightly less than
50 per cent of the new company's shares, with Nuts owning the rest.
Together, Aegon and Nuts handle the health insurance of nearly 500,000
people in the Netherlands.
The planned merger, which is due to take effect in January 1992, follows the
breakdown of talks in late 1990 between Aegon, Nationale-Nederlanden and
Delta Lloyd on co-operating in health insurance. The talks foundered after
Nat-Ned announced plans to merge with NMB Postbank and to use its new
distribution channel to sell insurance alongside its traditional links with
independent insurance brokers.
Delta Lloyd, a subsidiary of Commercial Union of the UK, intends to use some
of Nuts-Aegon's services, starting with such areas as computer processing
and the buying of health care at hospitals and clinics.

FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: Philips posts 'encouraging'
return to profits in quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group which ran up heavy losses in 1990,
yesterday reported an 'encouraging' return to profits in the first quarter
of 1991 and repeated its earlier predictions that it will end the year in
the black.
Mr Henk Appelo, the group's finance director, said first-quarter results
were slightly better than expected, but cautioned against excessive
optimism, saying the same strong improvement might not be repeated in the
second quarter. The real fruits of the company's extensive restructuring
programme were not expected until the second half of this year.
Net profit from normal business operations, currently the best measure of
Philips' performance, soared to Fl 135m (Dollars 71m) in the first quarter
from just Fl 6m in the 1990 quarter.
Overall net profit also totalled Fl 135m against Fl 336m in 1990, when the
net figure had been inflated by book profits of Fl 330m from the sale of
defence electronics subsidiaries. The results were above analysts'
forecasts, helping to push up Philips' shares by Fl 1.70 to Fl 29 at the
close in Amsterdam.
Philips said operating profit rose nearly 50 per cent from Fl 450m to Fl
655m, while turnover fell 2 per cent to Fl 12.5bn.
Mr Appelo said operating profit remained too low as a percentage of
turnover. 'But all our product sectors were back in the black,' he said,
noting that Philips' professional products and components sectors had
stemmed their losses and returned to profitability.
At the same time, however, the group's two most profitable sectors, lighting
and consumer electronics, saw a decline in operating earnings. Lighting's
earnings fell to Fl 135m from Fl 192m, due mainly to a downturn in the US
and Brazil. Consumer products declined to Fl 298m from Fl 364m, partly as a
result of sluggish consumer spending in a number of countries.
Other computer activities broke even, enabling professional products to post
an operating profit of Fl 70m against a loss of Fl 96m a year earlier.
Components also turned a loss of Fl 23m to show a profit of Fl 65m in the
quarter.
Mr Appelo said overall losses in North America fell by a third against the
same period of 1990. The group remained in the red in Latin America but
posted gains in Europe. In 1990 as a whole, Philips posted a record net loss
of Fl 4.24bn, reflecting Fl 4.65bn in restructuring charges taken to slim
down its ailing computer and semi-conductor divisions and to trim its
worldwide workforce by nearly 20 per cent.

FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: Chrysler follows the trend with
Dollars 598m loss

CHRYSLER, the financially stretched US motor manufacturer, yesterday
continued the American industry's dismal set of first-quarter results by
announcing a net loss of Dollars 598m.
Mr Lee Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, said bluntly: 'The quarter was abysmal.
Industry volume simply collapsed and, as a result, we suffered our worst car
and truck retail sales since the first quarter of 1983.'
The US industry has been hit by a sharp downturn in consumer demand, due to
the Gulf war and recession, at a time when it was already suffering from
overcapacity. On Tuesday, General Motors announced a first-quarter loss of
Dollars 1.17bn, excluding special items, and Ford reported losses of Dollars
884m.
Chrysler, the smallest of Detroit's Big Three, is financially most
vulnerable to the downturn. It requires heavy capital expenditure over the
next two years to introduce a new range of cars which are needed to bolster
its market share.
The loss, representing Dollars 2.66 a share, compared with net income of
Dollars 71m, or 32 cents a share, in the same period last year. The loss was
Dollars 341m when the company excluded a one-time charge for a change in
accounting methods, but this lower figure was also affected by special
factors - on the negative side, Dollars 199m of costs for cuts in the
company's salaried workforce, and on the positive side a Dollars 242m
after-tax credit for a reduction in costs associated with its acquisition of
American Motors in 1987. Revenues dropped from Dollars 7.63bn to Dollars
5.8bn.
Mr Iacocca said retail buyers had simply dropped out of the market during
the quarter and the company was forced to take on rental business which
required very expensive marketing incentives.
Chrysler's assembly plants ran at less than half capacity during the
quarter, and it built 115,600 fewer units during the period than in the
fourth quarter of last year.

Adsteam

AUSTRALIA'S troubled Adelaide Steamship group was teetering last night after
its three main group companies abandoned a merger plan and confirmed that
there was 'little or no value for shareholders'.
The group's bankers are expected to go to the courts shortly to appoint an
administrator to oversee a bank-imposed reconstruction of the debt-plagued
group, which could take several years.
Mr David Crawford of audit group KPMG Peat Marwick, who has chaired the bank
committee negotiating with the group, is the likely appointment.
Adsteam has been trying to persuade its 110 banks owed over ADollars 6bn
(Dollars 4.6bn) for nearly five months to suspend interest and principal
debt payments until the end of 1991, pending the reconstruction.
All but one of the banks, a French bank owed about ADollars 7m by an
associate company, retailer David Jones, had agreed to the debt moratorium.
The banks face losses conservatively estimated at between ADollars 1bn and
ADollars 2bn should Adsteam be forced into liquidation. Australia's banks
are already under pressure following a spate of corporate collapses over the
past 18 months.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the audit group, had been conducting a valuation of the
group in preparation for the planned mergers, but this has been called off,
too.
The group and its advisers had planned to merge its holding company,
Adsteam, with David Jones and the Tooth brewing group to bring together
their respective 33 per cent shares in Industrial Equity, which controls the
profitable retailer, Woolworth's.
IEL has been subject to strict bank lending covenants since it was acquired
by Adsteam in a ADollars 1.7bn takeover by the three companies in a joint
venture in 1989. The loan agreements prevented any cash flowing from IEL to
its parent companies.
In separate announcements yesterday, Adsteam and David Jones said they
planned to float or sell their operating businesses, the main asset being
the upmarket David Jones retail chain.
The fate of Woolworth's was not known last night, but its managing director,
Mr Paul Simons, has been urging group banks and the boards of the three
companies controlling IEL to refloat the retailer on the stock exchange.
Adsteam's surprise statements yesterday came a month after the group
companies revealed losses totalling ADollars 3.7bn for the six months to
December 31, primarily due to write-downs in the values of complex group
cross-holdings.
At the time of the release of the interim results, the Adsteam board
announced the 'termination' of Mr John Spalvins, managing director, who
built the group into a feared corporate raider before falling foul of last
year's steep rise in interest rates.
Adsteam's last takeover was of Camford Engineering, the UK motor parts
producer, which was completed just as Adsteam began to experience cash-flow
difficulties.

FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Textiles setback as Jerome falls to Pounds
0.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARPLY LOWER profits from its textile operations and a substantially higher
interest charge led to 'very disappointing' annual profits at S Jerome, the
West Yorkshire-based yarn and electronics group. The final dividend is
passed.
Mr Alan Jerome, chairman, warned that no improvement was likely in the first
half of the current year.
The shares dipped to 57p on the announcement but staged a recovery to close
6p down on balance at 62p.
Taxable profits for 1990 slumped to just Pounds 105,000, against Pounds
1.58m previously. The latest figure was struck after exceptional charges of
Pounds 411,000 relating to wool prices - the Australian government reduced
the floor price by 20 per cent in May 1990 - and the Gulf war which
prevented shipments to Middle Eastern countries.
Interest charges totalled Pounds 910,000, up from Pounds 643,000 last time.
According to Mr Jerome, the increase reflected the need for higher
borrowings to finance the completion of the group's long-running capital
expenditure programme and provide increased working capital for the
electronics side.
That division increased operating profits by 38 per cent to Pounds 647,000
(Pounds 469,000), an advance achieved on turnover of Pounds 12.1m (Pounds
7.84m). The order book was 'greatly increased,' Mr Jerome said, and its
market share continues to grow.
In contrast, the textile side saw operating profits tumble from Pounds 1.8m
to Pounds 779,000 on turnover marginally down at Pounds 25.72m (Pounds
26.29m). Mr Jerome anticipated a recovery to get under way in the second
half.
Earnings per share emerged at 1.1p (14.1p). The total distribution for the
year - the interim of 2.6p - compares with payments of 8.4p in 1989.

FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Royal Bank tumbles to Pounds 72.4m halfway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL Bank of Scotland suffered a 58 per cent fall in taxable profits in
the first half of its financial year after more than doubling provisions for
bad debts.
Mr George Younger, the former Tory minister who recently took over as
chairman of the Edinburgh-based group, said yesterday that recession in the
UK and the US, coupled with the Gulf war, had had 'a severe adverse impact
on our performance'.
Tough conditions had forced up the number of bad loans. Meanwhile new income
was proving difficult to generate, and inflation was pushing up costs.
However, Mr Younger stressed that the group remained strongly capitalised,
and that it was well placed to benefit from any recovery, of which there
were at the moment only distant glimmerings.
The Royal Bank made Pounds 72.4m before tax in the six months to March 31,
down from Pounds 173.6m the year before. This was after provisions of Pounds
126.8m for bad debts.
Most parts of the group were affected. The clearing bank's contribution was
cut to Pounds 76m (Pounds 149.8m). This included a poor result from RoyScot,
the finance company which is now incorporated in the bank following a recent
reorganisation.
Charterhouse, the merchant banking arm, made Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 21.1m)
after provisions against deteriorating loans and investments. Direct Line,
the insurance company, raised profits to Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 3.5m) as it
continued to increase its share of the market.
In the US, Citizens Financial, the group's banking subsidiary, saw profits
fall to Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 11.8m) because of the severe downturn in the New
England banking market, and one-off acquisition costs.
The interim dividend is unchanged at 2.8p, payable from earnings per share
of 6.1p (14.1p).
The balance sheet expanded by 9 per cent to Pounds 32.2bn, and the
risk:asset ratio declined to 11.1 (11.6) per cent at September 30 1990,
though this was comfortably above the 8 per cent minimum.
The cost:income ratio deteriorated from 60.7 to 64.9 per cent, both because
of weaker income and rising costs. Mr Charles Winter, chief executive, said
that cost containment remained a high priority.
He described current banking conditions as among the worst in recent
history, with little prospect of early recovery.

FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Bank of Scotland declines 31% - Bad debts
provisions knock large dents in pre-tax figures north of the border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Scotland's results, accompanying news of a rights issue, bore
the marks of the UK recession.
Pre-tax profits in the year ending February 28 were Pounds 134.1m, down 31
per cent from Pounds 193.5m the year before. The main culprit was provisions
for bad debts which rose sharply to Pounds 202.3m (Pounds 90.4m).
However, Mr Bruce Pattullo, group chief executive, stressed that the group's
operating profit before provisions continued to increase, from Pounds 305.4m
to Pounds 339.4m, pointing to the underlying momentum of the business.
The proposed final dividend is unchanged at 3.1p. But following a sharp rise
in the interim dividend to create a better balance between the two payments,
the dividend for the year is up 12 per cent at 5.1p.
The operating profit of the clearing bank within the group rose to Pounds
224.9m (Pounds 218.6m) before bad debt provisions despite what it called
'extremely difficult economic conditions'. Average sterling lending grew by
23 per cent as the bank continued to increase its share of the market.
Margins also widened, particularly among blue-chip borrowers. There was also
a 32 per cent rise to Pounds 3.7bn in mortgage lending, which is now the
largest single component of the loan portfolio.
The greatest loan difficulties were experienced in the English market, into
which the Bank of Scotland has been expanding in recent years from its
Edinburgh base. Mr Pattullo acknowledged the irony in this, but he still
believed the strategy to be correct.
Among the subsidiaries, NWS Bank, the finance house, raised profits sharply
to Pounds 48.1m (Pounds 38m), thanks mainly to its policy of insulating
itself against interest rate changes. The British Linen Bank, the merchant
banking arm, saw profits fall from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 6m in a difficult
market.
Bank of Wales saw profits more than halved to Pounds 511,000 (Pounds 1.2m).
The Bank of Scotland is proposing to buy out the minority shareholders who
own 25 per cent of the bank. Yesterday it made an offer, recommended by the
independent directors of the Bank of Wales, at 70p cash per share, which
values the minority at Pounds 5.48m.
The Bank of Scotland group's operating expenses rose a sharp 19 per cent,
mainly because of higher salaries and an enlarged staff, as well as reduced
income from non-performing loans. This helped push the bank's cost:income
ratio up from 53 to 55 per cent. Mr Pattullo believes the ratio can be
reduced to below 50 per cent within three years.

FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Recovery from Queensway debacle buoys
Silentnight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Silentnight Holdings jumped by more than 20 per cent after the
UK's largest manufacturer of beds surprised the market with the strength of
its recovery from a disastrous distribution link with Lowndes Queensway.
The group reported a 56 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds
7.39m to Pounds 11.52m, in the year to February 2. Turnover was 5 per cent
down at Pounds 151.8m (Pounds 159.27m), because of the sale of the
upholstery division, but sales of the ongoing business were 5 per cent
higher at Pounds 133m (Pounds 127.3m).
Earnings per share increased to 16.71p (10.79p). An increased final dividend
of 4.75p (2.75p) gives a total for the year of 7p (5p).
Silentnight lost several millions in the deal with Lowndes Queensway, the
furniture and carpet retailer which collapsed last summer. However, the bed
group had ceased supplying Lowndes Queensway months before and said it had
incurred no bad debts as a result of the crash.
Mr Bill Davies, executive chairman, said the results 'were achieved in a
year which saw many companies in our sector falter as a result of the
recession in the UK economy. Indeed we believe we have increased our market
share at the expense of less financially sound competitors.'
Silentnight Beds did not fully recover volume lost because of severing the
Lowndes Queensway connection, but profits were increased by restructuring
the business and concentrating on higher margin products.
The most spectacular performance came from the cabinet furniture division,
which increased sales by 31 per cent to Pounds 26.42m following investment
in more sophisticated plant.
The increased strength of the pound also reduced the results of the group's
international division, which saw sales fall 5 per cent to Pounds 20.19m.
The United Arab Emirates subsidiary had a difficult year, because of the
Gulf war, but remained profitable.
COMMENT
The 28p jump in Silentnight's shares to 153p impressed analysts, although
they were also irritated that they had swallowed the new management's very
downbeat line on profits prospects. These figures show Silentnight has
bounced back from the Lowndes Queensway debacle and increased margins on
relatively flat sales - no small achievement in the present recession. It
also seems to have discovered a lucrative niche in English-style cabinets.
Even though it will invest Pounds 4m in the cabinet division out of total
capital expenditure of Pounds 10m in the current year, the company will
still not spend all its current cash pile of Pounds 13m. Forecast earnings
of at least Pounds 12.5m put it on a prospective multiple of just over 8.
Having risen from 80p in January, the shares may now take a rest, but they
still do not seem overvalued and look a sound long-term hold. They are are
also underpinned at that level by a prospective yield of 7 per cent.

FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: The calling of leasing profits to account -
Philip Coggan analyses the DTI's report on the 1988 collapse of Sound
Diffusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE of Sound Diffusion in December 1988 may have come as a big
surprise to its shareholders, but the company's problems, as yesterday's
Department of Trade &amp; Industry report made clear, had been developing over
several years.
What had been one of the most successful stock market companies in the early
1980s finished up in such a bad state that the liquidators estimate that no
funds will be available to general creditors or shareholders.
The report criticises the two auditors of the company over this period -
Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur Young (since merged as Ernst &amp; Young) - for
failing to identify, or otherwise accepting, serious defects in the
company's accounting practices.
The business of the group - leasing electrical equipment to hotels and
nursing homes - is a field where the accountancy issues are particularly
arcane. The report weighs in at 255 pages and there is a 33-page chapter
devoted entirely to the intricacies of lease accounting.
In essence, the inspectors conclude that the company made over-optimistic
assumptions on future leasing profits. When these profits failed to
materialise, and the company's trading position deteriorated, the board's
efforts to rescue the company came too late.
'In effect, the company was being squeezed from two directions,' say the
inspectors. 'The supply of new customer leases was falling, which affected
the ability to raise finance, and the cash strain arising from the existing
lease book was increasing.'
The last few years of the group's life were dogged by the question of how
much profit the group should recognise, and how quickly. Sound Diffusion's
founder, Mr Paul Stonor, left the group after a shareholder revolt caused by
a dispute with the auditors and the announcement of poor results after a
series of optimistic company profit forecasts.
Mr David Macdonald, Mr Stonor's replacement as chairman, restated the
accounts in several respects, but still, according to the inspectors, the
figures were over-optimistic.
Leasing appears simple enough on the surface. One company allows another to
use equipment, in return for a stream of rental payments. But such a system,
called an operating lease, requires the leasing company to make an upfront
payment and then wait for several years to recoup its money. That is very
bad for its cashflow.
So Sound Diffusion, like many other companies, sold its leasing agreement to
a finance company in return for an upfront payment. These so-called finance
leases were better - at least initially - for the company's cashflow but
were far more complex in accounting terms.
Under the terms of SSAP 21, the accounting rule covering this field of
operations, the profits should be spread over the whole of the lease period.
However, as a manufacturer of some of the products, Sound Diffusion was
entitled to recognise a 'selling profit' at the start of the lease. Given
that the leases could last as long as 14 years, the more profit that could
be reported early, the better for the company.
Determining this 'selling profit' was thus the root of much of the
accounting disputes, and a key element of the inspectors' criticisms of
Sound Diffusion's accounts. They conclude that 'excessive selling profits
were recognised in the accounts at the inception of finance leases'.
SSAP 21 says that the selling profit should be restricted to the excess of
the 'fair value' of the relevant asset over its cost, this 'fair value'
being the price at which an asset could be exchanged in an arms-length
transaction.
However, Sound Diffusion claimed, under both Mr Stonor and the replacement
board, that it was impossible that such a fair value could be established.
Instead, the company, in essence, calculated the figure backwards. It
calculated all the costs of the lease, added in an expected rate of return
over the lease's lifetime, and subtracted it from the expected revenues. The
result was the selling profit.
Much of the inspectors' report consists of criticism of these calculations.
For example, the company included in the lease an escalation clause, which
increased lease payments in line with wage inflation.
The effect of this was that the higher the assumed rate of wage inflation,
the higher the selling profit.
The inspectors criticise the assumed level of rental escalation and also say
that the company did not allow sufficiently for the effect of cancelled
leases. Nor did it adequately discount future rental income, or allow enough
for funding costs.
This not only meant that profits were recognised incorrectly but that the
company's principal assets on the balance sheet - its finance leases - were
inflated. 'We have concluded that the company's balance sheet at December 31
1987 was so materially overstated,' say the inspectors, 'that rather than
the net assets shown of Pounds 17.8m, there were actually net liabilities.'
These accounts were particularly important because they accompanied the
documents for the company's Pounds 9.5m rights issue. By this time, the
report says that, without additional capital, 'Sound Diffusion could not
have operated for much longer within its existing bank facilities'. The
inspectors say that 'had there been a proper analysis of the company's
position in these documents, it is inconceivable that the rights issue would
have proceeded'.
The inspectors criticise Mr Macdonald, and his fellow director Mr Francis
Howard, for their part in the rights issue documents saying that they
'failed to ensure that the reasons for the rights issue were stated
sufficiently clearly', and that they 'should not have been party to the
wording in the document to the effect that the problems of the past were
behind the company when they should have known this was not the case'.
Small shareholders were vociferous in their complaints about the wording of
the rights issue document when the company collapsed. But Mr Macdonald and
Mr Howard yesterday rejected the inspectors' criticisms, arguing that it is
'rather surprising' that it is they, rather than the experts, who are
singled out for criticism over the rights issue.
The inspectors did say that 'no single factor or person was responsible for
the failure of Sound Diffusion', and Ernst &amp; Young reacted sharply to the
report yesterday, saying that the accountancy issue in question was a matter
of judgment and that it continued to believe the policies used were
appropriate.
The row is unlikely to end with the report. Tunstall Group, a major
shareholder in Sound Diffusion, is suing Arthur Young, claiming damages for
negligence and/or breach of duty in connection with the 1987 accounts and
the rights issue document. The action has been set down for trial in July
next year.

FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Growth at Fenner ends as profits halve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FENNER, the diversified Hull-based manufacturing and distribution group,
yesterday announced an abrupt end to a period of sustained growth with
first-half pre-tax profits nearly halved from Pounds 7.26m to Pounds 3.71m.
The fall prompted a 4p decline to 132p in the share price, and underlines
the severity and suddenness of the recession which hit UK heavy
manufacturing last autumn. Profits in the last full year to end-September
rose 21 per cent to Pounds 16.1m, but analysts now expect the total for the
current year to be about Pounds 8.5m-Pounds 9m.
Turnover for the first half ended March 2 slipped from Pounds 102.5m to
Pounds 100.5m.
Despite the profit fall the interim is held at 3.45p. Mr Peter Barker,
chairman, said this reflected 'the underlying strengths of our various
businesses and our confidence in measures taken.' Fenner has cut about 15
per cent of its UK workforce, or 350 jobs, in the current year.
Fenner said UK results were affected by destocking and sharp reduction in
demand, particularly in power transmission engineering manufacture. Other
sectors, such as fluid power and conveyer belts, fared better.
Overseas operations increased profits modestly, despite a worldwide
recession, a strong pound and high interest rates. The group's recently
acquired controlling stake in Hong Kong-based Contimach is expected to help
the company address strong Far Eastern competition in power equipment
through low-cost sourcing.
Mr Barker said 'signs are apparent that demand levels are now stabilising,'
but the economic recovery widely forecast for the latter part of 1991 was
unlikely to come in time to influence the group's performance in the current
year.
Mr Barker said Fenner was 'running the rule' over six potential acquisitions
in the UK and overseas, one of which in particular looked very attractive.
He said the job cuts would produce extraordinary provisions of about Pounds
6m in the current year, although the cash impact would be about Pounds 1m.

FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Pounds 3.6m rights as Cussins returns to
its roots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSSINS PROPERTY Group is to retreat from housebuilding in the south of
England and from commercial property activities in a restructuring and
refinancing program.
The north of England-based group is terminating Cussins Green, the
loss-making joint venture with Throgmorton Trust through which it entered
the housebuilding market in southern England and selling its commercial
property interests.
''We'll be a smaller company, but we are really going back to our roots,'
commented Mr Peter Cussins, chairman.
The group has also agreed a refinancing package with Lloyds Bank, providing
an overdraft facility of Pounds 14.25m.
In addition, it is raising some Pounds 3.6m through a 1-for-1 rights issue
of 7.13m new ordinary shares at 55p apiece.
The news accompanied results for 1990 which showed a loss of Pounds 4.04m
(pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.75m), due largely to its share of losses at the
joint venture of Pounds 8.06m (Pounds 1.94m).
Turnover was Pounds 21.84m (Pounds 22.49m). Losses per share were 57.8p
(earnings 26.2p) and the final is passed (5.5p), making 3.75p (9.25p).

FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Budgens revamp team finds the odds stacked
high - The muted response to board changes at the high street grocer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN institutional shareholders yesterday successfully ushered a turn-round
team on to the board of Budgens, the troubled high street grocery chain, and
forced the resignation of Mr John Fletcher as chairman, they might have
hoped for a more enthusiastic response from the market.
Mr Fletcher's removal and the installation of Mr John von Spreckelsen, the
new chief executive, was followed by an 11 per cent fall in the share price
rather than a surge of optimism that sometimes greets the arrival of fresh
talent.
Uncertainty remains because Mr Fletcher's compensation for early termination
of his five-year contract and the new team's remuneration are still to be
decided by the new non-executive directors.
But there is deeper concern that Mr von Spreckelsen and the institutions
Electra, IEP and Gartmore - who in a rare victory managed to oust a sitting
board without making a full bid for the company - may have underestimated
the problems in Budgens' trolley.
Not least of these is a growing feeling among food retail experts that
Budgens is on the wrong end of long-term structural changes in UK food
retailing.
Increasingly aggressive store development from the likes of Tesco, which
earlier this year raised Pounds 572m in a rights issue to keep its momentum
going, could well put Budgens under intolerable pressure, some analysts say.
The company's immediate problem remains its balance sheet. Problems with the
launch of its new distribution depot at Wellingborough, Northants, in 1989
have left Budgens highly geared on its 94 stores and head office in Ruislip,
London.
The sale of 51 stores to Betta Stores last May reduced the debt to Pounds
30m and gearing to about 50 per cent. But any more store disposals moves the
company further away from the critical volume that it needs to defray
overheads at Wellingborough.
That plant was designed with capacity for Pounds 370m of retail sales, but
is only operating at 65 per cent of this, including space leased to Betta
Stores, according to Mr Fletcher.
The poor property market has meant that a plan to move the head office from
Ruislip, freeing up 10 acres of freehold property, has been deferred and
most of the buildings are on short-term let.
More fundamentally, food retailing experts question the concept of the
Budgens-style convenience store in the high street supplying shoppers
between their major weekly visits to the out-of-town superstores.
Apart from Cullens and corner shop owner-operators no one has made a success
of this business. And if anything the competition is getting stiffer from
the superstores.
New check-out computer systems have armed Tesco and J Sainsbury with far
more immediate knowledge of what the consumer wants. Their sophisticated
distribution networks have also removed the need for each branch to carry
large stocks in warehouses.
As a result they are increasingly moving towards just-in-time delivery, not
only at the superstores but also at the smaller high street stores and are
increasing their ratio of shelf to warehouse space.
High street shops which Tesco and J Sainsbury had placed lower on their
priority lists are now being revamped and are attacking the niche Budgens
was trying to develop.
They have the added advantage of commanding the kind of brand loyalty and
franchise strength that Budgens has only been able to dream about in recent
years.
Budgens is also unlikely ever to be able to compete with the superstores
head on. It pays higher rents in the centre of towns and it buys from
manufacturers on far less favourable terms than its large out of town
competitors.
Mr von Spreckelsen embarked yesterday on a top to toe review of the
business. He will be trying to translate the experience he gained turning
around Kafu Wasmund, the Bremen-based supermarket chain with 280 stores in
1989, and before that with Bowater Freight Services.
He will be relying heavily on Mr Clark who put in 19 years with Tesco and a
further five with Asda. Mr Clark said yesterday that until the board changes
Budgens had hoped to open more stores rather than close them, but that the
review would not rule out closures.
The review is likely to recommend further efforts to dispose of the Ruislip
property and will probably aim to develop greater liaison with other
convenience stores to raise capacity utilisation at Wellingborough.
The trouble with food retailing is that unless stores are being opened,
rather than closed as Budgens' balance sheet probably demands, there is
little chance of the business growing.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bidder for Merlin International Properties and his financial adviser,
Fininvest, have been censured by the Takeover Panel for failing to ensure
that the necessary funds would be available.
The Pounds 2.9m bid, subsequently withdrawn, was made by newly-formed Luirc,
based offshore and owned by Swiss-based Estonia Venture. The money was
supposed to come via a loan from Bonaventure Investments, another offshore
concern.
The panel has criticised Mr Arthur Oaks, Luirc's UK representative, and
Fininvest. It said no announcement should have been made before Fininvest
had received an irrevocable commitment from Bonaventure to provide funds.
General Principle 3 had been offended, which says offers should only be
announced when the bidder is sure it can implement the offer. The principle
also attaches responsibility to the financial adviser.
The panel stressed that particular care was needed 'when a financial adviser
is acting for a newly created offeror, such as an off-the-shelf overseas
company.'

FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: MFI reschedules Pounds 15m of its debt
repayment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MFI, the furniture manufacturer and retailer, is delaying the repayment of
Pounds 15m of its debt for a year because of the continuing difficult
trading conditions on the high street.
The company, which staged a Pounds 718m leveraged buy-out in 1987, agreed
with its bankers that it would be more appropriate to preserve funds within
the business in view of the economic climate.
MFI has also extended its working capital facilities of Pounds 30m by a year
to November 1993 but will continue to pay in full all the interest costs on
its bank loans.
Mr John Randall, finance director, said yesterday: 'We could afford to make
the payment out of cash flow but we and our bankers did not think the
climate was right. It is not prudent to do so until we know that trading has
turned.'
The decision nevertheless raised some eyebrows in the City since the company
had stated that it had no need of additional funds when it announced its
interim results in February.
Mr Paul Smiddy, retailing analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said: 'We were not
expecting MFI to do a rescheduling so it is a slight surprise but we do not
have any worries about the durability of the company.'
In total, MFI still has Pounds 475m in debts still outstanding. The company
is now due to repay Pounds 15m of debt in April 1992, a further Pounds 25m
in October of that year, and Pounds 30m in April 1993.
The vast bulk of the debt will not be paid off until the company is
refloated on the stock market, a prospect that recedes further into the
distance as long as the difficult trading conditions persist.
Mr Randall said he thought any flotation would be at least three years away.
MFI said that results for the year to April 27 would show a substantial
operating profit, although they would be below last year's Pounds 55m.
Trading conditions in the second half of the year had been poor, but the
company said it still faced the new financial year confidently.
The rescheduling of the debt will lead to a slight increase in the company's
financing charges.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Whittaker sells Ship Canal stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Whittaker, the northern property developer, is selling his family's
68 per cent interest in Manchester Ship Canal to Peel Holdings, the quoted
property company in which he already has a 47 per cent stake.
The Pounds 79m cash and shares deal will give Mr Whittaker majority control
of Peel and bolsters Peel's balance sheet which has been battered by
property revaluations.
Without the transaction Peel's gearing would have risen to 133 per cent,
breaching a bank lending covenant of 125 per cent. Mr Whittaker feared some
members of a 20-bank consortium would have wanted unacceptable conditions to
renegotiate Peel's debt.
Although Peel has cash of Pounds 109m from Pounds 200m of property sales in
the past 12 months, it has Pounds 336m of debts. The cash and shares deal
for the ship canal, of which Mr Whittaker won control after a bitter
three-year takeover battle in 1987, will increase debts to Pounds 390m but
lower gearing to 108 per cent.
Peel will pay Largs, Mr Whittaker's private group, Pounds 79m, of which
Pounds 22.7m will be deferred one year, Pounds 40m will be paid in cash and
the balance in 4.5m new Peel ordinary shares and 20m new convertible
preference shares. Mr Whittaker's holding in Peel will rise to 50.3 per
cent.
Mr Peter Scott, Peel's managing director, said yesterday: 'If you are
issuing equity these days you have to acquire something with growth
potential. The Ship Canal owns more than 6,000 acres of land, including a
304-acre site at Dumplington where a 1m sq ft regional shopping centre is
planned.'
Dumplington, on the western edge of Trafford Park in Greater Manchester, is
at the nexus of five motorways and the A580 East Lancashire road. Following
a public inquiry, the government has pronounced in favour of the development
but formal planning permission has yet to be granted.
Whittaker interests own nearly all the Ship Canal's 4m preferred shares and
about 2.5m of its 4m ordinary shares.
The balance of the latter are held by Mr Nicholas Berry, who chaired the
final stages of the takeover defence, the National Coal Board, Prudential
Assurance, the Water Authorities' Pension Fund and 2,000 small shareholders.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Taking a gamble on BSkyB blockbuster deal: A look at the
consortium's hopes for the satellite venture after yesterday's financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Frank Barlow talks about just how much money he believes British Sky
Broadcasting is going to make, he instinctively lowers his voice in case
anybody should overhear.
Has another hard-headed executive - in this case, the new chairman of the
Pounds 1.4bn satellite television venture - succumbed to the lure of
television and begun seeing imaginary crocks of gold?
Mr Barlow, who is also chief operating officer of Pearson, which publishes
the Financial Times, and his chairman, Lord Blakenham, are increasing the
group's BSkyB stake to 16 per cent as part of a Pounds 200m financing agreed
yesterday.
Mr Peter Davis, chairman and chief executive of Reed International, is an
equally hard-headed businessman who has concentrated Reed's focus on
publishing and information. However, Mr Davis and the Reed board have
decided not to participate in the financing, diluting the company's BSkyB
stake from 10 to 3.7 per cent - although the group has more than Pounds 180m
in equity, guarantees and loans still riding on the five-channel consortium.
Mr Barlow and Mr Davis cannot both be right. If BSkyB, as Mr Barlow
believes, will be making several hundred million pounds a year profit within
the foreseeable future, then Reed's decision - the unanimous view of the
board - will in time prove overly cautious.
Yet, on the face of it, Mr Davis would seem to have a strong case for not
throwing good money after bad. Since the merger of British Satellite
Broadcasting and Mr Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television last November, combined
losses have fallen from Pounds 9.7m a week. But they are still running at
Pounds 6m a week - Pounds 3m in operating costs and Pounds 3m in financing
charges. The consortium, which is probably bringing in revenues of about
Pounds 100m a year, has still to reach its target of an annual cost base of
Pounds 280m compared with the combined Pounds 590m at the time of the
merger.
The Pounds 200m new money is needed to take BSkyB to the end of 1992, still
some way short of the publicly stated break-even point in 1993. There could
be, as Reed fears, further calls on cash.
Raising the money has not been easy for some other BSkyB shareholders.
Pearson and Chargeurs, the French transport and communication company, are
taking up the slack left by Reed. Granada, the television, leisure, and
computer services group, will put in its share, about Pounds 25m. However,
the company is under pressure from institutional shareholders because of its
exposure to BSkyB and a Pounds 200m foray into the computer services
industry.
Mr Rupert Murdoch, fresh from a more than Dollars 7bn refinancing for his
News Corporation, cannot easily put his hands on the Pounds 100m he needs to
keep his end up. It is a measure of Mr Murdoch's commitment to satellite
television and his determination that future profits should not be diluted
that he has scraped together a package of cash and value, including film
rights, to meet his commitment.
'BSkyB is an uneasy alliance of competitors; a marriage of News
Corporation's operational management skills with the financial resources of
BSB's major shareholders. Without both contributing to its future, BSkyB
will fail,' argues Mr Terry Povey, analyst with stockbrokers ANZ McCaughan,
who has made a detailed study of the satellite venture.
But what sort of horse is it that apparently sensible people are putting
their money on? BSkyB is, in effect, a subscription television film
monopoly. Two of its five channels show only films and can only be seen by
those who pay Pounds 9.99 a month for one, or Pounds 14.99 for two. The
consortium has exclusive UK pay television deals with all the leading
Hollywood studios and subscribers also get access to main sporting events.
The BSkyB package also includes general entertainment and news channels.
BSkyB channels are now available to about 2m UK homes through individual
dishes or cable networks. An advertising campaign and special offers are
boosting sales to 75,000 a month. More than 60 per cent of satellite viewers
are also film channel subscribers.
Recent market research for Satellite Finance, a specialist FT newsletter,
forecasts that 54 per cent of existing film channel subscribers will buy the
two-station, Pounds 14.99 package and 22 per cent have already contracted to
do so.
Home Box Office in the US and Canal Plus in France have already proved that
pay television based on films can be a serious business. If Mr Sam Chisholm,
BSkyB's tough managing director, can get costs down, if the business is not
crippled by law suits from manufacturers left holding BSB's squarials and
the shareholders keep their nerve, UK pay television might become an equally
serious business.
Continental Research group forecasts that by the end of the century 7m of
the UK's 21m homes will have a satellite dish - not counting cable
connections. It also predicts that ITV's share of television advertising
will fall from 83 per cent to 70 per cent, with the Sky One channel taking a
10 per cent share.
Independent analysts have created financial models for BSkyB's longer-term
future, if it overcomes its short-term difficulties.
ANZ, which based its scenario on an average growth of 40,000 dishes a month,
forecasts an annual net cash inflow of Pounds 1.18bn by the year 2000 for
BSkyB.
A computer model constructed by European Media Business &amp; Finance, a new
specialist publication, predicts operating profits of Pounds 375m a year by
1995, with dividends coming on stream by 1998.
Finally, a study by Zenith Media Worldwide estimates that almost 40 per cent
of UK homes will have satellite dishes by 2000.
If those forecasts are even nearly right, BSkyB executives may yet be able
to smoke the large cigars of genuine television moguls.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Shell in big Gulf of Mexico find
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHELL OIL, the US arm of the multinational Royal Dutch/Shell group,
announced an important oil discovery yesterday in the Gulf of Mexico which
could contain as much as 1bn barrels of oil. The discovery is the biggest
made in the US for 20 years, opening up the potential of the Gulf region
which the industry believes could become another North Sea. The Mars
discovery is at a depth of 3,100 feet which will make it one of the deepest
commercially-viable oilfields in the world if the decision is taken to
develop it. The only other field of this depth under development is Shell's
Auger operation nearby. Shell said that further engineering studies are
required before it can estimate the full size of the find, but industry
observers believe it to rank among the world's 'giant' finds which contain
1bn barrels of oil or more. The largest oilfield in the UK's sector of the
North Sea is the Forties field which is estimated to contain 2.5bn barrels.
Oil could come into production at Shell's Mars discovery within five years
of starting development, the company said yesterday. British Petroleum has a
one-third interest in the Mars field and the company said it was
'potentially the biggest prospect in which the company has participated
since the discovery of its major North Sea fields'. Mr John Browne, head of
exploration at BP, said the find 'obviously has great significance for the
industry because it is the first time an operator has announced a discovery
at these depths'. The depth of the water in the Gulf of Mexico - North Sea
fields are 600 to 700 feet deep - makes it a more complicated and expensive
discovery to develop, requiring the latest oilfield technology. One industry
expert estimates that costs could be double those of the North Sea where it
costs about Dollars 3.40 to produce a barrel of oil. But tax rates on oil
revenue in the US are much lower than those in the UK and the discoveries
will be more profitable.
The development of deep-sea technology to exploit these oil finds has
implications for the so-called 'frontier' area of the North Sea, west of
Shetland, where exploration could begin in several years time.

FT  02 MAY 91 / NUT rejects a boycott of testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIMARY school teachers yesterday overwhelmingly rejected a boycott of
standard assessment tests for seven-year-olds in a ballot conducted by the
National Union of Teachers.
The result removes the threat of widespread disruption in primary schools
after a ballot was proposed at the NUT conference in Scarborough last month.
Standard assessment tasks (SATs) are already in progress in schools.
Only 968 primary school teachers voted for a boycott, with 6,939 (88 per
cent) against. The turnout was about 65 per cent.
A separate ballot of all NUT members showed 86 per cent of those voting to
be in favour of a national campaign against testing (44,623 to 7,310).
However, only 27 per cent of NUT members voted, and the campaign is to be
limited to lobbying parents, head teachers and school governors, and will
not include industrial action.
Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said: 'The decision not to boycott
tests this year should not be taken as indicating any weakening in our
resolve to achieve the abolition of these tests.'
Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, welcomed the ballot result, and
added: 'As I have made clear, we will look closely at the experience of
administering the tests this year to see whether they need to be made
simpler.'
The vote by the NUT, the largest teachers' union in England and Wales,
clears the way for legislation covering the government's proposed review
body for teachers' pay, currently before the House of Commons.
Mr Clarke has made establishment of the body conditional upon the teaching
unions not resorting to strike action.
None of the five other teaching unions has expressed support for a boycott
of testing.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Polls seen as test of national strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOTERS go to the polls in local elections across England and Wales today for
what will almost certainly be the last significant test of strength for the
political parties before a general election.
With less than 15 months to go before a full election must be called,
balloting for more than 12,000 council seats in 475 constituencies will be
analysed minutely for its likely bearing on a national poll.
No voting will take place in Scotland or London, but it was strong
Conservative showings at similar local elections in 1983 and 1987 that
persuaded the government to go quickly to the country to seek fresh
mandates.
On both occasions the Tories won handsome majorities in the House of
Commons.
This time politicians of all parties believe the Conservatives are highly
unlikely to do well enough for Mr John Major, the prime minister, to risk
calling an immediate poll.
With widespread concern over the economy, two recent by-election defeats and
continuing debate over the reform of the poll tax, the Tories are braced to
lose a substantial number of the 5,200 council seats they took on a wave of
popularity four years ago.
Opinion polls show Labour level-pegging with the government on about 40 per
cent of the vote, up from 31 per cent in 1987, and a near halving of the
Liberal Democrats support to about 14 per cent.
One Labour official said yesterday: 'A crucial factor will be how the old
(Social Democrat-Liberal) Alliance votes go, with us hoping for them to get
a rising vote in the south and a falling one in the north.'
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrats' leader, predicted that his party
would control more councils after the voting even though it was likely to
lose seats after its strong performance last time.
Mr Major said yesterday that membership of the European exchange rate
mechanism and the end of a lending surge provoked by financial deregulation
meant Britain was 'better equipped than ever before' to prevent a resurgence
of inflation.

THE DAISY CHAIN: HOW BORROWED BILLIONS SANK A TEXAS S&amp;L By James O'Shea
Pocket Books, Dollars 19.95, 351 pages
THE GREATEST-EVER BANK ROBBERY: THE COLLAPSE OF THE SAVINGS AND LOAN
INDUSTRY By Martin Mayer Scribners, Dollars 24.95, 354 pages
Imagine more than a dozen financial scandals with the notoriety of the
Guinness affair, and involving the write-off of a third of the assets of the
building societies: you then have an inkling of the scale of the US savings
and loan disaster. It is the largest financial collapse - and taxpayer
rescue - in modern times.
The story remains little known across the Atlantic. Perhaps it is because
savings and loans, also known as thrifts, are an unfamiliar, peculiarly
American institution. The very size of the losses may also be a turn-off.
Some numbers are just too big to grasp. The US taxpayer will have to provide
at least Dollars 150bn (Pounds 88bn) and probably more (at current prices
and ignoring cumulative interest costs), even though the direct economic
impact will be smaller since most of the money is a transfer from the
taxpayer to protect existing depositors.
The disaster is one of the most fascinating business stories of the past
generation. It touches much of American society. There are plenty of
villains: crooks using every known device in the history of fraud to plunder
savings and loans; lax members of top accounting and law firms willing to
bend rules in search of fat fees; greedy Wall Street securities houses
putting money wherever the return is highest; weak politicians looking for
campaign contributions; blinkered ideologues in the Reagan administration;
and ineffective regulators.
Thrifts, with their inherent mismatch between borrowing short and then
lending long at fixed rates, were at first protected by caps on interest
rates for deposits and mortgages. But they faced growing pressure in the
1970s as rates rose and money market funds were devised to compete with
them.
The much-criticised deregulation of a decade ago was a response to that
initial squeeze. First, interest rates were uncapped, then thrifts were
freed to raise and invest money where they wanted.
The real problem was the Federal government guarantee of deposits up to
Dollars 100,000. As thrifts shifted from mutual to joint-stock operation,
for a new generation of owners this was an irresistible invitation to gamble
with little risk as the taxpayer stood ready to pick up losses. The early
Reaganites never accepted that, with such a one-sided guarantee, prudent
supervision was necessary to accompany deregulation.
These two books are among the liveliest of more than a dozen recounting the
saga. At one level it is a morality tale of the pitfalls of deposit
insurance. Despite a condescending, know-it-all style, Martin Mayer
revealingly explains how a problem of unprofitability in the early 1980s
turned into one of insolvency by the end of the decade.
The saga is also an absorbing yarn in the manner of the tabloids. James
O'Shea exploits this to the full by concentrating on the rise and fall of
Vernon Savings of Dallas, Texas, which, under the guidance of Don Dixon,
boosted its deposits almost 20-fold in five years and collapsed with 96 per
cent of its loans being delinquent.
Vernon fully lived up to the Texan self-image of the American Dream taken to
often grotesque excess. Dixon believed in living well - witness his
'gastronomique fantastique' tour of France to do research for a
'world-class' restaurant in Dallas (part of what was dubbed the
rent-a-Frenchman programme). There were jets, luxury houses, collections of
luxury cars and guns, and the hiring of prostitutes. Vernon was not alone.
Stanley Adams, regarded as eccentric even by Texas standards, once applied
to the state regulator to open a branch on the moon, saying 'what the hell,
they laughed at Da Vinci too'.
Vernon was rated one of the most profitable US thrifts. Something was
obviously wrong. Vernon was exploiting to the full, and beyond, lax
accounting rules about what it could declare as profits. Developers were
given loans well over the appraised value of a project to permit payment of
fees and interest. Losses were never written off and fictitious profits were
booked as a result of friendly 'dead horse for a dead cow' deals as dubious
projects were exchanged with fellow thrift owners in similar trouble.
When the oil price fell in the mid-1980s and the Texas property market went
sour, Vernon and other thrifts became engaged in desperate manoeuvring with
increasingly worried regulators in the hope of deferring the end. Friendly
politicians, to whom contributions had been made, were called in to help
persuade regulators to be sympathetic. In the similar case of Lincoln
Savings, Charles Keating donated more than Dollars 2m to five US senators in
the specific expectation that they would help him.
The resulting delays and some inept decisions by regulators raised the
losses, which for Vernon are likely to cost US taxpayers Dollars 1.3bn. Last
month Dixon received the lenient sentence of five years in prison for 23
counts of fraud and racketeering.
Amid all the retrospective hand-wringing, Congress is determined to avoid
making the same mistakes in the case of the banks. But there are big
differences in reform proposals. The US Treasury's plan for the banks
tightens, rather than relaxes, supervision and specifies that insured
deposits cannot be used in risky ventures. Yet many in Congress are
reluctant to contemplate sensible changes in banking structure, allowing a
wider range of activities which would attract more capital and avoid a
repetition of the savings and loan collapse. There is a risk that in
fighting the last war Congress may lose the current one.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Letter: Realities of Northern Ireland's sectarian divide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr GRAHAM GUDGIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Northern Ireland's unfavourable external image is often greatly
exaggerated and it is important not to contribute damaging impressions even
inadvertently. In their article on Northern Ireland ('A break in the Irish
mist', April 26) Ralph Atkins and Kieran Cooke, gave an impression of
sectarian division which is considerably greater than the true position.
It is not true, for instance, that only the edges have been chipped away
from segregation in jobs. Catholics comprise about 37 per cent of the labour
force and constitute 35 per cent of employees in occupations covered by the
1991 census conducted by the Fair Employment Commission. Excluding security
jobs, for which they tend not to apply, Catholics comprise 36.5 per cent of
employees: females appear to have more than a proportionate share of jobs,
while males are about 2.5 percentage points short of full proportionality.
Within this overall balance there is certainly a degree of segregation. This
is partly due to geography, but goes further than this. Even so, only 5 per
cent of companies have employees of a single denomination and most are
small. Less than 10 per cent of employees are in companies or workplaces
with more than 90 per cent one denomination.
Nor is it true that only 10 schools out of 450 take both Catholic and
Protestant children. The schools referred to are presumably integrated
schools. These multi-denominational Christian schools have increased
significantly in number, but are not the only mixed-intake schools.
The education system in Northern Ireland is the same as that in England in
that Catholic parents often prefer to send their children to Catholic
schools. Other, predominantly non-Catholic, children attend state schools.
However, Northern Ireland has a substantial number of educationally
excellent state grammar schools, and some Catholic parents prefer their
children to attend these. My own children's state school has 20 per cent of
Catholics among its intake.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Japanese cars and the EC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CLAIMS BY some members of the European Commission that its recent outline
proposals for limiting Japanese car sales are a victory for free-trade
principles indicate how far its deliberations have descended into
double-think. The most likely outcome will be to cushion inefficient
European carmakers and ensure windfall profits for Japanese producers at the
expense of EC consumers.
In the name of unifying the EC market, Brussels proposes to negotiate
'transitional' restraints on the growth of Japanese car sales in the five
countries where imports are currently subject to national curbs. The planned
controls, intended to last until 1998 or 1999, would be enforced by Japanese
'monitoring' of deliveries. It is hardly surprising that the Japanese see
benefits in such arrangements. EC controls would enable them to set higher
prices and earn fatter margins than if there were free competition. That is
what happened after Japanese carmakers agreed to voluntary restraints on
exports to the US in 1981.
If the EC wants to give its car industry time to adjust to competition, it
would be more sensible to negotiate a temporary increase in tariffs on car
imports, as it would be entitled to do by international trade rules. That
would, at least, ensure that the benefits of high prices went to the
Community rather than to the Japanese. It would also establish a formal
institutional mechanism - lacking from Brussels' proposals - for ending the
period of protection.
Implicit control
Why did Brussels not choose that option? Partly because the controls it is
contemplating will extend beyond imports to output from Japanese-owned
assembly 'transplants' inside the Community. That has not been made
explicit, if only because it would violate the Rome Treaty. Yet in practice
Brussels aims to include both sources of supply when it comes to fixing
precise limits on sales. If growth of shipments from one source threatened
to breach the overall ceiling, the Japanese would be expected to adjust by
reducing supplies from the other. In short, the EC is out to create a
cartel.
Some defenders of EC policy claim no great harm will be done, because the
eventual limits will reflect the 'natural' sales growth which the Japanese
would have achieved if the EC market were fully open. Apart from the
difficulty of second-guessing sales trends for the rest of the decade, the
argument begs the question of why the restrictions are needed at all.
Arbitrary proposals
The arbitrary nature of the proposals also invites other distortions and
uncertainties. Suppose Honda acquired full control of Rover, with which it
already collaborates on model development: would Rover's output then count
as 'Japanese' or as 'European'? How would the EC treat output from 50/50
joint ventures owned by Japanese and European partners?
It may be argued that, unsatisfactory as the EC's means are, they are
justified by its ends - a completely open car market before the end of the
decade. However, that pre-supposes either that the Commission will have the
courage to resist political pressure to extend the restrictions when they
are due to lapse; or that European carmakers will have improved their
competitive position so dramatically that they no longer require protection.
Events to date do not inspire great confidence in either assumption.
Independent analyses suggest that the efficiency of the European car
industry lags so far behind the Japanese that it will need many years of
effort to draw even. Furthermore, few European carmakers have built a broad
international sales base, rendering them exceptionally vulnerable to keener
Japanese competition in their home markets.
Japanese cars sell well because customers want to buy them. Continued
restrictions not only deny consumers choice and distort the allocation of
economic resources; all the evidence suggests that they would deprive
European producers of the most powerful incentive to take the painful
measures essential to their long-term survival.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Leading Article: A flawed referendum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TO JUDGE by the way the two larger parties have campaigned, today's local
elections are regarded by both the leader of the opposition and the prime
minister as a referendum, or super opinion poll, on whether the time is
right for Mr John Major to call a general election. There is a precedent for
this. The victories scored by Conservatives in the equivalent local contests
four years ago helped to convince Mrs Margaret Thatcher that June would be a
good time to go to the country.
The portents were right: the Conservatives won handsomely. Yet if a
judgement on the Tories' prospects of winning a fourth term in government
was all that was required the prime minister could make do with the far less
expensive series of sample polls available on a more or less continuous
basis. Local elections should be about more than that.
They do provide an opportunity to the electorate to hold local authorities
to account. Today more than 12,250 council seats will be contested in 296
district councils in England and 37 in Wales, as well as in the 36
all-purpose metropolitan authorities. London and Scotland are in a fallow
voting year, but this remains the biggest series of elections in the
four-year cycle of local contests. It is also among the most complicated: in
124 of the districts and in all the larger authorities only a third of the
incumbents must offer themselves for re-election each year.
Financial muddle
The complications extend beyond the generally opaque structure of local
administration. Finance is a worse muddle. Most potential voters will be
receiving Community Charge demands about now. The law provides that these
state the name of the precepting authority - that is, whether it is the
district, the county, the parish, or the borough. Citizens who possess
magnifying glasses and unlimited spare time, not to mention advanced
mathematical skills, may then calculate which council is responsible for
which portion of the poll tax.
This may be set against the individual's perception of the standard of
service provided for the money demanded - although that too will be
difficult if the unfortunate elector has not earned a degree in the
functions of local government and is therefore not precisely aware of which
service is the responsibility of which body. That hurdle surmounted, the
responsible local voter may then sit down to estimate how much local
expenditure is in fact locally financed and therefore likely to be affected
by her or his vote and how much is either a normal government grant or the
special Pounds 140 'vote Conservative' bribe proffered in the Budget.
Voter apathy
It is therefore hardly surprising that many voters do not bother to go to
the polling booth at all. If the average turnout today is 40 per cent or
more of the names on the registration lists the general verdict will be that
turnout has been pretty good. This is not to say that there is no element of
accountability. The expectation is that the Liberal Democrats, who have no
chance of becoming the next government, may score more heavily in votes cast
for them than they do in the current opinion polls. That implies that some
of the minority of voters who take part in local elections do draw a
distinction between local authorities and the standing of the parties
nationally.
This is not good enough. If Britain is to have a healthy local democracy it
must be accountable to those who vote for it. Both main parties now propose
to abolish county councils, which would be a useful simplification, but not
enough in itself. There must be a relationship between the provision of
services and their financing that the average voter can understand. The poll
tax was designed to achieve that; it failed.
In seeking a substitute the Liberal Democrats have proposed a local income
tax. Labour proposes that the local determination of business rates be
restored. But its proposals are heavily qualified. The Conservatives, by
restricting the future financing of local government to a single 'council
tax' that can encompass at best 11 per cent of costs, seem to have abandoned
the search for genuine accountability.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Arts: Josef Suk - Wigmore Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the bicentenary of Mozart's death, the centenary of Prokofiev's birth,
and the 150th anniversary of Antonn Dvorak's. The first is being celebrated
everywhere, the second has just been marked on the South Bank, and the
almost unsung third was sweetly commemorated at the Wigmore Hall on Tuesday
night with a recital devoted to his violin and piano music, performed by his
great-grandson Josef Suk and the fine pianist Gordon Back.
More momentous tributes to Dvorak's genius can easily be imagined - his
violin and piano pieces are distinctively minor, though generally enjoyable;
and there was something business-like about the concert - one piece tossed
off after another - that scarcely honoured him. Suk's blood-relationship
with him counted for little, as far as I could sense, in the way of
mystique; there was small sense of occasion.
But Suk is an absolutely sterling player, with a big, warm, assiduously
vibratoed sound and a masterful technique. There is an air of instant
accomplishment about his music-making, as though difficulties can't exist;
at the same time there is a slightly stifling uniformity about his
interpretations; he always seems to be moving between decisive despatch and
tearful intensity, without investigating intermediate shades of feeling. He
is the opposite of a mannered player.
The programme went backwards in time from the Four Romantic Pieces, Op. 75,
of 1887 (the third, with its contrast of flowing piano part and jerky violin
rhythm, commanded attention) to the brief, unusual Nocturne, Op. 40, begun
in 1875; then lurched forward for the final item, the well-beloved
unpretentious Sonatina in G, Op. 100, of 1893. The bubbling melodious appeal
of the latter (inescapeably nostalgic for anyone who learned the violin at
school) was all the more refreshing after the full-dress Sonata in F, Op. 57
(1880), which was given a sympathetic enough reading earlier (nice bravura
passage-work from Mr. Back at the end) but still seemed dutiful and dull.
The stormy section of the Ballade in D minor, Op. 15 (1884), found Suk in
splendidly vigorous form.

What do you feel about grasping your stubbie in one hand while using your

Floyd will explain all this when he shows how to fish for yabbies in South
Australia during today's episode of Floyd On Oz (8.00 BBC2).
This Week tells us about cartels in the building materials business which
supply public works projects, with Pounds 60m a year of excess profits going
to concrete companies alone, all from your pocket and mine of course. Also
of the connections between these companies and former government ministers,
and the way governments have, for more than 10 years, delayed legislation to
protect taxpayers and end cartels (8.30 ITV).
True Stories (9.30 C4) unfolds the sad tale of teenage runaway Elaine Foley
whose body was found in the Thames last year; she had been murdered. Three
months earlier police had warned her against sleeping rough and, by chance,
had been filmed doing so by another programme. That film, plus diaries,
letters and the memories of parents and friends contribute to an account of
her life and clues to her death.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Arts: The Pocket Dream - Nottingham Playhouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is a farcical fantasia on A Midsummer Night's Dream, in the manner of
that notorious Theatre of Brent, but more so. It takes no critical line;
mostly it consists of simple stage jokes, some of them evidently private
Nottingham jokes. The cast play five or more parts each, including not only
Shakespeare's characters but the players who take them in an imaginary Dream
playing at the Playhouse simultaneously. Like it or not, the audience
laughed like mad most of the evening, and were happy to help in the gags
impressed on them from the stage. It's like a springtime pantomime.
The traditional Mendelssohn ushers in a more-or-less permanent set, by
Jacqueline Gunn. On this, Theseus (Phelim McDermott, but calling himself
Simon Beaumont) woos Hippolyta (Louisa Rix, alias Phyllida Brewster) in a
mist of dry ice. Where is Philostrate? He is drinking with most of the
company at the Trip to Jerusalem pub, so the stage manager recruits a
stage-hand, a PE teacher, the front of house manager and herself to fill in.
Luckily the dozen fairies (aged from 7 to 13) are all there. They can fill
the time elegantly, and amusingly, enough with Sue Rollo's choreography.
The story is presented in a sequence of familiar scenes, though not all of
it by any means. Quince's players barely register more than their existence
at first, fair enough when they have to find 24 other parts between them.
They get their head at the end, after the house has been urged to shout 'We
want to see your Bottom]' at Neil Mullarkey. The audience was very obedient
last Friday, rising and roaring in a 'Mexican roar' for the lion, barking
like dogs, reciting in chorus, wearing funny hats.
Most of the company are associated with improvising troupes, and there is
that air of self-delight so often seen with improvisers - well deserved, at
that, for there is some enjoyable foolery. There are obvious tricks, too,
getting caught in the props, falling about, funny walks, funny voices, but
an improvising company can no doubt improve them in time. Pip Broughton, the
theatre's Artistic Director, directs the show, and she can always sort out
anything required. Perhaps each evening should to be different, according to
audience reaction.
I heard one say at the interval 'I wish they'd get on with it, the good
stuff.' Certainly a lot of Shakespeare's funniest lines, in his funniest
play, are missed, and there is little romance between the love-struck four.
Inserted business like Egeus/Oberon/Snug/Felix Barker (Mac McDonald, this
is, not the former critic of the Evening News) singing 'No business like
show business' in a spangled jacket, or the number about the greyhound race,
is no compensation.
The show is devised by Elly Brewer and Sandi Toksvig. Toksvig also plays
Puck, mostly hanging from the flies, though she has some good moments on the
ground too (as Stage Manager, Hermia, Snout, Wall), and speaks the closing
lines splendidly.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Arts: All for Love - Almeida Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first and - if you want a really short review - only thing to be said
about All for Love is: see it] If you have neither read nor seen the play
before, you will wonder why you remained in such ignorance for so long. If
already acquainted with it, you may still be surprised by the passion that
can be put into it. Either way, you are in for a treat. Diana Rigg goes with
it.
All for Love is John Dryden's version of Antony and Cleopatra. It is not
invidious to make comparisons. Since Dryden was the foremost literary critic
of his age, and no mean poet and dramatist, he knew exactly what he was
doing. He invited the comparison himself. All for Love is not better than
Shakespeare's play; it is just totally different, though in one area I think
that it achieves something that Shakespeare never attempted - that is, frank
talking by a woman about her lovers.
Ms Rigg is not an especially queenly Cleopatra in the sense of wearing robes
and crowns, at least till the end. She plays the part by exuding passion and
not being embarrassed to admit it. True, she went first with Caesar, but
Caesar possessed her person, not her love. She knows the difference between
a wife and a mistress. There are two scenes that could never have appeared
in Shakespeare: one where she explains her feelings to Antony, the other
where she meets his wife (and Caesar's sister) Octavia. This is a kind of
modern psychological drama. Octavia, played by Angela Down emerges as a real
part.
Beside the women, James Laurenson's Antony is a curiously subdued figure.
That is the only query I have about the production. To be sure, he is pretty
down, having lost his empire and his mistress, and continues to be torn
between his love for Cleopatra and his duty to Octavia. But if you make
Antony such a dead-beat, it makes one wonder why people had such regard for
him in the first place.
The admiration for Antony extends to his general, Ventidius. For Dryden did
not write a play simply about the main characters. The lines that go with
Ventidius's suicide scene are among the best quiet dramatic verse that has
been written. Bernard Horsfall, having been slightly unconvincing at the
start, cannot fail to rise to them.
Equally, Dryden fills out the characters around Cleopatra: Charmion and the
Eunuch. Charmion, played by Pauline Jameson, is a rather elderly figure;
Alexas the Eunuch (Alan MacNaughtan) even older. Between them, they seem to
make up the queen's sole court and thus emphasise her loneliness when she is
apart from Antony.
It occurred to me that Jonathan Kent's production could be filmed as it is.
It is pure drama. So much for All for Love being an obscure, academics' play
that seldom needs to be performed. It should now takes its place in the
forefront of English theatre, which is where Dryden thought it belonged.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Technology: Preserving the formula - Continuing a series on
innovation in the recession, Clive Cookson looks at the chemical sector's
survival strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the UK, industries based on chemistry have a far more successful recent
record of innovation than those based on physics. While British chemical and
pharmaceutical companies keep innovative products flowing on to the world
market, their counterparts in electronics and engineering have all but
abandoned global competition and settled for roles as niche players.
Over the last decade the UK chemicals industry has nearly doubled the
proportion of turnover devoted to research and development from 3 to 6 per
cent. This year it will spend about Pounds 1.6bn on R&amp;D.
Chemical companies are for the most part unanimous in the view that R&amp;D must
be maintained during the current business downturn, though it may need to be
focused better. And in pharmaceuticals, where R&amp;D budgets are typically 15
per cent of sales, the issue of protecting innovation in the recession
simply does not arise - the world market for medicines continues to grow
strongly.
ICI, the UK chemicals giant, inevitably dominates the performance of the
whole industry. The company has been pushing up R&amp;D spending by about 15 per
cent a year over the past decade. In 1990 it increased by Pounds 40m to
Pounds 679m.
Sir Denys Henderson, ICI chairman, told shareholders at the annual general
meeting last week that R&amp;D would continue to receive priority: 'The
innovative application of chemistry and related sciences will probably be
the most important single factor in maintaining ICI's success in the
future.'
Peter Doyle, ICI research director, expects to have slightly more to spend
on R&amp;D again this year - probably between Pounds 680m and Pounds 700m. With
the group turnover likely to fall as a result of the recession the research
budget will take a greater share of ICI's resources.
The way ICI is protecting R&amp;D from cuts contrasts with its treatment of
capital investment, which is being reduced by Pounds 100m this year.
But R&amp;D, like all ICI activities, is being focused more selectively.
Projects are most vulnerable in the field of high-performance materials, to
which ICI has devoted a lot of resources over the last few years without
achieving great commercial success. 'At present we're carefully appraising
the materials business, and I'm looking for some reshaping in that area,'
Doyle says.
Slightly more than half of ICI's R&amp;D is in the bio-sciences, mainly for the
pharmaceutical and agrochemical businesses. ICI Seeds is the best example of
an innovative field in which the company is maintaining its research effort
through the recession, as a long-term investment; it is applying
biotechnology to create new crop strains with better yields, controlled
ripening and resistance to disease and pests.
Even in the petrochemical industry, the sector worst hit by the recession,
companies are maintaining their R&amp;D effort. The Shell group, for example,
increased its R&amp;D expenditure on chemicals from Pounds 168m in 1989 to
Pounds 181.5m in 1990. Bulk petrochemicals are taking a declining share of
the research effort, however, as Shell devotes more attention to higher
added-value products ranging from lubricant additives to specialised
plastics.
To speed up the innovation process, Shell Chemicals set up a Business
Development Centre near Manchester three years ago. Its role is to translate
ideas coming out of Shell's long-term R&amp;D effort into new businesses as
quickly as possible.
Three new Shell enterprises have already emerged from the centre: Surdyne
oilfield chemicals, Rampart Packaging (which prolongs the shelf-life of food
by sealing it inside an impervious plastic membrane) and Crystal Polymers
(PET resin chips for making plastic bottles). The company says the centre
enables it to get more out of its research and development effort during the
recession.
Smaller chemical companies also emphasise their determination to protect R&amp;D
spending during the recession. 'We're cutting costs where we can in the
administrative side but not in R&amp;D,' says Steve Cuthbert, chief executive of
Brent Chemicals.
The UK chemicals industry is in a stronger financial position to protect R&amp;D
today than it was in the 1980-81 recession. 'Companies then faced the
absolute imperative of cutting back on all their costs for the sake of
short-term survival, even though this involved long-term damage,' says David
Culpin, business development director of the Chemical Industries
Association. 'That is not the case today.'
Brent, with turnover of Pounds 90m a year, spends Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m on
R&amp;D. The company is too small to undertake basic research and it does not
invent new molecules. It innovates by formulating new combinations of
existing chemicals for specialised applications in metal finishing,
aerospace, electronics, packaging and the graphic arts.
'It has taken us a long time to build up our teams of formulating chemists
and the last thing we want to do now is decimate them,' Cuthbert says.
Formulating chemistry, as opposed to synthetic chemistry (making new
molecules), is not taught in most university courses, and good, creative
formulating chemists are almost unobtainable.
Indeed good chemists of all sorts are now scarce in the UK, because
chemistry was an unglamorous and unpopular subject among students during the
1980s and universities and polytechnics were unable to expand their output
of graduates to match the rapid growth of chemical and pharmaceutical
research. All chemical companies, large and small, are therefore determined
to hold on to their researchers during the recession.
'It's getting harder and harder to find people of quality, particularly in
organic chemistry,' says Peter Doyle. ICI's policy is not only to keep
existing staff but to continue recruiting on a significant scale - unlike in
the 1980-81 recession.
UK chemical companies with international operations are expanding their R&amp;D
efforts more quickly overseas than at home. The shortage of good scientists
and engineers in the UK is only a minor reason for this. The main motive is
to carry out development work as close as possible to the main customers.
For example ICI set up its Japan Technical Centre in Tsukuba Science City
because it wanted to hitch its fortunes firmly to the global expansion of
Japanese end-user industries, especially automobiles and electronics. Only
by doing R&amp;D in Japan can ICI effectively develop special chemicals and
materials in collaboration with Toyota and Honda, Matsushita and Sony.
Laporte too is building up its overseas R&amp;D activities. 'Our R&amp;D in timber
treatment is now done almost entirely in the US, because that is where the
experts are and where we get feedback from the most important customers,'
says Hans Seidl, Laporte director responsible for R&amp;D.
At the same time international chemical companies are trying to counteract
the effects of recession by making sure that innovative products are
introduced as quickly as possible in the world's main markets. That is an
important reason for Laporte's Dollars 4m acquisition of Taiwan Spechem,
announced this week.
Spechem supplies chemicals for printed wiring boards to the fast-growing
Taiwanese electronics industry. The acquisition will enable Laporte to
manufacture its electronics chemicals in Taiwan and open up a market that
had been largely inaccessible to it as an importer.
The series will continue next week by examining the engineering sector.

<TEXT>
As plans for an underground radioactive waste repository are drawn up in
Britain, engineers in Sweden are preparing to build on the early success of
a similar project.
Caverns have been created under the Baltic Sea at a capital cost of Pounds
70m to provide a final resting place for much of the radioactive waste from
the country's 12 nuclear power reactors.
The material going into the caverns off Forsmark, on Sweden's east coast,
about 80 miles north of Stockholm, consists of waste which will be
dangerously radioactive for the relatively short term, several hundreds of
years.
Most of it is low-level waste, such as contaminated overalls and gloves but
some is intermediate-level waste, including sludges and resins.
SKB, the Swedish radioactive waste disposal company, is planning to build a
much deeper repository for long-lived intermediate-level and high-level
wastes which may remain dangerously radioactive for millions of years.
A short list of sites is expected to be announced next year and the facility
could be ready for use by the year 2020.
IS Nirex, SKB's equivalent in Britain, is currently boring into the rock
structures at Sellafield, in Cumbria, and Dounreay, in Scotland, to check
the geology before the announcement of a preferred site for its own deep
repository. However, it will cater only for low and intermediate-level
wastes.
Under present proposals, all high-level waste will continue to be stored on
the surface at Sellafield, where spent nuclear fuel is re-processed by
British Nuclear Fuels.
Nearby, in the village of Drigg, is British Nuclear Fuels' low-level waste
repository, expected to be full by the middle of next century.
Sellafield is likely to be the preferred choice for Britain's deep
repository, although no formal announcement is due before October.
The Nirex idea is to sink a vertical shaft about 700 metres deep and create
a series of caverns running from its base and capable of holding 1.4m cubic
metres of waste.
It will cost an estimated Pounds 800m to build and a further Pounds 1.6bn to
operate over 50 years.
In 1994 the UK Government is due to carry out a review of nuclear power
economics following its decision two years ago not to finance further
stations after Sizewell B, in Suffolk.
Whether or not nuclear power is allowed to expand, a large amount of
radioactive waste has already been created. Much more will arise before the
existing stations reach the end of their lifetimes and are dismantled.
A public inquiry into the Nirex plan for a deep repository is expected to
start in 1993 and last for a year.
In the meantime, the company will continue its efforts to try to convince
the public that underground waste disposal is practical and safe.
Councillors from both Dounreay and Cumbria have been taken to Sweden to
inspect the Forsmark repository, which is close to three nuclear power
reactors.
The repository is approached by two tunnels, each one kilometre long, which
slope down through bedrock about 50 metres beneath the sea.
The waste from the rest of Sweden's nuclear plants, all located on the
coast, is brought to Forsmark by ship. All waste arriving at the facility is
already packaged in concrete or steel. It is placed in concrete vaults which
are surrounded by bentonite clay.
In its first three years of operation, the repository has accumulated about
6,000 cubic metres of waste, one-tenth of its present capacity.
When it was opened it was thought that additional cavern space would have to
be created in order to cater for future operating waste.
However, engineers now believe the existing space will suffice, largely
because of new compaction techniques being used at the power stations before
despatch of the waste to Forsmark.
New caverns and an additional silo will be necessary to cope with the low
and intermediate-level waste from the dismantling of the reactors at the end
of their operating lifetimes.
SKB, which is owned by the four Swedish nuclear power utilities, estimates
it will cost Pounds 5bn to de-commission the country's nuclear power
stations and dispose of the radioactive waste involved. Operational and
de-commissioning waste is expected to total about 230,000 cubic metres.
The Swedish parliament decided after a national referendum in 1980 to
phase-out nuclear power by the year 2010. Three years ago it said plants
would begin shutting down in 1995.
However, the start of the phase-out has now been postponed because of the
difficulty in finding acceptable replacement sources of electricity.
Coal and oil have been ruled out because of the problems of global warming
and acid rain, while further hydro schemes have also run into environmental
opposition.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Bill set to become law soon - War
crimes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE War Crimes Bill, rejected by peers on Tuesday night, will become law
without further debate in the next few weeks, under the rarely-used
procedures allowing the Commons to overrule the Lords.
A police unit of detectives and support staff has already been assembled to
investigate the handful of cases in which further investigations were
recommended by the inquiry report which led to the bill.
Some Tory MPs, however, yesterday pressed Mr John MacGregor, the leader of
the Commons, to provide time for a further debate, giving MPs an opportunity
to stop the bill taking effect.
Mr Bernard Weatherill, the Speaker, told MPs that following the Lords vote
by 131 to 109 to throw out the bill for a second time, the Commons would ask
for the bill back, so that it could be certified to receive royal assent.
The legislation would allow British citizens alleged to be war criminals, to
be prosecuted for atrocities in German-occupied territories during the
Second World War.
Both the Speaker and Mr MacGregor emphasised that the Parliament Acts
procedures, used for the first time by a Tory administration, came into play
automatically after the bill's defeat.
Mr MacGregor said that the process could stop only if the Commons so
decided, but added he did not intend to provide more time for a debate,
since MPs had made their views known on several occasions, passing the bill
twice with substantial majority.
Mr Ivor Stanbrook, and Mr Robert Adley, Tory MPs and opponents of the bill,
asked Mr MacGregor how the Commons could direct otherwise unless it had time
to debate the question.
Mr MacGregor was supported by Mr John Cunningham, the shadow leader of the
Commons, who called for the procedures to be followed 'without delay', so
that the elected chamber's supremacy would be made clear.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Testing time for pragmatic Rimmer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CRUNCH comes today for Harry Rimmer, the moderate Labour leader of
Liverpool city council, where six Labour hard left rebels are standing
against official party candidates in the local government elections.
At present he heads a group of 33 moderates in the 67-strong Labour group.
Apart from five neutrals, the rest - who include the six unofficial
candidates - are part of a broad left caucus. All have been either expelled
from the party or suspended.
Mr Rimmer, formerly deputy leader to Mr Keva Coombes, has forced schism on
them by imposing rent rises on council tenants and demanding more than 1,000
redundancies to reduce council overstaffing and combat inefficiency.
After 47 Liverpool Labour councillors failed in their legal appeals against
disqualification from office for financial mismanagement, Mr Rimmer's were
the safe pair of hands in which Labour's moderates put their trust when the
47 eventually went. However, he lasted only five months.
He believed that the government had assessed Liverpool's spending needs too
low and wanted to appeal. The left stopped the process, arguing it gave
Whitehall too much say in Liverpool's budget.
Mr Rimmer resigned. Mr Coombes became leader, but his attempts to balance
left and right proved impossible. After last year's local elections, with
enough newly-elected moderates to back him, Mr Rimmer counter-attacked.
With half the left suspended from the Labour group for voting not to set a
poll tax, Mr Rimmer's camp had a majority, and he forced Mr Coombes out.
Since then he has met the left head on.
Yesterday he joined the board of the Merseyside Development Corporation, a
successful government agency hated by his opponents. Given it was May Day,
he could hardly have staged a better demonstration of pragmatism.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Criticism of Sunday trade rules is rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Lilley, trade and industry secretary, yesterday rejected
suggestions that restrictions on Sunday trading in England and Wales had
been made unenforceable by a Court of Appeal decision on Tuesday.
Mr Teddy Taylor, Conservative MP for Southend East and an opponent of the
subordination of UK law to edicts from the European Community, complained in
the Commons that the Appeal Court's ruling had created fresh uncertainty.
The court lifted injunctions banning B&amp;Q, the do-it-yourself chain, and
Wickes Building Supplies from opening stores in West Yorkshire and Somerset
on Sundays. After the ruling, a lawyer for Kirklees Borough Council in West
Yorkshire, one of the councils involved, said the ruling made the Sunday
trading laws 'virtually unenforceable'.
Mr Taylor yesterday called on the government to advise shopkeepers whether
or not they were entitled to open on Sundays, and to inform local
authorities whether they were able to implement the law approved by
parliament.
Mr Lilley said he understood that the decision concerned only the question
of whether local authorities should give undertakings to the court to back
injunctions sought to prohibit Sunday trading.
'If that is right the decision would not appear to cast doubt on Justice
Hoffman's decision last year that the 1950 Shops Act was not incompatible
with the Treaty of Rome', he said.
He concluded that the Appeal Court's decision represented no change 'in the
underlying law' in England and Wales.

FT  02 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Few jobs in equality training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EQUAL opportunities training may do more for an organisation's image than it
does for increasing job prospects for women, black people or the disabled,
according to a survey of organisations employing more than 2m people.
Almost all of the 131 private and public-sector organisations questioned by
Industrial Relations Services, a research group, thought that
equal-opportunities training for staff had improved recruitment and
selection procedures.
However, when it came to training's effect on the job opportunities of
various groups, only 28 per cent reported an improvement in the
representation of disabled people; 38 per cent in that of ethnic minorities
and 49 per cent in the case of women.
The second highest-rated effect was in obtaining support from key staff for
equal opportunities.
Nearly 90 per cent said the training had made some improvement. 'A better
image for the company' was the third highest-rated benefit.
The course most commonly offered by organisations was designed for those
involved in recruiting staff. The study said that typically, such courses
covered the legislation on equal opportunities, drawing up objective
selection criteria and interviewing.
Overall, the proportion of organisations offering equal opportunities
training was higher in the public than the private sector - a figure of 85
per cent against 71 per cent.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Concern at state cost of personal pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BURDEN on the Exchequer of people contracting out of the State Earnings
Related Pensions Scheme (Serps) is the equivalent of 1.5 pence on the basic
rate of income tax, according to a Commons Public Accounts Committee report
published yesterday.
The cross-party committee expressed concern that the Department of Social
Security had focused on its own staffing needs in assessing the impact of
personal pensions, rather than the 'potentially much more significant
implications for the National Insurance Fund'. It recommended frequent
appraisal of the cost of personal pensions to inform future policy-making.
The PAC report follows last year's findings by the comptroller and
auditor-general that the net cost of encouraging contracting out would
eventually reach Pounds 5.9bn at April 1988 prices.
Reducing the numbers in Serps would produce a saving for the National
Insurance Fund, but this would be greatly exceeded by the cost of the
National Insurance contributions rebate (5.8 per cent of relevant earnings),
the special incentive of 2 per cent of relevant earnings payable until April
1993 and tax relief on the employee's part of the rebate.
As a result of these costs, the National Insurance Fund was in danger of
falling below prudential balance, so the government switched three social
security benefits from the fund to general taxation. The cost of this
transfer for 1990-91 was Pounds 1.8bn, equivalent to a 1.5p rise in the
basic rate of tax.
In estimating the impact of contracting out, the DSS assumed that 500,000
people would take out personal pensions, perhaps rising to 1.75m in due
course.
By April 1990, 4m people had taken out personal pensions and the number was
thought to be still rising. The Government Actuary had prepared estimates of
the long-term savings to the National Insurance Fund based on 500,000, 2m
and 5m contracting out.
But the DSS had used such estimates only to forecast staffing needs,
choosing the lowest figure following the Actuary's advice that there was no
basis for a firm estimate. DSS officials told the committee that levels of
rebate and incentive had been decisions taken by ministers to cut costs of
pensions over the next 40 years.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Elf expects takeover clearance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry is expected soon to give Elf Aquitaine,
the French state-controlled oil group, clearance to take over the UK
petrol-station and refinery business of Amoco, the US oil group.
Elf's lawyers are understood to be confident that the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, which has been asked to investigate the deal, has no serious
objections to the French company's politically sensitive Pounds 300m
purchase.
British officials in Paris would not comment on the MMC inquiry, which has
provoked intense irritation in French government circles.
Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, referred the deal to the MMC
in December, even though the Office of Fair Trading advised him there was no
need to do so.
It is one of four acquisitions by French state-owned companies referred by
the DTI to the MMC since the department hardened its stance on acquisitions
by foreign state-controlled companies last July, because of fears that they
might represent covert nationalisations.
The MMC has cleared the other three French deals - two acquisitions by the
bank, Credit Lyonnais, and the proposed merger of the missiles businesses of
Thomson-CSF, the defence electronics company, and British Aerospace.
The MMC sent its report on Elf to the DTI at the end of March. Publication
of the decision is expected soon.
Mr Loik Le Floch Prigent, Elf's chairman, has strongly denied the suggestion
that the French state, rather than his management, makes the main decisions
at the oil group.
Elf is 55.6 per cent owned by the state, but the French government generally
restricts its involvement in the company to choosing the chairman.
'I can assure you that I am the patron. Nobody is looking over my shoulder,'
he said before defending the bid at an MMC hearing.
As a mark of Elf's confidence that the MMC will not overturn the deal, it
last month announced plans to spend Pounds 36m on increasing the
unleaded-petrol capacity of Amoco's refinery at Milford Haven. The
investment is to be made in partnership with Murphy Oil Corporation of the
US.
The Amoco acquisition also includes 250 petrol stations, which would lift
Elf's share of UK petrol distribution to about 4 per cent.

THE LOCAL Enterprise Development Unit (LEDU), Northern Ireland's small
business agency, helped create almost 7,000 jobs last year according to
figures published yesterday, writes Our Belfast Correspondent.
Mr Chris Buckland, the unit's chief executive, said the figure of 6,986 -
against a target of 6,000 for the year ending March 31 - was the best since
the agency was set up 20 years ago. A record Pounds 34.7m was invested in
LEDU-backed projects.
Commenting on the government's decision to concentrate on helping companies
improve competitiveness, Mr Buckland said this had brought about a change in
the emphasis for awarding grants to small companies.
LEDU deals with companies in the province employing 50 or fewer people,
identifying areas where it can help with growth.
Unionist and Nationalist political leaders in Northern Ireland yesterday
called for a meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister, to demand the
shelving of plans to privatise the province's electricity industry.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Environment warning to tourism industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CHURCHILL, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOURISM industry was warned yesterday that it must tackle the problem of
'tourist blight' on the environment if it was to survive and prosper.
Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said: 'The glittering prospects
that the tourism industry has will be tarnished unless it takes its
responsibilities to the environment seriously.'
He was speaking in London yesterday after the publication of a working
party's report on tourism and the environment. The party, drawn from all
sides of the industry, urged greater contribution to schemes to help protect
the environment from excessive numbers of tourists and developments.
Mr Howard said that the English Tourist Board was conducting pilot studies
to find the best way of coping with large numbers of tourists.
The studies will focus initially on Windsor, the Cumbrian uplands, and the
emerging tourism area of Castlefield near Manchester.
Mr Howard said tourism contributed Pounds 24bn to the economy and that
nearly 1.5m people worked in the sector. However, the influx of tourists to
Britain - nearly 18m last year - was harming the environment.
The report identified problems such as overcrowding in towns including York
and Brighton.
It added that wash from pleasure boats on the Norfolk Broads was seen to be
eroding river banks.
Consumers are suspicious that manufacturers are making environmental claims
to push up prices, says a survey published yesterday by the Mintel research
group.
The survey, of more than 1,300 adults, found that almost six out of every 10
supported 'green' products but were not prepared to pay more than a 5 per
cent premium for such goods.
Mintel's survey suggests that customers of the Sainsbury, Tesco and Gateway
supermarket chains were most interested in 'green' products.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Rising indices boost hopes for US recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration's hopes for an economic recovery later this year
were boosted yesterday by a rise in two key indices that track the health of
the economy.
The composite index of leading indicators - the main guide to future turning
points in economic activity - rose 0.5 per cent in March to register its
second consecutive monthly increase. The rise in February was revised up
from 1.1 per cent to 1.2 per cent.
The purchasing managers' index - a widely followed gauge of current
industrial conditions - rose to 42.1 per cent in April from 40 per cent in
March. This was the third monthly increase from a trough of 37.7 per cent
reached in January.
On average, the index of leading indicators has started rising three months
before the start of an economic recovery. But the lag has fluctuated widely
in previous recessions. The index started rising one month before the end of
the 1973/75 recession but turned up eight months before the end of the
1981/82 recession.
The rise in the composite leading index in March should be viewed with
caution because it largely reflected increases in consumer and investor
confidence rather than changes in the real economy. The overall increase was
more than accounted for by a surge in consumer expectations following the
end of the Gulf war. The other positive components were rises in share
prices, real money supply and building permits.
But seven of the 11 components pointed to continuing recession, including
declining orders for consumer and capital goods, rising unemployment
insurance claims and a shorter working week.
The purchasing managers' index, although up, was still well below the 44 per
cent level generally taken to indicate economy-wide recession. It has been
below 50 per cent, the level that marks recession in the manufacturing
economy, for 11 months.
Mr Robert Bretz, a spokesman for the National Association of Purchasing
Managers, said the level of the index suggested that the US economy was
still declining in April. But the rate of decline lessened for the third
consecutive month. The outlook was for a gradual trend towards recovery.
The improving tone was particularly evident in the association's new orders
index, which rose sharply to 45.9 per cent compared with 41.5 per cent in
March. Export orders are more buoyant than domestic orders.
Meanwhile, inflation pressures continue to abate. The prices index fell for
the fourth consecutive month to the lowest level since April 1982.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS to encourage the extension of pension coverage to employees of
smaller businesses have been put forward by the Bush administration. The aim
is to assist the 42m US workers, out of a total labour force of 93m, who are
not covered by private pension or savings plans.
The package from new labour secretary Mrs Lynn Martin would also encourage
workers who change jobs to transfer benefits rather than cash them in for
lump sums.
The proposals received a cautiously positive welcome from business and
pension groups, but some suggested that, even if fully enacted, they would
have a limited impact since they would do little to encourage employers to
make more generous pension contributions to ordinary employees. Critics
argue that the main effect would be to give a tax benefit to higher paid
workers who would anyway probably be saving.
In detail, the package would try to encourage small companies with fewer
than 100 workers - representing about 26m workers without private pensions
in the US economy - by exempting them from federal regulations barring
discrimination in favour of better paid employees and by eliminating most
official forms.
To obtain favourable tax treatment, owners of small companies would have to
contribute 2 per cent of an employee's pay, up to Dollars 2,000 (Pounds
1,180) a year. Similar retirement plans would be made available to 12m
employees of tax-exempt institutions and state and local governments, a
quarter of whom have no pension coverage at all.

FT  02 MAY 91 / High ideals and small deeds of Cold War victors order: Peter
Norman surveys the beginnings - and the potential pitfalls - of a new world
economic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the end of the Cold War and the Gulf war, the world's leading
industrial powers are groping towards a new co-operative, international
economic order.
But they still have to muster the political will and financial wherewithal
to make their ideals more than aspirations.
That at any rate is the impression left by the meetings in Washington this
week of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries and the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
US pressure on Germany to cut its interest rates dominated the headlines for
much of the meetings. This was a pity. The row overshadowed the ferment of
ideas now unleashed - not least in the US Treasury - on how to ensure that
all parts of the world can benefit from the Cold War victors: market
economy, pluralism and democracy.
On the other hand, the interest rate spat exposed the painful gap among
western policy makers in general - and in the US in particular - between
sometimes impressive analysis of the problems of the Soviet Union, eastern
Europe, Africa and Latin America - and feeble and frequently self-serving
policy prescriptions.
Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury Secretary, and Mr David Mulford, his
undersecretary for international financial affairs, did the world a service
in drawing attention to the shortage of global savings at a time when
demands for capital are likely to rise.
Economic restructuring in eastern Europe, reconstruction in the Gulf region
and the gradual economic rehabilitation of Latin America's debtors threaten
to add to problems caused by a sharp decline in Arab oil surpluses and
Germany's move into current account deficit.
But just as the US analysis had some merit, its prescription was at best
nave and at worst mischievous.
US Treasury officials were never able to explain how lower interest rates in
Germany and elsewhere could encourage savings. Experience tells that forced
cuts in official interest rates often result in higher long-term rates as
bond market investors fear new inflationary pressures.
The US stand on interest rates can be excused by the approach of the 1992
presidential election. But in other respects, a big gap was apparent between
Washington's hopes for a new post-Cold War economic order and its ability to
support this goal with deeds.
The rhetoric was captured in Mr Brady's remarks to the IMF Interim
Committee. 'The success of Desert Storm has shown what can happen when the
international community focuses its energies of a singular objective,' he
said. 'Now is the time to extend this spirit of international co-operation
to meet the major challenges we face on the economic front.'
The reality of what is now dubbed 'responsibility sharing' was somewhat
different. When the US was asked recently to contribute to a Dollars 1bn
loan for Czechoslovakia from the group of 24 industrialised countries, it
offered just Dollars 15m.
The US has also made sure that its allies finance help for Poland. It
dragooned the Paris Club of western creditor governments into forgiving 50
per cent of Poland's official debt while being one of Poland's smaller
official creditors.
It is now attempting to arrange a similar deal for Egypt and ring-fence the
principle of large scale debt forgiveness to exclude other hard-pressed
middle-income countries from similar agreements.
The official explanation for such inconsistency is that Poland and Egypt are
special cases because of their high levels of government-held debt. But the
differentiated policy approach can also be explained in terms of domestic US
politics and foreign policy priorities.
Because of the Polish diaspora, there are many millions of US voters with
Polish surnames or ancestors and relatively few US citizens of Czech origin.
In Egypt's case, 'Realpolitik' dictates generous treatment of one of
Washington's more dependable friends in a very volatile region.
The inconsistencies of US policy are also a sign that Washington no longer
has the financial muscle to be an economic superpower. The military
successes of the US-led coalition in the Gulf conflict have not given the US
the capacity to bend its trading partners to its will.
For this reason, Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, was determined
when in the US to gain US recognition for Germany's large DM25bn (Pounds
8.4bn) contribution to economic reform in eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union. Germany fears that without some careful coaching, the US will focus
responsibility sharing on the problems of the Middle East at the risk of
neglecting the Soviet Union which Bonn considers has huge crisis potential.
By focusing on disagreements, one could easily ignore that there is a
remarkable consensus over the principles by which the world economy should
be be managed. Pluralism, democracy and the market economy are now economic
mantras in the developing world as well as in the industrialised countries
and the former communist states of eastern Europe.
The experience of the Gulf war has persuaded the US and other industrialised
countries that democratic regimes deserve to be given financial help and
that financial leverage should be used to curb further arms races in the
developing world.
Symbolic of a huge shift in attitudes was an aside by Mr Norman Lamont in
his speech to the Developmemt Committee on Tuesday. Britain's conservative
chancellor cited with approval the speech by the finance minister of Guinea
 -a state that until the mid-1980s was trying to create its own breed of
socialism in Africa.

FT  02 MAY 91 / IMF/World Bank Washington 1991: Developing countries warned
on arms spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPING countries have been given a clear warning that excessive spending
on arms could count against their obtaining financial support from the
industrialised world, Peter Norman writes.
For the first time, the contentious issue of high military spending in the
third world was included in the final communique of the Development
Committee, which brings together industrial and developing countries to
advise the International Monetary Fund and World Bank on development issues.
The communique said the committee 'emphasised the need to re-examine the
possible reallocation of public expenditures, including excessive military
expenditures, to increase their impact on poverty reduction.'
In practice, this convoluted form of words means that bodies such as the IMF
and World Bank will examine closely the level of military spending when
discussing economic support programmes with third world nations.
Mr Barber Conable, World Bank president, admitted that security matters
raised issues of national sovereignty and that military spending was not a
fiscal issue in the strict sense. But he added that excessive military
spending did have fiscal consequences and this justified the bank raising
the question.
He was especially concerned by cases where military spending in developing
nations exceeded outlays on health and education. 'Quite frankly, that
raises interesting questions about their long-term development potential if
they are neglecting the human resources element in the interest of such
excessive military spending,' he said.
Mr Conable will soon step down as World Bank president. But his forthright
remarks echoed a rising tide of concern following the Gulf war about the
arms build-up in third world countries. During Tuesday's committee meeting,
Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, said all arms exporters must now adopt
a responsible approach to the supply of arms overseas.
In a paper prepared for a World Bank conference on development economics
last week, Mr Robert McNamara, the former World Bank president, highlighted
instances where developing countries had spent far more on the military than
on health and education.

FT  02 MAY 91 / IMF/World Bank Washington 1991: Washington blocks increase
in capital for IFC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has blocked agreement over an increase in the Dollars 1.3bn capital
of the International Finance Corporation, the private-sector arm of the
World Bank, Stephen Fidler and Peter Norman write.
The setback came in the Development Committee of finance ministers from
industrialised and third world countries, which gives guidance on
development issues to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The US
was alone on the 24-strong panel in refusing to agree the increase, but it
has a blocking vote.
The US blocked the capital rise because it wants more done to increase the
involvement of the World Bank itself in the private sector. It has suggested
that 50 per cent of the lending of the World Bank group, including the IFC,
should be directed towards the private sector by 1995.
If enough is done by the World Bank to this end, the US has suggested an
increase of Dollars 750m should be discussed. The US is clearly looking for
a greater response to its requests for more private-sector involvement than
the measures so far outlined by the bank.
Mr Barber Conable, World Bank president, expressed disappointment over the
delay. 'We'd like to move ahead as fast as possible,' he said.
The committee achieved more progress on other issues. In dealing with the
problems of the poorest and most heavily indebted developing nations, it set
a deadline of mid-1991 for the Paris Club of creditor nations to review
existing options for debt relief and produce proposals for additional debt
relief measures.
Britain has been pressing for acceptance of proposals known as the Trinidad
terms, which would result in a two-thirds write-off of the stock of official
debt owed by such countries and more generous repayment conditions, in the
hope of achieving agreement on this issue at the London economic summit in
July.
Mr Alejandro Foxley, the committee chairman and finance minister of Chile,
said after the meeting that developing country members felt concern because
of the slower economic growth in the industrial countries and the stalled
Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Beige Book shows activity still weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC activity remains weak in much of the US but there are some
indications that the decline may be bottoming out, according to the Federal
Reserve's latest assessment of regional economic trends - known as the Beige
Book.
Retail sales were still sluggish in most areas, with no sign of a sustained
improvement following the end of the Gulf war. Retail inventories were lean
but higher consumer confidence had yet to be translated into 'solid sales'.
Several districts, including Kansas City, Cleveland and Atlanta, noted
higher car sales but most reported little improvement. Dallas reported
sharply lower car sales.
Manufacturing output showed signs of bottoming out in much of the nation.
Boston, New York and Chicago were among areas reporting stable or slightly
improving conditions. St Louis and Dallas said conditions were still getting
worse. Several districts reported strong exports.
There were signs of life in residential real estate markets across the
nation, with most districts reporting increased sales of new and existing
homes. Non-residential construction remained weak.
Wage increases generally appeared modest with input prices in manufacturing
flat or falling. Loan demand was flat or slightly up in eight of the 12
districts. But credit restrictions were hampering corporate investment plans
in New England.
The report was prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco based
on data up to April 22.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Japan's Socialists cave in on themselves: Robert Thomson
charts the free fall of a party whose rise seems like yesterday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITTLE MORE than a year ago, Miss Takako Doi and the Japan Socialist Party
were basking in the glow of electoral success and thinking about the
prospect of government. This week, JSP officials have retreated to a
mountain resort to contemplate the collapse of the party's popularity.
The fall has been as dramatic as the rise. Miss Doi, the once brilliant Iron
Butterfly, is under pressure to resign as party leader from newer MPs who
owe their election to her now-faded charisma. Meanwhile, the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) is again indulging itself in factional farce without
fear of condemnation from a fragile opposition.
Miss Doi's party was humiliated at a recent Tokyo gubernatorial election,
where the JSP candidate lost his deposit, and has been crushed in other
local government contests. An opinion poll released this week showed the
JSP's support to be lower than the meagre level of three years ago.
The party's failing is clear. Having been catapulted into popularity by the
scandal-ridden LDP's ineptitude, the JSP, heavy on ideology and light on
policy, had the challenge of turning itself into the party of choice for
Middle Japan. Instead, the party's factions multiplied and only a thin layer
of policy was brushed over an immovable ideology.
One change highlights the contradictions of a party still grappling with
'class struggle' - it now likes to be known in English as the Social
Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), though the name in Japanese remains the
same. The name change was a small victory for more cosmopolitan MPs, though
Mr Shigeru Ito, chairman of the party's policy board, thinks it 'bizarre'.
'I think it's pretty stupid. There is a Socialist Party in France that has
no problem with the name. It is far more important for us to change our
policies. We have to recognise that we are at a turning point. The great
expectations of our party have become a great despair.'
Mr Ito is seen by some MPs as the individual most capable of orchestrating
reform. He puts himself among the 70 per cent of the party that is 'to the
right of the left wing', but laments that the other 30 per cent are
particularly influential and that Miss Doi herself has shown an unfortunate
resistance to change.
'After our big election victory in 1989 she was standing on the diving board
getting ready to jump. She is still standing on the diving board. The time
has come for us to give her a push.'
The plunge contemplated by Miss Doi was the reform of outdated policies on
the Japanese military, a security treaty with the US, and South Korea.
Superficial changes have been made, but the party still enthusiastically
supports the authoritarian regime in North Korea and hints that the defence
forces would be disbanded.
Ordinary Japanese disapproved of the LDP's bungling during the Gulf crisis,
yet saw nothing in the JSP's performance to inspire confidence. It was
unable to cope with complex foreign policy issues, and firmly established
itself as the party that can say no and not much else.
'We are the No Party,' Mr Ito said. 'We are always dealing in the negative.
We have to make more positive statements. Unfortunately, it should have been
easier for us to change when we had the tail wind of success. Now it will
not be so easy.'
The LDP is confident that the socialists are no longer a potent force.
Elderly LDP factional leaders, tainted by the Recruit stocks-for-favours
scandal, are forming a new queue to take a turn as prime minister. And last
week, Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, the disgraced former prime minister, returned to
the LDP with the blessing of factional heads and to the apparent
bewilderment of Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the present prime minister.
Meanwhile, JSP officials are concentrating on their own party's problems.
Newer MPs have formed groups such as New Wave and New Power, which want an
end to the influence of Marxist intellectuals and trade union leaders. The
left wing has established its own internal lobby group called A Committee to
Make a New Socialist Party, and the staunchest guardians of the faith have
formed The Socialism Association.
Mr Ito sympathises with the aims of impatient, young MPs but thinks they do
not pay due respect to the party's political traditions.
'We have a dogma problem, but they have no dogma at all. Half of the
freshmen are in the New Wave and half in the New Power - five people
couldn't decide and joined both groups. They have to understand that we
believed in a socialist revolution and Marxism and we are trying to overcome
that. They have nothing.'
Unless the party can settle its internal differences in coming months, Mr
Ito and others fear that it will be crushed at an upper house election next
year. Opposition parties still hold the balance of power in the upper house,
the weaker of Japan's two houses, though the JSP has failed to establish a
firm coalition against the LDP.
Miss Doi is likely to hold the JSP leadership, but the admiring audiences
have gone. When appointed in 1986, she had weak links to entrenched factions
and took a job which nobody else wanted. Her rise was a source of
inspiration for Japanese women and seen as a sign of profound structural
change within Japan.
Now, she is regarded as a representative of the old order and is mocked by
her party's younger MPs. They criticise her expanding wardrobe of expensive
dresses and, in describing her lack of political power, are fond of
referring to her as the 'Naked Empress'.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Talks to resume soon over HK airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ELLIOTT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS ARE to resume between Britain and China soon - possibly next week - in
a final attempt to break the deadlock over Hong Kong's plans to construct a
HKDollars 100bn (Pounds 7.5bn) airport, which would be opened soon after the
colony returns to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
There is no sign of any new initiative from either side, but both countries
favour a resumption.
If the talks fail it is likely Hong Kong businessmen will quickly submit a
private sector-led plan as a catalyst to save the project, possibly by
creating a consortium that could include the Hong Kong and Chinese
governments. This might enable the two governments to move away from
entrenched positions.
Several of the colony's top business names - including Mr Li Ka-shing and
the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank - are holding private talks. But no plan will
be proposed unless there is deadlock at a diplomatic level.
Mr Gordon Wu, a Hong Kong entrepreneur, held discussions in Peking 10 days
ago with senior officials about plans he has been promoting for five years.
This infuriated the Hong Kong government, which has secured pledges from Mr
Wu and other local businessmen that they will not make further moves for the
time being.
China has been demanding since early last year a say over the airport for a
mixture of political and economic reasons. It is concerned about the size of
the project and the extent to which it will drain Hong Kong's HKDollars 72bn
fiscal reserves and build up debt repayments after 1997.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, is believed to have reviewed the
current impasse at the end of last week with Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, who failed to reach agreement during talks in Peking early last
month. Mr Hurd warned then that the project might be shelved if China
demanded an unacceptably large degree of control.
The diplomatic initiative has passed from Hong Kong to London because
China's right to interfere in the territory's affairs is limited by a 1984
Sino-British joint declaration on the 1997 handover.
Britain and Hong Kong argue that China is attempting to breach the
declaration by demanding effective control over the airport development. It
is also believed to be using the airport to establish a precedent to gain
power over other key government decisions, ranging from fiscal policy to the
appointment of judges on a new court of final appeal.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Cheap and plentiful - and made in a Chinese jail:
Revelations of millions of dollars of exports to the west produced behind
bars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLINA MACDOUGALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOT A Red Star sweater in your cupboard? A New Life T-shirt and pair of
jeans? Or even, down in the workshop, a ZY 5140 vertical drill? If so,
someone (not necessarily you) is breaking the law since these and thousands
of other items are made for export in China's prisons.
The import of prison-made goods is forbidden in the US under the Tariff Act
of 1930, and in Britain by the Foreign Prison-made Goods Act of 1897. There
has always been a suspicion that among the billions of dollars' worth of
goods the Chinese export lurked many a circuit board or pair of socks
originating behind bars.
Remy Martin, the French cognac company which has a joint venture making
white wine in China, last year admitted to having used prison-grown grapes,
while in March packaging for the US company Joseph E. Seagram was spotted
awaiting assembly in a Shanghai prison.
William D. Paterson, director of Adidas South Korea, reportedly last year
saw thousands of shoes in a Canton prison headed for the US market. At the
request of Congress, the US Customs Service is investigating the possible
use of prison labour in the making of socks, plastic shoes and other
clothing exported to the US.
The US State Department believes that China's prison exports amount to at
least Dollars 100m worth, but AsiaWatch, the US-based human rights group,
thinks it may be much more. AsiaWatch has published documents which show
that some prisons have even set up processing and joint ventures along with
foreign companies (from Taiwan, Japan and Hong Kong).
These revelations come at a time when US-China relations have already
nose-dived because of suspicion of Peking's involvement with Algeria's new
nuclear reactor (too big to be experimental, too small to be a power
station, just right for producing weapons-grade fuel), recent missile sales
to Pakistan and Syria, lukewarm support for US policy in the Gulf, virtual
dumping of exports in the US, growing protectionism and constant
infringements of US copyrights.
'It's a measure of how angry (President George) Bush is with the Chinese
that he agreed to see the Dalai Lama,' said one Washington researcher. In
its turn, the President's meeting with the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader
in mid-April enraged the Chinese, who see any courtesies towards the Dalai
Lama as support for renewed Tibetan independence.
The AsiaWatch documents include ones that urge penal establishments not
already in the business to take advantage of the cheap labour so
conveniently available. Chinese prisoners receive almost nothing for labour
performed in uniformly grim conditions.
US state department officials who visited a Canton prison last year observed
that the inmates were paid only 3-3.50 yuan a month (30-40 pence).
The AsiaWatch documents also show that low-cost manufacture in prisons for
export (and concealment of the conditions under which they are produced) is
a deliberate policy. Qin Guishan, official of the New Life Cotton Cloth Mill
of Nantong County, Jiangsu province (a prison-run mill) says: 'The export
authorities have energetically helped us develop our mill into a base for
export. . . . We won praise from customers in Japan, the US and West
Germany. . . . Prisoners are not allowed to have direct contact or talks
with foreign businessmen (so) no secret has ever been leaked.'
'Our advantage lies in the full utilisation of the rich convict-labour
resources for the development of labour-intensive products,' writes He
Liang, another prison official. 'The reform-through-labour enterprises
charge fees for their services that are 10-20 per cent lower than those
charged by other enterprises.'
Many held in China's prison have not been through a court. Labour
re-education, as distinct from labour reform, is an administrative
punishment ordered by the police or other authorities. Even in the courts,
which hand down labour reform sentences, justice is hardly seen to be done
since the accused are considered guilty before trials (which are often
secret) begin.
Though the maximum labour re-education sentence is three years, this can be
and often is extended year by year. Many political prisoners, whose actions
 -putting up posters or writing critical articles - are not offences in
other countries, are sentenced to labour re-education.
Torture is not uncommon, and has been officially admitted. Often when
prisoners complete their sentences, they have to remain on site, working in
prison factories or farms.
The prison-goods legislation has only once been successfuly applied in the
US (to Soviet canned crab-meat in 1951) and never in Britain, as far as
spokesmen for the Customs and Excise Service could remember.

TURKEY and Iran have agreed on the need for nearly 2m Iraqi refugees who
have flooded across their borders to return home as soon as possible, the
Turkish Foreign Ministry said yesterday, Our Foreign Staff reports.
As Kurdish refugees trudged down the mountains on the Turkey-Iraq frontier
towards the allied 'safe haven' around the Iraqi town of Zakho, President
Turgut Ozal was hosting a visit by President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani of
Iran.
'We have no divergence of opinion on this matter,' a Turkish Foreign
Ministry official said. 'Both countries think these people constitute an
element of instability caused by the (Iraqi) administration and they must be
repatriated as soon as possible.'
Thousands of Iraqi refugees, most of them Kurds, have returned to Iraq since
Monday, although their progress in vehicles and on foot was slowed yesterday
by heavy rains. 'It's bedlam in the rain,' said a British Royal Marine.
A UN official in Ankara, however, said the UN was concerned that the
repatriation was moving too quickly and without due regard for the wishes of
the refugees and their long-term security.
In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was setting
up seven reception camps to accommodate 100,000 refugees along the Iranian
border with Iraq.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Tanker held in Yemen dispute: Insurers dismiss port
authorities' pollution claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YEMENI authorities have detained a tanker managed by an independent
California-based company for alleged pollution caused after an accident in
its waters.
The Mendana Spirit, managed by Western Marine, part of the Teekay Shipping
group, has been detained for 12 weeks in the port of Aden. Teekay's
insurers, the London-based Britannia P&amp;I Club, said the vessel's release was
dependent on the payment of several million dollars.
Demands have ranged from an initial Dollars 59m-Dollars 60m (Pounds
34.7m-Pounds 35.2m) to Dollars 7.5m.
The 39,976 gross ton tanker is the third vessel to be held during the past
nine months on the same grounds by Yemen's recently formed Public
Corporation for Maritime Affairs.
Britannia said yesterday that in each case no actual pollution damage had
been proved. 'It appears the authorities in Aden are using mere allegations
of pollution damage as justification for the detention of ships in order to
extract heavy cash payments.'
Teekay operates a fleet of 60 tankers and is one of the world's largest
independent tanker operators.
The Mendana Spirit collided with a Turkish bulk carrier on February 10 but
lost none of its fuel or cargo, which was duly unloaded. The Turkish carrier
subsequently sank and some of its fuel escaped from the wreck.
Port authorities refused permission for the vessel to leave Aden on 14
February and asked Britannia and the carrier's insurer, Steamship Mutual, to
help remove the wreck.
Britannia said international salvors had submitted bids of between Dollars
3m-Dollars 4m for the wreck removal contract and that the 'balance of the
money demanded must therefore relate to the allegation of pollution damage,
for which there is no evidence whatsoever'.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Offices raided in Japanese insider trading probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE prosecutors yesterday raided the offices of a listed company,
Macross Corporation, and the home of its senior managing director after the
Ministry of Finance decided to press charges of alleged insider trading.
The raids were seen by the financial establishment as genuine evidence of
attempts to combat insider trading, although the case involves a range of
small investors and a relatively small amount of disputed funds, about Y10m
(Pounds 42,700).
Mr Yoshio Kamijo, 55, the Macross senior managing director, is alleged to
have sold 22,000 shares in the company ahead of a damaging announcement last
September that a separate Macross official had booked a fictitious share
sale.
The Finance Ministry, offended in the past by foreign criticism that insider
trading is endemic in Japan, said investigators believed the advance sale
saved Mr Kamijo from a holding loss of about Y10m.
Mr Veji Sasaki, Macross president and head of an investor group and
mail-order house called Friends of Freesia, said Mr Kamijo had sold the
shares but maintained the timing of the sale was a coincidence.
Yesterday's raid is only the second since a revised Securities and Exchange
Law came into force in April 1989, banning company executives or employees
from trading in a company's shares in advance of important announcements.
The maximum penalty is six months imprisonment.
The other raid, in April last year, also involved a company on the financial
fringe - Nisshin Steamship, a shipping and leisure industry operator - and
followed allegations of share purchases ahead of an announcement of a
third-party allotment.
Macross, listed on the second section of the Tokyo exchange, is an
engineering equipment maker long managed by the same family but taken over
by Mr Sasaki in February. He emphasised yesterday that the alleged offence
took place under the company's previous management.
Mr Sasaki rose to prominence after launching an unsuccessful Dollars 450
(Pounds 264m) bid last year for Avon Japan, the Japanese arm of Avon
Products, the US cosmetics and toiletries company. His aggressive share
purchases and unorthodox methods have made him a favourite of Japan's
tabloid press, but excluded him from the financial establishment.
A Finance Ministry official said it was 'regrettable' that a senior official
of a listed company should be at the centre of an investigation, but said
the ministry was determined to prevent insider trading on Japanese
exchanges.

AMERITECH, a US telecommunications company, and France Telecom yesterday
emerged as front-runners in a race to supply Poland with a cellular
telephone system worth Dollars 150m (Pounds 88.2m), Christopher Bobinski
reports from Warsaw.
The two, working in partnership, came ahead of Crowley Cellular
Telecommunications, and BMTS, a venture grouping British Telecom, Bell of
the US, and Swedish and Finnish telecommunications groups on a final-round
short list.
PPTT, Poland's telecommunications company, is to run the cellular system in
partnership with the winner. The final three groups must now negotiate the
terms of the joint company with PPTT.

FT  02 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Hungary goes west with a new urgency: The
challenge is to compensate for a shrinking Soviet market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LASZLO Csaba, adviser to Hungary's finance minister, calls it the
country's moment of truth: can it gain access to the west - which means the
European Community - quickly enough to offset the shrinking of eastern
markets?
Last year Hungary succeeded in increasing exports to the west almost as fast
as those to its eastern neighbours fell. But now it has to run even faster
just to stand still.
Some decline was feared when the region abandoned the old system of
state-to-state trading at the beginning of the year. But the extent of the
disintegration of the Soviet Union's economy has taken everyone by surprise.
There is, say Budapest officials, simply no one to talk to about trade and
not the hard currency in the Soviet Union to pay for it.
Exports to the Soviet Union, which was Hungary's largest trading partner,
have plummeted to a fraction of their former level. It is a collapse with
few peacetime precedents.
There is also doubt about whether the EC will match its supportive rhetoric
with what Hungary needs most: an association agreement which gives market
access, especially for agricultural products.
Moreover, economists are unsure how much longer Hungarian companies can keep
up their export drive to the west.
Eastern Europe's move to trading on a commercial basis in dollars from the
beginning of this year was a leap inthe dark. The new picture, now that its
outlines are emerging, are ugly.
The Soviet Union took only Dollars 85m, or 4 per cent, of Hungary's
hard-currency exports in the first quarter. The level of trade falls well
below contracted exports of nearly Dollars 1.5bn for the whole of 1991.
It is an even smaller fraction of the Soviet Union's former weight. In 1980,
the Soviet Union took 31 per cent of Hungarian exports; in 1989 the figure
was still as much as 25 per cent.
The only relief is that it is by definition hitting bottom and it is no
longer so painful to write off a recovery in Soviet demand.
The advice from Mr Csaba, who is Hungary's leading independent expert on
east European trade, to those still relying on the Soviet market is blunt:
'Forget it as quickly as possible.'
But companies dependent on Soviet customers and their allied bureaucrats
cannot forget so easily.
The old way of exporting to eastern Europe was comfortable. Exporters dealt
with undemanding customers who ordered in huge quantities. Not only that,
but they were paid in domestic currency by their own central bank as soon as
goods crossed the border. The central authorities were left to settle the
bills in a unit of account called the transferable rouble.
Hungary's exporters were so enthusiastic that they left the central bank
with a shaky trade claim of Dollars 1.8bn against the Soviet Union. Trade
officials, fearing for the 500,000 jobs dependent on the Soviet Union,
restrained exporters less than they might have.
The willingness to continue funding exports to an insolvent customer was
'fundamentally mistaken', Mr Csaba says. 'It was based on the premise that,
once the Soviet government says it will pay, it will be in a position to
pay.'
But, having been burnt itself, Hungary is now seeking help from the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development for a trade credit to bring
hard-currency exports to the Soviet Union to life.
Another hope, less fraught with danger, is that the Soviet authorities will
lift their ban on barter. Then deals of Ikarus buses in exchange for Tyumen
oil and management advice for marble could proliferate without the need for
rare hard currency to lubricate the exchanges.
But whatever happens, Hungarian economists are counting on a decline in
trade turnover of more than half.
The only market which could make up for the loss of Soviet orders is the EC.
Exports to the EC rose by a quarter last year, overtaking exports to eastern
Europe, which fell by a quarter. But Hungary needs to repeat that
performance.
So far the signs are good. Exports to the EC were Dollars 1bn in the first
quarter of 1991, 56 per cent up on the year-earlier period, impressive even
after discounting for seasonal factors.
The performance helped to give Hungary a Dollars 150m current account
surplus in the first quarter.
Nevertheless, most of the exports which could easily be re-orientated have
been. Further export growth will depend on Hungary's association and
asymmetric free-trade agreement with the EC, which is being negotiated and
is scheduled to come into effect in January 1992.
The EC has conceded symbolic ground to break an impasse on negotiations. But
the Community has made no concrete concessions on Hungary's agricultural
exports to it, which make up a third of deliveries. All it has said is that
products of particular national importance will be given better treatment.
Hungary hopes this includes beef.
But even an open EC will not save some Hungarian products - those so tightly
bound to the Soviet market that they will live or die with it, such as table
wines. Some were produced - by accident almost - from vines planted to
stabilise sandy earth.
The best that could be said of the products is that they are cheap and
serviceable, and in demand in the Soviet Union. Mr Csaba is less charitable
when he explains why they cannot be sold anywhere else: 'They are unfit for
human consumption.'

FT  02 MAY 91 / US envoy denies Nato is holding up EC progress on common
security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SLOW progress in the European Community's negotiations on common security is
not the fault of Nato, Mr William Taft, the US envoy to Nato, said
yesterday. He rejected a complaint by Mr Jacques Delors, the European
Commission president, that EC security discussions were being held up by the
slower pace of parallel work in Nato.
In an interview, the US ambassador said that Nato had in fact delayed its
planned alliance summit from July to the autumn 'because this would
co-ordinate better with the work of the inter-governmental conferences' on a
common EC security stance and other issues.
'This (delay) was a consistent desire by the EC countries' that belong to
Nato, Mr Taft said, adding that 'perhaps Mr Delors was not aware of this
history'.
However, at last weekend's meeting of EC foreign ministers, Mr Delors' call
for Nato to speed up its talks was echoed by Mr Jacques Poos, Luxembourg's
foreign minister.
The real debate over future European security now seems to be shifting from
the EC to Nato, to confront the arguments which are being put with
increasing force by the US and which are strongly supported by Community
states like Britain and the Netherlands.
'We have told the Europeans that in our view the development of a European
security identity ought to strengthen the alliance, not compete with it, nor
duplicate it,' said Mr Taft.
He said Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, stressed to EC foreign
ministers two weeks ago 'the essential character of Nato's integrated
military structure, the need to avoid marginalisation of any of the allies
(European countries outside the EC) and the desirability of the European
political union developing a capacity to engage beyond Europe's borders'.
Nato has agreed to boost its own rapid reaction force, but only for use
within alliance territory. The US, along with Britain and the Netherlands,
now sees a European rapid deployment force, acting probably under Western
European Union (WEU) auspices, as filling the 'out of area' role that Nato
cannot agree on for itself.
Last weekend, Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, was urging his
EC colleagues to think of setting up a permanent planning cell in the WEU,
even in peacetime. However, Mr Roland Dumas, his French counterpart,
dismissed all talk of such mechanisms in the WEU as secondary to the great
question of principle: whether Europe had the political will for common
defence.
France, in fact, has gone very silent on the WEU over which it currently
presides. It used its six-month presidency to convene a special 15-minute
meeting of the organisation in the margins of the EC summit on April 8,
ostensibly to give the WEU the task of co-ordinating aid to the Kurds but
mainly to show how it could have life inside the EC womb.
In fact, the WEU role in aid co-ordination has been virtually nil. By
contrast, France has, albeit belatedly, joined in the strategic review in
Nato.
But the shift in the debate towards Nato has not necessarily raised American
hopes. One US official said: 'We are still worried about institutions being
created which are not real but which are believed to be, and which have such
an emancipatory tone to them that we feel chased out of Europe.'

FT  02 MAY 91 / Russia agrees to take over republic's coal mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government has agreed to take over all the coal mines on its
territory in the first large-scale transfer of resources from the Union to
the republic's authorities. The move is also seen as a precursor to the
transfer of the more precious oil and gas reserves.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader, signed the agreement yesterday before
a crowd of 5,000 in Novokuznetsk, in the Kuzbas coalfield. He called it a
'sign of solidarity' between Russia and the workers, and later told the Tass
news agency that 'we take the miners under our guarantee, as it were, and
what we promise and guarantee, we shall fulfil'.
This means that the Russian budget, already in deficit, must fund a 100 per
cent pay rise agreed with the Soviet government as well as overdue
investment programmes.
The agreement does not yet end the strike, however, as miners' leaders are
waiting for the Soviet authorities to sign it. Mr Yeltsin told them he
believed the Soviet side would sign this week.
The accord, and the crumbling of the strike in the main Kuzbas and Ukrainian
Donbas fields, should mean that most pits will be back in production by next
week. If the agreements are honoured, it will mean that they will all be
under republican control soon. The Donbas pits are already passing to the
control of the Ukrainian government, and the Karaganda field is being taken
over by Kazakhstan.
Mr Yeltsin's agreement appears to limit republican control to the tax
mechanism which encourages workers to lease the pits and allows them to sell
for hard currency coal above the planned target. Some pits in the Kuzbas
have already adopted this system.
Mr Yeltsin's trip to the Kuzbas, which ended last night, was also the
occasion of some early, and robust, electioneering for his campaign for the
Russian presidency. When voices from the crowd at a May Day rally in
Novokuznetsk called for the resignation of Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, he replied:
'Together we can do that'.
Mr Yeltsin and eight other republican leaders last week signed a statement
with Mr Gorbachev pledging co-operation, and on Tuesday he exchanged
telegrams with the president hoping for a new period of common endeavour.
Mr Nikolai Ryzhkov, prime minister for much of the period since 1985,
emerged yesterday as the first nationally known challenger to Mr Yeltsin in
his race for the Russian presidency. He told the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda
that various representatives of enterprises and public organisations had
pressed him to stand and that 'if I'm nominated, I'm ready to enter the
election campaign'. Mr Ryzhkov resigned last November after a heart attack,
to be replaced by Mr Valentin Pavlov.
Other suggested candidates include Mr Vadim Bakatin, former interior
minister; Mr Alexei Sergeev, a leader of the hardline United Workers Front;
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Liberal party leader; Mr Vladimir Voronin,
leader of the Centrist Bloc of Parties; and Mr Leonid Ubozhko, leader of the
Conservative party.

FT  02 MAY 91 / Baltics wonder what will be price of independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOVIET UNION'S three Baltic republics are determined to restore their
pre-1940 independence even if this means facing considerable economic
hardship.
The likely high cost of secession is one of the few clear things to have
emerged from last week's joint declaration by President Mikhail Gorbachev
and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader.
On the face of it, the declaration was at least a step towards allowing the
six rebel republics their independence, but Moscow seems ready to exact a
high price. The declaration gave them the right not to sign a union treaty
binding them to Moscow; they could settle the matter 'independently', but
most favoured nation status would be granted to those which chose to sign.
This is taken to mean that non-signatories will have to pay hard currency
for energy and other supplies at world prices, thus challenging their
ability to survive outside the Soviet economic system.
The Baltics - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - are prepared to press their
claim for secession. Armenia and Moldavia might yet sign the treaty, and
nobody seems to know what Georgia, the sixth of the rebels, will decide,
although it has chosen a confrontational approach to press its claim for
independence from Moscow.
The precise meaning of the declaration is still unclear. Mr Vytautas
Landsbergis, the Lithuanian president, noted with typical dry humour: 'You
can find whatever you want in this document . . . only concrete actions will
tell us what it means.' Hours after the document was published last Tuesday,
Soviet troops seized a bank building in a suburb of Vilnius, despite Kremlin
promises to solve its disputes with Lithuania by political means.
Mr Landsbergis and his colleagues in neighbouring Latvia and Estonia say the
switch to world prices will mean considerable economic hardship, but that
this could be manageable if Baltic republics' western borders are open to
trade with the outside world.
'Otherwise, this will amount to an economic blockade,' points out Mr Yuri
Kahn, Estonia's representative in Moscow. Illustrating what the switch could
mean, Lithuania's trade minister, Mr Vitas Navitskas, says that oil would
cost Rbs3,500 (Pounds 1,147) a tonne, up from Rbs70 a tonne. The
declaration's ambiguity - crucial to achieving a blatantly political
compromise between Mr Gorbachev and the nine republican leaders who signed
it - means that what happens next will depend on how their agreement is
implemented.
This, in turn, will be determined by political developments and economic
realities.
In economic terms, the Kremlin and parties to the union treaty, due to be
finalised this summer, will have to think long and hard about switching to
pure market relations with those republics which refuse to sign the treaty.
The centrally planned Soviet economy is still so integrated that both sides
would suffer from an abrupt economic divorce - as shown by the collapse of
Soviet trade with eastern Europe, as a result of a similar switch to hard
currency trading. Plants in the 15 republics depend on each other for
supplies in a situation where one enterprise is often the sole producer of a
particular industrial input. The manufactured goods they produce are not
competitive in international markets, which means that republics would be
best served by continuing to barter with each other.
Economic sense dictates that all republics opt for some kind of economic
union, even if only nine of them are joined in a political federation.
Indeed, this may be what Mr Yeltsin and other progressive republican
leaders, such as Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Kazakhstan president, had in
mind when they signed the declaration - even though it may not yet be the
right time to say so. Finnish State Railways (VR) is refusing to handle most
Soviet rail transit traffic because of problems over payments, a senior
official told Reuter in Helsinki. The independent Soviet concern
Soyzvneshtrans, which carries some 60 per cent of transit traffic, owes VR
'tens of millions' of markka, said Mr Henri Kuitunen, cargo division
director.
The ban on handling its wagons began early yesterday. Mr Kuitunen could not
say how long it would last. Cargo of other companies, including Soviet
organisations, is being handled normally. The cargo, mostly liquids but also
dry bulk, travels mainly to the Finnish ports of Kotka and Hamina.

THE LEGAL squabbling between Walt Disney and the makers of the Muppets ended
yesterday when both sides 'amicably resolved' their differences and reached
an out-of-court settlement which will allow Disney to exhibit two Muppet
attractions at its Orlando, Florida theme park.
The altercation started nearly two weeks ago when Henson Associates, a
family-run company founded by the late Jim Henson, filed a suit accusing
Disney of violating copyrights and trademarks of the Muppets.
A Disney spokesman expressed deep regret for what was described as a serious
misunderstanding, and apologised to the Henson family and their company for
any harm that may have been caused.
Mr Brian Henson, son of the late Jim Henson and president of Henson
Associates, said that they had granted Walt Disney a licence for the Walt
Disney World resort in Florida.
The licence is for an initial term of 18 months, and contains an option for
an extension by another 3 1/2 years. Disney will have exclusive rights to
the attractions and to the Muppets appearing in them.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONTARIO'S nine month-old left-wing government has jolted the business
community with a budget which more than trebles the provincial deficit,
imposes several tax rises and greatly expands the role of the public sector
in the economy of Canada's industrial heartland.
Presenting a budget which flies in the face of the federal government's
policy of fiscal restraint, provincial treasurer Mr Floyd Laughren said: 'We
had a choice to make this year  - to fight the deficit or fight the
recession. We are proud to be fighting the recession.'
The provincial deficit will soar to CDollars 9.7bn (Dollars 8.4bn) in the
year to March 31 1992 from CDollars 3bn last year, as a result of stagnant
revenues and a 13.4 per cent jump in spending. The spending increases
include a 40 per cent jump in welfare payments, loans for businesses hurt by
the recession, extra low-income housing, and various other job-creation
projects.
The budget cuts provincial taxes on low incomes, but raises the surtax on
incomes above CDollars 84,000. It imposes an extra fuel tax of 3.4 cents a
litre, and lifts the capital tax on banks and trust companies.
The budget measures were strongly criticised by business leaders, who warned
that they would place a heavy future burden on taxpayers and fuel inflation.
Mr Donald Mazankowski, Federal finance minister, and his predecessor Mr
Michael Wilson also attacked Ontario's strategy, saying that it will 'slow
down our efforts as a country to get out of the recession.'
The Bank of Nova Scotia said that the budget measures would encourage
businesses to move away from Ontario. 'Attempts to pay for new programmes
and offset a softer revenue trend with tax increases will be
self-defeating.'
Dominion Bond Rating Service of Toronto yesterday put Ontario and Ontario
Hydro's bonds on credit watch for possible downgrading. The two leading US
rating services are also expected to review the province's credit rating.
Ontario is the only Canadian province with a Triple A rating.

THE forced resignation of a key Venezuelan official this week points to
strong differences on economic policy among government agencies.
Ms Gabriela Febres Cordero, head of the Venezuelan government's Foreign
Trade Institute (ICE) resigned on Monday after she suggested in the press
that problems in expanding Venezuela's non-traditional exports were due
mainly to the lack of a coherent industrial policy.
Ms Febres Cordero's departure means that the government of President Carlos
Andres Perez has lost one of its most effective defenders of economic
reform.
One of the main goals of the Perez administration has been to boost
non-traditional exports in an economy dominated by the state-owned petroleum
industry. Non-petroleum exports have tapered off in recent months, making it
unlikely that the government can reach its goal of Dollars 4bn in
non-traditional exports this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICIANS, soldiers and villagers in Indonesia's western-most province of
Aceh, on the island of Sumatra, say a big army operation against separatist
rebels in the area is still underway, despite claims by the Indonesian
authorities that the province's problems are over.
Earlier this year, Mr Ibrahim Hasan, the governor of Aceh, said that the
military operation against the rebels had ended and that security had been
restored in the province.
In March, the regional military commander said that the 18-month-old
rebellion had been crushed. Officials in Jakarta have spoken recently of the
area being calm.
However, according to local people, including politicians and human rights
workers, bodies are still being found dumped on the sides of eastern Aceh's
main roads every day.
It is believed that more than 2,000 people have died in the continuing
violence and that most of them are civilians killed by the Indonesian
military. It is unclear exactly who the rebels are or what they want, but
they are understood to include a handful of former soldiers, some common
criminals and a few separatists who have reawakened old independence
sentiments among the Acehnese people.
At least 14 people, including a university professor and a member of the
local parliament, are on trial accused of subversion and plotting to set up
an independent state.
Aceh is Indonesia's most strongly Islamic province and it has a history of
separatist movements. With huge natural gas reserves, coal and extensive
forests, it is also one of Indonesia's richest province's. The rebellion has
played on Acehnese resentment over the amount of the province's wealth that
goes to the central government in Jakarta, and the number of jobs in Aceh
that go to people from the central island of Java.
Last month more than 100 Acehnese arrived by boat in neighbouring Malaysia.
According to rebel sources there, they were fleeing army persecution and
seeking political asylum.
The Indonesian government said the boat people were just economic migrants
and Malaysia, which is already host to thousands of Indonesian illegal
imigrant workers said last week that it would send the refugees back home.
People in Aceh say that if that happens the deportees may join the lists of
dead.

FT  01 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Raid for Tootal stock
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S largest textile group Coats Viyella mounted what could be the final
attack on its fellow textile company Tootal yesterday. Coats raised the
terms of its offer and then tried to win control more quickly by raiding the
market for stock. Around 10 1/2 m shares were believed to have been bought
at the same level as the new bid price, with Coats willing to purchase 65m
which would take its shareholding over 50 per cent. Trading volume in Tootal
jumped to 22m shares.
The only surprise about the latest offer was the cash element. All-paper
terms had been confidently anticipated, but Coats increased the original bid
of 65p cash per share to 80p and threw in for good measure the Tootal final
dividend of 3.05p; there is an alternative offer, comprising a mixture of
shares and cash.
Mr Mark Finnie of Hoare Govett echoed the sentiments of several analysts by
saying: 'At this level I would expect the deal to go through'. Tootal closed
5 up at 84p and Coats 3 down at 138p.
Allied-Lyons rise
The inconsistencies of the wider market failed to deter another flurry of
speculative activity in drinks and food major Allied-Lyons. Stories began
circulating again of a bid from Hanson, although a more plausible reason for
the upturn was a buy recommendation from an influential broking house.
A sector researcher described Allied as 'the best sitting duck in the
market'. When the risks and rewards are weighed up, he said, there are
likely to be outbreaks of speculative enthusiasm.
The early retirement of both the chairman and chief executive of
Allied-Lyons is awaiting confirmation. Cynics point to the group being
rudderless in terms of management, and this may have given rise to the
latest round of speculation. Allied settled 18 ahead at 545p on turnover of
4m shares.
Drug patent dispute
Glaxo fell 27 to 1097p as sentiment was depressed by a law suit from rival
SmithKline Beecham alleging Glaxo's anti-nausea drug Zofran infringed its
patent. Glaxo said it would defend its position.
Analysts played down the issue. Mr Robin Gilbert at James Capel said the
lawsuit was unlikely to return to the headlines for some time as the case
progressed through the US legal system. Mr Steve Plag at County NatWest said
the two companies would probably come to some royalty agreement which would
have 'miniscule' financial consequences.
SmithKline firmed a penny to 805p, a good performance given the dollar's
retreat during the session. Traders said Glaxo had actually gained ground in
dollar terms.
BET reaps reward
BET, the business services group, began to reap the rewards yesterday of
presentations to US investment institutions. According to the market, these
have been well received and transatlantic buying interest has since
increased to quite substantial volumes. American support contributed to high
turnover yesterday of 4.7m shares, although demand from UK investors also
rose.
The latter were starting to focus on the yield, exactly 10 per cent when
trading opened yesterday. This is high for a Footsie stock. BET said in
February when the shares were under attack that it saw no reason to expect a
reduction in total dividend for the year to March 31, 1991. The group should
report preliminary figures in mid-June. BET shares ended 9 higher at 182p.
The stoic performance of British Gas shares on Monday, in response to the
company's acceptance of Ofgas's revised pricing formula, gave way yesterday.
Domestic and overseas institutions were heavy sellers of the stock after the
bearish response by the press to the Ofgas moves. Gas shares dipped to 235p
and closed a net 8 off at 236p on 15m turnover.
Exploration and production (E &amp; P) stocks bore the brunt of persistent
selling pressure generated by a bearish review of the sub-sector by Strauss
Turnbull. The broker acknowledged it had taken a pessimistic view of E &amp; P
issues, with the emphasis on the large downside potential in Lasmo, 8 off at
350p, and Enterprise, 4 easier at 560p. Strauss's only positive
recommendations in the area were Premier and Clyde, whose shares have
already sharply underperformed, Strauss said.
Ultramar fell to 309 1/2 p before closing a net 7 lower at 312p, with an
attempted placing of around 2m shares at 315p only partially successful; the
Seaq delayed ticker showed a line of 768,000 shares traded for cash at 311p.
Suggestions that institutions had been unravelling the Water Package and
selling on some of the constituents ahead of tomorrow's local elections put
the water sector under renewed downward pressure.
Specialists said the selling had come from UK and overseas funds. The
Package dropped 43 to Pounds 2940. Of the individual stocks, there was
significant selling of Welsh Water, 7 lower at 319p, Yorkshire, also 7 off
at 305p, and Thames, 6 cheaper at 305p.
The electricity issues held up well, albeit in thin trading. Manweb was
prominent, up 4 at 237p, as was Seeboard, which climbed the same amount to
195p.
Kingfisher was boosted after the Court of Appeal lifted an injunction
banning B &amp; Q, its home improvements chain, from opening on Sundays. The
injunction against Wickes' building supplies was also removed. Kingfisher
firmed 2 to 497p, while Wickes gained 2 at 60p. Boots, which with WH Smith
(up 4 at 374p), jointly own the Do It All home improvements chain, put on 3
to 369p, although they were not involved in yesterday's legal action.
Asda continued to weaken as speculation about poor trading company's
meetings with brokers last week has done little to arrest the growing belief
that the food retailer is being squeezed by J. Sainsbury and Tesco. Asda
closed a penny lower at 119p; the shares have fallen 11 per cent since the
middle of April.
Unilever was off 10 at 738p as investors continued to switch out of the plc
and into the NV shares, which are quoted in the Netherlands and New York.
The shares were also depressed by suggestions that a broker would lower its
profits forecast.
There was an increase in activity in NatWest during the afternoon, with the
shares rallying to close a shade better on the day at 325p, after 320p;
turnover totalled 8.2m shares. Midland, ahead of tomorrow's annual meeting,
lost 7 to 215p on 3.5m. First National Finance fell 12 to 193p after a
broker's downgrading.
William Baird was affected more by the prospect of greater liquidity in the
stock, said traders, than the cash call of Pounds 39m through a rights
issue. The shares, previously tightly held, dropped 20 to 238p.
A confident statement and increased dividend distribution outweighed
slightly lower annual profits from Yule Catto, and at the close the stock
was 10 higher at 143p. The company expects to maintain momentum both in
earnings and dividend growth, providing recessionary conditions do not
deteriorate further.
The warning at yesterday's annual meeting that interim profits 'will fall
significantly short' of those achieved in the same period last year lowered
Torday &amp; Carlisle 36 to 118p.
Automated Security Holdings, the London-based security systems group,
slipped 6 to 223p after announcing its intention to issue Pounds 60m worth
of convertible capital bonds, yielding 9.5 per cent and convertible in 2006
at 250p a share. ASH accompanied the news with a confident statement on
current trading, which it said showed turnover in the first four months of
the year ahead of the same period last year.
ASH said it was raising the money to take advantage of growth opportunities
in Europe and the US, adding that it had applied for a US listing for its
ordinary shares.
Greycoat fell 11 to 327p as brokers continued to trim their forecasts ahead
of the final results expected in June. Smith New Court cut its net asset
value estimate for 1990/91 to 500p from 560p, bringing it in line with other
brokers. Office rental values in central London are still weakening and show
no signs of recovering this year, according to Smith.
Evered Bardon fell to 92 1/2 p immediately following the preliminary
figures, but later steadied to close a net 4 off at 94p. Specialists said
the group would struggle to achieve current year profits above Pounds 30m
and that a rights issue to reduce its gearing of around 60 per cent could be
expected in the not-too-distant future.

FT  01 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rise on Fed move is
trimmed back sharply
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
AN UNEXPECTED interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve gave a boost to share
prices yesterday, but concern about the slow progress of US economic
recovery sharply restricted the extent of the market's gains, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up a net 10.89 at
2,887.87, having been more than 30 points ahead early in the day. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion, rising at first and falling
back at midsession before firming again to end up 1.69 on balance at 375.35.
The Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks declined from the outset,
however, and finished down 3.02 at 484.72.
New York SE volume expanded from Monday's low 150m shares to reach 205m,
while gains led declines by 844 to 751.
The initial response to the reduction in the discount rate - the interest
rate the Fed charges for loans to member banks - was positive, with the Dow
climbing sharply in the first few minutes of trading. Investors hoped that
lower rates would spur economic activity and boost stock market sentiment.
Most of the gain was clawed back later in the day as dealers and investors
pondered the Fed's motives for cutting rates. The Fed said it had eased
monetary policy because of continuing weakness in the economy. This evident
concern about the slow pace of progress, and yesterday's poor March factory
orders data, unnerved the market, which had been looking forward to a
recovery in the economy by midsummer.
The extent to which the recession has affected US industry was underlined by
yesterday's figures from two of the nation's big car manufacturers. General
Motors reported a first-quarter loss of Dollars 1.1bn, against a profit of
Dollars 710m a year earlier, and Ford unveiled a deficit of Dollars 884m,
against a profit of Dollars 506m in the first quarter of 1990.
The market had been forewarned that the carmakers were facing difficulties,
and both stocks rose in heavy trading. General Motors climbed Dollars 1 3/4
to Dollars 35 5/8 and Ford put on Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 32 1/2 .
Bank shares gained ground in early trading on expectations that profits
would climb as banks took advantage of the widening spread between lending
charges and borrowing costs. However, as the wider market fell back so did
many bank stocks, leaving BankAmerica down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 38 3/8 ,
Manufacturers Hanover Dollars  3/8 weaker at Dollars 25 3/8 and Chemical
Bank Dollars  1/4 lower at Dollars 20 1/2 .
Among those that held on to their gains were Citicorp, up Dollars  1/8 at 15
3/4 , and Bankers Trust, Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 47 1/4 .
Over-the-counter stocks fell sharply from the start as investors continued
to take profits after the market's first-quarter rally of almost 30 per
cent. Leading the way were Apple, Dollars 3 1/4 lower at Dollars 55, Amgen,
Dollars 5 weaker at Dollars 126 3/4 , Intel, down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars
49 1/4 , and Sun Microsystems, Dollars  1/4 off at Dollars 36 3/4 .
News of an explosion at one of Marine Power Central's Yankee Nuclear power
plants in the northeastern state of Maine left its shares Dollars 1 lower at
Dollars 17 1/8 .
Canada
AFTER A slightly higher opening, Toronto lost ground and then recovered to
close little changed after moderate trade.
The composite index ended 3.4 off at 3,468.8 as declines edged out advances
by 323 to 235. Volume came to 21.4m shares.
Ten of the 14 sub-indices showed modest declines. Gold issues, buoyed by a
rise of nearly USDollars 4 an ounce in the New York price for bullion,
advanced 2.16 per cent.
Domtar, unchanged at CDollars 9 1/8 , reported sharply increased
first-quarter losses from continuing operations. Westcoast Energy, off
CDollars  1/8 at CDollars 20 3/4 , announced higher first-quarter earnings.
Imasco held steady at CDollars 27 following lower first-quarter profits.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Discount rate cut hits dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR fell sharply after the US Federal Reserve cut its discount rate
to 5.5 from 6.0 per cent yesterday.
US President George Bush appeared pleased with the move. He said that 'this
will stimulate our economy' as it climbs out of recession, and added that
commercial banks are expected to follow suit with rate reductions.
By the time of the London close a small but leading US provincial bank, the
Southwest Bank of St Louis, had lowered its prime lending rate to 8 3/4 from
9 per cent.
Economic news also tended to push the dollar down, US factory orders showing
a fall of 2.8 per cent in March against a February decline of 0.6 per cent.
The Chicago Purchasing Management Association Index fell to 42.1 from 45.9
per cent, ahead of today's release of the National Association of Purchasing
Managers Index, indicating that the important industrial area of northern
Illinois and northwest Indiana remains in recession.
At the London close the dollar had dropped to DM1.7170 from DM1.7690; to
Y136.30 from Y137.60; to SFr1.4490 from SFr1.4840; and to FFr5.8025 from
FFr5.9650. Its index fell 1.3 to 65.9.
The D-Mark improved across the board after Mr Horst Koehler, German Finance
Ministry state secretary, said in Washington that he does not expect the
Bundesbank to cut rates. He said this before the US move, but sentiment in
Frankfurt suggests that Germany is still unlikely to ease policy in the
immediate future.
In London the D-Mark rose to Y79.40 from Y77.80 against the Japanese
currency, to FFr3.3795 from FFr3.3720 against the French franc and to
L739.65 from L738.25 in terms of the Italian lira.
A senior official at the Bank of Japan indicated that his country has no
plans to match the US rate cut. Earlier in the day Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto,
Japanese finance minister, said Japan has no need to change its monetary
policy.
Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the D-Mark was steady around
the middle of the system. The Spanish peseta remained the strongest member
and the French franc the weakest.
Sterling eased to fourth from third strongest position in the ERM, trading
below the peseta, Italian lira and Belgian franc. The pound improved against
the dollar and the Japanese yen, but otherwise showed mixed changes.
The US discount rate reduction led to an easing of wholesale rates in
London, and the market was nervous ahead of tomorrow's local government
elections in England and Wales. These may provide guidance on the timing of
the next UK general election.
Sterling rebounded 4.70 cents to Dollars 1.7240. It also rose to Y235.00
from Y230.75 and to SFr2.4975 from SFr2.4875, but dipped to DM2.9600 from
DM2.9675 and was unchanged at FFr10.0025. The pound's index gained 0.7 to
91.4. In New York sterling finished 75 points higher at Dollars 1.7315.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviet creditworthiness causes
concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSH Administration is nervously eyeing declining Soviet
creditworthiness before responding to a personal request from President
Mikhail Gorbachev for Dollars 1.5bn in new food credit guarantees.
Speaking at a press conference Monday, President Bush said he would like to
be 'helpful' to the Soviets as well as to US grain producers but he was
concerned about the country's ability to repay its debts.
He added: 'Regrettably, the Soviet Union has not entered into the market
reforms that I think Gorbachev aspires to.'
In a rambling discourse on the credit issue, he seemed interested in linking
the credit with Soviet economic reforms. He said he wanted to find ways 'to
make the credit more secure'.
Recent changes in US farm law make it necessary for the president to take
creditworthiness into consideration in granting loans. According to Mr Steve
McCoy, president of the North American Export Grain Association, the
administration might have to design a new programme to come to Mr
Gorbachev's aid.
In Congress the debate over credit has gone from suggestions that the
guarantees be granted directly to the Russian republic to ideas about
'securitising' the credit or linking it to economic reforms.
Prime Minister Ivan Silayer of the Russian republic, on a visit to
Washington last week, said he supported the Gorbachev credit initiative and
downplayed the issue of who would get it.
The Russian Republic would get 60 per cent of the grain purchased through
the central government he said, according to an agreement with the Soviet
authorities.
'We also informed the officials in the administration that next year we'll
be having a possibility to conclude independently deals on importing grain
from the US,' he said. 'We can be able to conclude agreements for three to
five years. We would be able to do that independently next year.'
On Capital Hill Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, has developed a
revolving credit plan under which the Dollars 1.5bn would be granted in
three tranches.
He would seek firm assurances that the food be directed to the Soviet
population, rather than the military or Communist party apparatus, and that
it not be used to pressure the independence-minded republics.
The first Dollars 500m of credit guarantees would be released immediately.
The second and third parts would be paid only after Washington received
reports of their proper use. Repayment of earlier credits could be required
before the second and third tranche are released.
Meanwhile the farm lobbies have begun to press for the credit guarantees.
The US Feed Grains Council asked the president for an immediate allocation
of Dollars 500m to meet import needs during May and June.
Mr Duane Jones, the council's chairman, wrote in a letter to President Bush:
'Without these additional credit guarantees the Soviet livestock industry
will collapse and US farmers will lose the Soviet Union as a feed grains and
protein customer for many years it would take the industry to recover.'
Mr Ron Rivinius, president of the National Association of Wheat Growers,
warned the president that without the new credit, the USSR might default on
its long-term grain agreement.
This obliges Moscow to buy an average of 147m bushels of US wheat annually
for the next five years.

FT  01 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Government Equities: Duracell
increases size of issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURACELL, the US battery company owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, is
expected to price its 25m share offering later today. The size of the issue
has been increased from 20m shares, and now 5.625m shares will be offered
internationally via Merrill Lynch. The indicated price range has been
increased from Dollars 12-14 per share to Dollars 15-16 per share.
There is no sign of a slackening in the pace of medium-sized US companies
filing share offerings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For
example, Viacom, a media and communications company, filed for an offering
of 9m shares on Friday, 1.8m of which will be placed internationally via
Morgan Stanley. The issue will raise Dollars 285m.
Supply of convertible bonds also continues in the international market. On
Friday, Chubb, the US insurance and development group, came with a Dollars
250m seven-year convertible bond issue lead managed by Morgan Stanley.
The bonds carry a coupon of 6 per cent and the right to convert into Chubb
equity at a Dollars 86 per share, a conversion premium of 24.4 per cent over
the Dollars 69.8 share price when the deal was launched. The company's share
price had slipped back to Dollars 67 yesterday and the bonds were trading at
97.5 bid, having been launched at par.
Mirror Group Newspapers, the UK newspaper publisher controlled by Mr Robert
Maxwell, yesterday broke the monopoly of US companies offering equity to
international investors.
Salomon Brothers has underwritten the international tranche and is leading a
group of international banks on the deal.
Salomon expects strong demand from international investors attracted by the
high dividend yield. As an equity market sector, US newspaper publishing
firms trade on a dividend yield of about 3 per cent.

FT  01 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Government Bonds: Treasuries
advance after Fed's surprise cut in rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOND prices firmed at both ends of the market yesterday after the Federal
Reserve unexpectedly cut the discount rate and signalled a lower Fed funds
rate.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up  5/32 at 96 1/2 ,
to yield 8.183 per cent. The two-year note was up  5/32 at 100 3/8 ,
yielding 6.779 per cent.
The Fed's decision to lower the discount rate from 6 per cent to 5 1/2 per
cent stunned the market, which had been convinced that the Fed's refusal to
cut rates a few weeks ago following bad jobless figures and good inflation
data, and its recent operations in the credit markets, indicated that the
authorities were determined not to loosen monetary policy any further.
The rate cut suggested that the Fed was more worried about the state of the
economy than the markets had previously thought, said analysts. Yesterday's
figures showing a 2.8 per cent decline in March factory orders and a weak
purchasing managers' index for April reinforced the view that the economy is
taking a long time to come out of its current slump.
The relatively subdued response to the rate cut from the long end of the
market was down to a reluctance among dealers to push prices up too high
before next week's big auctions of three-year, 10-year and 30-year bonds.
Although the discount rate move was unexpected, the Fed's pre-noon
intervention in the credit markets was anticipated. The Fed conducted
Dollars 3bn in customer repurchase agreements to add reserves to the banking
system, a move designed to push the Fed funds rate to a new target of 5 3/4
per cent. Fed funds did hit 5 3/4 per cent during the day, but by late
afternoon the rate had firmed to 5 15/16 per cent.
GERMAN government bond prices showed strong gains yesterday following the
0.5 per cent cut in US interest rates, which killed fears that the
Bundesbank might raise German interest rates at Thursday's council meeting.
Traders said that prices firmed across the yield curve and they expected to
see some buying of shorter dated bunds now that there was less chance of an
interest rate increase. They noted that there had already been some buying
of shorter-dated bunds before the US cut was announced as investors moved
out of longer-dated bunds.
The D-Mark firmed after Mr Horst Koehler, state secretary in the Finance
Ministry, said in Washington he saw no chance of Germany cutting interest
rates for the time being.
The Bundesbank yesterday accepted bids for a total of DM40.4bn in a
two-tranche tender for securities repurchase funds. It offered DM29.5bn of
34-day funds at 8.6 per cent and DM10.9bn of 62-day funds, mostly at 8.9 per
cent, which means that a net DM4.9bn will be drained from the market.
Traders said that yesterday's pay strike by more than 200,000 western German
engineering workers was a cause of concern to the market.
Critics of the engineering workers' wage demand say their 10 per cent claim
threatens to slow economic growth in western Germany and throttle the east
German recovery, and the union's demands have evoked strong criticism from
the Bundesbank as well as from employers.
JAPANESE government bond yields fell against the background of lower US
interest rates and rekindled hopes that the Bank of Japan would cut the
official discount rate soon.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 government bond dropped two basis points,
from 6.73 per cent to 6.71 per cent, in London as soon as the US discount
rate cut was announced.
The yield opened at 6.705 per cent in Tokyo and dipped to 6.69 per cent
before closing at 6.73 per cent. Traders said they expected to see a
flattening of Japan's inverse yield curve as yields at the short end came
down. The strengthening of the yen against the dollar should make it easier
for the Bank of Japan to countenance a cut in the official discount rate.
However, Japan's finance minister, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, yesterday echoed a
statement from a Bank of Japan official in Washington to the effect that
Japan would not match the US rate cut.
UK government bond prices rose yesterday with shorter maturity bonds gaining
more than long-dated gilts, in response to the US rate cut.
Trading began in a gloomy mood following the results of the Confederation of
British Industry industrial trends survey, which indicated that an upturn in
the British economy was still some way off. However, prices recovered after
the US announcement.
The benchmark 11 3/4 gilt due 2003/07 rose from 109 15/16 to 110 1/16 to
yield 10.245 per cent.
THE FRENCH Treasury said it would offer FFr6bn-FFr8bn of tap stock (OAT)
tranches at its next monthly auction tomorrow. The new 9.50 per cent OAT due
2001 will be one of the taps on offer and will become the 10-year benchmark
as its liquidity increases.

FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: US stores put a revival plan on
the counter / A report on the slow struggle back to health for Allied and
Federated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores Corporation filed for
protection from their creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code
in January 1990, the move symbolised the ending of debt-laden Eighties.
'Loan Spree seems over,' ran one newspaper headline.
The groups - taking nine chains, ranging from Manhattan's Bloomingdale's to
Lazarus in Cincinnati and Bon Marche in Seattle - had been bought up by
Canada's Campeau Corporation via two leveraged bids. The first, in
late-1986, had given the Canadian property developer control of Allied for
Dollars 3.6bn; the second, in 1988, allowed it to snap up Federated for
Dollars 6.6bn.
Yet, within a year of this latter deal, problems had started to emerge, and
by late-1989 it was clear that there was insufficient cash flow from the
stores to service the massive debts taken on to acquire them. With little
prospect of asset sales bringing in desired prices, bankruptcy ensued. Total
estimated claims - at the January 1990 filing date - were put at around
Dollars 8.2bn.
This week, Federated and Allied summed up a very different trend in US
corporate life. Late on Monday, the two companies, together with their
immediate parent, Federated Stores Inc (FSI), filed their own suggested
reorganisation plans with the Cincinnati courts - and quickly ran into
complaints from some creditors. In short, another slow and costly struggle
back to corporate health seems to be under way, as the excesses of the
previous decade are remedied.
The plans are inevitably complex, although the basic structure is clear
enough. Essentially, creditors of the two stores groups would be offered a
mixture of cash, new debt securities and equity in a new company, formed by
the merger of Allied and Federated's department store interests (there is
already common senior management). The equity would almost certainly be
listed, and no significant assets would be sold off. The aim is to pluck the
group from Chapter 11 by early-1992.
Who would get what under the reorganisation plan is dealt with at length.
General unsecured claims against Federated, for example, would receive stock
in the new merged group; general unsecured claims against Federated
subsidiaries would get cash and some medium-term notes; and so on.
At the end of the day, the plan suggests that the ongoing group might carry
around Dollars 2.8bn of debt. The value of its equity is assumed to be
around Dollars 2.3bn, although the plan stresses that this figure is derived
from a whole heap of assumptions.
As for creditors of FSI, the parent of the two stores group, they would swop
their claims for stock in the merged Allied-Federated group and in Ralphs, a
Los Angeles-based supermarket group which is owned by FSI but not part of
the Chapter 11 process. Campeau itself, which is a large creditor of FSI,
would end up with 14.79 per cent of Ralphs. That would be its only link with
the US stores it once owned.
Whether this will wash with all the creditors is a moot point. Under the US
bankruptcy system, the debtor has a prescribed period when it has the sole
right to file any reorganisation plan. Although there has clearly been some
dialogue with the creditors, Allied and Federated made no attempt to pretend
that Monday's scheme has anyone's blessing. 'Some disagreement on various
aspects of the plan as proposed has been expressed by creditor
representatives,' they conceded, adding 'we would have been surprised if it
were otherwise at this juncture.'
One bone of contention centres on whether assets from within the retail
groups should be sold, thus reducing the size of the merged company (and
increasing the cash outlay).
That said, not all creditors are unenthusiastic about Monday's proposals.
Lawyers for the Federated bondholders' committee - representing about
Dollars 800m of senior secured debt - were quick to say that they 'support
Federated/ Allied's intent to maintain a reasonable level of debt' and are
substantially in favour.
Another grey area, as far as the plan's potential success is concerned, is
the very substantial claim - running to hundred of millions of dollars -
submitted by the Internal Revenue Service. 'It is anticipated that the IRS
and other tax claims will be resolved,' remarked Federated/Allied blandly,
'but we cannot comment on specific amounts at this time'.
Finally, reorganisation details aside, there is still the extremely
difficult US retail climate to contend with. So far, 1991 has been a patchy
year for the two stores groups, and progress on the nation's high streets
may be every bit as tough to achieve as progress in the courtroom.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JOINT Franco-Italian bid for de Havilland, the Canadian aircraft maker
owned by Boeing of the US, should be allowed to go ahead, despite strong
local political and union opposition to the deal, said Mr Fausto Cereti,
chairman of the Italian aerospace group Alenia.
He was speaking at the first shareholders' meeting of Alenia, the company
created by the merger in December of Aeritalia and Selenia, the Italian
state-owned aircraft and defence electronics companies. Mr Cereti confirmed
that Canadian government approval for the de Havilland acquisition was still
some way off.
Negotiations between Alenia and Aerospatiale, its French partner, and
Investment Canada, the Canadian federal body responsible for vetting foreign
investment projects, were 'in a preliminary phase', he said.
Presenting Alenia's first post-merger figures, Mr Cereti announced a sharp
cut in the dividend to L90 a share from the L130 paid by Aeritalia in its
last full year as an independent company in 1989. Selenia was not previously
quoted.
Mr Cereti blamed the decline on new uncertainties in Italian and
international defence spending following the collapse of the eastern bloc.
Changes in Italian defence policy have already damaged Alenia's cash-flow.
Working capital and net borrowing rose sharply last year after the
government's decision to pay a much lower proportion of the value of its
defence contracts in advance. Overall group sales amounted to L4,900bn
(Dollars 3.8bn), while net profits were L101bn.

Brazilian steel mill

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN obstacle hindering Brazil's first significant privatisation - that of
Usiminas, its largest steel mill - was removed yesterday with the signing of
an accord substantially raising the equity of the company's Japanese
shareholders.
After months of negotiations it was agreed that Nippon Usiminas, a Nippon
Steel-led consortium of 54 Japanese companies as well as the Japanese
government, would have its stake in Usiminas increased from 4.6 per cent to
13 per cent.
Usiminas was established in 1958 as a joint Brazilian-Japanese venture to
provide steel for the motor and naval industries. The Japanese put up 52 per
cent of the capital and retained 40 per cent of the equity, the maximum
allowed.
But government price controls on steel to subsidise other industries, and
more recently to keep down inflation, prevented it becoming the profitable
venture envisaged. So, as Brazil increased investment in Usiminas, the
Japanese cut their participation to hold only 25 per cent of the equity.
The real blow came in 1976 when all state steel companies were brought under
the control of Siderbras which, through redirecting tax reimbursements, cut
the equity participation of Nippon Usiminas from 25 per cent to 4.6 per
cent.

PHILIP MORRIS, the US foods and tobacco group, has re-organised Jacobs
Suchard, the Swiss company for which it paid Dollars 3.8bn last year, into a
pan-European chocolate and coffee group which is expected to generate sales
of more than SFr6bn (Dollars 4.1bn) this year.
Mr Raymond Viault, the new chief executive, said yesterday that Jacobs
Suchard had already contributed to the good first-quarter results of its US
parent but he gave no figures.
Philip Morris posted a 21.5 per cent advance to Dollars 942m in net earnings
for the three months.
Of the original Jacobs Suchard operations, Mr Klaus Jacobs, the majority
shareholder, has retained the EJ Brach candy company in the US, the Nabob
coffee business in Canada, the Van Houten bulk chocolate company in Europe
and three small banks.
The Asian, Pacific and Latin American operations have been transferred to
other Philip Morris management divisions, leaving a core European business
with 1990 sales of SFr4.3bn.
To this has been added the Kraft General Foods operations in Scandinavia,
France and Germany.

DOMINION Textile, Canada's only surviving integrated textile group, had big
losses in the third quarter and nine months due to the North American
recession and high raw material costs.
However, it said the denim market, in which it is a North American leader,
and the yarn and carpet-backing markets are showing signs of picking up and
it expects improvement in the final quarter ending June 30.
The third-quarter loss was CDollars 23.4m (Dollars 20.10m), or 73 cents a
share, against a net profit of CDollars 1.5m a year earlier when nothing was
attributable to the common stock after preferred dividends. Sales were
CDollars 302m against CDollars 317m.
The nine months' loss was CDollars 58.5m, or CDollars 1.93 a share, against
net profit of CDollars 16.8m, or 44 cents a share, on sales of CDollars 913m
against CDollars 1bn.

<TEXT>
TENNECO, the Houston-based conglomerate, yesterday turned in a sharp drop in
first-quarter earnings, reflecting the impact of recession in many of its
businesses.
For the first three months of 1991, Tenneco had net income of Dollars 1m
compared with Dollars 134m a year earlier. After deducting preferred stock
dividends from net income, the company had a net loss of 3 cents a share
compared with net income of Dollars 1.03 a year ago. Revenues slid to
Dollars 3.3bn from Dollars 3.6bn in 1990.
During the quarter, operating income before interest and taxes plunged to
Dollars 113m from Dollars 315m.
Mr James Ketelsen, chairman and chief executive, said the company's farm and
construction equipment, container board products and chemicals operations
were hit particularly hard by the recession in the first quarter. 'The
performance of our automotive parts and minerals businesses, while
essentially unchanged from 1990, was good, considering economic conditions.'
Tenneco's pipeline and shipbuilding businesses have proved the most
resistant to recession and both turned in improved first-quarter earnings.
Operating income for Tenneco Gas was Dollars 113m in the quarter against
Dollars 90m a year ago. Operating income from Tenneco's Newport News
Shipbuilding was Dollars 49m against Dollars 45m in 1990.
Tenneco's J. I. Case subsidiary, which makes farm and construction
equipment, has cut its workforce and significantly reduced production to
cope with the impact of recession and help reduce costs and inventories. As
a result of job cuts in Europe, Case took a one-time charge of Dollars 32m
in the latest quarter. The unit had a first quarter operating loss of
Dollars 147m compared with operating income of Dollars 49m the previous
year.
Mr Ketelsen said the disappointing results from Case were in line with
expectations. '1991 will be a difficult year for Case and the farm and
construction equipment industry, but we will continue to make the
disciplined management decisions necessary to adapt to changing business
conditions.
Enron, the natural gas company, reported higher first-quarter earnings and
said it was 'very optimistic' about achieving higher earnings for the 1991
full year amid growth in its power, gas services and liquids units.
It reported a net income of Dollars 108.8m, or Dollars 2.03 per primary
share, compared with Dollars 101.0m, or Dollars 1.88 per share a year ago.
Revenues advanced to Dollars 3.61bn from Dollars 3.07bn.

SQUARE D, the Illinois electrical equipment maker that is fighting off a
takeover bid by France's Groupe Schneider, yesterday postponed its annual
meeting for a second time. The meeting is now scheduled for June 21, rather
than May 24.
The company said the meeting was rescheduled 'so that the substantial legal
issues surrounding Schneider's offer and related proxy solicitation can be
resolved and shareholders can be informed.'
It also set a record date of May 23. A record date is the deadline for those
who want to vote at the annual meeting to acquire shares.
In addition, Square D said it had agreed to a request from Schneider that it
put back a hearing date before the US District Court of the Southern
District of New York on its allegations that Schneider's slate of nominees
for the board of directors would violate US anti-trust laws.
The hearing, originally scheduled for May 9 was fixed instead for May 16, or
such other date as the court decided, the company said. Another federal
court hearing, set for May 13, will weigh Square D's claims that Schneider
has violated confidentiality agreements with it.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL Airlines, the US carrier caught up in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings, last night reported a first-quarter net loss of Dollars 194.8m,
which it blamed on the domestic recession and the impact of the Gulf war on
air travel.
US airlines are generally reporting heavy first-quarter losses, but
Continental is in a more vulnerable financial position than several rivals.
However, Mr Rick Shuyler, chief financial officer, said yesterday he was
optimistic the airline would 'continue to show marked progress with its
restructuring and that the summer months will be quite favourable for the
company'.
Continental said it had a first-quarter operating loss of Dollars 157.8m, on
revenues of Dollars 1.3bn. This compared with operating income of Dollars
8.8m and net income of Dollars 21.3m on revenues of Dollars 1.3bn in the
same period last year.
The results were only for Continental Airlines and not other affiliates of
its holding company, which will report consolidated results soon.
Mr Shuyler said: 'The Gulf war had a significant restraining effect on
worldwide travel, but by the end of the quarter we saw a resurgence in
demand. The recession also challenged our ability to develop traffic and
maintain favourable yields during the first three months of the year.'
Continental is considering a reorganisation involving unsecured creditors of
its parent and the main airline business converting into equity, and
materially diluting, or possibly eliminating the interests of existing
equity-holders.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HIDROLA and Iberduero, Spain's two largest private sector electricity
utilities, formally agreed last night to begin merging. They will create a
new holding company to look at intergrating their generating and
distribution assets.
The new company, HI Holdings, will eventually become the parent of both
companies, Hidrola said.
The two companies account for some 30 per cent of Spanish generating
capacity and are valued at more than Dollars 5bn on the Madrid stock market.
The decision has been taken in the face of government concern that Iberduero
and Hidrola together will control the bulk of Spain's hydro-electrical
capacity.
The government, however, is unlikely to prevent a full merger going ahead.
Madrid has told utilities it wants to restructure totally the electrical
sector this year, to create larger and more competitive generators.
The private companies have been desperately looking for ways to ally with
each other to avoid merging with Endesa, the state-owned utility, which
Madrid wants to see emerge as one of the two or three leaders of a
reorganised sector.
Hidrola and Iberduero have been helped in moving towards a merger by their
large banking shareholders, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and Banesto, who, besides
owning small stakes in the companies, can control up to 30 per cent of votes
at shareholder meetings.

BANCO BILBAO Vizcaya (BBV), Spain's largest retail bank, yesterday reported
a 26 per cent rise in first-quarter cash-flow to Pta70.3bn (Dollars 645m).
Pre-tax profits advanced 6 per cent to Pta31.8bn, writes Tom Burns in

BBV's operating profits of Pta83.9bn were nearly 5 per cent below the
Pta88.4bn reported in the first quarter of last year. However it was 3.4 per
cent up on the Pta83.9bn posted in the final three months of last year.
The bank endured a marked narrowing of its margins in 1990 when it launched
costly financial products during a fierce battle for market share among
Spain's retail banks.
In contrast to BBV, Banco Popular, the Spanish bank 43 per cent-owned by
foreign investors, reported after-tax profits for the quarter of Pta11.6bn,
14.6 per cent up on the same period last year.
A third Spanish bank, Banco Hispano Americano, posted a 0.3 per cent rise in
margins, to Pta23.2bn, and pre-tax profits of Pta13.2bn, an 11.3 per cent
increase on the first quarter of 1990.

FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Rivals celebrate a partial
victory - A business-like conclusion to the Mondadori saga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 16-month feud for Mondadori, which came to an end very early yesterday
morning, has been a long slog for partial victory at best for Mr Carlo De
Benedetti.
Not that his rival, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, has emerged in much better shape
from a corporate battle that even outdid last year's Enimont saga for
duration, vitriol and hints of political manipulation.
But although neither side has gained the prize for which it invested so
heavily, both factions can at least portray this week's agreement to divide
Mondadori as a success.
At the least, the deal finally removes the uncertainty which has dogged both
camps during a battle in which fortunes changed overnight as a result of
surprise court decisions.
Both sides claimed on different occasions that the cards were stacked
against them. While Mr De Benedetti's Cir hinted at political forces in Rome
working against it, Mr Berlusconi consistently lamented the passage of a law
last year which would ultimately oblige him to give up any newspaper
interests.
And throughout, Mondadori itself suffered as talented staff left, urgent
decisions were left unresolved and indebtedness increased. Though sales
should reach about L2,000bn (Dollars 1.5bn) in 1990, the company will barely
break even.
Although Mr De Benedetti and Mr Berlusconi failed to gain full control of
Mondadori, both stressed the advantages of being the unchallenged master of
at least part.
'We are all very satisfied with the accord we have reached,' said Mr De
Benedetti. 'There is a big sense of satisfaction that it is over,' added Mr
Berlusconi later.
Both now claim to have buried the hatchet - at least as far as the cameras
are concerned - and had lunch together yesterday to seal their new
relationship.
Businesslike relations will be essential in view of the fact that the two
will jointly own Manzoni, Mondadori's advertising arm. Apart from the strong
commercial links between the assets now being divided, the two also 'looked
at a whole series of other possibilities of mutual interest', according to
Mr Berlusconi.
Financially, the outcome is mixed at best, at least in the short term. Cir
will realise about L997bn for its Mondadori and Amef shares, leaving a net
profit of about L67bn on its original investment in the group. That is
hardly a re-run of the pasting it took on Societe Generale de Belgique, as
some analysts expected, but not a king's ransom either.
Mr Berlusconi has been even more coy about the financial consequences of the
deal, declining even to name how much his stakes in Mondadori and Amef had
cost.
One reason for both sides' reluctance to be precise about figures is that
the Mondadori affair is still not over, in the sense that further income is
still possible.
The stock market features largely for both. For Mr De Benedetti, full
control of both L'Espresso, which is quoted, and La Repubblica, which is
not, opens the door to substantial cash-raising exercises for both in due
course.
Mr De Benedetti's Cir holding company now owns 88.5 per cent of L'Espresso,
and all of La Repubblica. An early step will be to increase the proportion
of L'Espresso shares quoted publicly from the current 5 per cent to an
appreciably higher figure, he says.
Likewise, market conditions permitting, it should not be long until La
Repubblica makes its stock market debut. It is believed that Cir's purchase
of Cartiera di Ascoli, the Mondadori-owned holding company and one of
Italy's biggest paper makers before selling its productive interests, has
been to gain an already-quoted vehicle to accelerate a future La Repubblica
quotation.
Mr Berlusconi also has his eyes on the bourse as a way of reducing his
financial commitment to the Mondadori affair. Once Mondadori has been merged
with Amef, its holding company, it will probably not be long before he seeks
to issue up to 49 per cent of its stock.
Thus, the real outcome of this week's deal will depend largely on the prices
to be realised on the stock market.

Benchmark, the financial services group, is asking shareholders for Pounds
6m via a rights issue of 107.3m shares at 6p apiece on a 2-for-1 basis. The

Pounds 4.95m pre-tax-after exceptional provisions of Pounds 5.05m compared
with previous profits of Pounds 732,000.
As a result group net asset value fell from Pounds 14m as at June 30 1990 to
Pounds 6.5m at the end of December 1990. This would breach loan covenants,
hence the rights issue. Losses per share totalled 9.23p (earnings 0.88p) and
there is no interim dividend - 0.75p was paid previously. The 20p shares are
being sub-divided into one new ordinary of 5p and one deferred of 15p.

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: March rethink as losses accelerate:
Abortive venture into financial services results in extraordinary cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARCH GROUP, the USM-quoted racing cars and engineering company, has skidded
into a Pounds 3.2m loss after extraordinaries for the year to end-October,
with an abortive venture into financial services and a Pounds 2.6m legal
action against Alfa Romeo to be found among the debris.
The comparable result was a profit of Pounds 970,000.
Mr John Cowen, chairman, pinned the main blame for the reversal on
developments at Cobbold Roach, the Southampton-based stockbroker bought for
Pounds 3.1m in April last year from Elders IXL.
The purchase was intended to form part of a diversification drive aimed at
reducing March's exposure to the volatile world of motor racing.
Cobbold's affairs in the period leading up to February this year are now the
subject of investigations by the The Securities Association and the Fraud
Squad.
They are looking into the apparent misappropriation of Pounds 200,000 of
clients' funds as well as money missing from March itself. Mr James Stewart,
Cobbold's managing director, resigned in February.
Even before the misappropriations issue arose, Cobbold Roach had run up
trading losses of Pounds 1.3m during March's 10 months of ownership.
Of the Pounds 1.85m extraordinary charge Pounds 1.57m related to a provision
for the withdrawal from financial services. There was a Pounds 1.26m
extraordinary credit last time from the sale and reorganisation of the motor
racing businesses, notably the disposal of its grand prix operations to Mr
Akira Akagi's Leyton House organisation.
By last October Cobbold was losing money at an annual rate of Pounds 1m.
March's advisers said it would be possible to sell Cobbold at a price to
cover most of the investment. By December terms had been agreed with an
unnamed buyer.
On the evening of January 24, the scheduled date for the completion of the
sale a Cobbold director expressed concern about a number of client accounts.
By just before midnight, with Cobbold's accounts rushed up from Southampton,
Mr Cowen had talked to all Cobbold directors. At 12.30 the prospective buyer
was warned that irregularities discovered meant the deal would almost
certainly be off.
A month later, the shell of the business and some of its assets were sold
for Pounds 200,000 to Neilson Milnes, a Liverpool-based stockbroker. The
cost of closing what is left of Cobbold are put at Pounds 826,000, including
reimbursing private clients.
The total Pounds 2.1m loss from the venture was described as a bitter pill
by Mr Cowen, the former United Technologies chairman, who since mid-1988 has
been steering March away from what then appeared to be a certain collision
course with receivership.
March is also claiming Pounds 2.6m from Alfa Romeo. The sum represents the
value of a two-year contract for March to develop and supply Alfa
Romeo-engined racing cars for America's most prestigious motor racing
series, the Indy car championship.
The contract covered 1990 and this year. However, March-Alfa Romeos
contested only three races before Patrick Racing, which operates the team
for Alfa, announced it was switching to cars built by Lola, March's chief
rival.
March is claiming substantial damages from Alfa, alleging breach of
contract, and has filed suits alleging defamation, conspiracy and
intentional interference with a third part contract against Patrick Racing.
The contract dispute is scheduled to be settled by arbitration in Geneva in
February next year. Following talks with the company's lawyers on prospects
of winning the case, March's board had decided to make no provisions for the
debt in the latest accounts, said Mr Cowen.
He added that the company would be returning to its engineering and motor
racing roots, but was not forsaking the acquisition trail. March has
shareholders funds of Pounds 6.2m, he pointed out, with an unutilised bank
facility of Pounds 600,000. 'As of this moment we're not geared.'
In the year under review turnover fell to Pounds 14.36m (Pounds 17.44m) and
the pre-tax loss was Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 420,000). The loss per share came
out at 5.4p (1.7p).

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: MGN shares to offer yield of 7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIRROR Group Newspapers shares will be sold bearing a 7 per cent gross
dividend yield, a figure designed to attract private investors.
The public will be free to apply for almost all the shares laid aside for
the UK market. Plans to place a proportion with UK institutions have been
abandoned.
These were the main points which emerged yesterday in last-minute
adjustments to terms of the Pounds 245.5m sale. This amounts to 49 per cent
of MGN shares at 125p each.
Mr Robert Maxwell, the chairman, will be left with a controlling stake. He
gave details of the changes yesterday while announcing that the 196.39m
shares had been underwritten at 125p each.
The 7 per cent notional yield, based on the dividend which the company said
it would have paid if it had been listed throughout 1990, makes the offer
pricing look cheaper than expected. However, Mr Maxwell denied the change
had been prompted by concerns that the shares would prove hard to sell.
Marketing had uncovered 'clear and substantial' interest both within the UK
and overseas, he said.
Citing strong demand from abroad, particularly in the US, MGN will increase
the overseas share allocation to 40 per cent of the total, up from 33 per
cent.
On the pricing, advisers stressed that the pro forma historic p/e ratio, 10
at the offer price, meant that the rating on the shares was higher than many
had envisaged.
They said the higher yield provided by a pro forma 6.55p net dividend had
been introduced to make them attractive to the private investor. It reduces
dividend cover on notional 12.5p earnings per share to 1.9 times.
The tabloid-sized prospectus, published yesterday, shows 1990 pro forma
pre-tax profits of Pounds 83.4m.
Applicants have until May 9 to submit forms which must be for 200 shares or
more. The basis of allocation will be announced on May 14 and trading begins
on May 21.

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Etam attacks Oceana stakebuilding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ETAM, the 250-store women's fashion chain, has attacked the attempt by
Oceana Investment Corporation to increase its stake to 25.1 per cent as a
prelude to a possible full bid.
Oceana, investment vehicle of a South African retailing family, launched a
Pounds 22m tender offer for 18.5 per cent of Etam's shares yesterday.
But in a letter to shareholders, Etam said the offer of up to 185p per share
was an attempt to gain back-door control at a low price.
Although the maximum offer is nearly 25 times 1990-91 earnings per share, on
halved pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.5m, Etam said it was only 11 times the
figure achieved when taxable profit exceeded Pounds 17m, as it did in each
of the three years to January 1990.
Oceana was aiming to profit from the benefits to come of Etam's Pounds 78m
investment over the past four years and the upturn in the retail cycle. In
adverse trading conditions, the group had increased market share by
appealing to a broader range of customers.
The board, which holds 10.2 per cent of the equity, would be refusing the
offer and it urged other shareholders to do the same.

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Amstrad's UK chief dismissed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, the electronics company, has responded to difficult trading
conditions by dismissing the managing director of its UK operation.
Mr Barry Young was one of 37 employees to be made redundant. The
redundancies include 31 staff at Amstrad's headquarters in Brentwood, Essex.
The remainder are warehouse and clerical employees at other sites.
Mr Alan Sugar, chairman, said yesterday that he and the company's board
would take direct control of UK operations.
Amstrad's UK sales, which last year accounted for 44 per cent of turnover,
have been badly affected by the recession and the downturn in consumer
spending.
Mr Young was appointed to head the UK company in 1989, allowing the board to
concentrate on running overseas subsidiaries and on cutting costs and
inventories.
Mr Sugar said: 'When times are difficult, it is important for us to bring
back the first eleven and to cut back on our overheads.
'The overall management structure we put in place some time ago to run our
international and UK businesses has worked well and remains firmly in
place.'

FT  01 MAY 91 / Coats Viyella raises Tootal offer from Pounds 194m to Pounds
252m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COATS VIYELLA, Europe's largest textile group, yesterday fired the latest
salvo in its increasingly bitter bid battle for the Tootal textile group by
raising its offer from Pounds 194m to Pounds 252m.
Tootal, which responded by rejecting the new offer, plans next week to mount
new arguments for its defence in which it will criticise what Mr Anthony
Habgood, chief executive, called Coats' 'appalling' commercial record and
its 'imprudent' accountancy practices.
Coats yesterday also mounted a dawn raid on Tootal's shares. It instructed
its brokers - Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Cazenove - to buy up to 65m Tootal
shares for 83.05p, just below the new cash and shares offer of 83.3p.
Stock market speculation suggested that Coats, which already owned 29.4 per
cent of Tootal, managed to buy at least 7m shares during the day. Tootal's
shares rose 5p to 84p and Coats' fell 3p to 138p.
The new Coats bid offers 23 of its new shares and Pounds 51.02 in cash for
every 100 Tootal shares. Tootal's investors will be entitled to receive the
net final dividend of 3.05p proposed for the 1990/91 financial year. Coats
also offered its cash alternative of 83.05p. Tootal's shareholders are
allowed to receive a higher proportion of the offer in Coats' new shares or
in loan notes.
The battle between Coats and Tootal, two of the largest players in UK
textiles with significant interests in the international sewing thread
market, began in March when Coats unveiled its Pounds 194m hostile bid.
Two years ago Coats and Tootal agreed terms for a merger. But that was put
on ice when the Monopolies and Mergers Commission began an investigation
into the proposal. Tootal has fought fiercely against the hostile bid
arguing that it should remain independent to implement the new strategy
developed by Mr Habgood, who was promoted to chief executive earlier this
year.
A main theme of its defence is that the benefits of merger would be less
than Coats has forecast. Tootal claims the combined group would be so large
it could lose market share in international thread and UK clothing. Coats
has dimissed this criticism.

FT  01 MAY 91 / BSkyB partners in Pounds 200m refinance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAJOR shareholders of British Sky Broadcasting, the five-channel
satellite television consortium, were last night signing legally binding
heads of agreement on a Pounds 200m financial package for the venture.
Agreement between the partners came almost at the last minute after
prolonged negotiations. BSkyB, the consortium formed in November from the
merger of British Satellite Broadcasting and Mr Rupert Murdoch's Sky
Television, would have run out of money later this week without new money
being injected.
Mr Murdoch's News Corporation has come up with a sizeable chunk of cash
towards its Pounds 100m share of the refinancing but most of its
contribution to the high-risk venture is in kind through contributions such
as film rights.
Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times and Chargeurs, the French
transport and communications company, not only put in their own share but
took up the slack after last week's decision by Reed International not to
put in any more money.
As a result, their stakes were increased to around 15 per cent each, while
Reed's will be diluted from 10 per cent to 4 per cent. Granada, despite
continuing controversy over both its top management and the company's
strategy, put in its share of about Pounds 25m. The money is designed to
take the satellite venture through to the end of next year.
Pearson executives recently predicted the project would break even in 1993.
The total commitment in equity, loans and guarantees until now has reached
Pounds 1.4bn.
After the merger, the plan was to raise a Pounds 300m project loan to be
organised by Barclays Bank. The partners decided to raise Pounds 200m
themselves because it is believed they could not get the terms they wanted
without guarantees.
The BSkyB channels are now available to around 2m UK homes through
individual dishes and cable networks.
The last-minute refinancing comes as dish sales start to accelerate. Sales
are expected to top 70,000 in April. The satellite service has recently been
promoted on television since the creation of a merged five-channel service
on both the BSB and Astra satellites. Under a special offer, remote control
satellite receivers are being sold at Pounds 199.99. BSkyB is still losing
close to Pounds 6m a week, compared with Pounds 9.7m at the time of the
merger.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Budgens moves to oust chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Budgens, the neighbourhood grocery stores chain, met last night
to decide terms on which its chairman, Mr John Fletcher, should leave the
company, following a revolt by institutional shareholders.
The hastily convened meeting followed a call late on Monday by institutions
controlling 27 per cent of Budgens stock for an extraordinary general
meeting to install a new management team.
Lloyds Merchant Bank said that the institutions - including IEP Securities
(founded by Sir Ron Brierley), Electra and Gartmore - had called for the
meeting because of Budgen's 'extremely poor track record, both in absolute
terms and by reference to the sector.'
Since 1987 the Budgens price has fallen from a high of 252p to 45p at
yesterday's close.
The institutions have recommended the appointment as chief executive of Mr
John von Spreckelsen, who helped turn around the KAFU-Wasmund
Handelsgesellschaft supermarket chain in Germany, Mr Christian Williams, who
worked on the same project, and Mr Graham Rigby, formerly of BTR.
Mr Fletcher's likely departure from Budgens would appear to bring an end to
a roller-coaster retailing career. This included a stint as managing
director of the Asda superstore group until an abrupt departure in 1984, and
a failed bid through Budgens to take over Gateway in 1987.
His departure may also cost Budgens more than the interim dividend which it
decided not to pay in February following a collapse in profits, a move which
triggered the institutional revolt against Mr Fletcher.
Shortly after Budgens declined to pay the dividend, Mr Fletcher's service
contract of Pounds 145,000 a year was extended from three to five years.
Budgens' only non-executive director before yesterday's meeting was Mr
Martin Sorrell, the chairman of WPP.
Before the Budgens' board meeting Mr von Spreckelsen said he believed that
smaller high-street retailers could compete with superstores such as Tesco
and J. Sainsbury. 'Some well-run stores have made good contributions,' he
said. 'Some shops should become more competitive locally.' He promised an
immediate review of locations if the board changes went through.
However, some analysts said Budgens still faced an uphill struggle even
after a board change. The company has run into difficulties with a new
distribution depot where overheads are too high for the group's sales and
stock control has been a problem.

FT  01 MAY 91 / A slow road to the modern world: Ford remains optimistic
despite Jaguar's mounting losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford's takeover of Jaguar, the UK luxury carmaker, appears - in the short
term - to have been an unmitigated disaster.
Losses are mounting, as sales and production plummet. Demand for luxury cars
in Jaguar's two biggest markets, the US and the UK, seems to be in freefall.
Worldwide sales in the first quarter have fallen 45.4 per cent and
production 57.8 per cent.
Amid the gloom, however, Jaguar chairman Bill Hayden insists that there are
glimmers of hope. Mr Hayden, previously vice-president of Ford of Europe's
manufacturing group, came to Jaguar after the US carmaker's takeover 16
months ago. He says the first benefits of the company's landmark 1991-92
labour agreement are beginning to show through in much higher productivity;
and, he adds, Jaguar is set to reach quality levels with the launch today of
a revamped XJS coupe and convertible range, which it had previously never
dreamed of attaining.
The takeover was hardly cheap. Ford paid Pounds 1.38bn to gain its foothold
in the world luxury car market. It is competing head on with the most
prestigious German luxury car makers - Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Porsche - as
well as with the upstart competition from Japan - Toyota's Lexus and
Nissan's Infiniti ranges.
To make matters worse, Ford - which is the world's second-largest car
producer - made its play for Jaguar just before the bottom began to drop out
of its own core North American automotive operations, and its profits began
to plunge in Europe.
In the final quarter last year, the Ford group ran up a net loss of Dollars
519m (Pounds 307.1m), its first quarterly loss for eight years. Yesterday it
announced an Dollars 884m loss for the first quarter of 1991.
It was clear from the outset that the Jaguar name, rather than the physical
assets, was the attraction. Of the Pounds 1.38bn purchase price, the net
assets were valued at Pounds 249m, while the goodwill cost Pounds 1.133bn.
Ford never expected too much of the plants. Yet within months of arriving at
Jaguar, Mr Hayden was declaring publicly that he was 'appalled'.
In one interview, he said: 'I've been to car plants around the world. Apart
from some Russian factories in Gorky, Jaguar's factory was the worst I'd
ever seen.'
Jaguar management admits that the first 16 months of Ford ownership has been
traumatic. But the company insists substantial progress is being made in
modernising its manufacturing and product development operations.
'Jaguar was quite an introverted company,' says Mr Hayden, 'it muddled
through but was not aware of competitive standards outside.'
Undoubtedly helped by the rapidly worsening economic environment, Jaguar has
managed to revolutionise its labour practices. The two-year agreement
reached last November represents the biggest change in working practices in
the company's history. It has finally eradicated shopfloor arrangements
which had been defunct elsewhere in the UK motor industry for 10 to 15
years.
Mr Hayden says that direct labour productivity in the current year will be
about 18 per cent higher than a year ago.
'We were not in a position to put industrial engineers on the shopfloor to
time standard work and carry out process checks. Now we can and do.'
The notorious system of 'job and finish' - whereby there was a tacit
agreement that workers left the assembly line when a certain number of units
had been produced, regardless of when the shift ended - has now been
stopped. 'There is now 'bell-to-bell working'.
Mr Hayden claims that the demarcation lines among the semi-skilled workers
have been abolished. 'Before jobs were allocated by the unions. It was a
metal finisher's job or a TGWU (Transport and General Workers Union) job.
You could not allocate one to the other. Changing schedules or re-manning
the lines was impossible.'
Jaguar workers had also previously refused to take on tasks outside their
narrowly-defined duties, such as detailing problems, assisting in
statistical process control or carrying out quality calculations. 'All that
has gone,' says Mr Hayden.
At the same time, group leaders are being appointed from among the hourly
workers to assist in tracking quality and production problems.
The unions previously decided the allocation of overtime. Management has now
regained control, although it publishes its requirements to avoid suspicions
it is abusing its newly won powers.
Ford's ownership of Jaguar has had an equally purgative affect on the
company's engineering and product development functions. Long-held plans for
a new sports car - the heir to Jaguar's legendary E-Type - were finally
scrapped last year. The company realised it was unable to meet the cost,
specification and performance criteria which it had established for the
project.
At the same time, the management put in place by Ford has insisted on tough
quality standards. The launch of the revamped XJS coupe and convertible
range has been delayed for about four months until the required standards
could be reached. Jaguar has spent about Pounds 50m on revising the range -
priced from Pounds 33,400 to Pounds 50,600. The revisions amount to the most
comprehensive changes made since the XJS was launched in 1975.
Mr Hayden has introduced Ford's uniform product assessment system for
measuring quality. He insists that the new XJS will be introduced with the
defects per vehicle cut to only one-third the level of a year ago.
Jaguar is also moving quickly to address weaknesses in its worldwide
distribution and dealer network, particularly in Europe.
In the long-term, Ford has heady ambitions for Jaguar. The company plans to
more than treble output by the end of the decade to over 150,000 cars a
year. It will do this by replacing its XJ6 luxury saloon range and also
introducing a smaller, sportier Jaguar model to challenge the likes of the
BMW 3 and 5 Series.
The ambitions will cost another Pounds 1bn, however, for development and
capital investment costs, and Ford will need a steady nerve in its present
troubled times.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Deadlock is broken on stance in Tokyo car talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday ended months of wrangling over the
Community's bargaining position with Tokyo on car imports when commissioners
voted 13-2 in favour of a pack-age of negotiating prin-ciples.
These include eliminating by the start of 1993 remaining national
restrictions on Japanese cars coming into the EC, and monitoring the level
of Japanese cars imported or made in the EC until the end of 1998 or 1999,
after which time the EC will have a totally free car market.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC Competition Commissioner, said he was delighted
that the principles upheld by him and fellow trade liberals in the
Commission - Mr Frans Andriessen, responsible for external relations, and Mr
Martin Bangemann, respon-sible for industry - had prevailed.
Two commissioners, Mr Bruce Millan from the UK and Mr Ray MacSharry from
Ireland, voted against the car proposals in person, while one of two other
commissioners absent, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana from Italy, did so by letter.
Mr Millan, in spite of coming from the EC country with the most Japanese car
manufacturing, objected that by failing to demand 'global reciprocity' in
market-opening from Japan, the EC was unilaterally disarming itself.
In the next few weeks, the Commission will inform, but not seek the formal
approval of, the EC Council of Ministers on what it hopes to negotiate with
Tokyo.
To offset some of the risks to European car makers, Brussels will also come
up with a research and development programme to fit the EC car industry
better to meet Japanese competition by the end of the century.
Such is the sensitivity of the Japanese car issue that the Commission
refused to make public its negotiating stance, beyond confirming that at
last it had one.
However, it is understood to comprise:
Removal by the end of next year of curbs on Japanese cars in France, Italy,
the UK, Spain and Portugal.
Thereafter Tokyo and Brussels will keep a count of Japanese cars shipped
directly from Japan and so-called transplants made in the EC.
This would last until 1998 or 1999, when the total number of Japanese-made
(transplants and imports) cars would be about 2.5m.
At present Japan has 10.5 per cent of total annual car sales of 13m in the
EC and, of this share, 260,000 cars are made locally.
EC and Japanese officials will consult every six months on market trends.
If the EC feels too many Japanese cars are com-ing on the market, it will
ask Tokyo to reduce the growth in direct shipments, but not in locally
assembled cars.

FT  01 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Budgens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the swiftness with which a few institutional investors appear to
have rolled over Budgens' management, it is tempting to conclude that there
was not much left in the company worth fighting for beyond the chairman's
compensation package. Whether the institutions picked the right fight is
another matter.
At this point, it is unclear how the new team proposes to turn the company
around. The problems appear daunting enough to make one wonder whether the
shop doors are being closed far too late. Budgens lacks the critical mass
with which to compete against rival food retailers. In recent years, it has
spent far too much on fancy distribution facilities which are not being
fully utilised. As a consequence, the interest charge is rising and the
balance sheet is deteriorating. Much-needed sale and leaseback deals on its
properties will remain a distant prospect until the property market
improves.
It would be a shame if the move towards better corporate governance were to
be deflected by the odd mistake. But a year from now, it may just be that
the institutions will wish they had cut their losses and sold their shares.

Investors who cannot be bothered to wade through the MGN prospectus can
always make a simple comparison with United Newspapers. MGN's 7 per cent

and p/e of 12, especially when you bear in mind that shareholders in Mr

Nevertheless, the prospectus does contain some odd nuggets. There is a
mysteriously low 1990 charge of Pounds 4.1m for operating lease rentals,
down from Pounds 10m the previous year. Given that this year the lease on
group headquarters alone will cost Pounds 7m, the overall charge seems bound
to rise, eating into operating profits. The profit and loss account is
boosted by an Pounds 8.5m pension credit which, although likely to be
repeated for a few years, is a non-cash item. A simple adjustment for these
two figures gives a much lower attributable profit. Earnings per share could
be re-stated at less than 10p, against 12.5p, pushing the rating to a heady
13 times earnings.
But perhaps this is to be too pedantic. After all, there are other
questions, such as whether planned group capital expenditure will offset the
potential tax liability arising from the group's treatment of accelerated
capital allowances and timing differences. Or whether associated companies,
particularly Donohue in Canada, can repeat their Pounds 16m contribution to
profits. Or whether the low interest charge of Pounds 60m on year-end debt
of Pounds 558m is sustainable. Perhaps investors will conclude that the
precise rating on which the shares are floated is of no great importance
after all.

FT  01 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Coats/Tootal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in Coats Viyella and Tootal must be getting fed up. Their
investments have badly underperformed in recent years and the market for UK
textiles is as tough as anyone can remember. Yet far from knuckling down to
sort out their problems, the two companies are bogged down in a bitter
takeover battle which could become self destructive.
That said, Coats' improved offer has been cleverly pitched, even if it is
not exactly a knock-out blow. It still falls short of what Tootal believes
it is worth on the basis of the sector's average multiple. But then the
offer of shares and cash is not bad when you bear in mind that it represents
10 and a half times Tootal's own earnings forecast just two months into its
financial year. No-one is saying that Tootal cannot meet that forecast, but
there must be question marks over the 25 per cent tax charge in the longer
term. The offer is also substantially in excess of net asset value, which
will surely be noted by those who have suffered the successive
disappointments of the last decade.
There is a dilemma, though, even for those who decide that the price is
right. There should be no earnings dilution in the combined group, but the
balance sheet will end up looking stretched. A large goodwill write-off
implies that gearing (counting the preference shares as debt) could be of
the order of 75 per cent. That does not leave much room for manoeuvre if the
upturn disappoints and the US dollar goes the wrong way.

FT-SE Index: 2,486.2 (-12.0)
George Bush is not due to face the US electorate until November 1992, over
four months after the latest date that the UK government can go to the
polls. You would not think so from the public frenzy with which the US
authorities are tackling their recession - most obviously in the G7
arm-twisting that preceded yesterday's discount rate cut. The UK
government's relative sang-froid is all the more striking given that some
forecasters are starting to use 4m as the likely unemployment figure next
year and that one manufacturing job in 20 has gone in the past 12 months.
The chancellor can find some comfort in yesterday's Confederation of British
Industry quarterly industrial trends survey. The survey suggests that while
the turning point in the economic cycle may yet be a few months away, the
turning point in business optimism is already with us. That might be enough
to leave the government's - and the market's - expectation of a second-half
economic recovery broadly on schedule.
But the nagging question for the market is whether the upturn will prove
quite as profitable as it has been expecting. Worryingly, the CBI survey
reports a collapse of margins earlier this year as rapidly rising unit costs
slammed into prices which appear to have been slowed much more sharply than
official indicators have suggested.
Looking ahead to the summer, manufacturers' expectations of domestic price
rises are the lowest for 23 years. Those sectors most exposed to
international competition are predicting actual price cuts. The rise in the
dollar may have left industry feeling better about its ability to compete in
export markets; but if the domestic market is to be undermined by lower cost
ERM-based competitors, some, at least, of the currently discounted recovery
in corporate profitability is at risk.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Lilley says DTI will promote competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPETITION and the extension of a competitive environment will be the basis
of the government's industrial policy for the 1990s, Mr Peter Lilley, the
trade and industry secretary, said yesterday.
'It is vigorous competition in home markets which makes industry competitive
globally; domestic monopoly and protection from foreign competition
ultimately undermine its competitiveness,' he told the Institute of
Directors in Birmingham.
Setting out a series of revised objectives for the Department of Trade and
Industry, Mr Lilley produced a characteristically firm statement of free
market principles but no initiatives other than administrative changes in
departmental programmes.
In the competitive environment Mr Lilley is concerned to foster, the
government's role would be restricted to taking the steps necessary for
creating and maintaining a competitive market, financing research, fostering
collaboration between companies and providing mechanisms for 'the spread of
best practice from one business to another.'
His definition of objectives represented a polishing of the department's
practice during the Thatcher years - Mr Lilley described what he had to say
as 'an evolution of policy; you would not expect me to be the author of a
U-turn'.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry spokesman, dismissed Mr Lilley's
speech as 'a vacuous public relations exercise.'
Mr Lilley's vision of industrial policy is less interventionist than that of
Labour, whose latest policy documents promise regional aid with measures and
state funding to support manufacturing and to promote research and
development.
Mr Lilley said only competition would encourage commercial innovation. He
conceded that 'there is little market incentive to undertake pure research',
so the government had to contribute to its cost. Yet the idea that
'government spending on the science base automatically generates a
commercial spin-off and that all we need is more government spending is
manifestly untrue.' Industry and science had to work together.

FT  01 MAY 91 / ECGD unit may go to foreign buyer: Troubled government sale
branded 'a shambles' as it loses last British bidder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERSEAS companies emerged as the most likely winners in the privatisation
of part of the Export Credits Guarantee Department as the deadline for bids
expired yesterday.
The government's sale effort, which has been dogged by a series of
embarrassing setbacks, took another battering after Trade Indemnity, the
last remaining British bidder, declined to put any money on the table.
Trade Indemnity said it made a proposal to collaborate with the government
in export credit insurance but this did not involve a monetary offer to buy
ECGD's short-term export credit insurance business which is for sale.
Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, will now have to abandon the
sale or allow the business to pass, probably at a knock-down price, to one
of the only two foreign bidders - Italy's Assicurazioni Generali and NCM of
the Netherlands.
Mr John Hollows, deputy chairman of the British Exporters Association, said
the privatisation was turning into 'a shambles'. He blamed the earlier
withdrawal of Eagle Star, Sun Alliance and Cobac, the privately-owned
Belgian company, on the government's refusal to make an irrevocable
commitment to continue underwriting credits to politically risky developing
countries after the privatisation.
Trade Indemnity's interest in buying the Cardiff-based division has waned
noticeably in recent weeks as it digested a Pounds 29m loss for 1990 amid
fears that its shareholders would baulk at the rights issue needed to
finance a bid.
However, potential bidders have also been disappointed by government sale
documents which reveal limited profit potential at the ECGD division. This
has added to their worries about the strength of its customer base in the
absence of an ability to offer political risk cover on the back of a
government reinsurance scheme.
The privatised company would also be impeded in Europe by tax regulations
treating mandatory reserve requirements on British credit insurance
companies less favourably than those of other community countries.
The government is expected to proceed with the next stage of the sale - an
evaluation of the offers received - followed in about a month's time by the
selection of a preferred bidder.
Although the deal is expected to yield only a minimal return, the government
has paid heavily in embarrassment. After quashing a Commons backbench
rebellion, it has now had to postpone debate of the legislation in the House
of Lords to fend off revolt there.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, will discuss political risk with
exporters, who hope he will offer a commitment to an improved facility along
the lines of those open to companies in continental Europe.

<TEXT>
In his Economic Viewpoint (this page, April 18) Samuel Brittan claimed that
Labour's new programme is a return to the policies of the 1960s, was
contemptuous even of the idea of policies for industry, and, astonishingly,
attacked the importance Labour attaches to the best training qualifications
for young people. 'Can you imagine Isambard Kingdom Brunel bothering to
acquire an NVQ (national vocational qualification)? Would he have passed if
he had tried?' he asked.
First Brittan on Brunel: far from being a self-made man Brunel enjoyed the
most thorough of educations. He was sent to a carefully selected school in
Normandy; then to the Lycee Henri IV in Paris (the foremost mathematical
college of its day); then on to an apprenticeship with a leading designer of
scientific instruments.
Of course a hands-off-everything enthusiast for liberal economics would have
preferred him to have sat up late at home with borrowed books, tinkering in
the garden shed and then blossoming to genius without access to the
market-distorting influences of a national institution of higher technical
learning, but the facts are all against this view.
Just as Mr Brittan is wrong about the importance of education to Brunel, he
is wrong too - unlike industry itself and our competitors - about the
importance of education and training to the economy. The NCVQ - which
unifies a disparate and confusing jumble of qualifications - may not succeed
in discovering a hundred future Brunels in Brixton and Birmingham. But it
offers young people all over the UK a better chance than ever before of
reaching a nationally recognised level of training comparable to the
education they might - in many cases ought to - have received if they had
stayed at school.
Labour's argument is that in the late 20th century, when education and
training are even more important to industry than in the early 19th, Britain
is slipping dangerously behind its competitors. Inventions can be bought
across frontiers: only rarely can skills. Where the wealth of nations, and
their competitive advantages, used to depend on raw materials, and on the
inventions of a few, it now depends more and more on the skills,
adaptability and collective effort of the many and it is by the application
of technology through a skilled workforce that countries will succeed. To
trust the market simply as a matter of ideology and to imply that there is
no skills gap that industry, left to itself and the working of the invisible
hand, cannot solve on its own, is quite wrong. The evidence of our
deficiencies in training are there for all to see.
Yet despite all the experience of more successful economies we still hear
the argument that government does best when government does nothing:
likewise that there is no technological challenge the free market cannot
normally solve on its own; no long-term investment gap that needs any action
by government; and of course no long-term problem of regional imbalance that
cannot be settled by waiting until free market neglect begets free market
opportunity.
Yet, as the recent economic achievements of Germany, Japan and France
demonstrate, the facts are otherwise. The view that government should do
nothing is as obsolete as its opposite, that the government can and should
do everything. Nineteenth-century theories of competition have a diminishing
relevance to the 21st century search for competitiveness. For there is
clearly a national interest in working to achieve the best technology and
training - something which goes beyond the particular interest of one
employer and which cannot be left solely to the hazards of the market on its
own.
Mr Brittan accuses Labour of being trapped in the past; it is in fact Mr
Brittan who has failed to break out of the past, unwilling to recognise that
the starting point of Labour's approach is that neither the tired ideology
of crude free market dogma nor that of the command economy has any residual
relevance.
So when Mr Brittan argues that 'it is not possible for a market economist to
support Labour with a straight face', he fails to appreciate that the
difference between the Labour and Conservative parties is not over the
importance of markets but in Labour's recognition of their limitations and
governments' corresponding responsibilities.
Mr Brittan fails to mention the significance our new policy programme
accords to stability in macroeconomic policy - a far cry from the stop-go
economics which have bedevilled our country with two deep recessions despite
the opportunities of North Sea oil; nor the importance we attach to
membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Within these disciplines the job of government is not to replace
decision-making in industry but to work with industry to meet common
objectives - the specific tasks of improving our skills, upgrading our
technological capabilities, encouraging long-term investment and ensuring
regionally balanced economic growth. Our document is quite specific in
rejecting 'indiscriminate subsidies or second-guessing industry'. Indeed the
public interest is not in politicians trying to make decisions that
companies must make - as in our encouragement of technology trusts,
universities and industry, and of a national training strategy locally
delivered - but in ensuring that specific tasks vital to our long-term
economic effort are accomplished.
Mr Brittan's examination of our document has been so cursory that he
misnames the National Investment Bank as a Board and misunderstands its
role, which is to bring together the public and private sectors with a view
to encouraging new infrastructure investment.
Our Manufacturing Investment Initiative is not simply designed to end what
many agree has been discrimination against manufacturing through 12 years of
neglect; it recognises that a modern industrial economy, and the vitality of
the service sector within it, requires modern manufacturing strength.
Britain has lost more manufacturing capacity than any other western European
country in the last 12 years, falling near the bottom of the manufacturing
growth league.
To affirm manufacturing's importance is not to yearn irrationally for a
bygone industrial age but to recognise what our competitors understand: that
it is the principal trading part of the economy. Services and manufacturing
are not starkly exclusive alternatives: they complement each other and feed
on each other's success.
If Labour is so wrong, Mr Brittan must explain why so many overseas
governments of all complexions have pursued similar policies with success
and now regard what we say as commonplace and non-controversial. And if he
agrees with the policies of his one-time co-author, the current industry
secretary, he must also explain why at the end of 12 years of Conservative
government we have had the worst series of trade deficits in our history, a
contraction of industrial capacity as Britain slips further behind, and now
the fastest-rising unemployment in western Europe.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Bureaucrats in the heart of the battle: India's election
campaign has taken on an anti-establishment tone - and one target is the
elite civil service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Indian politics has grown more embittered over issues of religion, caste
and regional autonomy, so the western-educated civil service that has
piloted the country since independence is cracking under the strains.
In the run-up to the general election during the week of May 20, the senior
bureaucracy has come under attack on different fronts in campaigns that have
a strong anti-establishment flavour: Former prime minister V P Singh's
left-wing National Front alliance is campaigning on a programme that would
reserve for the poor and lower castes up to 59 per cent of central
government jobs. Mr Singh's revolutionary aim is to wrest control of the
bureaucracy from the upper castes and thus diminish their grip on patronage
and wealth.
Hindu revivalists are angry at the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) - the
elite service that heads the bureaucracy - for upholding secular policies
that they regard as 'pampering Moslems'. The revivalists are contemptuous of
the pro-western, modernising legacy of Jawaharlal Nehru which is reflected
in the IAS.
A growing number of regional movements blame the IAS - often called the
'steel frame' of the Indian union because it provides the link between the
central government and the states - for the country's much-hated
over-centralisation.
The most recent factor in this growing impatience with the civil service is
the current state of the Indian economy. Mismanagement has brought the
country close to defaulting on its international debt and has focused
attention on the shortcomings of the administration in steering economic
development. The civil service is increasingly viewed as one of the major
obstacles to change.
Mr Sam Pitroda, the US-educated Indian electronics engineer who now heads
the telecommunications commission, says: 'There are many capable, highly
motivated bureaucrats. Individually they are innovative. But collectively
they are a roadblock.'
Most worryingly, senior officials seem themselves to have lost confidence in
the system. Under pressure from ruling parties to adopt an increasingly
partisan and political role, looked down on by business which feels that
they easily succumb to bribes, pushed around by criminals who are openly
seeking respectability by entering politics, the IAS has lost its reputation
as a neutral, non-partisan institution.
'Why is it that bureaucrats like to lick the boots of politicians?' one
senior official recalls being asked by one of the new, rough-necked
politicians who had just taken up a post as a central government minister.
In a recent issue of the Indian Journal of Public Administration devoted to
the declining morale in government service, Mr S K Sarkar, a former IAS
officer, begins an article by saying: 'As a member of the Indian
Administrative Service, I have felt considerable anguish in recent years as
a mute spectator to the impending collapse of the civil service in India . .
.'
One indicator of this downward slide is that the best and brightest of
Indian university students are seeking careers elsewhere in management, with
multinationals or in foreign banks. Above all, children of IAS officers shun
a career in a service that was regarded under British rule and until
recently as the pinnacle of achievement.
Most new recruits to the IAS are now coming from the two northern states of
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar - the largest of the 25 states and where corruption
is most endemic and the collapse of administration most apparent.
As the central government has grown weaker and more strife-prone, it has
fallen increasingly to civil servants to keep the wheels turning. But it is
increasingly clear that the civil service cannot function without political
leadership, and that left to itself there is a risk of disruption and
paralysis. If the election fails to produce a central government with a
stable majority, the civil service will fall increasingly prey to caste,
religious, regional, farmers or business lobbies. India has no tradition -
as does France or Italy, for example  - of a civil service providing
continuity in the face of political turmoil.
However, if a strong government or coalition should emerge, then it is
difficult to see how much-needed reforms - decentralisation, deregulation of
industry and improving the performance of the public sector - can be
achieved without an overhaul of the civil service.
The paradox is that the civil service contains many able people but its
performance has been poor. Its main defect since independence has been that
it has failed to adapt the elitist structure left by a colonial power to the
more diverse needs of a developing country democracy.
Britain ruled India through the Indian Civil Service (ICS) - a hand-picked
cadre of 1,000 men imbued with Victorian ideals of hard work, honesty and
dedication, who provided a secretariat for the viceroy and managed districts
the size of a small state.
Some of that ethos is still preserved at Mussoorie, the hill station academy
that trains recruits to the successor IAS service. They are still taught to
ride 'as part of the old belief that if you can't ride a horse you won't be
able to manage a district'. As a colonial service, the ICS was only
concerned with tax collection and law and order. Since independence in 1947
the IAS has taken over most of the welfare and economic responsibilities of
a modern state, including co-ordination of education, health and irrigation.
Its numbers have only increased to 5,000 for a population that has exploded
to 840m.
It is thus overstretched. It presides over a mammoth bureaucracy that
numbers 4m officials in the central government alone. Files can take months
to move back and forth. The IAS recruits a third of its intake by
competitive examination. Each year about 250,000 students apply to take the
civil service exams of which about the first 100 are admitted to the IAS.
In the hierarchy of the IAS, an officer moves up by seniority from a
district post to being a secretary of government (in charge of a department)
or even cabinet secretary. Each officer is attached to a state but is loaned
at different periods in his career to the central government - a structure
intended to minimise separatism in the union and establish a link between
the centre and the states.
Many senior civil servants blame venal, short-sighted politicians for
destroying the IAS's reputation as an honest, non-partisan service. Others
accept that 'civil servants have been their own worst enemies' - too often
sycophantic, fearful of taking a stand against abuses, and financially
profiting from their immense power.
Mr Ajit Mazumdar, a former secretary in the finance ministry, sees the
emergency imposed by Mrs Indira Gandhi in the 1970s to thwart opposition to
her as a watershed. During that time, the administration failed to resist
abuses of the law and constitution by the then prime minister. 'To our
eternal shame none of us resigned,' he said, 'though we felt that wrong
things were being done.'
Since then both state governments and the central government have
increasingly expected senior officials to promote the short-term political
and financial interests of the party in power - transferring those who
refused to toe the line.
As one of the main instruments of economic development, the IAS has tended
to be ultra-cautious - giving priority to issues of social justice and
equitable income distribution over the willingness to take risks that
accompanies higher economic growth.
Part of that reluctance to encourage the risk-taking enterprises that
promote a market economy is a legacy of British rule. After independence the
government left in place a system of war-time controls to regulate industry
and the economy. This went hand in hand with an acceptance of Fabian
socialist beliefs. Intervention was seen as the most efficient instrument
with which to accelerate economic development and to achieve social justice.
Neither has been completely abandoned.
But in the 1980s there were several attempts to shift towards a more market
economy. Mr Rajiv Gandhi began his term as prime minister in 1985 with a
reformist programme of economic liberalisation.
A year ago, when warning signals were already flashing of an approaching
fiscal and balance of payments crisis, Mr Montek Ahluwahlia, then chief
economic adviser to Mr V P Singh, circulated as a cabinet paper a
far-reaching programme of medium-term economic and structural change that
linked deficit-cutting to financial sector and tariff reform. Both ran into
opposition in the bureaucracy.
Change in India must proceed at a pace that is 'politically and socially
sustainable', says Mr Bimal Jalan, finance secretary at the time. Another
senior official says: 'The system is not a speedy system and just as well.
India is not a country on the fast track. It is too dangerous. There would
be risks of arbitrariness, lack of fair play and injustice.'
A gap in the system is that there is no mechanism for studying medium-term
policy options. India has no think-tank with the weight to influence
decisions, or a 'reforms commission' such as China introduced to co-ordinate
economic change. The planning commission - the closest equivalent - is
concerned with the long-term allocation of resources.
A further problem is an obsession with bureaucratic procedures that puts a
premium on civil servants finding fault and discourages innovation. 'I get
more credit if I pitch in with an objection,' complains one official.
The administration has found no way of rewarding performance and punishing
inefficiency. Mr P K Basu, a former permanent secretary, discovered that by
September 1989 cumulative delays on public sector projects in India had
reached a staggering total of 515 years. But no official had been punished.
Unlike France or Britain, where the best civil servants obtain rapid
promotion, India does not have a 'fast track'. An IAS officer cannot expect
to become a permanent secretary until he is 50 and he has to retire at 58.
Poor salaries have encouraged corruption. In the 1930s a senior member of
the ICS earned more than the chief justice of the US Supreme Court. But a
permanent secretary now gets about Rs10,000 (Dollars 500) a month  - and
retires on half the amount.
Many senior officials have remained conspicuously poor and honest. But the
service's reputation for corruption is such that the chance to make large
sums of money illegally is the motivating force behind many students who
seek to join the IAS from UP and Bihar.
One other cloud hangs over the future of the service. Whatever government
comes to power, popular pressure is such that the proportion of jobs
reserved for the poor and backward castes seems bound to increase - with the
consequent damage to efficiency that this type of protectionist measure
entails. Twenty two per cent of jobs in the central government are already
reserved for Harijans (untouchables).
Attempts at reform of the civil service have so far come to nought - and are
unlikely to succeed in the future without strong political leadership. The
gravity of India's political and economic difficulties has none the less
encouraged acceptance of new ideas. Prime Minister Chandra Shekar has talked
of the need for smaller states. Mr L K Advani, the leader of the Hindu
revivalist Bharatiya Janata party, has called for a presidential system. Mr
V P Singh's National Front is urging greater decentralisation.
But a big factor for change will be the pressure that the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and donor nations bring to bear on India to
carry through the structural changes needed to achieve a more competitive
industry and better export performance. As one Indian economist says: 'We
are past the stage of gradualist change.'

FT  01 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Making peace in southern Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a thread of mutual self-interest that links the complex
developments under way in southern Africa. The current Angolan peace
initiative is as critical to the welfare of the region as efforts to curb
political violence in South Africa.
If President FW de Klerk, Mr Nelson Mandela and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi
fail to end the bloodshed the implications for South Africa are bad enough.
It would also mean disaster for its neighbours, for whom trade ties with
Pretoria are vital.
At the same time, successful negotiations to end civil wars in Angola and
Mozambique will count for little if the region's military and industrial
giant is in its death throes. And if those negotiations should fail, South
Africa will be among the losers. President de Klerk's vision of
post-apartheid South Africa emerging from recession, acting as a regional
magnet for foreign investors, is dependent on stability in southern Africa
as a whole.
There are two ways in which the outside world can contribute to this
symbiotic peace process. South Africa can be assisted by the lifting of all
sanctions (except the arms embargo) and the restoration of sporting
contacts. Continuing economic decline can only fuel political tensions. But
at this stage at least, there is little further part for outsiders to play:
the country has the capacity, whether in the form of political leaders or
infrastructure, to preside over its transition to democracy.
Elusive peace
The same thing, however, cannot be said of the two other countries critical
to southern Africa's stability.
Mozambique's peace process is in jeopardy. The Renamo rebel movement is
motivated by banditry as much as ideology; the government, which has agreed
to a multi-party system and is ending state control of the economy, has
nowhere else to turn. And three decades of war have devastated the economy
and communications.
The need for outside help was acknowledged by government and rebels alike
when they accepted multinational monitoring of a partial ceasefire. But it
is increasingly clear that without further substantial international
involvement, peace in Mozambique will remain elusive.
Angola, with much greater economic potential, offers more hope. The rival
leaders, President Eduardo dos Santos, leader of the MPLA party, and Mr
Jonas Savimbi, head of the Unita guerrilla movement, are in control of their
respective organisations.
The settlement terms outlined this week by Mr Savimbi suggest that both men
have given ground in talks to end a 14-year war that has cost hundreds of
thousands of lives.
Outside involvement
But the level of outside involvement needed if the settlement is to succeed
is substantial, and it is not yet clear whether the United States, the
Soviet Union and the United Nations are prepared to provide the personnel
and resources for monitoring the cease-fire and multi-party elections on the
scale required.
No estimate appears to have been made. But one only has to recall that UN
monitoring of the Namibian settlement required a 7,500 strong force and cost
several hundred million dollars to realise that it will be expensive.
Namibia's population is a little more than a million, and its infrastructure
was intact. Angola has 10m people, and its infrastructure has been largely
destroyed.
Any call for assistance nevertheless deserves a generous response from the
international community, above all from the superpowers.
The long term solution to Africa's horrific famine requires an end to its
wars. Conflict in the Horn may seem intractable. But in southern Africa at
least, Mozambique and Angola have a framework for peace.
It was, after all, superpower rapprochement which helped undo southern
Africa's political logjam, bringing about Namibia's independence and ending
Pretoria's military support for Unita in return for Cuban troops leaving
Angola. The superpowers, backed by the broader international community, have
an important role to play.

Holidaymakers to Eire, beware. The rapid growth in heavy vehicle traffic and
the cuts in public spending have elevated the health of Ireland's road
system to the status of a national joke. Indeed, a popular radio chat show
has started a competition to find the republic's worst pothole.
Brendan McGahon, who represents a border constituency in the Irish
parliament, says: 'Anglers are fishing in them and wild animals we thought
were extinct are actually hiding in them.' A border guard recently warned
motorists approaching potholes to avoid other cars trying to get out of
them.

Who was the bright spark at Samuel Montagu, financial adviser to the Pounds
245m Mirror Group Newspapers float, who decided at the last minute to reduce
the size of the limited circulation pathfinder prospectus because it would
make the mailing easier?
Had it not been for Robert Maxwell's eagle eye for detail yesterday's final
version might not have emerged in its full tabloid-sized splendour.
Widespread expectations that the pathfinder version would be produced in
similar Mirror newspaper-style were dashed earlier this month when the
document returned from the printers in ordinary A4 dimensions.
It is said that Cap'n Bob was infuriated when he saw the change, chiefly
because it made the text, arranged in newspaper-like columns, extremely hard
to read. The order went out to print off extra copies in full tabloid size.
Yesterday's final version, with the MGN titles emblazoned across the cover,
was exactly as he wanted to see it.
So no one can accuse him of trying to conceal something nasty in the small
print.

The world's art and property markets may be suffering from indigestion at
the moment but Sotheby's, the ever-optimistic fine art auctioneers, still
thinks it can find someone to pay at least Pounds 55m for a house in Spain.
Admittedly, Barcelona's Casa Batllo is rather special. Designed by the
modernist Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi in 1904 for a wealthy textile
manufacturer, Josep Batllo, the eight-storey house is a national monument.
Its soft curving lines, ornate towers and rooms shaped like water-worn
caves, would make it an ideal home for an arts foundation or a trendy
retailer. Don't forget Barcelona is the site of the next Olympic games.
Iberia Seguros, the insurance company which owns the Gaudi extravaganza,
picked Sotheby's because it wanted someone who knows something about art.
Seguros' president Enrique Bernat, whose Chupa Chups is also the world's
biggest lollipop manufacturer, says the sale 'is like launching a balloon
into the air. It is impossible to put a price on a work of art like this and
we will see how high it will go.'
With that kind of sales pitch, one can see why there is no asking price. But
do I hear Pounds 70m, or 16bn yen?

Meanwhile, the Labour party's efforts on the City prawn cocktail circuit
seem to be paying handsome dividends judging by yesterday's outburst from
Fidelity's Barry Bateman.
In his first public outing as chairman of the Unit Trust Association,
Bateman savaged the government's wider share ownership policy, calling it as
misguided as the poll tax. 'But wider share ownership is not as big an issue
so it will be difficult to convince the government of the folly of their
ways. There are not many votes in it.'
Undoubtedly the unit trust industry has suffered because the instant profits
provided by successive privatisations have overshadowed the less spectacular
gains of steady long-term investments which suffer front-end charges.
Moreover the government has prevented unit trusts from exploiting the full
juicy potential of personal equity plans.
'If anything, the Labour party seems to know more about wider share
ownership and popular capitalism than the Tory party,' says Bateman.
However, even Bateman draws back from urging his members to put their money
where their mouth is and make a contribution to the Labour party.

<TEXT>
If Lords Hanson, King and Sterling can do it, why can a Labour peer not hold
down a full-time job running a publicly quoted company besides moonlighting
in the House of Lords?
The question arises because Clive Hollick - chief executive of MAI, one of
Britain's last surviving financial conglomerates - has just been made a
working Labour peer. Given that MAI has big plans to add a TV franchise to
its rag-bag of money broking and outdoor poster interests, there is a danger
that young Clive, who has another 20 years to go before he collects his old
age pension, might be spreading himself a bit thin. The City has always been
suspicious of socialist chief executives with beards.
Hollick is unrepentant. Having salvaged the group from the 1970s secondary
banking crisis, he has come through the recession with a strong balance
sheet and gently rising profits. He avoided the pitfalls that snared such
bigger groups as Mercantile House and British &amp; Commonwealth, and is kept in
check by a reasonably strong board of non-executive directors led by the
rather elderly Sir Ian Morrow.
Having turned down the idea of buying the New Statesman, Hollick has made
his main political contribution as a driving force behind the Institute for
Public Policy Research. Set up as a rival to Tory think-tanks, it quickly
overcame initial scepticism and is now regarded as having greatly enhanced
Labour's more pragmatic approach.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Leading Article: And Ridley begat Lilley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRMINGHAM business lead-ers yesterday witnessed Mr Peter Lilley, the trade
and industry secretary, conduct the political equivalent of a humane
killing. He politely did away with the idea from Mr Nicholas Ridley, his
predecessor, that the Department of Trade and Industry should revert to
doing little more than the pre-war Board of Trade.
Mr Lilley's welcome clarification that the DTI does have a role is more
evidence that words such as sensible and practical rank alongside conviction
and principle in this government's vocabulary. Mr Lilley's aim in recasting
his department's role was as much political as industrial: to rebuild
bridges with industry battered by his predecessors and the recession and to
respond to Labour's industrial policy programme.
He castigated the interventionist industrial policies of the 1960s and
1970s, but acknowledged that despite their failure government has to go
beyond the confines of Ridleyism. Mr Lilley's methodical style contrasts
markedly with the marketing glitz of Lord Young which industrialists so
distrusted.
Yet he did not concede any ground to the Labour party. It is now easier to
identify where Labour and the Conservatives differ on issues of principle
and where on questions of implementation.
Rhetorical agreement
There is at least rhetorical agreement on the importance of a strong
manufacturing base, an effective training system, policies to promote
innovation and partnership between government and industry. There are,
however, significant differences about how these policies should be
delivered.
The two parties part company on other fundamental issues. Labour proposes a
panoply of tax breaks to encourage research and development. It would create
a plethora of quangos to deliver its policies. Mr Lilley rightly puts
competition at the centre of an industrial policy to promote innovation. His
reforms will thankfully simplify rather than multiply the government bodies
industry has to deal with.
In other words, Mr Lilley is steering in the right direction. But as he
acknowledged, there is more to be done. Forthcoming speeches on competition
policy, regulation and innovation should put more flesh on yesterday's
skeletal policy framework. Policy towards innovation should be the clearest
test of the effectiveness of the new approach.
Innovation policy
In the last decade, government policy on innovation - which ranged from the
ambitious Alvey programme of research into information technology, to the
encouragement of collaborative research between small companies - did
nothing to reverse Britain's relative decline in the innovation stakes. This
is a stark contrast with the record on manufacturing productivity, which
rose dramatically as managers used the framework of government economic
policy and trade union legislation to push through long-overdue changes to
working practices. One of the chief tasks for the DTI this decade should be
to follow up the productivity improvements with similarly effective policies
to promote innovation. British companies are much more efficient at making
products. They now need to become better at developing new ones.
There are limits to the government's proper role. Innovation mainly depends
upon the ability of managers to exploit technology commercially.
But Mr Lilley can go further than his Birmingham agenda of streamlined DTI
schemes and an R&amp;D scoreboard of the most innovative British companies. The
debate over short-termism has produced plenty of ideas, from better R&amp;D
disclosure to improved links between higher education establishments and
industry. Mr Lilley should put the DTI at the heart of this evolving debate.
Meanwhile within Whitehall, welcome recent understandings between the
employment and education departments point to further potential gains from
interdepartmental efforts. It would help, for example, if the Advisory
Council on Science and Technology, which is responsible to the Cabinet
Office, were replaced by a more effective body.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Brazilian percussionist describes his music as 'organic' and most of the
instruments on the platform certainly seem to be derived from animal or
vegetable matter. There are multifarious objets - shells, shakers,
earthenware pots and various sticks to beat them with. Playing to a full
house on Monday Vasconcelos shuffled on, grinning broadly, scratching at the
berimbau. Hemmed in by this curious paraphernalia he looks like a very happy
market trader.
The berimbau, a long bow with a gourd for a soundbox, is his main instrument
and he makes the most of its component parts and its abrasive whispering
quality. But, following the growling and chanting of 'Let's all go to the
jungle', where the percussionist seems to have raided the BBC sound-effects
cupboard, Vasconcelos' berimbau was upstaged (visually at least) by the
arrival of Tunde Jegede and his koras.
The 19-year-old Londoner's chosen instrument is a gourd topped by a four
foot mast onto which two grab handles are attached. It is plucked, placed
phallically on the knees, with the thumbs and forefingers. In Jegede's
hands, rhythm and melody played simultaneously in 'The cycle of reckoning',
it sounds deliciously like harpsichord and classical guitar in one.
The second half, Vasconcelos flouncing on with talking drum tucked under one
arm, brought the inevitable - the dreaded audience participation. Divided
into 'this half' and 'that half' for a trip down the Amazon we were directed
to imitate the river and the rain. In my experience an audience divides into
those that quiver at the thought of 'joining in' and those who relish direct
involvement with a zeal which overwhelms their ability.
It was with some relief therefore when the squeaking from the wings turned
out to be Vasconcelos' old sparring partner, saxophonist Andy Sheppard,
bringing us back to the more familiar sound of the tenor and a bout of
circular breathing on soprano.
Relaxing as this casual coming and going was, we really needed more
percussion from the north-east of Brazil and the master himself. Eventually
Vasconcelos did take to his shakers, earthenware pot and cowbells with more
conviction: but too briefly and we were soon entreated to join in again.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A mostly Mozart programme brought to a close the 10th birthday series of
concerts given by the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, sponsored by The BOC
Group. That attendences have been so good throughout is hopefully due in no
little measure to the presence of a healthy number of FT readers, attracted
by a special ticket promotion.
After ten years it is possible to take stock. Although the COE players still
only come together for five or six months a year, their playing never lets
on. This is one of the finest chamber orchestras of today, less sumptuous
perhaps in tone than the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, but more
flexible than the conductorless Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, among its
immediate rivals. And that second comparison points to the COE's special
character.
For this young orchestra has built close relationships with some of the
world's leading conductors: Abbado, Solti, Harnoncourt (unforgettably at
this same hall two weeks ago). And, for this concert, the eminent Mozartian,
Sandor Vegh. Of all of them, he trusts most to the musicians' instincts and
does no more than necessary, though there were a few moments on Monday when
the players looked as though they would have liked a clear lead and did not
get it.
Vegh came to conducting with fine credentials as a player of chamber music
and it was that spirit of give-and-take, of music being made on an intimate
scale, that gave this evening its own flavour. The opening of Mozart's
Symphony No 29 suggested indeed that the conductor might be about to cosset
the music all too lovingly. But the performance had just enough spirit and
Vegh is always specific, not generalised, in what he wants to say.
A group of five Mozart Contredanses and Wolf's Italian Serenade, genially
smiling, opened to view intimate corners of expression. The best, though,
was Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante, K. 297b, in which four wind soloists from
the orchestra (especially the clarinet, Richard Hosford) distinguished
themselves in the solo parts.
It is that strength of solo performers that has given the COE its enviable
reputation in only a decade.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Arts: Edward II - The Pit, Barbican
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you want to see a play wrecked by a wrong choice of costume, go to the
Royal Shakespeare Company's Edward II, which has arrived at The Pit from
Stratford. To be fair to the designers, there are a lot more faults in this
production than the wardrobe, but the clothes do set a tone. If you dress
the characters in black and white leather jackets, trousers to go with them,
and heaven knows what the Queen is wearing, you are at a disadvantage from
the start.
For a number of reasons, the production never quite recovers from this
self-inflicted wound. Simon Russell Beale is an actor of great versatility;
he is not, however, one of nature's Edward IIs. The point about the part is
that he has a strong homosexual attraction to his favourites. He is also the
King of England with wars to fight, civil and foreign. To carry this off, in
the court and on the stage, requires a certain style. Beale plays the role
as someone short, fat and stupid who hops about like a bloated frog.
The message may be that you do not have to be beautiful to have homosexual
passions. Yet it would help if there were a certain style. Beale is simply
gross. He never rises to the part. Moreover, he shouts - repeatedly and
unnecessarily. So do much of the rest of the cast. This is not a production
of light and shade.
Edward II, admittedly, is not Christopher Marlowe's best play: not a patch
on Tamburlaine the Great or Dr Faustus. But it does have its moments as well
as unmistakeable affinities with Shakespeare's Richard II. Its greatest
attraction is Piers Gaveston, the King's first favourite. The RSC's
Gaveston, played by Grant Thatcher, comes into his own only when he has been
beaten up and his mouth is covered in blood - like lipstick. By then, he has
little left to say. Before that, he is dressed in his ridiculous white
leather clothes with sequins. The only surprise is that he does not wear an
earring. That is left to the King's next favourite, Spencer, whom we first
see under a sheet with a curate.
The nobles and the clerics are wooden. This may be deliberate. For if the
King does not behave like a king, even a deviant king, the court can hardly
be expected to behave like a court. The general entourage is more like that
of a rotary club faced with unseemly goings on, which cannot have been what
Marlowe intended. There ought also to be room for some humour, since most of
the characters go through a remarkable number of changes of mind. That is
not there either.
The best performance is by Ciaran Hands as the young Mortimer. By the time
he has become an accomplice to murder, his black jacket is decked with
phosphorescent green. For the rest, it is a pretty grim evening. The
direction is by Gerard Murphy.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Arts: All for Love - Almeida Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first and - if you want a really short review - only thing to be said
about All for Love is: see it] If you have neither read nor seen the play
before, you will wonder why you remained in such ignorance for so long. If
already acquainted with it, you may still be surprised by the passion that
can be put into it. Either way, you are in for a treat. Diana Rigg goes with
it.
All for Love is John Dryden's version of Antony and Cleopatra. It is not
invidious to make comparisons. Since Dryden was the foremost literary critic
of his age, and no mean poet and dramatist, he knew exactly what he was
doing. He invited the comparison himself. All for Love is not better than
Shakespeare's play; it is just totally different, though in one area I think
that it achieves something that Shakespeare never attempted - that is, frank
talking by a woman about her lovers.
Ms Rigg is not an especially queenly Cleopatra in the sense of wearing robes
and crowns, at least till the end. She plays the part by exuding passion and
not being embarrassed to admit it. True, she went first with Caesar, but
Caesar possessed her person, not her love. She knows the difference between
a wife and a mistress. There are two scenes that could never have appeared
in Shakespeare: one where she explains her feelings to Antony, the other
where she meets his wife (and Caesar's sister) Octavia. This is a kind of
modern psychological drama. Octavia, played by Angela Down emerges as a real
part.
Beside the women, James Laurenson's Antony is a curiously subdued figure.
That is the only query I have about the production. To be sure, he is pretty
down, having lost his empire and his mistress, and continues to be torn
between his love for Cleopatra and his duty to Octavia. But if you make
Antony such a dead-beat, it makes one wonder why people had such regard for
him in the first place.
The admiration for Antony extends to his general, Ventidius. For Dryden did
not write a play simply about the main characters. The lines that go with
Ventidius's suicide scene are among the best quiet dramatic verse that has
been written. Bernard Horsfall, having been slightly unconvincing at the
start, cannot fail to rise to them.
Equally, Dryden fills out the characters around Cleopatra: Charmion and the
Eunuch. Charmion, played by Pauline Jameson, is a rather elderly figure;
Alexas the Eunuch (Alan MacNaughtan) even older. Between them, they seem to
make up the queen's sole court and thus emphasise her loneliness when she is
apart from Antony.
It occurred to me that Jonathan Kent's production could be filmed as it is.
It is pure drama. So much for All for Love being an obscure, academics' play
that seldom needs to be performed. It should now takes its place in the
forefront of English theatre, which is where Dryden thought it belonged.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Arts: Manon Lescaut - Bastille, Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The amount of opera available in Paris this season is astonishing. In terms
of quantity, at least, the city is currently the world's most varied
operatic emporium. Rarities and novelties of all kinds find outlets at the
Chatelet, pro the Champs-Elysees and the Opera-Comique. At the new Bastille
theatre, in its first full season, a groundplan of repertory works is being
fulfilled. After Otello, Figaro, Berio's Un re in ascolto, and Queen of
Spades comes the Puccini Manon Lescaut; Samson et Dalila, Flute and Katya
Kabanova follow shortly. The list is an intelligent piece of
bread-and-butter planning; the early Puccini opera, a copious lyrical
outpouring of youthful passions, is just the sort of work to set a large
theatre Italianately ringing the way opera audiences love it to do.
At a Manon Lescaut performance in the middle of the run, a uniquely
depressing and alarming experience, that seemed the foremost problem: the
theatre doesn't allow ringing. The acoustics have been the source of
controversy since it was opened, but there can surely be no disagreement
over the wrong-end-of-the-telescope reductive impact they are forcing on
Puccini's vocal lines. Placed anywhere but at the very front of that
incommodiously broad, deep stage, the singers are audible  - but as if their
voices were coming in on the breeze from the next quartier.
As in this unevenly shaped, narratively zigzagging opera it is in the vocal
outbursts, solo or duet, that dramatic impetus is most strongly sustained,
it is impossible to exaggerate the cumulatively disastrous effect of the
acoustics on the voices and on the opera. Puccini distanced, Puccini
prevented from hitting a listener smack in the solar plexus, is Puccini
denatured; the orchestral sound is clear, if not exactly ripe in bloom, but
from pit and stage no sort of musical blend or even balance seems possible.
As if in covert admission of all the theatre's self-generated handicaps, the
production by Robert Carsen seeks to plump out the stage with huge, glitzy
spectacle. The stage is at almost all times chock-full of supers - Mardi
Gras revellers wearing gaudy capes and carrying huge umbrellas, perruqued
and white-powdered courtiers at the stage margins, Act 2 servants in endless
formations. The designs (by Anthony Ward) suggest touches of theatrical
avant-garderie (with mirrors, huge falling drapes, skewed walls) without
making the audience nervous; the tricks of novelty in the staging do
likewise.
It's the latest form of what Brecht deemed 'culinary' entertainment. Since
the production bears surtitles in French and English, and is shared with
Antwerp, it's also, I would say, International Opera in its most worrying
incarnation: opera that looks good, means nothing, can be taken from house
to house, and is capable of supporting a procession of unrehearsed singers
without much damage. For the Manon Lescaut run the house had planned
alternate casts, but on this occasion there were substitutes - unexplained -
for those alternates: the conductor Nello Santi was replaced by Maurizio
Barbacini, the tenor Vasile Moldoveanu by Antonio Ordonez.
In the circumstances, it was something of a miracle that things held
together as well as they did (Mr Barbacini is obviously a conductor worth
trying out in better-ordered conditions); one saluted the professionalism of
Patrick Raftery (Lescaut), and the trenchant delivery of Ian Caley (Edmondo)
and Jules Bastin (Geronte): no holding their voices back] I had been looking
forward to a first hearing of Ordonez, a Spanish tenor who burst on the
European scene a few years ago; the timbre is plangently appealing, but the
loud high phrases are all in overdrive, and on this occasion he simply ran
out of them in Act 3.
The heroine was Barbara Daniels. She is what the Italians call a vero
artista: a performer who communicates warmth and engagement, a sense of the
words, a feeling for the musical style. In these disconnected circumstances
her Manon came across in eye- and ear-catching bursts, not all of a piece;
but at least she came across. It is time for those in charge at the Bastille
to stop pussyfooting about. The scale of the acoustical problems is immense,
and no earthly purpose is served by the continuing denial of their
existence.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Management: Bata takes a step back to its roots -
Paternalism in flux / Bernard Simon talks to the chairman/founder of the
world's largest shoe manufacturer about its trading policies with its former
oppressors in Czechoslovakia and its hopes for consolidating its toehold in
the Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thomas Bata professes to be opposed to boycotts and sanctions. The company
that bears his name made shoes in Rhodesia under Ian Smith, in Uganda under
Idi Amin, and in Chile under Augusto Pinochet. It withdrew from South Africa
with the greatest reluctance.
But when it comes to dealing with Communists, the forceful chairman of the
world's biggest shoe manufacturer has different ideas. He decided against
buying a Toshiba portable computer because, he says, the Japanese company
sold submarine propellers to the Soviet Union. More significantly, Bata
avoided doing business with his native Czechoslovakia for more than 30 years
after the Communist government took over the family's factories and shops in
the late 1940s.
Now that the Communists are no longer in power in Czechoslovakia and those
in the Soviet Union need all the help they can get, the energetic
76-year-old chairman of Bata Shoe Organisation has good reason to soften his
approach.
'In North America and western Europe, shoes are coming out of people's
ears,' says Bata, whose company sells more than 300m pairs a year, some 60
per cent of them made in its own factories. 'There is only one part of the
world where there is a vacuum for footwear, and that is the Soviet Union.'
In the case of Czechoslovakia, the tug is more sentimental. 'We were not
willing to do business with the Communists because they treated some of our
people in a most disgusting and inhumane manner,' he says. Now, however, 'we
are anxious and willing to do something for the place where we have roots.'
Although Bata denies it, events in eastern Europe have brought another big
change in the family business. Despite Bata's huge presence in footwear, the
public knows little about its far-flung operations.
The family, operating the company privately, still declines to disclose
details of revenues, profits or market share. But it has recently become
much more open in discussing its business interests, especially those in
Czechoslovakia.
Bata owns 40 factories and 6,300 shoe shops in 69 countries, and has 70,000
employees. It has the franchise for Nike sneakers in Chile and for Adidas
shoes in India. It also operates tanneries in 14 countries and a number of
rubber-processing plants.
'The strength of our organisation is survival,' says Tom's soft-spoken but
steely wife Sonja who, as a director of the company, has an office next to
his at the company's modest headquarters in suburban Toronto. Bata's
business in Uganda was twice taken over by the government and twice control
was handed back to Bata. The company was forced to buy a vegetable-exporting
farm in Zambia to provide foreign exchange for imported chemicals for its
shoe factory.
A cornerstone of Bata's strategy has been to locate its factories as far
away as possible from big urban centres, thus holding down wage costs and
discouraging trade union organisers. Its main North American manufacturing
complex, in the company town of Batawa, named after the shoe company and
started in 1939, is located in a rural area between Toronto and Ottawa.
Tom Bata, who is still driven home for lunch most days with his wife when he
is in Toronto, acknowledges that the company's management style, at least
until recently, may best be described as paternalistic.
But he insists that the schools and other amenities provided by the company
were 'not done for the sake of paternalism.' It has a high proportion of
illiterate people and women in its workforce, especially in the Third World,
and Bata says it 'was all done for the sake of making people's work and
their lives easier'.
That management style and much else about Bata is now in flux. Although he
remains an active chairman of the Bata Shoe Organisation, Tom Bata handed
over the chief executive's job six years ago to his son, Thomas Jr. While
father started his working life as an apprentice in a shoe factory in Zlin,
the son is a graduate of Harvard Business School.
With his less forceful son at the helm, the company's senior management is
expected to have greater scope to tackle the business challenges of the
1990s. As a company, Bata is having to adjust to the realities of
increasingly stiff competition from countries where it has little or no
presence, notably China and Taiwan, and to a workforce more mobile (and thus
less loyal) than it used to be.
'Today, our focus is on developing products ourselves and very often having
other people make them for us,' Bata says. In the Third World, that has
meant helping entrepreneurs set up small businesses to supply uppers and
other shoe parts to Bata assembly plants. The company sent a Zambian
manufacturer of tea kettles to Germany to learn how to make the high-quality
steel toecaps needed for mining boots.
In Europe and North America, the focus has shifted to retailing and
specialised high-margin manufacturing. Many of the shoes Bata now sells are
made by other manufacturers, especially in the Far East. Bata has no
factories in the US, but owns 800 shops there. It operates four retail
chains in France, each catering to a different segment of the market.
But it is on eastern Europe that Tom Bata is focusing much of his energy. He
is most expansive when the conversation turns to Czechoslovakia. Although he
left Czechoslovakia in 1932, his emotional attachment to his homeland has
clearly never flickered.
Ten generations of Batas had made shoes in Czechoslovakia before Tom
transferred the family business to Canada in the 1930s ahead of the Nazi
occupation. He left behind one of the country's biggest industrial
conglomerates which, besides its shoe factories and shops, included hosiery,
tyre and synthetic fibre businesses, and even a small aircraft manufacturer.
Before the overthrow of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia in 1989, Tom
Bata broadcast regularly to his former countrymen over Radio Free Europe and
the Voice of America. And when he returned to a hero's welcome in December
1989, his Learjet carried 10 fax machines ordered by Civic Forum.
Bata says he is eager to help put the family's businesses, nationalised in
the late 1940s by the Czech communist government, back on their feet. In the
past year, some 15 Bata executives from other parts of the world have
travelled to Czechoslovakia to provide technical and managerial help. The
company has enrolled 150 of its Czechoslovak employees in basic business
courses, and brought several others to its own corporate seminars in western
Europe. He has lifted his self-imposed boycott and has started buying shoes
from his former factories in Czechoslovakia again.
But some sour notes have crept into the relationship between Prague and its
best-known expatriate. Although the communists never paid any compensation
for the assets they seized, the new government has so far been reluctant to
return the factories and shops to Bata.
The present Czech government is apparently concerned at the Canadian
company's economic muscle, and has up to now insisted that Bata must bid for
its former assets like any other interested investor. While the company is
still hoping that Prague will soften its line, Bata, for his part, says the
businesses have deteriorated more under a centrally-planned economy than he
suspected a year ago.
'The managers had done a marvellous job in keeping the factories going under
the most difficult circumstances,' he says. 'But I could recognise many
parts of the plant as being exactly as I had left them, except that they
were 50 years older. The production planning forms were exactly the same as
they had been 50 years ago, except that in my day there would be one piece
of paper. This time I counted seven pieces.
'The products were very pedestrian, much more like the products we would
normally make in Africa or in our simpler Far East operations. They were
mainly aimed at the Soviet market, where a shoe factory has to guarantee
that a Russian can stand in melting snow for two hours without his feet
getting wet. That is a requirement for the Soviet Union; it is not the type
of requirement which the Czechs or Slovaks would normally want.'
The dilemma for Bata as it seeks to expand its involvement in eastern Europe
again is that the Czech factories will continue for the foreseeable future
to depend heavily on eastbound exports. 'There are some parts of the
business which are not going to survive, particularly if the Soviet market
is lost,' Bata predicts.
He is trying to consolidate his toehold in the Soviet Union, although he is
under no illusions about the problems involved. Bata has started selling
shoes to the Soviets from a factory in India. Using the same skills it has
mastered in parts of Africa, it is also examining the feasibility of helping
the Soviets lengthen the shelf life of the hides of animals slaughtered at
remote abattoirs by siting tanneries close to the abattoirs.
Despite the difficulties, Tom Bata is relaxed about long-term prospects for
the shoe business in eastern Europe and elsewhere. 'From the point of view
of the world economy, we're not that worried,' he says. 'People are not
going to give up shoes the way they've given up hats.'

The first phase of the AEU union's shorter-hours campaign ended officially
earlier this month but the union said a further 12 companies might face
strikes. Threatened plants include Hotpoint in Peterborough and NEI Victor

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Nalgo rejects change in work at
British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS OF white-collar workers at British Gas have rejected a package which
would allow the organisation to offer a fuller service to customers outside
normal office hours.
If accepted by the unions, the management's proposed deal would have led to
considerable changes in working practices in exchange for better pay and
improved benefits.
However, leaders of Nalgo, the public service union, have rejected the
proposals on the grounds that the financial incentives were not enough.
British Gas was offering to raise basic salaries, ranging from Pounds 7,500
to Pounds 22,000, by 3.25 per cent from next March, and offering a one-off
payment of Pounds 450 on September 1.
If the plan had been accepted by the unions, customers would have been able
to contact white-collar workers, including those who arrange schedules of
meter readers and industrial workers, and those who prepare bills, between
8am and 7.30pm on weekdays and between 8am and 6pm on Saturdays.
At present British Gas white-collar staff work normal office hours. As part
of the deal, the management wanted to make their hours more flexible. It
would have asked employees to work four-day weeks, of longer hours, and
nine-day fortnights.
British Gas also wanted to reorganise the 11 existing grades into six.
In return for the changes, the company was offering an improved career
structure for staff and help with childcare.
Nalgo's gas section leaders say most of the package was 'well balanced' but
argue that the payment being offered is insufficient to compensate for the
changes that workers are being asked to accept.

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Rolls-Royce workers lose their daily
bottle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THATCHER the milk snatcher' did it to school-children 20 years ago. Now a
group of Rolls-Royce foundry workers have also lost their daily bottle of
milk.
Since before the Second World War the company has been providing a daily
pint of milk to each member of a group of workers at its Derby plant's light
alloy foundry.
As with schoolchildren before Mrs Margaret Thatcher's decision as education
secretary to end the era of free school milk for those over seven, it was
for the good of their health.
Rolls-Royce started the practice because it was thought milk would alleviate
the effects of toxic fumes given off by molten metal.
Twenty years ago Rolls-Royce's medical advisers decided that this was not
the case but the company carried on the tradition anyway.
Now, however, the free milk has become a victim of the latest round of cost
cuts at a company coping with the effects of a worldwide recession in the
aerospace industry.
The end of the milk round for about 25 workers at the foundry, employing
300, was condemned yesterday by the AEU engineering union.
Mr Ken Smith, AEU divisional organiser, said it was a penny-pinching move.
He said conditions in the foundry were much better because of improved dust
extraction facilities. But the company's decision saved it very little money
and was 'too petty for words'.
Rolls-Royce said there was no medical benefit to the workers in drinking
milk as had once been thought. The move was part of a series of measures to
improve the company's efficiency.
Earlier this year the company announced that it was cutting between 1,200
and 1,500 jobs at its Derby commercial aerospace operations because of the
recession.
Union leaders fear there will not be enough volunteers for redundancies and
that the company will try to introduce compulsory redundancies.

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Unions call for first Tube strike on
May 9
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS at London Under-ground called yesterday for a one-day strike a week
tomorrow. The strike call came even though they had agreed earlier to talks
tomorrow at Acas, the conciliation service, aimed at settling a dispute over
job losses.
The strike would be the first in a series unless a settlement is reached. Mr
Richard Rosser, general secretary of the TSSA white collar union, said he
was hopeful for a solution but 'people will have to shift their positions,
not least London Underground'.
Although London Underground has also agreed to tomorrow's Acas talks it said
yesterday that the size of the workforce was an issue for management.
The dispute is over London Underground's plan to shed more than 1,000 jobs,
reducing the total to 21,500. Management has refused union requests for
arbitration through internal railway negotiating machinery.
London Underground said it was prepared to go to Acas to explore whether
there was any common ground between the two sides.
Acas will talk to the unions and management separately; there are no plans
for the two sides to meet.
The call for a stoppage next Thursday follows a ballot of both the TSSA and
RMT unions in which members voted 2-1 in favour of strike action.
Mr Rosser said it was necessary to order action soon because his union's
legal mandate would run out on May 17. Unions are required by the law to
start action within 28 days of the end of a ballot. The RMT and TSSA want to
co-ordinate their action.
The RMT said: 'We hope the talks will not be a cosmetic meeting.'

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Usdaw votes for and against pay
restraint policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSY among unions over pay policy under a Labour government was
re-kindled yesterday when the Usdaw shopworkers' union voted both for and
against rejecting any form of wage restraint.
The contradictory votes at the annual conference in Blackpool came after
Usdaw's leaders called for delegates not to rule out wage restraint under
Labour because pay would have to be discussed as part of a national economic
assessment.
Mr Syd Tierney, Usdaw president, said after the votes that he expected the
union's national executive to accept the possibility of wage restraint under
Labour. This would make Usdaw the first union explicitly not to rule out a
form of incomes policy.
The conference voted by 114,723 to 104,887 to reject opposition to 'any wage
restraint policy under this or any future government'. However, it then
voted by 112,005 to 103,821 to 'accept no wage restriction under any
government'.
Mr Tierney said: 'We are in lumber, facing ourselves coming backwards. It is
the worst possible situation we can be in.' He said the executive would take
into account the fact that more delegates voted against opposition to wage
restraint. Usdaw was among the only unions at the Scottish Trades Union
Congress last month to vote against the call to rule out wage restraint.
Mr Garfield Davies, Usdaw general secretary, said that it would be
unrealistic to exclude discussion of wage levels from an economic
assessment. He said that a national minimum wage which helped Usdaw members
would be a form of incomes policy.
Mr Davies said that blanket opposition to wage restraint before a Labour
government came to power could become a millstone around the neck of unions.
He said unions should leave their options open until after an election.
The votes came after controversy over Labour's support for an economic
assessment under which the government, employers and unions would discuss
the economy and its implications for taxation, training and wages each year.
Opposition to the idea in the TUC has been led by the AEU engineering union.
The votes at Usdaw are among the first in a series on wage policy at union
conferences.

democracy - Voters go to the polls against a backdrop of greater
centralisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MALCOLM BRADBURY's 'History Man' in his eponymous 1970s novel was an
unattractive, radical academic, spouting Trotsky, acting like Stalin and
voting with Labour's hard left.
Mr Simon Sedgwick-Jell, a real-life history lecturer and Labour leader of
Cambridge city council, is an altogether different political animal and
exemplary evidence of the party's new-found maturity.
A proponent of 'radical realism', he says Labour has successfully sold its
progressive policies only by serving its consumers high quality services
under a strict financial regime. The outcome has been 11 years of Labour
control in a seat that regularly returns a Tory MP.
In this respect at least, the Cambridge leader's message is a model of
modern Labourism. In others, though, he is arguably at odds with a party
leadership that, while advocating devolved power, is regarded by many of its
supporters as almost as didactically centralist as its Tory opponents.
For the unspoken subtext behind tomorrow's local government elections is
deep concern among all parties' local politicians at the systematic loss of
power to Westminster.
Like his Liberal Democrat opponents and, indeed, some Tories, Mr
Sedgwick-Jell passionately supports local proportional representation, wants
more powers for local government and disparages much of the party posturing
dominating this week's elections.
'There is a needless level of confrontation in local government,' he says.
'Eleven months of the year we have a constructive debate, then in April
everyone goes bonkers - it is unhealthy.'
A whistlestop tour of six council elections confirms that this viewpoint is
commonplace among local politicians.
With more than 12,000 metropolitan, city and shire district council seats
being contested, canvassers are having their ears burnt on the doorsteps
about the sterility of party political rhetoric and the need for more action
at local level.
Excuses that the poll tax, capping and other restraints on local
authorities' freedom of manoeuvre all come from Westminster only deepen
public cynicism, already fuelled by recession and high mortgage rates.
Moreover, a random sample of opinion taken from Nottingham, Milton Keynes,
Bath, Plymouth, Cumbria and Cambridge revealed that a generally grumpy
electorate is prone to those most dangerous of moods - both apathy and
volatility.
All this is rebounding on local politicians as a whole. Undoubtedly, the
chief beneficiary of the poll tax saga must, as last year, be Labour,
fighting in many areas from its low electoral base of 1987.
While a few hung councils like Nottingham will be captured, party officials
agree that the real measure of Labour's success rest on its progress in the
Tory dominated south. A decline in the Liberal Democrat vote should be
offset by gains in specially targetted areas.
Looking beyond the national issues of poll tax reform and the economy,
however, local politicians are now far more preoccupied with the 'softness'
of their votes, a consequence, they assume, of their perceived
powerlessness.
The changes presented in Mr Norman Lamont's budget last month mean that
councils' self-financed expenditure will now drop by Pounds 5.6bn to Pounds
9.1bn in 1991-92 at a time when government support has risen by Pounds 10bn
to Pounds 52.5bn. Elsewhere, even some Tories are now expressing private
disquiet at the creeping intrusion of Whitehall through such measures as
opt-out schemes for schools.
Parties may dispute the details of resource allocation, planning decisions
or of housing schemes, but they are wholly united in their wishes for more
local economic development, increased resources, planning autonomy and more
housing.
Tory Warwickshire is as spitting furious with the Department of the
Environment's spending restraints as is Labour-controlled Milton Keynes.
In both Plymouth and Penrith, politicians talk openly of getting a more
sympathetic hearing in Brussels than in Westminster.
Plymouth, with all-party agreement, is now an enthusiastic participant in
Atlantic Arc, a political link up with other 'remote' coastal regions such
as San Sebastian in Spain and Roscoff in Brittany.
In Penrith, Mrs Joan Robinson, a Liberal Democrat councillor at both
district and Cumbria county level, complained that perceptions of local
government are based on an erroneous 'south-east' view that councils are
necessarily spendthrift and, if Labour-led, inevitably 'loony' too.
This hostility to London is by no means new, but it is mounting. Moreover,
it now has a catalyst in the forthcoming debate over the reorganisation of
boundaries.
Most local politicians and chief executives agree that unitary authorities
are the right way of governing local affairs.
Achieving the critical mass needed to get real economies of scale, however,
will reopen a debate about powers and resources almost certainly well beyond
party control.
How, they ask, can the voguish concept of 'citizen power' be reconciled with
ever-diminishing local autonomy?
On Friday, psephologists will pour over the election results for clues as to
national trends for the general election to come. Local government analysts,
however, will look at the turnout - down to 45 per cent in the last
comparable vote in 1987 - fearing more evidence of voter alienation.
'People are perplexed by the condition of local government, of appalling
traffic and poor transport,' says Mr Andrew Duff, former leader of
Cambridge's Liberal Democrats. 'They are extremely cynical and sceptical
about the claims of all politicians to build homes and improve education.
'The first party that can back out of this ghetto will reap the whirlwind.'
Mr Sedgwick-Jell, his longtime opponent, would be the first to agree.

Devolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, has underlined his continuing
opposition to any form of Scottish assembly, which he says would undermine
the stability of the United Kingdom and bring no benefits to Scotland.
His comments, in an interview with the Financial Times, came amid continuing
speculation that the Scottish Conservatives are planning a big U-turn on the
issue of devolution, which was overwhelmingly rejected at the party's
Scottish conference in 1988 but commands majority support in the Scottish
opinion polls.
A number of prominent Scottish Conservatives have recently proposed various
forms of Scottish assembly.
Mr Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist
Association, has indicated that the party is prepared to listen to arguments
on the subject, although it is not down for debate at next month's party
conference.
'I have not the slightest doubt that there would be a serious crisis of
confidence leading to reduced investment and employment and the undermining
of our manufacturing base if we moved along the devolutionary path,' Mr Lang
said. The effects would be the same whether or not the assembly had
tax-raising powers, though without tax-raising powers would take longer to
become apparent.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Lords set to be overruled - War
Crimes Bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE first time under a Conservative administration, procedures allowing
the House of Commons to overrule the Lords went into operation in a
confrontation between peers and the government over war crimes.
After a nine-hour debate yesterday, a cross-party alliance of peers defied
the Commons by 131 votes to 109 to reject for a second time legislation
which would enable British citizens who are alleged war criminals to be
tried in UK courts for atrocities committed during the Second World War.
They also condemned the use of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, which
enable a bill passed by the Commons to become law even if the Lords has
rejected it in two successive sessions, on an issue where MPs and peers have
been allowed to vote according to their consciences.
The Lords defeated the same bill last June, by 207 votes to 74, a much
greater margin. MPs have twice approved it by substantial majorities.
The defeat for the bill came despite a last-minute concession by Lord
Waddington, the leader of the Lords. He said that the government would look
sympathetically at amendments suggested by Lord Bridge of Harwich, supported
by other law lords, to increase the prospects of a fair trial.
He also reminded peers that the bill followed an inquiry by two
distinguished prosecutors who had concluded that there were a handful of
cases where there was enough evidence to support a criminal prosecution.
Senior peers from all parties, including former Tory and Labour cabinet
ministers, argued, however, in a series of powerful speeches that the bill
was so fundamentally flawed that even if it were changed, a fair trial would
be impossible and any defendant would face insuperable difficulties in
preparing his case.
Lord Shawcross, a former attorney-general and prosecutor at the Nuremberg
trials, said: 'It is our clear duty and constitutional right to express our
independent views and vote according to conscience.'
Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, the Liberal Democrat leader in the Lords, said
that the use of the Parliament Acts procedures would be a 'constitutional
monstrosity'.
The restrictions on the powers of the Lords were used twice by the Liberal
government in 1914, and once by the Labour government in 1949.
In theory, the government could still prevent the bill becoming law, but it
has made a clear commitment to legislate.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Mellor believes recovery is near -
Finance Bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER claim that Britain was emerging from the economic recession was
made by Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, in the Commons
last night.
He interpreted findings of a CBI survey published earlier in the day as a
clear signal of a 'recovery of confidence'.
Mr Mellor accused Labour MPs of 'talking the economy down' when they cast
doubt on the assertion by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in Washington on
Monday that recovery was 'round the corner'.
MPs gave a second reading to the Finance Bill - giving effect to the March
Budget - by a majority of 101 (310-209).
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's shadow chief secretary, acknowledged that the
CBI survey showed that some businesses were 'not quite so pessimistic' as
they had been in January.
She argued that the desperate attempts by ministers to obscure their
responsibility for the recession 'fuels the optimism to which they lay
claim'.
Mr Mellor forecast that the recovery of confidence would lead to an increase
in economic activity.
He was adamant that the British economy was far better equipped to get out
of the current recession than it was from the recession in the early 1980s.
The government's optimism was also challenged by Mr Pat Duffy (Lab Sheffield
Attercliffe) who said a survey showed that there had not been a recovery of
confidence among manufacturing employers in South Yorkshire.
expressed by Mr David Winnick (Lab Walsall North) who said the West Midlands
was going through a repeat of the 1980s recession.
Undeterred, Mr Mellor suggested that part of the problem faced by the
manufacturing sector was that 'perception lagged behind reality'.
He received support from Mr Roger King (C Northfield) who stressed that in
terms of exports the British motor car industry was 'doing better than ever
before'.
Mr Mellor praised the export achievements of the car industry which, he
said, reflected the transformation which had taken place in the British
economy in the 1980s.
Mrs Beckett maintained that the government discounted 'alarming evidence'
about the depth of the recession in order to promote its claims that
recovery was at hand.
She said there was a danger that when the recovery did take place it would
prove to be 'shallow and short lived' as the balance of payments constraints
re-emerged.
Mr Ian Taylor (C Esher) criticised the high street banks for imposing a
'higher than necessary' premium when setting interest rates on loans to
their smaller corporate clients. He referred to reports that some banks were
charging more than 2 to 2 1/2 percentage points above base rates.
Mr Taylor also expressed concern that the Lloyds insurance market might be
'at the beginning of a crisis' and urged the Government to consider
permitting 'names' to claim tax relief on current year cash calls.
A warning that the bloodstock industry would be 'greatly disadvantaged' by
the new VAT regime due to come into operation in 1993 was given by Mr
William Powell (C Corby). He urged Treasury minister Mrs Gillian Shephard,
who is to meet industry representatives next week, to try to remedy the
situation.
Mr Francis Maude, financial secretary to the Treasury, defended the new
impost on mobile telephones, insisting that 'a straight forward and modest
scale charge' would reduce the burden on small businesses.
Mr Mellor rejected protests from Conservative backbenchers that the Bill
subjected building societies to double taxation. He insisted that if clause
50 were to be deleted, a number of building societies would make 'windfall
profits' from Pounds 250m tax paid on money from depositors.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Parties optimistic about national
poll 'rehearsal' - Local Council Elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday marked the closing stages of the local elections
campaign with a confident claim that the outcome would underline that it is
on course for a fourth general election victory - but not quite yet.
On a day when all of the main contenders in tomorrow's poll announced
advance plans to celebrate their success, Mr Chris Patten delivered an
ebullient assessment of the Conservatives' recent recovery in the opinion
polls.
In a series of characteristically eliptical statements he did nothing to
dispel the impression that Mr John Major, the prime minister, will wait at
least until the Autumn for a general election.
Although the Conservatives' appear to have a fractional lead in the opinion
polls, it is fighting tomorrow's elections from the much higher base it
achieved in 1987, when it was a full 10 points ahead. So this year, Mr
Patten can expect substantial losses in terms of council seats.
The lengthening odds against a June poll - the view at Conservative Central
Office is that the 6 to 1 against offered by the bookmakers is a fair
assessment - did nothing to diminish the energy of Labour's campaigning.
Flanked by senior members of the shadow cabinet, Mr Jack Cunningham, the
party's campaigns manager, indicated that Labour remained determined to keep
national attention focused on its chosen electoral battlegrounds.
The Labour team, which has treated the local elections as a dress-rehearsal
for a general election, produced a sheaf of new figures to reinforce its
attack on the government's handling of the economy.
Mr Tony Blair, the employment spokesman, claimed the recent rise in
unemployment was hitting Tory voters as hard as Labour, while Mr Gordon
Brown, the shadow industry spokesman, offered scores of statistics to
illustrate the decline in Britain's manufacturing base.
Mr Blair said that the rising jobless total - now presented by Labour as a
symbol of the government's wider mismanagement of the economy - demonstrated
that Mr Major had produced a 'classless' recession. White-collar employees
were as badly hit as blue-collar workers, the south as much as the north.
Labour's stance on strictly local issues was helped by another apparent
volte-face by the government on the details of its new council tax.
Whitehall officials said last week that the Government was considering
increasing the number of property bands from 7 to 9. Yesterday, however, Mr
Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, ruled out categorically any
such switch.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, offered the prediction that
his party would do much better than its opinion poll standing suggests. He
argued - correctly - that its performance in recent local elections had
consistently confounded the pundits.

THE LABOUR Party promised a 'fresh start' review of competition, consumer
choice, and prices in the brewing industry, Philip Rawstorne writes.
Government orders introduced after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
report on the industry, had 'failed to stem the tide of takeovers and
closures,' said Mr Doug Henderson, a Labour trade and industry spokesman.
Government changes had done nothing to to cut the price of a pint or give
consumers greater choice of beers. Retail prices had increased by 142 per
cent between March 1979 and March 1991. Beer prices rose by 222 per cent
over the same period, he said.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Move from recession in sight, say economists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE-SECTOR economists yesterday gave tentative support to the
government's assertion that the economy will start to move out of recession
in the second half of the year.
Oxford Economic Forecasting, the research consultancy, and Mr David Kern,
chief economist at National Westminster Bank, agreed that a modest recovery
would start in the third quarter.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said in Washington on Monday that an end
to the recession was 'round the corner'. When urged to be more precise, he
said it would occur around the end of the second quarter.
The Oxford-based economists predicted that gross domestic product over 1991
would fall by 1.8 per cent and manufacturing output by 4.9 per cent. They
expected un-employment to reach 2.5m by the end of the year.
They also predicted that interest rates would then be down to 10.5 per cent,
but added that record levels of corporate indebtedness made prospects for
investment 'very bleak'.
'Only housebuilding shows modest signs of recovery in the second half of
1991 as the housing market begins to recover,' the economists said. They
added that any upturn would have to come from the personal sector or from
overseas.
Mr Kern predicted in NatWest's Economic and Financial Outlook that
unemployment - now at 2.1m - would rise by a further 700,000 by mid-1992,
the deadline for calling an election.
The Bank of England's final money-supply data for March were little changed
from its provisional data. M0 (mainly notes and coin) rose at an annual 2.7
per cent, and M4 (sterling bank and building society lending) by 9.9 per
cent.

FT  01 MAY 91 / High Court told of Lloyd's 'running sore'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART FLEMING and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INADEQUACIES in the way the authorities at Lloyd's of London disclosed
information to Names about disciplinary proceedings in the insurance market
were highlighted yesterday at the High Court in the third day of a civil
case brought against the Corporation of Lloyd's by 33 Names.
The Names, or members, backed four syndicates managed by Oakeley Vaughan
underwriting agencies between 1980 and 1982. Mr Michael Lyndon-Stanford QC,
who is acting for 24 Names, said that the Oakeley Vaughan syndicates had
been a 'running sore' for Lloyd's through 1981 and right up to the end of
1982.
Lloyd's investigations uncovered inadequate financial management at Oakeley
Vaughan. The Names were not told of these problems partly because of what he
termed a 'lack of resolution' at the top of Lloyd's.
Following an internal inquiry which had revealed evidence of writing more
premium income than permitted by market rules and other irregularities,
Lloyd's had suspended three directors of Oakeley Vaughan - Mr Barry Bowen,
Mr Michael White-lock and Mr James St George  - for two years in September
1981.
The three men had also been forbidden from holding any directorship or
partnership in an agency doing business at Lloyd's for five years. Names,
however, were told nothing of this. A letter from Oakeley Vaughan to Names,
dated October 8 1981, said that Mr Bowen had simply resigned, Mr
Lyndon-Stanford said. Subsequently the Lloyd's committee agreed that another
director, Mr Charles St George, should be publicly reprimanded. However, Mr
Lyndon-Stanford said that this was changed to a private reprimand, being
confirmed in a letter sent to Mr Charles St George on December 4. Mr St
George subsequently wrote to Lloyd's refusing to accept the reprimand. Mr
Lyndon-Stanford suggested Lloyd's should have written to the Names giving
them fuller information and that the Names were unable to make an informed
decision on whether to continue to participate in the Oakeley Vaughan
businesses.
The case continues today.

FT  01 MAY 91 / False start in export insurance race: The sale of an ECGD
unit appears in disarray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORTERS, who have long campaigned against the proposed privatisation of
the short-term insurance business of the Export Credits Guarantee
Department, believed they finally had the government on the run as the
deadline for bids passed yesterday.
Three responses were received to the invitation to tender, but only two  -
from Italy's Assicurazioni Generali and NCM of Holland - constituted bids in
the formal sense. Trade Indemnity replied with an offer of collaboration,
but did not put any money on the table.
It was a sorry end to the first lap of a race started less than two months
ago with six supposedly keen bidders. The private and public explanations
given by some who dropped by the wayside have added to the impression of
chaos and disarray in the government camp.
The government has long seen privatisation as essential if ECGD is to
compete in the 1992 single European market for credit insurance business.
Few guessed before the bidding began quite how difficult the sale was going
to prove - or how much harder the government would make it by refusing to
give a commitment to reinsure credits to developing countries where the
political situation was seen as risky.
For example, when Cobac of Belgium dropped out it warned that this policy
was putting British exporters at a structural disadvantage. Sun Alliance
felt the prospective net annual premium income of Pounds 22m was inadequate
given the investment needed to build up the business. Other bidders were
worried about the fragility of the customer base and overmanning at the
Cardiff-based division.
The impression is that the professionals who have looked at the government's
offer document concluded that the business, once expected to command a
purchase price of Pounds 100m or more, is not worth very much. The force of
their reaction has even caused the government's nerve to falter slightly.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, who has been studiously dismissive of
industry worries about political-risk insurance, is seeking fresh
consultations with exporters. The government has postponed until June
putting the privatisation bill before the House of Lords, where it may face
a revolt among its supporters.
Exporters have been slow to take Generali seriously as a potential buyer. It
has a 22 per cent stake in SIAC, the private-sector Italian credit insurance
concern, but it is a newcomer to the niche market of credit insurance and
has no track record.
From the government's perspective, Generali is appealing in a number of
areas. It is a well-established international insurance company with a
long-term outlook, a strong balance sheet and profits equivalent to Dollars
450m (Pounds 250m) in 1989. This gives it ample resources to develop the
business and clout in the re-insurance market whose involvement is seen as
vital as Whitehall progressively withdraws support.
Generali also has a tradition of allowing its subsidiaries a considerable
degree of managerial autonomy. Some industry experts believe it would
mandate ECGD's existing management to use the support of its existing
operations to develop a pan-European credit insurance more or less from
scratch.
This is potentially more exciting than the prospect offered by NCM, which
has also said it would grant the Cardiff-based ECGD group considerable
autonomy. But, with NCM in ultimate charge, the scope for developing a
European business out of Cardiff would inevitably be limited by the new
owner's aspirations to do the same out of Amsterdam.
NCM has impressed exporters with the professionalism of its management.
Though it has only limited financial resources compared with Generali,
exporters say it has a sound track record in credit insurance. Yet NCM needs
to expand out of the limited Dutch market if it is to grow large enough to
cope with 1992. Many believe its interest lies primarily in acquiring a base
from which to attack the UK domestic credit insurance market, now dominated
by Trade Indemnity, rather than to expand Cardiff's export credit business.
Trade Indemnity argues that a marriage of its expertise in domestic credit
insurance with Cardiff's skills on export credit would create a powerful UK
force in the broader European market.
An underlying motivation has always been defensive, however. It fears that
any other owner of Cardiff would attack it on its home ground.
The chances of the government taking up its proposal looked slim last night.
The force of its arguments have been dented by its unwillingness to put
money behind its proposals, by negative market reaction to its Pounds 29m
loss for 1990 and by the apparent reluctance of its shareholders to back its
expansion with extra cash through a rights issue.
Whatever happens, none of the UK players will come out looking good. Trade
Indemnity, once the keenest potential bidder, has overplayed its hand and
risks attack in its home market. The government has manifestly misjudged the
market. And ECGD's managers now have to explain to their staff why they have
been trumpeting their success in building up a dynamic computer-driven
business which no right-minded British company actually wants to buy.

<TEXT>
MR WALLACE Duncan Smith, chairman of Wallace Smith Trust, a small London
banking and finance group, was yesterday remanded in custody for a week by
Guildhall magistrates on a charge of fraudulent trading.
He was arrested by the City of London police on Monday and held in custody
before being charged.
The police said yesterday that the charge alleged that between January 1
1985 and April 29 1991, in the City of London and elsewhere, Mr Smith was
knowingly party to the carrying on of the business of Wallace Smith Trust
with intent to defraud its creditors.
The charge, under section 458 of the 1985 Companies Act, carries a penalty
of a prison sentence, or a fine, or both. The Serious Fraud Office said
yesterday that it had taken over the case from the City police.
Provisional liquidators were appointed to Wallace Smith Trust yesterday on a
petition by the Bank of England. The company has ceased trading and the
liquidators are realising the outstanding positions. The provisional
liquidators are Mr Tim Hayward and Mr Bill Ratford of KPMG Peat Marwick
McLintock.
According to its latest annual report, the net assets of the bank are about
Pounds 13m. No deposits from the general public are believed to be at risk.
Mr Duncan Smith is one of the backers of the Bruges Group, the pressure
group opposed to European federalism.
Wallace Smith Trust is owned by a trust representing the Smith family, which
has extensive financial interests in Canada. It specialised in dealing in
the money market, and in corporate finance. Its latest accounts show that it
had assets of Pounds 370m, most of which consisted of money market
instruments. Its share capital and reserves amounted to Pounds 13.2m. The
other directors are Mr Michael Hamilton, joint managing director, and Mr JM
Bradley.
In the year ended April 30 1990, it made a profit of Pounds 175,000, down
from Pounds 1.5m the year before. An associated company, Wallace Smith Trust
Group, lost Pounds 1m in the same period.

THE treasurer of NatWest Investment Bank saw nothing fraudulent in County
NatWest and Phillips &amp; Drew buying Blue Arrow shares in the 1987 rights
issue, the Blue Arrow trial heard yesterday, writes John Mason.
Mr John Owen, a prosecution witness, said he had seen no evidence of any
dishonesty in County NatWest and P&amp;D buying shares in the Pounds 837m rights
issue.
He agreed with Mr Jeremy Roberts, QC for Mr Jonathan Cohen, a former County
chief executive and one of the defendants, that he believed full legal
advice had been taken.
Cross-examined by Mr Roy Amlot, QC for Mr Alan Keat of Travers Smith
Braithwaite, the firm of solicitors which advised County, Mr Owen agreed
nobody had told him the legal advice given was of a general nature and had
been taken before the issue, not at the time of its closure. Later, he told
Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, prosecuting, that the markets would not have
expected holdings of that nature.
County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and
seven individuals deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the outcome of
the issue. The trial continues today.

'You not speaking to us any more, Sammy?' shouted a radio journalist from
the temporary barrier beside the Stormont parliament building outside
Belfast.
Mr Sammy Wilson, the youthful, straggly-haired and normally loquacious press
officer of the Democratic Unionist Party turned and smiled. But he said
nothing.
Silence and discretion were the better part of historic talks on the future
of Northern Ireland which started yesterday.
Reporters were unable to get within 50 yards of the participants - except
for staged pictures of arrivals, or by chasing the processions of polished
Ford Granada and Rover saloons that sped through the 300 acres of landscaped
gardens around Stormont.
It did not go quite to plan. Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social
Democratic and Labour Party, missed the entrance set aside for delegations.
He drew up his slate grey Granada in the car park, forcing him to walk
through the waiting media circus. 'Be patient,' he urged.
A lone protester, Mr Cedric Wilson, former DUP mayor of Castlereagh,
scrambled up the grassy banks around the parliament building to shout: 'No
surrender to Dublin rule.'
The SDLP was the first party to hold bilateral talks with Mr Peter Brooke,
Northern Ireland secretary. Unionist leaders will not meet him officially
until Friday with the first round-table discussions starting probably early
next week. The date of the Irish government's involvement is yet to be
determined.
Later, a hunched Mr Hume fumbled with his car keys, trying to avoid
questions. He would say only that talks had been about 'setting out the
machinery and agenda for the talks'. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader, sucked
his pipe as he got in the other side.
By afternoon the arrangements had been sorted out. Dr John Alderdice, leader
of the Alliance party, arrived 15 minutes ahead of schedule, as silent as
the classical Greek columns of the 1920's parliament building.
Before 1972, Stormont was a living parliament. Now, empty but still
majestically overlooking Belfast suburbs, it is a monument to two decades of
direct rule from Westminster.
all sides should keep discussions confidential, through fear of raising
passions by misunderstandings. That the parties have followed suit
underlines apparent determination to give the talks a chance of success in
spite of difficulties. It is the first time nationalists and unionists have
sat at the same table for 15 years.
Mr Brooke himself said nothing to the press all day. The media have been
confined to portable cabins erected beside the west wing for the duration of
talks for which 11 weeks have been set aside and extensive preparations
made. There are vending machines, fax machines and photocopying facilities.
The Northern Ireland Office, at least, is not expecting an early breakdown.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Chinese works boost ailing art market: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IF THE art market was looking for signs of a revival it found them in Hong
Kong yesterday when the first session of Sotheby's auction of Chinese works
of art totalled HKDollars 56m (Pounds 4.3m), with only 4 per cent unsold.
The estimates had been kept low to encourage bidding and all 10 most
expensive lots found Hong Kong and Taiwanese buyers.
Mr TT Tsui, the Hong Kong businessman, twice paid Pounds 588,811: once for a
Yuan Dynasty blue and white dish of the 14th century with a Persian/Arabic
inscription, and once for a early Ming blue and white ewer.
At Christie's in London a sale of orders and decorations achieved Pounds
270,000, with just 3 per cent unsold. Top price was the Pounds 29,700 paid
by Spink, the London dealer, for the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle which
Kaiser Wilhelm II awarded to Sultan Abbas II of Turkey in 1914. It was part
of the German campaign to turn the Ottoman Empire against the Allies.
The price of fame was illustrated in the Pounds 6,820 paid by a private
Scottish collector for the Order of Merit awarded in 1977 to Sir Frederick
Ashton, founder and principal choreographer of the Royal Ballet, who died in
1988. The OM is a rarely awarded British civilian honour and the gold medal
seldom appears at auction.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Recovery in unit trust sales continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recovery in the unit trust market this year continued in March, when
investors bought Pounds 1.19bn worth of units.
The March figure, following sales of Pounds 1.32bn in February, reflected
continuing buoyancy in stock markets worldwide this year and brought the
gross amount invested in units in the first quarter to almost Pounds 3.2bn.
This was nearly a fifth more than in the first quarter of last year.
However, unitholders cashed in Pounds 880.9m worth of units in March,
boosted by activity at the end of the financial year by certain life
companies and other financial institutions. This brought total cash-ins for
the quarter to Pounds 1.92m - still 15 per cent lower than in the first
quarter of last year.
Net new investment in unit trusts in March was Pounds 308.5m - less than
half new investment in February of Pounds 836.5m but greater than any
monthly figure in 1990. Net new investment so far this year, at Pounds
1.27bn, is triple that for the corresponding period last year.
Further analysis of the figures from the Unit Trust Association shows that
investors were interested in trusts across the whole spectrum, with
particular interest in Japan.
Funds under management rose by nearly Pounds 10bn over the quarter to Pounds
56.2bn. Figures were boosted by record sales of unit trust Personal Equity
Plans amounting to Pounds 229m.
The government yesterday paved the way for new rules governing the borrowing
and investment powers of unit trusts, due to be published in draft form by
the Securities and Investments Board today.
The Department of Trade and Industry laid two orders before parliament
enabling it to delegate rule-making in this area to SIB.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL NUKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE troubled Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory
Association has thrown its hat in the ring as a potential supervisory body
of the 'multi-tied' financial advisers.
Such advisers are expected to emerge after the Securities and Investment
Board's review of the way packaged investment products are sold to the
public.
Mr Godfrey Jillings, chief executive of Fimbra, which supervises independent
financial advisers, said he would consider the creation of a new category of
'multi-tied' financial advisers if they were regulated by his organisation
and did not threaten the future viability of the independent sector.
'Multi-tied' advisers would sell several companies' products, standing
between independent advisers (who advise on all products on the market) and
tied agents (who sell only one company's products).
Recommendations on how banks should account for loans were proposed in a
draft statement put forward by the British Bankers Association yesterday.
The Statement of Recommended Accounting Practice (SORP) addresses issues
such as the valuation of advances, treatment of provisions, recognition of
interest and fees, and disclosure of concentrations of exposure.
It proposes, for example, that banks should list their exposure to countries
with financial problems.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Tribunal's pension ruling to face appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT, Pensions Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HICK HARGREAVES, the Bolton-based engineering company, is to appeal against
the decision of Manchester industrial tribunal that Mr Alan Roscoe, a former
company employee, had suffered unlawful discrimination on grounds of sex by
being given a reduced pension.
The decision to appeal opens the way for the case to be referred to the
European Court of Justice for clarification of the retrospection aspects of
the Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange judgment nearly a year ago.
The European Court ruled in its Barber judgment that pensions counted as pay
under Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome. But it also stated that to avoid
upsetting the financial balance of schemes, equalisation would apply only to
pension entitlements arising after the date of the judgment - May 17 1990.
That has led to confusion over the definition of pension entitlements.
Mr John Bellis, a chairman of the Manchester industrial tribunal, upheld Mr
Roscoe's contention that as he retired after the date of the judgment he
should have received a full pension at the same level as that of a woman.
Mr Bellis disagreed with Hick Hargreaves, which took the view that it need
only equalise pension benefits accruing from the date of the judgment and
reduced his pension by 27 per cent compared with that of a woman. Mr Roscoe
retired at 60, five years earlier than the company's normal retirement age
for men. The Equal Opportunities Commission, which is backing Mr Roscoe,
hopes to secure an early hearing in the Employment Appeals Tribunal and will
ask it to refer the case to the European Court.
This is the second test case being put forward to clarify the Barber
judgment. Last week, the independent trustees of the Coloroll Group Pension
Schemes announced that they were seeking guidance from the High Court on
winding up the schemes.

Last May it won observer status in Gatt itself, and in March this year
similar standing on Gatt's import licensing committee. Moscow now has access
to two of the codes to which Gatt members subscribe separately, which are
meant mainly to lower non-tariff obstacles to trade.

FT  01 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Tokyo warns EC on audio cassette 'dumping'
duties
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE companies could cut their investments in the EC, if Brussels
imposes definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of audio cassettes, Tokyo
warned yesterday.
Japan reserved its right to seek redress from Gatt, should Brussels go ahead
with its plan to make definitive the duties of 14.7-22.3 per cent it imposed
provisionally last November.
The EC Commission is expected to announce its decision shortly, in a case
which has aroused doubt among some EC member states, including the UK, and
strong opposition from foreign exporters.
In sharp terms, Japan told Gatt's anti-dumping committee yesterday that a
decision to make duties on audio cassettes definitive would violate the
anti-dumping code, and have 'a serious adverse effect on inward investment'.
Brussels had failed to demonstrate any causal link between the alleged
dumping by Japanese companies and injury caused to EC industry, Japan said.
The Commission says the market share of the EC industry had fallen from 27
per cent in 1985 to 19 per cent in 1988, while the share of Japanese, Korean
and Hong Kong companies alleged to have dumped had increased from 72 to 81
per cent.
But the share of companies found to have dumped included increased output by
Japanese affiliates in the EC, Japan claimed. Also, the EC allegation of
price-cutting concerned products sold only in Germany, which could not be
construed to constitute injury to the entire EC market.
Separately, Japan complained about the way the EC Commission had been
reviewing duties imposed on electronic typewriters and urged the US to halt
an investigation into the Brother company's production of portable electric
typewriters in the US.
In reviewing the typewriter charges, the Commission had asked Japanese
companies for information on word processor production. This extension of
the investigation could have no relation to a decision on whether to
continue anti-dumping duties on typewriters. It was unnecessarily burdening
the companies and interrupting trade flows, Japan said.
The US Department of Commerce is investigating a complaint by Smith Corona
that Brother is making portable electric typewriters in the US, to
circumvent an anti-dumping duty on imports.
Japan said the percentage by value of the non-Japanese components in
Brother's portable typewriters and word processors produced in the US was
more than 50 per cent. Smith Corona was the main importer of portable
electric typewriters but produced none of its own domestically. The Commerce
Department had opened its investigation without determining whether Smith
Corona's complaint was valid.

FT  01 MAY 91 / World Trade News: EC on US priority watch list in
broadcasting row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has for the first time put the EC on its 'priority watch list' under
the Special 301 provision of its Trade Act, because of barriers to entry of
US TV programming embodied in EC broadcasting legislation.
It has begun a separate action under Title 7 of the Act which could
theoretically end in a ban on public procurement from EC sources. This is
because of alleged EC discrimination against US suppliers in its public
contracts policy.
These moves are seen by Commission officials as pouring fuel on an EC-US
trade relationship already heated by the Uruguay Round transatlantic farm
subsidy row.
The row over the broadcasting directive, which comes into effect on October
3, has been long and vexed. The legislation originally proposed limiting
transmission of non-EC programming to under half, but now merely suggests
this as a guideline.
The alleged discrimination, and the margin of discretion for member states
to implement it, has angered the US. Washington says this will not provide a
single market for US broadcasting exports. The Special 301 move is seen here
as a sign the US wants its complaints 'taken very seriously', a Commission
official said.
The EC has been moved from the 'watch' list to 'priority watch' for the
first time. Germany, Italy, Greece and Spain have separately been on this
list, kept for the most 'onerous' alleged intellectual property
infringements.
Brussels officials say the dispute should be handled within the Uruguay
Round. They say that while the broadcasting directive is not yet law, the US
has failed to implement a 1989 Gatt panel ruling requiring it to cease
discriminating against imports accused of infringing patents.
US products similarly accused got more favourable treatment, Gatt found.
Officials claim the procurement dispute should be settled within the Round,
since the 'buy Europe' provisions the US is attacking are not yet in force.
These would, from 1993, allow buyers for government-regulated utilities to
prefer bids from EC suppliers, if they are no more than 3 per cent dearer
than the best bid from a third country. If no agreement is reached with the
EC in 45 days, the US could hit back with a ban on procurement from European
suppliers.

FT  01 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Warning for paper industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING environmental pressures will make the 1990s a more challenging
decade for the paper industry than the previous turbulent one.
This forecast came yesterday from Mr Stephen Walls, chief executive of
Wiggins Teape Appleton, the EC paper company. He told a pulp and paper
conference organised by the Financial Times and the European Paper Institute
that competition would intensify in the European industry, because of
greater consolidation and over-capacity.
Mr Walls' speech echoed themes touched on earlier by, among others, Mr
Hartwig Geginat, president of the European Paper Institute. Mr Geginat
forecast that demand for paper products would remain strong, with the total
market for paper and board products growing at 3-4 per cent a year in the
next five years.
But he added changing consumer attitudes could affect the quality and
consumption of paper, as governments introduced legislation aimed at cutting
the use of packaging materials. 'Not only is the industry's use of
materials, processes and recycling under attack by pressure groups, but the
product itself is. This represents the main challenge facing the industry
into the next century.'
Mr Desmond Smurfit, joint deputy chairman of Jefferson Smurfit Group, the
Irish paper and packaging company, said the concept of quality would be
critical in the present business environment. The big European players would
continue to get bigger, he added.
Mr Takao Teresaki, a general manager at C. Itoh, the Japanese trading group,
said the Japanese market was suffering from over-capacity, caused by
'overly-aggressive' capital investment. But he forecast the industry would
quickly overcome its difficulties and return to a stable growth of 3-3 1/2
per cent a year.
Mr Hugh Whalen, executive vice-president of Canadian Pacific Forest
Products, said the paper industry was 'all too often at the centre of an
environmental issue, sometimes distorted beyond reason'.

<TEXT>
JAPANESE manufacturers feel comfortable about their presence in Europe and
indicate that, to avoid conflict, localisation of operations and management
is essential.
A recent survey of manufacturers, carried out by the Japan External Trade
Organisation (Jetro), showed the number of companies with at least 10 per
cent Japanese ownership operating in Europe increased to 676 at end-January,
a 27.8 per cent year-on-year rise.
Among these 676, 187 chose the UK as their base, 122 France, 109 Germany,
and 64 Spain, 39 Italy, and 36 the Netherlands. The survey suggests the
reasons were ease of distribution, availability of English-speaking
managers, a pool of skilled workers, and a developed infrastructure.
Almost half the companies responding expressed optimism about relationships
with their local communities. But some 20 per cent expressed concerns about
employee friction triggered by lack of localisation of management or by
Japanese-style management.
Reasons for setting up in Europe were given as avoiding problems with
anti-dumping actions, and reinforcing R&amp;D in Europe. About 40 per cent said
local content of purchased parts had increased.

FT  01 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Bush will need something to show for China
deal / Review of US relations with Peking as MFN trade status decision looms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By YVONNE PRESTON and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN US official Robert Kimmitt meets trade officials in Peking this week,
he is likely to tell them that his president will find it difficult to renew
China's most favoured nation (MFN) status next month without something to
show for it.
After all, US trade representative Carla Hills has just named China, along
with India and Thailand, a 'Special 301 country', whose trade policy is
'egregious' and harmful to US business. That is not very encouraging to
Peking when the trade balance between the two countries is nearing Dollars
10bn in China's favour.
Nor when human rights voices are still berating President George Bush for
renewing China's MFN status last year when the sound of gunfire in Tiananmen
Square had not long died down.
MFN status, which accords certain countries America's best trading
conditions, has been the cornerstone of US-China trade relations for the
last 10 years. As June 3, the date President Bush must make a decision,
draws nearer, Peking has been at pains to emphasise what it sees as the
serious consequences to relations that would result if MFN privileges are
withdrawn.
Premier Li Peng has warned of losses not only to China but to US companies
seeking to do business there. China's foreign minister Qian Qichen said a
decision to rescind MFN status would benefit neither side and deal a bigger
blow to Hong Kong, which re-exports a lot of Chinese-manufactured goods.
China saves hundreds of millions of dollars a year by paying the lowest
tariffs on goods it exports to the US. The loss of MFN status would be a
blow it can ill afford as the mainland recovers from the austerity measures
implemented at the end of 1988. The US is China's largest market, buying
more than 25 per cent of China's exports.
Under the terms of 'Special 301', a provision of US trade law that permits
the US administration to retaliate against named countries considered to be
particularly unfair in their trade practices, Mrs Hills said China and India
had failed to make any concessions during the past two years in negotiations
over US demands for protection of patents, copyrights, trademarks and
software.
Mrs Hills complained that China practised piracy 'across the board'. It is
the only major US trading partner that does not offer product protection for
pharmaceutical and chemicals, adequate copyright or trade protection, nor
safeguards for trade secrets. Failure to improve intellectual property
protection could evoke US sanctions after six to nine months.
The trade representative's office devoted 10 pages in the 1991 trade
estimates report to Chinese deficiencies. These include a complex import
licensing system, import bans on 80 products and materials, stringent and
excessive quality standards on foreign goods, and barriers to services and
investment.
There is further concern in Washington over China's alleged nuclear
technology transfers to countries such as Pakistan and Algeria - and this
surfaced last night when President Bush refused to approved export of US
satellite parts to China. The parts had been requested for a Chinese
domestic communications satellite, the Dong Fang Hong 3.
Peking has, however, strenuously rejected reports from Washington about
nuclear technology sales to Algeria. Yesterday Algeria offered to submit its
nuclear programme to international inspection.
Meanwhile, Peking disputes the figures that show it has a soaring surplus in
its trade with the US, claiming it is nothing like as large as Dollars 10bn.
Premier Li is reported to have said he was ready to look at statistical
methodology with the Americans and put the Chinese view of the figures.
China leaves out of its statistics of exports to the US all products
produced by US joint venture companies in China, and all goods re-exported
through Hong Kong.
This year more human rights concerns have surfaced in the US over
allegations that China exports goods made by prisoners, a charge it
repeatedly denies. The import of prison-made goods is banned in the US.
China's growing anxiety about MFN may explain why it appears to have
abandoned its longstanding position that human rights is a domestic issue by
inviting Australia to send a team of experts to study human rights in the
country. The likelihood is that the decision is related to trading concerns
and its expectation that they may continue if China cannot improve its
image.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Rate cut follows Bush's pressure and poor figures: Fed sees
no clear sign of end to recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Federal Reserve's  1/2 -point cut in the discount rate to 5 1/2 per cent
looks like a consolation prize for President George Bush.
Mr Bush failed this weekend to persuade the finance ministers of other
leading industrial countries to sanction interest rate cuts. But his
influence at home is rather greater.
Yesterday he pointedly praised Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, for his
'strong leadership role' in cutting interest rates. The move, said Mr Bush,
would strengthen the world economy as well as ease the domestic recession.
The Fed cuts the discount rate when it wants to signal changes in monetary
policy. Yesterday's cut - the third   1/2 -point reduction since December -
paved the way for an immediate quarter-point cut in the Federal funds rate
to 5.75 per cent.
The Fed funds rate - the cost of bank reserves in the inter-bank market - is
the key determinant of short-term interest rates in the economy. The
discount rate, the rate the Fed charges on direct loans to commercial banks,
is largely of symbolic importance.
The easing of policy follows a vigorous debate within the Fed about the
conduct of monetary policy. In recent weeks, 'doves' among the governors and
regional presidents reportedly favoured easing, but were restrained by
'hawks' who feared that inflation was still not fully under control.
The timing of the cut yesterday surprised many analysts because the debate
was thought to have resulted in a decision to keep policy unchanged for the
time being.
The apparent change of heart probably reflects a combination of intensified
pressure from the White House and growing concern about the recession's
failure to bottom out. In a statement justifying the cut, the Fed said it
was particularly concerned by adverse trends in industrial and capital goods
sectors.
Yesterday the Commerce Department reported a 2.8 per cent fall in March for
orders for manufactured goods, the fifth successive monthly decline. Orders
for durable goods fell 6 per cent in March.
There was also discouraging news on the demand side of the economy. The
momentum of a sharp rise in consumer confidence in March was not sustained
in April. The New York-based forecasting group Conference Board yesterday
said its overall measure of consumer confidence fell nearly two points to
79.2 last month, having climbed 22 points immediately after the Gulf war.
The Fed's decision to 'buy insurance' against a deeper recession also
reflects broader economic trends. Figures last week showed that real gross
national product fell at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent in the first
quarter, compared with 1.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year. In
January the White House had claimed that the worst of the recession was over
and predicted a fall of GNP at an annual rate of 1.3 per cent in the first
quarter.
Non-farm employment has contracted by 1.3m since last September - in line
with falls in previous severe recessions. Industrial production is already
down nearly 5 per cent from its peak last autumn. Neither indicator shows
any sign of recovery.
Such blunt signals from the industrial economy have undermined confidence
generated by a tentative revival in the housing market, faster monetary
growth and a big rise in share prices.
The Fed's decision was made easier by signs of a decline in the 'core' rate
of inflation. The consumer price index excluding food and energy rose by
only 0.1 per cent in March after large increases earlier this year. With
wage inflation subdued and the dollar if anything too strong for domestic
comfort, the risk that an easing of monetary policy will spark a resurgence
of inflation looks negligible.
How quickly commercial banks will respond to the Fed's move is unclear. In
the past year, banks have been seeking to rebuild profit ratios and have
been reluctant to pass on the benefits of interest rate cuts.
Yesterday, Southwest Bank, a small St Louis bank that often leads
industry-wide moves, cut its prime rate a quarter point to 8 3/4 per cent.
The White House will be hoping that the big money centre banks quickly
follow suit.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Grim prognosis for E European recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SOBER assessment of the timing of economic recovery in eastern Europe has
come in a World Bank report on the region.
It suggests Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary will not regain the income
levels they enjoyed in 1989 until 1996. The prospects for Bulgaria, Romania
and Yugoslavia are even worse; according to the bank, these countries will
not achieve 1989 levels until the next century.
The projections suggest a widening income gap between the region's north -
which is further advanced in economic reform - and the south.
'Simply recovering from the contractions of 1989-91 could take five to 10
years. Reaching the per capita income levels now prevailing in industrial
countries could take decades,' the report says of the region as a whole.
World Bank economists agree that measures of national product fail to take
into account the difference in quality between goods produced under the
centralised system and those available now, and the ending of supply
shortages and queueing.
The study also concludes that economic reforms are unlikely to proceed
smoothly. 'Setbacks can be expected and should not be prematurely
interpreted as failure of the entire reform process.'
The study also attempts to estimate the impact of the breakdown of the old
Comecon trading system within eastern Europe.
Assuming an oil price of Dollars 20.90 a barrel, the average subsidy for
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania was 4.4 per cent of
gross domestic product. The worst hit by Comecon's collapse will be
Bulgaria, where the implicit subsidy was equivalent to 12.1 per cent of GDP.
In Czechoslovakia the figure was 7 per cent, in Hungary 5.9 per cent, in
Poland 5.0 per cent and in Romania 0.8 per cent.
The report, yet to be formally published, rejects the idea of a linear
sequence of reforms, calling instead for 'complementary packages' of
reforms.

<TEXT>
TWO London-based companies were among 48 groups and banks named last night
by the US Treasury as alleged agents of the Libyan government and therefore
subject to the American economic embargo against that country.
The action is part of a continuing Treasury investigation of Libyan efforts
to engage in financial transactions and to buy goods in circumvention of the
embargo.
No US companies are on the list. The majority of the companies named are
based in Arab and Mediterranean countries and many have specific links to
Libya in their title.
The 48 companies are now considered specially designated nationals or agents
of the Libyan government, bringing them under the embargo and assets freeze
put in place in January 1986. All assets of such entities within US
jurisdiction, including overseas branches of US banks, are blocked and
transactions by US persons with such entities are banned. There are criminal
penalties of fines and prison terms for breaches.
Mr Richard Newcomb, director of the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets
Control, said last night: 'Libya's policies and actions, including its
continued refusal to disavow terrorism as a tool of international policy,
make such a listing particularly useful in redirecting public attention to
the comprehensive sanctions programme in place against Libya.'

FT  01 MAY 91 / At last, Bush gets his first opponent: The emergence of a
Democrat presidential hopeful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST Democrat willing to try his luck in the race next year for US
President has emerged from the political wilderness. Mr Paul Tsongas, a
former Massachusetts senator who yesterday announced his candidacy for his
party's nomination, has everything against him - except a record of beating
impossible odds.
The times do not seem propitious for any Democratic candidate, which is why
Mr Tsongas is, so far, alone in the race. Although the lustre of Operation
Desert Storm has dimmed and the recession seems inclined to linger,
President George Bush is still extraordinarily popular.
Mr Bush has also proved himself a politician who will stop at very little to
win elections; he could well make mincemeat of this unabashed idealist who
dares opponents to put their own beliefs on the table because he thinks
presidential campaigns should be a debate over issues.
Mr Tsongas's admirers say he is a deep thinker, unafraid to take unpopular
stands. He admits that he would have voted against the Gulf war had he been
in the Senate; he pushes a petrol tax and nuclear energy.
Mr Tsongas has not so much been out of the national limelight as much as he
was barely ever in it. He says he has been the underdog in every political
contest he ever entered. After serving two congressional terms and one in
the Senate, he left Washington seven years ago aged 42 with leukaemia and
little hope of surviving.
With bone marrow transplants, massive chemotherapy and radiation, he beat
the affliction into remission and emerged 'thin as a rail, bald as a
billiard ball' and with a belief that he was spared for a purpose.
Since leaving Washington, he says, 'I've travelled to places in the mind
that I'd never visited before, and things which were boring to me are now
wondrous and things which were wondrous now really don't interest me.'
His mission is his message, outlined in an 80-page book, A Call to Economic
Arms, a pro-business manifesto designed both to reform the Democratic Party
and to halt economic decline by re-invigorating the industrial sector.
Democrats must do more than seek to redistribute the national wealth, he
says, because the economic pie is shrinking. 'They are going to have to sit
down with the business community and jointly establish policies of wealth
creation.'
He would seek energy independence through conservation and nuclear power,
make selective cuts in capital gains taxes to promote competitiveness,
provide new seed money and tax credits for research and development, abolish
quarterly reports for businesses.
He decries 'demagogic appeals to protectionism' by the Democratic Party as
well as 'corporate bashing, class warfare, and ideology'. Yet he denounces
the selling of US assets to foreign interests as 'all the blood, sweat and
tears of our forebears on the auction block'.

<TEXT>
ALLIED forces expanded their military presence in northern Iraq yesterday as
Britain's proposal for the United Nations to send its own police units to
protect thousands of returning Kurdish refugees appeared to gather more
support.
UN diplomats said a letter from Mr John Major, the British prime minister,
was delivered to Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the UN secretary-general, who
discussed the plan with Sir David Hannay, Britain's UN representative, and
other western delegates. A UN source said he saw merit in the police force
proposal and felt it could be carried out, possibly without need for a
formal Security Council resolution.
There were conflicting reports about the exact contents of the letter, with
reports in London that Mr Major had been critical of the UN's 'tardy'
approach to the relief effort.
The UN, however, said last night that the letter had not been critical and
had been supportive of the secretary-general's efforts.
While diplomatic manoeuvres continued, allied military vehicles were seen
carrying Kurdish refugee women and children from Isikveren camp on the
Turkish-Iraqi border through Kurdish guerrilla checkpoints towards the
so-called 'safe haven' on the edge of the northern town of Zakho, where UN
officials hoisted their blue-and-white flag yesterday.
British Chinook helicopters landed companies of Royal Marines on hilltops
near the village of Kani Masi, about 90km east of Zakho, while Dutch and US
troops secured bridges and mountain tracks.
The second phase of the repatriation operation, expected today, involves
allied troops establishing a perimeter around the refugee sanctuary.
Until Monday evening Kurdish guerrillas had prevented most refugees from
leaving their mountain camps for the allied zone in Iraq, saying that they
wanted to be assured of the refugees' safety.
Western diplomats at the UN in New York yesterday emphasised their view that
the secretary-general had adequate authority to deploy UN civilian police in
the area. The Soviet Union and China, the other permanent members of the
Security Council, were described as 'not negative' to Britain's suggestion.

FT  01 MAY 91 / UK companies step up Iraq blacklist campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE IS mounting on the US Treasury to issue a revised blacklist of
alleged 'front companies and agents' of Iraq, following action on Monday to
remove three British names from suspicion.
The UK's Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that eight
companies and two individuals listed had met officials in attempts to clear
their names, and it was speaking with others. A total of 33 British
companies were originally named by the US Treasury's Office of Foreign
Assets Control (OFAC) as 'specially designated nationals' on April 1.
Contact with them was prohibited under penalty of fines and imprisonment.
The US blacklist includes 52 companies and 37 individuals worldwide and has
been criticised for inaccuracy. Representations have been made to Washington
by DTI officials and at least one MP.
PMK, Qudos and Liverpool Polytechnic were granted a Treasury licence to
continue trading with companies and individuals under US jurisdiction,
pending removal from the blacklist. PMK was set up by Liverpool Polytechnic
to provide educational facilities to the University of Technology in
Baghdad. Qudos, a designer of specialist microchips based in Cambridge, was
to be a subcontractor. However, no contract was signed and no business took
place.
A spokesman for Liverpool Polytechnic said it was delighted to be removed
from the list. 'We would still question why we were ever included. The
damage to suppliers, parents and staff is immeasurable.'
OFAC said it was reviewing a number of other companies and individuals on
the list but was not planning to remove them at this stage.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHEL ROCARD leaves New Zealand today after a pilgrimage in which he
apologised for the wrong done to New Zealand by France for the bombing of
the Greenpeace vessel, Rainbow Warrior.
On other matters he was far from conciliatory, however. He remained adamant
that France would continue to test nuclear weapons in the Pacific, and told
business and farming leaders that France would not be pushed faster than it
wanted in lowering protective barriers for agricultural products.
In a hectic three-day visit, the first by a European prime minister since
Harold Macmillan in 1958, Mr Rocard was seen to court unpopularity at home
by his willingness to shoulder French responsibility for the Rainbow Warrior
affair and later problems surrounding the captivity of the French agents
responsible in the Pacific. Mr Rocard personally set up the friendship
cultural exchange programme being funded by a Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.1m)
donation from France as recommended by the United Nations tribunal which
mediated in the dispute that ensued. Talks with Mr Jim Bolger, the New
Zealand prime minister and other leaders were harmonious. Mr Rocard showed
determination to strengthen French influence in the Pacific as a counter to
Japan.
Spokesmen said afterwards that New Zealand attempts to move Mr Rocard on the
topic of nuclear testing got nowhere.
He repeatedly emphasised that the tests posed no threat to the region, and
France wished to maintain an independent nuclear deterrent. He said it was a
'weird idea that France should get rid of the one thing that kept war away
from us'. Mr Bolger said that New Zealand would much prefer France to carry
out the tests at home in Europe. Most of Mr Rocard's appearances were marked
by anti-nuclear protests.
He also spoke to a gathering of business leaders in which he sharply
criticised the Cairns group of agricultural exporting nations, to which New
Zealand belongs, as 'extreme' in its calls for trade reform. He called for
the Gatt negotiations to continue 'in relative silence' to allow some form
of settlement to be reached.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Russia and Baltics set up own bank system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian Federation is setting up an alternative banking system with the
Baltic republics in an attempt to replace the edict of the Soviet central
bank.
Mr Georgy Matyukhin, the chairman of the Russian central bank, said in an
interview with the weekly Rossiskaya Gazeta yesterday that the Soviet
central bank had to be dissolved. He invited other republics to join with
the Russian bank, and the banks of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, in
developing the alternative council of republican banks.
His comments come at a time when Mr Victor Geraschenko, the Soviet state
bank chairman, has won government backing for his call for tighter control
over the republican banks. Hitherto, they had functioned merely as local
branches of the Soviet state bank.
Mr Matyukhin said the Russian government would soon pass a law prohibiting
the 'confiscation' of foreign currency earnings from enterprises and banks
on Russian territory - the main source of the union government's hard
currency earnings. Such a law would run counter to the government's
anti-crisis plan, which explicitly foreshadows harsh measures against
republican institutions which withhold funds from the centre.
The buying and selling of hard currency by Russian enterprises and citizens
will be permitted under a further law, Mr Matyukhin said. 'This will help
introduce partial convertibility of the rouble. Foreign currency regulation
on the territory is an inseparable part of Russia's sovereignty'.
'Accounting centres' were being established in Russian cities, he said,
which brought together commercial and savings banks and insurance offices.
'The successful functioning of the banking system will depend on them. The
money flow will be horizontal between them, not vertical between each of
them and the centre.'
Mr Matyukhin said control of the new commercial banks by the central banks
would be on the western model, and a law would be adopted to reflect the new
conditions. 'We are studying American, British and German experience in this
field. Supervision should not be perceived primitively. We are not going to
breathe down their necks and shuffle their papers'.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Price rises 'increase Soviet poverty'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW broke out within the Soviet government yesterday over a report
claiming that recent price rises were putting more than half the population
at or below the poverty line.
A meeting of the Security Council, which brings President Mikhail Gorbachev
together with his main presidential aides, opened with an attack on official
estimates about the price rises by Mr Yevgeny Primakov, recently Mr
Gorbachev's special envoy to the Middle East.
Mr Primakov said that figures showing the minimal subsistence income
required to keep level with the price rises had more than doubled, from
Rbs97 (Pounds 32) a month to Rbs207 (Pounds 68), were more accurate than the
figures presented to the council by the State Price Commission.
These showed prices had gone up on average by 1.5 times, although meat and
its products had tripled, bread had doubled and some items of clothing, like
shoes, had gone up four or five times.
The issue is a particularly touchy one, since the price rises have been
directly responsible for a wave of strikes (at present in abeyance) in
Belorussia and for isolated protests and minor riots in Soviet cities.
The higher average figures, produced by Mr Boris Bolotin, an economist
working for the IMEMO economic think tank, would put nearly half the Soviet
population at or below the poverty line. He defines this as having less than
the minimum income needed to pay for a fixed basket of commodities.
Mr Bolotin calculates that the compensation of Rbs60 a month for the lower
paid does not provide 85 per cent compensation for the price rises, as the
government claims, but only one third.
Figures produced by the newspaper Commersant took a position between the
state committee figures and Mr Bolotin's, showing price rises of 1.7 times.
The newspaper said that the subsistence level in big cities has risen to a
minimum of Rbs186 a month.
The one bright spot - though only for the wealthiest - is that the surge in
state prices has forced down black market prices. Those worst hit are those
who shop mostly at state stores, despite queues and empty shelves.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian leader, said yesterday he thought an agreement
to end the Russian miners' strike was close.
The key issue in ending the strike is the terms under which the mines will
be transferred from Soviet to Russian government control. The terms were
still being thrashed out in the Kuzbas coalfield in Siberia last night.
The miners have decided to continue their strike until the agreement to
transfer is concluded. In another Russian coalfield, Vorkuta, where all the
mines had returned to work, the strike committee said the pits had decided
to resume the strike because the terms of transfer of the Vorkuta coal
associations to Russian jurisdiction had not been defined.
Views were mixed in the Kuzbas field as Mr Yeltsin continued his talks. Mr
Alexander Aslanidi, one of the miners' leaders, said: 'Yeltsin is being well
received.'
However, Mr Alexander Smirnov of the Novokuznets committee in the Kuzbas
said: 'Our committee will raise their own proposals.'
Some pits in the area have already moved to Russian control, while others
have gone further and transformed themselves to enterprises leased to their
workers.
As Mr Yeltsin negotiated, the newspaper Izvestia published an exchange of
May Day telegrams between the Russian leader and President Mikhail Gorbachev
on the signing of the recent joint statement aimed at ending the strikes and
supporting anti-crisis measures.
Mr Yeltsin expressed 'confidence that the path of reconciliation now being
pursued by the centre and Russia . . . will bring co-ordinated actions to
lead the country out of the crisis.'
Mr Gorbachev said he was convinced that the 'constructive co-operation which
has been given new life . . . will allow the return of life in our country
to a normal pattern.'
The agreement is vague on most points, though purported leaks in recent days
point to Mr Gorbachev conceding that a new union treaty would be framed by
the republics themselves, and possibly even promising to hold an election
for the union presidency later this year.
A demonstration of how vague the statement is came when it was also endorsed
yesterday by Mr Yuri Blokhin, co-chairman of the hardline Soyuz group which
had been calling for Mr Gorbachev's resignation, or at least for a special
congress of peoples' deputies to hold him to account for the economic
crisis.
Mr Blokhin said: 'We are glad our ideas are reflected in this document, such
as observance of the constitutional order, introduction of a special regime
in basic industries and improvement of food supplies.'
Mr Yeltsin, for his part, has defined the 'special regime' as a way of
improving productivity.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Brussels secures cut in regional aid for Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has negotiated a substantial cut in German regional
aid to the western parts of the country and west Berlin, in a move designed
to attract more corporate investment to poorer EC states.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, announced yesterday that
Mr Jurgen Mollemann, Bonn's economics minister, had agreed to reduce the
coverage of regional aid in the former west Germany from the current level
of 39 per cent of the population to 27 per cent this year. Special tax and
investment preferences designed to draw companies to the former west Berlin
would go by the end of 1994.
Sir Leon, whose brief is to control state aid that distorts trade or
investment within the EC, hailed the agreement as important to Community
cohesion. 'We need to let aid to the poorer regions work to its full effect,
and this can only be done by limiting the counter-attraction of the richer,
central states of the Community.'
Germany, unlike many of its EC partners, gives most of its aid in the form
of regional, rather than sectoral, schemes. This regional aid has been
running at Ecu4.5bn (Pounds 3.1bn) a year to the former West Germany,
overwhelmingly to west Berlin and the Randgebiet (the zone along the old
border).
EC officials say that in the protracted negotiations with Bonn, which
initially wanted to spread the aid cuts over seven years, they were helped
by two factors. First, Bonn has been searching for savings to offset the
large amounts of money it is spending on east Germany, which have Brussels'
blessing. Second, what used to seem the darkest of depressed areas in the
west has paled before the dereliction in much of the east.
News of the reductions was greeted with caution in Bonn. An economics
ministry official said the agreement would still have to be endorsed by the
Bundestag, but he thought that it would pass largely unscathed.
The business community in west Berlin has greeted the prospect of losing its
subsidies with surprising equanimity.
The main complaint has been the uncertainty over the timing, although the
electronics group, SEL, did say when announcing 2,000 redundancies that the
number might have to increase as a result of losing the Berlin benefits.
The Bonn cabinet yesterday formally agreed to ban the sale of all products
containing ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by 1995. Mr Klaus
Topfer, environment minister, said Germany was the first country to take
such a decision, with the rest of the EC expected to follow in 1997.

<TEXT>
SPAIN HAS decided not to lift its seven-year moratorium on the building of
new nuclear power plants following agreement yesterday to construct a
Dollars 1.3bn pipeline to feed Algerian natural gas into Spain through
Morocco and the Straits of Gibraltar.
Although more than 30 per cent of Spain's electricity is nuclear generated,
the government has had five plants, in various stages of construction, in
mothballs since 1984.
It had been assumed that at least one of them, Valdecaballeros in
Extremadura, would be allowed to come on stream under a new national energy
plan which is due to be announced this summer.
Mr Claudio Aranzadi, the industry and energy minister, said yesterday,
however, that the new energy plan would 'not increase nuclear generating
capacity in Spain'.
He said that the power industry needed to diversify, that increased use of
gas would lower costs and that the decision would help protect the
environment.
The government has come under fierce pressure from the governing Socialist
party not to lift the moratorium, even though private sector utilities have
been pushing hard for Valdecaballeros to be completed.
Mr Aranzadi met Algerian and Moroccan counterparts in Madrid yesterday to
sign an agreement to build a 1,265km pipeline from Algeria to Seville.
The pipeline, which would come on stream in 1995, could eventually link up
with a Soviet line in northern Europe.
Under the terms of yesterday's agreement, a 20-25 year pricing framework
would be established, with tariffs coming up for review every four years.
Financing for the work has still to be negotiated, though a number of
Spanish banks have already expressed strong interest in the project.

Moreover, her ministry, which is one of the few innovations to come out of
the government crisis last month, has no independent budget and has yet to
move into new premises. Even when it is functioning, it will have only 35-40
staff.
Yet Mrs Boniver, a Socialist well known for her role in Amnesty
International and other human rights causes, seems confident about the
unenviable, and seemingly impossible, task of co-ordinating and enforcing
the country's landmark immigration law passed in 1990.
That followed years of lax supervision and a tradition of tolerance, which
made Italy a haven for untold thousands of illegal immigrants, many of them
from poor black African states. More recently, Albanians and Yugoslavs have
swelled their ranks.
However, sentiment towards immigrants has soured sharply as their numbers
have increased and the economy has slowed. The upshot has been a tenser
atmosphere, in which violent racist incidents have become more commonplace.
'Italy considered itself a non-racist country,' says Mrs Boniver, one of two
women ministers in the new government. 'But the Italians woke up startled
one day to realise we too have a strain of racism. There is a strain of
racism in all societies. The job is to keep that under control'.
The trigger in Italy has been the apparently sudden, though unquantified,
leap in untrained black immigrants in particular. Few find jobs and most end
up on the street or the beach, pedalling trinkets, cigarettes or fake
designer goods.
Italy having been traditionally a country of emigration, 'the phenomenon of
seeing hundreds of thousands of Africans has become very evident for the
Italians all of a sudden', she explains.
Moreover, the numbers appeared out of control in a country which almost
anybody could enter without a permit. Although some control was
theoretically exercised by the ministry of the interior, there was 'nothing
planned at all', she says. 'And, you know, Italians are not particularly
talented in organisation.'
How will she cope with the new immigration law steered through parliament by
her Socialist colleague Mr Claudio Martelli?
'My first priority is to make the Martelli law work. That is an immense job
in itself, as it means co-ordinating about 12 other ministries, including
local government, the police, education and social services.'
They must join forces to establish the framework for dealing with the
250,000 immigrants who took advantage of the amnesty last year to legalise
their status.
Next comes the problem of longer-term resettlement, she says. Italian
communes have been no more willing to accept Africans and Albanians than the
small west German towns were willing to absorb thousands of east Europeans
as the Communist system collapsed.
Some 800 Albanians have been sent to Mrs Boniver's north Italian
constituency of Asti alone, causing immediate problems there, she says. 'You
can't expect local elected politicians to take on what is an extremely
unpopular task. They keep saying no.'
But while shifting responsibility for resettlement to regional, or even
national, level may take the heat off local politicians, it will not tackle
the root problem.
That involves setting further immigration quotas after the freeze during the
law's first year of operation, when immigrants taking advantage of the
amnesty were legalised and a further 50,000 expelled.
Setting next year's quota is 'one of my first priorities', she says. She
would like preference to be given to Italy's ex-colonies in Africa and to
neighbouring countries such as Albania which have Italian-speaking
communities.
But she admits that enforcing the country-by-country quotas will be all but
impossible given Italy's long coastline, relative proximity to Africa 'and
the fact that we are not a police state'. As a result, the number of illegal
immigrants, estimated at 300,000 even after the amnesty, is set to grow.
The Italians also face the additional threat posed by political instability
in neighbouring countries such as Yugoslavia and Albania. Even under the new
law, there is no visa requirement with Yugoslavia, which means the door is
open to huge inflows in the event of a crisis there.
According to Mrs Boniver, setting up the new ministry has already taken part
of the sting out of the immigration issue. Giving her responsibility for
looking after the interests of Italians abroad will further calm popular
sentiment, she thinks.
'If the new ministry had been just for immigration, it would have created a
lot of resentment' from people claiming that immigrants were getting some
sort of special treatment, she says. So establishing a joint function was
'very astute from a political point of view'.
Moreover, the big Italian communities in countries such as Brazil and
Argentina, which have traditionally come under the foreign ministry's wing,
have not always received enough attention in the past.
It will be her job to co-ordinate policies towards them and to improve the
flow of information to prevent them feeling 'abandoned'. While she stresses
she will give equal weight to both her new responsibilities, it is her
domestic task which is likely to be by far the more pressing.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Germany gives construction equipment lift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY IS likely to lead growth in the European construction equipment
market over the next few years, and could account for almost 30 per cent of
unit sales by 1995, according to a review by London-based Corporate
Intelligence Group (CIG).
The prediction underlines the impact of unification on the German market,
Europe's largest, which accounted for 18 per cent of European unit sales in
1989 and 24 per cent last year, when the five new states were included for
the first time.
'Europe is now a region of great contrasts; the UK and Scandinavian
countries are particularly weak, while the now unified Germany is showing a
buoyancy which nobody could have predicted two years ago,' says the study.
Equipment sales in Germany rose by 25 per cent last year from 19,275 units
in 1989 to 24,273, due to a long-awaited revival of the housing market. This
was caused by cyclical factors and the arrival of large numbers of people
from the former East Germany.
Demand was particularly strong for wheeled loaders and mini-excavators, but
the report singles out 'the gallant backhoe loader salesmen who, after years
of struggling in the west (of Germany) against wheeled excavators, went east
and struck gold - about 400 units sold.'
The study says infrastructural improvements in the east are bound to come
and the potential there is enormous. It forecasts a slight dip in units sold
this year in Germany, to 22,700, but predicts sales will reach 29,200 in
1995, out of a total for Europe of 104,692.
The picture is less bright elsewhere in Europe. Unit sales fell 5 per cent
last year to 100,775 and CIG believes they could be as low as 93,700 units
this year.
One reason for the decline is the enormous number of machines bought during
1987-89, leaving fleets relatively young, and more than sufficient for
current workloads.
Another factor, says the study, is the generally unhealthy economic climate
across Europe; inflation and interest rates have hit governments' spending
plans badly, and large projects have either been cancelled or postponed.
But the study believes 1991 will be a watershed year, and equipment demand
will start to firm up by the middle of 1992. This should set the tone to the
middle of the decade, by when demand should have almost recovered to 1989
levels.

FT  01 MAY 91 / VW agrees second joint venture in Czechoslovakia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN is to take an eventual 94 per cent stake in a small volume car
assembly and gearbox production venture with BAZ (Bratislavske Automobilove
Zavody), the Slovak automotive engineering group. It has already agreed to
take an eventual 70 per cent stake in the Czechoslovak car-maker Skoda for
DM1.4bn (Pounds 460m).
VW said the joint venture with BAZ would be named Volkswagen Bratislava. VW
will initially take an 80 per cent stake in the DM60m equity capital of the
new venture, the remainder to be owned by the Slovak government. It will
inject a further DM140m in 1992 and 1993.
VW plans to produce 30,000 cars a year (probably the Passat) from completely
knocked down kits from 1993. Until then it will make 3,000 a year from
semi-knocked down kits.
It will also establish a gearbox assembly line at BAZ with a capacity to
produce 1,300 units a day from 1994 for export to VW plants elsewhere.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Sunday trading may grow after appeal court ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of more stores opening on Sundays increased yesterday after a
court ruling threw doubt upon the enforceability of Sunday trading laws.
The Court of Appeal lifted injunctions banning B&amp;Q, the do-it-yourself
chain, and Wickes Building Supplies from opening stores in West Yorkshire
and Somerset on Sundays.
A lawyer for Kirklees Borough Council, one of the local authorities
involved, said after the hearing that the ruling made the Sunday trading
laws 'virtually unenforceable'.
Retailers were digesting implications of the decision last night. The
British Retailers' Association, representing the multiple chains, described
the decision as 'a further muddying of the legal water' and said it 'made it
all the more imperative for the government to grasp the nettle'.
Texas Homecare, the 230-store DIY chain owned by Ladbroke Group, said it
would open a further 20 stores on Sundays, bringing the total to about 200.
High Court injunctions were granted last May to Kirklees council forcing
Sunday closure on Wickes centres in Huddersfield and Dewsbury, West
Yorkshire, and to Mendip District Council in respect of a new B&amp;Q store at
Glastonbury, Somerset.
The Appeal Court said yesterday that neither local authority had been
willing to give undertakings that, if it eventually lost the case, it would
compensate the stores for any financial losses resulting from enforced
Sunday closure. The court ruled that, as a settled point of law, in the
absence of any such undertakings the injunctions should not have been
granted.
The maximum penalty for Sunday trading is a Pounds 1,000 fine, per store on
any one Sunday. This has not proved a sufficient deterrent to large chain
stores which can make as much as Pounds 500,000 profit a year per store from
Sunday trading. Local authorities have turned increasingly to injunctions
during the past 18 months as the only effective means of enforcing the law.
Mr David Ramsden, B&amp;Q's controller of retail services, called the decision a
'resounding victory'. Councils would have to think hard before risking
taxpayers' money on prosecutions.
Mr Roger Butterfield, senior solicitor for Kirklees, doubted if many local
authorities would give undertakings to back applications for injunctions
because of the enormous cost involved if they lost. 'This judgment has made
the Shops Act virtually unenforceable,' he said. The council has yet to
decide whether it will appeal.
Mr Bill Connor, deputy general secretary of Usdaw, the shopworkers trade
union, said the ruling was 'a technical victory for illegal Sunday traders'.
The union's annual conference passed a motion affirming its opposition to
reform of the act. Mr Connor said the act was 'all we have' to protect
workers from having their hours extended against their wishes.
B&amp;Q estimates that up to 100 stores are affected by injunctions banning them
from Sunday trading.
The company said it would be contacting local authorities involved to ask
them either to give undertakings or drop the injunctions.
The legality of the Sunday trading laws will be challenged by B&amp;Q in the
House of Lords next month. The group is appealing against a ruling by Mr
Justice Hoffmann in the High Court last July that the 1950 Shops Act does
not contravene free trade principles of European Community law.
The Law Lords may refer the issue to the European Court in Luxembourg, which
could prolong the uncertainty about the Sunday trading laws for another two
years.

FT  01 MAY 91 / CBI cautious about timing of economic recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, PETER NORMAN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTLOOK for UK manufacturers is improving but it is too early to talk of
a recovery, according to a survey published yesterday by the Confederation
of British Industry.
It paints a mixed picture of the prospects for the factory sector,
indicating that business confidence is still declining although at a slower
rate than during the early stages of the recession.
Manufacturers continue to believe that low demand will lead them to reduce
output over the next few months. But the number projecting a fall has fallen
substantially since the previous large CBI survey in January.
While order books, prospects for employment and the number of companies
working below capacity all point to a weak economy, the CBI said that the
results from the survey were compatible with the prospect of an economic
upturn in the second half of the year. It could not be more precise about
the timing.
The CBI survey is repeated every three months and is among the most widely
monitored indicators of future demand levels in the UK economy,
Manufacturing accounts for less than a quarter of UK output but the health
of many other sectors - including services - depends on it.
Publication of the survey sparked skirmishes among the main political
parties. It was seized on by ministers as support for their forecast that
the economy would begin to emerge from the recession during the second half
of the year.
However, as the campaigning for tomorrow's local elections entered its final
stages, Labour accused the Conservatives of wrecking manufacturing industry
with a 'classless recession'. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman,
said unemployment was hitting all sectors of the economy, all parts of the
country, and all types of workers.
The Liberal Democrats said the light for manufacturing was 'at the end of a
very long tunnel'.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said that business optimism was 'starting
to change dramatically' and that the economy would follow this trend.
In Washington for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings,
Mr Lamont admitted that the survey did not signal the end of the recession.
He said, however, that the outlook for exports and orders was 'improving
markedly' and the outlook for manufacturers' prices and inflation was
excellent.
One good piece of news for the government from the survey concerns
inflation. The poor demand in Britain means that fewer companies expect to
increase the prices of their goods for domestic sale than at any time for
the past 23 years.
The survey repeated the bleak tone of recent soundings about investment. The
CBI expects that capital spending in manufacturing industry will decline by
19 per cent between the third quarter of 1990 and the same period of this
year.

FT  01 MAY 91 / US discount rate cut as Fed eases monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Reserve yesterday moved to stimulate the flagging American
economy by unexpectedly easing monetary policy.
It cut the discount rate - the rate charged when banks borrow reserves
directly from the central bank - by half a percentage point to 5 1/2 per
cent and signalled a quarter point cut to 5.75 per cent in the federal funds
rate - the key short-term interest rate, which banks charge each other for
loans.
The cut in the discount rate, the third half-point reduction since December,
follows repeated calls from the White House for an easing of monetary policy
to combat the domestic recession. President George Bush, who has
unsuccessfully urged interest rate cuts in other industrialised economies,
praised the Fed for showing strong leadership. He said the move would
stimulate growth not only in the US but across the world.
The dollar lost more than 5 pfennigs in London to close at DM1.7170, while
against the pound it finished nearly 5 cents lower at Dollars 1.7240. In New
York it weakened further but ended above its day's lows at DM1.708 and
Dollars 1.7315.
The rate cut caught the ministers and central bank governors at the spring
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank by surprise. It
had not been discussed in Sunday's meeting of the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries or in Monday's session of the IMF's policy-making
Interim Committee.
Germany welcomed the action but made clear that there was no chance of
similar action by the Bundesbank.
Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, said the cut was good for British
recovery prospects. He added that UK interest rates would continue to be set
in accordance with the pound's position in the exchange rate mechanism of
the European Monetary System and the need to bear down on inflation.
However, the Fed action both reduced the attraction to international
investors of the dollar, which has shown persistent strength since February,
and raised the possibility of interest-rate cuts elsewhere.
Mr David Morrison, chief international economist at the London office of
Goldman Sachs, the US bank, said the move would help Italy, France and
Britain in particular. All three are keen to ease borrowing conditions as
part of their effort to bolster growth.
Cuts in the US prime rate are now likely. Yesterday Southwest Bank, a small
St Louis bank that has led industry moves in the past, took the plunge,
cutting its prime rate from 9 per cent to 8 3/4 per cent.
The Fed's move came on a 4-1 vote of the governors with Governor Wayne
Angell casting the dissenting vote. The cut follows a vigorous internal
debate about policy with some regional presidents and governors expressing
concern about the inflation outlook.
The Fed said action was taken 'in the light of continued weakness in
economic activity, especially in the industrial and capital goods areas, and
evidence of abating inflationary pressures'. It added that the reduction in
part realigned the discount rate with market interest rates.
The easing of policy follows a spate of poor economic statistics. The
Commerce Department said factory orders had fallen by 2.8 per cent in March
and durable goods orders by 6 per cent. Real GNP contracted at an annual
rate of 2.8 per cent in the first quarter, a steeper decline than
anticipated by the White House.
Early indicators for April are not encouraging. The Conference Board, a
business group based in New York, said its index of consumer confidence,
fell slightly in April after a big rise in March. Surveys show consumers
more depressed about current conditions but relatively sanguine about
longer-term trends.

FT  01 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Falls trimmed by US interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON equities slipped lower yesterday in lacklustre trading, taking only
marginal comfort from an unexpected cut in US interest rates. A survey from
the Confederation of British Industry served to remind fund managers that it
is still too soon to call the bottom of the recession. Investors saw no
reason to commit themselves ahead of the UK local government elections being
held tomorrow.
The overnight fall on Wall Street led to an uninspired start to trading in
London. The dollar reversed its trend of recent days, falling a steep five
cents against sterling by the end of the session. This had the predictable
effect of weakening international stocks, whose strength had been behind
much of the previous day's market rise. Since the sector includes some of
the highest capitalisation issues in the market, the falls had a large
effect on the Footsie index.
Traders looking for a guide to sentiment found little help in the latest
Confederation of British Industry monthly survey of industrial trends.
On the one hand, the CBI confirmed that fewer UK manufacturers see output
declining in the coming months. Mr Richard Kersley at BZW said that in
previous recessions such a turning point in output forecasts indicated that
company earnings would begin to recover about six months later.
But investment plans continued to be delayed. This suggests that engineering
and capital goods companies might be left out of any third quarter earnings
recovery. Mr Kersley said that this again was to be expected; capital goods
earnings tended to be a lagging indicator in the economic cycle.
He warned that investors should be wary of optimistic interpretations of the
CBI survey, saying that new orders in the last few months had been so weak
that some hopes for recovery were based on the view that 'things cannot
continue this badly'.
The expiry of the April future contract yesterday failed to lift prices, in
spite of the efforts of at least one securities house to support the Footsie
index. In this atmosphere of uncertainty the Footsie index reached its low
point for the day of 2,475.6 just before Wall Street opened. The half
percentage point cut in the US discount rate, to 5 1/2 per cent, coincided
with the start of trading in New York.
'There seems to have been a tacit deal with the Bundesbank (at last
weekend's G7 meeting),' said Mr Robin Gilbert at Schroders. He thought that
as a result it was now unlikely that the Bundesbank would increase its
interest rates at its fortnightly meeting tomorrow.
The consequent sharp opening rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
however, produced only a muted response in London. The Footsie recovered to
2,486.2, still a fall of 12 on the day. Turnover, at 413.9m shares, was only
a little higher than the previous day's dismal levels of business. Mr
Richard Lake, a chartist at Hoare Govett, said the London stock market would
continued to languish. His trigger for a rally is a level on the Footsie of
2,450.
Among individual stocks. Coats Viyella's increased offer for Tootal had been
well signalled in the press. The steady stream of rights issues continued.
Clothing and engineering group William Baird called for Pounds 39m in a
one-for-five issue. As if to underscore the CBI survey, and the market's
mood, Baird accompanied its cash call with a warning that trading conditions
would remain difficult in the short term.

FT  01 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXPECTED squeeze in the equity futures market ahead of the expiry of the
April FT-SE 100 index options contract failed to materialise yesterday.
Instead, the market remained on the defensive as Wall Street reacted with a
distinct lack of enthusiasm to the reduction in US interest rates.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd was said to be short of April 2,500 FT-SE puts before
the options expiry. But when the futures market failed to hold above 2,500,
it was forced to try to buy back puts and hedge itself by selling the
futures market.
So by the time of the expiry of the April options, the Footsie futures' lead
over the cash index had been whittled away to just 10 points, which
depressed the stock market.
This was reflected in the options market turnover figures, which showed the
FT-SE contracts accounting for over 9,000 lots or a third of the day's
business. FT-SE options normally make up just under a quarter of daily
turnover.
The June FT-SE future closed at 2,509, down 12 points. Its premium to the
spot FT-SE index ended at 26 points, compared with 22 at the previous close
and fair value of 15.
British Gas options were heavily traded on news of its agreement to tough
controls on price rises. Investors sold puts and calls. The June 260 calls
had 1,900 lots traded.

FT  01 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): News of US rate cut lifts
Continent late in the day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CUT in US interest rates and the firm opening on Wall Street lifted the
Continent yesterday near the end of a generally lacklustre session. Most
bourses will be closed today for the May Day holiday. Amsterdam was shut
yesterday for the Queen's Birthday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw some buying of blue chips at the lower levels, but in general
trading was lacklustre as dealers unwound their positions before today's
holiday. Prices were marked up in the post-bourse, however, after the US
Federal Reserve cut the discount rate.
At the close, the DAX index fell 14.49 to 1,605.79 while the FAZ index,
calculated at midsession, declined 9.52 to 680.76. Volume shrank to DM4.1bn
from DM5.9bn.
Strikes by the IG Metall metal workers' union to press for higher wages
depressed the car sector. Daimler lost DM9 to DM698 while Volkswagen fell
DM4.70 to DM371.
Deutsche Bank fell DM5.70 to DM643.80. The bank said that it would ask
shareholders to approve a DM75m rise in authorised capital to be used for
placement in the US prior to the stock's listing on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Continental, the tyre manufacturer, fell DM4.50 to DM211.50 before Friday's
supervisory board meeting, at which Pirelli is expected to seek two board
seats to reflect its shareholding in the German company.
MILAN concentrated on shares linked to the Mondadori publishing group,
following an accord late on Monday between Mr Carlo De Benedetti and Mr
Silvio Berlusconi to divide its assets.
Mondadori savings shares were suspended briefly because of excessive demand.
They closed at L12,900, up L1,300 or 11.2 per cent. The magazine L'Espresso
soared L1,800 or 8.6 per cent to L22,800. Cir, Mr De Benedetti's holding
company, closed up L50 at L2,600.
Trading was estimated at close to Monday's thin L131bn. The MIB index rose
one point to 1,121; the Comit index was unavailable.
PARIS finished only slightly above its session low in a session dominated by
index-related business as futures and options contracts expired. Half of the
total turnover of about FFr2.1bn was said to have been index-related, and to
have taken place in the last hour of trading. The CAC 40 index touched a low
of 1,772.51 before closing 18.17 or 1 per cent down at 1,779.18.
Among the CAC 40 stocks, UAP, the insurer which held an analysts' meeting on
Monday, dropped FFr23 or 4.1 per cent to FFr540 with 113,550 shares
exchanged; and L'Oreal fell FFr15 or 2.7 per cent to FFr547. Michelin
continued to rise in active trading, adding another 70 centimes to FFr95.10
on 680,550 shares.
CGI Informatique, the software company, lost FFr14.80 or 4.3 per cent to
FFr333.20 after its figures disappointed analysts at the previous day's
meeting.
Suez eased FFr2.10 to FFr337.90 on 197,150 shares. The financial holding
company said that it would convert its investment certificates, which have
been suspended at FFr300, into ordinary shares.
BRUSSELS recouped part of its early losses as Wall Street opened higher. The
Bel20 index ended 10.64 lower at 1,188.35 in turnover of BFr1.2bn.
US-related stocks showed the strongest recovery: retailer Delhaize bounced
back from a low of BFr7,530 to close at BFr7,670, down BFr140.
MADRID reduced its morning losses, as the general index ended 0.73 lower at
275.74. Hidrola fell Pta11 to Pta556 in heavy volume of 957,686 shares,
while Iberduero, which is expected to merge with Hidrola, gained Pta5 to
Pta714 on 1.04m shares.
ZURICH ended above its day's low, as the Credit Suisse index closed at
549.6, down 1.2. Trading was thin before today's holiday.
STOCKHOLM drifted lower in a shortened session ahead of the May Day holiday.
The Affarsvarlden General index fell 5.7 to 1,046.2 in volume of SKr213m
after Monday's SKr188m.
OSLO closed mostly lower, as the news of the US interest rate cut came after
the close. The all-share index dropped 2.47 to 479.09 in moderate turnover
of NKr388m. Norsk Hydro shed NKr3 to NKr182 and Saga Petroleum free shares
also lost NKr3, closing at NKr105.
ISTANBUL dropped another 6 per cent as economic worries grew. The 75-share
index, which fell 6.4 per cent on Monday, lost 225.61 to 3,554.25.

FT  01 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei ends little
changed as volume falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS returned yesterday after Monday's holiday but few were eager to
trade, and share prices drifted to close with an easier bias, writes Seth
Sulkin in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 12.43 at 26,111.25 as volume fell to 230m shares
from Friday's 300m. The index set a low for the day of 26,094.09 and a high
of 26,258.61. Declines narrowly led advances by 490 to 453, with 180
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks improved 5.46 to
1,963.42, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 13.85 to 1,499.01.
The extension of afternoon trading hours came into operation yesterday. The
market now reopens at 12.30 pm, instead of 1 pm. Dealers hope the longer
hours will attract more customer orders, but said the initial effect was
difficult to gauge because of the Golden Week holiday. The market will close
on Friday and Monday.
Share prices were higher in the morning on futures-related buying and upward
revised earnings by several companies, but interest rate uncertainty kept a
lid on gains. At the Group of Seven meeting in Washington, US President
George Bush called for lower worldwide interest rates, but dealers said
there was no reason to assume that the Bank of Japan would loosen its
monetary policy.
Bond prices closed at the session's lows, pushing equities down. Mr Matthew
Berlow, economist with Credit Lyonnais, said the Finance Ministry had not
put pressure on the Bank of Japan to cut interest rates, even though money
supply growth had fallen significantly this year.
Among shares lifted by revised earnings forecasts was Nippon Densetsu Kogyo,
which climbed Y170 or almost 10 per cent to a record Y1,900. Traders said
the electrical engineering company, which is heavily involved in the
railroad industry, was also boosted by reports of more investment from
leading rail companies.
Large-capital issues were mixed. Nippon Steel, the day's volume leader,
eased Y2 to Y471. Kobe Steel, also heavily traded, firmed Y5 to Y545.
The prominence of environmental issues prompted buying in related companies.
Takuma, a boiler maker which has diversified into rubbish disposal and water
treatment, advanced Y140, almost 10 per cent, to Y1,280.
Sodick, a numerical control machine tool maker listed on the second section,
rose Y170 to Y2,510. Keiyo, a do-it-yourself chain store operator often
targeted by speculators, gained Y190 to Y3,400.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 30.09 to 28,782.30 on volume of 19m
shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets were mostly depressed by Wall Street's overnight
weakness, although there was bargain hunting on some exchanges.
AUSTRALIA fell 1.5 per cent as the strong overseas interest of recent
sessions evaporated. The All Ordinaries index shed 24.1 to 1,534.2 in
turnover of ADollars 289m, against ADollars 259m.
NEW ZEALAND declined in moderate trading, the Barclays index losing 19.25 or
1.3 per cent to 1,467.86 as turnover eased to NZDollars 20m from NZDollars
23m. Brierley Investments weakened 6 cents to NZDollars 1.03 on heavy volume
of 2m shares.
HONG KONG reversed an early rise, with late selling testing the 3,600
support level for the Hang Seng index, which ended down 36.36 or 1 per cent
at 3,588.36. Turnover totalled HKDollars 1.07bn (HKDollars 1.02bn).
SINGAPORE hit a nine-month high before closing lower in light trading. The
Straits Times Industrial index reached 1,566.75, its best level since July
last year, but ended a net 4.7 off at 1,553.94 in volume of 65.6m shares
(64.6m).
TAIWAN staged a sharp rebound on bargain hunting after the previous
session's steep fall. The weighted index rose 193.29 or 3.4 per cent to
5,921.29 in turnover of TDollars 64.5bn, down from TDollars 106bn.
MANILA attracted bargain hunting after recent weakness. The composite index
gained 23.97 or 2.3 per cent to 1,057.53. A block sale of 563,783 shares of
Bank of Philippine Islands at 580 pesos each - against Monday's closing
price of 530 pesos - boosted overall turnover to 444m pesos from 91m.

FT  01 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets: Spain's economic growth attracts
foreign investors - But shareholder protection remains a subject of concern
and some confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACQUELINE MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investors are not fully convinced by the reforms of the Madrid stock
market, but Spain, with one of the faster growing economies of Europe,
continues to attract international interest.
The Spanish market is Europe's best performer so far this year, according to
the FT-Actuaries World Indices, having risen 23 per cent in local currency
terms compared with a gain of 16 per cent for Europe as a whole. The growth
in Spanish gross domestic product is expected to slow down this year, but
still exceed the European average, according to Mr Pedro Perez, secretary of
state for the economy - a prediction that appeals to international fund
managers.
Some of the attempts to reform the stock market inspire less confidence.
Investor protection, particularly regarding takeovers and mergers, remains a
subject of concern and of some confusion to foreign investors.
As Mr Luis Carlos Croissier, chairman of the Stock Exchange Commission, said
at a recent seminar in Madrid held by Spanish brokers FG, mergers are not
covered by takeover regulations. Moreover, he added that if a potential
takeover situation occurs as the result of the restructuring of an
economically important sector, the government has the power to waive the
takeover regulations.
This can put minority shareholders in a difficult position, as they find
their shares in independent companies turn into part of a vast
state-controlled conglomerate. An example is Catalana de Gas, the country's
biggest gas distributor, which merged last year with the gas interests of
Repsol, the state-controlled oil group.
This could also happen to investors hoping to benefit from the
reorganisation of the electrical utility sector, says Mr Paul Farrow, head
of research at FG. Investors speculating on takeovers could lose out if the
government decides to treat the takeovers as mergers, as the purchaser
company would not need to offer shareholders a premium to the share price.
Nevertheless, Mr Croissier says that the bolsa has made progress in
increasing transparency, liquidity and investor protection. And foreign
interest does seem to be growing. Ms Massoumeh Khadjenouri of Shearson
Lehman Global Asset Management says that about 12 per cent of the company's
three European funds - worth Dollars 30m, Dollars 20m and Dollars 5m - is
invested in Spain. This compares with a weighting of 4.3 per cent in the
FT-Actuaries Europe Index.
Although positive on the market's outlook for the next six to nine months,
she is cautious in the short term because of the market's recent strength.
She expects to reduce the fund's weighting in Spain towards the end of the
year.
Other fund managers are less enthusiastic. Mr Dino Fuschillo of Lazard
Investors says he is only mildly positive about the Spanish market, pointing
out that it is no longer in the runaway situation of 1985 and 1986. Lazard
has Pounds 300m (Dollars 503m) invested in Europe out of total funds under
discretionary management of Pounds 3bn, and has Spain on a neutral
weighting.
Mr Fuschillo believes there are some above-average growth opportunities,
mainly in the banks and utilities, but that cyclical stocks have bounced too
high since the end of the Gulf war. He is cautious about the country's
economic prospects, but adds that some investors pay too much attention to
the prospect of rising inflation.
Most fund managers take a medium-term view of the market. Mr Ignacio Gomez
Montejo, chief strategist at FG, argues that an even longer term view is
appropriate, even though most foreign investors hold on to their shares for
an average of only 15 months.
On a 10-year view, there are three possible strategies for international
investors, says Mr Gomez Montejo:
picking companies most likely to benefit from a single European market, such
as Acerinox, the stainless steel producer, Viscofan, the food wrappings
concern, and Banco Santander - a strategy that carries the highest risks but
could also be the most profitable;
arbitrage between European markets, based on a few macroeconomic indicators;
and picking potential takeover candidates.
One disadvantage for investors is that many of the more interesting
companies are not listed on the stock market, says Mr Gomez Montejo,
although it is possible to buy funds which invest in these companies. Two or
three are already in operation and more are expected to be launched.
Although international investors still have reservations about shareholder
protection, FG predicts that by the year 2000 foreigners will own one fifth
of the total market.

FT  01 MAY 91 / Money Markets: London rates ease
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST RATES declined on the London money market and prices of short
sterling futures rose on Liffe after the US Federal Reserve cut its discount
rate by  1/2 point to 5 1/2 per cent.
The mood was already optimistic about a cut in UK bank base rates and the
Fed's move encouraged a further easing of wholesale rates.
Three-month sterling interbank fell to 11 3/4 -11 5/8 from 11 13/16 -11 per
cent, while 12-month money declined to 11 5/16 -11 1/4 from 11 11/32 -11
5/16 per cent.
On Liffe short sterling for June delivery opened little changed at 88.76 and
touched a peak of 88.84 before closing at 88.83 compared with 88.75
previously.
Last night's settlement price discounts a three-month offered rate of about
11 3/16 at delivery compared with the present cash rate of 11 3/4 per cent.
The Bank of England supplied more than enough help to take out the full
underlying credit shortage on the money market, but kept the short end tight
by leaving most of the assistance until the end of the day.
A day-to-day shortage of Pounds 750m was initially forecast, but this was
revised to Pounds 700m at noon and back to Pounds 750m in the afternoon.
Total assistance of Pounds 797m was provided.
Before lunch the authorities bought Pounds 45m bills outright, by way of
Pounds 2m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 43m bank bills
in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon another Pounds 642m bills
were purchased, via Pounds 151m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and
Pounds 491m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Late assistance of
around Pounds 110m was also provided.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 1,276m. This outweighed exchequer
transactions adding Pounds 445m to liquidity, a fall in the note circulation
of Pounds 50m and bank balances above target of Pounds 30m.
In Frankfurt call money remained around 8.95 per cent as banks scrambled for
funds to increase their reserve holdings on the last day of the month. This
followed the Bundesbank's move to drain a net DM4.9bn at this week's
securities repurchase agreement tender.
The central bank accepted bids totalling DM40.4bn at a two-tranche tender,
against expiring pacts of DM45.3bn. It provided DM29.5bn of 34-day funds at
a fixed rate of 8.60 per cent and DM10.9bn of 62-day money at variable
rates, mostly around 8.90 per cent.
