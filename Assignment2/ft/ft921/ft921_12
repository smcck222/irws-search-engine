FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Comment): Caring moves at the bottom of the
ladder - John Willman on help for those with low incomes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last budget before the general election has been used to make two points
about Mr John Major's approach to social policy.
The first point is that he is prepared to devote resources to helping people
who are at the bottom of the income ladder - in contrast to his predecessor.
The most obvious indicator of this is the introduction of a reduced rate of
income tax for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income.
The cost of the new 20 per cent tax band will be Pounds 1.8bn in 1992-93,
rising to Pounds 2.3bn in the following year - but three-quarters of the
Pounds 1.8bn cost will go to people earning less than average male earnings.
This allows the chancellor to point out to those on below-average income
that much of the benefit goes to them. At the same time, he can sell the
reduced rate band to the better-off as the first instalment of a cut in the
basic rate of tax from 25 per cent to 20 per cent.
It will also be hard for Labour to argue against the reduced rate band -
until quite recently, the party was committed to introducing at least one
lower-rate tax band itself. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, has been
quoted in the past as saying that he regarded a 25 per cent marginal tax
rate for those earning just above the tax-free allowances was far too high.
At least as significant in demonstrating Mr Major's more compassionate
approach in the run-up to the election are the increases in income support
announced for pensioners: Pounds 2 a week for single pensioners, Pounds 3 a
week for couples. At least 5m less well-off pensioners will gain something
from the increase - half through rises in related means-tested benefits such
as housing benefit and community charge benefit.
The increases announced in the Budget come on top of rises announced last
October as part of the annual uprating of social security benefits and
allowed the chancellor to claim that by next October, the full income
support rates for pensioners would have been increased by between Pounds
5.75 a week and Pounds 10.70 a week in total.
The government will contrast these figures with the increases in the
flat-rate state pension which Labour has promised to all pensioners of
Pounds 5 a week for single people and Pounds 8 a week for couples.
Of course the government's totals include the indexation element of last
October's uprating - Labour's increases would be on top of that. And only
pensioners on income support get anything out of these rises - the
increasing proportion who do not need to rely on means-tested benefits will
get nothing from higher income support.
But that in turn allows the government to make a second point about its more
compassionate approach: that while the Conservatives are prepared to be help
the needy, they are hard-headed in how they do it. The Conservative approach
is to be selective rather than universal, to target help to those who need
it, not spray it around willy-nilly.
As the chancellor pointed out in yesterday's Budget speech, pensioners are
increasingly well-off, as entitlement builds up to occupational pensions and
the state earnings-related pensions scheme.
'On average, pensioners' real income increased by more than a third between
1979 and 1988,' Mr Lamont pointed out. 'More than half of pensioners now
have a second pension; and pensioners have seen their income from saving
double since 1979.'
The proportion of pensioners who depend only or mainly on the basic
flat-rate state pension is falling. By promising to increase the flat-rate
pension substantially to help this declining group, Labour must also find
the resources to pay the same increase to pensioners for whom the flat-rate
pension is relatively unimportant.
This makes Labour's promise expensive one - it would cost Pounds 2.9bn, and
to pay for it, Labour must increase tax and national insurance contributions
for people earning much over Pounds 20,000 a year. Yesterday's increase for
pensioners on income support, in contrast, will cost no more than Pounds
305m in a full year.
The benefits of such targeting are emphasised by the chancellor's statement
that the increase will be paid for out of reserves. The cost is so small
that it need have no consequences for public expenditure - never mind
require a tax increase.
Whether this will impress pensioners remains to be seen. Many of the 5m
pensioners to benefit from yesterday's rise will get less than the full
increases: dividing the Pounds 305m between them means that the average
increase is Pounds 61 a year (Pounds 1.17 a week).
And there are many pensioners whose incomes are too high to qualify for
income support and other means-tested benefits who would not see themselves
as well-off. They may well reflect that Labour's extra Pounds 5 a week for
singles, Pounds 8 a week for couples would be a prize worth having.
But the increase for pensioners on income support will undoubtedly be
deployed by the Conservatives in ways which attempt to neutralise Labour's
appeal to pensioners - while portraying the government as one which can
afford to be generous to the most needy while being prudent with scarce
resources.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Comment): Modestly in the wrong direction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When I hear Norman Lamont's very close supporters streaming out of the
galleries, saying what a politically clever Budget it was, my natural
suspicions are aroused. When I hear a more Thatcherite ex-minister saying it
was not too big a give-away, I flee to have another look at the arithmetic.
And when I hear a former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, now
the chancellor's personal adviser, admit that the new Pounds 2,000 20 per
cent band of income tax is just the proposal that the IFS had always
denounced when it came from the Labour Party as an ineffective way of
helping the poor, compared with increasing the thresholds, I suspect it is
not my sort of Budget.
One of Sir Geoffrey Howe's early acts as chancellor was to get rid of
Labour's lower rate band.
'Only modestly in the wrong direction' is the norm for democratic
politicians and is likely to be the shape of policy in the 1990s in most
countries.
The political cleverness presumably lies in the challenge to Labour to
repeal a measure very much in its own image. Promising to enact the whole
Labour manifesto would have been cleverer still.
The Budget is much more likely to be remembered by the undertaking to
replace the whole strange British Budget ritual by a proper Budget in
December, announcing public expenditure and tax decisions together. The
reform programme previously on the table - that of the Armstrong Committee
which reported in 1980 - had in mind a Green Budget in the autumn followed
by the normal Budget in March. The danger was that the period in between
would be open season for every pressure group to push for more spending or
special interest tax concessions. That may have been eliminated by retaining
a single Budget day. The main drawback is that the chancellor would have to
finalise his tax decisions more than three months before the beginning of
the financial year. Finance ministers in other countries survive with a
greater gap than that.
Now for the Budget numbers. The biggest shock horror figure is not the
chancellor's reliefs which amount to 'only' Pounds 2.6bn in a full year,
less than half a per cent of GDP. What is that between friends? It is rather
the total public sector borrowing requirement. Here again the figure to look
at is not the headline Pounds 28bn for the coming financial year, but the
Pounds 32bn (4 3/4 per cent of GDP) projected for 1993-94, when - if the
Budget Red Book is to be believed - the economy will be two years into
recovery.
The accompanying chart shows that the envisaged deficits are higher, even as
a percentage of GDP, than they were in the Thatcher recession, even though
the Budget Red Book chart expects the present recession to be shallower and
shorter.
As far as it has gone, the deterioration in the public finances has not been
disastrous. The Red Book shows the public sector debt ratio levelling off in
the mid-1990s at just under 35 per cent, which would be well short of a debt
trap in which the government had to borrow more and more simply to pay the
interest on past deficits. But the reassurance does depend on public
spending moving back to a modest path and real GDP going back to the trend
of the 1980s.
The trouble is that the route to an Italian-type fiscal problem is not
through one large doctrinal misjudgment, but through a series of modest
lapses, guided by wishful thinking. What can happen is illustrated in a very
honest table (2B. 2) in the Red Book, which shows a deterioration of Pounds
25bn in the PSBR for both 1993-94 and 1994-95, compared with the projections
made as recently as one year ago. As more than half the deterioration is on
the expenditure side, it is difficult to attribute it all to recession.
The Budget speech seemed to contain vestigial remnants of two alternative
treatments which had been rejected. One was a throw-away reference to public
sector investment of Pounds 30bn, the largest of the many possible
definitions canvassed recently in the Treasury Bulletin. But if the
Chancellor wants to unpack the expenditure side, he has also to unpack the
revenue side and deal with capital receipts from privatisation, council
house sales and even inheritance tax. We are a long way from a proper public
sector capital account.
The other rejected alternative came much earlier in the speech when Mr
Lamont emphasised how useful the Maastricht framework was, irrespective of
whether the UK adopted a single currency or not. It seemed for a moment that
he would switch to the Maastricht budget deficit limit of 3 per cent of GDP.
But in the end he veered back to the established objective of 'a balanced
Budget over the economic cycle' - on the achievement of which I would not
stake my life's savings.
The fiscal risks are a European-wide phenomenon. The existence of a single
liberalised capital market and much diminished currency risk means that any
one government will find that it can borrow quite a lot without pushing up
rates of interest against itself. But the totality of European-wide
borrowing could increase the burdens on the planned European Central Bank,
raise European real interest rates, and make for instability against
currencies such as the dollar and the yen. No wonder the Bundesbank wants to
see the fiscal side tied up before it comes on side.
But if the fiscal prospect errs towards excessive borrowing, the monetary
position risks being too tight. There is another very striking chart showing
both broad money growth and bank and building society lending diving to a
growth rate of little more than 5 per cent, compared with around 15 per cent
in the mid-1980s. This is far from 'deflation', but still worrying.
I take a middle view between the technical monetarists, who shout 'woe, woe,
woe' and mainstream forecasters who carry on predicting recovery, which they
simply project forward when it fails to occur. For despite all
disappointments, the Treasury sees growth resuming at around 1 per cent in
the first half of 1992, and gathering pace to reach 3 per cent in a year's
time.
The monetary numbers are a warning that the official forecasters could go
wrong yet again, not a sure-fire prediction. If consumer and business
borrowers decide that they have reduced their debts enough, and there were a
return of animal spirits, the economy would pick up and the monetary numbers
with it.
One of Friedrich Hayek's seminal papers was entitled 'The Pretence of
Knowledge'; and this is what both mainstream forecasters and their ferocious
monetarist critics find difficult to avoid. The Red Book comes close to
admitting it when its authors write: 'The rise in the debt-income ratio in
the late-1982 was unprecedented, and past relationships provide little guide
to how far consumers might now want to retrench.' Why not then publish a
report on what is happening with an analysis of risks instead of a
conventional forecast?
What I always find most interesting about the Budget documents is not the
crystal gazing, but the analysis of recent history. In chart after chart,
the UK's remarkable success in reducing inflation to the German level
emerges, coupled with the narrowing of the UK-German interest rate
differential.
Another success sign is the unmistakable way in which the British share of
world trade in manufacturing, after decades of falling, has levelled off, or
even slightly risen, in the last nine years or so. Meanwhile UK price and
cost competitiveness, after a couple of years of deterioration, have now
recovered to the mid-1980s level.
The ERM link was not logically the only way of bringing down UK inflation
and keeping it there. But it is one that seems to be working. It would be
foolish to cast it aside because of a fatalistic belief that German interest
rates will never come down, and that the UK cannot recover without a
unilateral slashing of rates.
It is surely better to hold on to, and lock in, the anti-inflationary gains,
as Mrs Thatcher did not do in the mid-1980s, than to throw them away because
of a horrified refusal to see western Europe as a single monetary zone, or
to frighten oneself with projected balance of payments deficits just at a
time when the Central Statistical Office has slashed the actual recorded
deficit for last year by a quarter.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Comment): Industry receives a selective shot in
the arm - Charles Leadbeater assesses whether the Budget will help raise
British business from the depths of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the chief executive of a small business in the car industry facing a
huge rates bill, who has a sideline investing in British films, an offshoot
making cider and a brother who is a bookmaker, yesterday brought a stream of
good news.
All these groups of businesses benefitted from Mr Lamont's Budget. But for
much of the rest of industry the direct impact was neutral. It will give
them little help in emerging from the current recession.
It is unlikely that the budget measures designed to benefit all businesses,
such as the cut in the uniform business rate, will deliver a significant
early boost to capital investment. According to Mr Ron Garrick, chief
executive of the Weir Group the Scottish engineering concern, the business
rate cut would amount to only 0.25 per cent of his company's costs.
The Treasury forecasts that business investment will fall by 2.75 per cent
this year after a fall of 11.75 per cent last year.
What really matters to business is the impact the budget has upon the
political outlook. Most executives agree with the chancellor's assessment
that most of the ingredients of recovery from recession are in place in the
UK - principally lower inflation, healthier personal finances and lower
interest rates.
The Treasury forecasts that in the next year, these improving economic
indicators will be reflected in company finances. The corporate sector
financial deficit, the gap between its savings and its investment, should
close to less than 0.25 per cent of GDP this year and disappear altogether
next year. The real rate of return industrial companies receive should rise
from a trough of about 6 per cent last year to reach 8 per cent next year.
But many industrialists believe the recovery which should bring this
improvement in corporate finances is being held back by uncertainty among
consumers over the timing and outcome of the election.
The budget should improve business confidence, if it paves the way for the
election to be called and a Tory victory. Many businessmen were impressed by
the cleverness of Mr Lamont's creation of a 20p income tax band for the
first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income.
As one engineering group executive put it: 'If we can get the election out
of the way we can get on with doing some business.'
The general assessment among businessmen was that although Mr Lamont had
improved the Tories' chances the outcome of the election was still in the
balance.
The two most striking packages of business measures were delivered with
clear political messages.
This was a budget designed to help repair the government's relations with
small businesses, many of them in the recession-hit south east.
They will be the main beneficiaries of cuts in business rates (which will
affect about 500,000 businesses in England and Wales); the aboliton of
inheritance tax for family business; a reduction in the threshold at which
value added tax is paid and measures to make large companies pay their bills
more quickly. Small business organisations responded enthusiastically.
By contrast, large businesses got very little. They will benefit from last
year's decision to reduce corporation tax to 33 per cent. They will be
pleased that full VAT returns will have to be made quarterly rather than
monthly, hence saving administrative costs. But these gains trifle in
comparison with what large companies did not get.
A campaign by large international businesses to ease their advanced
corporation tax burden won them no more than an assurance that it would be
dealt with in future. They will be required to publish in their annual
reports how long they take to pay their small suppliers. One of the main
reasons the chancellor ruled out capital allowances to boost investment was
that they would disproportionately benefit big companies. A move to close a
tax loophole involving the way companies in part of the same group account
for property rent will mainly hit large conglomerates.
The other main business beneficiary should be the car industry, which
reacted gleefully to a raft of tax changes. These included a halving of car
tax, and a 50 per cent increase - to Pounds 12,000 - of the value of a
business car which can be claimed as a capital allowance.
Retailers and car manufacturers who deal more with private rather than
corporate sales should particularly benefit. Mr Lamont has made it easier
for companies to give employees cash to buy their own cars rather than take
fleet cars. The corporate sector will probably get about 60 per cent of the
Pounds 635m which the reduction in car tax will cost the exchequer. However
this has to be set against the Pounds 750m a year bill it could be facing
from this June from the introduction of national insurance contributions on
company cars.
General retailers who were shocked by last year's large increase in VAT to
help to pay for reform of the poll tax will be relieved that Mr Lamont said
there would be no further increase or extension of its scope. Retailers with
main beneficiaires among large companies from the cut in business rates.
However, the high street will remain a fairly glum place. The Treasury
predicts a slow and uncertain recovery in consumer spending despite the
income tax cuts.
The construction industry will be even more aggrieved. The official forecast
is that investment in private dwellings will fall by 1.75 per cent this year
and the housing market will remain weak. Construction companies delivered
the most negative response to the Budget. Mr Robert Napier, managing
director of Redland, the building material group summed it up: 'Construction
output is forecast to fall by up to 6 per cent this year. The budget has
done nothing to alleviate that.'
Sectors of manufacturing industry which have been forced into radical
restructuring by the recession, such as basic metal working and mechanical
engineering, were also dissatisfied. Machine tool manufacturers which have
seen new orders fall by between 30 per cent and 60 per cent were
disappointed there were no specific measures to stimulate manufacturing
investment.
Yet beneath the detail and beyond the immediate political priorities of the
budget, Mr Lamont delivered another message which business should listen to
carefully. Recovery from recession will be gradual partly because British
economic policy and performance is so hemmed in by international
constraints.
As Mr John Hudson, chief executive of Wagon Industrial, the Telford based
engineering group, put it: 'The basic message is that with European
economies so integrated no British government can on its own pull the
economy out of recession. There are no more quick fixes.'

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Comment): Adieu to monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Monetary policy is primarily directed at the maintenance of sterling's
parity within the exchange rate mechanism.'
With 15 of these 16 unexciting words the chancellor yesterday confirmed
officially what has been obvious for some time - that the government has
largely abandoned monetary policy as a response to domestic conditions. UK
interest rates are now set mainly in Europe, and that means Frankfurt.
It is true that the chancellor's 16th word, 'primarily', offers a saving
clause. So far as they are willing to support sterling from the reserves,
the authorities can allow rates to ease to a point which runs mild risks
with the exchange markets. Indeed, in recent weeks an average of about
Dollars 10m a day has been spent to avoid following German rates up. That,
however, is hardly what Mrs Thatcher would have called monetary sovereignty.
It is true, too, that 'in common with all the major countries within the
ERM', Mr Lamont did set a domestic monetary target; but it seems to have no
practical meaning. Mr Nigel Lawson introduced the M0 target mainly because,
unlike broader measures of money, it is quite a good short-term indicator,
and tends not to misbehave. Indeed, no policy action has ever been taken to
bring M0 under control or boost it.
Mr Lawson was, in fact, stealthily claiming a free hand in monetary policy.
Mr Lamont is using the same device to disguise the fact that he has almost
no freedom. Similarly, he said that he would 'closely watch' the more
traditional broad measures of money, and the trend of asset prices; but he
did not indicate any action that he might take. The record suggests it is
purely a spectator sport.
This busy tax reformer seems bored with monetary policy. It is as if he had
overlooked it until someone muttered the words of the drill sergeant
watching his troops heading for oblivion: 'Say something, sir - even if it's
only goodbye.'

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Small blessings welcomed - Charities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARITY leaders were last night counting small Budget blessings while
voicing disappointment that the government had not addressed the sector's
bigger problems.
The decision to reduce the level at which Gift Aid donations qualify for tax
relief from Pounds 600 to Pounds 400 will be widely welcomed. Gift Aid,
under which large one-off donations by individuals or companies qualify for
tax relief, was introduced in October 1990. By the end of 1991 charities had
claimed tax repayments of Pounds 50m on gifts of Pounds 150m.
Many charities have pressed for a reduction in the minimum donation, and the
chancellor's decision to set it at Pounds 400 will help to widen Gift Aid's
appeal.
However, charity directors were last night contrasting the sector's Pounds
50m gain in Gift Aid tax relief with its annual Pounds 250m losses in VAT.
The increase in the basic VAT rate last year hit charities badly, and the
voluntary sector has been lobbying the government throughout the past 12
months for remedial action.
Although the sector had not expected a complete restructuring of its VAT
regime this year, there had been hope that the Budget would bring greater
relief. Mr Barry Gifford, chairman of the Charities Tax Reform Group, said
he was disappointed' that substantial VAT reliefs had not been awarded.
He warned that, by denying financial help to the voluntary sector, charities
'may be forced to reject requests from government to help in supplementing
state provision'. More of this argument is likely to be heard in the
election campaign.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): More choice from a point of principle
 -Married Couple's Allowances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MALE Chauvinist Allowance can now go by its proper name as the married
couple's allowance.
Despite the introduction of independent taxation in 1990, elements of
pre-independence paternalism hung on through the allocation to the husband
of the married couple's allowance - currently Pounds 1,720. The only
exception was in cases where the husband's income was too low for him to
make use of it.
From April 6 1993, married couples can choose who should receive the
allowance or elect to receive half the allowance each. The one case in which
a married couple will make a saving is if the wife is a higher rate taxpayer
while her husband pays tax at the lower rate. She can now obtain tax relief
on Pounds 1,720 at 40 per cent, instead of her husband obtaining it at 25
per cent, saving the couple Pounds 258 a year.
However, there will still be a few instances where it will be worthwhile to
make a change in allocation on the ground of tax-efficiency. But the
government will have scored here on a point of principle at little cost. The
chancellor himself said 'this measure will have only a small effect on
revenue'.
Instead, many working wives will be happy that they are now entitled to
claim half the married couple's allowance even when this has no effect on
the couple's finances.
The new arrangement comes into force from April 6 1993.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Financial spanners for a battered
industry - Cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK motor industry, limping along at new car sales rates not seen since
the 1970s, has been calling increasingly urgently for help. So it gave a big
sigh of relief yesterday when rescue patrolman Lamont turned up, his
battered red box brimming with financial spanners.
Most will give unambiguous help to beleaguered manufacturers and dealers,
who have seen sales fall from a record 2.3m in 1989 to 1.59m last year - a
decline which is continuing. Indeed, by last night an industry consensus was
emerging that the measures overall are likely to push up sales by
60,000-80,000 in a full year.
One spanner, however, may yet turn out to have dropped inconveniently into
the works, at least from the perspective of the big manufacturers such as
Ford.
In ignoring the protests of Customs &amp; Excise, and serving notice that there
will be no VAT penalties for companies offering cash alternatives to company
cars, Mr Lamont may have opened the door to an explosion in 'cash for car'
schemes among companies which believe that their cars are no longer
tax-effective, or which no longer want the hassle of operating them.
There may be thousands of companies in this category, whose employees could
easily opt for a second hand car and cash, or an exotic import, rather than
the Ford, Vauxhall or Rover to which they may previously have been
restricted.
The issue is important because of the sheer size of the company car market.
Around 60 per cent of all sales are to businesses.
For both corporate and private car buyers, however, the Budget's effects
were wholly positive.
The halving of Special Car tax to 5 per cent of a car's wholesale price
means that, as of this morning, about Pounds 400 should have been knocked
off Tuesday's showroom price of a small family car. Higher up the scale, a
Vauxhall Senator 3 litre, 24-valve which had a list price of Pounds 28,630
before Mr Lamont got to his feet should now be retailing at Pounds 2,200
less (before any market-driven discounts).
The Special Car tax cut leaves total purchase taxes on most new cars in the
UK at close to the EC average of about 22 per cent, although still high
compared with German's less than 15 per cent.( In all EC cases, cars
imported from outside the EC are subject to an extra 10 per cent duty).
Even if most companies and employees opt to keep their company cars, the
cars themselves are likely to change as a result of structural changes to
the income tax scale charges payable by employees on their company car
benefit.
Rightly, Mr Lamont yesterday described the current system as arbitrary and
unfair. It comprises a series of 'thresholds' based mainly on engine
capacity but, at the top of the market, on Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000
ceilings above which tax charges are also increased sharply.
The system discriminates against both diesels - which, although more
economical than petrol cars need more capacity for equivalent power - and
specialist executive and luxury car makers such as Jaguar.
A user of a car priced just below the Pounds 29,000 threshold pays 62 per
cent less tax than the operator of a Jaguar costing just over Pounds 29,000.
'It's been very damaging to us,' a Jaguar spokesman said last night.
The prospect of a more simple, graded system in the consultative document
the Inland Revenue will publish in the summer will be welcomed by the entire
industry as a means of smoothing out production and marketing distortions.
Corporate car purchasers have yet to feel the full adverse effects of last
year's Budget, when for the first time Mr Lamont imposed National Insurance
contributions on employers for the company car benefit. The first payments -
for 1991-92 - will not fall due until July, when they will cost business an
estimated total Pounds 750m a year.
That will more than offset Special Car Tax reductions, which will cost the
treasury only Pounds 635m in 1992-93 - and that includes the benefit
accruing to private buyers.
However, the business sector will also benefit from the decision to make
available full capital allowances on cars costing up to Pounds 12,000,
rather than the Pounds 8,000 ceiling which has been in place since 1979.
This represents an extra Pounds 1,000 allowance per car per year.
The industry was under few illusions that Mr Lamont might end another
anomaly - the inability of companies to claim back the 17.5 per cent VAT on
company car purchases, even though theirs is a plight unique within the EC.
Yet even here, Mr Lamont showed generosity, acknowledging that taxis, hire
cars and driving school vehicles are genuinely 'tools of the trade' and
making such vehicles VAT-refundable from August 1.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Bad start to week for the greens -
Environment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE CHANGES in motoring taxation appear to reflect a sad fact of life for
the environmental lobby: that, when it comes to a choice between
vote-winning and green policies, it is usually the vote-winning that
triumphs.
For several years it has been government policy to pursue a cautious shift
in the balance of motoring taxation from car ownership to car use, on the
sensible grounds that those who pollute most should pay most.
Hence, vehicle excise duty - a tax on car ownership - has been frozen at
Pounds 100 since 1985, while the excise duty on petrol - a tax on car use -
has been increased at a rate above inflation.
'This Common Inheritance', the white paper on environmental strategy
published in September 1990, stated that further measures would be
considered to encourage people to burn less fuel in their motoring.
Environmental and public transport lobby groups had hoped to see that happen
this year. The expected cut in car tax offered an unmissable opportunity to
transfer the tax burden to petrol, so cutting the cost of buying cars but
making people think more about how they used them.
Instead, the policy has gone into reverse. The car tax is being cut, but not
at the cost of higher petrol prices. Instead, the six-year freeze on vehicle
excise duty has ended, while in real terms, unleaded and diesel fuel prices
remain unchanged.
That, the green lobby was observed, was hardly likely to lead to less
motoring. Meanwhile, there was gloom on the freight side, too. For nearly a
year, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, has been talking about
his desire to see more freight switch from road to rail. The decision to
freeze excise duties on heavy goods vehicles seemed to fly in the face of
that commitment.
'A juggernaut of a budget,' Friends of the Earth was calling it last night.
What with Monday's announcements of a huge roadbuilding programme, it has
been a bad start to the week for the greens.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): A helping hand for horse-racing
without picking the pockets of the punters - Betting Levy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ONE-THIRD increase in funds flowing to horse-racing from the betting levy
should result from yesterday's budget, according to government officials.
The change is an attempt to ease the problems of horse racing.
General betting duty is being cut by from 8 to 7 3/4 per cent, at the same
time as the racing industry's tax from the Horse-Race Betting Levy Scheme is
to rise.
The government is gambling that the effect of the two measures will leave
the punter paying out the same amount - 10 per cent on stakes and from
winnings - but that racing will get more money.
The Home Office calculates that the levy will now yield about Pounds 48m up
from Pounds 35.5m. The Jockey Club, the sports governing body, had asked for
Pounds 50m. The money is dispersed throughout the sport but is spent
principally on prize money and subsidies for racecourses.
Mr Kenneth Baker, the Home Secretary, said yesterday that, assuming betting
turnover of some Pounds 4.3bn, his scheme aimed to produce a total estimated
levy yield of about Pounds 48m. 'I am satisfied that the bookmakers can make
their levy payments under the scheme without any increase in their
deductions from punters,' he said.
Ladbroke, Britain's biggest bookmaker, said the reduction in betting duty
was a step in the right direction, even though its own recommendations - to
reduce the burden on gamblers, to boost betting turnover, and to increase
the levy yield - had been different, however.
Last year, the Commons home affairs committee noted the impact of the
recession on horse-racing. 'The fat years are gone,' said the committee's
report. Sir John Wheeler, the committee's Conservative chairman, said that
higher contributions to racing should not be paid by small bookmakers, or by
customers.
'We believe that the three big bookmaking firms can and should pay.'
The industry generates Pounds 10bn a year and employs 150,000 people. The
fillip comes at an opportune time because the Budget coincided with the
start of the three-day National Hunt festival at Cheltenham.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): White Paper promises long-overdue
reform - Change in Presentation of Tax and Spending Proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUDGET DAY may be one of the great theatrical events in the British
political calendar, but it has precious little to do with anything that
resembles a proper budget. In effect, there are two half-budgets, with
public spending decisions being announced in the Autumn Statement, while the
means of financing those expenditures remains a carefully kept secret until
the Budget in the following year. The chancellor of the day then sows joy
and despair in equal measure as he pulls rabbits out of his hat and unveils
complex tax measures that have not been subjected to scrutiny in open
debate.
By deciding to bring together the government's tax and spending proposals on
one date in December, Mr Lamont has struck a long overdue blow for more
rational economic policy making. It may not set the C1 and C2 socio-economic
groups alight in Tory marginal constituencies, but it was certainly
theatrical, in the sense that the shadow chancellor has been upstaged. Mr
John Smith had been a cogent advocate of budgetary reform. On this, as on
income tax, he has seen his clothes deftly purloined by the chancellor.
The case for reform has long been accepted. Sir Geoffrey Howe pinned his
colours to the mast in opposition in 1977, but then failed to deliver after
he became chancellor in 1979. A report in 1980 by Lord Armstrong of
Sanderstead for the Institute For Fiscal Studies firmly attacked the
separation of tax and spending decisions and was echoed in a further report
by the Treasury and Civil Service Committee in 1982. But it probably took Mr
Smith's advocacy to bring about this belated enthusiasm for change; and
while the initiative may now have been lost to Mr Lamont, the shadow
chancellor may yet have the last laugh if the first genuine budget, planned
for December 1993, is delivered under Labour.
The case against the present budgetary process is that it is confusing and
incoherent. When revenue and expenditure statements are finally brought
together in the Financial Statement and Budget Report that accompanies the
annual budget, attention inevitably fixes on the tax proposals, since the
spending decisions have been in the public domain for months. Perceptions
are thus distorted; and in the traditional battle on the Finance Bill
Standing committee, ministers frequently fail to give a proper account of
the proposed legislation.
The White Paper that accompanied yesterday's Budget argued that a unified
budget would enable ministers to make better judgments about the merits of
public spending proposals in the light of the overall fiscal position and
the implications for taxation. The components of the government's fiscal
policy will be more clearly presented for parliamentary and public debate.
Few would disagree with this analysis. But there are snags. These include
the delay that will now take place in the publication of departmental
spending plans and the fact that taxation decisions will be taken well
before the start of the new financial year. There will also be a host of
legal and technical obstacles, not least the implication for computer
systems at the Inland Revenue and in industry of merging the two separate
annual coding exercises that now take place for Pay As You Earn purposes.
The government has finally conceded that these problems are outweighed by
the advantages. But it remains to be seen just how open a budgetary process
will emerge in due course. The White Paper says that income tax rates and
allowances will take effect, as they do now, from the start of the tax year.
But there will also be surprises, where there is a risk that taxpayers will
seek to forestall changes to minimise their liability.
That said, the White Paper also emphasises that one of the advantages of
earlier publication of the Finance Bill is that taxpayers and their advisers
will in most cases be aware of the precise form of tax changes long before
the date at which they take effect.
That points to good intentions on the government's part; and it is a
commitment that will be welcomed by fiscal policy buffs and the professional
tax advisory community.
The process whereby a appallingly complex measures such as capital gains tax
are sprung on the electorate without careful preliminary analysis, and then
reformed through an expensive process of trial and error in successive
Finance Acts, might just be over.
That would complete a process that started after former chancellor Mr Nigel
Lawson threatened to scrap tax relief for pension contributions. The
resulting howl of anguish from the powerful pensions lobby prompted a rapid
retreat by Mr Lawson. The outcome was an assurance in the 1985 budget that
complex issues such as the taxation of pensions and the structure of income
tax would be set out in green papers before firm proposals were announced by
the government of the day.
The two stage budgetary process does not have deep historic roots. It dates
from the late 1960s, when the Plowden Report's recommendations on a revised
system of planning public expenditure argued for making allocations to
individual spending authorities well before the start of the financial year.
Since governments continued to present their main tax proposals close to the
beginning of the tax year, a gap opened up.
The Autumn Statement was then introduced in 1982, partly in response to the
Armstrong committee's strictures on the schizophrenic nature of the
resulting budgetary process. Since then the government has tended to publish
earlier and more detailed information on public spending plans. Though
widely welcomed, this tended to accentuate the two-stage nature of the
budgetary timetable.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): A nod towards the problem - Advance
Corporation Tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM GAMMIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE good news for business leaders campaigning for a review of the problem
caused by 'surplus' advance corporation tax (ACT) is that the Chancellor
mentioned it in his speech - the most public official recognition that a
problem exists.
The bad news is that he gave little in the way of promises to deal with the
problem.
The problem stems from the very heart of the corporate tax system. Whenever
a company pays a dividend it must pay advance corporation tax to the Inland
Revenue. The rate of ACT is set by reference to the basic rate of income
tax. Accordingly, after yesterday's Budget, it remains unchanged at
one-third of the dividend paid: on a dividend of 75p, ACT of 25p is paid.
The company can deduct the ACT from the corporation tax on its profits. The
deduction is limited so that with corporation tax at 33 per cent there will
always be a residual 8 per cent liability. Where the company has no taxable
profits, the ACT is an additional tax cost.
When the company earns its profits largely abroad, its UK tax liabilities
may be permanently reduced by the foreign tax it pays. The ACT on its
dividends is then an additional tax cost which it has to write-off in its
accounts. This affects its earnings per share.
CBI and other business bodies have urged the Government to take steps to
tackle this problem. One proposal has been to allow ACT to be deducted from
the residual 8 per cent liability. Another has been to exempt dividends paid
out of foreign income. While acknowledging the problem in his speech, the
Chancellor felt unable to propose immediate measures given the tax cost of
doing anything effective.
The EC is also a factor. In 1990 the Community adopted two Directives which
took effect from 1 January 1992. The first of these permits dividends to be
paid within the Community between a parent company and its subsidiaries
without deduction of tax at source. The second measure enables certain
mergers to take place across Community borders on a tax free basis. A third
measure deals with the resolution of inter-company pricing disputes with
Community tax authorities. The Government published draft legislation in
December 1991 to implement these measures and this will be included in the
Finance Bill.
More radical proposals may shortly be made by the Ruding Committee,
established by the Commission at the end of 1990 to look more fundamentally
at the future of company tax systems in the Community.
The Ruding Committee will publish its recommendations on 18 March. Those
proposals may propose that the UK and other Community countries adopt
measures that would then solve the UK's surplus ACT problem. In the light of
that, the Chancellor clearly felt unable to make proposals which might
shortly be overtaken by events.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Smoother passage for the cascade of
wealth - Inheritance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME Minister's vision of wealth 'cascading down the generations' has
found its Budget echo not in the widely predicted radical overhaul - or even
abolition - of inheritance tax, but instead in proposals which are designed
to smooth the transfer of ownership of family businesses and farms.
Until now, the effect of IHT business relief has been to reduce the taxable
value of shares in family businesses by either 30 per cent or 50 per cent,
depending on the type of business and the number of shares held. Under the
new rules, no tax at all will be payable on transfers of unincorporated
businesses and shareholdings of more than 25 per cent in private companies
and those dealt in on the Unlisted Securities Market. The same exemption
will also be available on farm tenancies and owner-occupied farmland.
In addition to taking these assets completely outside the tax net, the
Chancellor is introducing a 50 per cent relief for sub-25 per cent interests
in private and USM companies, controlling holdings in fully quoted companies
and interests of landlords in let farmland.
All these changes apply to tax charges arising on or after Budget day. This
will also expunge liabilities which would otherwise have arisen on deaths
from yesterday onwards in respect of transfers made in the past seven years.
In spite of the increase in rates, the scope of business relief is not being
extended, which means that shareholders in property and investment companies
will continue to be excluded.
For ageing family entrepreneurs, the new 100 per cent relief will do away
with the current tax planning imperative to pass control to the next
generation and then survive for at least seven years.
For the USM, which has been stagnating, the proposals are likely to provide
a shot in the arm. In particular, the 50 per cent relief for small USM
stakes raises the possibility that USM stock picking will become a popular
form of deathbed tax planning.
The only general IHT change is that the threshold above which tax becomes
payable is raised from Pounds 140,000 to Pounds 150,000. This is a 7.5 per
cent increase compared with what would otherwise have been an automatic 4.5
per cent hike for inflation.
Removing family businesses from the tax net is another body blow to the
viability of IHT. The tax is now in a state of unstable equilibrium. Yet
more concessions from a re-elected Tory government would seem to lead almost
inexorably to the abolition of what is becoming a largely toothless tax. A
Labour Chancellor would no doubt have very different ideas.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Helping the smallest offenders, but
doing little for the big fish - Changes to VAT Rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME of the harshest VAT penalties are being softened though the basic
rules, which have been much criticised, remain unchanged.
Traders who make 'serious misdeclarations' and pay or declare too little VAT
are liable to stiff penalties, even if the errors are honest ones. Penalties
will now be reduced to 15 per cent of the amount misdeclared, from the
current rate of 20 per cent. This follows a reduction last year from 30 per
cent. A misdeclaration of Pounds 2,000 will not attract the penalty at all.
This will take out many of the current penalties, affecting mainly the
smaller company.
The penalty has been much criticised by traders, since it applies, for
example, to a business which reports VAT in the wrong quarter of the year by
mistake. Whether it is charged at 20 per cent or 30 per cent, these
criticisms will still be valid.
There is also to a cut in the rate of the default surcharge payable by a
trader who submits a return late unless there is a 'reasonable excuse'. The
rate of the surcharge is to be reduced to 20 per cent from the current 30
per cent, but there are no proposals to change the rules on what constitutes
a reasonable excuse.
The reduction will be welcome news to the smaller business which finds the
quarterly reporting difficult to meet, and regularly submits returns late,
but a 20 per cent fine on a delay for traders who have a short term lapse is
likely to remain highly unpopular.
The proposal will therefore do little to ease the workload of VAT tribunals,
which spend much of their time hearing cases of appeal against the default
surcharge. There will be a further review of the penalties arrangements,
however. A consultative document has been issued.
The introduction of the new VAT proposals for the single market, from 1
January 1993, will eliminate import procedures that have been a source of
cash flow for the Trea - sury.
In October last year Customs announced that they were to introduce a monthly
VAT accounting system affecting roughly 200 big companies that accounted for
more than Pounds 2m VAT each year.
There were two concerns. One that these companies would incur cash flow
costs themselves in order to fund the Treasury. Nothing has been done to
relieve that cost. The second was that there would be significant disruption
and costs involved in accounting on a monthly basis.
The costs involved have been estimated at as much as Pounds 1m for some of
the larger companies. Companies had asked that at least to avoid these costs
they should be able to make payments on account, and this has now been
accepted. Payments on account will start in November this year.
A number of companies were planning action in the courts to challenge
Customs' imposition of the monthly charge. They will be considering their
response over the next few days.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Income Distribution): Tory legacy of gains in
disposable income - Tax and Benefit Changes Since 1987
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many of the most radical changes to the tax and social security system
implemented by the Conservative government during its 13 years in power have
occurred during the current parliament.
Since 1987 the top rate of income tax has fallen from 60 per cent to 40 per
cent and the basic rate from 27 per cent to 25 per cent. In 1990 the joint
taxation of husband and wife was replaced by a system of independent
taxation. National insurance contributions have been reformed and reduced.
VAT has risen from 15 per cent to 17.5 per cent. Domestic rates have been
replaced by the community charge. On the benefit side, the social security
reforms of 1988 were presented as the most far-reaching supplementary
benefit, family credit replaced family income supplement, while housing
benefit was reformed and its scope reduced.
Given such an array of changes it is extraordinarily difficult to gain a
clear idea of what their combined effect has been. Hence we use the IFS Tax
and Benefit Model to assess that impact. The model is a computer program
which uses a large dataset containing information on 7,000 households
representative of the population as a whole. Given this information, the
model allows a comparison to be made between the effects of any two tax and
benefit systems on the population. Here we compare the effect of the system
as it stood in April 1987 with that which followed the 1991 Budget. (We
include in the latter system the child benefit increases which occurred in
October of 1991). The systems are made comparable by uprating the benefit
rates and allowances of the 1987 system by the RPI to 1991 prices.
The two figures show the results of this comparison. Figure 3 shows the
proportions of households of particular types gaining and losing, along with
the average gain/loss among households of these types. Households are
divided according to the age of the head, their employment status, marital
status, and the number of children.
Thus, we have classified all households headed by somebody over state
pensionable age as pensioners, any others not in work are placed in the
non-working categories, which thus include groups such as students and the
disabled, not just the unemployed. The other categories are
self-explanatory, except that all households containing more than one family
(as defined for benefit purposes) are lumped together in multiple family
household categories.
Overall, 62 per cent of the population gained from the changes, 27 per cent
lost, and 11 per cent were unaffected (affected by less than Pounds 1 per
week either way). However, the distribution of gainers and losers by family
type is uneven. Only 6 per cent of two-earner couples without children lost
from the changes, with 87 per cent gaining, while 63 per cent of the single
out of work lost and 31 per cent gained. More pensioners gained than lost,
with married pensioners doing rather better than single pensioners.
The proportion gaining and losing is reflected to some extent in the average
gains/losses by household type. Remember, though, that average gains or
losses can be greatly influenced by a few people gaining or losing a large
amount. The average gain for the population is about Pounds 350 per year,
with the biggest gains amoung two-earner couples, but small net losses among
some of those not in work.
Before commenting further on these figures it is useful also to look at the
results by income range. The combination of information allows a better
explanation of what has actually happened. Figure 4 shows the same results
as before but by gross income rather than by family type. The income measure
we use is total income before state benefits have been received or taxes
have been paid. Hence a large proportion of our sample is in the under
Pounds 500 per year category, these being people  - largely pensioners and
the unemployed - whose only source of income is social security.
The results are quite striking. The poorest group lost an average of Pounds
150 per year as a result of changes over the period, with about two-thirds
of the group losing and only about one fifth gaining. As original income
increases, both the proportion of gainers and the size of average gains
increase. Indeed, only in our lowest income group are there more losers than
gainers, and average gains of Pounds 50 per year start in the Pounds
2,600-Pounds 5,200 range. The population average gain is not reached until
the Pounds 15,600-Pounds 20,800 per week range is reached. Of the small
group with incomes of more than Pounds 50,000 a year, more than 95 per cent
are gaining, with an average gain of about Pounds 7,000 a year.
These results are clearly consistent with those derived by family type,
where we saw the poorest groups - the unemployed and pensioners - doing
badly and the richest groups, those in work, doing best. The single most
important reason for the gains among the employed and the rich has been the
reduction in income tax, with the biggest gains accruing to higher rate
taxpayers. They enjoyed the maximum gain from the 2 per cent fall in the
basic rate of tax as well as benefiting from the abolition of tax rates over
40 per cent. Most people in employment also benefited from the reforms to
the National Insurance system implemented in the 1989 Budget. These had the
effect that employees no longer had to pay their full rate of national
insurance on earnings under the lower earnings limit, but rather a lower
rate of 2 per cent.
One other important reform to the income tax system - the change to
independent taxation - affected relatively few people, but the impact on
some of those who were affected was considerable. Among single-earner
couples those where just the wife was working lost from the change as the
total level of allowances for this group fell by the amount of a single
personal allowance. On the other hand, where the wife had a significant
amount of unearned income there were gains. Under the old system of joint
taxation the investment income of a married woman was taxed as if it
belonged to her husband. Under independent taxation married women can use
their own personal tax allowance to set against both earned and unearned
income.
As the charts make clear there were some losers both among the employed and
those on high incomes. These resulted largely from the increase in VAT in
last year's Budget, but also reflect the restriction of mortgage interest
relief to the basic rate and the continuing fall in the real value of the
ceiling for mortgage interest relief, which has remained at Pounds 30,000
since 1983.
Some poorer employees will also have lost out as a result of the reforms to
the housing benefit system which reduced its generosity. This change was
even more important to pensioners, who were the biggest losers from the
reform. In particular many fell foul of the newly imposed capital limit.
Housing benefit entitlement is now reduced for anybody with savings of more
than Pounds 8,000 and stopped entirely for those with more than Pounds
16,000 in savings. The fact that pensioner couples did better than single
pensioners is a straightforward reflection of the higher average incomes of
married pensioners who were thus more likely to gain from income tax cuts
and less likely to lose from housing benefit changes.
Overall the groups with the largest average loss and most losers were the
single without work and those with little or no non-state income generally.
Among the single people not in work two groups did particularly badly from
policy changes over the period. The first were single unemployed under the
age of 25 living away from the parental home and dependent on supplementary
benefit, now income support. The new income support benefit has a special
low rate for under 25-year-olds, and so the transition from supplementary
benefit to income support led to a straightforward fall in the income of
this group. Second, students have suffered very large falls in their
entitlements to state benefits recently. In particular most students are no
longer entitled to claim income support or housing benefit at all, leading
in some cases to quite substantial losses.
In 1988 social security reforms were specifically intended to target more
help on poor families with children both through the income support and
family credit benefits. This shows up in our figures to some extent. While
most non-working couples without children lost over the period, rather fewer
than half of those with children lost. Among single parents there were some
quite substantial gainers leading to a gain on average despite nearly half
losing some income. Finally, among single earner couples those with children
did rather better than those without, partly as a result of the introduction
of family credit which is considerably more generous than the old family
income support.
Other changes brought in with the 1988 reforms which affected many on income
support were the ending of 100 per cent rebates for rates payments and the
ending of the automatic payment of water rates. Though the benefits were
intended to be at such a level as to compensate people on average for this
change many were effectively not compensated in full. This change in the
benefit regime in fact, had a greater impact on those with very low incomes
than did the actual change from rates to the community charge.
Overall, the effect of tax and benefit changes since 1987 has been to
increase the disposable income of more than 60 per cent of the population
and reduce that of about a quarter of households. But the losses are
concentrated in the lower reaches of the income distribution and among those
not in work. The benefit reforms are largely responsible for this. On the
other hand, those in work or in the middle and higher income ranges have
seen gains on average. The biggest gains are concentrated among the richest.
These gains are a direct effect of income tax and national insurance
reductions.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (The Chancellor's Speech): A Budget 'to help
people make most of recovery' - Budgets to be moved to December - Income tax
reduced to 20p in Pounds for first Pounds 2,000 - 'No plans' for higher VAT
 -50% cut in car tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, rose to deliver his
Budget speech at 3.31 pm and completed it at 4.40pm, a duration of 1 hour
and 9 minutes. He said:
'Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to begin by announcing a far-reaching reform that
will affect our entire system of public finance.
Each year the Budget for this country is presented in two parts. In the
autumn, the chancellor announces the government's spending plans for the
coming financial year. And in March he sets out the revenue measures
necessary to pay for them.
Many have criticised this uniquely British institution. Elsewhere in the
world, and indeed everywhere in the private sector, the meaning of the word
budget is crystal clear - it is a schedule showing where the money is coming
from, and where it's going to.
In my view, the current system is not only illogical, it has also had a
number of highly undesirable consequences. Over the years the separation of
public expenditure from taxation and the announcement of tax proposals in
isolation has intensified the pressure for special reliefs and contributed
to the excessively complex tax system we have now. The time has come for
reform.
I therefore intend that next year's Budget will be the last spring Budget.
From then on the annual Budget will be in December, and it will cover not
just taxation but also public expenditure. The Budget in December 1993 will
contain the government's proposals for both revenues and expenditure in
1994-95. It will also include spending plans for the subsequent two years.
The 1994 Finance Bill will be presented to the House in January rather than
April.
I am publishing today a white paper on the mechanics of this change. I
believe that it will lead to better decisions about both taxation and
spending. It will enable spending plans to be considered alongside the tax
plans needed to pay for them. Above all, it will enable government and
parliament to make informed and rational choices between spending measures
and tax changes. I hope it will be warmly welcomed by the House.
Mr Deputy Speaker, this year's Budget is a Budget for the recovery. As
usual, I shall begin with the current economic situation and prospects. I
shall then deal with monetary policy and the public finances. Finally, I
will present my tax proposals. The Financial Statement and Budget Report,
together with a number of press releases filling out the details of my
proposals, will be available from the Vote Office as soon as I have sat
down.
World developments and prospects
I turn first to international developments. 1991 saw the weakest growth in
the major seven economies in a decade, while industrial production in the G7
actually fell. This brought a sharp slowdown in the growth of world trade,
which was exacerbated by the dramatic events in the former Soviet Union.
In the United States recovery was generally expected in the second half of
last year. But, despite low interest rates, the upturn appeared to falter
towards the end of 1991. High levels of debt have made firms and households
very cautious about spending, while banks have been reluctant to increase
their lending.
In Japan there have been similar problems, and growth has slowed sharply. In
the year to January, industrial production actually fell by 4 per cent.
The slowdown in world growth has been accompanied by lower inflation in
nearly all the major economies. G7 inflation fell from over 5 per cent at
the beginning of last year to about 3 per cent now.
But economic developments in continental Europe have been dominated by
events in Germany. Over-rapid expansion of domestic demand, following
reunification, led to a rise in German inflation.
The German authorities responded by increasing interest rates and Germany
has now moved into recession. As a consequence, other European economies are
experiencing high real interest rates and weak domestic demand.
But falling inflation, and the cuts in interest rates that have already
taken place in North America and Japan, will in time lead to a pick up in
confidence and demand. And as the underlying level of German inflation
abates, I expect to see reductions in European interest rates.
GDP in the seven major economies is projected to grow by about 1 1/2 per
cent in 1992, and world trade by about 4 per cent. We can expect more rapid
growth in later years as the recovery gains momentum.
Mr Deputy Speaker, some have argued that delayed recovery in the US, and the
slowdowns in Japan and Europe, are not just a cyclical phenomenon, of the
kind we have seen before, but herald something much more serious. It would
be irresponsible for anyone in my position simply to ignore such claims.
But I do not believe they are well founded. I believe that governments have
learned the lessons of the past. Above all, they recognise that nothing
could be more damaging to the world economy than a relapse into
protectionism, of the sort that we saw in the 1930s.
Indeed a crucial challenge for governments is not merely to preserve the
current world trading order, but to extend it. Unfortunately, not all of our
Community partners see this as clearly as we in Britain do. But narrow
sectional interests must not be allowed to prevent the current Gatt
negotiations reaching a rapid and successful conclusion. The prosperity of
the world in the decades ahead rests squarely on the freedom to trade. The
most significant development in the British economy over the last year has
been the sharp and sustained reduction in inflation. Retail price inflation
has fallen to around 4 per cent, close to the German level, while underlying
producer price inflation is at its lowest level for a generation.
Average earnings, too, are rising at the lowest rate for 25 years,
suggesting that, after a decade of supply-side reform, the British labour
market is operating far more effectively than before. This augurs well for
employment prospects in the longer term.
But, as elsewhere in the world, activity and demand in Britain have been
weak. The rapid increase in demand in the late 1980s, fuelled by a sharp
fall in saving and large increases in indebtedness, made a period of
adjustment inevitable. Companies and households that borrowed extensively
have reined in spending and repaid debt in response to higher interest
rates.
Following a substantial reduction in interest rates, there were clear signs
of renewed growth in the late summer and early autumn of last year - not
just in confidence surveys, but also in the figures for retail sales and
economic activity more generally. But, as in the United States, the recovery
here was not sustained.
The effect on the British economy of recent world developments, and
particularly those in the United States, cannot simply be measured by the
adverse consequences for British exports. British firms have factories and
offices abroad - indeed, our investment in the US is higher than that of any
other country. Conditions in one country can and do affect business
confidence elsewhere. So unexpected weakness in the rest of the world has
taken its toll on confidence in Britain, discouraging investment and
stockbuilding. Over the year as a whole, GDP fell by nearly 2 1/2 per cent,
 1/2 per cent more than my forecast of a year ago.
Outlook for 1992 and 1993
Most independent forecasters agree that 1992 will see the resumption of
economic growth. The recovery is expected to start slowly, but to gather
pace. I expect growth in the year to the second half of 1992 to be almost 2
per cent. The level of GDP for this year as a whole should be about 1 per
cent higher than last.
As inflation in Britain has fallen, so too have interest rates. And that has
put money in the pockets of mortgage payers. Indeed, a typical family with a
Pounds 30,000 mortgage is now more than 15 per cent better off in real terms
than in October 1990 - nearly Pounds 30 a week. That represents a
considerable stock of pent-up spending power, which will in time feed
through to stronger consumer spending.
Output will also be boosted by stronger export growth as the world economy
recovers. Our share of world trade in manufactures rose in 1991 for the
third successive year, despite the world slowdown. And I expect further
gains in the future as lower inflation leads to improved competitiveness.
The current account deficit for last year was about Pounds 4 1/2 bn, 3/4 per
cent of GDP. As domestic demand recovers, the deficit is likely to widen a
little this year. At 1 per cent of GDP for the year as a whole, it will be
easily financeable.
Even with a resumption of growth unemployment is likely to go on rising for
some time. But, while the increases will moderate over the months ahead, a
sustained reduction in unemployment over the longer term will depend
crucially on our success in keeping inflation down. And the prospects for
that are better than at any time in recent economic history.
I expect retail price inflation to fall decisively below 4 per cent by the
end of the year and to be close to 3 per cent by the middle of 1993.
Producer price inflation will be even lower, down to 2 per cent by the end
of this year and to 1 1/2 per cent by the middle of 1993.
Longer term
A whole generation has grown up to accept inflation as an unalterable fact
of life. But we are now making steady progress towards price stability - an
environment in which the decisions of businesses and consumers are no longer
distorted by the expectation of a general upward movement in prices.
Inflation has been the scourge of our economy for decades; and its defeat,
not just here but elsewhere in Europe, will represent a tremendous
achievement, bringing enormous benefits to British businesses and families.
There are those who would put this at risk by seeking to pump up demand. But
I am not prepared to take steps which would call into question the
Government's determination to match or better the inflation performance of
our Community partners.
And even if it were thought desirable it is not remotely feasible for
governments to try to target the level of demand month by month or quarter
by quarter. Having made such progress in getting inflation down, it would be
tragic now to throw it all away with an ill-judged or ill-timed attempt to
kick-start demand.
The challenge before us is not to provide some artificial short-term
stimulus to the economy. It is to continue the supply-side reforms of the
1980s. Low tax and light government have produced an economic environment
which spurs competition and rewards enterprise. Our job now is to build on
them to help people and businesses make the most of recovery. And that will
be the theme of my Budget today.
Between 1979 and the end of 1990, the number of businesses rose by almost a
third. Even during the recession capital spending on plant and machinery has
remained higher as a proportion of GDP than at any point in the 1970s. As a
result we have seen exceptional growth in manufacturing productivity -
faster than in any other G7 country in the 1980s. Industrial relations have
been transformed. Fewer days were lost to industrial action in 1991 than in
any year since records began a century ago.
The confidence of foreign investors in Britain's renewed economic strength
is demonstrated by our continued high share of inward investment. Almost
half of the direct investment in the EC from the US and Japan comes to the
UK. Those investors recognise that Britain, with its low taxes, good
industrial relations and stable currency, is the right place to come to
exploit the opportunities of the single European market.
And whether or not the United Kingdom decides to participate in a move to a
single European currency, we will be among those who meet the strict
conditions required for entry. The government believes that these conditions
provide a valuable framework for setting policy in the medium term.
And that means that monetary policy is primarily directed at the maintenance
of sterling's parity within the Exchange Rate Mechanism. In due course we
will move to the narrow band of the ERM, at the current central rate of
2.95DM.
Since ERM entry was announced in October 1990 sterling has remained within
its permitted ERM bands, while interest rates have been reduced by 4 1/2 per
cent. The differential between UK and German interest rates is now at its
lowest for a decade.
In common with all the major countries within the ERM I shall set a domestic
monetary target. M0, the narrow measure of money, has stayed comfortably
within the range I set in the last Budget. For the year ahead I propose to
continue the target range for narrow money of 0 to 4 per cent. This is
consistent with a further fall in inflation combined with a recovery in
output. I shall continue to watch closely other indicators of monetary
conditions, including broad money and asset prices.
I turn now to the public sector finances. The slowdown in the world economy
over the last year has led to larger budget deficits in most industrial
countries. Tax revenues and spending on some social security programmes
largely depend upon the level of economic activity. So, in a recession, tax
receipts are lower while social security spending rises.
But, thanks to my predecessors, we in Britain have the great advantage of
having a ratio of government debt to GDP that is very low by both historical
and international standards. Indeed, the general government debt burden is
lower in the UK than in any other European Community country bar Luxembourg.
That means that a rise in borrowing in response to cyclical pressures will
not jeopardise the government's firm commitment to sound finance.
The objective of fiscal policy remains to balance the budget over the medium
term. In a recession borrowing will tend to rise. But there is nothing wrong
with that, providing the underlying position is sound, and the budget moves
back towards balance as the economy recovers. Indeed it makes good economic
sense to allow the level of government borrowing to vary in this way over
the business cycle.
For the year ending in April, I expect a PSBR of a little under Pounds 14bn,
or 2 1/4 per cent of GDP. The rise in the forecast since the Autumn
Statement is due for the most part to the impact of weaker activity on
revenues, rather than to higher public spending. Indeed planned public
expenditure this year is likely to be a little below the level I set in last
year's Budget.
1992-93 Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
Since the full impact of the recession, on both tax revenues and public
expenditure, feeds through only with a time lag, the PSBR will increase
further in 1992-93. Taking account of the measures I am announcing today, my
forecast implies a PSBR next year of some 4 1/2 per cent of GDP, about
Pounds 28 bn.
As I have said the increased borrowing requirement reflects the delayed
impact of weaker activity over the last year. Even so, I expect it to be
rather lower than that of Germany, and less than half the level seen in
Britain following the recession in the mid 1970s. The ratio of Government
debt to GDP will rise slightly next year. But our debt burden will remain
very low by international standards.
And as the economy recovers, and growth gathers pace, the PSBR will move
back towards balance, and the debt burden will resume its downward trend.
During 1991-92 the borrowing requirement has been fully funded, and that
policy will continue over the year ahead. An increased amount will be funded
through National Savings. A new product, a guaranteed growth bond designed
to appeal to taxpayers, will be launched in the summer.
Mr Deputy Speaker, the prosperity of this country does not stem from
government, but from the enterprise and initiative of the British people and
of British business. A recurrent theme of the Budgets delivered by my
distinguished predecessors has been the desire to create a framework in
which economic decisions are taken on their own merits, and not in response
to distortions created by the tax system. In continuing that tradition
today, my Budget will ensure that recovery is not based on some short-term
boost from government, but on the decisions taken by the private sector.
The proposals I shall be presenting today should be seen in the context of
the benefits business will receive from the measures I announced last year.
In my last Budget, I cut the main rate of corporation tax by a full two
percentage points, to 33 per cent, for profits earned in the 1991 financial
year. That has given Britain a lower rate of corporation tax than any of our
major competitors. And I propose to leave it unchanged for the year ahead.
Because corporation tax is paid in arrears, companies will only feel the
full impact of last year's cut in the coming year. Combined with the other
corporation tax measures I announced last year, it will bene-fit businesses
by some Pounds 1bn in 1992-93.
And in my Autumn Statement I announced substantial increases in public
sector investment. In the financial year beginning April 1, investment in
roads and public transport will be Pounds 5bn, and capital spending on the
National Health Service will be more than Pounds 2bn. Next year, public
sector asset creation - in other words total investment spending by the
public sector - will amount to nearly Pounds 30bn.
Over the last decade, this Government has fully demonstrated its commitment
to investment in our public infrastructure. And it would be wholly wrong to
allow the impact of the recession on the fiscal deficit to lead to cuts in
our long-term investment programmes, as occurred in the 1970s.
But it would be equally wrong to expect public investment or an
ever-expanding public sector to lead the recovery. The recovery will only be
sustainable if it is led by the private sector. Investment does not take
place in a vacuum. Good quality private sector investment will come not from
artificial subsidies or incentives, but in response to consumer demand.
One suggestion that has been put to me is that I should raise first year
capital allowances. I have considered this proposition very carefully. I
would be as concerned as anyone if I thought that the corporation tax system
introduced in 1984 was acting as a drag on profitable investment.
But, on average, the current tax rules allow capital investment to be
written off more quickly than economic depreciation would imply. And in
current circumstances, any general increase in capital allowances would
primarily benefit large and profitable businesses. Moreover, given the way
the corporation tax system works, these benefits would not flow through into
companies' cash flow until the year after next.
And the evidence suggests that the cost of higher capital allowances to the
Exchequer would be several times greater than the resulting increase in
investment over the next few years. I have therefore concluded that,
whatever its superficial attractions, an increase in capital allowances
would not be a sensible use of the resources available.
Non-domestic rate
Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a far better way to help business this year. I
have decided to bring forward proposals that will be of early benefit to
some 900,000 non-domestic properties, large and small, throughout the United
Kingdom.
Business in England and Wales has gained much from the introduction of the
Uniform Business Rate in 1990. During the 1980s, when business rates were
set by local authorities, poundages in England rose on average by over 37
per cent more than inflation. Under the new system, rate poundages are
capped in real terms.
In some cases, however, the changes in bills have been substantial, and many
businesses have faced a difficult adjustment. That is why, when we
introduced the Uniform Business Rate, the government eased the transition by
phasing in the losses of those who faced large changes in their bills.
But I am well aware that many of the businesses which face large increases
next year have also been hard hit by the recession. I have therefore decided
that their burdens should not be compounded by real increases in business
rates.
The government proposes to amend the transitional arrangements already
enacted for next year's business rates in England and Wales to ensure that
no business property will face a real increase in rates next year. The bills
for properties protected by the transitional arrangements will increase by
no more than the rate of inflation, like those for other properties. 500,000
business properties in England and Wales will benefit at a cost to the
exchequer of Pounds 320m in 1992-93. The present statutory limits on real
annual increases in rate bills will apply again from 1993-94. Since such
increases will be from a lower base, there will be a further cost of Pounds
220m in 1993-94.
The present rules mean that new occupiers are not eligible for transitional
relief. As the property market has weakened, this has made it more difficult
for businesses to move. I therefore propose to allow businesses occupying
new premises after midnight tonight to inherit the transitional protection
available to the previous occupier, at a further cost of about Pounds 25m.
This should help to increase mobility and unlock the property market.
But it would be wrong to concentrate help only on those businesses who lose
from the new arrangements. While the transitional arrangements have
postponed losses for some companies, they have also delayed the gains for
those who did worst out of the old system. I believe that businesses should
see the full benefits more rapidly. I therefore propose to accelerate their
gains.
From 1993-94 onwards I propose that all businesses gaining from the 1990
reforms should be allowed to have their gains in full. So by then, no
business will be paying higher business rates than it should be doing under
the new system.
And in the coming year, I propose that the maximum reductions in the rate
bills of the gainers should be raised to 22 per cent in real terms for large
properties and to 27 per cent for small properties. Those limits are 9
percentage points higher than in the current year. 150,000 business
properties in England and Wales will benefit at a revenue cost of Pounds 85
million in 1992-93.
These changes will not reduce the income of local authorities. Subject to
parliament's approval, the government will pay extra money into the
non-domestic rates pool to make good the shortfall in business rates
revenue. These payments will not add to public expenditure.
The government will introduce special legislation as soon as practicable to
implement these proposals. In the meantime, local authorities should send
out bills and collect business rates in accordance with the existing
legislation and regulations. Business rate bills on properties in transition
will be cut, and adjustment made for earlier higher levels of payment, when
parliament has approved the legislation and local authorities can send out
the new lower bills.
The proposals I have outlined will apply to business properties in England
and Wales, reducing the total business rates bill next year by 3 1/4 per
cent. Scotland and Northern Ireland each have different arrangements for
business rates. The government proposes that their total rates bills next
year should likewise be reduced by 3 1/4 per cent. My Rt Honourable Friends
the Scottish and Northern Ireland secretaries will be announcing the
details.
These measures will bring significant and early benefit to many thousands of
businesses throughout the United Kingdom. The revenue cost will be Pounds
480m in 1992-93 and Pounds 590m in 1993-94, but will fall away rapidly in
subsequent years.
Proposals affecting small business
My proposals on the UBR will be of particular benefit to small businesses -
the lifeblood of a modern economy. Small businesses have been at the heart
of the supply side revolution in this country over the last decade. The
result has been a new economic dynamism, with increased competition and a
more flexible labour market.
Inevitably, taxation and regulation bear most heavily on small firms. So I
have considered carefully what measures I can take to ease that burden, and
in particular to ease the cash flow of small businesses.
Last year I raised the VAT registration threshold by some 40 per cent. This
year I propose to increase the threshold in line with inflation, to Pounds
36,600.
135,000 traders, one-third of all those eligible, now use the cash
accounting scheme for VAT, which allows small firms to delay their VAT
payments until they themselves have been paid. I can now announce that the
rules will be relaxed to allow traders owing less than Pounds 5,000 to
Customs to use cash accounting. I hope this will encourage many more traders
to take advantage of this excellent scheme.
My decision last year to allow small employers to pay income tax and
national insurance deducted at source on a quarterly rather than monthly
basis was widely welcomed by small employers. I propose to raise the
qualifying limit to Pounds 450 a month. That will mean that nearly  3/4 m
employers will be able to make payments quarterly rather than monthly.
But one problem arouses more anger in the small business community than any
other. I have every sympathy for small companies who find that their larger
debtors are deliberately delaying payment to boost their own cashflow. Such
practices are wholly deplorable.
And while there is no easy solution, my Rt Honourable Friends and I have
looked hard at what the government can do to help. I have a number of
proposals to announce.
First, the government proposes to require larger companies to state in their
annual report and accounts how quickly they pay. Second, my Noble and
Learned Friend the Lord Chancellor will be proposing simpler procedures in
small claims and debt recovery cases.
And third, I want to see the government's good record on the payment of its
bills extended to firms who win government contracts. From next month, those
successfully negotiating a contract with a government department will be
required to include clauses in their own contracts with subcontractors which
provide for the prompt payment of bills, ordinarily within 30 days of
receiving a valid invoice. I believe that government has set a good example.
And I hope large companies will follow.
VAT penalties
For businesses facing cashflow difficulties, VAT penalties can be the last
straw. It has been put to me on many occasions that the VAT penalty regime
is too strict. The Serious Misdeclaration Penalty is catching too many minor
mistakes. That must stop. In future, Customs will not normally charge
penalties on underdeclarations of tax of up to Pounds 2,000. That will take
over three quarters of cases out of the penalty regime, although the largest
mistakes will still be penalised.
Last year I reduced the rate of penalty from 30 to 20 per cent. I now
propose to cut it further, to 15 per cent. But there are other aspects of
the regime which require more consideration, and Customs are issuing today a
further consultation document on the options for longer-term reform.
I believe that the highest rates of default surcharge levied on traders who
submit late VAT returns or payments cannot be justified.
I therefore propose to reduce the maximum rate from 30 per cent to 20 per
cent. These measures, taken together, will reduce the penalties businesses
might otherwise have had to pay customs by Pounds 35m next year.
One of the other complaints I have heard most frequently over the years is
that it is unjust that taxpayers cannot be awarded costs when they appeal
before the Special Commissioners. I now propose to introduce a measure which
would give the Lord Chancellor power to make new rules about the hearing of
appeals, including the powers to award costs where either party has acted
wholly unreasonably.
Inheritance tax
I have one final change to announce which will be of substantial benefit,
particularly to small family businesses.
I propose to take most family businesses out of inheritance tax altogether.
This will cost Pounds 10m in 1992-93, and Pounds 25m in 1993-94.
Relief from inheritance tax for interests in unincorporated businesses,
shareholdings greater than 25 per cent in unquoted companies, and for
working farmers will be increased from 50 per cent to 100 per cent.
Shares dealt on the unlisted securities market, which are generally less
liquid than shares with a full stock market quotation, will from today be
treated like unquoted shares. That means that shareholdings of over 25 per
cent will also generally be free from IHT. For shareholdings of 25 per cent
or less in unquoted companies, and for agricultural landlords, the rate of
relief will rise from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. The 50 per cent relief
will also extend to smaller shareholdings in USM companies and to
controlling shareholdings in quoted companies.
Inheritance and capital are no longer a privilege of the wealthy few.
Ordinary families want to be able to pass on the wealth they have built up
over their lives to their children, without an excessive proportion being
taken by tax. Over the years to come I shall continue to look for ways of
lightening the burden of inheritance tax.
And this year I propose to raise the threshold for inheritance tax by more
than inflation, to Pounds 150,000. This will cost about Pounds 10m in
1992-93.
I intend to raise the threshold for capital gains tax in line with
inflation, to Pounds 5,800.
Taken together the measures that I am proposing on business rates, on VAT
and on inheritance tax will be of very substantial benefit to British
business as a whole and to small business in particular in the year ahead.
Over the last year I have received many representations about surplus
advance corporation tax. ACT is paid by companies when they pay dividends.
It serves two purposes - first, to discharge the shareholders' basic rate
income tax liability, and second, as a payment towards the company's own
corporation tax liability. But some companies paying dividends out of
foreign profits taxed abroad find that they are now paying more ACT than
they can set against UK tax.
This is a significant problem for those affected. But it is also highly
complex, and huge amounts of revenue are potentially at stake.
A satisfactory and lasting solution will need to address the ways in which
different national systems of corporation tax interact. This is currently
the subject of a review sponsored by the European Commission, and it is
clearly an issue to which the government will have to return.
And its importance is of course increased by the abolition, from January 1
1993, of fiscal frontiers within the European Community. That will give
British business access to the largest home market in the world.
But it will also necessitate a number of technical changes to our VAT and
excise systems. As I announced last October, one consequence of the single
market is that businesses who import from other EC countries will pay VAT on
those imports later than they do now, giving some 90,000 businesses a
welcome cashflow benefit.
This change will add substantially to the PSBR in 1992-93. I therefore
announced last year that, from this autumn, the largest VAT payers - those
who paid over Pounds 2m in VAT in 1990-91 - would be required to submit VAT
returns monthly rather than quarterly as now.
It has been put very forcefully to me that the requirement for monthly
returns would place an undue administrative burden on the businesses
concerned. I have listened carefully to these representations, and I now
intend to take steps to allay the concerns raised by those affected.
I have asked customs to implement a system of monthly payments on account
for these large businesses. But I propose to allow them to continue to
submit returns quarterly. This will avoid the requirement to fill in VAT
returns every month, while still offsetting the cost to the Exchequer of
postponed accounting for imports.
Compared to my original proposal for monthly returns, payments on account
will cost the Exchequer some Pounds 200m in 1992-93, with a corresponding
benefit to the businesses concerned. I will be bringing forward legislation
to establish the basis for these new arrangements.
I also propose to introduce legislation to prevent the business tax rules
being manipulated to secure an unjustifiable tax deferment when rent is paid
between connected persons. The manipulation which has already occurred has
involved tax of some hundreds of millions of pounds. This loophole will be
closed immediately.
I have one change to make to the Business Expansion Scheme. It has been put
to me that the BES could play a valuable part in helping to ease the problem
of mortgage repossessions. At present companies can use the BES to acquire
empty repossessed houses, but there are complications if the houses are
still occupied. I propose to make it easier for the BES to be used for
mortgage rescue schemes, where owner-occupiers in difficulties wish to stay
in their homes as assured tenants. This will add to the impact of the
measures I announced in December to help the housing market.
But I have also looked closely at the entire rationale behind the Business
Expansion Scheme, which is an exceptionally generous tax relief. When my Rt
Honourable Friend the Member for Surrey East introduced it in 1983, the
venture capital industry was in its infancy, and there was concern that the
investment needs of small firms were not well understood and provided for.
The BES has been extremely successful. Over Pounds 2bn has been raised and
invested in qualifying schemes of all kinds. And Britain now has a venture
capital industry the equal of that anywhere in the world, outside the US.
But the provisions of the Business Expansion Scheme have become ever more
complex. And nowadays only a small part of the total invested goes to small
businesses.
As my Rt Honourable Friend the Member for Blaby made clear when they were
introduced, the BES provisions for assured tenancies were intended to expire
at the end of 1993. I have decided that it is unnecessary to continue the
Business Expansion Scheme beyond that date, not only for assured tenancies,
but for other investments as well. BES will therefore come to an end on
December 31 1993. As I have said, it has fulfilled a useful purpose. But its
removal will significantly improve the neutrality of the tax system. And
some 45 pages of complex legislation will be removed from the statute book.
As a result of my announcement today, there is likely to be some
acceleration in investment, which will be welcome. In the long run there
will be a substantial saving, perhaps Pounds 130m a year.
Last year, I made it clear that I was concerned about the position of the
British film industry and that I would consider carefully any further
proposals that the industry brought forward. I have done so. Although a
special tax regime already exists, the industry has long argued that the
provisions for writing off expenditure do not fully take account of their
special circumstances, and in particular of the cashflow problems that may
be caused by the sometimes lengthy gap between the completion of a film and
its release. I propose two measures to alleviate the position.
First, relief for pre-production expenditure will be available as it is
incurred. And second, production expenditure will be available for write off
at a fixed rate of one third each year, on a straight-line basis, starting
immediately on the completion of the film. This will have a cost of about
Pounds 5m in the first year, and around Pounds 15m in 1993-94.
Cars
Mr Deputy Speaker, the motor industry is and will remain at the heart of
British manufacturing.
Facing a sharp fall in domestic demand over the last year, the industry
responded in exactly the right way, by switching production to exports,
which rose by 20 per cent in 1991. The fall in domestic sales should not be
allowed to obscure this growing strength, which should make Britain a net
exporter of cars by 1996 for the first time since 1974.
Nonetheless I recognise that the last year has been a difficult one, and the
measures I am proposing today will help the industry, while building on and
continuing the reform of the taxation of cars that I and my predecessors
have introduced.
Before the 1988 Budget, the car scale charges - the income tax charge on
those who have the benefit of a company car - were too low. Since then, we
have moved much closer to realistic levels. I propose this year to increase
the scale charges only in line with inflation. Otherwise, the real value of
the tax payable would fall.
But there are still aspects of the car scale charges which are both
arbitrary and unfair. For most cars the tax payable is determined not by
reference to the value of the car but rather by the car's engine size. As
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission has pointed out, this causes
distortions. It also discriminates against diesel cars. The unfairness in
the current system may have been acceptable when the tax charge was only a
fraction of the true value to the user, but that is no longer the case.
We need a system that better measures the value of the benefit. That means
basing the tax charge on the price of the car, not its engine size. I
therefore propose to introduce price-based scales as soon as practicable.
The Inland Revenue will be publishing a consultative document in the summer
on the details and timing of such a move.
The car fuel scales, which measure the taxable benefit of free private fuel
provided by the employer, have remained frozen since 1987. I propose to
increase the scale for free petrol by 4.5 per cent. But at the moment, we
apply the same charge to diesel as to petrol, even though the cash value of
free diesel is less. That means the fuel scales are too high for diesel
cars. So I propose to introduce a new, and significantly lower, scale for
diesel, bringing the tax charge closer into line with the value of the
benefit received.
While the income tax treatment of cars has until recent years been much too
generous, in other ways cars have been the subject of discriminatory tax
treatment. I have some changes to announce that will reduce that
discrimination, and provide a boost for all businesses buying cars and for
the car industry itself.
First, companies that offered their employees the alternative of cash or a
car have found themselves liable to pay VAT on the salary forgone by those
who chose the car. That is clearly nonsensical. I shall be laying an order
to make clear beyond doubt that from April 1 a VAT charge will no longer be
imposed in these so-called salary-sacrifice cases.
Second, the capital allowances available for business cars are currently
restricted for cars costing more than Pounds 8,000. This limit is now
unrealistically low and I propose to increase it to Pounds 12,000, enabling
full capital allowances to be given on most business cars. This measure will
cost Pounds 50m in 1993-94, building up to Pounds 220m when the change has
its maximum effect. But the revenue cost in the long term will be small.
At present, most taxi and car hire firms and driving schools cannot recover
the VAT they pay on their cars even though their cars are their businesses.
I propose to end this anomaly from August 1, at a cost of Pounds 50m in
1992-93.
These measures will go some way towards improving the neutrality of the tax
system as it affects cars purchased by businesses. But I have one further
measure to announce, which will affect all those buying new cars.
In 1973 car tax was introduced, to make up the difference between VAT and
the former purchase tax. It has remained unchanged at 10 per cent of the
wholesale price ever since. This tax distorts consumer spending, and car
manufacturers have long complained that our taxes on new cars are higher
than those of other main European producers.
This government has always sought to reduce distortions in the tax system,
and I therefore propose to reduce car tax by half, to 5 per cent, from
midnight tonight. This will directly reduce the tax burden on all new cars.
I trust that car dealers will respond by passing the full benefit of this
reduction - about Pounds 400 on a typical family car - to the buyer. The
halving of car tax will cost about Pounds 635m in 1992-93, and Pounds 765m
in the following year.
Excise Duties
I turn now to excise duties. Last year I raised the duties on alcohol in
line with inflation, and I propose to do the same this year. From 6.00pm
tonight, this will mean an increase in the tax on a typical pint of beer of
just over 1p, just under 5p on a bottle of wine and 28p on a bottle of
spirits. I also propose to raise the duty on unleaded petrol and on diesel
in line with inflation.
On leaded petrol, I propose a rather larger increase, of 7 1/2 per cent,
taking the tax differential between leaded and unleaded petrol to over 5
pence a litre. This will continue our long-standing and successful policy of
encouraging motorists to move away from leaded petrol, which now represents
little more than half the market.
I propose to increase vehicle excise duty on cars, taxis and light vans, by
Pounds 10, and to freeze it again this year for lorries.
I propose to raise the duty on tobacco by about 10 per cent - roughly the
same real increase as last year. That will add 13p to the price of a packet
of 20. The duties on other tobacco products will also rise by about 10 per
cent, apart from that on pipe tobacco which will rise only in line with
inflation. Benjamin Franklin once said that nothing was certain except death
and taxes. But for some people, the latter can help to delay the former. As
for the irreconcilables - amongst whom I count myself - I have one minor
compensation. I propose to abolish from January 1 1993 the duty charged on
matches and mechanical lighters.
I also have a change to announce on betting duty, with consequences for the
racing industry. I propose to cut the rate of betting duty by  1/4 per cent,
reducing the tax take by Pounds 15m in 1992-93. My Rt Honourable Friend the
home secretary will be announcing later today his determination of the horse
race betting levy and he will be making proposals to ensure that the greater
part of this reduction will be channelled to the horse racing industry. That
is an important part of this measure. I shall review the cut in betting duty
next year.
A proportion of the reduction, of course, will be attributable to betting on
greyhound racing. I hope that voluntary arrangements can be found to direct
some of this money to help the greyhound racing industry, and my Rt
Honourable Friend will be exploring the possibilities with interested
parties.
I should also tell honourable members quite clearly what I am not doing. I
know that there is particular concern about the European Commission's
proposals on the taxation of alcohol. But let me make it clear - I will not
accept any deal in Brussels that would ride roughshod over the interests of
the British cider industry. Nor will I accept a deal that would allow other
member states to continue to levy no excise duty on wine which they make,
but forces them to put up duties on spirits which we make.
Charities
Over the past 13 years, we have introduced a number of measures directed at
encouraging charitable giving. We introduced the payroll giving scheme. We
have extended and widened VAT reliefs. And my Rt Honourable Friend the prime
minister, when he was chancellor, introduced the gift aid scheme.
Gift aid allows tax relief on one-off donations of Pounds 600 or more. And
it has been a considerable success - charities have received nearly Pounds
200m in income under the scheme.
I propose that from July 1 1992 the minimum gift should be reduced to Pounds
400, the figure proposed by the Council for Charitable Support and the
Charities Tax Reform Group. I shall not go further, because I know that some
charities are concerned that to do so might reduce the attraction of regular
giving through charitable covenants.
But I propose some changes to the arrangements for tax relief on charitable
covenants, intended to reduce administration costs for charities and help
them to maintain a steady and reliable flow of income. And I propose a
number of minor improvements to the VAT reliefs available to charities and
for aids to the disabled.
Savings
Mr Deputy Speaker, savings are a passport to personal independence and
security; the very foundation of a property-owning democracy. That is why
over the last decade this government has set out to lighten the burden of
taxation on saving.
We have reduced the basic and higher rates of income tax, and abolished the
investment income surcharge. We have stopped taxing the savings of
non-taxpayers. And we have extended savings incentives to the mass of
ordinary taxpaying savers by introducing TESSAs, which allow people to
invest up to Pounds 9,000 over five years in a bank or building society
account.
We have also introduced new and popular incentives to invest in shares. In
1986 we introduced PEPs, to enhance the attraction of investment in shares,
by making the income and capital gains from them free of tax. Today I want
to improve PEPs still further, by removing the Pounds 3,000 limit on the
amount that can be invested in unit or investment trusts. I propose that
from April people should be able to invest up to the full Pounds 6,000 a
year in qualifying investment and unit trusts. This new opportunity - which
will cost Pounds 10m in 1993-94 - will provide further encouragement to
PEPs, and help to small savers.
We do not see the returns to savings as 'unearned income', to be taxed more
heavily than earned income. On the contrary, we will continue to lighten the
burden of tax on savings, and to broaden the range of investments which
receive savings incentives.
Pensioners
No one has benefited more from our encouragement of savings than pensioners.
In the 1980s, most pensioners saw their real incomes rise sharply, as
inflation fell and the value of occupational pensions rose. On average,
pensioners' real incomes increased by more than a third between 1979 and
1988. More than half of pensioners now have a second pension; and pensioners
have seen their income from saving double since 1979.
I propose that the income tax allowances for the over-65s - both the
personal allowances and the married couple's allowances - should increase in
line with inflation. The income limit for the age-related allowances will
also increase in line with inflation.
Increases in the age allowances can of course only benefit those pensioners
who pay tax. But this year I also want to help the less fortunate pensioners
 -those whose savings have been eroded over the years by inflation; those
who have only modest occupational pensions; and those who retired too early
to take advantage of the growth of SERPS.
Last October my Rt Honourable Friend the secretary of state for social
security announced that income support rates for pensioners would be
increased this April by at least 7 per cent. And there were extra increases
for disabled pensioners and the over 80s.
I now propose a further increase in income support rates, of Pounds 2 for
single pensioners and Pounds 3 for pensioner couples. When this comes into
effect, in October, all pensioners on income support will be at least Pounds
5.75 a week better off than they are now, and some will be as much as Pounds
10.70 a week better off. In total, some 5m people will benefit. And it will
bring the real increase in spending on benefits for poorer pensioners since
1989 to more than Pounds 700m.
The cost, some Pounds 145m in 1992-93, and Pounds 305m in the following
year, will be financed from within the existing public expenditure plans.
Income tax
Turning now to income tax more generally, I do not propose this year to
increase the basic rate limit, the level of taxable income above which
people begin to pay higher rate tax. Compared with indexation this will save
Pounds 180m in 1992-93 and Pounds 290m the following year.
Nor do I propose any increase in the married couple's allowance for couples
under 65 or the allowances that are linked to it. But I do have one
significant change to announce. The introduction of independent taxation in
1990 brought privacy and independence to married women, by ending the rule
that a wife's income was assumed to be her husband's. This change was widely
welcomed. However, it did not eliminate completely the discriminatory
features of the old system.
At present the husband receives the benefit of the married couple's
allowance unless his income is too low to make use of it. That means that
the husband's tax allowances are almost always greater than those of his
wife. It also means that couples where the wife is a higher rate taxpayer
and the husband is not pay more tax than couples where the husband is the
higher rate taxpayer. This cannot be right. It is hardly surprising that the
MCA has been described by some working women as the Male Chauvinist
Allowance.
I propose to change this system. From 1993-94, couples will have a choice.
If they take no action, the husband will continue to receive the MCA as now.
They will be able to decide that the wife should receive the whole
allowance, or that they should split it. Or the wife will be able to claim
half at her own request. This measure will have only a small effect on
revenue - Pounds 10m in 1993-94 - but it will make the tax system much
fairer to married women.
Mr Deputy Speaker, this Government has cut the basic rate of income tax by
eight pence since we took office in 1979, to 25 pence. And, as the House
knows, we are committed to reducing the basic rate to 20 pence, as and when
it is prudent to do so. I reaffirm that commitment today.
For the year ahead, I propose that the personal allowance should be uprated
only in line with inflation. It will rise from Pounds 3,295 to Pounds 3,445.
But having reflected carefully on the priorities for this year's Budget, I
have decided that for the year ahead it is right to leave the basic rate at
25 pence in the pound.
But, Mr Deputy Speaker, I do believe that it is possible, desirable and
indeed prudent to take a substantial step this year towards our goal of a 20
pence basic rate, for all taxpayers.
It is neither necessary or desirable that anyone earning more than their
personal allowances should start paying income tax at a rate of 25 per cent.
With national insurance contributions on top that means that the government
takes a third of every extra Pounds 1 earned even from the low paid. In my
view that is simply too much; and I believe that we can and should reduce
that burden.
So I propose this year to cut the rate of income tax by five pence, to 20
pence, for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. This will benefit every
taxpayer in the country. But it will be of proportionately greater benefit
to those on low incomes; and it represents a decisive first step towards the
government's objective of a 20 pence basic rate.
In the next parliament we will gradually move closer to that goal. We will
be able to do this in two possible ways: either by extending the width of
the 20 pence band, so that it covers increasing numbers of basic rate
taxpayers, or by reducing the basic rate itself.
But next year nearly 4m people on low incomes will already be paying tax
only at the 20p rate. Their income tax bill will be cut by a fifth. That
will improve their work incentives and make it more worthwhile for those not
currently in work to take lower paid jobs.
And nearly 25m people - every taxpayer in the country - will see their
starting rate of tax reduced to 20 pence. Combined with the indexation of
the personal allowance, this will reduce taxes for the large majority of
taxpayers by at least Pounds 2.64 a week.
Mortgage interest tax relief at source will continue to be given at 25 per
cent for everybody, irrespective of whether they are a non-taxpayer, a 20p
taxpayer, a basic rate taxpayer, or a higher rate taxpayer. But those in the
20 pence band will only be liable for tax at 20 per cent on their savings.
The new 20 pence band will cost Pounds 1.8bn in 1992-93 and Pounds 2.3 bn in
the following year, broadly equivalent to the cost of a penny off the basic
rate. But, in comparison with a penny off the basic rate, the 20p band will
be of particular benefit to those on the lowest incomes. Indeed, about
three-quarters of the cost will go to taxpayers earning less than average
male earnings.
I now turn to value added tax. I have a very important announcement to make,
to which I hope the whole House will listen carefully. I have no need, no
proposals and no plans either to raise or to extend the scope of VAT.
Mr Deputy Speaker, the total impact of the taxation proposals I have put
forward today, taken together with measures announced since my last Budget,
will reduce the burden of taxation by around Pounds 1.5bn, equivalent to
1/4 per cent of GDP, in the next financial year.
Peroration
The Budget I have presented today is a Budget for the recovery. It maintains
the policies that have slashed inflation and reduced interest rates. And it
includes measures that will help businesses, large and small, up and down
the country.
But it is also a Budget that cuts taxes for every taxpayer in the country. A
Budget which marks another significant step in our constant drive to leave
individuals and families with more of what they earn. Over the last decade
our belief in low taxation has brought unparalleled growth in the living
standards of the British people. My Budget today continues that process, and
I commend it to the House.'

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): PSBR depresses market - Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE GILT market got the worst of both worlds from the Budget - a higher
public sector borrowing requirement which it did not want, without the
necessary tax cuts to win the general election,' said Mr Chris Dillow,
economist at Nomura International.
The UK gilt-edged securities market plummeted yesterday afternoon as it
digested news of the government's heavy borrowing requirement. Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, forecast a public sector borrowing requirement of
Pounds 28bn for 1992-93, whereas most City economists have been predicting a
PSBR of between Pounds 22bn to Pounds 25bn.
Mr John Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds, said: 'You are talking
about gross gilt issuance of about Pounds 33bn in the next year once gilt
redemptions are taken into consideration.' This means that the Bank of
England will have to sell an average of nearly Pounds 3bn of gilts a month,
compared with an average of Pounds 1.3bn a month over the past year.
Mr Kendall believes that the market should have no problem digesting gilt
issues of about Pounds 3bn a month once the current political uncertainty is
over. He added that the inflation forecasts - of below 4 per cent by the end
of 1992 for the RPI and of 3.5 per cent by the middle of next year - are
positive for the UK government bond market.
The Bank announced yesterday that it would continue to use its entire range
of issuing techniques in order to sell gilts. It has raised the size of its
gilts auctions to between Pounds 2bn-Pounds 3bn (from Pounds 1bn-Pounds 2bn)
and said it may hold even bigger auctions 'if market conditions warrant' to
sell government bonds. The Bank said that the auction programme is likely to
account for 'rather more than half of the total gilt funding requirement'.
Economists and traders said the gilt market's reaction to the PSBR forecasts
probably would not have been so negative if the chancellor had announced
more attractive tax cuts to boost the government's chances of winning the
election.
Mr John Shepperd, director of sterling bond research at SG Warburg
Securities, said: 'The gilt market got the costs without the benefit of any
political kickbacks.'

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Tea but little sympathy for Lamont - Paul
Cheeseright hears the views of a group of professional women
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first titter came even before the tea was poured. The chancellor's
promise of 'a Budget for recovery' set it off. The first laugh came when he
laid the ground for raising the government's borrowing.
Incredulity came with the second cup. That was when Mr Lamont began to talk
of investment in infrastructure. But the only surprise was his method of
providing an income tax break.
Seven professional women met in Birmingham to listen to the chancellor.
Seven professional women left for home distinctly unimpressed. The cake from
the baker tasted better than the offering from London.
They felt there was little to enhance the immediate possibility of economic
recovery. They were more ambivalent about whether Mr Lamont had produced a
vote winner, although they could see him casting seed on the electoral
waters.
'It'll be attractive to the marginal voters, it will win them the election,'
stated Jo James, consultant anaesthetist at East Birmingham Hospital. Linda
Comfort, director of Allied Provincial Securities, asserted the opposite.
Madeleine Simms, who runs her own urban regeneration consultancy, said: 'I'm
not certain people will be voting with their pockets. They're thinking
wider.'
'It's not pushed the Conservatives one way or the other,' said Sandra
Nutley, lecturer in public sector management at Aston Business School.
Catriona McFadden, public relations manager at Birmingham's Hyatt Regency
hotel concluded that people would 'just say 'well, eh?''.
'It will be an easily attackable Budget,' predicted Jane Skinner, chief
executive of Birmingham Settlement, a long-established city charity.
If Norman Lamont is to be on the end of an offensive from Labour and the
Liberal Democrats, suggested Anne Avian, manager of the Sandwell Chamber of
Commerce, it will be because 'it's terribly depressing.'
None of the women disagreed because, in the West Midlands, the crucially
dependent motor industry is suffering, there are few signs of any end to
urban poverty and because, in Birmingham and the Black Country, nearly half
those in work are on wages designated as low pay by the Low Pay Unit.
Ms Skinner noted that the income tax relief 'would be noticeable in a small
pay packet', but Ms Simms believed 'it's daft to give it to everybody - we
(that is the relatively well-paid) wouldn't notice'.
The fact that there was nothing in the Budget to assist with child care or
help those caring for the elderly was worrying - as was the absence of
measures to encourage training.
'It's a traditional Budget. If you're earning well, there's something in it
for you,' said Ms Skinner. Ms Simms added: 'But there's no help to women
coming back into the labour force,' while Ms Comfort observed: 'A lot of
women will be put off having children this year.'
'I personally didn't want to be made any better off,' said Ms Nutley,
expressing what was a general lack of interest in the moves about
inheritance tax. Rather the women would have preferred the chancellor to
have spent his ingenuity on looking at help for industry and urban social
and economic problems.
Certainly, said Ms Avian, he had not gone far enough in reducing car tax to
5 per cent. 'It is hardly here or there. The West Midlands car industry will
lose 40,000 people this year.' Nor, she added were there any incentives for
start-up businesses.
Capital raising for small business worried Ms Comfort. 'The venture capital
industry will not be prepared to fill the gap left by (the abolition of) the
Business Expansion Scheme. It's not interested in the small business end.'
'If you consider the withdrawal of the banks from the inner cities, this
means there is an inner city (financing) gap of growing proportions,' chimed
in Ms Skinner.
Local authorities, of course, have been wrestling with the problems of
unpaid poll tax from the inner city areas. Now, with the changes in the
uniform business rate Ms Nutley predicted they will have further cashflow
headaches. 'Mr Lamont said he would top up the business rate pool, but I'm
suspicious - what are the implications for the long term?' she asked,
hinting at a further erosion of local authority powers.
Against the background of rising unemployment and homelessness, the women
felt the chancellor should have done more to stem the tide of repossessions.
He should also have allowed local authorities greater freedom to use their
capital receipts from council house sales.
The women wondered about the sharp rise in the public sector borrowing
requirement. Where was it going, they asked, and responded with their own
answer - to fund a higher level of unemployment.
They could find some good in the smaller elements of the Budget - the
administrative changes on VAT, for example. But the only thing they really
agreed on was that it made sense to bring the government's spending and
income statements together in December 1993. It was scant praise for a
putative election-winning Budget.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Smith sees his wardrobe stolen - Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MORE than a few moments there was a distinct impression of dither from
the Labour Party. It had always expected the Budget to be a clothes'
stealing exercise, but few calculated that Mr Norman Lamont had his eye on
most of the wardrobe.
What is more, Mr Neil Kinnock's response to the speech appeared to be the
script prepared for the widely-expected 1p cut in the 25p basic income tax
rate.
His repeated attacks on 'borrowing for tax cuts' appeared to pre-empt any
inclination Mr John Smith, his shadow chancellor may have had to swallow
hard and accept the proposed new 20p tax band.
Some suspected that Mr Smith's furrowed brow suggested he would have
preferred a little more time to consider. Yet within the hour it was clear
Labour would reject the reduced rate tax band.
Once the 'line' was established, it was distributed freely and vigorously
around the lobbies and corridors. 'It is an incredibly defensive budget -
designed to stuff Labour and not to sell themselves to the electorate. A big
error,' was one party official's verdict.
Another underlined that the Tories had priced votes at 'a miserable Pounds 2
a week.'
Yet privately some Labour MPs conceded that the package had 'muddied the
waters.' One frontbencher described it as 'an incompetent bribe.' But it was
a bribe nonetheless.
From his very first sentences, Mr Lamont made clear that he would be
borrowing liberally from Labour's programme. The merger of the annual autumn
statement on public expenditure with the Budget was just the beginning.
The concept of the 'budget for recovery', the increases on pensions (though
only for those on income support) and the scrapping of the Business
Expansion Scheme had distinct echoes of Mr Smith's carefully worded
pre-budget utterances.
As Labour's economic backroom boys work over the figures for their
alternative budget - due next Tuesday - the short-term task was to expose
the Tory 'bribe', disparage it and prepare a glittering shop window of
public spending pledges in a package wrapped in the language of prudence.
In headline terms, however, the options are limited. Labour's figures say
its revenue raising measures - higher top tax rates and an end to the
ceiling on National Insurance contributions - will bring it Pounds 3.85bn.
These broadly cover its plans to raise Child Benefit and lift pensions by
Pounds 5 for a single person and Pounds 8 for a couple and to fund the bulk
of a Pounds 1.1bn recovery programme including measures for training,
employment creation and tax breaks for industrial investment.
But some optimistic hopes of a very large windfall for public expenditure
have had to be tempered. The new tax band is costed at Pounds 1.8bn in the
1992-3 tax year. Labour must now maximise the use of that limited money to
better its electoral hopes by carefully targetted new spending.
Mr Smith's team have always been careful not to rule out the possibility
that some of this sum may be needed to adjust its tax raising plans.
As the midnight oil burns in the shadow chancellor's office, his team will
not forget the opinion poll conundrum that shows voters' opting for public
spending above tax cuts - but then adding that, on reflection, they would
rather like the money.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Chancellor signals start of unified
bulletin - Statements Change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont yesterday rose uniquely to the occasion of the Budget
ceremony by announcing that, after next year, the ceremony will cease to
exist.
The chancellor said that the time-honoured exercise of dealing with taxation
and spending in two separate government statements will be replaced by a
unified annual budget.
Sounding the death knell for well over a century of British economic
tradition, Mr Lamont said the first overall fiscal statement combining tax
and spending would come in December 1993. This would bring together in a
single form the decisions at present dealt with separately in the March
Budget and a November Autumn Statement.
Rather like the switch to decimal coinage in 1971, the move ends an
endearingly arcane British custom and brings the UK into line with most
industrialised and developing countries. Since Mr John Smith, the shadow
chancellor, has also promised to end the separation of tax and expenditure
decisions, yesterday's announcement appears final.
Although, after 1993, Budget Day may never be the same, the Treasury
yesterday brushed aside any idea that the whole procedure would be scrapped.
The wooden Budget box bearing Queen Victoria's monogram in gold letters -
which dates from Gladstone's day - looks likely to remain an essential
accompaniment.
'A lot of the trappings will be the same. Whoever he is, the chancellor will
want to have his big day,' the Treasury said.
The decision, which has been under active discussion within the Treasury for
more than a year, is intended to improve policy presentation and improve
decision-making.
The present system was first set down by Sir Robert Walpole in the 18th
century, and refined by Gladstone in 1860.
Mr Lamont said it was not only 'illogical' but also had 'undesirable
consequences'. Separation of tax proposals from expenditure had contributed
to Britain's 'excessively complex tax system'.
Momentum towards ending the practice has been building up since it was
criticised in the early 1980s by the Armstrong committee on budgetary reform
and by the Treasury and the Civil Service Committee.
The move was given a warm welcome yesterday in the City. Bringing together
the two halves of fiscal policy was termed 'eminently sensible' by Mr Nigel
Richardson, an economist at merchant bankers SG Warburg.
Under Mr Lamont's proposals, the annual December fiscal statement would
contain tax plans for the coming fiscal year as well as expenditure plans
for the three years ahead.
The date of the annual Finance Bill would be brought forward from April to
January.

deep disappointment that there was no help for them, though the measures
were welcomed by small businesses and car manufacturers.
Computer manufacturers and software suppliers complained that the Budget had
done nothing to unlock capital spending by industry and commerce. Retailers,
however, were pleased by moves to ease the burden of the uniform business
rate.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, a large contractor and Britain's
second largest housebuilder, said: 'The chancellor appears to have a higher
regard for car dealers, bookmakers and film producers than he does for a
construction industry suffering from the worst recession for half a
century.'
Mr John Gardner, managing director of ICL (UK), the UK-based computer
manufacturer 80 per cent owned by Fujitsu, said: 'As the managing director
of a large company it did little for me. There were no real measures to help
break the capital expenditure block; nothing to encourage large companies to
spend more money.'
Glaxo, the UK's largest company by market capitalisation, said it would be
hardly affected by the budget. Most of the company's sales were outside the
UK; it therefore welcomed the prospect of changes to advance corporation tax
for big overseas earners. Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN and the CBI's
economic and financial policy group, described the budget as 'prudent'.
He said the main reforms, the tax cut, changes to the uniform rate and the
halving of the tax on cars to 5 per cent, would only cost an estimated
Pounds 1.5bn compared with the CBI's call for Pounds 1.7bn of spending. 'It
was a remarkably smart budget; the tax cuts were progressive rather than
regressive.'
Many engineering and manufacturing companies were bitter that there were no
measures to stimulate investment. Industry leaders in particular were upset
at Mr Lamont's failure to increase capital allowances, though there was some
praise for the reduction in special car tax. Mr Mike Bright, chairman of FMT
Holdings, the Brighton-based machine toolmaker, queried the rationale for
write-offs of film costs over three years on a straight line basis without
considering similar concessions on special projects for manufacturing
industry.
Sir Allen Shepherd, chairman of Grand Metropolitan, said the chancellor got
the Budget 'about right both politically and economically'. He described the
5p reduction in income tax to 20p for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable
income as 'politically clever'.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI, said the halving of car tax was
helpful - the motor industry provides up to 7 per cent of chemical industry
sales. Small businesses welcomed moves to prevent large customers delaying
payments to their smaller suppliers and contractors, and the decision to
remove most family-owned businesses from the inheritance tax net.
Mr Barry Baldwin, economic adviser to the Union of Independent Companies,
said: 'The greatest thing in this Budget is the encouragement to the owners
of independent businesses that they can keep their companies intact.'
Mr Neil Arnold, regional chief of the North Eastern Co-operative Society,
said moves to restrain the impact of the uniform business rate would
encourage further retail developments.

NATWEST BANK
Score: 7 out of 10
MR LAMONT scores a good mark because he met some important political and
economic requirements.
His room for manoeuvre was much less than assumed because his tax receipts
were much less because of the recession. He announced a very high PSBR in a
manner which is prudent. He managed to administer stimulus to demand without
unsettling the financial markets. Only mild criticism was that he didn't
announce more direct tax relief for the company sector.
ROGER BOOTLE - MIDLAND MONTAGU
Score: 6 out of 10
THE overwhelming influence on the Budget was the sharp deterioration in
public finances which itself was due primarily to the continued recession.
Given that he has only been able to give a small net tax reduction of Pounds
1.5bn, the chancellor has used his money imaginatively. The Budget is well
balanced with significant help for small businesses and a reduction in tax
for individuals. The new 20p band is very well judged from a political
viewpoint. It will be difficult for Labour to respond.
KEVIN GARDINER - SG WARBURG SECURITIES
Score: 4 out of 10
THE chancellor was neither bold nor coherent. It was rather a mishmash. The
score was low because of the 'poor' state of public-sector accounts. The
prospective borrowing situation is significantly worse than expected, and
there is a very large government deficit emerging with a tax package smaller
than expected. Expectations for economic recovery have been halved in scale
and effectively postponed by a year. He should have been more upbeat in
commitment to the ERM.
BILL MARTIN - UBS PHILLIPS &amp; DREW
Score: 1 out of 10
THE budget will not act as a significant stimulus to the economy.
The budget deficit is almost certainly out of control.
The tax cuts are rather parsimonious.
They were certainly less than the market had been expecting.
Most people would expect the tax cuts to be short-lived.
Mr Lamont would be lucky to see growth at half the rates he had forecast.
Prospects for inflation remain good, but prospects for activity remain grim.
PETER SPENCER - SHEARSON LEHMAN
Score: 7 out of 10
IT was disappointing. Mr Lamont showed some clever card play, but his hand
was worse than had been thought, and he failed to produce the
election-winning trick everyone thought he had up his sleeve. I am afraid
the cupboard is simply bare, and Mr Lamont is in the unenviable position of
being placed in the role of Old Mother Hubbard.
He had promised an economic recovery, 20 per cent tax rate, and entry into
the narrow band of the ERM, but had done little towards fulfilling his
promises.
GAVYN DAVIES - GOLDMAN SACHS
Score: 6 out of 10
IT falls between every conceivable stool. It does not put Labour on the spot
and it does not transform the Conservatives' electoral position. It also
does not seem likely to bring interest rates down, although the government
could still be saved by Spain or Belgium cutting their rates in the next few
days.
He made a virtue of not kickstarting the economy, but I think that is just
what is needed. The Treasury clearly thinks the recovery is already under
way, but that judgment is highly questionable.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Ending scheme may cut funds to small
companies - BES
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIERS involved in the Business Expansion Scheme believe its abolition
of the scheme at the end of 1993 will lead to a big upsurge in demand in the
meantime.
Many leading figures in the industry were delighted that the scheme had been
extended for two more tax years, but some said its abolition would cut off a
source of funds for small companies.
Mr Tim Villiers, chief executive of the BES Association, condemned the move
as 'throwing out the baby with the bathwater'.
He added: 'I think it's astonishing to cut out private investors completely
in an area where corporate investors have been so reluctant to come forward.
The venture capital industry does not meet the needs of the companies the
BES has catered for.'
But Mr Charles Fry, chairman of Johnson Fry, which leads the market in
raising BES funds, was delighted by the news, which he said made the
position clear for all parties. 'I welcome what the chancellor's done; it
makes a lot of sense, and we look forward to the next 18 months and raising
a lot more money.'
He predicted a 'double whammy' sales 'bonanza' for next year, caused by a
rush to take advantage of tax incentives at the end of the 1992-93 tax year
and at the end of December 1993.
The BES gives tax relief on investments of up to Pounds 40,000 per year, at
the top marginal rate of tax, provided they are held for five years.
There was relief that the chancellor had taken no measures to outlaw
'assured exit' BES schemes. These substantially cut the risk involved by
buying rental accommodation for colleges or housing associations, in return
for a promise to buy back the property after a fixed period of five years.
BES tax relief has allowed sponsors to offer massive returns.
Last year, such schemes accounted for 75 per cent of the total Pounds 255m
raised by the scheme - up from Pounds 165m the previous year. Mr Anthony
Yadgaroff, a BES analyst with the Allenbridge Group, said funds raised so
far in the current tax year amounted to Pounds 280m, of which Pounds 235m
had gone to 'assured exit' schemes.
Two of these schemes raised money for 'mortgage rescue' schemes, which buy
houses which would otherwise be repossessed and rent them to the previous
owners. These involved awkward legal arrangements, as BES companies were not
allowed to buy properties where the tenant was known in advance. The
Chancellor's decision to remove this rule was greeted by sponsors as a great
aid to marketing.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Big boost in government investment will
help hesitant upturn - Treasury Forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HESITANT economic upturn in the final half of this year, helped by a large
boost in government investment, was predicted by the Treasury in forecasts
released with the Budget.
The predictions indicate much higher than expected government borrowing over
the next two years, partly resulting from limited growth in tax income
caused by the recession and higher state spending in such areas as social
security benefits.
One factor behind the forecasts is a sharply more pessimistic outlook for
the world economy than that contained in the Treasury's predictions in
November's Autumn Statement.
Nonetheless, the Treasury insisted that the main ingredients for recovery
from the 18-month recession were in place. These are 'lower interest rates,
falling inflation and the fiscal stabilisers (the effects of increased
government spending boosting the economy)'.
According to Mr Norman Lamont UK gross domestic product will increase by 1
per cent this year, a figure at the low end of predictions by private-sector
economists. It contrasts with the Treasury's more bullish projection for
next year of 2.25 per cent, made in November.
Consumer spending, which accounts for about two thirds of GDP, is expected
to rise by a weak 1 per cent, while growth in manufacturing will be just 0.5
per cent, after a drop of more than 5 per cent in 1991.
The economy is expected to benefit from a sharp rise in government
investment, likely to increase by 10.75 per cent neat year, after a 9.25 per
cent fall last year.
According to the Treasury, government investment this year is likely to be
24 per cent higher than in 1988 and 50 per cent up on 1979. But business
investment is predicted to fall by 2.75 per cent this year, after a 11.75
per cent drop on last year.
The Treasury said the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) would be
Pounds 28bn in the fiscal year beginning on April 1, after Pounds 13.75bn in
1991-92. In 1993-94, it is likely to rise still more to Pounds 32bn, or 4.75
per cent of gross domestic product and to fall to Pounds 25bn in 1994-95.
Between 1991-92 and 1992-93, general government income including income tax
and corporation tax is predicted to rise by just Pounds 8bn, from Pounds
222bn to Pounds 230bn. Over the same period government spending is likely to
climb Pounds 22bn from Pounds 236bn to Pounds 258bn.
The Treasury said that growth in the seven biggest industrialised economies
 -the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - would be just
1.5 per cent this year, with world trade rising by 3.75 per cent. The Autumn
Statement put these figures at 2.5 per cent and 6 per cent respectively.
On the expected recovery in the UK, the Treasury said this will be held back
by a weak housing market, high levels of consumer debt, and only a slight
reduction in savings as a percentage of disposable income. This expected to
fall by just 0.5 of a percentage point over the next 12 months, from 10 per
cent to 9.5 per cent.
The Treasury says GDP in the first half of this year will show virtually no
increase on the same period last year, but in the second half the economy
will have expanded by 2 per cent compared with last time. It foresees 3 per
cent growth between the first halves of this year and next.
Many economists will take the projections with a pinch of salt. The message
that the recovery is coming, but has been delayed, is very similar to the
tone of the Treasury's Autumn Statement and Budget 1991 forecasts, both of
which turned out to be inaccurate.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Duty increases expected to hit sales -
Alcohol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASES in duty on spirits, wine and beer provoked disappointment and
anger in the drinks industry.
The increases - adding 28p to the retail price of a bottle of spirits, 5p to
a bottle of wine and more than 1p to a pint of beer - would do nothing to
reverse declining sales at home, said industry leaders.
The chancellor's move also widened the tax gap between the UK and other EC
member states instead of moving towards a harmonisation of rates in
preparation for the advent of the single market next year.
Mr David Jenkins, chairman of the Wines and Spirits Association, said,
'There is not even a gesture towards harmonisation. The much lower taxes on
spirits and wine in France will encourage more people to hop on a ferry to
buy their drinks across the Channel.
'From January next year they will be allowed to bring back nine cases of
wine and a case of spirits. Even if the customs manage to prevent
bootlegging, it is going to have a damaging effect on the trade in the UK.'
One driver could bring back a year's average supply of wine and spirits for
four people, he estimated.
UK excise on spirits was nearly five times that in Spain and Portugal, two
and half times that in France and more than double that in Germany and the
Netherlands.
Denmark, in contrast to the UK, had started to reduce its tax rates to bring
them closer to the level of most other EC countries.
Mr Anthony Tennant, chairman of Guinness, said he was 'shocked' by the
budget increases on spirits duty. 'It was very curious of the chancellor to
say that he sought to end distortions in the tax system and then add one
more by hitting spirits. This will send all the wrong signals to Europe by
risking a discriminatory tax on spirits.'
Mr Lamont told the Commons that he would not accept any EC proposals for tax
harmonisation that allowed some states to levy no duty on wine but high
duties on spirits.
Mr Tony Hales, chief executive of Allied-Lyons, and Mr Colin Gordon,
president of IDV Europe, the GrandMet drinks division, welcomed that
'positive statement' but said they were discouraged by the chancellor's
increases.
The Scotch Whisky Association, which has been pressing for measures to
prevent any further widening of the tax differential, said: 'The
chancellor's actions send all the wrong signals to Europe and undermine his
negotiating credibility.'
Mr David Coxon, trading director of the Victoria Wine chain, said: 'This
further round of duty rises will hit drinks retailers again'. Over the past
year, customer choice had been pushed down the price scale. 'This budget
will constrain consumer choice.'

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Business leaders see big reductions in
costs - Northern Response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN business leaders last night forecast substantial reductions in
costs, better cashflow and an easing of administrative burdens in the wake
of the Budget.
There was a wide welcome for the speeding of the transitional arrangements
for the uniform business rate (UBR) in the north and Midlands. Sir Ian
Wrigglesworth, northern region CBI vice-chairman, said news that the
deferred reliefs are now to be activated would be welcomed by many northern
companies.
North-west business expects the overall gain from UBR changes eventually to
be worth Pounds 310m over the 1990-94 period.
Sheffield manufacturers expect a 40 per cent fall in business rates over the
next two years.
Mr Simon Sperryn, chief executive of the Manchester chamber, said that by
protecting southern businesses while breaking the link with northern
reductions, 'the Treasury will now pay for the change, as we have urged all
along'.
Mr John Hambidge, director of Sheffield Chamber of Commerce and Industry
said: 'There appears to be a much greater incentive and ability to both
listen and hear in an election year.'
Mr Keith Robinson, director of Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, particularly
welcomed help for the car industry because its membership includes Ford at
Halewood, Vauxhall at Ellesmere Port and Delco Electronics, the General
Motors component maker, at Kirkby.
Like Mr Hambidge, he wanted car tax abolished. 'But half a loaf is better
than none at all, and we'll settle for 5 per cent for now,' he added.
In Leeds, Mr Peter Coles-Johnson, an economist who is secretary of the
combined Yorkshire and Humberside chambers, said there would be widespread
relief that Mr Lamont had not gone for 'a fiscal binge.'
But he warned that ending the recession quickly depended on interest rate
cuts.
All the organisations said the introduction of one Budget statement on tax
and spending a year would ease uncertainty in business planning.
Mr Andrew Toop, of the north-west CBI regional council, said speeding
payment of debts was also fair. 'It's a matter of everyone playing by the
same rules,' he said.
The change in inheritance tax is also going to have a widespread impact.
'About 80 per cent of members are small family businesses,' Mr Robinson
added.
Mr Harry Tuley, managing director of the Scapa textile engineering group and
chairman of the north-west CBI regional council, regretted that more had not
been done to stimulate investment in plant, machinery, education and
training.
He said Mr Lamont's prudence was welcome and small firms would find much
encouragement. Personal tax changes would reassure consumers, whose lack of
confidence had had so much impact on the High Street.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE sunlit conservatory the quiche and dry white wine beckoned, but next
door 200 north-east business people were rooted to the spot for the live
broadcast of Norman Lamont's budget speech.
Amid the drapes and gilt of Wynyard Hall, former mansion of the coal-owning
Londonderrys and now home of Sir John Hall, the MetroCentre developer and a
Thatcherite miner's son, industrialists and finance specialists looked dazed
by a PSBR of Pounds 28bn.
'This is called going for broke,' whispered Sir Ian Wrigglesworth, northern
region CBI vice-chairman.
At the mention of Uniform Business Rate the pens went into overdrive.
Northern businessmen have long regretted that the original UBR plans were
watered down to soften the blow down south.
At 4.15 the first glass of wine was sipped. At 4.20 the afternoon's first
chicken leg met an accountant's teeth.
Just at this moment, Mr Karl Watkin, the outspoken Northern Businessman of
the year watching the budget at his Gateshead company's headquarters, gave
up on it.
"There isn't anything in there for business," said Mr Watkin, chairman of
Crabtree, a printing equipment maker.
At Wynyard Hall the audience chuckled at Mr Lamont's 20p tax threshold
pirouette. 'He's shot the Labour party's goose,' said Sir Ian.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Loophole on rents to be closed - Inland
Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inland Revenue will gain an additional Pounds 230m in the 1992-94 tax
years by closing a loophole allowing companies to defer tax payments on
rents, Andrew Jack writes.
Since the 1970s it has become common for a company to transfer all the
properties from its trading businesses to the control of a specially-created
property investment company.
The company then grants each trading company leases on their properties,
with rents payable at the start of the new tax year. Until now the trading
companies have been able to claim tax relief on rents in one year, and pay
corporation tax against the rental income the following year.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget: Car sales could rise by 70,000, says industry -
New car tax halved to 5 per cent - Car excise duty up to Pounds 110
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CAR sales could jump by about 70,000 a year as a result of yesterday's
Budget which cut the rate of car tax from 10 per cent to 5 per cent, the
motor industry forecast yesterday.
The Budget was warmly welcomed by carmakers and dealers, who have suffered
in the past two years as new vehicle sales have plunged during the
recession.
The halving of special car tax is expected to cut the cost of a Pounds
10,000 family car by about Pounds 400, and will reduce the total tax rate on
new cars (including value added tax) to 22.4 per cent from 27.3 per cent.
Mr Geoffrey Pelling, general manager of the Society of Motor Manufacturers
and Traders, said: 'We welcome the fact that the chancellor has recognised
the importance of the sector and the need to give it a positive boost.'
Last night Ford, the UK new car market leader, signalled the possible start
of another price war by announcing price cuts over and above the cut in
special car tax.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said 'radical action' on the
part of manufacturers and dealers was needed to encourage consumer
confidence. 'The measures the chancellor has proposed are welcome, but we
decided that further action was needed by us to stimulate the new car market
in Britain.'
New car sales last month were 12 per cent lower than in the same month a
year ago and have plunged by 42.4 per cent in the past three years.
Ford had a record loss last year and has suffered a steady erosion of its
market share. It said it was cutting the price of about 30 per cent of its
range. The list price of the Fiesta base model will be cut by 10.5 per cent
while the price of several other Fiesta and Escort models will be cut by
about 3.5 per cent to 4.0 per cent.
Mr William Ebbert, chairman of Vauxhall, said the Budget measures could add
60,000 new car sales in the UK this year. The company raised its forecast
for UK new car sales this year to 1.73m from 1.67m.
In addition to the halving of special car tax, which is effective from
today, other measures were welcomed by carmakers in the most positive Budget
for the motor industry in years. These include:
the raising of company car taxation scale charges only by the rate of
inflation,
the introduction of company car tax scales based on price rather than engine
size 'as soon as practicable', the capital allowances available for business
cars are to be raised from Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 12,000, taxi, car hire
companies and driving schools will be able to recover the VAT they pay on
their cars.
The green lobby and public transport groups reacted with astonishment to
some of the changes, saying they seemed designed to encourage more use of
the roads at the expense of public transport.
The main surprise was the increase to Pounds 110 of vehicle excise duty
which had been Pounds 100 since 1985.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget: Small companies thrown a lifeline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 1BN SWITCH of resources over two years to help ease the burden of
the much-criticised uniform business rate was a central part of the
chancellor's attempt to revive business and rekindle political support among
traditional sympathisers.
In what the Confederation of British Industry described as a 'prudent and
positive' Budget, Mr Norman Lamont directed much of his help towards small
companies.
Within the small-business community, there was a welcome for changes to the
uniform business rate (UBR) and for plans to take most family companies out
of the reach of inheritance tax. The Federation of Small Businesses
described the plans as 'life-boat' measures.
Some of Britain's largest companies also welcomed the package, saying that
aid for smaller businesses would filter through to assist their own
prospects.
Mr Lamont rejected further reductions in corporation tax and resisted calls
from industry for an improvement in capital allowances to boost investment.
The cost of higher allowances, he said, would be much higher than the
resulting level of new investment.
Apart from specific assistance for the hard-pressed motor industry, Mr
Lamont concentrated on measures intended to help as many businesses as
possible.
Industry welcomed the decision that no business properties will face an
increase in the UBR, above the 4.1 per cent rise due next month, although
there was disappointment that the chancellor had rejected calls for a total
freeze.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget: Kinnock lambasts Tory tax 'bribes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK, the opposition leader, said Labour would set out a 'much
better offer' to Britain during the election than the tax 'bribes' announced
by the government, writes Ivor Owen. He said Labour would publish its
alternative Budget next week.
Amid cheers from supporters, Mr Kinnock insisted that the great majority of
the British people wanted jobs, decent public services, an improved health
service, and 'not the bribes the government is offering'.
He was jeered by Tory MPs when he would not say explicitly whether his party
would reject the introduction of a 20p rate of tax for the first Pounds
2,000 of taxable income. But party officials later said Mr Kinnock had
indicated that it would be opposed.
As Conservative MPs proclaimed that the new reduced rate would prove a key
element in an election-winning Budget, Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to
the Treasury, challenged Mr Kinnock to make his stance clear.
Mr Kinnock urged him to await the publication of Labour's alternative
proposals. When Conservatives continued to demand a detailed answer, the
Labour leader retorted that there had been 'months of teases' about the
chancellor's proposals and urged them to accept 'in the name of
reasonability' that Labour should have another six days to produce its
alternative Budget.
He described the occupants of the Treasury bench as 'hollow men' who
preferred a 'bribery whimper' to a 'recovery bang'. He called on the
chancellor to explain why, if he believed that borrowing for tax cuts was an
effective means of remedying the recession, he had not followed that policy
last year.
The Labour leader contrasted the government reliants on a consumer-led
recovery with his party's policies designed to promote an investment-led
recovery. A Labour government would ensure Britain had a well trained work
force and a consistently sucessful and 'socially just' economy.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget: Investors shocked by PSBR forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS and City analysts were shocked by the government's forecast that
public borrowing in the next fiscal year would rise to Pounds 28bn.
Prices in the gilt-edged or government bond market fell sharply as investors
recognised that the government would have to sell an increased volume of
gilts to finance the borrowing requirement. Immediately after the
chancellor's speech, gilt prices fell by about 5/8 .
Sterling also lost the modest gains it made during the day, and analysts
said the chances of a cut in base rates were much reduced. The pound closed
in New York last night at DM2.8691, at the bottom end of its range within
the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Mr Nick Parsons, treasury adviser at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,
said: 'I don't see sterling going up very much in the short term.'
'The PSBR was right at the top end of City expectations,' said Mr Gerrard
Lyons, economist at Daichi Kangyo, the Japanese bank. He said the sharp rise
in PSBR showed the 'sheer scale of the recession', which has reduced
government revenues.
In the previous Budget the government forecast revenues of Pounds 240bn for
1992-93. However, the chancellor yesterday cut this forecast to Pounds
229.8bn. Mr Lyons said that the delay in economic recovery meant that
companies and individuals would earn less than expected and thus pay less in
taxes.
However, some investors and fund managers feared that the PSBR may turn out
to be even higher than the forecast: 'I am anxious that the PSBR is
understated by too rosy a forecast of economic growth by the end of this
year', said a manager in charge of one of the biggest UK investment funds.
Mr Brian Pearce, chief economist at the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, a
forecasting body which uses the Treasury's economic model, said the
government's borrowing predictions 'showed realism' about the poor outlook
for the next few months.
Mr Lyons warned that 'government expenditure may be out of control'. He said
that the government may have to pay more in benefits to the unemployed than
it currently expected.
There were mixed reactions from the chairmen of big City companies and from
fund managers. Sir John Cuckney, chairman of Royal Insurance, and of 3i, the
UK's biggest provider of long-term finance to small and medium-sized
companies, said: 'The economy is like a man who needs a stiff drink. The
Budget was a single, but I think it needed a double.'
Mr Roger Bartley, chief investment officer at County Natwest Investment
Management, said his one concern, a 'personal view', was whether the Budget
was over-cautious: 'The tax cut was of assistance to those (the low-paid)
who would not normally have voted Tory anyway. That might not have been the
best use of money to gain votes.'
Sir Nicholas Goodison, chairman of TSB Group and of the British Bankers
Association, praised the government for not cutting taxes further to buy
votes: 'I am glad they are taking a long-term view.'

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget: The Measures at a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
New lower tax band
The chancellor left the 25p basic tax rate unchanged but introduced a lower
rate of 20 pence in the pound for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income.
The change, which Mr Lamont said would benefit the low paid, will make most
taxpayers about Pounds 2.64 a week better off. The ceiling on mortgage tax
relief was left unchanged at Pounds 30,000, but will be applied at 25 per
cent throughout despite the new 20p rate.
Personal allowances: Income tax and age related allowances will rise in line
with inflation. The married couple's allowance will be frozen this year, but
husbands and wives will be allowed to transfer this allowance from the
husband to the wife or to share it equally from April 1993. The wife will be
allowed to claim half the allowance at her own request.
Pensions increase
Single pensioners on income support will get an extra Pounds 2 per week and
married couples an extra Pounds 3 a week from October.
Boost for car industry
The rate of car tax was halved from 10 per cent to 5 per cent at midnight
last night. The capital allowance limit on business cars will be raised from
Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 12,000 so that 80 per cent of business cars will be
treated like any other business asset. Taxis, car hire firms and driving
schools will be allowed to reclaim VAT when they buy cars.
A move to company car tax scales based solely on the price of the car rather
than the size of its engine is being considered. The VAT charge levied when
firms offer employees a choice between a car or extra salary will be
scrapped.
Excise duties raised
Excise duties on alcohol, diesel and unleaded petrol will rise in line with
inflation. The duty on leaded petrol will rise by 7.5 per cent, widening the
differential between taxes on leaded and unleaded petrol to 5p per litre.
Duty on cigarettes and other tobacco (including the chancellor's own
favourite - slim panatellas) will rise by about 10 per cent, raising the
price of a packet of 20 cigarettes by 13p. Pipe tobacco will rise in line
with inflation. One concession to smokers: the duty on matches and
mechanical lighters will be abolished. Vehicle excise duty on cars will be
increased by Pounds 10 to Pounds 110. Betting duty will be cut from 8 per
cent to 7 3/4 per cent.
Help for companies
No change in corporation tax rate or depreciation allowances.
No business will face an increase in the uniform business rate (UBR) higher
than the rate of inflation. This includes those properties protected by the
transitional arrangements set up to ease the switch from rates to the UBR in
1990. Occupiers of new premises, currently not eligible for transitional
relief, will inherit the transitional protection of the previous occupier.
Most business assets will now be exempt from inheritance tax so that family
businesses can be passed on without a tax charge.
The business expansion scheme will be scrapped from the end of 1993 but the
chancellor announced measures to make it easier to use the BES for mortgage
rescue schemes.
Small businesses
To improve the speed at which bills are paid, bigger companies will have to
state in their annual reports how quickly they pay bills. Government
contracts will include clauses requiring contractors to make prompt payment
to subcontractors. The limit for employers making quarterly rather than
monthly PAYE and NIC payments will be increased to Pounds 450.
Savings and inheritance
The annual limit on Personal Equity plans (Peps) will be raised from Pounds
3,000 to Pounds 6,000 for unit and investment trusts. The threshold for
inheritance tax will rise by more than inflation to Pounds 150,000. The
amount of capital gains exempt from tax will rise in line with inflation
from Pounds 5,500 to Pounds 5,800.
Value Added Tax
Penalties for mistakes on VAT returns will be reduced so that a penalty will
no longer be imposed for an error of less than Pounds 2,000. The system
under which small businesses with turnover under Pounds 300,000 can defer
VAT payments until bills owing to them are paid will be extended to those
owing Customs and Excise up to Pounds 5,000.
The film industry
Tax relief for pre-production costs will be available as it is incurred and
production expenditure will be written off at a flat rate of 33 per cent
once the film is finished.
PSBR doubles in 1992-93
Budget giveaways totalling Pounds 1.49bn were more modest than the City was
expecting. But moderate economic growth and depressed tax revenues mean that
the government is now forecasting a public sector borrowing requirement of
Pounds 28.1bn, higher than expected.
Between 1991-92 and 1992-93, total expenditure is expected to rise by Pounds
22bn while total revenue increases by just Pounds 7.7bn. A PSBR of Pounds
28.1bn, up from Pounds 13.8bn in this current fiscal year, is equivalent to
4 1/2 per cent of GDP. Excluding Pounds 8bn of privatisation receipts the
figure rises to 5 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1992-93.
A medium-term fiscal strategy:
According to the Red Book, the government's objective is to 'balance the
budget over the medium term while permitting the 'automatic stabilisers' to
operate . . . The budget will return towards balance as activity recovers.'
Fiscal imbalance:
General government expenditure is forecast to peak in 1993-94 at 42 1/4 per
cent of GDP, up from 40 1/2 per cent in the current fiscal year, before
falling again as annual GDP growth rises above 3 per cent. Tax revenues are
expected to fall by 1 percentage point to 37 per cent of GDP in 1992-93 and
then to rise in subsequent years. But the PSBR is still forecast to remain
in deficit at least until 1996-97, by which time it will have fallen back to
 3/4 per cent of GDP.
'A Budget for recovery'
Economic growth will resume this year, the chancellor said. The recovery
will 'start slowly but gather pace' encouraged by falling inflation at home,
and by rising confidence and falling interest rates in the US and Europe.
The chancellor blamed the 'unexpected weakness' of the US and world economy
for undermining the 'clear signs of renewed growth in the late summer and
early autumn of last year.' GDP fell by 2 1/2 per cent last year.
The defeat of inflation will bring 'enormous benefits to British businesses
and families', he said. But unemployment is expected to carry on rising 'for
some time', although at a slower rate.
He confirmed the government's commitment to membership of the European
exchange rate mechanism. Sterling will be moved to narrow bands within the
ERM at its current central rate of DM2.95 'in due course.'
The highlights of the economic forecast are:
Growth resumes: GDP grows by 1 per cent this year. This is slightly higher
than the consensus of City forecasters, but substantially lower than the 2
1/4 per cent growth the government forecast in its Autumn Statement. The
recovery is expected to gain momentum in the second half of the year. GDP
grows by 2 per cent higher in the second half of 1992 compared with the same
period a year ago, and 3 per cent in the first half of 1993.
Inflation falling: Retail price inflation falls to 3 3/4 per cent by the end
of 1992, and to 3 1/4 per cent by the middle of next year. Factory gate
price inflation falls further to 1 1/2 per cent by the middle of 1993.
Sluggish spending: Consumer spending grows by 1 per cent this year, but
picks up to 3 per cent in the first half of 1993. Fixed investment spending
falls by  1/2 per cent in 1992 but grows by 3 1/2 per cent in the first half
of 1993.
Trade deficit widens: The current account deficit rises to Pounds 6 1/2 bn
this year, and to Pounds 9bn, at an annual rate, in the first half of 1993.
Exports grow by 3 1/2 per cent in 1992, lower than the 6 per cent forecast
in the Autumn Statement, but imports grow by 4 per cent. By the first half
of 1993, exports growth rises to 6 1/2 per cent and import growth to 8 1/4
per cent as the world and UK recoveries gain momentum.
World recovery: There is a modest world economic recovery this year. The
total output of the seven largest industrialised countries grows by 1 1/2
per cent this year and by 2 3/4 per cent in the first half of 1993. World
trade ion manufactures grows by 4 per cent this year, and 6 1/4 per cent in
the first half of next year.
Spring Budget bites the dust
Whoever wins the election, yesterday's budget was one of the last as we know
it. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, began his speech with the announcement
that from December 1993, tax and expenditure decisions will be brought
together and announced in a December budget - an idea already touted by the
Labour Party. The new 'crystal clear' budget will show 'where the money is
coming from and where it is going to,' said Mr Lamont.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Allied merger plan referred to MMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPOSED Pounds 510m merger of the UK brewing operations of
Allied-Lyons, the drinks, food and retailing group, and Carlsberg, the
Danish brewer, was referred yesterday to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, said the planned joint
venture, Carlsberg-Tetley, raised questions of competition in the UK beer
market which deserved investigation. The MMC has been asked to report by
June 12.
The 50-50 joint venture, announced in October, would bring together Allied's
six breweries, which make brands such as Castlemaine lager and Britain's
best-selling ale, Tetley, and Carlsberg's modern brewery at Northampton.
The combined operation would command about 18 per cent of the UK beer
market, close to Bass, the leader, at 23 per cent.
Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of fair trading, is understood to have
advised Mr Lilley of his concern that this further consolidation would not
involve any weakening of the brewer's links with pub retailing.
Carlsberg-Tetley would supply Allied's tied estate of more than 4,000 pubs.
Mr Lilley gave a warning when he approved the pubs-for-breweries swap
between Grand Metropolitan and Courage less than 18 months ago that 'the
greater the degree of concentration in the industry, the more reluctant I
will be to allow further increases in market share by acquisition'.
He also said that any increases in concentration by mergers involving the
big brewers would be unwelcome unless they were counterbalanced by a
weakening of their links with pub retailing.
Allied, which considers the merger vital to its future competitive position,
said it was disappointed by the referral.
The company has run into difficulties with the OFT in its attempt to meet
government orders to free 2,800 pubs from tied beer supplies. It leased 734
pubs to Brent Walker last month in spite of an OFT warning that the pubs
would not count towards its disposal target.

FT  11 MAR 92 / British Gas agrees to cut market share in OFT deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS has agreed with the Office of Fair Trading to auction part of
its gas supply in order to halve its share of the industrial gas market in
the next three years. Based on last year's after-tax profits of Pounds
1.16bn, the move could cost British Gas between Pounds 140m and Pounds 150m
a year.
The company has also completed plans to put its pipeline and storage system
into a separate subsidiary as part of a package of undertakings which aims
to encourage competition in UK gas supply.
But the deal, which will be announced today, is viewed with scepticism by
Ofgas, the industry regulator. Sir James McKinnon, director-general of
Ofgas, is expected to distance himself from the final undertakings, though
he will want to maintain pressure on the OFT to ensure that British Gas does
not try to increase prices to compensate for lost business.
The agreement forces British Gas to cut its share of the industrial market
to 50 per cent or 3,000m therms, whichever is smaller, by 1994. The company
will be required to cut its market share a further 10 per cent in 1995.
The OFT is believed to be exerting behind-the-scenes pressure on British Gas
not to raise prices as it loses market share, but instead to turn away
customers for whom it has no gas.
This, however, brings it into conflict with Ofgas, which says British Gas
must meet any reasonable request for gas.
Today's deal was reached after the OFT threatened a month ago to refer
British Gas to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The agreement was
patched together after the intervention of Mr John Wakeham, energy
secretary, who was anxious to avoid a public row before the general
election.
Sir James is believed to have favoured a reference to the MMC as a way of
forcing the debate out into the open. But he has softened his initial
opposition to the deal and now believes it is the best that can be achieved
in such a short time.
The deal calls on British Gas to sell 500m therms of its gas to competitors
in October, for which the company will be able to charge an average
wholesale price as well as a handling fee.
Details of the auction will be available by the end of April.
After that, the OFT will monitor supply and demand in the market to
determine how much gas British Gas must auction each year to reduce its
market share.
As part of the agreement, the gas must go to competitors supplying the
general industrial market and not to the power generation sector where
demand is growing.
In addition, British Gas has agreed to begin operating its huge transmission
and storage division as a separate unit within the company from October.
The unit will begin publishing separate accounts for the subsidiary for
1993.
Ofgas will regulate the pipeline division under new legislation that will be
published as part of the Utilities Bill.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Glynwed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If it were needed, there was confirmation of the dire state of the economy
from the one large industrial company reporting yesterday. Recovery is
nowhere in the picture for Glynwed, but cannot come quickly enough. The 6
per cent rise in its shares was prompted by yet another maintained dividend
from an engineering company not earning enough to cover the payment. The
market chose to ignore the 64 per cent annual profits fall and the
pessimistic trading statement which accompanied the figures, focusing
instead on the positive impact expected this year from cost-cutting
measures. Given that the group was hit to the tune of Pounds 11m by problems
in its copper tubing division, the underlying trading position was perhaps
more resilient than expected.
One question is whether Glynwed is vulnerable to a predator. The balance
sheet is healthy enough, although stated gearing of 40 per cent is more like
50 per cent when finance leases are included. An aggressive conglomerate
might be interested in some of the businesses, particularly those like Aga
which have strong market niches. The problem is that the shares look
expensive on a prospective multiple of 15, assuming nearly doubled earnings
this year.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: BES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The abolition of the Business Expansion Scheme is one of the Budget's more
welcome features, and should help stimulate the debate over how small
companies are best financed. BES investors have enjoyed an excessive tax
break long after the scheme was largely diverted from its original purpose
of raising venture capital for small businesses. Intermediaries will
doubtless make full use of their two opportunities to stampede investors
into new schemes before the system's demise at the end of next year,
although it is hard to see that adding much economic stimulus. There must
also be doubts over how far the housing market will be helped by the easing
of rules on assured tenancy schemes for owner-occupiers in danger of
repossession.
As for the government's position that the UK venture capital industry is now
sufficiently mature to fill the gap left by BES, that looks a little
complacent. While BES has passed its sell-by date, there might still be a
need for incentives in future. Unless, that is, the City plans to become
much more friendly to such high-risk investments.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors will be hard pressed to draw up a long or convincing list of stock
market winners. The lack of any change in the capital allowances regime
disappointed some expectations, while apparently generous reductions in the
uniform business rate and concessions to the motor industry are likely to
have only a marginal effect.
The UBR, for instance, raises Pounds 14bn-Pounds 15bn a year for local
authorities, which puts Mr Lamont's Pounds 480m giveaway for 1992-93 into
context. Brewers and distillers, hotels, and retailers - whose assets are
predominantly land and buildings - will be obvious beneficiaries. But the
chancellor's hope that the property market can be unlocked with the help of
transitional relief for new occupiers looks wishful thinking. Smaller,
nursery style, units may well receive a boost but the main problem for the
property sector remains one of chronic oversupply. Property shares have been
ravaged in the last year, but they still look vulnerable if bad poll news
were badly to unsettle the gilts market. The stimulus to the motor trade,
meanwhile, was largely as predicted, though Lucas followers should be
pleased by the surprise decision to calculate car scale charges by reference
to the value of the vehicle rather than its engine size. The car tax
reduction should at least tempt consumers who have deferred purchases,
though much will depend on how far it is passed on.
Elsewhere, there is some comfort to be drawn from the long-term commitment
to address the problem of advance corporation tax, to fight the good fight
for Scotch whisky and cider makers in Brussels, and to improve payment terms
for sub-contractors. The imaginative requirement that companies publish how
quickly they pay their bills in annual reports, indeed, may be one of this
Budget's more enduring legacies for the City. Smug boasts about 30 days
sounds like the signal for a stockbroker's Sell.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Lamont's lament for gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,574.8 (+24.1)
The City may have been hoping for some nice surprises from Mr Lamont
yesterday. In the event, it received one nasty one. Next year's PSBR will be
some Pounds 4bn higher than most forecasters expected, even after the most
niggardly of tax cuts. The only consolation for those who have been
discounting a Tory victory was that the Budget takes some wind out of
Labour's sails. Labour would find it awkward to unwind yesterday's tax cuts.
Whoever wins the election will be saddled with a PSBR of 4.5 per cent of
GDP. Labour could scarcely finance an ambitious programme without steep tax
increases.
That, however, is a mere theoretical advantage. It is a long way from the
budget guaranteed to win electoral support for which the City had hoped. The
prospective Pounds 28bn PSBR was already weighing on both sterling and the
gilts market last night. Interest cuts look more remote than ever. There was
a disappointing limpness in the chancellor's reiteration of the commitment
to put sterling into narrow bands. The danger of the vicious circle still
lurks in which currency weakness and the government's dwindling standing in
the polls feed on each other.
Against this background, it is difficult to see why the FT-SE should hold on
to yesterday's 1 per cent gain. The market may have expected the chancellor
to trim his 1992 growth forecast; it had scarcely an inkling of the extent
to which revenue erosion has caused the PSBR to balloon. The Bank of England
has virtually satisfied its funding needs for this year, but was quick to
announce an increase in the size of its regular auctions. Equities will thus
face extra competition for investors' money. Even the market's modest
recovery hopes may be dented by the daunting scale of the effort that will
eventually be needed to put the government's finances back on an orderly
footing.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Clinton victory in key state polls: Arkansas governor
strengthens bid as Democratic candidate for presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas took a giant stride yesterday towards
becoming the Democratic party's nominee for the US presidential election in
November.
He convincingly beat his main challenger, Mr Paul Tsongas, in the critical
primary election in Florida and immediately capped that with a clean sweep
of six other southern states.
Mr Tsongas won his home state of Massachusetts and neighbouring Rhode
Island, and was narrowly ahead in the caucuses of party voters in Delaware.
But Mr Clinton's march through Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma,
Missouri and Tennessee, as well as Florida, has given him great momentum for
the important northern primaries in Illinois and Michigan next week.
On the Republican side, the story of the string of 'Super Tuesday' elections
was much as it has been all year. President George Bush swept all eight
states where Republicans voted, some by very wide margins, but he could not
completely shake off Mr Pat Buchanan, his rightwing opponent.
In Florida, Mr Buchanan was pulling a third of the vote and even in the
president's home state of Texas, as well as in Tennessee and Oklahoma - in
all of which Mr Buchanan had barely campaigned - the anti-Bush vote, mostly
for Mr Buchanan, was running at over a quarter.
For the Democrats, Florida was always the litmus test and Mr Tsongas's best,
perhaps only, chance of an upset, since the other six southern states voting
yesterday actually have borders with Mr Clinton's Arkansas.
But, with a third of the Florida vote counted, Mr Clinton was winning nearly
51 per cent, against 32 per cent for Mr Tsongas and 15 per cent for Jerry
Brown, the former governor of California.
The Clinton strategy had always been based on a strong 'Super Tuesday'
showing. But, pressed by Mr Tsongas, he had recourse for the first time to
some negative advertising in Florida. Exit polls showed that two were
particularly effective - the charges that his opponent would raise petrol
taxes and possibly cut social security benefits.
Mr Tsongas, who responded in kind, confessed last night he had been 'knocked
off stride' by the Clinton onslaught.
But polling also showed that Mr Clinton's support was deep and wide. In
Florida and other southern states, he was easily the most popular among all
ethnic, age and demographic groups. His share of the black vote even
rivalled that achieved by the Rev Jesse Jackson four years ago, though many
fewer blacks voted this time.
Nevertheless Mr Tsongas was bloody but unbowed last night, promising a crowd
of supporters in Massachusetts: 'I will be the Democratic president.'
He and Mr Brown can continue fighting for some time since Mr Clinton is
still a long way short of the 2,145 convention delegates he needs for the
Democratic nomination.
Democratic party rules apportion delegates according to complex formulae
based in part on shares of the popular vote, plus an allotment given to
state party leaders. It is possible Mr Clinton will not wrap up the
nomination until the June, which gives his opponents hope, as long as they
can still afford to fight against him.
The Republicans generally award delegates on a state winner-take-all basis,
meaning Mr Bush should be home and dry long before then. The White House
claimed last night that 'for all practical purposes, he has won the
nomination'. But there is no sign of a Buchanan withdrawal, in spite of
calls yesterday by a cabal of Republican congressmen in the White House that
he do so.

<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Jack's article on the effect on share prices produced by
circulars commenting merely on the rearrangement of accounting information
could have carried the argument further. Mr Jack says, the effects in
question were dissipated fairly shortly, so there would only be an
inefficiency in the market if it were possible to make money by buying or
selling after ascertaining that each circular contained no new information
(or judgment about the company in question). If money cannot be made (over a
reasonable number of cases), or if the return does not compensate for the
risks run (essentially betting against the market makers), then there is no
inefficiency.
But if there is an inefficiency (that is, money can be made at acceptable
risk) it does not mean that the efficient market theory is wrong, only that
markets are not 100 per cent efficient: the approach of Modern Portfolio
Theory is now concentrating largely on the fact that there are
inefficiencies to be exploited. Overall, however, the evidence is that
markets (at least in larger shares) are highly efficient at allocating
capital and that mis-pricing is relatively small.
Since the efficient market theory is not intuitive and not accepted in some
important places, it is essential to emphasise that this (possible)
inefficiency does not upset the present state of this theory. Also if there
is this particular inefficiency and it persists, then arbitrageurs will come
in and eliminate it, and fairly soon. Anyway, Mr Jack's article has drawn it
to their attention.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GARETH SMYTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A small clarification to Joe Rogaly's very perceptive piece on the LSE
symposium on hung parliaments ('King Kong antics', March 6).
The joint organisers of the event, Common Voice, advocate informed voting in
the sense that voters are surely entitled to information on the parties'
standings in their constituency.
Whether voters choose to vote tactically is between them and the ballot box,
and not something on which Common Voice gives advice.
There is an interesting problem for any informed voter warming to Mr
Rogaly's suggestion that a hung parliament could produce the conditions for
the ending of single-party government: how to vote for a hung parliament.

<TEXT>
Sir, It is always a pity to spoil a good story. However, your article on
SIB's proposals for disclosing life assurance companies' expenses, ('SIB
bows to life companies' lobbying', March 5) is well wide of the mark.
Expense figures which enable customers and commentators to make effective
comparisons between products and between companies have been available for
some time. SIB's proposals involve making these more easily understood and
more readily available, and we support these moves.
Indeed, we would be delighted if these proposals were also to be applied to
the products offered by banks and building societies, so that consumers
could make better-informed comparisons across the whole range of products on
offer.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Arts: Goin' Local/The Foursome - Theatre Royal, Stratford
East/Barons Court Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two plays at opposite ends of London suggest, when compared, that English
self-confidence is continuing to decline. Both have strongly regional
backgrounds, but neither is entirely cut off from the national scene.
The Foursome by Ted Whitehead was first performed at the Royal Court
Upstairs in 1971. It was described at the time as 'dirty', a word that now
sounds curiously archaic. Certainly it contains some overt-ish sex,
including a male strip before such acts became a minor cult. For the rest,
it is a sharply written tale of two boys picking up two girls and spending
the Sunday with them on a Merseyside beach. That was when the Beatles were
still going strong and there seemed scarcely a cloud on the horizon. No-one
is out of a job, even if the work force is not highly motivated.
At the end, the boys dump the girls to make their own way back to Liverpool.
But there is no reason to think that the girls will be particularly
aggrieved: they have given as good as they got, and it's on to the next
weekend. Recognition of Merseyside's problems came later.
Revived at the Barons Court Theatre in west London, with some of the old
1960s songs thrown in, the play now looks like a piece of nostalgia, though
it was notable that a predominantly young audience took to it warmly,
perhaps believing that nothing has changed.
There is no such optimism in Tunde Ikoli's Goin' Local, which had its
premiere at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East on Monday. Here is the home of
the old, proud Cockney London that defied the blitz. It appears to have lost
its spirit and to be succumbing to Docklands almost without a fight.
The setting of Ikoli's play is a very good one: and old cab company running
derelict cars with derelict drivers in a derelict area. The cabbies try
their hardest to avoid inspection by social security, whose benefits they
draw without declaring their earnings. Can such security last?
The answer depends on whether there is such a species as Cockney yuppies.
One would have thought that there always was: before the term 'yuppy' was
invented, they were called spivs. In the Docklands era, however, they come
sprouting modern business language, looking for the PBO (perfect business
opportunity) and aware that in the late 1980s it was much easier to borrow
from banks than rob them.
The yuppies take over and introduce 'passenger-friendly' cars (ie Mercedes),
although in the end they, too, might get their come-uppance for continuing
to defraud social security, just like the simpler, nicer, older Cockneys
before them.
Not a bad plot: the weakness lies in the play's funereal slowness. These
Cockneys don't make many jokes any more: they don't fight; they whinge. It
is as if they know they are beaten and no longer bother to protest. One of
their complaints is against the men who come down from the north, sleep in
the open 'without overheads' and can afford to accept low wages.
The production, directed by Philip Hedley, could improve considerably if it
were speeded up. But Hedley is an experienced producer, so one can only
assume that the slowness is deliberate.
The Foursome at Barons Court is not like that at all. The direction by
Maximillian Jacobson-Gonzales is as electrifying as some of the best of the
Beatles' songs. So is the playing.
It is a shining example of how to use the small space of a pub theatre:
exploit every square inch you can. Goin' Local looks more like an exercise
in how to fill up a stage while keeping the actors static. Nevertheless,
both pieces tell you something about contemporary England.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Arts: The Crackwalker - Gate, Notting Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Theresa is fat, phlegmatic and plainly retarded. Not being retarded is
Alan's sole asset; he shows meagre signs of growing up, has no skills, is
prone to reliving his childhood nightmares and submerging them in drink. He
worships Joe, a blustering lout who likes to beat up on his woman Sandy,
especially when he's drunk, and that seems to turn her on more than anything
else. Sandy is still just about pretty, but soured beyond hope. They all
live in Kingston, Ontario.
The Junior Chamber of Commerce there must have been dismayed by Judith
Thompson's first play, a dozen years ago. Since then she has won national
awards for other pieces, and the strengths of The Crackwalker whet one's
appetite to see them. The language here is faithfully, repetitiously foul,
without any of the low-life 'poetic' flights one feared. Yet these
miserable, marginal characters reveal themselves in extra-lucid detail.
When Joe pulls up stakes to go West, Al sets up house with poor 'Treeze'
because she reminds him of the Madonna in school pictures. Treeze is happy
to have her own Bay-bee Jesus, and her anxious social workers tell Al that
he is a great father; but he declines into alcoholic paranoia, the baby
proves sad and dim, and soon it meets a predictably horrid end. Sandy
decamps to Calgary to continue her violent relations with Joe on a higher
economic plane; she hopes Treeze will visit, one of these days.
For respectable Canadian audiences, The Crackwalker must have offered
something like the nasty revelations of Tobacco Road 50 years ago in the US.
Thompson's people have no history, and are neither rebellious nor
disappointed - merely baffled losers in a market-place where most people are
managing much better. Each of them gets a direct-to-audience address,
without milking for pathos, though Al's private horrors wrench the guts.
Robert Bowman plays him with defenceless honesty, from abject Joe-worship
through proud, nervous fatherhood to disintegration, and he captures
perfectly the plaintive rising inflections of small-city Canadian. Kathy
Burke's Treeze is a serene, clinically exact study, touching and appalling
as she totes her dead baby 'to the graveyard' in a plastic toy-bag, placidly
accepting the loss of a doll while looking around for a nice new boy-friend.
Neil Dudgeon exposes vulnerable points in Joe's macho violence.
Their accents come near enough, which matters in this starkly demotic stuff.
For Sandy, Kathryn Pogson's comes from nowhere and her style of twitchy,
would-be-metropolitan poise comes from the wrong side of the Atlantic. There
is a fifth character, a wrecked Canadian Indian even more marginalised than
the others, whom Kennetch Charlette (a real-life Cree) represents as weirdly
detached, benign and desperate.
The director James Macdonald keeps the action swift, unfussy and perfectly
focused. Though the Gate's minuscule playing-area leaves a designer scant
room to be clever, Ian MacNeil has contrived one flash of trompe-l'oeil.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Solicitor to head Serious Fraud Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GEORGE STAPLE is to succeed Mrs Barbara Mills QC as director of the
Serious Fraud Office. Mrs Mills has been appointed director of public
prosecutions after only 16 months at the head of the SFO.
Mr Staple, a partner in Clifford Chance, the UK's largest law firm, is
largely unknown outside City legal circles and was a surprise choice to
spearhead the fight against fraud and white-collar crime. But those who know
him well say he has just the right mix of practical, City and managerial
experience for the job.
Mr William Park, a senior partner at law firm Linklaters &amp; Paines, said Mr
Staple had long experience of company and commercial practice, including
civil fraud litigation. Mr Staple worked as a Department of Trade and
Industry inspector in the Consolidated Gold Fields inquiry in 1986 and the
1988 inquiry into Aldermanbury Trust.
Mr Park said Mr Staple's City perspective was probably better than that of
his two predecessors at the SFO. Coming from a different culture, he might
well have a greater awareness of the real evils in City fraud and its
effects on the public.
Mr John Clitheroe of Kingsley Napley, a leading defence solicitor, said it
was a very imaginative appointment. He hoped Mr Staple could 'work towards
an assimilation of the DTI and SFO investigations'.
Although Mr Staple has spent most of his time at Clifford Chance doing
commercial litigation since he qualified as a solicitor in 1964, Mr Nigel
Fox Bassett, the firm's senior partner, said he had considerable experience
of fraud and white-collar crime in the UK and abroad during a period in the
firm's Hong Kong office. Mr Staple is chairman of the authorisation and
disciplinary appeal tribunal of the Securities and Futures Association and
acts as a legal assessor on the disciplinary committee of the Stock
Exchange.
Mr Gareth Williams QC, chairman of the Bar, welcomed his appointment and
said the Bar was not disappointed that a solicitor rather than a barrister
had been selected.
Mr Rodger Pannone, whose firm defended Mr Ernest Saunders, the former
Guinness chairman, and will be acting for Mr Asil Nadir, former chairman of
Polly Peck International who faces criminal charges, described the choice of
Mr Staple, a colleague on the Law Society council, as 'inspired'. Mr Pannone
described him as 'a man of great ability, fiscal knowledge and breadth of
vision, with tremendous experience of commercial litigation at the highest
level.' He added: 'He's also an extremely likeable individual.'
Mr Staple has been on the society's governing council since 1986.

FT  11 MAR 92 / MPs may rebuke Maxwells
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMMITTEE of MPs may decide today to rebuke Mr Ian Maxwell and his brother
Kevin for impeding a Commons inquiry into the Maxwell pensions scandal - but
any action is expected to be postponed until after the general election.
The cross-party social security committee will meet to agree its reaction to
the brothers' refusal to answer even a written questionnaire on the affair.
One other trustee of a Maxwell company pension fund is also believed to have
refused to answer the questionnaire.
Many MPs on the committee have been angered by the Maxwells' refusal, saying
it has prevented a complete investigation of how the brothers' father, the
late Robert Maxwell, was able to take more than Pounds 400m from the pension
funds of companies he controlled. However, other MPs on the committee may
try to dilute the report.
Lawyers acting for the brothers have said they have 'a precious
constitutional right and a historic one' to remain silent.
The closeness of the general election is understood to have persuaded MPs on
the committee there is no hope of the affair being debated by the whole of
the Commons until the next parliament. The committee could, however, make
suggestions for a successor committee to pursue.
On Monday, in response to the Maxwell affair, the committee recommended
sweeping reform of the UK pensions industry, including a new pensions act.
Its report said the financial institutions which bankrolled Robert Maxwell
had a moral obligation to help pensioners defrauded in the affair.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said yesterday that the government would
need 'some time' to consider the report before responding. He told the
Commons at question time that it raised a number of 'very complex and
inter-related matters' for the pensions industry, banks, actuaries, auditors
and regulators as well as the government.
He said the cause of Maxwell Group pensioners' problems was 'all too clear'.
He added: 'There appears to have been a massive fraud perpetrated under the
very eyes of the trustees.'

FT  11 MAR 92 / London rail bomb blast causes chaos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BOMB exploded early yesterday near Wandsworth Common railway station in
south-west London, disrupting train services in the capital but causing no
injuries.
The bomb exploded in a junction box alongside the track about 30 minutes
after the police received a telephone warning. The area had been evacuated
by the time the bomb went off.
Shortly after the blast another security alert caused Liverpool Street main
line station to be closed and Underground services from there were
suspended.
The police said telephoned warnings using code words had been given in each
incident. Nobody has claimed responsibility for the incidents, but they are
in line with the current IRA campaign of disrupting train services. Last
month an IRA bomb at London Bridge station injured 28 people.
The IRA has warned that it will continue its campaign on the mainland in an
attempt to force Northern Ireland politics on to the general election
agenda.
British Rail said services to and from Victoria would be delayed and reduced
in the next few days and emergency timetables would be used.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Prices at factory gates up by 0.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CORE rate of inflation remained 4.4 per cent in February even though the
rate rose by a higher-than-expected 0.4 per cent during the month. The core
rate is a measure of the year-on-year rise in prices at factory gates.
The year-on-year rate of 4.4 per cent was the lowest since mid 1988. The
City had expected a rise of only 0.3 per cent for the month, but economists
said underlying inflation was still on a declining trend.
The latest figures suggest that many manufacturers are avoiding price
increases in an attempt to maintain sales in a climate of fragile demand.
Excluding volatile items such as food, drink and tobacco, the index rose by
only 2.8 per cent in the 12 months to February compared with a 3.1 per cent
rise in the year to January. The CSO said the February figure was the lowest
since June 1969 when it was 2.7 per cent. It compares with a high of 6.4 per
cent in February last year.
The cost of raw materials and fuel used by manufacturing industry jumped by
1.6 per cent between January and February, bringing the annual rate of
increase to 0.5 per cent after a fall of 1.1 per cent in the 12 months to
January.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Managers to take BT to tribunal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of BT managers who claim they have been threatened with a pay freeze
unless they sign personal contracts are to take their case to an industrial
tribunal.
The 49 managers, members of the STE telecommunications managers' union, say
they are among 170 staff who were told they would not receive a pay rise if
they retained terms and conditions negotiated by the STE.
The union argues that BT's action is, under the terms of the 1978 Employment
Protection Act, designed to prevent or deter membership of an independent
trade union.
BT first offered personal contracts to 4,000 middle managers in 1989 and
fewer than 200 now remain on terms and conditions negotiated by the STE. The
union claims many signed 'following pressure and threats that their careers
would suffer'.
BT said yesterday that the tribunal applications were misguided and that it
had never been 'the company's purpose to deter or penalise people for being
trade union members'.

   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry in Scotland, which last month said it
wanted improvements in the way in which Scotland is governed, has decided it
likes none of the proposals from political parties for constitutional change
north of the border.
Mr Alasdair MacCallum, chairman of the CBI in Scotland, said there was 'no
evidence to suggest that the proposed alternatives for governing Scotland
offer any improvement in the stability and confidence which are necessary to
improve the indigenous industrial base'.
Neither independence nor devolution would 'stimulate Scottish companies to
compete on price and quality in international markets or to secure higher
levels of inward investment', Mr MacCallum added. The aims of Scottish
business were likely to be best achieved by 'an improvement in the current
administrative arrangements within the UK'.
Mr McCallum said after a meeting of the council of the CBI in Scotland last
month that constitutional change was inevitable.
Last night Mr David MacLehose, the CBI's Scottish director, said
administrative improvements favoured by the the CBI included a single tier
of local government.

</HEADLINE>

   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has postponed plans to compel local authorities to introduce
registers of contaminated land by April 1 after complaints by developers and
landowners that such registers could blight their property.
It is estimated that 100,000 sites in the UK are contaminated by pollution
and that the total cost of reclamation would be between Pounds 10bn and
Pounds 30bn.
The postponement angered environmentalists. Mr Sean Humber, of Friends of
the Earth, said: 'The government's backtracking will leave the public
unaware of the risks posed by many sites.'
Mr David Trippier, environment minister, said the government was concerned
that land values would be unfairly blighted because of the registers. He
said that further consultations would take place but gave no target date for
eventual introduction of the register.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Citicorp settles in case on swaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOURTH of six lead cases in the long-running litigation between banks
and local authorities arising out of complex interest-rate swap agreements
was settled out of court yesterday by Citicorp Investment Bank.
The action by Citicorp Investment Bank, the UK arm of the US bank, against
Sandwell Borough Council in West Midlands had been due to come to court on
Monday.
About 80 banks face losses of up to Pounds 600m following a House of Lords
ruling last year that authorities were acting outside their powers in
entering swap agreements, in which fixed interest-rate payments are
exchanged for floating rate payments.
The banks are trying to recover about a quarter of their losses by suing for
restitution of funds paid to local authorities. With four of the six lead
cases settled out of court, however, it may be necessary to name fresh lead
cases.
Banks could prove reluctant to be involved in fresh lead cases, as the
process has proved expensive and time-consuming. One lawyer warned: 'It is
quite possible that the process will reach stalemate.'
Citicorp had claimed Pounds 521,323 against Sandwell which, in turn, was
claiming Pounds 269,246 from the London Borough of Hackney. Hackney had a
claim for interest against the London Borough of Brent. The terms of the
settlement are confidential.
The remaining lead cases - Chemical Bank and National Bank of North Carolina
against Hammersmith and Fulham - are scheduled to be heard after Easter, but
discussions about a settlement are believed to have begun.
It is estimated that, of the 200 writs against local authorities (stayed
when the lead cases were selected), about 50 cases have been settled
privately.
Others have been settled privately without writs being issued, and it is
unclear how many fresh writs may have been issued by banks.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Government confirms cuts by employers in training budgets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH employers began to cut training as early as last spring, according
to Department of Employment figures published yesterday, Michael Smith
writes.
The department's annual labour force survey is the first official
confirmation that training budgets have been cut during the recession.
The survey's findings are likely to embarrass the government in the run-up
to the election. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, accused the
government of publishing the figures on Budget day to reduce their impact.
The survey figures come when the number of employment and training
programmes run by the government has been declining. They will heighten
fears that employers may face problems in plugging skills gaps when the
recession ends.
The government has previously maintained that employers have heeded its
exhortations to maintain training budgets. Most independent surveys have
supported this assertion, and the Confederation of British Industry has
suggested that employers' commitment to training has increased.
The survey also charts a 4 per cent decline in the numbers of self-employed
in the year to last spring. It also estimates unemployment at 2.3m in the
spring last year.
The survey estimate for unemployment is based on a definition by the
International Labour Organisation. It includes people looking for work as
well as those receiving unemployment benefit.
The 2.3m jobless total compares with 2.1m registered unemployed at the time
 -the government's monthly unemployment figures include only those claiming
benefit.
The survey shows that the number of employees receiving job-related training
in the four weeks prior to the survey was 3.2m in spring 1991, against 3.3m
a year earlier - the first decline since 1984.
Employers agree that cuts in company training budgets during the previous
recession were a significant factor behind the skills shortages of the late
1980s.
The survey also shows that the number of people on government employment and
training schemes declined by 41,000 to 408,000 in the year to last spring.
The decline since 1988 is 112,000.
Other findings include:
Some 27.9m people were economically active last spring, a fall of 100,000 on
the previous year. Of those, 25.6m were in employment, a fall of 600,000 or
2 per cent on the previous year, but a rise of 2.2m since spring 1984.
People on government employment and training schemes accounted for 2 per
cent of all those in employment.
Last spring there were 400,000, or 2 per cent, fewer employees, and 200,000
fewer self-employed, down 4 per cent. However, the number of employees and
self-employed increased by 7 per cent and 27 per cent respectively between
1984 and last year. The number of people in non-manual occupations fell by 1
per cent against a 3 per cent decrease in manual occupations.
The number of people in trades unions or staff associations fell from 8.79m
to 8.54m.
The survey is based on interviews with members of about 60,000 private
households, conducted between March and May last year.

MR Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, has ordered the refuse
collection service run by Labour-led Haringey council in London to be closed
next year.
The move follows allegations of anti-competitive behaviour by the council in
awarding itself a contract for refuse collection and street cleaning.
The environment department said the council accepted the bid from its own
direct service organisation in spite of lower bids from Onyx and BFI
Wastecare.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Number of share owners falls 1.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of personal shareholders in the UK has fallen by 1.2m in the past
year, Richard Waters writes.
This is the first decline since the boom in share ownership created by the
privatisations of the 1980s. About 9.8m people now own shares, compared with
11m a year ago, according to the Treasury's annual survey of share ownership
conducted with ProShare, the wider share-ownership group.
The number has fallen in spite of the privatisations in the past 12 months
of the electricity generating companies and Scottish electricity companies,
and the sale of a substantial stake in BT. It means the proportion of adults
in the UK owning shares has fallen from 25 per cent last year to 22 per cent
this year.
According to the survey, conducted by NOP, 14 per cent of adults in Britain
own privatisation shares, the same proportion as last year. The proportion
of adults owning shares in the companies for which they work has remained
stable at 4 per cent.

FT  11 MAR 92 / FT European Water Conference: Ofwat seeks more power for
consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUCH greater involvement of customers in the setting of charges and levels
of service by water companies is to become a top priority, Mr Ian Byatt,
director-general of Ofwat, the industry's economic regulator, said
yesterday.
Mr Byatt warned at a Financial Times conference in London on the European
water industry that without much greater consumer participation the
regulatory regime of the privatised industry might be in jeopardy.
'This will not be an easy task, but I believe it is essential to try,' he
said. 'I would go so far as to say that, without acceptance by customers
that they are getting value for money, the whole regime could be at risk.'
Mr Byatt's views are significant because he will be responsible for drawing
up new charging limits in 1994 before they are implemented for five years
from April 1995. It will be the first big change in pricing levels since the
industry was privatised in 1989. After substantial price rises to pay for
the early stages of the Pounds 28bn capital spending programme, there will
be pressure for customers to be protected as much as possible.
Mr Byatt said he would concentrate on three strategic objectives in the
review. They were greater involvement of customers; more stable investment
and pricing over the next five years; and greater emphasis on service and
value for money.
He said investment in the industry during the past 20 years had been
erratic, and prices had tended to follow in quite steep steps. Investment
rose by 40 per cent last year and was due for a further 25 per cent increase
this year.
He explained that by 1995 much plant and equipment would be renewed, and it
should then be possible to improve assets at a steadier rate.
Mr Byatt urged the government to ensure that costs of new environmental
obligations were established before decisions were taken. Ministers should
consider the scale of benefits likely to be gained from new obligations and
the willingness - and sometimes the ability - of consumers to pay increased
bills.
Mr David Trippier, environment minister responsible for the water industry,
said there were three areas of European Community environment law which the
government would like improved: the machinery for enforcement, drafting of
laws, and the analysis which must precede and support drafting of
legislation.
He said there was little point in EC law on water unless it applied in a
comparable way across the community. At present there was no certainty of
this, and member states had very different ways of enforcing standards.

FT  11 MAR 92 / MoD secures cost cuts in multinational arms project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN has negotiated changes in a joint project with France and Germany
for a new anti-tank weapon fired by helicopters after objecting to the cost
of UK participation.
The decision to remain in the long-range Trigat project was announced by Mr
Kenneth Carlisle, junior defence minister, and greeted with relief by
British Aerospace, the main UK partner. It came a week after the company's
Dynamics guided-weapons division secured a crucial Pounds 570m order to
supply a new air-combat missile for the RAF.
Mr David Laybourn, the division's managing director, said Trigat promised to
provide 'major production opportunities' in the mid 1990s.
The Ministry of Defence said details of the agreement were confidential, but
savings had been achieved by cutting test firings by using more simulation.
Almost two thirds of the estimated Pounds 750m development cost has been
committed. The new plan is expected to reduce the cost to the UK of carrying
out the remaining development work by about half to Pounds 45m over the next
five years.
The decision maintains intact a three-nation programme agreed in 1988
covering both this long-range weapon and a medium-range weapon carried
either by troops or on vehicles. Each partner undertook a third of the work.
It is the only collaborative weapon development programme involving the UK
with both the French and Germans.
UK withdrawal from the longer-range weapon was mooted a year ago by Sir
Peter Levene, then chief of defence procurement. He also proposed that the
UK and France should pursue the medium-range weapon on their own, but this
was flatly rejected by Paris and Bonn. An option is being retained to mount
the longer-range weapon on special vehicles with folding masts, but priority
is being given to the helicopter role.
France and Germany intend to use the Trigat weapon on their new Tiger attack
helicopter. This craft may interest the British Army, but it will have to
compete against the US Apache helicopter proposed by the pairing of
McDonnell Douglas of the US and Westland of the UK.
BAe has reached preliminary agreement to act as prime contractor for the
Tiger bid.

FT  11 MAR 92 / North Sea oil industry adapts to shifting tides: David
Lascelles on how low prices and the Piper Alpha disaster have led companies
to change strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE handsome granite homes of Aberdeen with their well-tended gardens
suggest that Europe's oil capital remains prosperous. Yet there are signs of
anxiety in the large industrial estates which house the UK's offshore oil
industry.
The combination of a weak oil price and plenty of spare capacity in drilling
and contracting has led to belt-tightening and close questioning of the
industry's prospects. In addition, changes recommended in the Cullen Report
on North Sea safety, following the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster in which 167
workers died, will add substantially to the industry's costs.
Mr Norman Chambers, chief executive of Rockwater, one of the leading
underwater engineering contractors, predicts that demand in his sector of
the North Sea services industry will begin to tail off next year, the exact
rate depending on the oil price.
'The whole contracting and fabricating industry must downsize,' he warns.
'We're bullish for our own company, but we've got to be realistic about it.'
His views are echoed by Mr Gavin Strachan, marketing and contracts manager
of Atlantic Drilling, an independent drilling contractor. He points out that
at present rigs are used to 78 per cent capacity, compared with more than 90
per cent needed to sustain a healthy market. This has caused daily charge
rates to drop by half to about Pounds 12,000.
'Last year, for the first time, there were more rigs available in the North
Sea than in the Gulf of Mexico,' he says.
Operators blame the softening of the market - at the moment it is nothing
more dramatic than that - on two things: the low oil price which is blunting
incentive to explore, and the widespread feeling that all the big North Sea
finds have been made.
The fact that most current developments are much smaller than in the glory
days of the 1970s and early 1980s also makes them much easier for operators
to stop and start, adding uncertainty to the market.
The industry had made improvements ahead of the Cullen recommendations, but
the new rules, to be phased in from the end of this year, will add a further
burden. The safety modifications might cost an average of Pounds 1m a rig,
says Mr John Archibald, Atlantic's deputy general manager.
The outlook is not totally gloomy, however. A fresh round of exploration
licences has been announced, including 'frontier regions' - areas of the
North Sea and its western approaches that have not yet been explored.
The softening of the market has also encouraged the offshore contracting
industry to think afresh about its long-term future.
The oil and gas group of Scottish Enterprise, the state-funded development
body, has decided that the time has come for 'a long-term reorientation of
the industry from the diminishing home market to international markets'.
Last month Mr Crawford Beveridge, SE's chief executive, announced plans for
an export drive aimed at doubling overseas sales by 1996, equivalent to
growth of about Pounds 100m in 1990 money. 'Expansion of our indigenous oil
and gas companies will only ultimately be generated via
internationalisation,' he says.
One element of this drive will be the establishment of a sales office in
Moscow, where SE sees opportunities for Scottish industry to help develop
the oil and gas industry in the former Soviet republics. About Pounds 25m
has been earmarked for the office, spread over several years.
Aberdeen is also the home of a new International Drilling and Downhole
Technology Centre where oil companies can test offshore equipment on a
real-life rig, but in the safer and cheaper surroundings of dry land. Dr
David Curry, managing director, says: 'We shall be developing technology
which can be exported when the oil runs down.'
However, individual companies will have to adjust to tougher conditions in
the meantime.
Mr Chambers of Rockwater predicts that contracting companies will have to
share more of the risk with the oil companies in order to win business. In
certain cases the company is prepared to forego the traditional client
relationship in favour of forming partnerships with oil exploration
companies. Rockwater will do contracting work at cost, and take its profit
in the form of a share of the royalties.
Last week two Glasgow companies, Kvaerner H&amp;G and UIE, entered into similar
arrangements with British Petroleum to develop the Hyde gas field. BP said
partnerships 'are certainly something we are looking at'.
For companies like Atlantic, hope in the future is grounded partly in
controlling costs and partly in the belief that oil companies will be forced
to step up their search for oil.
'Why do we remain in the drilling business?', asks Mr Strachan. The answer
lies in figures which show that available oil reserves are being run down,
but that the exploration potential is still huge. 'The long-term strength of
the business is that we're going to have to find lots more oil,' he says.

FORMER Panamanian leader General Manuel Antonio Noriega said yesterday he

He said he had made the decision because 'my presentation would have to be
limited not to include political matters, issues of war, and the (1989 US)
invasion.'
The decision was announced as the general's defence rested its case.
Prosecutors yesterday began to present a rebuttal case in which several

If convicted on 10 drug and racketeering counts, Gen Noriega could get up to
140 years in prison.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN GREENSPAN, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, yesterday urged
Congress to give the US central bank the authority to pay interest on the
reserves that banks must hold at the Fed.
Mr Greenspan's request, expressed in a letter to Mr Steve Neal, chairman of
the House of Representatives subcommittee on domestic monetary policy, comes
just a few weeks after the Federal Reserve reduced the reserve requirement
for banks from 12 to 10 per cent of their balances.
Although a technical matter, the treatment of reserve requirements is seen
by analysts as a tool that Mr Greenspan can use to help banks o bolster bank
profitability at a time when the crisis in commercial real estate has caused
heavy bad debt provisions at many banks.
The Fed chief argued yesterday that paying interest to banks on what are
known as 'sterile reserves' would benefit the US banking system. Mr
Greenspan said if the Fed had been able to pay interest on such balances it
would not have been necessary last month to lower the reserve requirement to
10 per cent.
'It would have been preferable to have kept the reserve ratio at 12 per cent
and to pay interest on required reserve balances than to take the ratio to
10 per cent without paying interest,' Mr Greenspan said.
The lower reserve requirement could induce 'undesirable volatility' in the
Federal funds market if the required balances were to fall too low, he said.

A TOTAL of 19 companies and consortia, including BP and Shell, have tendered
to operate inactive oil fields in Venezuela, in the first attempt to open up
the country's oil industry to foreign investment since it was nationalised
in 1976.
Over the last 16 years, private companies have not been allowed to work in
the production of Venezuelan crude oil.
The national oil company, PDVSA, asked for bids on 55 inactive oil fields in
nine different geographical areas. Bids were made for five of the areas.
PDVSA estimates probable reserves in the nine areas stand at 357m barrels,
while possible reserves are 1.17bn barrels.
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez appointed two political opponents
to his cabinet yesterday in a reshuffle designed to broaden his support and
overcome a leadership crisis, Reuter reports from Caracas.
The president, under pressure to resign since a failed February 4 coup
attempt, shuffled seven ministers as part of a promise to cobble form a
national unity government.
He appointed Mr Humberto Calderon Berti, a former oil minister and Opec
president, as foreign minister and Mr Jose Ignacio Moreno Leon, was made
president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund. Both were members of the
opposition COPEI party.

A FEDERAL judge dismissed a constitutional challenge by insurance companies
which are resisting state regulations that seek Dollars 2.5bn in rate

Proposition 103, approved by voters in 1988, required all property-casualty

that insurers are entitled to a fair profit.
'We are moving full speed ahead with fully implementing Proposition 103 and

Commissioner John Garamendi said of the latest ruling.
The ruling did not resolve insurers' claims that Garamendi's rules violated

FT  11 MAR 92 / Bush could lose to a Democrat, poll finds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the first time a leading public opinion poll has found that President
George Bush could be beaten in November by the two Democratic party
front-runners, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Senator Paul
Tsongas of Massachusetts.
The poll also showed Mr Bush's overall approval rating dropping below 40 per
cent, among the lowest scores recorded by an incumbent at this point of a
presidency. Most of the erosion in his support came from registered
Republicans.
Also taking the edge off what should be a series of victories in the Super
Tuesday primaries held yesterday, Mr Bush found his administration on the
receiving end of a blast from former president Richard Nixon for its
'pathetically inadequate' response in assisting the former Soviet Union. Mr
Bush said he did not take Mr Nixon's criticisms 'personally'.
Several recent surveys have suggested Mr Bush could lose to an unnamed
Democrat, but have found him comfortably ahead when the opposition was
identified in person. The Washington Post/ABC News poll of 1,030 randomly
selected adults, conducted from March 4-8, put him behind Mr Clinton by 46
to 44 per cent and behind Mr Tsongas by a wider margin of 47 to 42 per cent,
both subject to a sampling error of plus or minus 4 per cent.
The poll is, of course, only a snapshot of sentiment at a time when Mr Bush
has been receiving generally poor political reviews for his campaign
performance. But it also indicates that both Mr Clinton and Mr Tsongas, the
main Super Tuesday Democratic rivals, are becoming much better known
nationally.
But the drop in the president's overall rating (39 per cent approving, 58
per cent not, against 46-49 per cent in the previous survey a month before)
invites comparisons with previous presidents seeking relection. In the
spring of 1948, Harry Truman was down to 36 per cent, but won in November;
in 1968 Lyndon Johnson scored only 41 per cent, and withdrew; in 1976 Gerald
Ford was at 50 per cent, and lost; while in 1980 Jimmy Carter was also at 39
per cent, and was defeated.
Mr Bush does not want particularly to be reminded of previous presidents at
present. Mr Ronald Reagan has been conspicuously unhelpful by not quashing
the uprising on the Republican right, while Mr Nixon's intervention
yesterday serves as a reminder of sharp divisions inside the foreign policy
establishment.
Arguing for much greater financial and humanitarian assistance for Russia,
Mr Nixon wrote: 'The hot button issue in the 1950s was 'who lost China?' If
Yeltsin goes down, the question 'who lost Russia?' will be an infinitely
more devastating issue in the 1990s.'

</HEADLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHITE extremists in South Africa have threatened more attacks on President
FW de Klerk during the campaign for next week's referendum, after a teargas
bomb forced him to flee a campaign meeting on Monday night.
The threats, issued by the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement) (AWB),
highlight the security risk involved in the style of campaigning chosen by
Mr de Klerk: informal walkabouts in shopping centres and university
campuses, and impromptu meetings with the public. A presidential spokesman
said there would be no change in his programme despite the attack.
Mr de Klerk is always flanked by several National party officials during his
campaign strolls, but normally by only one plain-clothes security officer.
(Others accompany his motorcade.) Whites and blacks alike crowd close to the
president in cramped quarters, in an attempt to see him and shake his hand.
Those accompanying his tour have expressed concern that such events provide
ample opportunity for an assassin.
Monday's attack, in which Mr Kobie Coetsee, justice minister, was
temporarily blinded, was carried out during a meeting with students at the
University of the Orange Free State in ultra-conservative Bloemfontein,
where Mr de Klerk was campaigning for a 'yes' vote in next Tuesday's poll on
political reform.
A local National party official said he recognised the attackers as members
of the AWB.
They yelled 'Baboon, go back to the mountains' and 'Traitor go home' before
lobbing the tear gas bomb. Mr de Klerk and his wife Marike were hustled out
of the hall by security men without injury.
Yesterday Mr Piet Rudolf, AWB spokesman, said Mr de Klerk could expect more
such attacks, though he denied AWB involvement in the Bloemfontein incident.
'He cannot refer to the AWB as Nazis and fascists without expecting some
revenge,' he said.
Mr de Klerk had earlier used those terms in condemning the right wing, which
is campaigning for a 'no' vote in the referendum.
It was the first big disruption of his campaign since it began eight days
ago.
The attack highlights the degree to which reform depends on the security of
two individuals, Mr de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African
National Congress.
Yesterday Mr Mandela was at pains to reassure whites, ahead of the
referendum, that civil servants and security force members would not lose
their jobs under an ANC government, though some might be retired on
'favourable and secure terms.'
He said the ANC would not be influenced by Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe's plans to nationalise white farmland. 'We will be influenced by our
own conditions, not those of Zimbabwe,' he told local newspapers. 'Zimbabwe
believes in a one-party state. We believe in a multi-party state.'

FT  11 MAR 92 / Iraq sets out to exploit UN's lack of options: Mark
Nicholson on prospects for today's meeting in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER happens at today's meeting between an Iraqi delegation led by Mr
Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime minister, and members of the United Nations
Security Council, the two sides are certain to agree on nothing of
substance.
The purpose of the New York visit - the first time a senior Iraqi minister
has set foot in the US since the Gulf war - is to tell the council that
Baghdad is complying with the UN ceasefire resolutions which demand the
elimination of its weapons of mass destruction.
Last night in New York Mr Aziz appealed for sanctions against Iraq to be
lifted. After briefing Third World members of the UN, he said that, now
Baghdad had met its obligations, the UN should relieve the 'severe
hardships' the trade embargo imposed on 18m Iraqi citizens.
Today Mr Aziz, in the hope of loosening UN resolve over sustaining the
embargo, will publicise the effect on Iraq of 20 months of economic
sanctions. Iraq yesterday released a Health Ministry report claiming that
more than 21,000 people, 8,000 of them children under five, have died in the
first two months of this year from food and drug shortages. The report also
says that the embargo has cost 120,000 Iraqi lives in all.
However, council members, most vocally the US, Britain and France, will
insist that Iraq is in grave breach of the ceasefire resolutions and that,
unless it both reveals more of its weapons programmes and destroys what has
been found, 'serious consequences' will ensue. Dark warnings of a military
strike will be uttered.
Members will also reprimand Iraq over its internal economic blockade of the
Kurds in the north of the country and its mistreatment of Shia Moslems in
the south and insist that it release hundreds of remaining Kuwaiti hostages.
And, into the bargain, they will ask why Iraq has refused to sell Dollars
1.6bn-worth of oil to buy food and medicine under a special UN dispensation
 -one which runs out on March 19. Iraq argues that the embargo infringes its
sovereignty.
Today's meeting will thus cover familiar ground, and there is nothing to
indicate that it will do anything to soften familiar Iraqi intransigence: it
is more likely to highlight the UN's difficulties in forcing Iraqi
compliance.
The victorious Gulf war allies are considering all possible means of
tightening the squeeze, short of the ultimate sanction of a further military
strike. But options are limited.
One suggestion that has emerged from within the US administration is to
seize Iraq's Dollars 5bn of overseas assets and use the money to pay for the
UN Special Commission charged with investigating and destroying Iraq's
weapons programmes, offer relief aid to the Kurds and Shias and pay some
compensation to Kuwait.
While this proposal might appear to be able to kill a flock of birds with
one stone, Britain and France argue that it would present insurmountable
legal problems to enforce. 'This one's not going anywhere,' a British
official said.
Another suggestion is that the council should seize, and similarly spend,
Iraq's Dollars 300m deposit with the Basle-based Bank for International
Settlements. But this also is unlikely to win favour, not least because
Switzerland is not part of the UN.
Other proposals being aired include the dispatch of UN human rights monitors
to Iraq and the possible extension of the protection zone for the Kurds in
northern Iraq further south of the 36th parallel.
Short of an outright attack, however, there appears to be few effective
courses of action apart from hoping that the threat of a strike, combined
with intensified military manoeuvres in the Gulf, will frighten Iraq's
leadership into compliance.
But the west knows that Mr Saddam is not easily frightened or bluffed. It
also knows that, even given sufficient political support in the UN for a
further military raid, an attack would not necessarily push Mr Saddam into
compliance.
A strike might destroy weapons and the manufacturing sites which UN
inspectors have discovered, but this would only deter Iraq from revealing
further components of the weapons and nuclear programmes that UN inspectors
are sure it is hiding.
Furthermore, the domestic political consequences for the election-conscious
governments of the US and Britain would be appealing only insofar as a raid
succeeded immediately either in bringing Iraq to heel or, perhaps, in
toppling Mr Saddam's regime.
UN officials acknowledge that there is little more to be done in the
medium-term beyond doggedly and intrusively pursuing further details of
Iraq's nuclear and weapons programmes on the ground.
Another team of nuclear experts will enter Iraq early next month, and a team
of chemical weapons inspectors is at work this week destroying more than 450
damaged chemical warheads.
'Our very presence there is a hindrance (to Iraqi plans),' said a UN
official, but 'there's very little else we can practically do, but make
plain to Iraq that it's not just the UK and US, but the entire Security
Council which will not consider lifting sanctions until Iraq complies.'

FT  11 MAR 92 / Ivory trade ban to remain despite African objections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL bans on the trade of elephant and rhinoceros products will
remain in place, despite impassioned pleas yesterday from southern African
nations that a relaxation would be in the best interests of the two
threatened species.
The triennial conference of the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (Cites) also agreed not to impose limits on trade in
Atlantic bluefin tuna, though Japan and other leading fishing nations
promised to reduce their catching of the fish.
At least two southern African governments, Botswana and Zimbabwe, threatened
to withdraw from the organisation after it became clear that a vast majority
of the 114 Cites member states opposed the lifting of a three-year ban on
trade in ivory and other elephant parts.
Both delegations argued that they could raise funds to expand their existing
elephant conservation programmes through limited international sales of
elephant hide and meat, and that a moratorium on trade in ivory would be
maintained for at least the next two years. A disappointed Botswana said
that it would now 'weigh the costs and benefits of Cites membership'.
While most other delegates were confident that the two governments will not
withdraw, their threat highlighted conflicts among Cites members in defining
'sustainable trade' in wildlife, particularly on emotional issues such as
the elephant.
Zimbabwe also argued that a limited trade in rhinoceros horns would enable
the country to bolster a campaign against heavily armed poachers whose
slaughter of the species has intensified over the past years. Delegates from
Zimbabwe said that 'we shoot people to protect rhinos' and that 'we place
the survival of the rhino population above the survival of the Cites rules'.
The bluefin tuna debate has provoked a strong reaction within Japan, the
consumer of three quarters of the bluefin exported from the western
Atlantic, most of which is used to make sushi. After a week of intense
public pressure from industry groups and of furious lobbying by Tokyo, the
Swedish government yesterday withdrew its proposal to ban trade in the
western Atlantic variety, though it did extract promises of reduced catches.
Japan, supported by the US, Canada and Morocco, had argued that an existing
body, the International Commission for Conservation of Atlantic Tuna, is
successfully monitoring bluefin stocks, and that Cites should not impose
restrictions.
The tuna argument highlighted the growing problem of Cites overlapping
existing trade monitoring organisations, often industry-run. This was also
shown in a debate on a Netherlands proposal limiting trade in two species of
tropical timbers, which it argued should fall within Cites's jurisdiction.
However, Malaysia, a large exporter of tropical timbers, said the proposal
was 'ill-conceived' and that Cites 'should not be used as a tool to
straitjacket international trade in timber'. The Malaysian government
insists that the International Tropical Timber Organisation is responsible
for overseeing that trade.

FT  11 MAR 92 / South African business swings behind a 'yes' vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICANS are wild about cricket, and ecstatic about their team's
recent triumphs in the World Cup. But instead of hailing victory,
yesterday's South African newspapers carried an advert picturing an
overgrown cricket field with broken wickets and a torn ball.
The message: a 'no' vote in next week's referendum will mean that South
Africa will again be shut out of international sport. 'Without reform, South
Africa hasn't got a sporting chance.'
The full-page advert was funded, not by the ruling National party, but by
South African business which is spending R3.4m (Pounds 680,000) to campaign
for a 'yes' vote in the referendum on political reform next Tuesday. Some
two thirds of the 'yes' camp's total advertising budget is coming from
businessmen who fear that their chance of returning to world markets will be
sabotaged, yet again, by politics.
The political liberalisation of the past two years has already made a huge
difference to the lives of most white businessmen.
They have been welcomed abroad, where before they were shunned; they have
glimpsed a light at the end of the 40-year tunnel of apartheid isolation.
Now they are terrified that a vote in favour of reintroducing apartheid will
provoke unprecedented international retribution. 'A 'no' vote would be a
guarantee for disaster,' says Mr P F Retief, chairman of Johannesburg
Consolidated Investments, one of the largest mining houses. He has written
to white employees to urge a 'yes' vote.
'If we cannot sell our production because of re-imposed sanctions, both your
job and my job will be threatened. If money flees the country, interest
rates will be raised even higher and the recession will deepen. Unemployment
will rise further with all its consequences ..like the crime and violence we
are already experiencing and this will certainly worsen,' he argues in his
letter.
Mr Peter Mackenzie, director of the Private Sector Referendum Fund, insists
the campaign is 'non party-political'. It was launched by one of the
country's largest media groups, Times Media, and has had contributions from
across the white bus-iness spectrum, not to mention offers of help from
black business as well.
Residual suspicion of white South Africa has hampered the fund's
international campaign - the Toronto Globe and Mail refused to print an
advert urging expatriate South Africans in Canada to vote 'yes'. The fund
also bought billboards at the World Cup cricket grounds - matches are widely
televised in South Africa - and distributed pro-reform T-shirts to fans. But
the billboards were withdrawn when a rival group tried to purchase
advertising for the 'no' camp.
Mr Mackenzie says the campaign's adverts are about to become 'more dramatic
and blunt'.
The toughest advert so far had an ironic twist to it, though: it showed an
operating table littered with used gauze and broken needles, and the message
'without reform, South Africa won't get better'.
For many whites, those are the images associated with health care in
independent African countries. Many believe they can avoid such a fate by
reaffirming apartheid - not by voting 'yes' for reform.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Thailand's election raises the price of corruption / A look
at some unusual alliances and the country's traditional polling practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE of a Thai citizen's vote has risen sharply in brisk trading ahead
of the country's general election on March 22.
Record offers of between 800 baht and 1,000 baht (Pounds 18 to Pounds 23)
for a single vote have been reported from the hotly contested northern
region of Chiang Mai, reflecting four years of spectacular economic growth
in Thailand since the last election in 1988.
Many politicians, according to the Thai press, are also once again hiring
professional liars at 200 baht a day to sit in coffee shops and spread
malicious rumours about their opponents.
The more sophisticated and powerful politicians - notorious for sudden
switches of allegiance from one ideologically empty party to another in
exchange for multi-million-baht transfer fees - can choose the more
efficient method of vote-buying by purchasing officials at polling stations.
This practice, known as 'booth-buying', has prompted the electoral
authorities to threaten last-minute staff swaps between constituencies. More
ominously, at least five people have been killed in violence related to the
election campaign, some of them local party canvassers shot dead on the
orders of their rivals.
In short, the election promises to be typically Thai. It is being held on
the instructions of the National Peacekeeping Council (NPKC), the military
junta which, citing excessive corruption, overthrew a year ago last month
the elected government of General Chatichai Choonhavan in Thailand's 18th
coup or coup attempt.
As canvassers from the 15 competing parties tour the countryside in vans
mounted with loudspeakers and life-size posters of the candidates - many of
them sporting military uniforms dripping medals and gold braid - Thais are
debating some of the ironies of their topsy-turvy world.
When the military took over they were so anxious to show their good
intentions that they installed an eminently respectable interim government
led by Cambridge-educated Anand Panyarachun as prime minister.
He and his cabinet colleagues promptly pursued their own agenda of economic
reform and declined to authorise the purchase of all the new aircraft
demanded by the air force. Yet they could hardly be removed without acute
embarrassment for the junta.
Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, air force head and deputy chairman of the
NPKC, announced last month that the NPKC was dissatisfied, complaining that,
'when the government refused to obey, we did not know what to do'.
The junta then added to the confusion by making electoral alliances with the
very politicians that it accused of corruption and overthrew last year.
Samakki Tham, or Justice Unity, a new party formed after the coup by the
military to promote the military, has joined forces with Chat Thai - Gen
Chatichai's old fiefdom - and the Social Action Party.
The Assets Examination Committee, established after the coup with the
professed aim of tracking down the corrupt earnings of members of the
Chatichai government, investigated 25 people, declared 10 of them to be
'unusually wealthy" and ordered the confiscation of 1.9bn baht in assets.
However, the junta let them appeal in the courts and continue in politics,
with the result that eight of the ten are standing in the election and may
have the chance to grant themselves a pardon in a new government. 'Unusually
wealthy' politicians are prominent in the alliance of pro-military parties.
The moral high ground has proved equally elusive for the loose group of
parties which are openly critical of military intervention in politics (and
which are themselves dominated by retired generals). This is largely because
the un-elected Anand government installed by the armed forces has proved to
be one of the most competent the country has known.
Mr Anand's cabinet has earned the respect of businessmen for implementing a
series of much-needed economic reforms, although liberals have criticised it
for crippling the labour movement by banning trade unions in state
enterprises.
The administration's solid performance has taken the sting out of the
anti-NPKC statements of the Democrats, the New Aspiration Party and Palang
Dharma, the Bangkok-based party led by Gen Chamlong Srimuang, a devout
Buddhist and popular ex-mayor who goes by the nickname 'Mr Clean.'
No party is likely to get close to an outright majority in the 360-seat
House of Representatives. Liberals argue that the prime minister should at
least be an elected member of parliament, rather than a military appointee,
and the election will probably be followed by a period of intense
horse-trading, with the transport, communications and commerce port-folios
regarded as prizes because they offer exceptional opportunities for graft as
the country's inadequate infrastructure is developed.
Air Chief Marshal Somboon Rahong, now leader of the Chat Thai party, and Gen
Suchinda Kraprayoon, the army commander, are being tipped as possible prime
ministers of a coalition government sympathetic to the military.
In any event, the armed forces have little reason to fear the election.
Under a new constitution devised by the military, Gen Sunthorn Kongsompong,
the NPKC chairman, will appoint a 270-member Senate on election day which
will have the right to vote together with the elected lower house in
no-confidence debates, and thereby give pro-military parties a strong
influence over the choice of a prime minister.
If all else fails, the military could always stage a coup d'etat.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA'S foreign minister, Mr Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, yesterday summoned
the Burmese ambassador in Kuala Lumpur to express concern over Rangoon's
treatment of its Moslem minority.
Its action was a sign of increasing international concern about events on
Burma's western border with Bangladesh. Up to 170,000 Burmese Moslems, known
as Rohingyas, have crossed into Bangladesh since last December, telling of
widespread atrocities by Burmese troops.
Burma's south-east Asian neighbours have been reluctant to exert pressure on
the military government in Rangoon to curtail human rights abuses, adopting
a policy which they describe as 'constructive engagement'.
The regime, which is also engaged in a battle with insurgents near its
eastern border with Thailand, ignored a 1990 election victory by an
opposition party and is detaining its leader, Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, who was
awarded the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize.
According to the British Red Cross, 5,000 or more refugees, mainly the
elderly and women and children, are crossing into Bangladesh each day. Oxfam
says that a new camp should be built each day to accommodate the inflow, and
that the situation could worsen with the rainy season two months away. The
UN High Commissioner for Refugees has drawn up a Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.3m)
aid programme.
In Bangladesh yesterday, refugees said that Burmese soldiers had killed
hundreds of Moslems and detained thousands in western Arakan state in the
past two weeks.
Rangoon says the Rohingyas are not Burmese nationals and will not be allowed
to return.

THE PHILIPPINES has made surprisingly little use of aid pledged by

Of pledges totalling Dollars 2.87bn (Pounds 1.67bn) made in 1989, some 39.4
per cent or Dollars 1.13bn had been disbursed by the end of 1991, and of
pledges of Dollars 3.23bn at the 1991 meeting, only 19.6 per cent or Dollars
633m had been disbursed as of December.
The slow rate of use will be the main focus at the next session of debt
talks, chaired by the World Bank and beginning in Hong Kong tomorrow. Donors
are expected to review the performance of the outgoing administration of
President Corazon Aquino. Elections are due on May 11.
Leading donors are likely to commit themselves to continued support at least
in the transition period to the new administration. The World Bank is
expected to pledge up to Dollars 900m of new financial assistance.
Mr Jesus Estanislao, finance secretary, is expected to explain that the
government was hamstrung by a delay in congressional approval for last
year's budget and difficulties in raising local counterpart financing for
foreign assistance.
He will seek financial support for a debt reduction programme recently
agreed with leading commercial bank creditors. Over the long term, he will
seek commitments to programmes including power and water projects,
environmental issues and poverty alleviation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GHANA's trading partners in Gatt yesterday welcomed its 'substantial
progress' in liberalising its economy but urged further reforms, Frances
Williams reports from Geneva.
They acknowledged a more open economy made Ghana more dependent on better
access to foreign markets and a strengthened international trading system,
and thus on a successful end to the Uruguay Round.
A report on Ghana's trade policies by the Gatt secretariat, discussed
yesterday by its governing council, said sweeping reforms since 1983 had
made a highly protectionist economy an outward-looking one. In face of
constraints posed by Ghana's dependence on primary commodities and high
indebtedness, the reforms had succeeded in improving economic efficiency and
reviving the traded-goods sector.
Cocoa still accounts for about half Ghana's export receipts. Half Ghana's
trade is with the EC, which gives preferential access to its cocoa and other
agricultural exports under the Lome Convention. Ghana's reforms have
included several currency devaluations and introduction of a market-based
exchange rate system.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Canadian cabinet will today consider retaliatory action against the US
for a 14.5 per cent duty imposed by the Commerce Department last week on
softwood lumber exports from Canada.
The lumber ruling, coming on top of several other trade rows between Ottawa
and Washington, has increased political pressure on Mr Brian Mulroney,
Canada's prime minister, to hit back at the Americans. Both opposition
parties have called for retaliatory measures. Mr Bob Rae, Ontario's premier,
urged Mr Mulroney to work more closely with other countries hurt by US
protectionism.
Although Canada is the US's biggest market, with imports totalling CDollars
93bn (Pounds 45bn) last year, Ottawa is hesitant to take any measures which
could widen trade frictions. In an interview with the Financial Times last
week, Mr Mulroney said: 'I'm not big on gunboat diplomacy, but we are not
without our own resources'.
The Canadians want to avoid any action which would jeopardise the 1989 free
trade agreement with the US, or the present round of trilateral talks
including Mexico to create a North American free trade area (Nafta). Mr
Mulroney, President George Bush and President Salinas de Gortari of Mexico
are due to discuss progress in the Nafta talks by phone next Monday.
Canada has already lodged a complaint with Gatt over the softwood lumber
duty, imposed to compensate for the alleged subsidy to Canadian sawmills of
low tree-cutting fees in provincial forests and curbs on log exports. Ottawa
also plans to refer the lumber issue to a binational dispute settlement
panel under the 1989 US-Canada free trade pact. It is expected to call for a
panel to consider the recent US Customs Service decision that Honda cars
assembled in Ontario do not have enough North American content to qualify
for duty-free access under the FTA.
The extra duty on Canadian lumber has halted export orders from the US for
the time being. Mr Roy Carroll, president of Angus Forest Products, a
Toronto-based wholesaler, said sawmills in British Columbia, Ontario and
Quebec have raised prices 15 per cent since last Friday.
US buyers bought heavily ahead of the ruling, and are thought to have
substantial inventories. Many US home-builders have rallied to the
Canadians' side, noting the extra duty imposed at a time of strong demand
could raise the price of an average home by about Dollars 1,000 (Pounds
568). Canadian sawmills export more than CDollars 3bn of lumber a year south
of the border and have roughly 25 per cent of the US market.

THE US yesterday presented the European Community with a new offer to break
the farm subsidy impasse in the stalled Uruguay Round of world trade
liberalisation talks.
But after Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, handed him a letter from
President George Bush, Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, said:
'We are still not on the same terrain'.
The offer apparently allows the EC more scope to go ahead with proposed
financial compensation to European farmers for cutting food output.
Mr Baker quipped about the 'extraordinarily generous offer', but Mr Delors
said the US scheme still did not meet EC complaints about the cuts in
internal price support and export volume contained in the negotiating paper
of Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt secretary-general.
This seeks a 36 per cent reduction in price support, while the EC has
offered 30 per cent and wants no quantitative curbs on farm export volume.
US and EC officials meet today on the proposals.

subsidies

   WASHINGTON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WASHINGTON yesterday rejected an EC report that indirect US subsidies to its
aircraft industry should be considered in tandem with European government
underwriting of the Airbus.
The Commerce Department said an inter-agency review of the EC report had
concluded:
The US did not engage in 'massive, systematic support' of its commercial
aircraft industry; this constituted 'old, discredited claims' first made by
Airbus Industrie in 1988;
US policies were not designed to provide 'direct or indirect' commercial
advantages to specific companies or projects through defence and aerospace
R&amp;D contracts;
The EC report was described as a blatant attempt to deflect attention from
current talks on Airbus subsidies;
The report greatly exaggerated 'crossover' or spin-off benefits to the US
industry, while ignoring similar benefits accruing in Europe for Europe.
Last month, the US gave the EC until March 31 to agree a plan to cut
subsidies to Airbus Industrie. The US considers its case has been
strengthened by the Gatt ruling in January condemning German exchange-rate
support for Deutsche Airbus, the German partner in the consortium.
Yesterday, the Commerce Department restated its belief that the subsidies
issue had to be resolved. 'US industry cannot continue to compete against
European Treasuries,' an official said.
Airbus Industrie has said it will retaliate if the US tries to step up
pressure on the European aircraft consortium in the dispute over subsidies
to aircraft builders, AP reports from Paris. Airbus's chief executive Jean
Pierson told Le Monde that US negotiators had made 'outrageous' new demands
for financial 'transparency' last month.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Disillusion swells tide of protest votes: France's
mainstream parties are likely to be the losers in regional elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH less than a fortnight before polling day in the French regional
elections, the ruling socialists seem to be failing to reverse a tide which
is running heavily against them.
Senior ministers have been conscripted to lead the socialist campaign in the
22 regions of France, but their efforts appear to be making no impact on
opinion polls.
These point to a steep drop in the socialist vote to 20 per cent or less.
This compares with nearly 30 per cent in the previous regional elections in
1986, and almost 35 per cent in the first round of the 1988 general
elections.
The socialist setback does not seem to be doing the traditional conservative
parties any good, however, and the main beneficiary is Mr Jean-Marie Le
Pen's extreme right-wing National Front. The most detailed surveys point to
a nationwide tally of 13.5 per cent for the NF, and the latest poll suggests
the NF is gaining support. Neck-and-neck with the NF are the two ecological
movements.
The pattern thus emerging from the polls is of a disavowal of the
traditional mainstream political parties in favour of eccentric protest
parties.
So far, the socialists do not appear to have a clear plan to ward off the
impending popular rejection. They have been divided over whether these are
genuinely regional contests to be campaigned for regionally, or whether they
are really a national contest, in effect a trial run for next year's general
elections.
Their initial response to the rise of the National Front was to go on the
offensive against Mr Le Pen in his home ground in the south of France. The
standard-bearer chosen for this offensive was Mr Bernard Tapie, the populist
businessman who established his local credentials by buying the Marseilles
football team, and by winning a local parliamentary seat.
Mr Tapie has expended much of his brash energy, and attracted a lot of media
attention, with a stream of insults aimed at Mr Le Pen and his supporters.
'If Mr Le Pen is a bastard (salaud),' he has said, 'those who vote for him
are bastards too'. For good measure, Mr Tapie has also been directing his
street invective against Mr Jean-Claude Gaudin, the centre-right incumbent
chairman of the local Provence-Alpes-Cotes d'Azur (Paca) regional council,
whom he accuses of preparing an infamous pact with Mr Le Pen.
Mr Tapie's braggadocio seems to have been without effect. The polls suggest
Mr Le Pen will break all records in the Paca region, with 27 per cent of the
vote, whereas Mr Tapie's list is likely to trail in third with only 18 per
cent. Last week he conceded ruefully: 'I was mistaken in my campaign. The
electorate of Le Pen is more convinced and motivated, and the others do not
feel concerned.'
Moreover, the socialist campaign against Mr Le Pen seems to have backfired
nationally. It has precipitated demonstrations and counter-demonstrations,
and led some local authorities to ban public meetings planned by Mr Le Pen.
The resulting uproar has been so much free publicity for the National Front,
and even though the mayor of Lyons this week refused to let Le Pen use a
local hall, most of the mainstream politicians have publicly conceded that
it is better to allow his meetings to take place.
One result is that Mr Laurent Fabius, leader of the Socialist Party, has
tried to cool political passions by appealing for regional campaigning to
take place on regional issues. Local factors, such as the presence of a
large immigrant community, undoubtedly play a large part in Mr Le Pen's
prospects of success in the south of France. Conversely, the socialists have
strong industrial roots in Nord-Pas-de-Calais, one of only two regions which
they control, though even here they are on the defensive against the
challenge of the ecologists.
Yet polls show that most voters are influenced by national considerations,
such as unemployment. This is not surprising, because regional
decentralisation is only a decade old, and still rather tentative. The
biggest share of regional budgets is secondary education and training, but
regional responsibilities extend only to the buildings of the secondary
schools; education proper is still decided in Paris.
As a result, most analysts are treating these elections as if they were a
national opinion survey. Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister, has led the
national campaign with extended apologies for the socialists' eleven-year
record in office, and Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, has rebuked
the electorate for its failure to understand the strengths of the national
economy and the achievements of his economic policy.
The strongest proof that this is indeed a national not a regional election
is that the party and the government have sent most of the cabinet out on
the campaign trail, many of them against their will. But few expect these
efforts to make a radical difference to the verdict.
Paradoxically, the rise in protest votes could produce perverse results. The
mainstream conservative parties can expect to come out in front in most
regions, as at present. But as they are simultaneously likely to lose ground
in many of these regions, they may have difficulty in putting together
regional council majorities.
Since they have publicly undertaken not to do deals with the National Front,
the deciding voice may well lie with the ecologists. In some cases the
ecologists may do a deal with the socialists; so the socialists could
increase the number of regions they control, even if their national score
collapses dramatically.

FT  11 MAR 92 / St Petersburg sounds the alert on wages

INDUSTRIAL managers in St Petersburg, Russia's second largest city,
yesterday warned of an explosion of worker discontent unless the government
gave them Rbs2bn to pay wages for March.
The rumblings from St Petersburg, a centre of support for both Lenin in 1917
and for Mr Yeltsin during last August's coup, is the latest of a series of
angry signals bombarding the Russian government as it tries to push through
austerity policies.
Mr Gennady Burbulis, first deputy prime minister, said yesterday a
government commission would go to the Kuzbass mining area, where bus drivers
and teachers have threatened a strike unless they receive pay rises equal to
the tripling of miners' pay. Meanwhile Mr Alfred Malinovsky, chairman of
Russia's pilots' union, said 70 per cent of pilots were prepared to strike
on March 25 unless demands for a pay rise and better working conditions were
met.
Mr Viktor Kharchenko, chairman of the Union of Industrial Enterprises, which
groups about 30 of St Petersburg's biggest state enterprises, said managers
already owed Rbs18bn to banks.
Mr Kharchenko, who also heads the Baltic Shipping Company, said defence
enterprises accounting for 70 per cent of the city's heavy industry should
be allowed to export arms to help them survive.
The dilemma of Mr Vyacheslav Petrov, manager of the Arsenal artillery plant,
is typical of the problems facing defence plants around the country as a
result of a cut in military procurement to 13 per cent of last year's level.
Mr Petrov borrowed Rbs30m from the bank in February to pay wages and make up
for the fact that several customers had failed to pay for deliveries. Talks
with potential foreign investors on helping him convert more of his defence
output to civilian uses have produced no results.
'Time will run out before they wake up,' he said. Unless he gets funds from
the state, Mr Petrov will have to sack some of his 3,500 workers involved in
defence production. Another 5,500 people are already involved in the
production of consumer goods at his factory thanks to partial conversion.
But even conversion is not necessarily a key to salvation. The mighty Kirov
plant, which over recent years has managed to switch from tanks to tractors,
is unable to sell its tractors for lack of key components. This shortfall is
just one symptom of the disruptions in deliveries between factories, despite
a variety of government incentives to facilitate the output of agricultural
machinery. A shortfall in steel production has led to predictions of a 30
per cent fall in the output of tractors and other agricultural equipment.
THE pro-Russian commander of the Black Sea fleet yesterday condemned the
decision by 58 officers and seamen aboard one of the fleet's biggest battle
cruisers to swear allegiance to Ukraine, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. A
spokesman for Admiral Igor Kasatonov said the oath, taken on Sunday, had
been instigated by the deputy commander of the battleship Admiral Kutuzov in
the absence of the commander.
'We consider such acts to be impermissible and a destructive force,' he
said. The oath, taken by less than half the 136 serving officers and men
aboard, defied a ban by Admiral Kasatonov against any swearing of allegiance
to Ukraine until Russian and Ukraine leaders have resolved the status of the
fleet.
Ukrainian claims to the fleet have collided with Russia's insistence that
the bulk of the force remain under the collective control of the
Commonwealth of Independent States. The Ukrainian government has urged
Admiral Kasatonov's dismissal.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Treuhand finds buyers for three shipyards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE TREUHAND privatisation agency has secured its last major sale, finding
buyers for eastern Germany's troubled shipbuilding industry.
It said yesterday three of the five large companies belonging to the
state-owned Deutsche Maschinen- und Schiffbau are to be sold to Kvaener, a
Norwegian group and to Bremer Vulkan of western Germany. The Treuhand is
also talking to Danish and Norwegian buyers to sell the other two yards.
Kvaerner is to buy the Warnow and Neptun yards, east Germany's largest
shipyards, based in the Rostock area. Bremer Vulkan is to take over the MTW
shipyard in Wismar, and DMR, a diesel engine producer based in Rostock.
Mrs Birgit Breuel, Treuhand president, said the decision to sell the core of
the industry to the two companies had been 'one of the most difficult the
agency has had to make'.
The European Commission will have to examine the sale because state funds
are involved. The Treuhand, whose governing board is expected to approve the
sales next Tuesday, said it was confident the Commission would approve the
level of state aid needed.
The state government of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where the yards are based,
said yesterday it would unveil a restructuring plan for the industry today.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, said last week that any
plans for the shipyards would have to include a basic restructuring plan
before the Commission could consider approving the level of state aid.
Brussels officials are seeking assurances that the restructuring would be
sufficiently realistic to make the yards competitive by the end of 1993,
when all state aid to shipbuilding in the Community is to be abolished.
The Treuhand said the number of workers in the three shipyards would be
reduced from 10,300 to 7,000.
Thousands of shipyard workers are to demonstrate today outside the
parliament of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern which is to debate and approve its plan
for the shipbuilding industry.
Tough negotiations with the companies are likely to take place over the
amount of state subsidy. The Treuhand previously indicated it was prepared
to assume more than DM1bn (Pounds 300m) in shipyard debts as well as a much
of the DM900m investment needed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN inflation, at 4.3 per cent, is still too high to allow the Bundesbank
to cut interest rates, according to criteria laid down by a leading banker
in Bonn yesterday.
Mr Friedel Neuber, chairman of the Westdeutsche Landesbank, the biggest Land
(state) bank in Germany, said the German economy would recover during the
year and the Bundesbank would be able to ease interest rates a little.
However, the timing of the reduction depended mainly on developments in
prices and pay. 'An inflation rate of 4 per cent cannot be tolerated,' he
added.
His comments followed an announcement from the federal statistics office
that a 0.6 per cent rise in consumer prices last month had pushed annual
inflation in west Germany to 4.3 per cent, compared with 4 per cent in
January.
The climate in the current pay round is also unpromising, with most unions
claiming around 10 per cent.
However, banking workers, who have disrupted business for the past two weeks
with scattered strikes in pursuit of their 10.5 per cent demand, showed
signs yesterday that they would accept the employers' offer of renewed
talks.
Public service unions, meanwhile, launched a threatened wave of warning
strikes with a demonstration by 500 workers in Berlin. Claiming a 10.5 per
cent increase, the 2.3m workers have been offered 3.5 per cent by federal
and state employers.
IG Metall, representing around 4m engineering employees, meanwhile said that
the Gesamtmetall employers' association was on a catastrophe course. Mr
Hans-Joachim Gottschol, Gesamtmetall's president has suggested that a
maximum of 2 per cent would be 'economically reasonable.' The union is
claiming 9.5 per cent.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday promised to maintain
strict budget discipline, rein in federal spending and reduce the state
deficit.

<TEXT>
NATO and its former adversaries in the Commonwealth of Independent States
and eastern Europe agreed in Brusselsyesterday on a joint initiative to halt
the bloody fighting in the ethnically mixed Caucasus region of
Nagorno-Karabakh.
Under the plan, adopted by the 35-nation Nato Co-operation Council (NACC),
Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the Czechoslovak foreign minister, has been mandated to
undertake a mediation mission to the troubled enclave.
The mission, proposed by Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign
minister, will be prepared by a meeting of senior officials of the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in Prague today.
Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, yesterday warned that fighting
over Nagorno-Karabakh could lead to a full-scale war that might engulf
others, and said Armenia should drop any claims to the territory.
But Iran, another neighbour, is suspicious of Turkey's intentions. A Foreign
Ministry statement quoted by Tehran radio reiterated Iran's offer to mediate
but said that 'the trend of events indicates the involvement of foreign and
seditious elements in the clashes'. This was seen as a reference to Turkey,
which Iranian newspapers have criticised for suggesting US mediation.
The NACC ministers pleaded with the two feuding Caucasus republics to find a
peaceful solution to the conflict.
'We stressed the need for the parties to take concrete actions to step back
from the cycle of violence,' Mr James Baker, US secretary of state said.
Mr Baker warned that 'there will be no victors' if the violence continued.
'There is no glory in leaving widows and orphans to build the democratic,
free-market societies that should be the paramount priority.'
Later, the foreign ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia - at separate news
conferences - made accusations over who was to blame for the conflict in
Nagorno-Karabakh. Both ministers nevertheless said they wanted to solve the
conflict peacefully and that a ceasefire should be monitored by
international peacekeepers.
Mr Gusseinaga Sadykhov, Azerbaijan's foreign minister, welcomed the new CSCE
attempt to solve the crisis.
Mr Dienstbier will be going to Nagorno-Karabakh in his capacity as the
current CSCE president.
His mission is intended to support efforts already undertaken by Russia to
resolve the dispute. The immediate aim is to bring about a ceasefire, an
exchange of prisoners and to set up a corridor through which humanitarian
aid can be channelled.
The agreement by the Council was its first decision following the formal
admission yesterday of 10 new members from the CIS, including Armenia and
Azerbaijan. Russia, the Baltic states and the new central and eastern
European democracies have been members since last year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze is to head a new council
set up to run the republic of Georgia, Reuter reports from Moscow.
He was named in a decree issued by the military council that has ruled
Georgia since driving out President Zviad Gamsakhurdia two months ago.
Mr Shevardnadze was Georgia's Communist party chief for 13 years before
President Mikhail Gorbachev brought him to Moscow as foreign minister. He
returned to his native Georgia last week after seven years in Moscow.
Mr Shevardnadze has said he will probably stand for a seat in the Georgian
parliament later this year and has not ruled out standing for the
presidency.
Many Georgians regard him as the last hope of bringing peace to the country,
suffering from severe economic difficulties in the aftermath of civil
strife.
The new state council is to have executive and legislative power. The decree
named Mr Iosi Joseliani, one of the military commanders who led the
rebellion against President Gamsakhurdia, as Mr Shevardnadze's deputy.
Also included is Mr Tengiz Sigua, Georgia's virtual prime minister since Mr
Gamsakhurdia's overthrow.
Members of various minority groups, at odds with Tbilisi during Mr
Gamsakhurdia's tenure, were also included.
Georgia became isolated internationally under Mr Gamsakhurdia and remains
outside the Commonwealth of Independent States.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Poll battle to focus on taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUDGET designed to wrongfoot the Labour party put income tax at the centre
of the most closely fought election since the early 1970s as the opposition
pledged to reverse the tax cuts announced by Mr Norman Lamont.
After initial uncertainty in the aftermath of Mr Lamont's Commons statement,
Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, said Labour would oppose the 20p lower
rate band at the core of the package. His comments came as a survey taken
before the Budget confirmed that Labour would start the election campaign
with a small opinion poll lead.
Senior ministers voiced confidence that the package - a careful political
balancing act designed to steal Labour's most attractive clothes while
deflecting charges of bribery - would enable the Conservatives to regain the
political initiative.
'It is a simple choice . . . do the voters want a Pounds 140-a-year cut in
their tax bill or do they want Labour's high taxes,' one member of the
cabinet said. Mr Lamont sought to reinforce the message with a pledge that a
re-elected Conservative government would eventually cut the basic rate of
income tax to 20p.
Amid disquiet on the right of the Conservative party about a prospective
increase in public borrowing to Pounds 28bn next year, MPs were uncertain
whether the Budget would break the political stalemate of the last six
months.
Mrs Margaret Thatcher, former prime minister, refused to comment on the
Budget but her political allies said she was 'concerned' about the sharp
increase in borrowing.
As the chancellor deflected questions from political journalists at
Westminster about interest rate cuts, there were hopes among Conservative
MPs that the Budget would be quickly followed by a small cut in rates.
Mr Lamont announced an array of other measures - ranging from help for small
businesses and for the motor industry to increased help for low-income
pensioners - designed to win over key groups of voters.
The changes to the uniform business rate are aimed at boosting Conservative
support among small businessmen in southern marginals. The halving of car
tax should benefit the motor industry in the electoral battlegrounds of the
Midlands. Inheritance tax changes are designed to win votes from farmers and
small businessmen.
As Mr Neil Kinnock charged that tax cuts paid for by public borrowing
represented a 'panic-stricken, pre-election political sweetener', there was
private acknowledgment in the shadow cabinet that the Conservative challenge
over tax cuts for the lower paid had left Labour with awkward choices.
The opposition has long advocated the introduction of a reduced-rate tax
band. But if Labour accepts it now it will be unable to sustain its claim of
Conservative electoral bribery with borrowed money.
Mr Smith, who will announce early next week his alternative Budget, said his
priority was to pull the economy out of recession. Mr Kinnock sought to
reinforce the contrast between a long-term commitment to economic revival
and a short-term Conservative 'fix'.
Mr Lamont, however, said that the voters would be presented with a clear
choice between a government committed to cutting taxes, particularly for the
lower paid, while maintaining good public services, and an opposition
committed to pushing up everyone's tax bill.
The Conservatives, fractionally behind in the opinion polls, are relying on
the Budget to push them into the lead by the start of formal campaigning
early next week.
An ICM opinion poll for today's Guardian newspaper puts Labour at 42 per
cent against the Conservatives' 39 per cent and 15 per cent for the Liberal
Democrats.
The prime minister plans to ask the Queen later today to dissolve parliament
from next Monday. Senior ministers said they expected a formal announcement
today, though Downing Street cautioned that there was still a slight chance
it could be delayed until tomorrow.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Lamont steals Labour's thunder: Surprise package targets low
income voters - Major set to announce April 9 election today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TORIES' bid for a fourth term in office was launched yesterday by Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, with a Budget calculated to steal Labour's
thunder by cutting taxes for the lower-paid.
The measures, introducing a surprise 20 per cent lower band of income tax to
benefit low-income voters, are expected to pave the way for the announcement
today by Mr John Major, the prime minister, of April 9 as the general
election date.
Mr Lamont not only unveiled the lower band of income tax for the first
Pounds 2,000 of taxable income, he also pledged extra help for poorer
pensioners and extended assistance to small businesses and the car industry.
The chancellor said government borrowing would double in 1992-93 to Pounds
28bn, unsettling the City.
Speaking to a packed House of Commons, Mr Lamont set the tone of his tensely
awaited Budget package by adopting another Labour party policy in announcing
that Britain's unique and much-criticised two-part annual budget process
would be scrapped.
Mr Lamont said that from December 1993 the government's Autumn Statement
spending plans and the traditional springtime revenue-raising Budget would
be combined.
But he held back from widely tipped tax moves such as cutting the basic rate
of income tax by 1p from 25p in the pound or raising tax allowances by more
than the rate of inflation.
Mr Lamont limited the overall Budget 'giveaway' to just under Pounds 1.5bn
in 1992-93 by raising tobacco and leaded petrol taxes and vehicle excise
duty by more than the rate of inflation.
The Pounds 1.77bn cost of the new lower income tax band will also be
financed by freezing some tax allowances and drawing on Pounds 680m saved
from the postponement of the abolition of stamp duty on securities
transactions and other tax changes that have been announced since last
year's Budget.
Mr Lamont hailed his second Budget as one 'for the recovery' which built on
the supply side economic reforms of the 1980s. But its immediate impact was
to present an uncomfortable challenge to the Labour benches.
Although the government's income tax reductions concentrated at the lower
end of the earnings scale, Labour last night pledged to reverse the measures
if elected.
The tax cut for the coming 1992-93 financial year was lower than the Pounds
3bn to Pounds 4bn predicted by many commentators. But the chancellor
forecast higher public sector borrowing requirements (PSBR) than the City
had expected for both this financial year and the next.
He estimated the 1991-92 PSBR at Pounds 13.8bn, or 2 1/4 per cent of gross
domestic product, compared with City expectations of about Pounds 12bn, and
the Pounds 7.9bn deficit forecast in his first Budget. For 1992-93, Mr
Lamont forecast a PSBR of Pounds 28.1bn, or 4 1/2 per cent of GDP, against
City expectations of Pounds 25bn and government predictions in last
November's Autumn Statement of about Pounds 19bn. But he stuck to his
commitment of balancing the budget over the economic cycle.
The package provoked a mixed initial reaction on financial markets, with
equities moving higher. However, sterling and gilt-edged securities fell in
value on concern about the high borrowing requirement.
The market reaction suggested that there would be no early fall in interest
rates. But Mr Lamont later indicated to lobby correspondents that he did not
rule out an interest rate cut during the election campaign.
Although such action would be virtually unprecedented, he said it would be
'a matter for me and the Bank of England'.
In his Budget speech, the chancellor painted a picture in which economic
recovery had effectively been postponed for a year. He forecast 1 per cent
growth of GDP this year with growth quickening as the year progresses. The
Treasury now expects GDP to grow by nearly 2 per cent in the 12 months to
the second half of this year, and by 3 per cent in the year to June 1993.
Retail price inflation is expected to fall to 3 3/4 per cent at the end of
this year, and 3 1/4 per cent by mid-1993 from 4 1/4 per cent in the final
quarter of 1991.
However, the chancellor said he was confident that the lower inflation
combined with the interest rate cuts of the past year would help recovery.
The tax cuts would assist this trend.
The income tax changes will leave most taxpayers Pounds 2.64 better off a
week, but benefit the lower paid in particular. A married man or single
parent will have Pounds 138 more to spend a year, irrespective of whether he
or she earns Pounds 8,000 or Pounds 25,000 a year. The higher paid, with
taxable incomes of more than Pounds 23,700, will be Pounds 160 better off.
The government also announced extra help for pensioners on income support of
Pounds 2 a week for a single person, and Pounds 3 for couples, from October.
Mainly to help small businesses, Mr Lamont announced that the uniform
business rate on 900,000 commercial properties would be pegged in real terms
in 1992-93. This and other measures easing the UBR burden will cost Pounds
480m in the coming financial year and Pounds 590m in 1993-94.
The chancellor also announced technical changes to the levying of VAT to aid
businesses, and exempted most business assets from inheritance tax so that
family businesses could be passed on without charge.
Mr Lamont resisted lobbying from organisations such as the Confederation of
British Industry for an increase in investment allowances.
But Mr Lamont announced a series of far-reaching measures to aid the car
industry. He halved the special 10 per cent car tax to 5 per cent from
today, reducing the price of a typical family car by about Pounds 400. He
also proposed to:
Lift restrictions on businesses claiming capital allowances on cars costing
Pounds 12,000 or less.
Allow driving schools, taxi and car-hire firms to recover VAT when they buy
cars.
Consult on plans to move the taxation of company cars to a system based on a
car's price rather than its engine size.
In a move that may encourage a surge in investment the Budget proposes to
end the Business Expansion Scheme at the end of next year.
The odds about the Tories winning the election shortened after the Budget.
Ladbrokes, the bookmaker, is quoting 2-1 on for the Conservatives to win
most seats, compared with 7-4 on before the Budget. Labour's odds eased from
11-8 to 6-4. The Liberal Democrats remain 500-1.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Prospects fade for cut in rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, ROBERT PESTON and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for an early cut in the base lending rate receded as sterling gave
up early gains after Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, had made his Budget
speech.
A government official said: 'It would not be wise to hold out much hope of a
cut in the next few days'. Analysts said that the chances of a cut were
'50-50 at best'.
In New York, sterling traded close to the bottom of its range within the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.
Prices of gilt-edged stock - government bonds - also fell sharply after the
chancellor forecast a public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) of Pounds
28bn for 1992-93.
This higher PSBR means the government will have to sell more gilts in the
coming year than investors had been expecting.
The stock market held on to gains which had been achieved early in the
session and the FT-SE 100 Index closed 24.1 up at 2,574.8. Nevertheless,
after the market closed, traders said they were increasingly anxious.
A fall in the price of the March future contract on the FT-SE Index - which
gives an indication of investors' sentiment - appeared to be signalling that
share prices would open lower this morning.
Mr Michael Marks, chief executive of Smith New Court, the leading
marketmaker or wholesaler of shares, said that the one bright spot was
shares in motor traders. These were boosted by the government's measures to
help car sales.
Meanwhile, market strategists disagreed about the political impact of the
Budget which had been widely regarded as a curtain-raiser to the
Conservative government's campaign for re-election.
They said that sterling and share prices were only likely to strengthen
significantly if the Conservatives took a lead in the forthcoming election
campaign.
'This is not a Budget for voters,' said Mr Ian Harnett, analyst at the
securities house Strauss Turnbull. However, Mr Roger Palmer, of Kleinwort
Benson, said it would help the Conservatives to win the support of lower
paid individuals in marginal seats.
'I think the markets are taking too pessimistic a view of the Budget,' he
said.
Mr Nick Parsons, treasury adviser at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,
said: 'The Budget . . . merely prolongs the uncertainty in the market.'
He complained that the chancellor's commitment to taking sterling into the
narrow band - or trading range - within the ERM was 'vague'.

FT  11 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities firm after the Budget speech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUDGET speech from the UK chancellor of the exchequer confirmed a firmer
trend established in the stock market early in yesterday's session. After
showing some uncertainty at first, share prices moved higher after
mid-session as equities responded to a firmer trend in sterling and at the
4.30pm close, just before the chancellor finished speaking, the market was
24.1 points up 2,574.8, the best level of the day. However, equity market
confidence was dimmed in late trading when the stock index futures sector
lost ground.
The cyclical stocks, including building materials and stores, led the market
advance in early trading, as sterling's firmness renewed expectations that
base rates will be cut very soon. The Budget measures were seen as broadly
favourable for brewery and similar consumer stocks, with the motor industry
issues benefiting from the cuts in motor tax and car scale charges.
Trading volume appeared relatively good for a session in which the leading
institutions were unwilling to take decisive investment decisions. But the
Seaq-reported volume level of 431.7m shares took in a high proportion of
intra market business as marketmakers struggled to pass stock on to the next
dealer rather than allow share positions to rise.
While there was some nervousness over the estimated Pounds 28bn Public
Sector Borrowing Requirement for next year, the stock market brushed off,
for the time being, the downturn in the UK government bond sector. The
absence yesterday of any cut in base rates left traders concerned that it
might now be difficult to cut rates before the announcement of the UK
election. Announcement of the election date, widely predicted as April 9, is
expected before the end of the week.
On the wider implications of the budget strategy, the City of London
appeared satisfied that its forecasts on economic growth and measures on
personal taxation would enhance the chances of an election victory for the
governing Conservative party.
The market made a difficult start after a bomb explosion in London brought a
widespread security alert which delayed commuter travelling and caused two
leading securities firms to evacuate their premises, albeit briefly.
Share prices were easier in early trading, but rallied when the stock index
futures again opened firmly. Shares made good progress as traders continued
to show confidence ahead of the Budget speech, timed to take place in the
final hours of trading.
But it was sterling's improvement, mirrored by a softening in London money
rates, which turned the equity market higher. The Footsie was 22 points up
when the chancellor began to speak and, after some brief hesitation, edged
ahead again as he ended his speech.
But the more significant response may have come from the stock index
futures, where the March contract turned steadily downwards as Mr Lamont's
speech progressed. This, together with the similarly negative response from
sterling on the foreign exchange markets, may set the trend for this
morning's opening trades in equities. However, a brighter spot on the
market's horizon last night was the early gain on Wall Street which was 20
Dow points ahead in UK trading hours.

FT  11 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE higher-than-anticipated PSBR figure included in the chancellor's Budget
speech caused a retreat in stock index futures after an advance earlier in
the session, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened around the 2,577 level, the March contract on the FT-SE moved
forward, taking a firm overnight on Wall Street as its cue.
However, nervousness about the Budget statement caused March to relinquish
earlier gains and it retreated to 2,566.
The positive opening on Wall Street led to dealers moving to cover positions
which triggered a squeeze, sending the March contract forward to reach
2,592, the high point of the session.
The contract retreated on the PSBR news following falls in the sterling and
gilts markets.
March closed at 2,570, down 4 on the previous session and around its fair
value premium to cash of around 4.
Further falls in the March contract were recorded in after-hours trading and
dealers expect today's session to open lower.
In LTOM, volume improved to 22,232 lots, with the FT-SE accounting for 7,639
contracts of the day's total. Among stock options, Amstrad traded 2,525
lots, with the June 30 puts particularly busy.

FT  11 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHARMACEUTICALS group Wellcome declined on reports from Tokyo that a new
drug manufactured by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical could have applications in the
treatment of Aids, encroaching into Wellcome's lucrative market share.
Wellcome closed 9 lower at 1004p, having been sold down to 983p during early
exchanges. Turnover of 1.7m shares was slightly above average. The
relatively small fall was an indication that the development process was
still at a very early stage. Mr Didier Cowling at Nomura said: 'It may be a
significant development, but it is very long term. In addition there is a
good chance that it will eventually be a combination of drugs - most likely
including Wellcome's Retrovir - which will be used to treat HIV and Aids.'
Fujisawa jumped more than 5 per cent in Tokyo on Monday on the news that its
FK-506 drug, developed to suppress the immune system in transplant patients,
had been used in tests to stop the replication of human cells infected with
HIV, the Aids virus.
Car sales boost
The motors sector was cheered by the chancellor's halving of new car tax to
5 per cent. The market was looking for such a move and the Budget statement
lifted the motor distributors, although several had already moved ahead in
anticipation.
Among the main moves recorded were Thomas Cowie, up 8 at 148p, Lex Service,
ahead 10 at 244p, Pendragon, 8 higher at 196p, and Perry Group, 7 firmer at
159p. Mr Peter Deighton at Smith New Court said: 'The market was looking for
some help for the motor industry. This will do enough to help stimulate
demand for new cars without seriously impacting on residual values.'
Meanwhile, bid speculation lifted BSG by 1 1/2 to 66p.
Allied-Lyons rallies
Brewing shares gained ground on news that the chancellor intends to increase
excise duties only in line with inflation, putting just over a penny on a
typical pint of beer. Allied-Lyons closed just a penny down at 649p,
recovering from a day's low of 631p touched on the referral of a joint
venture to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Turnover came to 2.6m
shares.
The proposed venture between Allied-Lyons and the lager producer Carlsberg
would give the Anglo-Danish group 20 per cent of the UK beer market, putting
it in third place behind Bass with 23 per cent and Foster's, brewers of
Courage beers, with about 21 per cent.
According to the Department of Trade and Industry, the joint venture raises
competition issues in the UK beer market which deserve investigation. The
commission will make its recommendation by June 12.
Generators weak
A call by the House of Commons' Energy Select Committee for a monopolies
inquiry into the dominance of National Power and PowerGen in the UK
electricity industry caused a flurry of selling pressure in the two stocks,
which underperformed the rest of the utilities areas of the market.
Criticism of the two companies, coming hard on the heels of sell notes from
some of the market's most influential broking houses, including BZW, left
both stocks floundering against a fundamentally strong market.
National Power retreated 5 to 218p on relatively high turnover of 8.6m
shares, while PowerGen dipped 6 to 227p on 7.7m traded.
A sharp rise in Redland of 18 to 476p substantially increased the value of
its offer for Steetley to some 414p and helped to drive the latter up 15 to
402p. The market is now quietly confident that Redland will win the day with
its bid, which closes on March 26.
There was nothing in the Budget proposals for the oil sector, which tended
to lag behind the rest of the equity market. BP, still in the middle of a
tug-of-war between UK brokers, largely bears of the stock, and those in the
US, mainly bullish of the shares, began to creep higher, with dealers
suspecting that one of the leading UK integrated houses may be about to give
the shares a strong upward push. At the close BP were 4 firmer at 268 1/2 p.
The saga of speciality chemicals concern MTM continued yesterday as the
chief executive and finance director resigned after two profit warnings in
as many weeks and contradictory statements from the board over the state of
the company's finances.
The shares slipped 14 to 105p, making a total fall of 181.5p since February
28. Most analysts are on a hold, Mr Martin Evans at Hoare Govett commenting:
'At this price it is too late to sell, but equally too early to buy for
speculative recovery.'
Courtaulds regained further ground after its recent poor form, the shares
adding 11 at 544p. A shortage of stock in Laporte helped to lift the shares
14 to 613p.
Healthcare group Fisons continued its volatile run, sentiment being affected
by the weekend news that British scientists had made a significant
breakthrough in the fight against asthma. Fisons manufactures and markets
Intal, an anti-asthma drug, which had sales of Pounds 186m in 1991. The
shares fell 11 to 371p in exceptionally heavy trading of 7.3m, described by
one trader as 'very speculative'.
Medeva put on 4 to 286p as it revealed that it would be marketing a new oral
anti-typhoid medication in the UK, Eire and Spain.
The Budget was generally seen as favourable for brewers, distillers and the
cider industry, as duty rose in line with inflation and Mr Lamont said he
would not accept a deal that would allow members of the European Community
to levy no excise duty on wine they make but forces them to put up duties on
spirits which we make. Bass climbed 23 to 573p, Grand Metropolitan 25 to
933p, Guinness 17 to 625p and Whitbread 'A' 10 to 444p.
HP Bulmer firmed 3 to 273p after the chancellor added that he would not
allow Brussels to ride roughshod over the interests of the British cider
industry.
Cable and Wireless followed Monday's good performance with another strong
showing. Yesterday's rise was helped by a positive note issued by
Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott, the stockbroker, whose telecoms specialist, Mr
Marshall Whiting, described the shares as undervalued.
Mr Whiting said he expected a major contribution to come from UK mobile
phones, along with high growth from Mercury, C and W's telecoms subsidiary,
all underpinned by Hong Kong and China. 'A possible flotation of Mercury is
not in the price,' said the analyst. C and W shares climbed 7 to 619p on
good volume of 1.9m.
The maintained dividend at Glynwed International was welcomed by the market
in spite of a 64 per cent profits setback. The shares moved ahead 14 to
239p.
Several stocks in the engineering sector were targeted for their recovery
potential. Among those to benefit were APV, up 2 at 118p, IMI, 5 firmer at
254p, and FKI, where turnover reached 3.5m as the shares moved a penny
forward to 61p. Also lifted by the same sentiment was Smiths Industries,
which gained 13 to 299p.
Among transport stocks, P &amp; O continued to benefit from a UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew buy recommendation, rising 13 to 412p.
Stocks likely to star in a consumer-led recovery were favourites in the
leisure sector. Forte led a strong showing among hotel groups, moving up 3
1/2 to 230 1/2 p in busy turnover of 3.5m. Ladbroke Group, buoyed by the
Budget cut in betting tax, advanced 7 1/2 to 246 1/2 p, while Rank
Organisation jumped 24 to 718p in thin volume.
The absence of the much-rumoured rights issue from Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking, which announced preliminary figures yesterday, triggered a minor
flurry of selling in Midland Bank, which ended 4 off at 265p. There had been
suggestions on Monday that any cash call by Hongkong Bank would be used to
increase its 14.7 per cent stake in Midland.
Standard Chartered rose 4 to 463p in front of today's preliminary figures.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Appointments: Swapping foreign exchangers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lehman Brothers International must have pulled out all the remuneration
stops in pursuit of its 'commitment to a global business strategy'.
Its most recent catch for the London operation, after Dan Tyree who joins
from Salomon, is 43-year-old Chris Deuters, head of European foreign
exchange and derivatives at Citicorp. Appointed at managing director level,
he comes in as head of global foreign exchange, a new position.
Deuters leaves a bank which, despite its other problems, is one of the major
forces in global foreign exchange, something which investment bank Lehman,
hitherto, is clearly not. 'Money has a lot to do with the decision,' reckons
Ernst Brutsche who is in charge of Citicorp's European corporate business
and Deuters' boss.
Deuters (which does not rhyme with Reuters) came to Citi as a teller in 1970
and, apart from a two year spell with Deutsche in London, has been there
ever since.
While acknowledging the predominance of commercial rather than investment
banks in global fx, Lehman claims to be intent on achieving 'a leadership
position within foreign exchange worldwide'.
Citi is replacing him with Julian Simmonds, who was previously head of the
UK fx business, the bank's largest and most profitable fx operation
worldwide. While he will assume control of money markets as well as European
fx, Brutsche will oversee the derivatives business 'for the time being'.
Simmonds is 40 and joined Citi two years after Deuters with a degree in
Russian and maths.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Appointments: BA man to captain QEII
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Marcus Buck, until recently British Airways manager for Japan and Korea, is
to become chief executive of the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in
London from April 1.
The QEII Centre is a government-owned executive agency built to provide
secure conference facilities for national and international government
meetings. It hosted the 1990 conference of world leaders on the ozone layer
and this year it will be the London base for the UK presidency of the EC.
The largest purpose-built conference centre in London, the QEII centre also
markets its facilities to the private sector. It hosts more of the top 100
company agms than any other London venue and provides a London home for
BBC-TV's Question Time. It has been voted best UK conference centre for the
past five years.
For Buck, 53, it will be his first appointment outside BA and a return to
the UK after many years of managing the airline's operations in south-east
Asia, Australia and Latin America. He sees many similarities between
managing airline operations and a conference centre: 'Both involve elements
of travel and accommodation away from home; both must be run as profit
centres,' he says.
And he plans to improve on its reputation and profitability still further.

FT  11 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Latin American fortunes shift to Chile
 -William Cochrane reviews last month's performance of the world's emerging
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shifting fortunes in Latin America, a further slide in Turkey and equity
fever in India were key features in the world's emerging markets in
February. Currency movements were a parallel consideration.
In Latin America, Chile seems to have come back to life, with a local
currency gain of 15.1 per cent, rising to 17.3 per cent in dollar terms.
Santiago was put in the shade by some of its Latin American counterparts
last year, but it still registered a gain of 90 per cent in dollar terms
against the region's 125 per cent average advance.
After a rise of 124 per cent in dollar terms to its peak on October 6, Chile
fell away on profit-taking, and then in January, says Mr Michael Raynal of
BZW, institutional investors sat on their hands, and their profits. A
revaluation of the peso in January encouraged them to return to equities.
In February, institutional investors, mainly pension funds, came back in
force: daily turnover in Santiago rose from between USDollars 5m and Dollars
6m at the beginning of the month to between Dollars 9m and Dollars 13m at
the end. The combination of a strong currency and a booming domestic economy
has given it attractions which are unusual in global, as well as South
American, terms.
Brazil's climb was stalled by the drop in the cruzeiro, according to indices
published by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World
Bank. In contrast, Chile's local currency advance appreciated in dollar
terms.
After gains in dollar terms of 44.9 per cent in December and 37.6 per cent
in January, Brazil's equity market declined by 0.5 per cent last month, says
the IFC, although it registered a 23 per cent rise in local currency terms.
Turkey turned in the worst performance among emerging markets last year, say
Kleiman International Consultants of New York. After a slight rise in
January it was on its way down again last month, falling 30 per cent in
dollar terms.
Investors, says Kleiman, are waiting for long-promised structural reforms:
'. . . settlement problems and insider trading are still rampant, and
non-bank brokerages are not subject to capital adequacy requirements and
sufficient disclosure. Analysts estimate that the top 10 houses account for
70 per cent of trading activity, raising concern over potential disaster
should the market decline dramatically, putting broker solvency to the
test.'
A review of the Indian stock market will appear on this page later this
week.

FT  11 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage-related buying
gives Nikkei late boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARBITRAGE-related buying helped to push the Nikkei average into positive
territory late yesterday, after drifting lower earlier due to a lack of
fresh news, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index finished 56.91 ahead at the day's best of 20,854.59
after moving to the day's low of 20,627.02 in the morning session. Volume
increased slightly to 200m shares from 180m on arbitrage-related trading.
In spite of the rise in the Nikkei, other statistics reflected the overall
weakness of the market as declines led advances by 618 to 287 at the close,
with 203 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
slipped 7.64 to 1,494.79, falling below the 1,500 support level for the
first time since November 1986. In London trading, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
eased 3.42 to 1,136.58.
Fears that arbitrageurs will unwind cash positions held against the March
Nikkei index futures, which expire tomorrow, have been alleviated by a
steady roll-over into the June contract. Traders said the weakness in the
Topix index stemmed from worries that investors were not rolling over
positions on the Topix futures.
In addition, light selling by investment trusts and corporations depressed
prices of large-capital issues and blue chips. A total of 224 stocks hit new
lows since January last year.
Traders said some investors are worried that a discount rate cut may not
materialise this month. Bank of Japan governor Mr Yasushi Mieno re-turns
from Europe today. Miss Caroline Stone at Barclays de Zoete Wedd said: 'Many
people feel that a half-point cut has already been discounted by share
prices, and they now expect a 75 basis points cut to help boost activity.'
Drug-related stocks were actively traded by short-term investors. Okamoto,
the day's most active issue, rose Y90 to Y1,330 and Mochida Pharmaceutical
surged Y500 to Y4,430.
High-technology issues continued to lose ground on selling by corporations.
Hitachi receded Y15 to Y760 and Sony Y50 to Y3,900.
Power suppliers, sensitive to interest rate movements, were sold on the
weakness of the yen against the dollar, with Tokyo Electric Power falling
Y40 to Y2,880. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone weakened Y4,000 to a new
all-time low of Y674,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 70.58 to 22,248.60 in turnover of 147m
shares. Heavy cross-trading ahead of the March year-end book closing lifted
volume. Tokkin, or specified money trusts, and companies were seen
liquidating holdings.
Roundup
THE PACIFIC Rim was mostly higher yesterday. Seoul was closed for a holiday.
HONG KONG rose sharply in light trading as bargain hunters returned to the
market after Monday's sell-off. The Hang Seng index gained 70.32 at 4,918.95
but turnover dipped to HKDollars 1.69bn from HKDollars 1.83bn.
HSBC Holdings recovered HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 42.50 as rumours of a
rights issue faded. It published 1991 results after the close.
Banks turned in the day's steepest gains, followed by property counters.
NEW ZEALAND rebounded after five days of declines. Carter Holt Harvey picked
up 4 cents to NZDollars 2.26, after Monday's 18-cent fall on news of a big
rights issue. The NZSE-40 index rose 15.35 to 1,461.24.
AUSTRALIA gained ground in lacklustre trading, as selected buying of certain
stocks helped to push up the market. A firmer futures market also gave
support. The All Ordinaries index put on 7.2 to 1,605.4 in turnover of
ADollars 148.6m.
Among leading stocks, News Corp jumped 26 cents to ADollars 17.70, BHP added
18 cents at ADollars 13.44 and CRA rose 8 cents to ADollars 13.92.
TAIWAN was little changed in thin trading as investors stayed on the
sidelines due to a dispute within the ruling Kuomintang party over the
election for the presidency.
The weighted index edged forward 3.17 to 4,926.20 in turnover of TDollars
17.2bn.
SINGAPORE chalked up modest gains in dull trading. Some buying of bank
shares came in the wake of better than expected 1991 earnings from DBS Bank.
The Straits Times Industrial index firmed 3.02 to 1,432.67.
KUALA LUMPUR ended modestly higher after light bargain hunting, but
investors were remaining cautious until the year-end company reporting
season is over. The KLSE composite index added 2.94 at 586.95.
MANILA climbed in a technical correction, but political uncertainty ahead of
the May 11 polls kept volume low. The composite index improved 10.33 to
1,116.71 in combined turnover of 51.1m pesos, against a previous 90.8m.
BANGKOK finished unchanged as losses in large-capital issues offset gains in
other sectors. The SET index was just 0.28 up at 797.90 in turnover of
Bt3.22bn, the smallest in two months.
Bangkok Land lost Bt4 to Bt208 and Bangkok Bank also shed Bt4, to Bt684.
BOMBAY retreated from Monday's record high after state-owned investment
houses sold heavily to cool what they saw as an overheated market. The BSE
index fell to 3,261.00 before closing at 3,316.03, down a net 231.58.

FT  11 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt takes dividend cuts
in its stride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANKFURT took dividend cuts by two big chemical companies in its stride
while the upswing in Paris gathered momentum, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS approached 2,000 as its current favourites continued to rise. The
CAC-40 index rose 17.60 to 1,993.38 in turnover of FFr2.23bn but dealers
expected the final figure to be swelled by orders booked after the close.
Euro Disney closed at an all-time high of FFr164.30, up FFr2.80, as
overnight orders from the US were executed.
Elf fell another FFr3 to FFr366.90 as the government placed its 2.3 per cent
stake, but news that the international tranche was already oversubscribed by
yesterday morning indicated that the stock would rebound soon.
Chargeurs, popular last week on reports that BSkyB would soon be in profit,
rose FFr54 or 4.6 per cent to FFr1,218 on confirmation that the satellite
television company was breaking even early in March. There were reports that
analysts were raising their estimates of Chargeurs' net asset value.
One of the day's biggest losers was Printemps which fell FFr45 or 5.1 per
cent to FFr835 after a French court rejected a demand by its minority
shareholders that Pinault should extend its two-thirds bid for the
department store group to 100 per cent.
FRANKFURT continued its consolidation, unmoved by dividend cuts from BASF
and Hoechst. In fact, shares in the two chemicals companies rose by DM1.90
and 50 pfg respectively, to DM249.50 and DM256.20.
The FAZ index rose 0.97 to 711.52 at midsession, and the DAX index put on
0.29 to 1,750.54 at the close. Volume rose from DM5bn to DM5.9bn.
Ms Wendy Anderson at County NatWest said that BASF was heavily exposed to
areas of overcapacity in the industry, and that its results indicated a
final quarter fall in profits from DM410m to DM150m. Final quarter profits
at Hoechst, with a better product profile, were likely to have fallen from
DM764m to DM540m.
The shipbuilder and engineer Bremer Vulkan rose DM2 to DM83.30 on nearly
doubled 1191 net profits, and news that it would be buying two of the
largest shipyards in east Germany.
MILAN steadied after its recent fall on short-covering ahead of Thursday's
expiry of monthly options. The Comit index lost just 0.03 to 512.73 but
turnover remained thin, estimated at L70bn after L60.5bn.
Shares in Bonifiche Siele, the holding company of Banca Nazionale
dell'Agricoltura (BNA), Italy's second largest private sector bank,
plummeted L5,100 or 15 per cent to L29,000 in thin trading. The stock was
re-admitted on Monday after an investigation by Consob.
Generali advanced L95 to L29,650 before it posted a 15.1 per cent increase
in parent company premium income for 1991. Eridania rose L80 to L6,780 after
pleasing the market with a 15 per cent rise in 1991 operating profits.
ZURICH rose, with foreign investors balancing a local preference for
high-yielding, money market instruments. The all-share SPI index rose 2.7 to
1,135.5.
Surveillance, the product and resource inspection group, fell SFr160 to
SFr7,890. Late on Monday it followed the latest fashion with five-for-one
share split, but the market was disappointed with a rise of just 3 per cent
in 1991 net profits.
AMSTERDAM continued to focus on the brewing sector while the rest of the
market was mixed to lower. The CBS Tendency Index eased 0.1 to 127.8 in
light turnover of Fl 456.6m.
Heineken and Grolsch rose to to new all-time highs. Grolsch, which reports
its 1991 results today, gained Fl 5.50 to Fl 204.00 while Heineken, which
reported last week, gained Fl 1.70 to Fl 179.00.
BRUSSELS closed mostly higher although Solvay moved against the trend. The
Bel-20 Index rose 7.50 to 1,209.34, Solvay easing BFr100 to BFr12,300 in
volume of 3,875 shares, while SGB gained another BFr10 to BFr2,215.
STOCKHOLM scored its tenth consecutive gain, although the Affarsvarlden
General index closed just 2.2 higher at 991.5, lifted by hopes of improved
company profits in 1993 and the gradual scrapping of restricted shares which
foreigners may not own.
However Sandvik, the steel tools group, saw its B shares SKr1 lower at
SKr395, on a drop in 1991 net profits from SKr2.69bn to SKr1.92bn, and in
spite of its own decision to remove share ownership restrictions.
HELSINKI staged a rebound after falling for the previous 11 trading days,
and dealers expected a continued uptrend in anticipation of Finland's entry
into the EC. The Hex index rose 7.8 to 866.9.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UN plans commodity data service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH PRICE stabilisation accords for commodities off the international
agenda, their chief sponsor, the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (Unctad), is seeking to harness rather than buck the market to
help commodity exporting developing countries.
Unctad officials are developing a computerised commodity information system
that they believe could transform marketing, investment and diversification
decisions by governments and private companies. Micas (micro-computer based
commodity information and analysis system), now in a pilot phase, should
eventually be capable of providing comprehensive, up-to-date information on
all aspects of commodity use, production, trade and consumption at all
levels from the world to the production unit.
Unctad's main aim is to help poor countries take sensible decisions on
developing and managing their commodity economies with the aid of systematic
and timely information.
This, officials argue, will enable them to compete more effectively on world
markets. The system can be used for policy analysis within government or in
the management of individual production units.
For instance, a policy-maker in the Philippines looking at the options for
further processing of coconuts could, at the touch of a computer key,
display the most recent figures on worldwide trade in coconuts and coconut
products, trends in production, consumption and trade, production of and
markets for coconut products by country and the names, production facilities
and capacity utilisation of every company involved in coconut products.
Demonstrations of Micas in 15 Asian countries, including India, China and
Japan, have shown the potential usefulness of the system, says Mr Jay
Colebrook, who is in charge of the project. The database includes existing
Unctad trade information and can tap the computerised agricultural
statistics of the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation. Micas will
also contain information on upwards of 50,000 companies around the world.
If all goes well, Unctad plans to supply the software to developing country
users free of charge on condition that they undertake to feed the system
with the necessary (non-confidential) information. The UN agency aims to
meet the running costs by selling information to private companies.
Mr Colebrook hopes next year to begin installing a pilot version of Micas,
which has been developed with financial aid from the Italian government, in
at least a dozen Third World countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Trade plan sows wrath of
Chilean grape growers / A move to allow Argentine competitors to ship
through the country's ports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCISCO ECHEVERRIA lost his faith in modernity around 1850, when the
latest mining equipment he had imported from Britain caught the trailing
garments of his Parisian bride and ripped her to shreds. Echeverria never
returned to his foundry in the valley of Copiapo, an oasis in the Atacama
desert that was the centre of Chile's feverish mining boom 150 years ago.
He would not recognise his barren valley today. Thousands of acres have been
reclaimed from the desert, which is now carpeted with row upon row of
delicate grape vines. Under the harsh midday sun, the grey, almost
colourless mountains that rise on either side of the valley are in stark
contrast to the deep green trellises below.
Chile has an exceptionally long grape harvesting season. It starts at
Copiapo in November and follows the sun to end south of Santiago in March or
April. A 20,000-strong labour force also follow the sun. The largely female
workers leave their families at the start of the summer and put up in rough
accommodation offered by large estates and packing plants, swelling small
towns like Copiapo at weekends.
Desert reclamation, which began 10 years ago, is an expensive business.
Because the Copiapo river is little more than a brackish trickle, deep wells
must be dug to tap the valley's water table. The grape vines are watered by
drip irrigation, which rations the most precious commodity in the desert.
Initial outlays are high - requiring a typical investment of Dollars 5,000
an acre - and yields are much lower than in the orchards around Santiago.
But handsome profits are earned from Copiapo's early produce at a time when
fresh grapes are not available anywhere else in the world. The first fruits
of the valley can fetch up to Dollars 40 per 8.2 kg box when they arrive at
the port of Philadelphia in November. By March prices have fallen to about
Dollars 11 a box.
A shiver of fear swept through the Copiapo valley earlier this month when
the government announced plans to allow Argentine fruit exporters a Pacific
outlet through the port of Caldera. The opening of Chilean ports to
Argentine trade next year forms part of an economic integration accord
signed in 1990. Instead of trundling through hundreds of kilometres of
pampas to reach Buenos Aires, fruit exports from northern Argentina will
only have to make the relatively brief trip across the Andes before setting
sail.
Fear rapidly turned to indignation. Chilean producers do not want
competition from Argentina, which harvests in the same months. But over and
above this, they are terrified that the transit of fresh Argentine produce
through the valley of Copiapo might bring pests such as the Mediterranean
fruit fly.
Up to now, the desert, the Andes and the Pacific Ocean have formed natural
barriers against infestation. The Chilean Ministry of Agriculture promises
to apply quarantines and strict sanitary controls at border crossings, but
fruit growers have not been pacified. 'Any lorry driver could bring the
Medfly in an apple in his packed lunch,' says Mr Guillermo Irrarazabal, who
works for David del Curto, Chile's biggest fruit exporter.
For Chile's fruit business, which earned close to Dollars 1bn last year, the
double-edged sword of competition and infestation conjures visions of
Argentine orchards riddled with uncontrollable plagues all storming the
Andes. Mr Ricardo Ariztia, president of Fedefruta, the fruit producers
federation, says he cannot understand why the government is willing to put
Chile's fruit exports at risk. 'We are strongly urging the authorities to
reconsider this decision,' he says.
Foreign markets, particularly in Japan and the US, are hard to win and
easily lost. 'An outbreak of Medfly could wipe out years of marketing
efforts,' says Mr Mauricio Meyer, a quality control expert.
As an example, Mr Meyer recalls that the Chilean Exporters' Association had
to build a Dollars 1m experimental station in the middle of the Atacama
desert to prove to Japanese trade officials that the Mediterranean fruit fly
could not cross the desert and was killed by 10 days in cold storage. 'This
despite 20 years of published research already proving the point,' he
concludes, a note of exasperation creeping into his voice.
Japan has just put Chile through a tough five-year test period to monitor
the quality of its fruit. The US recession, which has depressed demand for
Chile's produce, has put exporters in a fighting mood. They are working hard
to open new markets in Asia's Pacific Rim countries. The last thing they
want is Argentine rivals muscling in on their territory.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil to launch Dollars 1.5bn
farm credit package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT Fernando Collor is expected to launch a new Dollars
1.5bn agricultural package tomorrow to provide credit for marketing the near
record harvest expected.
After its disastrous performance of 1990 Brazil's farm sector has seen an
impressive turnround since government credits were finally released last
October, just in time for planting. According to Mr Antonio Cabrera, the
agriculture minister, this year's harvest will amount to 69.6m tonnes - the
second highest total ever.
The recent release of credits marks a radical reversal in thegovernment's
policy. The strategy adopted by Ms Zelia Cardoso, the former economy
minister, of scrapping subsidies and using imports to force down prices in
the 1990-91 season, resulted in a 7m-tonne shortfall in food products and a
foreign exchange loss through lost export earnings and increased imports
that Banco do Brasil estimates at about Dollars 3.5bn. Moreover, the rise in
wholesale food prices has been a major source of inflation, increasing 513
per cent compared with yearly inflation of 470 per cent.
By contrast Ms Cardoso's successor, Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, who took
office last May, sees the recovery of the farm sector and a bumper harvest
as crucial weapons in the fight to reduce the inflation rate and restimulate
the economy in Brazil's interior.
This year's increased output is mainly due to higher yields rather than
increased acreage. The amount of land under cultivation has increased by
only 2.6 per cent while the harvest is expected to be more than 20 per cent
up. The director of a major food processing company explained 'although
Zelia's policy was absurd and had no basis in reality it did have one
positive result - the weeding out of inefficient farmers'.
Tomorrow's 30-measure package will include the allocation of Cr300bn (Pounds
100m)in loans for marketing purposes, at real interest rates of 9 per cent a
year for small- and medium-scale producers and 12 per cent for large
producers. A further Cr650bn will be released to help finance the planting
of the winter crops, particularly of wheat. The government is hoping to
raise this year's wheat production to 4m tonnes from last year's 3m tonnes.
Domestic consumption is about 7m tonnes.
The remaining money will be for financing the purchase of farm machinery and
soil nutrients.
Mr Collor will also announce the creation of rural funds to attract foreign
investment, hoping to capitalise on Dollars 1bn in foreign money which has
entered the Brazilian bourse since it was opened up to foreigners last July.
Analysts say, however, that they doubt the ability of the Brazilian
agricultural sector to attract foreign investment.
The package follows Dollars 100m in credit released last month to cocoa
growers in the north-east to refinance debts, help combat witches broom
disease and to diversify production, and Cr1,000bn made available in October
in low interest credits, reduced from 18 to 9 per cent, and reduced tariffs
for pesticides.
Mr Cabrera now says that, apart from wheat, it will not be necessary to
import basic foodstuffs in 1992. In a recent interview he defended the
government's reversal in policy arguing, 'subsidies should be given for
harvesting in as much as they guarantee domestic supply. The classic error
of Brazilian agriculture in the past was to subsidise the intention to
produce'.

Gold was again testing the key Dollars 348 support level on the London
bullion market and Comex yesterday. 'The market seems to be in a stand-off
right now,' a New York analyst said at midday. 'The charts are weak, but
until support at Dollars 348 can be broken, gold will not drop sharply.'
Lack of investor interest continues to plague the market. Speculators still
consider stocks and bonds better investments and fears of inflation have
disappeared. On the LME three-month aluminium closed slightly ahead, but the
market lacked the momentum to move back over Dollars 1,300 a tonne. Dealers
said today's relatively small 2,200-tonne rise in LME stocks was
constructive. January producer data, with total IPAI inventories up 40,000
tonnes, did not affect the market as the inclusion of Iranian data for the
first time negated month-on-month comparisons. New York arabica coffee
futures were firm at midday after recouping earlier losses. The market was
awaiting a meeting of Brazilian coffee exporters who were due yesterday
afternoon to discuss a possible return to an international pact with export
quotas. In Chicago wheat futures plunged more than 7 cents shortly after
midday on reports of unrest in the CIS.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Low aluminium prices forecast
to halt capacity expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM SMELTER expansion plans are about to come to a halt, suggests the
New York-based Spector Report in its latest survey of primary aluminium
capacity.
'After 1994 almost all the planned capacity additions fall into the
uncertain category,' it says.
'The industry cannot justify building new capacity until aluminium ingot
prices rise to 75 cents a lb (Dollars 1,653 a tonne) and remain at that
level for a sustained period of time. With prices under 75 cents a lb, cash
flow generation would be insufficient to cover debt service, especially in
the early years of a project.
Last night the cash aluminium price closed at 57.6 cents a lb on the London
Metal Exchange.
The report suggests that at present prices it is 'next to impossible' to
finance a new smelter project - including those government-sponsored
projects in less developed countries where political risks are high.
It points out that this year four smelters will start up, adding 1.1m tonnes
to the industry's installed capacity base. In 1993 two projects will add
another 167,000 tonnes. Two small additions will add 75,000 tonnes in 1994.
In 1991 the industry outside the former eastern bloc countries added 3 per
cent to capacity to take it to 15.6m tonnes, according to Spector. This year
capacity will increase by 2.8 per cent to 16.1m tonnes. In 1993 capacity
increases by another 2.3 per cent to 16.4m tonnes and in 1994 by 0.8 per
cent.
The report points out: 'Projects now in the very early planning phase due
for completion in 1995 could add 4.6 per cent to industry capacity. This
could be followed by capacity increases of 4.3 per cent and 6.2 per cent in
1996 and 1997 respectively. However, until ingot prices rise, most new
projects planned for 1995 and after are graded as uncertain'.
It suggests that, if ingot prices do not rise to at least 75 cents a lb by
1993, capacity, especially in Europe, may have to be closed.

EURO MPs' amendments to the proposed reform of the European Community's
Common Agricultural Policy risk undermining the aims of the plan, Mr Ray
MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner, warned last night.
The European Parliament will vote on the amendments today and is expected to
come down broadly in favour of the European Commission's proposals.
But Mr MacSharry warned MEPs during yesterday's debate that Brussels 'could
not accept amendments whose effect would be to profoundly change our
approach, or to add significantly to the budgetary costs'.
Mr MacSharry singled out the cereals sector, which is at the core of the
commission's proposals. The parliament's agriculture committee wants to
maintain higher prices than those proposed by Brussels and to spread price
reductions over a longer period.
Mr MacSharry said he had 'the gravest doubts whether the objective of
attaining a stabilised world price level could be achieved at more than
Ecu100 (Pounds 71 a tonne)', which would be one effect of the MEPs'
amendments.
'This price is essential to keep community cereals competitive, and with the
substantial compensation being made available to producers, there are no
solid grounds for fixing a price that would stop short of our objective or
for delaying the timetable for reaching that price,' he added.
EC agriculture ministers met last week to discuss the reform package, but
the meeting broke up inconclusively after a number of member states
unearthed old objections to the principles of the reform.

FT  11 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: French property question is referred to
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEBB v WEBB
Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Nourse, Lord Justice Taylor and Lord Justice
Scott): February 27 1992
THE EUROPEAN Court of Justice is to be asked to make a preliminary ruling as
to whether the effect of the 1968 Brussels Convention is that French courts
have exclusive jurisdiction to hear a case concerning French property bought
by an English father in his son's name, for the alleged purpose of a trust
in the father's favour.
If on the true construction of article 16 of the Convention the object of
the claim is to establish rights of ownership in land, French courts have
exclusive jurisdiction. If the object is to enforce personal rights arising
from arrangements between father and son analogous to contract, the English
court has jurisdiction.
The Court of Appeal adjourned an appeal by the defendant son, Mr Lawrence
Desmond Webb, from a decision of Judge Paul Baker QC sitting as a High Court
judge, dismissing his application for summary dismissal of an action brought
against him by his father, Mr George Lawrence Webb.
LORD JUSTICE SCOTT said that an agreement to purchase a property in Antibes,
France, was concluded between the vendor and Mr George Webb, the father, in
July and August 1971.
In October 1971 the purchase was completed and the property was transferred
into the name of Mr Lawrence Webb, the son.
The purchase price of FFr600,000 was provided by the father and was placed
pending completion in an account in the son's name at the Antibes branch of
Barclays Bank.
Payment to the vendor was made out of the funds in that account.
The necessary exchange control permissions from the Bank of England were
obtained on the footing that the property would be purchased in the name of
the son.
After the purchase the property was used by the father and his wife, as well
as by the son, as a holiday home.
The bulk of the outgoings since purchase had been borne by the father.
The father contended that it was agreed between him and his son that the son
would hold the property in trust for him. He contended that he was entitled
to the use and enjoyment of the property to the exclusion of the son, and to
require the son to transfer the property into his name.
The son contended that the property and its contents were a gift to him from
the father.
The 1968 Brussels Convention was incorporated into domestic law by section 2
of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982.
Section 3(1) of the Act provided that any question as to the meaning or
effect of the Convention should, 'if not referred to the European Court in
accordance with the 1972 Protocol', be determined in accordance with
European Court decisions.
Section 3(2) provided that the report by Professor Schlosser on the
Accession Convention might be considered in ascertaining the meaning or
effect of any provision of the Conventions.
Article 16 of the Brussels Convention (section 5 Title II) provided that
'(1) in proceedings which have as their object rights in rem in . . .
immovable property, the courts of the contracting state in which the
property is situated' should have exclusive jurisdiction.
The issue was whether the action constituted 'proceedings which have as the
object rights in rem in immovable property'. If it did, then the courts of
France, being the contracting state in which the property was situated, had
exclusive jurisdiction and the English action should be dismissed.
The judge concluded that the action was not caught by article 16(1). The son
appealed.
The case for allowing the appeal was that the father was bringing the action
in order to establish his rights of ownership of the property. The property
was 'immovable property'. Rights of ownership were rights in rem. So the
action was covered by article 16(1).
The case for dismissing the appeal was that the father and son both
intended, when the property was purchased in 1971, that it would be put in
the son's name. The rights asserted by the father in the action derived from
the arrangements between father and son when the property was purchased.
Those rights were in personam rights, not in rem rights. They had nothing to
do with French land law. They were analogous to rights deriving from
contracts for the sale of land. Actions for enforcement for sale of land
were not, according to the Schlosser report, caught by article 16(1) (see
paragraphs 171 and 172 of the Report).
There were two European court decisions in which dicta bore on the issue
(see Rosler v Rottwinkel (1985) 1 CMLR 806 and Reichart v Dresdner Bank,
January 10 1990, Case C, 11/88). Those dicta were not, however, conclusive
of the issue.
The 1971 Protocol also was incorporated into domestic law by the 1982 Act,
and was set out in Schedule 2 to the Act.
Under article 3(2) of the Protocol the present court was empowered to
request the European Court of Justice to give a preliminary ruling on a
question of interpretation of the Brussels Convention 'if it considers that
a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment'.
A preliminary ruling should be sought from the European Court before
judgment was given on the present appeal. If it had been necessary to give
final judgment now, his Lordship would have dismissed the appeal on the
ground that the 'object' of the action was the enforcement of rights in
personam arising out of the arrangements between father and son, not rights
in rem, and that accordingly the action was not caught by article 16(1).
But the matter was not clear, particularly as Lord Justice Nourse was in
disagreement. Moreover, if the English court wrongly retained the action,
the French courts might decline to enforce any orders made (see article 28).
The proper scope of article 16(1) might depend on identification of the
policy underlying the article. The European Court was the appropriate forum
to identify the correct purposive interpretation of article 16(1) in its
application to the facts of the case.
Therefore, the court should request the European Court to give a preliminary
ruling on the question whether, on the true interpretation of article 16(1),
the present proceedings were proceedings in respect of which the courts of
France had exclusive jurisdiction.
Pending the preliminary ruling, the appeal was adjourned.
LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR agreed.
LORD JUSTICE NOURSE said that the 'object' of the action, by which was meant
the subject matter, was a right in rem in immovable property within article
16(1) of the Brussels Convention.
He would have allowed the appeal and dismissed the action.
But the division in opinion meant that a decision of the European Court on
the question was necessary to enable the court to give judgment.
He therefore agreed that a preliminary ruling of the European Court should
be requested under article 3(2) of the 1971 Protocol.
For the son: Mark Blackett-Ord and Barbara Rich (William Sturges &amp; Co).
For the father: Michael Briggs (Bower Cotton &amp; Bower).

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN STANLEY, the US investment bank, has promoted Mr John Mack, head of
its fixed income division, to lead a new committee which will take on
responsibility for day-to-day running of the group.
The appointment is part of a management reorganisation which also includes
the unusual move of running the group's worldwide government securities
business - including US Treasuries - to London. Morgan Stanley says the
reorganisation is designed to allow it to make decisions more quickly and
strengthen its international businesses.
The new operating committee will remove much of the burden of routine
day-to-day decision-making from Mr Richard Fisher, Morgan Stanley chairman,
and Mr Robert Greenhill, its president. They, and other inside members of
the group's board, will retain responsibility for strategy and policy.
Mr Mack, 47, will thus become roughly the equivalent of chief operating
officer. Other members of the operating committee will be the heads of
Morgan Stanley's largest divisions - equity, fixed income, investment
banking, asset management and finance, administration and operations - and
the heads of the London and Tokyo offices.
Mr Mack will be succeeded as head of fixed income by Mr Peter Karches, aged
40.
The firm is also relocating four managing directors from New York to London
and Tokyo, and as part of this change is moving global responsibility for
some businesses from New York to London. Its ability to do so reflects the
increasingly global nature of capital mar-kets.
The head of European operations, Mr Timothy Hultquist, is returning to New
York where he will continue to head the group's foreign exchange business,
and will take on responsibility for commodities.

<TEXT>
NORMANDY Poseidon, Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Australian resources
group, yesterday announced a 12.5 per cent increase in net profits to
ADollars 14.4m (USDollars 10.8m) for the six months to the end of December.
However, the group said the result was not comparable with the earlier
period because of the merger of Normandy Resources and Poseidon in May as
part of an attempt by Mr de Crespigny to improve the group's image.
In addition, the results of three subsidiaries - Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie,
Mt Leyshon Gold Mines and Command Petroleum Holdings - have been
consolidated for the first time.
Mr de Crespigny said the group's operating profit of ADollars 59m on sales
revenue of ADollars 293m was 'a very pleasing result in the light of weak
commodity prices'.
Poseidon Gold (Posgold), the group's 76 per cent-owned gold mining arm,
reported a consolidated profit of ADollars 53.6m, an increase of 22 per cent
over the earlier period.
However, Posgold incurred a tax charge of ADollars 20.5m, following the
removal by the federal government of a tax exemption for gold mining.
Posgold announced during the period that it plans to merge with Mt Leyshon
Gold Mines and ACM Gold, formerly part of Australian Consolidated Minerals,
which is controlled jointly by Normandy Poseidon and Western Mining
Corporation.
Mr de Crespigny said the merger would result in the creation of a gold
company with 'strong fundamentals and improved marketability of shares'
which should make it attractive to investors.
Shareholders will vote on the proposed merger later this month.
In a separate announcement, ACM Gold said net profits fell to ADollars 3.6m
for the six months to December, compared with ADollars 12.8m in the previous
first half. Revenue was down from ADollars 119m to ADollars 102m.
The company said the result was struck after abnormal charges of ADollars
14.9m relating to the write back of future tax benefits which are no longer
certain of recovery, and provisions against the carrying value of some
assets and investments.

<TEXT>
FOSTER'S Brewing, Australia's largest brewer, yesterday said its recovery
strategy would be unaffected by the resignation of Mr Peter Bartels, chief
executive, following a boardroom row.
Mr Nobby Clark, chairman, said Mr Bartels would be replaced by Mr Ted
Kunkel, chairman of Molson Breweries, the Canadian brewer jointly owned by
Foster's and the Molson Companies.
Mr Kunkel, a New Zealander, is a former Foster's executive who headed the
group's Carlton and United Breweries subsidiary in Melbourne before being
posted to Toronto in 1987 to head Foster's Carling O'Keefe subsidiary.
Mr Clark said Mr Kunkel was the unanimous choice of the board and suggested
his previous experience with Foster's, during which he reported to Mr
Bartels, would provide management continuity.
He said the appointment would not alter the company's outlook, its
commitment to maximising value for all shareholders, or its strategy of
selling non-core assets to become a single purpose brewer.
Analysts said Mr Kunkel was regarded as an outstandingly successful head of
Molson Breweries, which was created in 1989 from a merger of Carling O'Keefe
and Molson's brewing division.
The merger resulted in greater efficiency for both companies following the
closure of a number of breweries, rationalisation of competing brands and
increased exports to the US.
Mr Clark said Mr Bartels' decision to resign 'was the result of an amicable
arrangement initiated by him in the best interests of the company and its
employees'.
Mr Bartels is understood to have been prompted to resign by the board's
decision to pay an interim dividend for the six months to December, when the
group made a net profit of ADollars 77m (USDollars 59.2m).
The decision reversed the strategy adopted by Mr Bartels and Mr Clark, who
persuaded the board to suspend dividend payments after Foster's reported a
net loss of ADollars 43m for 1990-91. Mr Bartels argued for a further delay
in resuming dividend payments, as part of his attempts to strengthen the
group's balance sheet.
He is understood to have had the support of Mr Clark and the group's
independent directors.
However, the dividend was forced through after two directors representing
Asahi Breweries of Japan, which owns 20 per cent of Foster's, voted with
directors representing International Brewing Holdings (IBH), which owns 38
per cent of Foster's.
IBH is controlled by Mr John Elliott, a former chairman and chief executive
of Foster's who built the group into an international food, finance and
pastoral group under the name Elders IXL.
Mr Elliott resigned as chairman and chief executive in the wake of a record
loss of ADollars 1.3bn in 1989-90, but remains non-executive deputy
chairman.
He has led boardroom opposition to Mr Bartels' strategy of strengthening
Foster's balance sheet by not paying dividends and seeking the highest
prices for asset sales.
The strategy was damaging to IBH, which relies on Foster's dividends for its
sole source of income to meet interest payments on debt of about ADollars
2.5bn.
Mr Elliott has also pressed for a capital return to shareholders from the
proceeds of asset sales.
Mr Bartels survived an attempted coup in November after Asahi refused to
vote for an IBH motion at Foster's annual meeting which would have prevented
the re-election of independent directors supporting Mr Bartels.
However, Asahi's decision to support IBH demands for an interim dividend
appears to have altered the balance of power in the boardroom in Mr
Elliott's favour.

DELL Computer, the fast-growing US personal computer manufacturer, yesterday
reported a 78 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net income, helped by a
particularly strong increase in European sales.
Dell has enjoyed remarkable growth over the past few years by selling
IBM-compatible PCs direct to the customer, cutting out middle-men. But it
faces increasingly tough competition in the US from rivals imitating its
strategy. For the fourth quarter the company reported net income of Dollars
15.4m, or 62 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 285.7m, compared with income
of Dollars 8.6m, or 42 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 167.3m in the
fourth quarter of last year.
For the full year it reported income of Dollars 50.9m on sales of Dollars
890m, compared with income of Dollars 27.2m on sales of Dollars 546m the
previous year.
Dell, which has been expanding rapidly in Europe, said international
revenues in the fourth quarter roughly doubled to Dollars 119.4m, while
domestic sales rose 56 per cent to Dollars 166.3m.
Despite a drop in gross margins, due to price cutting, the company said net
income as a percentage of sales rose from 5.2 to 5.4, due to a drop in
operating expenses, tax benefits associated with production from the
company's new plant in Ireland and strong management of working capital.

ELBIT Computers, an Israeli maker of military and medical computer systems
quoted on Nasdaq in the US, yesterday announced a 61 per cent rise in net
profits in 1991 to Dollars 35.6m, on sales up 13 per cent to Dollars 410m,
writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem.
Elbit, a subsidiary of Elron, a pioneering Israeli high-technology group,
said it had bucked a recent declining trend for Israel's big defence-based
industries by concentrating on military electronics where markets have held
up.
It has also begun to reap the full benefits of a move into non-military
applications. Some Dollars 8m of the 1991 profit was attributable to the
sale of shares in Elscint. Elbit became a majority shareholder in 1989 in
Elscint, an Elron stablemate which makes computer-based medical imaging
systems.
Elscint posted a 27 per cent rise in profits in 1991 to Dollars 17.1m on
sales of Dollars 191m.

cleared

<TEXT>
THE DREXEL Burnham Lambert saga has drawn to a close as claimants against
the once mighty but now defunct, US investment bank gave their support to a
Dollars 1.3bn 'global settlement plan' and a US judge approved it.
The aim is to settle the hundreds of civil claims and lawsuits brought
against the investment bank after it filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy
Protection in February 1990. Under the scheme, Mr Michael Milken, former
head of Drexel's junk bond department, would contribute another Dollars
500m, while some 200 of his former colleagues would provide Dollars 300m
from their employee partnership interests.
Added to Dollars 100m of insurance money and the Dollars 400m which Mr
Milken has paid into a Securities and Exchange Commission disgorgement fund,
this will create a Dollars 1.3bn pool. The money will be split between the
claimants under court and SEC supervision.
The approvals came from two federal agencies, the Resolution Trust Company
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
They had brought multi-billion dollar suits against Drexel and Mr Milken on
behalf of failed savings and loan associations, which had been Drexel
customers.
Last week the FDIC appeared to jeopardise the settlement when it said it
could not approve such a plan without more information about the settling
parties.
However, in court, the agency's representative said the board had approved
the deal. Officials explained that additional provisions had been attached
to the agreement providing for the release of some further information, and
allowing the agency to withdraw under certain circumstances.
The Manhattan court heard that settling claimants included the California
Insurance Commissioner, who had sued over the collapse of Executive Life, a
large Californian life company which was a Drexel customer. Also included
are the class-action suits on behalf of individual investors.
The 200 former Drexel employees have yet to sign up on their portion of the
deal, and the judge acknowledged that there was some disgruntlement over how
their relative contributions should be calculated. However, employees who do
not back the scheme and choose to continue litigation will lose the right to
immunity from any Drexel-related suits in the future.
Separately, a bankruptcy court judge was expected to approve the Drexel
'reorganisation' plan. This essentially winds up its affairs, leaving only a
small business to manage the least liquid assets.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUJI Bank and Tokai Bank, two of the largest Japanese commercial banks, have
revised their profits forecasts down sharply to account for fraudulent loan
practices uncovered last summer and the continued weakness of the stock
market.
Fuji Bank forecast pre-tax profits of Y140bn (Dollars 1.06bn) for the year
ended March 31, a 26.3 per cent reduction from earlier predictions. In 1990
Fuji made pre-tax profits of Y204bn.
The bank said that it made a transfer to reserves to cover loan losses
arising from fraud and weak stock prices but did not specify the amounts set
aside.
The main loan loss from fraud is likely to arise from Y17bn loans advanced
by finance companies which were secured on forged certificates of deposit
supplied by a Fuji bank employee. Mr Taizo Hashida, chairman, resigned
following the discovery of the fraud.
Tokai Bank, the seventh largest Japanese bank by assets, said that it had
made a Y50bn specific provision to cover losses arising from a similar fraud
uncovered in July.
The bank has said that it will assume full responsibility for Y62.5bn loans
made by finance companies to Tokai clients, although it remains unclear
whether any of the loans are recoverable.
The provision contributed to a 24.5 per cent cut in Tokai's profit forecast
for the current financial year. The bank now expects to report pre-tax
profits of Y83bn.

HONG Kong Aircraft Engineering Company (Haeco), the Swire Pacific group
company which holds a monopoly on commercial aircraft maintenance and
engineering in Hong Kong, recorded a 10.8 per cent increase in net profit in
1991 to HKDollars 320.6m (Dollars 41.36), up from HKDollars 289.4m in 1990.
Haeco achieved a 12.8 per cent improvement in turnover to HKDollars 1.806bn,
despite the weak traffic levels resulting from the Gulf war. However, profit
margins remained under pressure from the tight labour market.
Losses were suffered by the 29 per cent-owned associate Asta Aircraft
Services, an Australian aircraft maintenance company.
This was acquired in February 1991 to get around capacity constraints in
Hong Kong and cap the impact of the brain drain on ethnic Chinese
engineering staff, by providing emigration opportunities.
Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, said big contracts had been awarded to Asta by All
Nippon Airways and British Airways, and a new hangar had been commissioned.
The company is expected to be marginally profitable in 1992.
Haeco's Hong Kong operations saw an increased level of line maintenance work
in 1991, while airframe maintenance benefited from the acquisition of five
Boeing 747-400's by Swire group airline Cathay Pacific last year.
Looking forward, Mr Sutch said the company's airframe maintenance facilities
were already fully committed for 1992, while overhaul work should remain at
'satisfactory' levels.
Haeco recommended a final dividend of 58 cents, representing a full-year
pay-out of 81 cents, compared with one of 76 cents in 1990.

battle

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINORITY shareholders in Au Printemps, the Parisian stores group, yesterday
lost an important court battle to secure more generous bid terms from
Pinault, the timber-to-furniture retailing group.
The move, coming in the shadow of the legal battle for control of the
Perrier mineral water group, is expected to increase support for a change in
French takeover regulations.
These currently oblige a buyer to bid for only 66 per cent of a company's
shares once a third of the equity has been acquired.
A full bid is only triggered once the 50 per cent threshold is passed.
Au Printemps' minority shareholders took action on the grounds that they
believed Pinault had artificially arranged for the expiry of some of the
voting rights in a stake it had bought in Au Printemps last November, so as
to bring its investment in the stores group below 50 per cent.
The seller, the Swiss holding group Maus-Nordmann, had made double voting
rights on some of the shares expire by selling them to one of its
subsidiaries before on-selling to Pinault, they argued. Pinault should have
accordingly extended its FFr5.3bn (Dollars 940m) offer for two-thirds of Au
Printemps to all the shareholders.
However, the Paris appeal court concluded that Pinault had legitimately
bought 37.3 per cent of Au Printemps' voting rights, and that it therefore
did not need to make a full bid. Au Printemps' share price dropped by 4 per
cent within minutes of the announcement.
The finance ministry is consulting stock market organisations and employers'
groups, which want an end to the 66 per cent rule, so that full bids would
be triggered on the critical threshold.
Failure to reform the three-year-old regulation could hamper the country's
attempts to attract big institutional investors, they argue.

<TEXT>
THE EAST Asiatic Company, which has extensive interests in the Far East,
North America and Europe, plans to step up its dividend, despite a fall in
net profits to DKr355m (Dollars 55.1m), the lowest figure for six years.
Group sales increased by 13 per cent to DKr18.64bn. Earnings after net
financial items were down from DKr513m to DKr400m and the group return on
equity in the parent company fell from 8.8 to 7.8 per cent.
However the company, which expects net profits to start climbing again this
year, is increasing its 1991 dividend from 5 per cent to 9 per cent.
Mr Henning Sparso, supervisory board chairman, said results at the North
American graphics equipment and Plumrose food divisions were hit by the US
recession.
Operating profits on North and central American operations fell from DKr167m
to DKr81m, on sales down from DKr4.65bn to DKr4.31bn. In Europe, a 1990
operating loss of DKr89m became a profit of DKr133m, on sales up from
DKr5.55bn to DKr6.48bn. In Asia, operating profits increased from DKr364m to
DKr415m on sales up from DKr4.23bn to DKr5.03bn.
The group has five functional divisions: graphics equipment, trading,
consumer products, Plumrose foods, and energy and property.
Mr Sparso said the dividend increase was 'pedagogically correct', reflecting
the board's conviction that the group was showing a generally sound and
positive development.
He said the company was budgeting for a sales increase of 16 per cent for
the current year, and an increase in profits before depreciation and
financial items of around a third.

SANDVIK, the Swedish specialty steel and carbide group, yesterday reported a
29 per cent fall in profits after financial items, to SKr1.9bn (Dollars
315m) for 1991.
It plans a dividend increase to SKr9 from SKr8.50 despite the earnings
decline. It also expects demand is likely to remain slack this year, with a
possible further fall in profits if the recession deepens.
Sales fell 4 per cent to SKr17.5bn as orders dropped 5 per cent. All
divisions experienced weaker earnings.
The cemented carbide group, the company's biggest unit, saw earnings slip by
25 per cent to SKr1.18bn. Earnings for the steel division tumbled by 42 per
cent to SKr279m, while the saws and tools unit posted a SKr16bn loss against
a profit of SKr91m in 1990.
The Process systems division had the smallest earnings decline, with a 16
per cent drop to SKr166m.
Sandvik said it would eliminate 1,000 jobs this year from its labour force
of more than 26,000, and has reserved funds in its 1991 accounts for this
restructuring measure.
Kemira, the Finnish state-owned chemical group, yesterday reported a pre-tax
loss of FM522m (Dollars 116m) for 1991, against a profit of FM139m in 1990.
It blamed weak demand for titanium dioxides and fertilisers, two of its main
product areas.
The price of fertiliser also fell in Europe last year due to growing imports
from eastern Europe. Sales fell 5 per cent to FM10.8bn.
Profitability was also harmed by rationalisation measures, including the
closure of facilities in Finland, Sweden, the UK and Belgium. However,
Kemira expects results to show a recovery this year.

<TEXT>
GENERALE Bank group, Belgium's largest, has posted a 19.6 per cent gain for
last year, bringing net consolidated profit up from BFr8bn (Dollars 234m) in
1990 to BFr9.6bn in 1991.
The bank, which is to raise its ordinary net dividend from BFr270 to BFr300,
said gross income rose 10 per cent due to better margins on Belgian franc
and foreign currency lending, and a higher return on shareholdings.
At the same time, Generale increased its transfer to reserves to BFr13bn
last year to guard against a rise in bad domestic debts because of the
slowdown in the Belgian economy. The parent bank in Belgium continued to
prune its staff.
The group's consolidated overheads, however, showed a 5 per cent increase,
partly because they include for the first time Banque Parisienne de Credit,
in which Generale raised its stake to 70 per cent at the end of last year.
Despite the domestic slowdown, private-sector lending rose by 10 per cent.
However, loans to the Belgian public sector fell as the government pursued
its austerity policy in a bid to qualify for European monetary union by the
end of this century.
The group's consolidated balance sheet ended the year at BFr2,569bn,
compared with BFr2,356bn at end-1990.

NET earnings at Eridania, the Italian agro-industrial company controlled by
Ferruzzi group, should rise this year, although probably not by as much as
the 12 per cent forecast at the operating level, said Mr Renato Picco,
chairman, writes Haig Simonian.
Speaking on the eve of the Verona agricultural fair, Mr Picco stressed that
the improved profits would mean this year's dividend would be at least
maintained. However, he remained cautious as to the possibilities of a
dividend increase.
Eridania's full figures and dividend will be released later this month. Mr
Picco said sales had climbed to 'just under L10,100bn (Dollars 8.03bn)' from
L9,165bn in 1990, while gross operating profits had grown by around 15 per
cent to over L1,000bn.

FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: BSN boosts beer interests with
24% of San Miguel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BSN, France's leading food group, is to strengthen its position in Spanish
brewing by buying a 24 per cent stake in San Miguel.
The acquisition, at an undisclosed price, is a valuable addition to BSN's
beer interests, which already include 33 per cent of Mahou, another Spanish
brewer.
BSN, under the chairmanship of Mr Antoine Riboud, is Europe's second largest
beer group, with market leadership in France and Italy and strong positions
in Spain, Belgium and Greece. Its other brands include Kronenbourg,
Kanterbrau, Maes Pils and Peroni.
However, BSN's beer business is less international than some of its other
activities, in biscuits, mineral water and dairy products. In 1990, the beer
division made 82 per cent of its FFr6.6bn (Dollars 1.18bn) sales in France,
out of total group sales of FFr52.9bn.
The San Miguel stake was sold by the March group. The purchase was made with
the agreement of other investor groups, and leaves the family shareholders
in majority control.
The acquisition, valued at Pta13bn (Dollars 125m) at current Madrid stock
market prices, gives BSN a stake in the Spanish beer market rivalling that
of Guinness, which has a market share in excess of 20 per cent.
San Miguel is the fifth biggest domestic brewer with a market quota of some
14 per cent. The other main foreign player in Spain's beer sector is
Heineken, which owns 51 per cent of El Aguila, the second biggest brewer.
The deal highlights the current drive by one of Spain's premier family
controlled holding companies to realise its assets. Last week it announced
it was selling a 15.5 per cent stake in Signet Banking Corporation of the
US.
The group had earlier unveiled plans to raise as much as Pta50bn through the
sale of its electric utility interests in Spain. It is also understood to be
seeking buyers for certain chemical companies it owns, as well as partners
for its two domestic banks, Banco Urquijo and Banco de Progreso.

<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Degussa, the German metals, chemicals, and
pharmaceuticals group, rose by 5 per cent to DM43m (Dollars 26m) in the
first quarter of this year. However Mr Gert Becker, the chief executive,
said results would only show a marked improvement for the full year if the
world chemical market recovered.
The company plans a number of fund-raising moves this year. It will launch a
rights issue and plans to float off a minority stake in its pharmaceutical
subsidiary, Asta Medica, when stock market conditions are suitable. Asta's
turnover, including the newly acquired business in east Germany, is around
DM1.3bn.
Mr Becker said Degussa's profits last year stemmed from chemicals and
pharmaceuticals. It had cut losses at its Leybold high technology unit and
was seeking a partner for this business. Eventually, Leybold could also be
partly floated off to the public, he said.
Degussa's restructuring measures had made the company 'significantly more
robust' than in the previous year, he added. Group restructuring costs
exceeded DM100m in the financial year to September 1991, with the labour
force reduced by more than 2,000.
The company intends to shed a further 1,000 jobs by autumn next year, as it
reduces its central administrative and research staff. 'We are in a period
of radical change,' Mr Becker said.
For last year, Degussa cut its dividend from DM11 to DM7 after a drop in net
income last year of 33 per cent to DM99m.
Degussa is concentrating more on its non-German activities to be closer to
world markets. Foreign investments were higher than those at home for the
first time last year. Investments abroad, chiefly in the US, India, Taiwan
and Brazil, made up 55 per cent of the DM783m total, which was up by 15 per
cent on the previous year.
Mr Robert Ehrt, finance director, said this year's capital spending would
total up to DM650m. Around 70 per cent of turnover, which dropped by 7 per
cent to DM3bn in the first quarter, is achieved abroad.

GENERALI, Italy's biggest insurance company, yesterday forecast higher
earnings for 1991, despite continuing heavy underwriting losses on non-life
business, particularly in Italy.
Releasing preliminary figures for last year, the company said the 'positive'
trends stemming from life insurance earnings and a slight let-up in the rate
of cost rises had failed to make up for non-life underwriting losses.
However, investment income and extraordinary gains would allow it to report
earnings above the L351.2bn (Dollars 282m) made by the parent company after
tax in 1990, despite the additional burden imposed by a government
requirement to bring forward certain property tax payments last year.
Non-consolidated premiums rose by around 14.5 per cent to L7,200bn in 1991.
Generali gave no indication of consolidated group premiums, which amounted
to L13,670bn in 1990, but said premiums from other companies it controlled
rose by around 12 per cent to almost L11,000bn in 1991.
Non-life premiums rose by around 12.6 per cent, with premiums on the life
side jumping by 17.2 per cent. No absolute figures were given. Domestically,
non-life premiums rose by 10 per cent to almost L2,400bn, while life
premiums rose by almost 19 per cent to L1,350bn.
Investment income rose by 20.8 per cent, while the value of Generali's
overall investment portfolio surged by almost 30 per cent to over L21,200bn
from L16,300bn in 1990. No explanations for the increases were given.
More detailed figures should be available on May 5, when the company's board
meets to consider its 1991 results.
Alitalia, the Italian state-controlled airline, wants to stay out of
alliances, Reuter reports.
'Among all the alliances that have been announced I have not yet seen one
that really worked,' managing director, Mr Giovanni Bisignani, said.
'Even the gurus of air transport seem to have changed their minds on the
subject of link-ups,' he said. 'We at Alitalia prefer to achieve critical
size by ourselves.'

Taxable profits of Clondalkin Group, the Dublin-based company involved in
printing and packaging, expanded from IPounds 11.9m to IPounds 13.6m (Pounds
12.7m) in 1991 with the strongest growth coming from the US.
A number of factors were responsible for static sales of IPounds 151.1m

Tax at 24 per cent (21 per cent) accounted for IPounds 3.22m (IPounds 2.5m)
and left earnings at 25.08p (22.64p). A proposed final dividend of 2.683p
makes a 4.381p (4.056p) total.
At year-end net debt had been reduced from IPounds 10.6m to IPounds 1.58m.
Directors are to seek shareholders' approval for the purchase of up to 15

Conrad Continental, the Manchester-based leisurewear and sports group,
yesterday reported a virtual break-even in the second half of 1991.
The pre-tax loss for the year emerged at Pounds 378,000 compared with a
first half loss of Pounds 380,000 and with a loss of Pounds 680,000 for the
whole of 1990.
In a deal worth up to Pounds 750,000 Conrad is acquiring Matchwinner, a
Glasgow-based supplier of replica strips and related products for sports
clubs.
Conrad expects to sign agreements to supply a further two clubs before the
start of the 1992/3 season.
Mr Bobby Charlton, former Manchester United and England international
footballer and a director of Conrad, said that Conrad had a leading presence
in worldwide sports coaching and promotion and this acquisition represents
an opportunity to enhance this position.
Turnover of continuing businesses for 1991 amounted to Pounds 7.86m,
compared with Pounds 6.31m. Losses per share came out at 1.7p (3.51p) and
again there is no dividend.

FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: 27% take-up for Bromsgrove rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bromsgrove Industries, the Birmingham-based specialist engineering
conglomerate, yesterday announced that only 27.5 per cent of shareholders
had taken up its 1-for-4 rights issue at 105p per share to raise Pounds
10.75m.
The balance has been subscribed for by underwriters, which include a number
of Bromsgrove's institutional shareholders. The shares yesterday closed 1p
up at 104p.
Mr Stephen Hayes, finance director, said the take up was in line with
expectations since a significant amount of the group's big shareholders had
underwritten the cash call.
Institutional shareholders, which held 70 per cent of the stock before the
cash call, now hold about 80 per cent of Bromsgrove's shares.
The rights issue should eliminate gearing, which, at end-September, was 31
per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Unigroup, the building products and garment manufacturer,
fell from Pounds 708,000 to Pounds 304,000 in the six months to
end-December.
Mr Tunku Imran, chairman, said that although the timber division continued
to perform satisfactorily the building products division had been severely
affected by the economic situation in Europe and the UK in particular.
The clothing division continued to suffer from low high street demand and
reduced margins and the company is evaluating its future.
Turnover rose to Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 11.1m) but operating profits fell to
Pounds 562,000 (Pounds 854,000) and there were increased interest and other
charges of Pounds 258,000 (Pounds 146,000).
Earnings per share dropped from 1.9p to 0.58p.

Castle Communications, which markets audio and visual rights, saw pre-tax
profits improve from Pounds 759,000 to Pounds 853,000 in the six months to
December 31.
The results for the USM-quoted company were helped by cost cutting,
including the closure of a number of subsidiaries and higher profits from
licensing activities.
As a result of the closures turnover fell to Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 19.4m).
Earnings per share came out at 7.4p (7.1p) and the interim dividend is being

Castle owns a substantial number of 1960s and 1970s recorded music
copyrights which it is having revalued 'in view of the current interest in

FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Pacer Dollars 1.14m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DELAYS on a US Navy contract led Pacer Systems, the USM-traded defence
electronics company based in Massachusetts, to report a pre-tax loss.
Losses for the year to end-December totalled Dollars 1.14m (Pounds 640,000).
compared with Dollars 1.56m profit last time.
Mr John Rennie, chairman, said Pacer lost Dollars 3m on a fixed price US
navy contract for an acoustic signal generator, a device which can be used
to simulate underwater acoustics or as part of an anti-submarine system. Due
for delivery last year, the first device was not supplied until earlier this
month.
Turnover slipped 10 per cent to Dollars 25.2m (Dollars 27.9m). This was due
to lower sales of the company's flight simulators and air data systems,
chiefly used on helicopters such as the Apache.
Losses per share totalled 13 cents (earnings 8 cents). But Mr Rennie said
the company's prospects remained favourable and the directors have proposed
a same-again final dividend of 3.5 cents, making an unchanged total of 6.5
cents.

FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: James Capel back in black at Pounds 9m -
Closures, cost cutting and avoidance of accidents help result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES CAPEL, the broker owned by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation,
managed its best year since before the 1987 stock market crash with a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 9.1m in 1991 for Pounds 6.1m after tax.
The result, due to a renewed round of cost-cutting and the closure or sale
of loss-making activities, followed losses of Pounds 30.3m in 1990. However,
the result still amounted to a return of little more than 5 per cent on
capital compared with the returns of 20 per cent to 25 per cent which most
in the industry consider desirable.
Mr Bernard Asher, put in by HKSB as executive chairman a year ago after the
disastrous 1990 losses, moved quickly to cut costs. Some 300 jobs were shed
during the year, about half of them in the UK, taking the total staff to
about 2,300.
Costs have been cut sharply at the Paris operation, with a staff now of
about 130, compared with 250 little more than a year ago, in the wake of
difficult conditions for broking firms generally and losses on options
market making.
The loss-making Australian operations were also cut drastically during the
year, with staff falling from 130 to 60.
Mr Asher, who is also chairman of Wardley, HKSB's merchant banking arm, shed
some peripheral parts of the business, such as money broking, which had held
the firm back.
However, the turnround from 1990 owed more to businesses closed before he
took over: convertibles, where trading losses had accounted for about half
of the full-year loss, and fixed income, which was moved to the parent bank.
The 1991 profit was also due in large part to Capel's success in avoiding
its accident-prone ways of recent years, when it has periodically incurred
heavy trading losses. These had led to a poor relationship between the firm
and its parent, said to have been repaired by the appointment of Mr Asher,
though at the cost of the firm's independence.
Last year saw an improvement in the performance of Capel's UK equities side,
its traditional core, said Mr James Fergusson, managing director.
After the departure of some leading analysts and a decline in the firm's
showing in polls of fund managers, Capel says its market share has returned
to about 9 per cent.

FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Sunrise Television spurns critics'
forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUNRISE TELEVISION yesterday attacked forecasts by Mr Bruce Gyngell,
chairman of TV-am, that the new commercial breakfast television company
could be out of business within 18 months.
Mr Christopher Stoddart, managing director of Sunrise, which will take over
from TV-am on January 1, described Mr Gyngell's figures as 'highly
misleading' and insisted that the new broadcasting group would make a modest
profit in its first year on air.
The TV-am chairman said last week that Sunrise was expecting revenues of
Pounds 117m in 1995, compared with TV-am's forecast of Pounds 82m, and that
the new company had underestimated the growing impact of satellite
television on the breakfast audience.
Mr Stoddart said yesterday his revenue forecasts for 1995 were 'in the
Pounds 80 millions' and the Sunrise prediction on satellite television was
at the top end of most forecasts - just under 50 per cent of homes in the
last years of the century.
Sunrise, which won the breakfast franchise with a bid of Pounds 36.4m a year
compared with TV-am's Pounds 14.125m, is backed by the Guardian and
Manchester Evening News, London Weekend Television, Scottish Television,
Disney and Carlton Communications.
Mr Stoddart said yesterday that at least Pounds 10m of the difference
between the Sunrise and TV-am bid would be accounted for by lower costs.
The second Pounds 10m could be accounted for by accepting lower profit
levels than TV-am. Last year the breakfast company had pre-tax profits of
Pounds 26m. The whole basis of payments is also different with the ending of
subscription payments to fund Channel 4 and the fact that bids are tax
deductible.
'Our shareholders view is that this basis (of a lower profit level) is
absolutely satisfactory,' Mr Stoddart said.
The Sunrise managing director believes that he can extend TV-am's dominant
share of the breakfast television audience although he has budgeted for a
small decline just in case.
The plans now being drawn up by Sunrise reveal a very cost-effective and
flexible operation which will spend some Pounds 30m a year on programmes and
employ only 115 people.
Ms Lis Howell, director of programmes and a former senior executive at Sky
News, has decided to abandon formal news bulletins and instead produce a
rolling magazine programme. There will be headlines every 15 minutes but
apart from that the 'news' items will simply be imbedded in in the
programme's running order.
'It will be a Good Morning magazine with something for all the family,' says
Ms Howell.
'Everything will have a topical base but we will not be a slave to a false
news agenda,' she adds.
If it is a dull news day Sunrise will say so, and there will be less news on
that edition.
Sunrise says it will also save money by buying in its news service from
Visnews, the international news agency.
Under the deal Sunrise will have dedicated Visnews camera crews, including
eight crews in London and three dedicated news bureaux in Moscow, Washington
and Brussels.
Sunrise expects to spend about Pounds 10m a year on news, not including
deals with most of the ITV companies, to inject three-minute bursts of local
news, weather and traffic for the various regions.
Sunrise will broadcast its entire programme, lasting almost three-and-a-half
hours, from a single studio at LWT's London Television Centre on the South
Bank, which will be like the open plan downstairs of a house.
The 'hosts' in the American television sense will preside from a round
table. In other parts of the domestic setting there will be a sofa for
softer interviews, a kitchen and a childrens' area.
Mr Gyngell's insistence on cheerful pink shirts will not survive the loss of
franchise but Ms Howell will adopt some of the hallmarks of her predecessor.
'We will have light relaxing colours because they work,' says Ms Howell, who
believes that breakfast television should be reassuring and designed to
convey the message that 'God's in her heaven and all's right with the
world.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUDDY FOX, the Wembley-based company whose fox's pawprint has become one of
the best-known trademarks in the world bicycle industry, has been placed in
administrative receivership because of a downturn in sales and financial
difficulties.
Mr Nick Lyle and Mr Nigel Atkinson, partners in Touche Ross, have been
appointed as joint administrative receivers for the privately-held company,
which was formed in 1983.
Turnover increased from Pounds 2m in 1987 to Pounds 8.5m last year, building
on the reputation of its bikes, which in the UK cost between Pounds 98 and
Pounds 1,350, for ruggedness and reliability. But competition has
intensified at both the premium end of the market through the entrance of
Cannondale and Trek, two strong US producers, and in the cheaper ranges.
Mr Lyle said yesterday that the company had 'a prestige range of mountain
bikes of appeal to both rural or urban users. We hope to sell the business
as a going concern together with its valuable registered trademark. The
level of interest in the company so far is very encouraging.' Muddy Fox
bicycles are manufactured mainly in the Far East from UK designs. There are
distribution centres in London and Germany supplying a European dealership
network.

FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: ICI in Pounds 50m venture to make CFC
replacement
</HEADLINE>

   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI is to invest Pounds 25m in a joint venture in Japan to make
ozone-friendly refrigerants. Its partner is Teijin, the Osaka-based fibres
and chemicals company.
The venture will build a Pounds 50m plant at Mihara, near Hiroshima, the
site of an existing collaboration between the two companies to make
agricultural products.
Teijin will be responsible for the production of the material, Klea 134a.
ICI, which developed it, will market it for use in refrigerators and air
conditioning units. 'We are the first with plants in Europe, North America
and Asia to make CFC replacements,' said ICI Fluorochemicals yesterday.
Klea 134a is designed to replace chlorofluorocarbons, which are blamed for
damaging the atmosphere's ozone layer.
The new factory will serve Asian-Pacific markets and will have an initial
capacity of 5,000 tons a year when it comes on stream in 1993. ICI said it
was in talks with vehicle makers in the region on supplying the chemical for
air conditioning systems. Possible customers include vehicle manufacturers
in China and Australia.
The market for CFC replacements is growing rapidly as governments respond to
the environmental dangers by insisting that alternatives are used. General
Motors is to use Klea 134a from an ICI plant in Louisiana in its cars and
truck air conditioning systems.
ICI's first Klea 134a plant, in Runcorn, Cheshire, opened in 1990.

FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Marling warns of loss as sales fall is
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARLING INDUSTRIES, the industrial textile and vehicle body manufacturer,
has warned of a loss for the year to March 31 1992. The company's shares
fell 29p to 67p on Monday but held that level yesterday.
Mr David Abel Smith, formerly managing director of Benjamin Priest, the
Midlands engineering group, was appointed chief executive of Marling in
January. He is carrying out a review of the group's businesses and expects
to report in two months' time.
In December Marling blamed a drop in demand at Boalloy, its commercial
vehicle body manufacturer, when it reported a drop in interim pre-tax
profits from Pounds 2.85m to Pounds 593,000 and cut its dividend.
Marling said yesterday that turnover in the second half would be well below
the Pounds 51.64m achieved in the first half, and the group would show a
loss before taxation and reorganisation costs. In the year to March 31,
1991, Marling made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.6m on sales of Pounds 121.8m.
Marling is building up manufacturing facilities in its joint venture with
Electrolux to produce one-piece airbags for automobile passenger protection.
Mr Abel Smith said it would be some time before it would be possible to
forecast when that venture would contribute to group profits.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOLIDAY Inn, the international hotel chain owned by Britain's Bass group,
yesterday announced a Dollars 60m (Pounds 34m) upgrading of its computer
reservation system.
One advantage, according to Holiday Inn, of new software is its ability to
factor in the desired length of stay, as well as price and room availability
on a given night.
The company explained yesterday that a customer who wanted a room, at a
certain price, for several days would currently be turned away if it were
not available on the first of those nights.
The more sophisticated software, however, would check whether such a room
was available for later nights, and then adjust back to offer a different
room, at the given price, for the first night.
Holiday Inn acknowledged that the new system might reduce average room
rates, but claimed that improved occupancy levels - estimated at three
percentage points - should outweigh that. It calculated lost revenues of
around Dollars 125m in the US as a result of the current inability to
include length-of-stay considerations.
Installation of the improved hardware and software, which are financed by
Holiday Inn and come at no cost to franchisees, will begin in the autumn,
and should be in all properties within two and a half years.

FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Blackwood Hodge acquisition boosts BM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BENEFITS of buying Blackwood Hodge, the international distributor of
earth-moving equipment, showed through in BM Group's results for the six
months to December 31. The company also announced it had taken a controlling
stake in British Building and Engineering Appliances.
Pre-tax profit at the construction equipment distributor and engineer
advanced by 28 per cent to Pounds 17.3m (Pounds 13.5m) on turnover of Pounds
229.3m (Pounds 148.8m). Interest costs rose by nearly Pounds 2m to Pounds
5.68m.
Blackwood, which was incurring losses before the takeover, was included for
six months instead of about seven weeks. Mr Carl Young, finance director,
said that 50 per cent of the group's first-half sales and Pounds 4.5m of
profit could be attributed to it.
The picture was, however, complicated by the sale of BM products, such as
Mustang skid steer loaders and Benford dumpers, through the Blackwood
network.
The UK's share of group turnover had fallen to 35 per cent. It would rise to
about 50 per cent with the inclusion of Thomas Robinson, the engineering
group acquired three weeks ago in a Pounds 41m all-share deal.
Mr Roger Shute, chairman, said that in North America, Mustang had increased
its US sales by 55 per cent. Canada was showing signs of recovery.
Net debt stood at about Pounds 88m at the end of December. After the Pounds
60m rights issue accompanying the Robinson deal, gearing had fallen below 45
per cent.
Diluted earnings rose to 13.3p (11.3p). The interim dividend goes up to 2.1p
(1.6p).
BM intends to inject its UK building products activities - approaching
Pounds 50m of annual turnover - into BB and EA, where it has paid Pounds
2.5m for a 58 per cent family stake, taking its holding to 83.7 per cent. It
has to extend its 355p a share offer to other shareholders, but only plans
to retain 75 per cent.
COMMENT
When BM bought the struggling Blackwood Hodge, there was concern that it
would be dragged down by it. The reverse has happened, partly because of the
admirable ruthlessness applied to Blackwood's costs and partly because of
the scope provided by acquisition accounting for shoving the write-offs
below the line. Blackwood could not afford to attack its languishing UK
operation because of unrelieved ACT, BM has done it and can tap tax losses.
The commercial synergy has proved just as strong, with a new world of
outlets opened up to BM's manufactured goods. Thomas Robinson, more of a
ragbag, may take longer to bear fruit. For the full year, a repeat of last
year's second-half performance, plus further savings, should see pre-tax
profit rise to between Pounds 40m and Pounds 45m (Pounds 34.1m), a
prospective p/e of 13 on yesterday's close of 405p. As a certain amount has
to be taken on trust - there was, for instance, no divisional breakdown -
this seems high enough until a new wave of analysts has been convinced of
BM's, and not just Mr Shute's, merits.

FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Logica down 54% despite good US result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOGICA, one of the few large, publicly-owned UK computing services companies
still in British ownership, saw first half pre-tax profits fall 54 per cent
despite the return to profitability of its troubled North American
subsidiary.
The fall in profits - from Pounds 4.67m to Pounds 2.15m - was caused by
write-offs following a decision to pull out of a loss making venture in
television technology. Turnover for the six months to end December was 3 per
cent up at Pounds 98.6m (Pounds 96.1m). Earnings per share came out at 2.1p
compared with 4.4p last time.
The interim dividend is being maintained at 1.15p, a reflection, according
to Mr David Mann, managing director, of the uncertainty of the six months
ahead.
The company finished the period with broadly unchanged cash balances of
Pounds 14.9m. The share price fell 4p to 187p.
Logica's profitability in recent years has been hindered by its North
American losses; the US operation, however, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds
400,000 - the consequence of restructuring and tight financial control -
compared with a loss of Pounds 1.8m last time.
Overall operating profits were reduced by some Pounds 1.6m as a result of
the company's decision to withdraw from a project called 'Playout' dealing
with the automation of television studios. The loss was unexpected and
surprised analysts who had been anticipating first half profits of Pounds
3.5m. Logica made small losses in continental Europe despite an 8 per cent
growth in revenue as the result of acquisitions by its Italian subsidiary.
Mr Mann said associated undertakings including Speedwing Logica, a joint
venture with British Airways, were peforming well. The company, which makes
about 50 per cent of its revenues from fixed price contracts, has customers
including ANZ Bank in Australasia, the Public Records Office in the UK and
the European Space Agency.

<TEXT>
THE SEVERE downturn in the vehicles market pushed Plaxton Group, the coach
manufacturer and motor distributor, into a Pounds 6.8m pre-tax loss for the
year to December 31.
That was a swing of Pounds 11m compared with the profit of Pounds 4.2m
returned for the preceding 12 months.
Mr Robert Wood, chief executive, said demand for coaches and buses had
fallen by about 40 per cent last year, while the new car market had declined
by 21 per cent. Turnover fell from Pounds 385.1m to Pounds 334.4m.
As a result, the group had closed three of its four coach and bus plants and
cut 600 jobs over the last 18 months. Annual overheads in the bus and coach
division had been cut by Pounds 4m and the operation incurred a loss of
Pounds 2.96m. The restructuring and introduction of new coach ranges
resulted in exceptional charges of Pounds 2.86m. A further Pounds 2.1m in
extraordinary charges arose from the closure of a coach factory in France.
Coach and bus stocks had been reduced by about Pounds 7m. Mr Wood said the
group aimed to cut stocks by a further Pounds 6m to Pounds 8m. He said he
did not expect a significant recovery in the coach division until 1993.
Operating profits in the motor division tumbled by 47 per cent to Pounds
3.5m. Mr Wood said virtually all of the decline was due to falling demand
for new cars.
To highlight the importance of the motor division, which represents 70 per
cent of turnover, Plaxton plans to change its name to Henlys, the title of
the distributor purchased in 1989.
Interest charges were unchanged at Pounds 4.7m, although Plaxton said the
year-end debt of Pounds 31m now included Pounds 7m previously held off
balance sheet.
A proposed final dividend of 2p (1.5p) makes a 3p (4.5p) total. Losses per
share of 16.7p compared with earnings of 9.1p.
The group announced yesterday that Mr Derek Edwards, a former director of
RTZ, would become the board's second non-executive director. Mr Michael
Doherty was appointed non-executive chairman in November.
COMMENT
The increased final dividend indicates that Plaxton is confident of more
than just survival. The high stock levels of a year ago have been reduced to
sustainable levels - and still there is more to come; the motor division is
returning a profit, unlike many competitors; and new management appears
determined to quash criticisms by bringing all debt on balance sheet.
Assuming the economy does not get worse, it could well be that Plaxton has
defied the sceptics. Forecasts are pitched at breakeven to Pounds 1m
profits, although the coach business will continue to incur losses.
Risk-takers may find the stock attractive, while the more cautious are
likely to wait for definitive proof in the next set of results.

FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Strong &amp; Fisher back in the black with
Pounds 2.43m
</HEADLINE>

   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG &amp; Fisher, the leather company rescued from the brink of insolvency by
Hillsdown Holdings, is celebrating its return to the black last year by
resuming ordinary dividend payments.
The UK's leading sheepskin processor - 70 per cent owned by Hillsdown - is
paying 1p to ordinary shareholders, their first dividend since the 2p
interim in December 1989.
The group, which has been reporting in three six-month tranches to bring it
into line with Hillsdown, also unveiled a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.43m for
the 18 months to December 31. In the final 12 months, Strong &amp; Fisher
reported a profit of Pounds 9.9m.
The last full accounting period covered the 12 months to June 29 1990 when
the group incurred a loss of Pounds 17.52m.
Mr Michel Buswell, chairman, said the group was now financially sound. All
four divisions - hide and skin collecting and trading, fellmongery, tanning
and rendering - had been profitable in the final 12 months.
Strong had between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m cash in the bank and planned to
make an acquisition within the next year to reduce its dependence on
leather, Mr Buswell said. The purchase was likely to be in a manufacturing
industry.
The results were depressed by an exceptional write-down of stocks and
current assets which, after profits on disposals, totalled Pounds 4.6m.
Earnings per share for the 18 months worked through at 0.54p. That compared
with losses of 100.6p for the previous 12-month period.

FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Saatchi predicts gloomy outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD advertising industry can expect only the faintest of upturns this
year, Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, said
yesterday as he unveiled a dismal set of results for the advertising and
marketing services group.
Worldwide revenues were likely to rise by only 1 per cent at best. But in
the US, where Saatchi generates about half its turnover, a further decline
of some 3 per cent in real terms was expected.
With group revenues showing no improvement this year, Mr Louis-Dreyfus was
planning more cost cuts - the prime target being the wage bill. The group's
12,900 employees earned an average Pounds 23,255 each last year.
Some 300 executives were earning more than Pounds 150,000 a year. They were
about to be asked to forgo large fixed salaries for the promise of
considerably more through performance bonuses when - or if - the fat days
return.
Moreover, the group still had to hand out some Pounds 30m of earn-out
payments over the next three years, only Pounds 5m of that in shares.
The City remained cautious about Saatchi's prospects after yesterday's news
of a Pounds 63.6m loss after exceptional items for the 15 months ended
December.
Mr Louis-Dreyfus said that estimates of pre-tax profits of Pounds 18m in
1992 'were not unreasonable'.
Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits rising to some Pounds 43m in 1993
and about Pounds 70m in 1994. The only immediate blip on the horizon is the
probable loss of the Dollars 30m Rover account.

FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Wates City of London net assets fall 40%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATES CITY of London, the property company, yesterday announced a 40 per
cent fall in its net assets in 1990, from 250p per share to 151p. The
pre-tax profit was Pounds 8.17m, down from Pounds 30.5m, which was boosted
by an exceptional item of Pounds 22.1m.
The worst affected part of the portfolio was the development properties
which fell by 44 per cent, while the value of investment properties fell by
18 per cent.
The decline in assets was 'clearly a most disappointing outcome', said Mr
Dundas Hamilton, chairman, although he hoped that asset values had reached
their low point. Companies were delaying office relocations and investment
purchases until after the election.
Net rental income increased from Pounds 14.8m to Pounds 15m, as rent reviews
and the acquisition of an additional investment property compensated for the
continued loss of rent on properties held for development.
At the year end, the company's borrowings were Pounds 91.2m, giving gearing
of 50 per cent. The net debt of its joint venture companies was Pounds
39.3m. Earnings per share fell from 23.19p to 4.43p. A final dividend of
2.96p is proposed giving an unchanged total of 3.73p.
COMMENT
To judge by the yawning gulf between Wates' net assets and its share price,
shareholders do not believe that the halving of the net asset value over the
last two years is the end of the story. The share price, having fallen by 14
per cent over the past three weeks to 70p, is on a 54 per cent discount to
net assets. In part, this reflects concern about the difficulties in
securing tenants for development properties, although the pain will be
shared with its joint venture partners. More generally, Wates is hemmed into
virtually the worst property market ever seen in the UK. The square mile is
suffering disproportionately from the building bonanza of the late 1980s,
the recession in the financial services industry and the evaporation of
foreign investment which pushed up prices on trophy buildings. Many analysts
do not expect a re-emergence of capital growth until 1994. Even though Wates
is largely seen as a well managed company with good tenants and good
buildings, investors are unlikely to be drawn to a stock where recovery
prospects are so distant.

FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: DTI to investigate more share dealings
connected with Wace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry yesterday widened its investigation
into share dealings connected with Wace Group, the printing company.
The two DTI inspectors investigating Wace are now looking at share dealings
in two further quoted companies - Tinsley Robor, a printing company which
Wace considered taking over in early 1990, and in European Colour, a
Stockport-based manufacturer of chemical colours.
The DTI said yesterday that the share deals it was investigating 'might have
been a preliminary to a possible takeover or merger' but that it was not
looking at the affairs of either company.
The DTI declined to comment on the targets of the inquiry but it is
understood that one of the share deals in the inquiry is a 7.1 per cent
stake in European Colour in the name of J Riley.
European Colour could not confirm yesterday whether this shareholder was Mrs
Jayne Riley, the half sister of Mr John Clegg, Wace's managing director who
resigned suddenly two months ago.
However, Mr Mike Armitage, managing director of European Colour, said the J
Riley shareholding, shown in the accounts dated March 1991, had
'transmogrified' out of a 5 per cent shareholding of a K Riley, bought in
October 1986, when the company was known as Horace Cory. Mrs Jayne Riley's
husband is Mr Keith Riley.
Following Mr Clegg's departure, the DTI launched an inquiry under Section
442 of the Companies Act into the 'membership' of Wace Holdings UK, a
subsidiary of Wace Group previously known as Parkway, a printing company
which Wace took over in 1990. 'Membership' covers all persons financially
interested in the company.
A dossier passed by Wace to the DTI showed that nearly 10 per cent of the
shares in Parkway had been bought and registered in the names of members of
Mr Clegg's family and others connected with them in the months before Wace's
bid.
Many of the share purchases were in the names of Mrs Jayne Riley and Mr
Keith Riley.
Mr Clegg has said through his solicitors that he has 'never acted on nor
provided to others any price-sensitive information' and is happy to
co-operate with the DTI.
A similar pattern of buying Tinsley Robor shares about the time of Wace's
interest has subsequently emerged, with registration in many of the same
names - including that of Mr Keith Riley.
Yesterday, Mr Armitage said that European Colour had never received an
approach from Wace about a takeover or merger, but added that the company
had been trying to uncover the identity of several shareholders controlling
around 7 per cent for several years.
It had found this search 'exceptionally difficult' because of the use of
nominee names by some shareholders, but was now 'aware of links' between
several beneficiaries.

FT  11 MAR 92 / BASF and Hoechst to cut their dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BASF and Hoechst, two of Germany's big three chemicals companies, both
announced yesterday that their pre-tax profits fell by more than 20 per cent
last year and that they intended to cut their dividends for 1991 - the first
time that the payout has been cut back since 1982.
The announcements will put pressure on Bayer, the third of the big three
chemical companies, to cut its dividend as it reports its 1991 results
today. However, because of Bayer's prospering pharmaceuticals divisions, the
drop in profits is expected to be limited to about 5 per cent.
BASF's pre-tax profits fell 23.2 per cent to DM2.11bn (Pounds 735.8m),
compared with DM2.75bn the year before, while Hoechst's pre-tax profits fell
by just over 20 per cent to DM2.56bn (DM3.22bn). This is the second year
running that their profits have dropped substantially, reflecting poor
conditions for the German chemicals sector both in the domestic market and
overseas.
The figures were in line with expectations, and the cut in the dividend  -
by DM1 to DM12 per share - was less severe than anticipated. The share
prices of the two companies rose yesterday.
'By cutting the dividend only this much,' said Ms Petra Zamatna, of the
Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt, 'the companies have reached a
compromise. They are keeping their shareholders happy and at the same time
they are giving a very clear signal that 1992 will be a difficult year as
well.'
Yesterday the companies gave the basic figures for profits and turnover, the
latter up by 5.2 per cent to DM47.19bn (DM44.86bn) at Hoechst and virtually
unchanged at BASF at DM46.63bn (DM46.62bn). The two companies will spell out
the details of last year's figures and their outlook for the current year in
the next two weeks.
Hoechst said that in a number of areas - including synthetic fibres,
plastics and dyes - it was suffering from high production costs and prices
kept low by intense competition in world markets. Analysts expect little
improvement in the current year and Mr Kiran Bhojani at MM Warburg in
Hamburg predicted that earnings at the three companies would climb by only a
fraction.
Today's dividend decision from Bayer will test the principle that the three
big companies maintain a similar dividend policy.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Saatchi falls sharply into Pounds 63m loss: Advertising
group reports worse-than-expected decline over 15-month period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAATCHI and Saatchi, the world's second largest advertising and marketing
services company, yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 63.6m for the
15 months to the end of December 1991; on a 12-month basis the pre-tax loss
was Pounds 58.4m against pre-tax profits of Pounds 35.6m for the year to
September 1990.
The larger-than-expected losses were primarily due to exceptional items
totalling Pounds 54.5m during the last 15 months, including provisions made
for leases on vacant property, as well as costs incurred in closing and
merging several small companies. Severance costs alone amounted to Pounds
20.8m in 1991 (Pounds 9.7m in 1990).
Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive, added that two companies within
the group made 'large losses' in 1991; he declined to say which companies
had performed badly, but it is believed that the group's consultancy
businesses are lagging.
Before consideration for exceptional items, the group made a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 9.1m for the 15 months. Over the 12-month period that loss was Pounds
3.5m. On a 12-month calculation, the group registered underlying declines of
2.3 per cent in revenues to Pounds 739.8m (Pounds 757.6m in 1990) and of 49
per cent in trading profits, to Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 40.2m in 1990).
Mr Louis-Dreyfus said that net debt averaged Pounds 200m in the final
quarter of 1991 and ended the year at Pounds 180m.
The group's trading figures were affected by recession in the US and the UK.
During 1990, the US accounted for a Pounds 22m trading profit, falling to
Pounds 10.2m in 1991; in the UK a 1990 trading profit of Pounds 7.2m
transformed into a trading loss of Pounds 4.3m last year. However, the group
did better in the rest of Europe, increasing trading profits from Pounds
9.4m (1990) to Pounds 14.4m (1991).
Mr Louis-Dreyfus said the group was budgeting for a slight decline in
revenues this year, though he believed that a more stable advertising market
was likely and that 1992 'will mark the start of a sustainable improvement
in operating margins and profitability'.
He added that he did not anticipate any severance costs this year, but that
a three-year phased introduction of an incentive scheme for the 300 most
senior executives would gradually reduce the Pounds 300m salary bill by 1.5
per cent of group revenues, a potential cost reduction of about Pounds 11m
annually.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Monthly returns rule to
be changed - Large Traders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor announced that large traders would not be required to submit
monthly VAT returns from autumn 1992. Instead, they will be required to make
monthly VAT payments on account from October 1992; they will continue to be
required to render VAT returns quarterly.
This decision follows consultation initiated by the chancellor in October
1991, when he announced the introduction of postponed accounting for VAT on
most EC goods from January 1 1993 and proposals for large traders to submit
monthly VAT returns from autumn 1992 to offset the consequential PSBR
effects.
Provision for monthly payments on account will be made in the Finance Bill
and present legislation will not be used.
From January 1 1993, for most Single Market goods, there will no longer be a
requirement for businesses to submit official documents at the time of
importation or to pay (or defer) the VAT due on goods before they are
released from Customs' charge.
VAT due on purchases from another member state will be accounted for under
the Postponed Accounting System (PAS) on the businesses' usual VAT return.
The PAS arrangement will mean that businesses no longer have to fund the tax
payment for imports before they are able to reclaim the tax as an input tax
deduction under the normal rules. This will give a significant cash flow
advantage to businesses engaged in intra-Community trade.
The postponed accounting arrangement means, however, that in the fiscal year
1992-93 there will be a considerable shortfall to the Exchequer. This is
because businesses will not be paying import VAT at the time of importation
(or up to six weeks later under the present system of deferring payment). To
offset this cost, very large VAT payers will be required to make VAT
payments on account for each of the first two months of every quarter.
Very large traders are those who currently make quarterly VAT returns and
payments and whose total VAT liability (including VAT due on imports and on
goods from warehouse) exceeded Pounds 2m over the period covered by their
last four quarterly returns up to and including March 31 1991.
The chancellor previously announced his intention to consult on the original
proposal that those large traders would change from quarterly returns and
payment to monthly returns and payment.
The chancellor has listened carefully to the responses arising from the
consultation process, and has accepted the concerns expressed by businesses
about the cost of changing internal accounting arrangements and the
increased exposure to penalties and default surcharge. He has agreed that
monthly VAT payments on account will be required, instead of monthly returns
and payments, with the first payments on account due in the month of
November, December or January depending on the timing of the VAT returns
cycle for each trader.
Full details of the proposed scheme are in a leaflet which will be sent to
the business representatives previously consulted. Copies of the leaflet are
available from the VAT Central Unit (tel: 0702 366585).
Under the current system for imports, a business completes a Single
Administrative Document and declares its duty and tax liability. VAT is paid
at this time, or, subject to prior approval by Customs and Excise, any duty
due and the VAT may be deferred for up to six weeks.
Under the deferment arrangements the payments due are charged to a Duty
Deferment Account on the 15th day of the month following the date of
importation. A VAT Certificate is provided to importers as evidence of
payment of the tax and this is used to support a claim for input tax
deduction in the normal way. These arrangements will continue after 1993 for
imports from outside the Single Market.
Under the PAS system, using commercial documentation, the importer enters
the 'import VAT' as tax due (output tax) in his business records and claims
any tax due as a deductible expense for his business (input tax). These
figures are declared on the business's normal VAT return.
There will be no need to submit Customs documentation for goods supplied to
a UK business by a business in another EC country nor will the importer need
to pay VAT at the port or airport of entry. There are no changes for imports
from outside the Single Market.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Late payment of business
bills to be deterred - Debt Recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor announced in his Budget a package of measures to help tackle
the problem of late payment experienced by many small firms and to encourage
businesses to adopt the good practice of government departments in making
prompt payment to suppliers.
The government will require large companies to state in their annual report
and accounts how quickly they pay their bills.
Simpler procedures will be introduced for small claims and debt recovery
cases.
Prime contractors of government departments must include a clause in their
sub-contracts committing themselves to pay subcontractors promptly -
ordinarily within 30 days of receipt of a valid invoice.
In addition the Department of Employment will provide up to Pounds 90,000
for three trade associations to run one-year pilot schemes to provide 'late
payment hotlines' for their members.
The chancellor said the government had every sympathy with small companies
who found that their larger debtors were deliberately delaying payment to
boost their own cash flow. Government departments had a good record in
paying their own bills on time and the government hoped the example it had
set would be followed by large companies throughout the private sector.
Company accounts. The government proposes to amend the Companies Act 1985 to
require large companies to state in their annual reports and accounts how
quickly they pay their bills. Subject to the outcome of consultation, the
necessary statutory instrument will be laid later this year. This will
enable prospective suppliers to have an idea of a company's payment
performance and discourage late payment.
Court procedures. Small traders who either sue, or are sued, for debts of
Pounds 1,000 or less will benefit from continuing improvements to the quick,
informal, 'do-it-yourself' small-claims arbitration procedure under which
the loser does not risk being required to pay the winner's legal costs. The
level at which defended debt claims are dealt with under this 'no-costs'
regime has already been doubled from Pounds 500 to Pounds 1,000.
The Lord Chancellor's department has also already consulted on further
proposals (planned to be introduced from July this year) to dispense with
preliminary hearings in all but exceptional cases, so that cases are dealt
with at a single substantive hearing, and changes to court rules to
encourage district judges (formerly county court registrars) to help
unrepresented litigants put their case.
Government contracts. In future, all those successfully negotiating a prime
contract with a government department will be required to commit themselves
by contract to pay their subcontractors promptly. The government expects
that the commitment should ordinarily be to pay the subcontractor within 30
days of receipt of a valid invoice as defined by the contract requirements.
The new procedures will be introduced from April 5, 1992.
Where a prime contractor fails to comply with the provision for making
prompt payment in his subcontract, the subcontractor will have a remedy
through the courts in the normal way.
Where there is evidence that the performance of a prime contractor has been
unsatisfactory for reasons which may include the late payment of a
subcontractor, that will be taken into account by the department in awarding
subsequent contracts.
Late payment hotlines. Trade associations will be invited shortly to tender
to run one-year pilot schemes to provide late-payment support services for
their members in areas where the problem of late payment is thought to be
most serious.
The Department of Employment will provide up to Pounds 90,000 to support
three schemes proposed by trade associations. They will be invited to
suggest what form the late payment support services should take but it is
thought likely that one of the services will be telephone 'hotlines' to give
advice to association members on how to pursue late payers through the
courts.
The usage and effectiveness of the support schemes will be monitored and
experience from the pilots will be made widely available to all trade
associations and other similar small firm support organisations.
Government departments are already required to pay their bills promptly.
Government Accounting, the Treasury's guide to departments on financial and
accounting procedures, requires the timing of payment normally to be
stipulated in contracts and, where there is no such contractual provision or
other understanding or accepted practice governing timing of payment, for
departments to pay within 30 days of receipt of goods or services, or the
presentation of a valid demand for payment, whichever is the later.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Agents' paying and
collecting systems to be simplified - Tax Collection
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor proposes in his Budget to change the way in which UK paying
and collecting agents - mainly banks and stockbrokers - account for the tax
which they deduct from payments of foreign dividends and interest.
Under the proposals, agents will be required to account for the tax within
14 days from the end of the month in which it is deducted. The special
remuneration which agents receive from the Inland Revenue will be
discontinued.
The proposals will introduce a simpler system and will speed up receipt of
the tax by the exchequer. And it will bring the treatment of these agents
more into line with others who have similar statutory obligations.
The changes will apply from 1 October 1992.
At present, paying agents are required to make a return to the Inland
Revenue at, or shortly after, the time of payment showing the details of
payments and the amount of tax deducted. Most collecting agents make returns
on a quarterly basis. When these returns are received, an assessment is
issued, the tax on which is due 30 days after its issue.
Under this system, there can be a considerable delay between tax being
deducted by the agent and it being paid over to the exchequer.
Under the proposed system, paying and collecting agents will be required to
pay to the Inland Revenue the tax they have deducted from foreign dividends
and interest within 14 days of the end of the month in which the dividend or
interest is paid. Payment of the tax will not depend on the issue of an
assessment. Interest will be chargeable if the tax is not paid by the end of
the 14-day period.
The returns which agents make to the Inland Revenue will, as at present for
most collecting agents, continue to be made on a quarterly basis. These will
show the details of all payments made in the quarter, the tax deducted and
the tax which has already been accounted for to the Inland Revenue.
The statutory provision for the payment of remuneration to agents will be
repealed. The present level of these payments is 90p per Pounds 1,000 of
income from which tax is deducted. Payments of this sort are not made to
others with responsibility for deducting and accounting for tax. The change
will result in a public expenditure saving of some Pounds 1.6 million a
year.
The proposals will bring the arrangements for foreign dividends and interest
more into line with other deduction at source arrangements eg large
employers accounting for PAYE.
Tax relief for insolvent deposit-takers: The chancellor proposes to allow
tax relief for expenses and unrelieved trading losses against interest
income received during the compulsory liquidation of companies which were
authorised deposit-takers under the Banking Act 1987.
These companies are unable at present to obtain this relief against the
interest income they receive after their trade has ceased; and the income is
therefore taxed more severely than if the trade had continued. The effect of
this relief will be to increase the amount potentially available to repay
depositors and other creditors.
The relief will apply to chargeable periods ending after today.
Income arising from a trade after it has permanently ceased remains taxable,
but certain expenses incurred can be offset against that income. Relief is
also available for losses incurred before cessation. But some income arising
after cessation, such as interest, is taxed differently and without the
benefit of any deduction for expenses and losses.
Under the proposal, that difference will be removed in the case of companies
which are insolvent and being compulsorily wound up by the Courts, but which
were authorised deposit-takers under the Banking Act within the 12 months
before trading ceased.
The relief will be available against all income which arises after cessation
on the assets of the former business and which would, had trading continued,
have been either a trading receipt, such as interest on loan advances, or
income taxed at source against which trading losses brought forward could
have been set.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Comment): Limits of the new consensus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LAMONT has presented a budget that reflects the new policy consensus, but
possesses a number of clever touches. He has, in the end, bribed the
electorate much less than some hoped and others feared. But the main reason
for his frugality, the UK's rapidly deteriorating fiscal position, should
give all observers pause.
The chancellor has played the ERM game by the book, the result being a
deeper recession than foreseen and a worse fiscal position than the
pessimists feared. All now depends on the reward for this disinflationary
virtue. Without the recovery now forecast by the Treasury, the UK is heading
for a serious fiscal crisis. But, alas for Mr Lamont, even if that recovery
arrives, its benefits may accrue to the opposition.
As recently as November's Autumn Statement, the Treasury forecast growth of
non-oil gross domestic product at minus 2 1/4 per cent in 1991, followed by
plus 2 1/4 per cent in 1992. These figures have now been reduced to minus 2
1/2 per cent and plus  3/4 per cent, respectively. Thereafter, things are
supposed to get better, with growth at 3 per cent in the year to the first
half of 1993 and 3 1/2 per cent thereafter. But this is not the first time
the Treasury has claimed that things would soon improve.
The recession has had one great benefit. Infla-tion has fallen sharply and
will continue to do so. By the end of this year retail price inflation is
expected to be down to 3 3/4 per cent. By 1996-97, the Treasury foresees the
broadest measure of inflation running at Germanic levels of 2 per cent a
year. Along with real GDP growth of 3 1/2 per cent per annum, this would
seem to be the British equivalent of economic nirvana.
Unfortunately, old British problems are likely to experience several
reincarnations before then. With the public sector borrowing requirement
expected to be Pounds 14bn this year (up from the Pounds 10 1/2 bn forecast
in November), the fiscal position is sliding alarmingly.
Next year's PSBR of Pounds 28bn - after the proposed net tax reductions of
only Pounds 1.5bn - is worse than the city consensus. With privatisation
receipts put to one side, the PSBR is forecast to be just under 6 per cent
of GDP in 1992-93. In 1993-94 it will be just as bad, with the improvements
now forecast for subsequent years depending on a sustained period of above
trend economic growth. Even so, the Treasury is no longer forecasting a
return to a zero PSBR within the forecasting horizon.
Should growth prove to be as constrained by ERM membership as some fear, tax
increases are inevitable. That outcome depends on the British consumer, on
the one hand, and the German wage bargainer, on the other. The chancellor
insisted that recovery is dependent on the behaviour of the private sector.
He is right. But the most important private sector is the German and the
institution that will channel its response is the Bundesbank.
Given the fiscal picture, Mr Lamont could do little but be cautious. Even
so, he may not be able to get the interest rate cut he would like. But he
has at least devised changes in the fiscal structure that the Labour Party
cannot readily attack.
Car tax is an anomaly. The chancellor was right to halve it, though still
greater increases in excise duty on petrol would have been an appropriately
green offset. The chancellor's determination to raise excise duties by at
least the rate of inflation - and more for leaded petrol and tobacco - is
also commendable. The Business Expansion Scheme was little more than a
subsidised property play. Its day was past. And the decision to remove the
bias in favour of direct share ownership in PEPs was overdue.
Business hoped for help, which the chancellor decided to give in the form of
further transitional relief on the Uniform Business Rate. Meanwhile, Advance
Corporation Tax remains unmodified, its payers unmollified. But Mr Lam-ont
was right to eliminate the male chauvinism of the married couples allowance
and wise to avoid the politically correct error of introducing a generalised
relief for child care.
The centre piece of the budget, however, is the stealing of Labour's
political clothes. The new 20p lower rate of income tax is what the Labour
party has said it wants, even though it is far from the best way to help the
poor. Should the Labour party commit itself to reversing the reduction, it
will be damaging many of its own supporters - just what Mr Lamont wants. He
presents the new lower rate as an earnest of the intention to move to a new
basic rate of 20p, a point on which Labour will disagree. It is here, on the
choice between Mr Lamont's carefully targeted tax cut and the Labour Party's
proposed expenditure and tax increases that the electoral battle will focus.
This is the Budget of a chancellor constrained by the disinflationary
consensus. Mr Lamont has given the opposition few clear points of attack,
except over the state of economy. Even here the Labour party offers the same
policy. If the budget reflects the new consensus, its economic fruit looks
likely to remain untasty for some time. This budget does nothing to change
that dismal fact.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): 'Qualified rapture' from film
industry - Film Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR WILF STEVENSON, director of the British Film Institute, produced a
suitably theatrical response to yesterday's tax concessions for the British
film industry - 'qualified rapture'.
The main concession from Mr Norman Lamont, who has a reputation as a film
buff, will allow production costs to be written off against tax in three
equal annual tranches after production is complete. At the moment costs can
usually only be written off when a film is released and starts to earn
revenues. Sometimes this is as long as two years after production is
completed.
But after more than two years of intensive lobbying the film industry failed
in its main objective - to persuade the government that the costs of a film
should be written off as soon as they are incurred. This was granted for
pre-production costs such as script writing - a small part of a film's
costs.
'I don't know whether (the change in the Budget) is generous enough to have
much impact,' said Mr Larry Chrisfield, head of entertainment and media at
accountants Ernst &amp; Whinney.
Mr Lamont's estimate of the sums involved as a result of the concessions -
Pounds 5m this year and Pounds 15m in 1993-4 - is, Mr Chrisfield believes,
an indication of the significance of the concession. The government may have
been influenced by a confidential meeting last month between Mr Jack
Valenti, the legendary lobbyist for the US film industry, and Mr Francis
Maude, financial secretary to the Treasury.
Mr John Woodward, chief executive of Pact, the producers association, who
was also at the Maude meeting, yesterday described the changes as quite
helpful.
'I think it's a sign that the government does recognise that there is a
British film industry,' Mr Woodward said.
Last year, according to Pact, 15 totally British films were made with a
budget of Pounds 33.4m. There were also a further 20 British productions,
largely made abroad, costing a total of Pounds 82m.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): End to red channel - Customs Powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITIZENS OF EC member states will no longer be required to pass through red
and green channels at UK frontiers from the beginning of next year, under
limitations to the powers of Customs &amp; Excise unveiled by the Chancellor
yesterday.
The red and green channels, which help Customs officers to detect purchases
of goods currently subject to duty, are being abolished as part of the
process of harmonisation with other EC states in preparation for the
creation of the single European market.
Customs officers will no longer have the automatic right to stop and
question EC citizens who may be carrying goods which are subject to duty,
either in person or at vehicle checkpoints. Limitations will be lifted on
the import of any reasonable quantity of goods such as alcohol, tobacco and
perfume on which duty has been paid.
Individuals from non-EC countries will still be subject to searches and
limitations on the quantity of goods they may bring in to the UK. Customs
officers will still be able to stop people on suspicion of carrying drugs or
other prohibited goods.
'We will be changing from a red and green channel to a green channels with a
red spot,' said a Customs spokesman last night.
Under a transitional arrangement the duty-free industry will be allowed to
maintain shops at frontiers until 1999. There will be limits on the volumes
of goods purchased without payment of duty from these shops.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DUTY on matches and mechanical lighters, which was introduced during the
First World War, will be abolished next year as a result of the falling
yield derived from declining match sales and the increase in smuggling of
lighters.
The Chancellor believed it would be difficult for Customs to collect the tax
after the removal of fiscal frontiers in the EC on January 1 1993. Matches
and lighters are not subject to duty in all EC countries.
In 1990-91 about Pounds 6m duty was raised from matches and Pounds 11m from
lighters. The current rates of duty are 0.6p per box of 40 matches and 50p
per lighter.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Small blow to the City - Tax on
foreign interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHANGE to the way the Revenue collects tax on foreign interest and
dividends paid to UK investors removes a small but in some cases important
cashflow advantage for many stockbrokers and banks.
Given the sharp rise in international investment over recent years, and
consequently the greater flow of dividend and interest income across
borders, yesterday's changes will affect large parts of the City - in all,
600 banks and brokers, according to the Revenue.
In future, any financial institution handling foreign dividend or interest
payments will have to deduct and hand overtax to the Revenue within two
weeks of the end of the month when the remittance was made. That replaces a
three-month gap, which had allowed brokers and banks effectively to support
their cashflow out of taxpayers' money.
Taking away the advantage echoes similar recent changes in the VAT
collection system. And in another parallel to the VAT arrangements, the City
is to take on the role of unpaid tax collector: the Pounds 1.6m that the
Revenue has paid financial institutions to collect the tax until now is to
be stopped.
The changes caused some consternation yesterday among stockbrokers -
particularly since the City is still awaiting the removal of stamp duty,
promised in the Budget two years ago. and a move that would lift one of the
biggest costs on investing in shares. The Chancellor yesterday remained
silent on stamp duty, despite hopes in some quarters that he would abolish
the tax immediately, rather than wait till the introduction of Taurus, the
Stock Exchange's proposed paperless share dealing system. The government's
own difficulties in introducing a legal framework for Taurus have
contributed to the delays in the system, leading to calls from the City for
immediate abolition. That plea fell on deaf ears.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Tax help to creditors - BCCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEPOSITORS in Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which was closed
last summer, will be the main beneficiaries of new tax relief to insolvent
deposit-takers, according to tax advisers.
The relief will benefit all depositors and other creditors of banks and
building societies which have ceased trading and gone into voluntary
liquidation. The timing of the change, though, makes it of particular
relevance to BCCI, by far the largest deposit-taker to fail.
The new relief applies to the interest income earned on loans made by
deposit-takers which have gone into liquidation. Until now, this has been
treated as investment income, and been subjected 33 per cent tax.
Unlike the regular income of other traders in liquidation, it has not been
possible to deduct expenses and earlier trading losses from this interest
income before tax. That difference has now been removed, though the
concession will not apply to income from the proceeds of investments which
have been sold off.
The change should make more money available for distribution by liquidators
of failed deposit-takers. Touche Ross, administrators to BCCI, said
yesterday that it was too early to say what the effect of the change would
be. However, one tax adviser in London said the ability to carry forward
past trading losses to set off against interest income on the bank's loans
should be a significant help to BCCI's creditors.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Basic rate taxpayers are the target -
Guaranteed Growth Bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW National Savings product, to be launched in July, will help the
government meet the planned Pounds 14bn increase in the public sector
borrowing requirement.
Described by the chancellor as a 'guaranteed growth bond', the product will
offer fixed rates of interest guaranteed for only one year at a time.
There will be a penalty, probably in the form of a reduced rate of interest,
if the bond is cashed in earlier.
The time-scale is a departure for National Savings, whose fixed rate
certificates and bonds normally require investors to hold the products for
five years to qualify for the maximum returns.
Interest will be added to the bond annually after tax has been deducted at
the basic rate. The guaranteed rate will be announced later.
The minimum holding will be Pounds 1,000, with a maximum of Pounds 250,000.
National Savings says that those who fall into the new 20 per cent tax band
will have to claim back from the Inland Revenue the 5p in the pound extra
tax paid.
The product is likely only to appeal to basic rate taxpayers. Non-taxpayers
will do better with income and capital bonds while higher rate taxpayers
will be more attracted to National Savings certificates, which are paid free
of income or capital gains tax.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Cautious optimism among small
businesses - Small Firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S notoriously hard-to-please small business community reacted with
uncharacteristic enthusiasm last night to the chancellor's package of small
firms measures.
Small business organisations remained cautious about how some of the changes
will work in practice but were generally pleased about measures to improve
their cash flows, ease the transition to the Uniform Business Rate and
remove the threat of Inheritance Tax.
The decision to abolish the Business Expansion Scheme from the end of 1993
provoked concern, however, that this would create an 'equity gap' for
businesses seeking to raise small amounts of equity finance.
However, in general the Chancellor's selection of small business measures
revealed a sure appreciation of the issues which have been of particular
concern to small firms. Some of the changes will remove long-standing
problems such as inheritance tax while others should remedy complaints
created by more recent tax changes.
The changes represent a finely balanced collection of measures designed to
ease cash flow problems in the short term and to create an easier long-term
climate for the small business.
The decision to remove most family-owned businesses from the inheritance tax
net is expected to provide an important psychological fillip of even greater
value than the Pounds 35m that such businesses will save in tax during the
next two years. British small firms groups have looked enviously at the
strong family-owned business sectors in France and Germany.
'Inheritance tax has been a sword of Damocles over the head of the small
family business,' said Ms Jane Lyon, managing director of Clam-Brummer, a
second generation company making industrial adhesives. 'You can take steps
to avoid the tax but there has always been an element of keeping your
fingers crossed.'
The decision to ease the transition to the Uniform Business Rate also showed
a fine sensitivity towards one of the most pressing issues to concern the
small firms organisations.
They have lobbied ever since the introduction of the UBR for a transitional
regime more sensitive to the needs of smaller businesses.
By ensuring that there is no real increase in the rate next year; speeding
up the reductions for businesses which gain from the new system; and
allowing new tenants to inherit the transitional protection enjoyed by the
previous tenant, the chancellor has met the small firms organisations' three
main objections.
The chancellor's proposed VAT changes will do much to ease the problems of
administering what is probably the small business community's least liked
tax. Allowing more firms to use the cash accounting option will improve
their cash flows at a particularly difficult time. Bringing more small
employers into the system for making quarterly rather than monthly income
tax and national insurance payments will also help cash flows.
However, it was the chancellor's move to ease Customs &amp; Excise's draconian
VAT enforcement powers which was the most widely welcomed VAT change. The
decision to reduce the Serious Misdeclaration Penalty to 15 per cent means
it has been halved during the past two budgets.
Small firms lobby groups remain concerned, however, that their fundamental
objection to the penalty - that it can be applied to simple errors of tax
administration as well as to deliberate attempts to defraud - remains. They
hope for more far-reaching changes from the Customs &amp; Excise's promise of
continuing consultations.
Measures to ease the difficulties small firms face in persuading their large
customers to pay their bills on time also showed that the chancellor has
listened closely to the complaints of the small business lobby groups.
Lobbyists wondered just how many companies would be included in the
definition of 'larger companies' which will be expected to report in their
annual reports just how quickly they pay their suppliers.
For the government to insist that main contractors on government contracts
must pay subcontractors within 30 days means that the government departments
must themselves first meet this deadline.
The decision to abolish the Business Expansion Scheme provoked concern. The
Union of Independent Companies said that another scheme would have to be put
in its place to meet the equity needs of small companies.
The government appeared to be taking an unduly optimistic view of the
venture capital industry, which is generally unable to provide small amounts
of equity, in abolishing the BES.
Inevitably the small business lobbyists' lengthy shopping list of requests
has not been met in full.
There was no reintroduction of 100 per cent first year capital allowances
abolished eight years ago and there were no special corporation tax breaks
for smaller firms.
The plea from the venture capital community for BES-style tax concessions to
be extended to the managers of businesses became impracticable once the
decision to abolish the BES itself had been taken.
Nor was there any response to the rather optimistic plea for the government
to pay small businesses for the work they put into administering VAT.
However, with the exception of these relatively minor blemishes, the
government appears to have done a good job in making up for past neglect of
a sector traditionally containing many of its most fervent supporters.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Income Distribution): Middle-bracket households
win - An analysis by The Institute of Fiscal Studies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE second successive year, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has
produced a Budget whose distributional consequences are markedly different
from most Conservative Budgets of the 1980s. Whereas the Lawson Budgets of
1986, 1987 and 1988 produced cuts in income tax rates which
disproportionately rewarded the richest taxpayers, Mr Lamont seems to have
gone out of his way to show concern for poorer taxpayers, and, in the case
of the Income Support changes, for those too poor to pay any tax at all.
However, as our distributional analysis shows, the picture is a little more
complicated than first impressions might suggest.
The first chart shows the effect of the Budget measures on the disposable
incomes of households of different types. The comparison is with a Budget
which simply maintained the real value of income tax allowances and excise
duties and left tax rates unchanged. This is the usual basis on which
governments conduct their financial planning.
The first clear result is that the vast majority of households have gained
from this year's Budget measures. About four in five households are net
gainers from the changes, and the average gain for the population as a whole
is some Pounds 80 per year (compared simply with an indexed Budget).
However, it also emerges from our analysis that about one in six households
is worse off as a result of the changes. In particular, losses are most
likely to occur among non-working couples and among single people without a
job. A combination of factors produces losses for these groups.
In the first place, the income tax cut is of no present value to those who
are not paying tax, and so the non-working population below pension age
largely missed out in this year's Budget.
Second, and for the second year running, the married couple's tax allowance
was frozen and so during the coming year its real value will again be eroded
by inflation. This change cost all married couples paying tax at the basic
rate about Pounds 20 per year.
Third, some excise duties, principally those on tobacco, leaded petrol and
on motor vehicles, were raised by more than the rate of inflation. Even the
poorest households pay excise duties, and so when these are raised by more
than inflation, they again lose out. For all of these reasons some of the
poorer families of working age found themselves worse off as a result of
yesterday's announcements.
For the retired population the picture is generally much brighter. Retired
taxpayers will gain from the reduced rate of income tax, while married
pensioners, unlike their working age counterparts, did not see their
personal tax allowances cut. Meanwhile, for the poorest pensioners there
were increases in the rates of Income Support which, though not due until
October, have been included in our analysis.
The combined effect of these changes is to leave more than three-quarters of
married pensioners better off, and almost all single pensioners with a real
increase in income. Indeed, it is single pensioners in particular who do
well since they will often be older and poorer; they stand to make full
gains from the increases to Income Support.
Looking at the employed population there are average gains across the board.
The largest gains go to couples where both partners are working since they
are both able to take advantage of the new reduced rate of income tax, and
this explains why their gains are, on average, substantially larger than
those for single earner couples. The gains for multiple family households
(for example those with a married couple and a grown-up child out at work)
are larger still, again reflecting the fact that the more taxpayers there
are in the household, the larger is the gain from the income tax cut.
A second way of analysing the effects of the Budget measures is to consider
their effect on households with different levels of income. In the second
chart, we show the average gain and the proportions gaining and losing at
different income levels. Since our definition of income includes only
earnings and investment incomes it should be noted that most unemployed
families or pensioners will fall within the poorest categories.
A first surprising feature of our analysis by income range is that the only
group to suffer losses in real terms is the very richest. In order to
understand this result it must be remembered that we are comparing what the
chancellor actually did with a 'do nothing' Budget which simply increases
tax thresholds and allowances in line with inflation.
In fact, as far as higher rate taxpayers are concerned, the chancellor did
worse than nothing. Instead, he actually froze the threshold at which higher
rate tax becomes payable. Thus as earnings increase during the coming year,
more people will find themselves paying higher rate tax than would have been
the case if the chancellor had chosen to index this threshold. This is a
real loss to better-off families, and it is somewhat disingenuous to suggest
that no group faces an increase in their direct tax. If the chancellor is
willing to quote figures for the increase in pensioner incomes during the
1980s after allowing for inflation, then should he not also assess the
effects of his own Budget against an indexed base?
It might, however, be argued that higher-rate taxpayers will gain from the
reduced rate band and this is indeed true. The reduced rate band saves the
vast majority of taxpayers 5 per cent of Pounds 2,000, or Pounds 100 a year.
However, the chancellor cut the higher rate threshold by Pounds 1,100 in
real terms. Since every pound taxed at the higher rate rather than the basic
rate costs a higher rate taxpayer 15p, then an allowance cut of Pounds 1,100
costs such taxpayers Pounds 165 per year. This more than offsets the gains
from the reduced rate band.
When we look further down the income distribution we see that the largest
gains are concentrated among those households with incomes in the Pounds
13,000 to Pounds 31,000 range. How does this sit with the chancellor's
statement that the majority of the gains would go to individuals below
average income?
In fact, the two results are consistent. What our charts show is the incomes
of complete households. Thus where two partners are both out at work, their
incomes are aggregated because they are being classified by household
income. We have already seen that it is households where two or more people
are working who gain most from the Budget and this chart is telling us the
same story.
However, Mr Lamont's claim related not to households but to individuals. It
is indeed true that much of the gain from the income tax change will go to
individuals with below average earnings. All our chart says is that such
individuals are not necessarily living in poor households.
At the very lowest income levels, the proportion of losers, though small, is
larger than for the population as a whole. This is primarily due to the
increases in excise duties, and the people involved are typically working
age people not currently in the labour market who do not benefit from the
tax changes. Conversely, the gainers at very low incomes are pensioners
either currently receiving Income Support or brought on to Income Support by
the increased rates announced yesterday.
Taken together, our results seem to suggest that what we have seen is a
Budget which has given benefits primarily to middle-income households with
small numbers of losers at both extremes of the income distribution.
Given the chancellor's expressed concern for those on low pay, this might
seem a surprising result. However, the introduction of a reduced rate band
is in fact not the best way to help low-paid taxpayers. A person with small
amounts of taxable income would far prefer to pay no tax than a reduced rate
of tax. Though this may seem self-evident, the chancellor has eschewed the
most obvious mechanism for bringing this result about, namely the increasing
of personal tax allowances. Indeed, in the case of the married couple's
allowance he has ensured that, compared with an indexed Budget, more low
earners will be paying income tax than would otherwise have been the case.
With regard to the introduction of a reduced rate band, the chancellor
repeated a claim more often heard from the Labour benches that the starting
rate of tax and National Insurance paid by the low paid is too high.
However, what is presumably of most importance to someone on low pay is not
the amount of tax paid on the last pound of additional income, but rather
the average tax rate on the whole of their income. To float people out of
income tax by over-indexing personal allowances reduces their average and
marginal income tax rate to zero. Instead, the chancellor has reduced their
marginal rate to 20 per cent. Surely the former option would receive the
vote of the low-paid who Mr Lamont was seeking to target?
It is a common fallacy to reason that because the vast majority of taxpayers
face a marginal tax rate of 25 per cent, we do not have a progressive income
tax system. The defining characteristic of a progressive tax system is that
as incomes rise the share of income taken in tax also rises. As we have
noted with regard to the low paid, what matters is not the rate on the
marginal pound but the rate on the whole of income. On this criterion, the
UK income tax system is, in fact, strikingly progressive.
The latest Inland Revenue figures suggest that for a taxpayer with taxable
income below Pounds 5,000 per year, about 4 per cent of income went in tax;
for someone with slightly more than average earnings (Pounds 15,000 to
Pounds 20,000), the share of income taken in tax rises to 16 per cent; and
for the highest earners (those with more than Pounds 40,000 per year), the
share of income taken in tax stands at 30 per cent. Thus the UK does indeed
have a progressive tax system, despite the wide basic rate band.
In fact, what makes the UK tax system progressive is not so much the tax
rates themselves but rather the relatively high level of tax-free personal
allowances. For the same cost as introducing a reduced rate band the
chancellor could have increased personal tax allowances by substantially
more than inflation and in doing so could have taken more than 500,000
people out of income tax altogether. Instead, he chose to lower the starting
rate. In terms of overall tax progressivity this was clearly preferable to a
general reduction in the basic rate of tax, but equally clearly inferior to
a substantial increase in tax-free allowances. The low-paid should be giving
only one-and-a-half cheers to Mr Lamont this morning.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Number of share owners down 1.2m - Shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of personal shareholders in the UK has fallen by 1.2m in the past
year, the first decline since the boom in share ownership created by the
privatisations of the 1980s.
Around 9.8m people currently own shares, down from 11m this time last year,
according to the Treasury's annual survey of share ownership, conducted with
ProShare, the wider share ownership group.
The decline has come about in spite of the privatisations in the last 12
months of the electricity generating companies and Scottish electricity
companies, and the sale of a substantial stake in BT. It means the
proportion of adults in the UK owning shares has fallen from 25 per cent
last year to 22 per cent this year.
The fall-off in share ownership has not been caused by a decline in
privatisation holdings. According to the survey, conducted by NOP, 14 per
cent of adults in Britain own privatisation shares, the same proportion as
last year. Similarly, the proportion of adults owning shares in the
companies where they work has also remained stable, at 4 per cent.
At the same time, there is little evidence in the survey that shareholders
are broadening their investment portfolios. The proportion of investors
owning shares in only one company has fallen by just one percentage point to
53 per cent, while those with two shareholdings has also fallen by one
point, to 19 per cent.
On the other hand, those with four shareholdings or more has risen slightly.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Tax move seen as 'gimmick' - Lib Dems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democrats last night dismissed the new 20p income tax rate as a
'gimmick'. But early indications were that its MPs would not oppose many of
the Budget proposals - increasing the likelihood of their implementation if
the general election leads to a hung parliament.
Mr Alan Beith, the party's Treasury spokesman, said the 20p tax rate was a
'cheap electoral trick' which could have been better targetted. Rather than
voting against the proposal, the party may enter the election pledged to
raise the 25p basic rate to 26p to fund the extra Pounds 2bn of education
spending it committed to.
On other measures, the Liberal Democrats have proposed a freeze in the
Uniform Business Rate - although they would cut the level in real terms,
instead of limiting rises to the rate of inflation as announced yesterday.
The party has also campaigned for extra help for small businesses seeking to
recover debts from large companies. It backs reforming the Budget process.
If Liberal Democrats held the balance of power after the election, an
independent central bank and a move to the narrow bands of the Exchange Rate
Mechanism would be set as priorities for an anti-inflation strategy.
Privately some Liberal Democrats believe the Conservatives would be
receptive to such moves.
Labour, though, would agree more with the large-scale investment package the
Liberal Democrats propose. However, the extra Pounds 6bn to the Public
Sector Borrowing Requirement suggested by Mr Beith last week may be revised
downwards because of the larger than expected government PSBR forecast
yesterday.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Loophole on rents to be closed - Inland
Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inland Revenue will gain an additional Pounds 230m in the 1992-94 tax
years by closing a loophole which allows companies to defer tax payments on
rents.
There was speculation in the City that large companies including Hanson,
British Aerospace and Burton would incur substantial additional tax charges
in the next two financial years as a result of the change.
The budget proposal would prevent the practice from today of permitting one
company to claim tax relief on rent paid in arrears, while a connected
company receiving this rental income pays tax on it in the year it is
received.
Since the late 1970s it has become common for a company to transfer all the
properties from its trading businesses into the control of a
specially-created property investment company, according to Mr Derek
Jenkins, a partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte.
It then grants each trading company leases on their properties, with rents
payable at the start of the new tax year. Until now the trading companies
have been able to claim tax relief on the rents in one year, and pay
corporation tax against the rental income the following year.
Most of the gains come in the first year of the creation of the property
company.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Peace plan for Nagorno-Karabakh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATO and its former adver-saries in the Commonwealth of Independent States
and eastern Europe agreed here yesterday on a joint initiative to halt the
bloody fighting in the ethnically mixed Caucasus region of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Under the plan, adopted by the 35-nation Nato Co-operation Council (NACC),
Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the Czechoslovak foreign minister, has been mandated to
undertake a mediation mission to the troubled enclave.
The mission, proposed by Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign
minister, will be prepared by a meeting of senior officials of the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in Prague today.
Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, yesterday warned that fighting
over Nagorno-Karabakh could lead to a full-scale war that might engulf
others, and said Armenia should drop any claims to the territory.
But Iran, another neighbour, is suspicious of Turkey's intentions. A Foreign
Ministry statement quoted by Tehran radio reiterated Iran's offer to mediate
but said that 'the trend of events indicates the involvement of foreign and
seditious elements in the clashes'. This was seen as a reference to Turkey,
which Iranian newspapers have criticised for suggesting US mediation.
The NACC ministers pleaded with the two feuding Caucasus republics to find a
peaceful solution to the conflict.
'We stressed the need for the parties to take concrete actions to step back
from the cycle of violence,' Mr James Baker, US secretary of state said.
Mr Baker warned that 'there will be no victors' if the violence continued.
'There is no glory in leaving widows and orphans to build the democratic,
free-market societies that should be the paramount priority.'
Later, the foreign ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia - at separate news
conferences - made accusations over who was to blame for the conflict in
Nagorno-Karabakh. Both ministers nevertheless said they wanted to solve the
conflict peacefully and that a ceasefire should be monitored by
international peacekeepers.
Mr Gusseinaga Sadykhov, Azerbaijan's foreign minister, welcomed the new CSCE
attempt to solve the crisis.
Mr Dienstbier will be going to Nagorno-Karabakh in his capacity as the
current CSCE president.
His mission is intended to support efforts already undertaken by Russia to
resolve the dispute. The immediate aim is to bring about a ceasefire, an
exchange of prisoners and to set up a corridor through which humanitarian
aid can be channelled.
The agreement by the Council was its first decision following the formal
admission yesterday of 10 new members from the CIS, including Armenia and
Azerbaijan. Russia, the Baltic states and the new central and eastern
European democracies have been members since last year.
Mr Baker and Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, made clear that the
NACC may be called on to play a more direct peacekeeping role in
Nagorno-Karabakh and other areas of conflict in Europe and the territory of
the former Soviet Union.
Though no decision on the despatch of peacekeeping troops to the enclave was
taken yesterday, the possibility of such a move was openly mooted at the
council meeting.
Mr Baker said the NACC should have 'a mutually reinforcing relationship with
the CSCE'. A Dutch proposal that the Council should act as 'an operational
complement' to the CSCE, for example by providing infrastructure facilities
and troops, was discussed at the meeting.
Mr Baker laid particular emphasis in his statement to the Council on the
need to forge ahead with further disarmament measures. The Conventional
Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty should be in force by the time of the CSCE
summit in Helsinki in July, he said.
Implementation of the treaty has been delayed by the dissolution of the
Warsaw Pact alliance and by the break-up of the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to your article 'Most customers find water metering
satisfactory in trials' (March 3): I would point out that there is a problem
with the metering of water if the meter is, as in this district, near the
road, and not in the house.
I had the misfortune that the main from the meter to the house leaked for
some four months and, being buried and invisible, nobody knew. The courtesy
of the South West Water Company excused me from having to pay a large part
of the cost, which would have been more than Pounds 2,000. I would suggest
that serious consideration should be given to mounting water meters in the

   From R M BALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With some 20 years in the shipping industry, I am not aware of any
civilian ship operator who has the budgets available to keep one ship in
harbour and one at sea, let alone who requires three ships in the harbour to
maintain one at sea at all times ('Naval chief backs fourth Trident sub',
March 6).
Ferry companies which operate in all weathers have no reserve ferries in
their peak season and even companies operating vessels at the cutting edge
of technology, Sealink's Wavepiercers for example, do not have spares.
It appears that one or more of the following possibilities applies:
The design of Trident is at fault, resulting in breakdowns.
Management and/or crewing arrangements have not moved with the times.
The decision to contemplate purchase of a fourth Trident at a time of
reduced demand is motivated by factors other than operational.
Perhaps the time has come for the government to contemplate civilian
management of the navy, leaving solely strategy and war to the admirals.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Foreign Affairs: Refugees and wasted revenues - Western
countries are unable to disentangle policy towards asylum seekers and
immigrants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Immigration and asylum policy should, in theory, be quite distinct. The
former is an economic and social issue, the latter a humanitarian one. But
in practice they have got inseparably intertwined, because a liberal or
humane asylum policy is bound to be seen as a loophole in a restrictive
immigration policy. The two can only be maintained side by side if there is
a fair and fast method of distinguishing between voluntary and forced
migrants; and no such method has yet been found.
Fast methods are bound to be arbitrary, as snap judgments have to be made
about situations which may be very complex, by people who may not be
familiar with the language or political background of those whose good faith
they have to assess. Fair methods are likely to be slow, and that means
either detaining asylum applicants for long periods or letting them into the
country provisionally, after which they live for months or years with the
threat of deportation hanging over them. In practice European countries
deport very few asylum applicants once they are in the country, but many are
left in limbo. The unstated policy seems to be to use the difficulties and
indignities of the application process as a deterrent.
All this is very expensive. Industrialised countries spend, according to Ms
Barbara Harrell Bond, director of Oxford University's Refugee Studies
Programme, an estimated Dollars 5bn to Dollars 6bn a year on processing
asylum seekers. She compares this to the funds available to the office of
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for its work around the world,
currently less than Dollars 1bn.
That makes it sound as if it would be more cost-effective for industrialised
countries to slash their expenditure on asylum seekers and give the money
saved to UNHCR. Unfortunately, however, this is not a real alternative.
Clearly there is no chance of eliminating asylum procedures altogether. This
could be done only by deciding either to refuse everybody or to admit
everybody.
Refusing everybody would be contrary to international law, inhumane and
politically unacceptable. Admitting everybody would mean abandoning any
attempt to control immigration. This might just possibly be good economics,
but is no longer remotely feasible politics in any country, even Australia
or the US.
Thus giving more money to UNHCR, however desirable in itself, would
certainly not remove the need for asylum procedures. Nor would it be at all
likely to produce a pro rata reduction in the number of asylum applications
to industrialised countries. As Ms Harrell Bond herself points out, those
who seek asylum in the industrialised world, although a rapidly growing
number, are less than 5 per cent of all forcibly uprooted people. All the
rest remain in the south.
Nor is there any simple correlation between the cost of processing asylum
applications and the number of bona fide applications received. Much of the
money spent is a function not of the actual number of applications, but of
the number of spurious applications to be feared if the machinery for
weeding them out were not in place. In other words, the ostensible cost of
an asylum policy is, in reality, part of the cost of an immigration policy.
It is perhaps unfair to take Ms Harrell Bond to task in this way, because
her remarks were only a preamble to a very interesting argument about what
should be done to tackle the worldwide refugee problem, and she certainly
does not regard it as a simple matter of giving much more money to UNHCR.
Her views were set out in a paper submitted to the UK-Japan 2000 Group,
which held its annual conference last weekend. The group exists to promote
Anglo-Japanese understanding and co-operation, and this year it devoted a
session to international migration.
I had assumed that the discussion would focus on the British experience of
immigration, the problems now raised by population movements in Europe, and
the extent to which Japan faced or might face similar problems. So it was
rather a surprise, though by no means an unpleasant one, to find that the
main paper submitted from the British side was the one by Ms Harrell Bond
entitled 'Refugees and the reformulation of international aid policies: what
can Britain and Japan do?'.
The next surprise was to find that the main targets of her attack were not
western governments, nor yet international business, but UNHCR itself and
the 'non-governmental organisations' (NGOs) - western charities working in
the third world - which in such discussions are usually cast as the good
guys.
Ms Harrell Bond's thesis resembles the criticism which Israel has long made
of Arab states for their handling of the Palestinian refugee problem, and
also the critique that Thatcherism made of the welfare state in Britain.
What she says in substance is that current policies tend to perpetuate
problems by imposing a dependency culture on refugees, forcing them to live
in camps and rely on distribution of emergency food supplies, instead of
encouraging them to use their skills to become self-supporting, and in the
process make a contribution to the economy of the host country.
Her examples of success stories are Cyprus, where 'focusing on the need for
housing and placing an emphasis upon labour-intensive policies, the
government met the humanitarian needs of the refugees and used the situation
as a catalyst for the reconstruction of its economy'; and Nepal, where
Tibetan refugees were allowed to use their carpet-making skills, and were
paid a wage rather than receiving food aid, with the result that '30 years
on, having created employment for thousands of others, carpet making is the
largest manufacturing industry in Nepal with foreign currency earnings of
Dollars 50m annually'.
These examples are contrasted with the 'normal' approach, in which host
governments create special offices to deal with the needs of refugees. 'The
maintenance of these offices depends on the continued existence of visible
concentrations of people who attract funds earmarked for refugees. The
result has been the perpetuation of a population labelled refugees, left
living in limbo, sometimes behind barbed wire, and dependent for their
survival on relief. Such bureaucratic interests were demonstrated on the day
the Afghanistan peace accord was signed; several hundred Pakistani
government employees petitioned their parliament, demanding to know what
would happen to their employment if the refugees went home.'
Ms Harrell Bond proposes that in future governments adopt a 'development'
rather than a 'relief' approach. Apart from the vested interests of NGOs and
local bureaucrats, and the ingrained habits of UNHCR, this argument will
often run into the objection that it is politically defeatist, since it
assumes the refugees have to be semi-permanently integrated into the host
country's economy, whereas their own most ardent wish is usually to be able
to return in safety to their original homes.
But all too many examples show that keeping refugees in camps is no
guarantee that their political problem will be solved; and on the whole they
are less resented when they mingle with the rest of the population, paying
their own way, than when they are kept as a separate, embittered community
with nothing to occupy them but guerrilla training and irredentist politics.
The Cyprus/Nepal approach may not be a universal panacea, but it could be
tried in many more places than it has been.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From I J HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest your article 'Silent enemy poised for attack'
(March 5) which discussed the potential threat that US warehouse clubs pose
to UK retailers, and agree with much of your argument.
While not wishing to be dismissive of a formula that has been so successful
in the US, it seems appropriate to put the threat into context from the
point of view of the UK supermarket retailer.
In a typical US warehouse club, about 40-50 per cent of sales are in product
categories offered by a large UK supermarket.
Of this, US market research suggests that only 35-40 per cent is sold to the
general public, while the rest is sold on a wholesale basis to small
retailers and caterers.
Assuming that a UK warehouse club had a sales pattern similar to that in the
US, for every Pounds 1m of sales made by the warehouse club store about
Pounds 200,000 could be at the expense of the supermarkets.
In the US, warehouse clubs currently have sales of about Dollars 1m (Pounds
600,000) per week per store. Even if they were to increase this to Pounds 1m
in the UK, the total impact that each new warehouse club could have on local
food retailers would be less than half that which is currently experienced
from a new superstore.
Your article states that Goldman Sachs sees scope for only 30 warehouse
clubs in the UK, with total sales of Pounds 2bn, giving a rather ambitious
Pounds 1.3m per store per week. To put this into perspective, it implies
that warehouse clubs will achieve a market share of only about one half of
one per cent of the market in which food retailers such as Sainsbury's
operate.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Letter: Distress of Maxwell pensions episode has given rise
to an unexpected and beneficial side effect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NORMAN FREETHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Leaving aside the depredations perpetrated by the late Mr Robert
Maxwell on his pensioners, his untimely demise has done more to advertise
the merits of pension schemes than any less tragic event or advertising
campaign might have done. As they say, it's an ill wind. . .
Public opinion, like stockmarkets, always overreacts. Understandable, then,
are the proposals attributed to MPs and outlined last week ('Pension fund
trustees face stiff rules', March 4). These advocated sweeping changes in
pension law, that trustees should to be subject to the same strict rules as
company directors, the remit of the Occupational Pensions Board should be
substantially extended, and more. In the main, these are 'stable door'
measures.
Frauds with pension funds are rare because in the main the legal system has
worked well.
Mr Maxwell contrived to control the company, its pension fund, and the
in-house investment manager, inhibiting any employee who valued his job from
speaking against him. That argues not so much against the system as in
favour of ingenuity of the individual. The best way to frustrate another
budding Maxwell is to aim in advance at preventing such a specific set of
circumstances arising.
There is much to be said for pension funds being legally bound to have an
independent trustee responsible to the authorities, with powers to act in
advance of any suspicious event. Indeed, a prototype already exists in the
form of pensioner trustees, a mandatory requirement for controlling
directors' own self-administered pension schemes, answerable to the Inland
Revenue directly and included in a register maintained by them.
For larger pension schemes a similar register of independent trustees could
be kept, maintained perhaps by the Occupational Pensions Board to whom the
Independent Trustee is made accountable. The OPB could be obliged to freeze
the assets of any pension fund immediately, as soon as an independent
trustee, suspicious of what is going on, requires them to do so.
I suggest this approach is likely to be more effective and infinitely less
expensive than the suggestions for increased control currently being
promoted by the media (and, we are now told, by parliament), which are
likely to be no more effective than Imro apparently was.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Personal View: Brussels should be brave over Yugoslavia
dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ZAMETICA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent events in Sarajevo have demonstrated only too sharply that Yugoslavia
is far from pacified. It is still possible, even likely, that
Bosnia-Herzegovina will collapse into chaos and violence, resulting in a
complex territorial fragmentation along ethnic and religious lines. The
analogy of Lebanon, so often cited during the Yugoslav conflict, would
unfortunately be appropriate.
The wider and immediate implication of any conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina is
that probably it would postpone the deployment of UN peacekeeping troops in
Croatia. This in turn could lead to a renewed round of fighting between
Serbs and Croats. The government in the Croatian capital of Zagreb has in
any case never been happy about the arrival of the UN, fearing that the
Serbian enclaves could, through Serbian manipulation on the international
scene, remain indefinitely outside Croatian sovereignty. The most recent
opinion polls from Croatia indicate that the majority of Croats anticipate
precisely such an outcome. Another war in Croatia would thus constitute not
an extension of diplomacy, but its prevention. Then what?
The problems do not stop there. With the exception of Slovenia, all the
perplexing, threatening elements in the Yugoslav quandary are still in
place: apart from the unresolved status of the Serbs of Croatia, there is
the constitutional issue about the political balance between Moslems, Serbs
and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina; the separatist Moslem region of Sandzak in
Serbia, next to Bosnia-Herzegovina; the unruly province of Kosovo, with its
2m ethnic Albanians in Macedonia; the Serbian-Macedonian border issue; the
increasingly vocal Hungarian minority in Vojvodina, northern Serbia.
There are also at least a dozen more esoteric issues and two big ones: the
desperate economic situation in all six Yugoslav republics, and the growing
likelihood of a civil war in Serbia itself between the left and right. Even
if the Croatia problem is resolved, the rest of the country will still keep
the international community preoccupied for some time.
Yet the international community has not even begun to address the central
question in Yugoslavia: what is a minority and what is a nation? For this
has been at the very heart of the manifold Yugoslav crisis. The Serbs of
Croatia see themselves as a nation, not a minority. They invoked the
principle of self-determination which clashed with the principle of the
sovereignty of the (Croatian) state. The ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
similarly argue that they are not a minority, as do the Moslems of Sandzak.
In Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serbs do not wish to become a minority in an
independent, Moslem-dominated state. But the Moslems there have no desire to
become a minority in a rump Yugoslavia. Everybody wants self-determination.
But who is entitled to it?
The EC, which rapidly took over the management of the conflict in Yugoslavia
from the hopelessly ill-equipped Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe (and now probably wishes it had not done so), deliberately steered
clear of this political minefield. Last November the Republic of Serbia sent
a carefully formulated question to Lord Carrington, the chairman of the
EC-sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia: 'Who can be the subject of the
right to self-determination from the standpoint of international public law
 -a nation or a federal unit; is the right to self-determination a
subjective collective right or the right of a territory?'
The question, of course, covered only Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and it
was designed to advance Serbian objectives. But it was nevertheless, in the
Yugoslav context, exactly the right question to ask because it begged the
nation-minority definition.
Lord Carrington passed on the Serbian inquiry to the arbitration commission
attached to the peace conference, but the latter received an altered version
of the same question: 'Does the Serbian population in Croatia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina, as one of the constituent peoples of Yugoslavia, have
the right to self-determination?' Mr Robert Badinter, the French chairman of
the arbitration commission, considered even this far too tricky and
sidestepped the whole matter by replying that the Serbs in Croatia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina were under international law entitled to protection as
minorities. If everybody claims nationhood, the safest course is to declare
everybody a minority.
The EC, in its wisdom, went on to extend diplomatic recognition to Croatia,
which only increased the resolve of the Serbs in that republic to resist the
status of a minority and secede. The fact that the ceasefire held at the
time of the recognition had nothing to do with the recognition itself: the
ceasefire held, and still does, because Serbia knew only too well that the
presence of UN troops would deny the exercise of Croatian sovereignty in the
Serbian enclaves and perhaps, in the long term, detach them altogether. The
whole issue of recognition was, at any rate, badly mismanaged by the EC,
which eventually succumbed to German pressure, itself a result of domestic
opinion driven by sentiment.
How will the EC cope with a battery of unresolved problems elsewhere in
Yugoslavia? Clearly, it is not interested in, and fears to pontificate on,
the implications of self-determination - it is much easier to sound
righteous and say that the internal frontiers of Yugoslavia are inviolable
and can only be changed by agreement, not force.
But force has been used, and it will probably be used again. Unwittingly,
the EC has now, for example, committed itself to a status quo in Kosovo. If
the Serbs of Croatia are a minority, and if the principle of the
inviolability of the frontiers is to be respected, then the ethnic Albanians
are also a minority and they too should stay where they are, as should the
Moslems of Sandzak and all three nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This
assumes, of course, that these people will be happy to observe the laws laid
down by the EC.
The EC did not, except in Slovenia, recognise reality. It dropped the hot
potato of self-determination in favour of Tito's frontiers within
Yugoslavia. It is just possible that those frontiers will be his only
lasting legacy. But it does not seem likely or even desirable. If and when
the EC is confronted by a renewed cycle of violence in Yugoslavia, it may

Sir, In 1901, Japan was described by a foreign observer as 'the land of
approximate time'. Another writer noted that in 1907 'their modern trains do
well if they maintain an average of 20 mph over a short distance'. This is
the country of today's bullet trains, where commuter and long-distance
trains can be relied on to depart on time, almost to the second. British
Rail, take heart] The past, or even the present, need not be an indicator of
the future.

THE END OF HISTORY AND THE LAST MAN
By Francis Fukuyama
Hamish Hamilton, Pounds 20
Businessmen proverbially do not have time to read books. To gratify them,
Francis Fukuyama announced three years ago that history had ended - in a
short journal article. He was then an unknown US State Department official.
Yet the collapse of communism gave the argument a journalistic appeal, and
that bald statement, cased in no more than the outline of an argument,
attracted international attention.
Fukuyama has now expanded the end of history to book length. But you can
stick to the article. The argument is little advanced - just 300 pages
longer, padded out with Fukuyama's musings on a future without history and
his debts to Plato and Hegel - or more precisely, the interpretation of
Hegel by Alexandre Kojeve, an inter-war French-Russian philosopher.
The argument is simple enough. Events will continue to happen; in that
sense, history has a future. But as a struggle between rival ideas on how to
organise society, economy and government, the age-long debate is over.
Western-style capitalist, liberal democracy has swept all before it, whether
marxism and communism on the left, or theocracy and authoritarianism on the
right.
Multi-party democracies, the rule of law and bills of rights may not yet be
universal, but ignore Islamic fundamentalism and the like: 'liberal
democracy remains the only coherent political aspiration that spans
different regions and cultures across the globe'.
All of which is underpinned by an appeal to Hegel's 'cunning of reason': the
German philosopher's dialectic which supposes that history is proceeding
through a continual process of conflict on the road to human freedom, with
each bout of conflict resulting in a less contradictory system - leading,
ultimately, to the perfect regime. It is universal history - 'nothing other
than man's progressive rise to full rationality, and to a self-conscious
awareness of how that rationality expresses itself in liberal
self-government'.
In case all that sounds a bit high-flown to our businessman, Fukuyama
includes a solitary table. It lists 'liberal democracies worldwide' at
intervals from 1790 (when there were three) to 1900 (13), 1960 (36), ending
in 1990, when the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the eastern bloc, plus
less dramatic events in South America, took the figure to 61. Thus is the
onward march of the ballot box plotted, and liberal democracy shown to have
broken out of its original beachheads of western Europe and North America,
spreading around the globe.
Leaving Hegel to one side, the table alone gives pause enough for
questioning Fukuyama's universal history. In the first place, it features
only two countries with an unbroken 'liberal democratic' record going back
two centuries - not an unduly exacting test of the ability of the species to
dominate the next few thousand years. Those two are Switzerland and the US.
Go back even to 1900, and the number rises to a mere five. Fukuyama's powers
of extrapolation are impressive: plot his more recent numbers on a graph,
and North Korea, Iraq, even China, must have liberal democracy around the
corner.
But what, exactly, are they about to confront? Examine Fukuyama's list a bit
more closely. In the 1990 column, the US, Britain, Germany and France are
closely followed by Romania, South Korea, Honduras and Singapore. If all
those are 'liberal democracies', then liberalism and democracy are fairly
elastic beasts. Yet Fukuyama treats the two as if they were stock animals:
either you are one, or you are not, and if you are, then the age of
political conflict is over - unless you relapse, a possibility that he
allows for but never properly explains.
If only liberal democracies came so pre-packaged and conflict-free. In
reality, conflict is as endemic within many as it is absent from a few of
those regimes which should be warming to the democratic dawn. Democracies
evolve and degenerate; they can be overthrown; they are under constant
stress - not only from left, right and nationalists across the spectrum, but
from environmental pressures which could prove as destabilising as the first
three.
Moreover, democracies take such a myriad of forms, with such profound
differences, that to characterise them as a single type of polity is about
as meaningful as to throw all systems of supernatural belief in the box
'religion'. Yet Fukuyama rarely penetrates beneath such airy
generalisations. 'Democracy can never enter through the back door,' he tells
us: 'at a certain point, it must arise out of a deliberate political
decision to establish democracy'. Try that on a serious British historian.
Fukuyama does, at least, tackle some of those countries which are not
remotely near his 'liberal democracy' box. In the west, religious
fundamentalism and nationalism have often been catalysts for democracy; so
he is confident they will prove so elsewhere. Perhaps; perhaps not. It would
be nice to think so - so buy this book for that rainy day when business is
bad and you need reassuring that capitalism, democracy and liberalism are
indeed forever.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Leading Article: A policy for dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1992 dividend declaration season was always going to be difficult for UK
shareholders. Big names such as Vickers, Royal Insurance, Lonrho and Midland
Bank have already reduced their payouts to shareholders, often sharply. But
just as remarkable is the fact that the likes of Barclays Bank, Commercial
Union and Rolls-Royce have maintained, or even slightly increased, their
dividends even though they have had to dip substantially into reserves.
Overall, the response of dividends to the recession has been slow. In 1991,
dividends in aggregate increased by about 6 per cent while earnings fell by
10 per cent or more. As a result, average dividend cover has dropped to 1.8,
which is significantly less than in the previous recession at the beginning
of the 1980s.
The risk is that British companies will struggle unduly to maintain their
payments, in ways which cause permanent financial damage. It is different in
most other countries: in Germany, for example, dividends are moved up and
down with much greater flexibility, while in Japan the level of payout is
far lower.
There are several historical reasons for the propensity to pay high
dividends in the UK. The imputation tax system introduced in the 1970s was
designed to be neutral as between profit retention and distribution,
eliminating the double taxation of dividends which still applies in the US.
At the same time, persistent inflation has encouraged institutions and
private investors alike to seek a high and rising income from equity
portfolios, this being seen as safer than investing in fixed income bonds.
New twist
The increasing prominence of gross investors such as pension funds, and more
recently private investors with personal equity plans, has added a new twist
to this. Because such investors can claim back the 25 per cent tax on
dividends, the overall tax borne by a company and its shareholders taken
together in such cases is only 10 2/3 per cent on dividends compared with 33
per cent on retained profits.
These sums do not make sense when dividends are uncovered and tax reserves
have run out. But there is strong pressure on companies to keep paying out
as long as possible, with the assurance that they will be able to call on
shareholders later through rights issues to repair any damage to their
balance sheets.
Last week, Rolls-Royce justified its decision to maintain the dividend by
saying it reflected the long-term view that it took of its business. But
this is not the traditional view of equity finance. The theory has been that
shareholders accept much of the risk that supports the ability of companies
to operate in volatile markets. If companies bear the risk themselves, and
are prevailed upon to keep paying out unchanged dividends even in a
recession, then the actual businesses may be endangered.
Short cycle
Within a short business cycle this may not matter very much. A profits
recovery will soon restore the financial balance of a company. But the fear
must be that in an extended downturn lasting several years, the adjustment
of dividends to financial reality might be dangerously slow.
In the longer term, the structure of corporation tax may need to be
re-examined, if it seems that far from being neutral, it involves a bias
towards distribution. In an increasingly international market place, it
would be unfortunate for British companies to suffer calls on their cash
flow that do not exist in major competitor countries.
For the time being, public companies in the UK must keep their dividend
policies under close review. It would make sense for them to develop and
publicise long-term dividend policies which would be applied during the
recovery as well as the downturn. All too often, dividends have appeared to
be decided in an obscure way, largely on the passive basis of market
expectations. It is about time that companies, albeit after discussions with
their shareholders, took their own individual decisions about dividends.

FT  11 MAR 92 / All eyes on the prize: FT writers on the race to stage the
2000 Olympics

SIMONIAN

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, SYDNEY, BERLIN, MANCHESTER, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
For four international cities limbering up in the race to stage the 2000
Olympic games, the coming marathon will be a test of organisation as well as
of endurance, with much gold awaiting the winner. The International Olympic
Committee will decide the venue in September next year. Already, the four
contestants - Berlin, Manchester, Sydney and Milan - are moving into the
starting blocks.
Beijing has also put in a bid. But, hampered by memories of the 1989
Tiananmen Square massacre, it is already regarded as an also-ran.
The cities are gearing up for a widespread marketing effort. There are
intriguing national differences in the styles of their campaigns. Berlin's
candidature is designed to symbolise the new face of a reunited Germany. Mr
Heiner Giersberg, spokesman of the Berlin 2000 Olympic games office, calls
the proposal 'Chancellor Kohl's personal baby'.
Manchester is supported by lthe dashing figure of the Duke of Westminster,
Britain's richest landowner, who heads the city's Olympic committee. He runs
his Grosvenor Estates land and property empire from neighbouring Cheshire.
With an eye on the general election and the number of marginal
constituencies in north-west England, Mr John Major, the sports-loving prime
minister, has given the Mancunian initiative his personal backing - as well
as a large infusion of government money.
Sydney, which hopes to bring the Olympics to the southern hemisphere for the
first time since the Melbourne games in 1956, is banking on its scenic
setting as well as its well-established facilities. Yachting in Sydney
Harbour, in sight of the Harbour Bridge and Opera House, would be one of the
most spectacular of all Olympic events.
According to Mr Rod McGeoch, chief executive of Sydney Olympic 2000, the
private company running the bid, ambiance is vital. 'I don't think you can
hope to win the Olympic games unless you can demonstrate that the athletes
will have an excellent time.'
True to form in a country where the turf for the 1990 World Cup was not laid
until days before the soccer started, Milan is taking a more languid
approach. Italy's commercial and financial capital is stressing its
reputation as an international business centre and its independence from
Rome. Experience with the World Cup is likely to be one of the few strong
cards in Milan's hand. Despite all the tantrums about unfinished stadiums
and incomplete roads, 'Italia 90' went remarkably smoothly.
'We produced a fabulous stadium,' says Mr Roberto Caputo, the city
councillor for sport, whose department is responsible for the Olympic
project. He adds, a little lamely: 'We have a strong sporting tradition,
with two famous football teams.'
Selling cities as Olympic capitals involves large financial outlays. In
Australia, Mr McGeoch, a prominent Sydney lawyer and amateur sportsman, is
being paid more than ADollars 150,000 a year (Pounds 65,000) to run the bid,
on which planning started in December 1990. Olympic 2000 has a budget of
ADollars 20m, underwritten by the state government of New South Wales.
Sydney's backers believe the city's biggest drawback is Australia's
geographic position, which would make it expensive to reach, particularly
for competitors from Europe and large parts of the Third World. Sydney is in
a time zone where Europeans would have to stay up all night to watch events
live on television. But morning events would be prime-time evening viewing
in the US, which accounts for 70 per cent of television revenue for the
games.
Olympic 2000 says the games would generate about ADollars 1.1bn (Pounds
470m) in ticket sales, licensing and other revenue, compared with expenses
of about ADollars 1bn. Any shortfall would be covered by the state
government, which believes the Olympics would create 27,000 construction
projects, and generate economic activity worth up to ADollars 10bn.
The Berliners, meanwhile, are putting forward significantly larger figures
for their city's potential outlays. Compared with Sydney, there is also more
money attached to the job of chief Olympic promoter. Mr Axel Nawrocki, the
head of Berlin's Olympic games office, was hired from the Treuhand
privatisation agency on an annual salary of DM360,000 (Pounds 125,000).
The Olympics proposal links the two halves of the city. The decision to seek
the prize was one of the first moves by the previously separate city
administrations of East and West Berlin not long after the wall fell in
November 1989. Berlin's backers believe that the Olympics would cost roughly
DM2bn and earn DM4bn. For Berlin, one of the largest expenses will be the
Olympia Express, an 18km-long rapid transit system costing an estimated
DM400m and linking the Olympic sites at Lake Rummelsburg in east Berlin with
the Olympic village at Ruhleben in west Berlin. It will run parallel to the
S-Bahn overground railway, and will be used after the games, limiting the
cost to the organisers.
Like Berlin, Manchester is using its campaign to stress the city's quest for
renewal after a period of fraught recent history. The driving force behind
the Mancunian campaign is Mr Bob Scott, the Somerset-born dynamo behind the
city's commercial theatre revival in the past 10 years. Mr Scott says that,
if Manchester is to swing the games its way, the IOC will want to see 'deeds
not dreams'.
A Manchester Olympics would cost about Pounds 1bn, says Mr Scott, of which a
third would come from the government. Earlier this month Whitehall committed
an overall Pounds 55m to help. Most of it is earmarked for building an
indoor arena near Manchester's city-centre Victoria Station and a velodrome
in east Manchester, as well as for clearing the site where the Pounds 170m
Olympic stadium is planned.
Milan estimates a cheaper price tag of about L1,500bn (Pounds 695m). 'The
bulk' of this will have to come from outside, says Mr Caputo. He is looking
for commercial sponsorship, not for subsidies from the Italian government.
Milan is stressing the importance of cutting costs, and of limiting the
environmental impact of the new facilities. 'The priority is not to become
submerged in a sea of cement nor to inundate the city with more traffic,' Mr
Caputo says.
Milan's qualms over construction underline that an important factor
determining the choice of Olympic venue will be the efficiency of planning.
A key element behind Berlin's proposal is that only four sports halls need
to be built, all in east Berlin. The largest multi-purpose Berlin sporting
facility, Olympia Hall, will have a capacity of 15,000 and is to be financed
by private investors at about DM1.1bn-DM1.6bn. Sydney's backers say up to 70
per cent of the sporting facilities will be in place by the time the IOC
votes in September 1993. The government has advanced ADollars 300m to
finance an aquatic centre and two athletics stadiums. The most costly
element in Manchester's Pounds 1bn total, meanwhile, would be the Pounds
400m Olympic village, which would be used as housing afterwards.
As they prepare to make their decision, IOC officials will not simply be
besieged with plans for new facilities; they will also see some
infrastructure of a more traditional variety. Berlin's stadium built for the
1936 games is to be refurbished and used for the opening ceremonies and
other events. Manchester will show off Lancashire's Old Trafford cricket
ground, where baseball would be staged.
As far as lobbying is concerned, Australia's, at least, look likely to be
spartan. Sydney's Mr McGeoch rules out the ritzy public relations used by
past contenders. 'I have never taken anybody to lunch to get their business.
I want to be able to say to the IOC: 'Come to us and you will get the
Olympic ideal.''
The cities have 18 months to show they can satisfy that tradition. The
contest is under way to capture the Olympian mood of the millennium.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Free trade for the Americas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATING a free trade agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada was
never going to be easy. Concluding one at a time of economic recession in
two of the countries involved and impending presidential elections in one of
them is likely to be very difficult indeed.
Mr Brian Mulroney, the Canadian prime minister, brought his worries into the
open a few days ago. In an interview with the FT, he said he doubted whether
the US Congress would ratify the pact before this November's elections. His
concerns are far from theoretical. Protectionist sentiment in general and
special interest lobbying in particular are raising questions over
Washington's commitment to the negotiations. More to the point, the existing
free trade agreement between Canada and the US, negotiated four years ago,
is itself coming under a shadow - thanks to moves by the US administration
against Canadian exports.
Two weeks ago, the US Customs Service ruled that Honda cars assembled in
Ontario fail to meet the 50 per cent North American-content threshold
required for duty-free access to the US under the FTA. Then last Friday, the
commerce department slapped a 14.5 per cent countervailing duty on allegedly
subsidised Canadian lumber. Since these are Canada's two biggest exports to
the US in a trade that amounts to CDollars 200bn, it is scarcely surprising
that Ottawa suspects Washington's motives, or that some Canadians favour
pulling out of the agreement completely.
Warning signal
Canada will probably do no such thing. But since the Canada-US agreement is
supposed to provide the framework for the more ambitious Nafta, the current
dispute amounts to a warning for all the governments involved.
The US action against Canadian-made Honda Civics certainly seems arbitrary.
It has taken the US customs service three years to issue guidelines on what
counts as local content, whereas Canada published guidelines in 1988.
Defining local content is a fraught business, but it is hard to escape the
conclusion that the US administration is pandering to protectionist pressure
from domestic carmakers. It is a similar story in the case of lumber.
All this is regrettable, but it is not a reason for the Canadians to
despair. On the contrary, they should be using the current Nafta
negotiations to eliminate the shortcomings in their existing agreement.
Mexico's President Salinas, for his part, would do well to take note of
Ottawa's difficulties as he forces the pace towards an early Nafta
agreement. He will need all the skill he can muster to resist US negotiating
pressure; at worst he could find himself negotiating a bilateral deal with
the US on unfavourable terms.
Political risks
Free trade does entail political risks for all three governments. In Canada
in particular the public blames a two-year recession on the existing FTA and
Mr Mulroney, who faces elections next year, is currently perhaps the most
unpopular leader in the democratic world.
Yet Nafta would have a beneficial overall effect on all three economies. For
the US, it would give exports a much-needed fillip. One recent study
predicted net gains in US-Mexico trade of Dollars 24bn a year by 1995, with
more than 600,000 jobs created in Mexico and 130,000 in the US.
Significant obstacles remain to a deal. After two months of intensive
negotiation disagreements persist over the pace of tariff reduction, rules
of origin, banking services, trade in farm products, and oil. To these must
be added pressure on President Bush to make special provision wherever there
are job losses, and on the migration of 'dirty industry' to Mexico.
None of these problems should be insuperable, however. For Mr Bush, far from
causing political trouble, an early Nafta agreement might provide a
much-needed pre-election coup. But that means dealing fairly with his
northern neighbour as well as his southern one.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Arts: I vespri siciliani - Opera De Nice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since Italy is not far down the road, the region only ceded to France in
1860, Nice may claim justification for doing in the Italian translation
Verdi's first opera written wholly for Paris. A retrograde step, yet any
competent staging of Les Vepres siciliennes deserves attention. If it does
not have the variety and epic sweep of the succeeding middle-period operas
the score, with its electric energy, taut wires and cold steel, has a
special fascination.
This production by Bruno Stefano was based on 'an original idea' by
Jean-Claude Auvray. Presumably this idea was to set the action not in the
13th century Palermo but in the fascist era with risorgimento undertones -
Procida arrives from his journey wearing a long black cloak, carrying a
leather holdall; the Duchess Elena first appears in a short skirt, but her
wedding dress is based on the one worn by Sophie Cruvelli, who sang the role
at the premiere in 1855. Since the librettist Scribe's version of history
was cock-eyed, this need not matter much.
What did matter was that Hubert Monloup's sets and costumes, initially
pleasing but trivialised by hints of mortality given by marble memorials,
graveyard crosses and wreaths, made a cumulatively flimsy effect. Too
parochial, not the shocks rippling outward into the world as they did after
the historical event, but a local affair of a kind familiar in Sicily. Even
so, little was implied of Palermo's oppressive combination of splendours and
miseries.
The musical side under Christian Badea was commendable for a repertory
production scheduled only for three performances - which means that there
wasn't quite the tinder-dry crackling edge the music needs in the ensembles.
The local chorus was augmented by a choir from Belgrade University. It was a
pleasure to hear many unfamiliar voices. For pure vocalism, pride of place
must go to the very talented young Chinese bass Dong-Jian Gong, who sang
Procida with engaging ease. That he conveyed little more than cardboard
patriotism was at least partly Scribe's fault for flattening out the
character. The lovers were American. Frances Ginsberg as Elena phrased
musically and warmly: the top of the voice was bright but lower down turned
to reediness. The wedding bolero curdled. As Arrigo Allan Glassman displayed
a glowing, resonant tenor.
The most satisfying portrait came from the French baritone Rene Massis in
the rewarding role of Guy de Montfort, the Governor of Sicily who discovers
that the insurgent Arrigo is his son. With his French timbre, not obviously
a heroic Verdi baritone, his moulding of the long lines was as eloquent as
it was skilful. In spite of his slight build Massis commanded the stage with
effective, economical movements.
It is the fate of minor characters in many Verdi operas to remain
confusingly anonymous figures,but on this occasion one stood out for his
vigorous projection - Christophe Fel, strong and clear as Robert, the
drunken French soldier whose insulting behaviour to Elena sets the train of
events in motion.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Arts: Converts, cricket, comedy and soap - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It took almost half the opening episode of Channel 4's Food File to work out
why this new series, supposedly about diet, sounded so familiar: it was a
religious programme. Now that real religion in this country has become a
marginal affair (today's happy-clappy stuff seems to have little to do with
faith and much to do with the universal need of a proportion of mankind for
the rhythmical satisfaction of what anthropologists call 'dance-and-drum')
all sorts of single issue taboos are filling the vacuum. They tend to be
linked to one or other of the seven deadly sins. The clean-up-TV campaign
always used the phrase 'sex-and-violence' but actually focused primarily on
sex or, to use the sds term, lust.
Now Food File is going for gluttony as the way of scaring us into being
good. In the opening programme sermons were delivered by those unto whom the
way, the truth, and the life have been revealed, and they are offering to
lead us into the paths of righteousness. Once again bread and wine loom
large, provided they are respectively very hard and in rather small
quantities, but it turns out that the stuff which fills the holy grail is .
. . virgin olive oil. What seems to have happened is that a number of young
people, represented by presenter Drew Smith, have just come across the fact,
well known for the past half century, that some aspects of the southern
Italian diet appear to promote good health. With the usual zeal of youthful
converts they now want the entire British population to change its eating
habits to fit in with this revelation. They are not going so far as to
compare life expectancy in Britain and southern Italy, since that might ruin
the entire series, but they are busy trying to convert the happy Dutton
family and make them good.
The cricket World Cup may be helping to sell satellite dishes, but it is
doubtful whether it is improving the image either of the game or of BSkyB.
In cricket, unlike soccer, say, or rugby, there is no difficulty in telling
the two teams apart: the ones with the bats are on one side and everybody
else is on the other. So it is a mystery why anyone thought it was necessary
for cricketers to wear pierrot pyjamas in vivid colours. All-white clothing
looks beautiful against a green pitch whereas canary yellow or sky blue with
striped highlights looks garish and vulgar; sometimes literally more like a
circus than cricket. As for Sky's reputation, they have surely done
themselves a bad turn by repaying the BBC's willingness to sell edited
highlights of Wimbledon with a refusal to sell edited highlights of this
event, thus ensuring deep resentment among those viewers (still a large
majority of the population) who don't have dishes. There have been early day
motions condemning Sky's policy from both Labour and Conservative
politicians, and MPs of all parties are now talking about the need for a
list of protected events which could not be monopolised by a single
broadcaster.
*****
On the other hand Sky's decision to screen Australia's new, explicitly sexy
soap opera Chances, and America's new explicitly sexy dating game Studs,
will probably help sell even more dishes. The clean-up people may make a lot
of noise but there is no mistaking the fact that sex raises your ratings.
Neither of these series could be called X-rated, but Studs goes well beyond
the coyness and euphemism of Blind Date so that the men may be asked to
guess 'Which of you did the ladies say would be most likely to make love in
the back of a car?' And when asked 'What is the first thing you notice about
girls' bodies?' Michael readily declares 'Breasts]' which produces lots of
whooping from the audience and laughter from the female contestants. There
is norra lorra that on Cilla Black's prim little show. If you must have
programmes of this sort then Studs is far more honest and amusing than the
British version - and the American contestants are not required to deliver
those embarrassingly over-rehearsed 'jokes'.
As for Chances, Episode 1 looks like seven parts Neighbours, two parts
Dallas and one part Valley Of The Dolls. As in all Aussie soaps people say
'Without further ado' and 'I gotta hand it to yer, Digger' but the
semi-nudity is tasteful enough to let it get by in Cheltenham. With
terrestrial broadcasters so eager to kowtow to the Victorian hypocrisy which
still dominates taste in Britain, such tiny moves towards more adult
material will surely help dish sales.
*****
Of the three new comedies The Big One (Thursdays on Channel 4) is the most
fashionable, Mulberry (Mondays on BBC1) the most likely to last, and So
Haunt Me (Sundays on BBC1) the funniest. That is not to say that So Haunt Me
is another Fawlty Towers: there no longer seem to be any writers with the
self discipline, nor department heads with the willingness to impose the
discipline, necessary for the creation of series as consistently funny as
that. Still, I have several times found myself laughing out loud at events
in Paul A. Mendelson's account of a family moving into a terraced house
which is haunted by an extremely Jewish mother, played with relish by Miriam
Karlin. Mulberry is the name of the general factotum played by Karl Howman
(familiar from Brush Strokes) who is hired by the not-so-very batty old
grande-dame Miss Farnaby, played by Geraldine McEwan. This is hardly the
sort of stuff that makes you roll off the old green sofa, but there is
foreseeable strength and mileage in the relationship, and I suspect some
viewers will grow fond of this peculiar couple. The stars of The Big One are
Mike McShane and Sandy Toksvig, another odd couple, he huge and she tiny,
and yet another pair of alumni from Whose Line Is It Anyway. They have in
The Pocket Dream in London's West End, and the television series has them
sharing her horribly messy flat. Toksvig is one of the three funniest women
on British television (the others being Victoria Wood and Dawn French) but
although some of the lines in The Big One are amusing, the idea that an odd
domestic pairing is in itself enough to support a comedy series has, surely,
worn perilously thin.
*****
Some aspects of Channel 4's book review programme, Burning Books, are
admirable: they get through a fair number of books quite quickly, the
reviewers mostly seem more concerned with the books than with proving how
clever they are, and it makes a wonderful change to have two people dealing
with a book and not to know which is the interviewer and which the
interviewee. The form here is for two people to discuss the book across a
table as equals. Other aspects, however, can be very irritating: the huge
flames are distracting because they look downright dangerous, the chatter at
other tables in the background is also distracting, and last week an
American journalist was allowed to deliver her review to camera in a high
pitched monotone which was virtually incomprehensible.
*****
The willingness of broadcasters to co-operate with the spin doctors of the
political parties is becoming embarrassing. One of the parties 'launches' a
poster - a poster, for goodness sake - and the news programmes dutifully
send along reporters and camera teams to record the event, for all the world
as though something significant was occurring. How long before the
broadcasters are summoned to record the 'launch' of a politician's new
hairstyle? Before this election campaign there was talk of ITN behaving this
time like proper adult journalists and treating everything on its merits,
even if this meant that at the end of the day slightly more attention had
been paid to one side than the other. The hope was that the BBC might then
follow suit, but all the signs are that the broadcasters are as timid as
ever. The stopwatches are running and airtime is being divided not according
to news values but according to party entitlement. The idea that television
journalists ought to follow the example set by their print predecessors 200
years ago and fight for their independence seems as distant as ever.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Management (Health Check): Waking up to the secret of sleep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When you wake in the morning, you feel refreshed, bound out of bed ready for
the new day, your energy unlimited. This is the way it is meant to be.
Chances are, however, that if you have a stressful job your sleep will be
troubled. After a long day at work, you return home, exhausted, have a
ritual nightcap, slide between the sheets, puff up the pillows and go off to
sleep.
You wake suddenly, staring at the ceiling, aware of the light from the clock
radio. You hesitate to check the time, but cannot resist: '2:30 AM'. Then a
voice in your mind starts to review the day's events: business negotiations,
a cryptic medical report, financial worries and domestic problems.
To make matters worse, you start worrying that you are awake and begin to
fret over whether you will able to cope the following day. This is the start
of a vicious cycle of stressful days, followed by sleepless nights and more
stressful days, leading at worst to a nervous breakdown. Where did you go
wrong?
The source of the problem may be the way you perceive sleep. Many executives
view sleep as a pause on the road to success, necessary to cool over-heated
engines, but sleep is much more than that. It is a creative period during
which the mind deals with all the seeds you have digested during the day.
For decades, sleep experts have been using clinical signs and electrical
waves emitted from the brain to discover the secret of sleep. They have
found that a night's sleep consists of a cycle repeated four or five times
during an eight-hour period. The cycles are made up of stages of increasing
depth, each ending with a period of Rapid Eye Movement sleep during which
muscles twitch, temperature and blood pressure fluctuate and dreams of glory
and disaster buffet you.
In order to get your sleep cycle back on track there are some useful steps
that can be taken.
BEFORE GOING TO BED
Do not eat heavily or consume alcohol within 90 minutes of retiring.
Do not go through your bank statements.
Do not watch violent films.
Do not discuss finances with your spouse.
Do not consume coffee after 3pm.
Do not dwell on anything likely to make you angry or sad.
All these give the body and mind too much to process while other matters
should be tended to. The aim is to control events so that nothing worrying,
alarming, or stimulating happens before you go to bed.
Instead, you should:
Reserve your bed for rest.
Decide that you are going to sleep well.
Avoid alcohol and sleeping pills - they cut out REM sleep.
Tire your body with exercise.
Soothe your mind with things that have nothing to do with work, such as
chess or TV.
Have a hot bath.
Drink warm milk with honey.
DURING THE NIGHT
Do not become preoccupied with an occasional sleepless night, as these are
perfectly normal. But to lose sleep over lost sleep is unnecessary.
If sleeplessness persists, get out of bed, drink some warm milk, take a bath
and read some Tolkien.
Acknowledge the mental voice as it starts the litany of worries, but do not
begin a conversation with it.
WHEN YOU GET UP
Do not assume that you are unrested as you have not had the minimum sleep
you need. How much is enough? It varies widely, but in general enough to
sustain a daily energy level, commensurate with the demands of work and
play.
If nothing else works, consider a change of pace, or of surroundings.
The author is the medical director of the Insead Business Health course.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Management: Godfathers get control - Andrew Baxter and
Andrew Bolger investigate the steps BTR is taking to integrate Hawker
Siddeley into its operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What should managers expect to face if they are taken over by BTR, the
acquisitive UK industrial conglomerate? Executives of Hawker Siddeley have
been finding out since BTR won a bitterly contested Pounds 1.55bn takeover
battle for one of the most famous names in British engineering.
Within days of the bid victory last November, every Hawker managing director
and finance director in Europe was summoned to a hotel at Heathrow airport
to hear about BTR, and its plans for Hawker.
Robert Faircloth, recently appointed as BTR's chief operating officer, has
been supervising the integration. 'A key is to create a sense of urgency
very quickly,' he says.
Although BTR executives are careful not to criticise their counterparts at
Hawker, Faircloth says this approach was a change for Hawker, where there
'was not the highest or greatest sense of urgency'.
But BTR admits that it is learning a few lessons as well as dishing them
out. Its proposal to create a global electrical engineering business,
revealed in the final stages of the bid, has been dropped - suggesting that
Hawker knows more about its businesses than BTR supposed.
For Faircloth and Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, the change of plan
shows that during their first 100 days at Hawker, speed has been tempered by
a determination not to jump to conclusions about any part of the engineering
group's sprawling empire.
The past few months have been a testing time for Hawker's managers. Their
first hurdle was to come to grips with BTR's strict financial planning and
controls system. At the Heathrow meeting, they were shown what Faircloth
describes as 'the real bible of BTR, our profit planning programme - in the
form of a written manual and computer disk'.
'We simply said 'OK, get familiar with our plan technically and
philosophically, take your plan, put it on to our forms and we'll take a
look at it'.' At the same meeting, BTR rammed home the importance of
discipline in the monthly financial reporting that underpins the group's
profit planning.
Faircloth says Hawker's month-end reporting lacked such discipline: 'They
probably reported on the fifth day after the month-end: but if you were out
someplace, so what, you didn't do it until later'.
In contrast, by the third working day after every month ends, senior
executives in BTR's worldwide operations have figures for orders, sales,
profits, and return on sales for every operation. By January both groups
were reporting on a common basis.
At the same Heathrow meeting, Hawker's managers were introduced to BTR's
'A-team' - a group of about 30 senior managers who had been studying Hawker
intensively for months. In the weeks before BTR's victory, the A-team had
been allocated to follow Hawker's seven business divisions and were now
paired with their counterparts.
Faircloth told the Hawker managers: 'Here is the person to be your minder,
godfather, counsellor. Not your boss, we'll keep the structure virtually in
place, but this is the man who's going to acquaint you with BTR. However, he
has one authority - he's going to control the purse strings.'
Most expenditures above Pounds 20,000 needed the approval of the minders.
Faircloth, a tough, no-nonsense American, says: 'We would say 'You can't buy
an automobile', just so we could get a handle on the automobile policy.'
However, BTR says several important items of capital expenditure were
approved during this clampdown, which has now been lifted.
The next stage was a programme of worldwide factory visits to allay
uncertainty. By Christmas, BTR had visited 96 per cent of all Hawker's
facilities. 'There was a remoteness existing in the company - our style is
to meet people and show an interest in the business,' says Faircloth.
BTR had a form which its managers and Hawker's would fill out as they walked
through a plant: were there leaky roofs, what was the general appearance?
At the same time, the BTR teams were making simple appraisals of the Hawker
managers, giving them scores of one to 10.
Between 75 and 80 per cent of the 100 or so people who were assessed had
their management skills scored as average to above average. BTR is full of
praise for how Hawker managers responded to what Faircloth describes as a
'pretty horrendous drill' in terms of 60-70 hour weeks.
All this data started flowing back to BTR's 'war room' in Wokingham,
Berkshire. Faircloth personally visited Hawker's perceived problem areas
such as instruments and controls, and general engineering.
The initial phase of the takeover came to a climax in mid-January, when BTR
revealed its management structure for the enlarged group. Some of the
integration team assumed management control of Hawker businesses, while
others went back to their former jobs. Several Hawker men retained control
of their businesses, and some were given increased responsibility.
The entire exercise has been useful in a number of ways to BTR. Information
collected during the 100 days has identified those Hawker businesses - such
as rail - which are likely to need strategic partners to survive.
Not that Hawker managers have finished jumping through hoops - or being
assessed. Faircloth said the scoring exercise will be repeated at the end of
March, but this time the standards are going to be higher. 'Without showing
my hand, it is going to be a different result.'

FT  11 MAR 92 / Management (Training on Trial): Low marks for slow learners
 -Anne Weinstock says trainees with special needs deserve more help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE WEINSTOCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few topics have exercised the minds of Training and Enterprise Councils
quite so much as the training of people with 'special' needs.
The Tec Operating Manual states that there should be no discrimination
against people who cannot learn at the same rate as others.
Michael Howard, the employment secretary, insisted that Tecs define in their
business plan the specific ways in which they would train disadvantaged
groups. However, with little financial incentive, monitoring or evaluation
systems, some question his real commitment.
The last two years have seen big reductions in Tec budgets, the notional
idea being that employers invest more in training. However, the recession
has decreased employer contributions for work experience placements.
The financing of Tecs is such that the higher the level of qualification
attained, the greater the financial reward to the Tec. If Tecs do not meet
their targets in terms of qualifications, they can lose 25 per cent of their
budgets.
Not surprisingly, they concentrate on those who can reach the desired level
in the shortest possible time and for the lowest possible price.
So what needs to change? We are constantly told that an adaptable and
flexible workforce is the key to our future. It follows that our national
training system must reflect these characteristics. We need to review the
contradictions between the National Vocational Qualifications framework
(which allows for recognition of individual achievement) and the funding
structure of Tecs (which determines that achievement below a certain level
of competence is failure).
There is a number of forward-looking Tecs which have introduced flexible
training for people with special needs, despite having no financial
incentive to do so. But we should not have to depend on their generosity. We
should be building on what young people are capable of achieving from their
own starting point, rewarding individual progress.
Many employers on Tec boards still believe that young people leaving school
without even the basic skills of literacy and numeracy are not their
'problem'. It can and often does cost more to train people with 'special'
needs. But with the advent of a single Europe and a fall in the number of
school leavers, a training framework to maximise the skills of all young
people will become an economic imperative.
How long it will take those responsible for studying Tecs to realise this,
remains to be seen.
The early evidence for the 1992-93 contracting round suggests that
inequality of opportunity will continue to be the order of the day.
The author is chief executive of The Rathbone Society, a national charity
and voluntary organisation for people with learning difficulties. She is
also a director of Manchester Tec.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Business and the Environment: Numbers plucked out of the sky
 -IT is playing a bigger role as companies struggle to improve their green
record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure on business to improve its environmental performance will increase
the load on information systems and on the people who manage and design
them.
This is because environmental management is largely about managing
information. If a large company such as ICI, for example, were to take part
in the EC's impending Eco-audit scheme, it would probably have to audit its
220 manufacturing sites in 40 countries and ensure that the results were
accessible for inspection. This would place a heavy load on its existing
information systems. It is still unclear, however, what specific tools will
be needed for the job.
One of the messages from business and politicians is for companies to
improve their environmental performance by conducting regular audits to
measure progress. But these procedures are relatively new and there are no
universally agreed standards, although the overriding emphasis is on the
collection and systematic storage of information. There is also pressure to
develop standards for environmental reporting to be included in the year-end
accounts.
UK law is not yet as strong as that in the US which forces certain
industries to publish precise information on emissions, in the Toxic Release
Inventory. But it looks likely that EC legislation will eventually force
member states to provide more information about industrial pollution.
Another demand for data will be driven by eco-labelling schemes for consumer
products, which are planned by most developed countries, as well as the EC.
To obtain a label companies will have to provide comprehensive information
about their products and manufacturing processes.
Martin Houldin, environment specialist at management consultants KPMG, says
much of the necessary information already exists within companies. 'The
challenge is to extract the data from various parts of the business,
consolidate it and then present it to managers in an acceptable format,' he
says.
This process will, initially, demand the skills of an information manager
who can understand the function of the information and who knows how the
data is generated and where it is stored.
The UK government, for example, is looking for a consultancy to re-organise
and expand its nationwide air monitoring system. The information is offered
to scientists and the media for air quality reports.
The job of improving the system demands knowledge of the subject, experience
with the technology and an ability to translate raw scientific data into a
form which people can understand.
Roger Bagnall, environment products manager at International Business
Machines, says most of a company's initial needs could be satisfied with
existing software tools. 'There is an obvious need for databases, document
storage and retrieval systems, electronic mail and presentation software,'
he believes.
Suppliers of information technology see the environmental market divided in
two. The most easily defined area is the fast-growing demand for specific
software tools designed for the environment-services sector, such as
air-flow models.
The other area, which is more general but still embryonic, will demand the
expansion of existing information systems within companies.
But because environmental pressures have an impact on nearly every part of a
business, the initial demand will be on providing better systems planning to
prevent information bottlenecks from developing.
Many companies in the environmental services sector - including water and
power utilities, waste managers, makers of pollution-prevention equipment,
environment consultancies and government regulatory agencies  - are rather
behind in the development of computer systems. There are obvious
opportunities here for IT suppliers to sell office systems and other
well-established technologies.
Water companies are already providing a considerable market for IT
suppliers. Severn Trent Water, for example, is building an automated
monitoring and remote control system for its plants. The National Rivers
Authority, the UK govting up an automatic monitoring scheme in eastern
England. The system has 12 monitoring stations covering 14 different
stretches of river. The stations send information via telephone lines to a
central computer system.
Electronic data interchange (EDI) systems, which also rely on
telecommunications, should eventually find buyers among companies trying to
reduce their environmental impact. These data communication systems, which
are used to send electronic documents such as order forms between two or
more companies, would improve the communications between waste managers,
pollution inspectorates, local governments and water utilities.
Some manufacturing companies have already seen the potential to improve
efficiency and reduce paper consumption by expanding their EDI systems.
Start-rite shoes, a maker of children's shoes based in Norfolk, has expanded
its EDI system to achieve more efficient delivery (less fumes and transport
hazards) and to reduce the use of paper.
Most of the information which businesses require in order to take the first
steps towards better environmental management will probably be found within
the organisation.
There are many ways in which the IT industry could develop tools to make
this task easier. An obvious parallel is with executive information systems
(EIS) which tap into a number of sources, re-arrange the data and then
present it in a digestible form to managers. The IT industry is starting to
identify this need but it will be some time before it designs something
comparable to an EIS for the environment.
Environmental software products now available are mostly technical tools
designed for environmental consultants and manufacturers. These consist
mainly of remote sensing devices, such as a sensor bolted to a chimney stack
to measure emissions, feeding into data capture devices. They are all
stand-alone devices so the IT manager's immediate task is to feed the
information into the main system.
Environmental pressures are beginning to create opportunities for IT
suppliers to sell existing products to companies, such as water utilities
which have been traditionally light users of IT. This is an expansion of
existing markets and requires little more effort on behalf of the supplier
other than to identify a need.
Far more complex is the consultancy-based help that suppliers could offer IT
managers in companies which have to consolidate information held in diffuse
sources. The demand will be for information specialists who not only have a
grasp of the technology but who can understand the nature of the
environmental demands on the client's business.
There are also opportunities for IT companies to develop software tools to
do specific and complex jobs, such as modeling and the visual presentation
of complicated environmental data. These business areas already have been
identified by companies such as Digital Equipment and IBM.
The primary demand on companies is to identify their needs for environmental
information early enough to design the appropriate systems. One of the
biggest threats is the development of independent systems which will be
difficult to integrate into the mainstream.
Another potential difficulty lies in the human problem of ignoring early
warnings signs, or hoping that the information needs will not be as heavy as
predicted.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Business and the Environment: Greeks battle to defeat the
'nefos' - Kerin Hope finds the air in Athens stifling / Urban Air Pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a warm, still morning the 'nefos' or pollution cloud that plagues Athens
is all too visible: a streaky, yellow haze masking the western suburbs and
the sea.
The nefos first appeared in the early 1970s, after a steady migration to the
capital by villagers and islanders triggered a speculative building boom
that left little room for parks and gardens. For each Athenian there is only
2.5 sq metres of green space, the lowest in any European capital.
The warnings of a few prescient city planners, who called for large-scale
planting of trees on barren hillsides around the city and construction of a
network of ring roads, were ignored by successive governments. The result
was a steady growth in atmospheric pollution levels.
The nefos is caused by temperature inversion, in which polluted air trapped
between the sea and the mountains enclosing the Attica basin is prevented
from escaping by the presence of a warmer layer above. After 36 hours
without any wind, a severe pollution episode may ensue: admissions to
hospital rise, people with respiratory problems are warned to stay indoors
and the environment ministry imposes a traffic ban.
However, the composition of the nefos has changed over the years. From being
a Third World cloud containing high levels of sulphur dioxide and smoke, it
has become a California-style photochemical smog, rich in ozone and liable
to spread over a wider area of the city.
Initial efforts to combat air pollution by reducing sulphur levels in petrol
and domestic heating oil and curbing industrial emissions proved moderately
successful. Meanwhile, the population of greater Athens stabilised at around
3.2m, while government investment incentives encouraged industries to
relocate outside Attica.
But the number of cars and vans circulating in Athens rose from 175,000 in
1970 to 1.34m in 1991. Vehicle emissions are now held responsible for about
75 per cent of the air pollution.
A severe shortage of parking space adds to the problem. With over 40,000
cars parked illegally on an average weekday, traffic congestion worsens,
increasing emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen dioxide.
For the past decade, half the city's cars have been banned from weekday
driving in a 25 sq km central district, according to the final digit on
their number-plate. Although the odd and even driving restrictions help to
ease the traffic problem, they have only a small impact on pollution levels.
Instead of using public transport, many Athenian families acquired an
appropriately numbered second car, usually an elderly vehicle liable to emit
thick, black exhaust fumes.
'Athens was becoming a graveyard for cars. The average age of the fleet was
11 years, compared with six for the rest of the EC. Only 7 per cent of it
was being renewed annually, again a very low rate,' said Nikos Patsatzis, an
urban transport consultant.
The picture has changed in the past year, with the introduction of tax
breaks for purchases of new cars equipped with catalytic converters,
available to owners who turn in an old-technology vehicle.
Yet, the capital still lacks a co-ordinated long-term plan for coping with
air pollution. City planners, epidemiologists or meteorologists are rarely
consulted by environment ministry experts. Even the methods used to measure
air-pollution levels around the city are not consistent from year to year.
One development, a scheme to fit the bus fleet with Greek-designed smoke
traps which eliminate more than 95 per cent of smoke and soot emissions, is
being delayed. Although the devices have operated successfully on 100 buses
for the past two years, the transport ministry says it cannot come up with
Dr1bn (Pounds 3m) needed to equip the other 1,700 city buses.
Athenians blame the nefos for a host of ailments, from headaches and nausea
to eye irritation and chest pains, and even inability to concentrate. But it
is only in the past three years that epidemiological studies have managed to
pinpoint a connection between pollution episodes and increased mortality
rates, mainly among older people already suffering from respiratory
complaints.
The government pins its hopes on eventually reducing pollution levels on two
much-delayed projects, construction of an extension to the Athens
underground system and of a pipeline to bring Russian natural gas to the
capital.
The Dr 250bn Metro project will add two new lines crossing the city centre,
which are expected to carry 350,000 passengers daily from 1997, many of whom
now travel by car or taxi. The gas project should enable both households in
the city centre and factories to stop using diesel fuel altogether after
1994. But only the most optimistic of Greeks believes the nefos will ever be
dissipated.
Next week's article will focus on Los Angeles.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Jobs: At last, an impartial gauge of deep recession - Latest
research shows change in the sorts of executives most prone to redundancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN old rag-trade friend of the Jobs column, called Harry Vos, had a
benchmark for gauging the severity of recessions. 'You don't need telling
times are bad,' he used to say, 'when they're firing the brothers-in-law.'
I pass on his quip with some trepidation because, on recent experience, it
will provoke protests. An increasing number of people, especially but not
only in America, evidently now deem it 'racist' for gentiles to retail
Jewish jokes.
So it is fortunate that research has just identified a different benchmark
for denoting severe recession, which is racially neutral albeit less funny.
Another of its drawbacks is that, as the research concerned is the
psychological kind to do with personality traits, the new benchmark needs
explanation.
Its history starts in the mid-1980s with two studies which applied a
standard personality test (the Cattell 16PF) to executives who had lost
their jobs. The first was made by Cranfield business school in harness with
the Pauline Hyde and Associates outplacement consultancy, the second by the
University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology with Coutts
Career Consultants.
The findings were striking. Both studies showed that the executives who had
been picked for dismissal at the time were the sort that - to the eyes of an
impartial observer, at least - their companies would have done better to
keep.
The discards were not only more than averagely imaginative, go-getting,
forthright and bright intellectually. They were also calmer and
self-confident with it.
Even so, the research suggested reasons why it was they, rather than
colleagues with less sterling qualities, who had been chosen for the chop.
The findings showed that their strengths were matched by weaknesses. They
were high in forthrightness at the expense of being low in shrewdness, for
instance, and imaginative at the cost of lacking canny realism.
In sum, it seemed that the redundancy victims of the mid-1980s were
typically folk who, although unusually well equipped for executive work in
some ways, were bereft of the political abilities on which survival in
organisations so often depends.
But the research didn't stop there. With more and more of Britain's
upper-rankers being thrown out of jobs, psychologists have continued their
probings. One in particular is London-based consultant Lea Brindle, who has
to date studied some 700 discarded executives.
He has discovered that, as the numbers axed have multiplied, the picture of
the typical victim seven or so years ago has shaded into a different one.
And, to the Jobs column's mind at least, the point at which that change
takes place is a useful benchmark for the onset of a truly severe recession.
The picture that emerges from standard personality tests on more recent
victims is one that has no outstanding feature whatsoever. When compared
with the average executive, they are on average just average.
You surely don't need telling times are bad when that happens. True, the
overall average hides a multitude of individual differences. But the
recession has evidently reached a depth where executives have an equal
chance of being chosen for the chop regardless of their particular mix of
strengths and weaknesses, according to the most commonly used measures of
personality at any rate.
Accordingly, over recent months Dr Brindle has checked whether the blank
face of the average can be enlivened by the use of less standard measures.
The main one he has tried is the 'Team Types' analysis, developed by the
British training expert Meredith Belbin, which divides people into nine
different categories as follows:
Co-ordinators. They typically act as the team's 'social leaders', calmly and
self-confidently steering the other members in line with broad objectives,
but without acting in an overbearing way and not necessarily being
officially in charge or outstanding intellectual or creative thinkers. What
they are above all is motivators.
Shapers. They are the team's 'task leaders', taking it on themselves to
ensure their colleagues do the work assigned to them. While outgoing in
manner, shapers are personally competitive and don't suffer what they see as
fools gladly. Highly motivated individually, they often strike others as
arrogant and abrasive.
Plants. They act as the team's original thinkers. Intellectually brighter
than their colleagues, they generate new ideas at the expense of overlooking
detailed realities. Although usually introverted, they are nonetheless
thrusting and tend to cause umbrage by criticising others' ways of
operating.
Resource investigators. They tend to be the most personally likeable members
of the group, being sociable and stimulating as they go around collecting
information from their many outside contacts and showing instant interest in
new possibilities. But while ready to improvise under pressure, they are not
original thinkers, and can easily become bored, demoralised and ineffective.
Specialists. They are the team's sources of specific knowledge and
expertise. Single-mindedly devoted to their chosen field, and working on
their own initiative and often imaginatively within it, they tend to be
single-minded loners.
Evaluators. Logically minded and serious, they are typically viewed as 'cold
fish' by their team-mates. Showing little personal motivation, they
constantly analyse and nit-pick without offering anything original. Their
main value is in stopping colleagues from rushing down blind alleys.
Completers. They are the team's worriers, ceaselessly on the lookout for
things that might go wrong. Preoccupied with order and detail, they tend to
lose sight of the broader scheme of things.
Implementors. Outstandingly self-disciplined, they are above all else
practical organisers who sort out objectives and pursue them methodically
and efficiently, although rarely with imagination.
Team workers. They have all the collective virtues, being good communicators
as well as highly efficient personally, and sensitive promoters of harmony.
As they rarely assert themselves, however, they are apt to be undervalued.
That perhaps explains why, of all the nine types covered by Lea Brindle's
latest checks, team-workers emerge with the least distinction. The only way
in which they stand out from the average is in being poorly paid, a drawback
they share with the implementors, completers and evaluators. The best paid,
at least in the job they were dismissed from, are the co-ordinators, plants,
specialists and resource investigators.
Since all of the types studied had received the chop, Dr Brindle was of
course unable to compare them with colleagues who had avoided it. All he
could examine was how long the rejects had been with the discarding
organisation. The shortest lasting were shapers, resource investigators,
plants and specialists. The longer stayers were the implementors,
completers, evaluators and co-ordinators.
But when he checked on those whose own direct boss had been changed within
the previous two years, a difference appeared. While the pattern otherwise
was the same, co-ordinators changed from long- to short-survivors.
When he looked at rejects' speed in finding new jobs, the general pattern
tended to reverse. Slower than average were completers and evaluators.
Quicker were plants and resource investigators - but not, alas, the
short-staying shapers who more than any of the other types ensure that
things actually get done even if not always to their colleagues' liking.

THE HEXHAM Conservative association yesterday set up a selection committee
to start sifting applications from potential parliamentary candidates to
succeed the constituency's MP Mr Alan Amos.
Mr Amos announced late on Monday that he would not fight the Northumberland
seat in the general election. This followed his being cautioned by police
after what he described as an 'incident' in London.
Hexham, where Mr Amos won by an 8,066 majority in 1987, had been considered
the only safe seat of the Conservatives' four constituencies in north-east
England.
Mr David Roberts, Conservative central office agent in the north-east,
yesterday declined to say whether the Hexham association would be able to
select a candidate by the weekend if the prime minister this week calls a
general election for April 9.

SCOTTISH Enterprise, the body at the centre of the network of local
enterprise companies (Lecs) which handle economic development and training
in Scotland outside the Highlands, is cutting its share of the network's
budget for next year and giving proportionately more to the Lecs.
The core body, now called Scottish Enterprise National, is to take Pounds
65.2m, or 14 per cent, of the network's Pounds 462.6m budget. It began last
year with 17 per cent of the budget.
Three of the larger Lecs - Glasgow Development Agency, Lothian and Edinburgh
Enterprise, and Grampian - have had their budgets reduced. Lanarkshire
Development Agency, grappling with the problems of the closure of steel
plants including Ravenscraig, will receive Pounds 50.2m. Glasgow gets Pounds
58.1m. Other Lecs, including Ayrshire, Dunbartonshire and Forth Valley, also
receive increases.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE House of Lords has reserved judgment on an appeal over the powers of
local authorities in England and Wales to enforce Sunday trading laws. The
decision is not expected before next month.
Kirklees Borough Council, West Yorkshire, backed by attorney general Sir
Patrick Mayhew, hopes to overturn a Court of Appeal ruling which made Sunday
trading restrictions virtually unenforceable.
A European Court ruling on the validity of Sunday trading laws in England
and Wales under European Community law is expected later this year.
The Kirklees appeal concerns whether local authorities, seeking court
injunctions banning Sunday trading, must indemnify retailers for loss of
Sunday profits in the event of the European Court upholding the traders'
position.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Factory-gate prices up 0.4% in February
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANNUAL rate of core inflation stuck at 4.4 per cent in February after a
higher-than-expected monthly increase. Prices rose by 0.4 per cent in the
month.
Figures issued by the Central Statistical Office yesterday show that in
February the year-on-year rate of increase in the prices of factory goods -
the key rate of core inflation - was the same as in January, which was the
lowest figure since mid 1988.
Although the figures disappointed City expectations of a 0.3 per cent
monthly increase, economists said underlying inflation remained on a
downward trend.
The latest data suggest many manufacturers are avoiding price increases in
an attempt to maintain sales in a climate of fragile demand.
Excluding volatile items such as food, drink and tobacco, the index rose
only 2.8 per cent on the year compared with a 3.1 per cent rise in the year
to January.
The CSO said this figure was the lowest since June 1969, when it was 2.7 per
cent. It compares with a peak of 6.4 per cent in February last year.
However, the cost of raw materials and fuel used by manufacturing industry
jumped by 1.6 per cent between January and February, bringing the annual
rate of increase to 0.5 per cent after a fall of 1.1 per cent in the 12
months to January.
The CSO said the higher-than-expected increase was due mainly to the higher
prices of sheep, lambs and pigs.
It also reflected a stronger US dollar against the pound and other European
currencies.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Winds of change may be gaining pace in Ecuador: Sarita
Kendall examines the pre-election mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE strong winds blowing everywhere else,' said a leading Quito
businessman, 'but not even a breeze here.'
That was a little unfair to Ecuador President Rodrigo Borja, who has begun
the process of opening-up the country, albeit more gradually than most of
his neighbours. Tariffs have been lowered and tax reforms introduced, and
Ecuador now finally expects to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt) and is taking part in regional trade agreements.
Nevertheless, the fear that Ecuador is being left behind by political and
economic developments in Latin America has strengthened the chances of the
two front-running candidates in May's first round of presidential elections:
Mr Sixto Duran and Mr Duran, both linked to the private sector.
The state apparatus has, if anything, grown in size and power under the
current Social Democrat government. Relations between the public and private
sectors have been thoroughly acrimonious and were exacerbated by a recent
dispute over the price of medicines which led to arrests. Foreign investors
are so frustrated by bureaucratic tangles and the slow pace of negotiations
that, according to one oil man, 'we sometimes wonder whether they really
want foreign companies here.'
Despite its rich resource base and stable democratic government since 1979,
Ecuador's per capita income dropped during the 1980s, following the Latin
American trend. While annual inflation never reached triple figures, it has
remained around 50 per cent over the last three years. This year's aim is to
reduce the rate to 30 per cent by June, but, with elections approaching,
there is pressure to ease off austerity and encourage economic reactivation.
It seems unlikely that the government and the banks will make any progress
towards resolving the debt problem at this late stage. The total foreign
debt stands close to Dollars 12bn, and Ecuador has reached agreement with
the International Monetary Fund and the Paris Club. But the government's
unshakeable proposal for a 70 per cent discount on the Dollars 5.7bn
commercial debt, combined with its failure to keep up full interest
payments, has left bankers disenchanted.
Although banana and shrimp exports leapt to record levels last year, oil
still contributes about 40 per cent of foreign earnings and half of fiscal
income: lower oil prices are having a serious impact on government finances.
Oil production has stabilised at about 300,000 barrels a day, with small new
fields compensating for declining reserves in the older structures. But the
revamped and inflated state oil corporation has stalled on new exploration
contracts.
Infrastructure and the public services have suffered as a result of keeping
charges dampened down and lack of investment. Low rainfall along the eastern
Andean cordillera reduced the water flow into the country's main
hydro-electric at Paute to a dribble. Electricity cuts of more than 10 hours
a day in early February disrupted industries, services, traffic, lights and
homes, while officials argued about who was to blame - not so much for the
drought, as for the poor planning and silted up reservoir which foretell
future electricity shortages.
Mr Borja did, however, enjoy a sudden spurt in popularity as a result of
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori's visit to Ecuador in January. Quito's
residents gave Mr Fujimori an expectedly warm welcome, and both the
Ecuadorean military and political candidates have been forced to recognise
that the 50-year-old south-eastern border problem is no longer an issue to
rouse Ecuadoreans.
An 'honourable' solution now seems possible, perhaps involving papal
arbitration and Ecuadorean access to the Amazon river.
Both Mr Duran, who leads the presidential opinion polls, and Mr Nebot, who
is second, apparently favour a border agreement. Those further down the list
 -there are 12 presidential candidates in all - probably have little chance
of victory, though the run-off system can cause surprises: unless one
candidate wins more than 50 per cent of the vote on May 17, when
congressional and local government elections also take place, the two
leading contenders go forward to a second round in July.
Mr Duran, a former public works minister launched by the United Republican
Party, presents himself as the friendly, experienced businessman who can get
roads built and pull the country out of economic stagnation without radical
upsets. Mr Nebot, younger, less predictable and more charismatic, has strong
support from the private sector of Guayaquil and belongs to the Social
Christian Party. Economic liberalisation, privatisation and attracting
foreign investment form part of both candidates' platform.
The next president, who will take office on August 10, not only has a
backlog of financial and economic problems to deal with, he must also face
the fact that Ecuador is no longer such a peaceful backwater. Bomb scares,
murders and armed robberies are commonplace. Drug use, drug trafficking and
money laundering are increasing and estimates of the drug money filtering
through now run from Dollars 500m to over Dollars 1bn.
While Ecuador is still seen as a drug transit country rather than a
production centre, Mr Borja's successor may have trouble keeping it thus.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US, Germany and Japan top the league of industrialised countries
investing in research and development, a motor of economic growth, according
to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development statistics
published yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
But while 60 per cent of US money goes into military projects, Bonn and
Tokyo are most active in funding civilian science and technology, reaping
rich export benefits.
Figures released by the 24-nation OECD as science ministers met in Paris
showed that research and development accounted for 2.8 per cent of US,
German and Japanese gross domestic product, compared with only 1.3 per cent
in Canada and Italy.
Private enterprise accounts for most science spending in Japan and Germany
but the government finances half of all research and development in the US.
Only in France does the government role in funding approach the US level.
Defence takes the lion's share of research and development budgets in the US
and a sizeable share in Britain and France - but gets less than 11 per cent
in Germany and Japan, the figures showed.
The US was one of the few OECD countries where the share of research and
development carried out in the civilian business sector did not grow in the
1980s.
Japan, with the fastest growth rate for private sector science spending,
became even more oriented towards industrial research and development.
In the European Community, industrial investment in research and development
grew through the 1980s while the proportion financed by governments declined
significantly.

<DATELINE>
   MIAMI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER Panamanian leader General Manuel Antonio Noriega said yesterday he
would not testify in his drug-trafficking conspiracy trial in Miami.
He said he had made the decision because 'my presentation would have to be
limited not to include political matters, issues of war, and the (1989 US)
invasion.'
The decision was announced as the general's defence rested its case in the
trial underway in Miami since last September.
Prosecutors yesterday began to present a rebuttal case in which several
agents of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) will testify.
If convicted on 10 drug and racketeering counts, Gen Noriega could get up to
140 years in prison.
In a hearing before trial judge Mr William Hoeveler, with the jury absent,
one of Gen Noriega's attorneys, Mr Jon May, asked the judge to order the
government to make further disclosures which the defence had a right to
know.
A major part of the defence argument rests on the fact that the DEA did not
inform either prosecutors or the defence about an on-going money-laundering
investigation it had carried out with Panamanian authorities until after the
prosecution had completed presenting its case against the general.
A former Panamanian legislator testified on Monday Gen Noriega personally
lobbied for a tough anti-drug law finally passed in late 1986. The
legislation made drug prosecutions easier and for the first time outlawed
money laundering.

FT  11 MAR 92 / World Trade News: EC warns Japan on bilateral US deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRUSSELS yesterday warned Japan not to strike bilateral trade deals with the
US that might lose the EC its toehold in the Japanese market and raise its
deficit with Tokyo.
In talks yesterday, Japanese officials provided the EC with details of
Tokyo's recent agreement to double imports of US-made car parts over
1990-95. But the Commission said it still lacked pledges this deal would not
discriminate against EC producers.
In general, the Commission conceded the cause of the EC's mounting deficit
with Japan lay more with the nature of the goods traded, and the structure
of the Japanese market, than with the relatively few specific tariffs and
obstacles Japan still imposes on imports. The EC deficit rose from Dollars
18bn (Pounds 10.2bn) in 1990 to Dollars 27bn last year, Japanese statistics
show.
Half this deficit stemmed from four sectors of Japanese exports to the EC:
mass-market cars, telecommunications, electronic data processing and
components, for which European demand is strong. By contrast, such EC
exports as luxury cars, high-value textiles and alcohol are sensitive to any
downturn in Japan.
Thus, the Commission has changed tactics. Instead of mounting the kind of
rhetorical assault typical from Brussels only a few years ago, it is
adopting a lower-key approach. This involved sending to Tokyo last month its
one member - Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner - never linked
with protectionism.
Sir Leon complained of structural impediments, such as difficult access for
foreign lawyers who could help EC companies establish themselves. A year
ago, EC investment in Japan was less than one-fifteenth (Dollars 3.3bn) of
Japanese investment in the EC (Dollars 55.3bn).
Brussels plans in May to send EC governments a 'communication' on links with
Japan. By then, it will be clear if a Gatt deal, removing, say, public
procurement barriers to Japan buying more EC satellite/telecommunications
equipment, is possible this year. If not, the EC will pursue its case
bilaterally with Japan, perhaps invoking last year's EC-Japanese political
declaration to give it extra leverage on trade issues.
The European Court of Justice yesterday rejected an appeal by eight Japanese
companies against EC dumping duties imposed in 1987 on their photocopiers.

<TEXT>
KUWAIT has begun a feasibility study into opening up a free trade zone, Mr
Abdul Rahman Nibari, head of the emirate's Port Authority, said yesterday,
Our Middle East Staff reports. Mr Nibari said Kuwait had chosen one out of
10 consultancy groups from the US, Britain, France and the Netherlands which
had offered to carry out the project, though he would not name the company.
Kuwait hopes to develop entrepot trade with Iran to compensate for loss of
trans-shipment trade it enjoyed with Iraq before the Gulf war. 'The free
zone will help activate the national economy and commercial business, and
bring the latest technology,' Mr Nibari told the Kuwaiti News Agency KUNA.
The study on a free zone, to compete with Dubai's Jebel Ali port, which
already carries a large amount of entrepot trade with Iran, will take eight
months to complete. Shuwaikh Port, Kuwait's biggest sea inlet, would have to
be expanded before the zone was set up. Kuwait had been toying with the idea
of a free zone before Iraq's 1990 invasion, to revive its role as a major
re-export centre in the Gulf.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GHANA's trading partners in Gatt yesterday welcomed the 'substantial
progress' in liberalising the Ghanaian economy but urged further reforms to
boost economic performance.
At the same time, they acknowledged a more open economy made Ghana more
dependent on better access to foreign markets and a strengthened
international trading system, and thus on a successful conclusion to the
Uruguay Round trade talks.
A report on Ghana's trade policies by the Gatt secretariat, discussed
yesterday by its governing council, says sweeping reforms since 1983 have
made a highly protectionist economy an outward-looking one. In face of
constraints posed by Ghana's dependence on primary commodities and high
indebtedness, the reforms had succeeded in improving economic efficiency and
reviving the traded-goods sector.
Despite export diversification, cocoa still accounts for about half Ghana's
export receipts, with minerals and timber products accounting for a quarter.
Half Ghana's trade is with the EC, which gives preferential access to its
cocoa and other agricultural exports under the Lome Convention.
Ghana's reforms have included several currency devaluations and introduction
of a market-based exchange rate system, a near-halving of average
(unweighted) tariffs to about 17 per cent, and the scrapping of
comprehensive import controls. But the Gatt report notes Ghana still has
relatively high tariffs on consumer and 'luxury' goods, protects much of
domestic industry with special import taxes, and maintains a variety of
state aids, discriminatory tax policies and export incentives and curbs. Mr
Kojo Amoo-Gottfried, Ghana's ambassador to Gatt, said yesterday Ghana was
committed to more reform.

FT  11 MAR 92 / World Trade News: US chip maker leads drive for tougher
tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DRIVE for legislation to impose import tariffs on Japanese, European and
Korean semiconductor chips as well as all electronics products containing
such devices sold in the US is being led by Micron Technology, a US memory
chip manufacturer.
The proposal comes as US chip industry executives gather in Washington to
decide their next moves in the long-running US semiconductor trade row with
Japan. It reflects growing frustration at lack of progress on removing trade
barriers in Europe and South Korea. Long a rebel in the US semiconductor
industry, Micron was the first US chipmaker, in the mid-1980s, to file a
dumping suit against its Japanese competitors. That proved a catalyst for
broader US industry complaints, leading to the first US-Japan semiconductor
trade pact in 1986.
Last year, key elements of the first accord were renewed, promising foreign
chipmakers 20 per cent of the Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.3bn) Japanese
semiconductor market. Now Micron, the tenth biggest US semiconductor
producer with fiscal 1991 sales of Dollars 425m, is again breaking ranks by
urging punitive steps against countries that have failed fully to open their
markets to US chip products.
Micron also alleges dumping by Japanese and South Korean memory chip makers.
Mr Joseph Parkinson, Micron chief executive, is leading the call for tough
action. In a letter circulated in the US industry, Micron asks executives to
contact their congressmen 'in support of a bill proposing an immediate 14
per cent countervailing tariff.
'The tariff is justified against the Japanese on the basis of their failure
to comply with the (1991) semiconductor agreement by dumping product, and
their failure to provide the agreed 20 per cent market-share access,'
Micron's letter says. Europe's enforcement of a 14 per cent tariff on chip
imports, and South Korea's tariffs and lack of market access, are cited as
reasons for crackthose countries. But Mr Parkinson's proposals are
embarrassing the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), which has led the
US industry's trade battles for 10 years.
He is this year's chairman of the industry group, and as such the industry's
official spokesman. Yet his proposal runs contrary to SIA opposition to
import tariffs which it sees as a 'protectionist trade barrier'. Since
import tariffs would raise chip prices in the US, Mr Parkinson's proposal
threatens to undermine the SIA's tentative coalition with US computer makers
who provide the US chipmakers with political firepower in Washington.
But the SIA will consider Mr Parkinson's proposal, among others, at its
board meeting today, Mr Andrew Procassini, SIA president, said. He stressed
the SIA 'does not favour measures that would disadvantage its customers in
world markets'.
The SIA had been expected to raise the spectre of economic sanctions against
Japan and issue a strong statement expressing dissatisfaction with the
progress to lifting trade barriers in Europe. Faced with Micron's more
radical proposal, the SIA may well move faster to seeking US government
retaliation against Japan, Europe and Korea.
Japan's electronics industry reacted angrily yesterday to a US semiconductor
industry report saying a bilateral microchip pact was near failure and
raising the prospect of sanctions if market access fails to improve, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
'We are making every possible effort,' Mr Tamotsu Harada, a spokesman for
the Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ), said. 'The outlook
may be a bit grim right now, but to speak of retaliation is going too far.
'Are they saying it's all right for us to stop trying?'

Bulgaria offers the advantage of an export platform to the republics of the
former Soviet Union, he told business leaders at a meeting organised by the
Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. 'Nowhere is there better knowledge and
experience of their markets.'
A liberal foreign investment law had been passed allowing repatriation of
profits, and a privatisation law was being considered by the parliament.
Telecommunications heads Mr Dimitrov's list of investment priorities.
Bulgaria offered a special advantage for this industry, he added. Under the
now-defunct Comecon, Bulgaria had been designated by Moscow as the country
specialising in computer production and it has many electronics experts and
computer programmers. Tourism and agribusiness investments are next on
Bulgaria's list. The Bulgarian-American Enterprise Fund, based in Chicago,
has been authorised to make available Dollars 55m (Pounds 31.2m) over three
years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The National Front wants to let parents vote on behalf of their minor
children in a move to encourage French people to have bigger families,
Reuter reports from Paris.
The so-called 'family vote' was one of 51 social proposals in a manifesto
issued by the anti-immigrant party led by Jean-Marie Le Pen ahead of March
22 regional elections.
'The place of families in the national community must be enhanced. It is
abnormal that children who ensure the future of the nation do not count in
elections,' it said.
'It is therefore important to establish full universal suffrage by giving
the right to vote to every citizen, adult or minor. This vote will be
exercised by the parents: the father for boys and the mother for girls,' the
National Front said.
Bruno Megret, the party's chief ideologist, said the idea was logical since
parents were legally responsible for their children.
The manifesto said the children would have no say until they turned 18 and
could vote for themselves.
The National Front's social charter also featured proposals to stop child
benefit and welfare payments to immigrants, give French nationals priority
in state housing and student grants, and pay mothers to stay at home and
raise children.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Question of arms points up Czechoslovak divisions: Slovak
MPs fight to keep the weapons industry in the face of federal attempts to
curb output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ARMOURED carrier can be had in Prague these days for about Dollars 1,600
(Pounds 909). Federal deputies put one on show in front of the parliament
building last Friday. They said they had found it on sale in a used car
shop.
Czechoslovakia, once the largest producer of conventional weaponry in the
former communist bloc after the Soviet Union, is finding it hard to control
a flourishing arms market.
Since the end of communist rule, the authorities have sought to curb
production, halt exports and convert weapons factories to peaceful
production. But many producers, and trade officials, have been determined to
carry on selling, in part because of the lack of alternative work in the
post-communist era.
Attempts to restrict the market were blocked in parliament yesterday by
Slovak MPs worried about the impact on one of their region's most important
industries. Most of the country's factories are in Slovakia, where
unemployment is about 12 per cent.
The Slovak deputies refused to adopt a constitutional amendment laying down
strict conditions for the import and export of arms and drugs. Parliament's
failure to adopt the legislation leaves the way clear for arms merchants
operating in a virtually unfettered market.
In a small grocery store in Holesovice, a Prague suburb, the sales assistant
denies vigorously that he intends to sell weapons. Yet officials at the
federal ministry of economics say the shop's address appears alongside an
offer for arms sales made by an unregistered Czech company in a Brazilian
newspaper.
At the Federal Ministry of Foreign Trade, officials from the embattled
republic of Georgia come out of the arms trade department and walk away
furtively.
A legislative loophole means that while licences to export products must be
granted by the federal ministry of foreign trade, deal-making is unregulated
and a spate of private companies have set up shop to try to sell a range of
military products.
'Nowadays, officially, anyone can go into the arms business if he gets a
licence. As a result, everybody is trying to go into the business. At the
same time, producers are lowering the prices because they are eager to sell.
So one ends up with dumping prices often 30 to 40 per cent below the
original prices,' explains Mr Stanislav Kozeny, chairman of Omnipol, the
once all-powerful company which held a monopoly on arms trade under the
former regime.
Mr Stefan Glezgo, head of the arms trade department in the Foreign Trade
Ministry, who put forward the bill rejected yesterday, wants to restrict the
sales of weapons and the granting of export licences to a few selected
companies.
'We are not afraid of companies choosing arms trade as business. But we want
them to let us know about it and give us all the detailed relevant
information,' says Mr Glezgo.
He adds that licences are not granted easily. Last year, only 28 companies
were granted licences to export military products and these included many
manufacturers. Furthermore, he says, all controversial cases are referred to
an inter-ministerial commission which must approve the deals.
Efforts by federal authorities in Prague to control the arms market have
repeatedly run into the opposition of Slovak politicians. Nationalism plays
a crucial role in Czechoslovakia's ability to control both its arms
production and trade.
Eighty per cent of the defence industry lies in Slovakia, the smaller and
poorer of the country's two - Czech and Slovak - republics. In 1991, arms
production in the whole country, amounting to Kcs7.6bn (Pounds 150m) reached
barely 50 per cent of the previous year's level. Slovak arms factories,
which employ some 80,000 workers, face enormous social difficulties as they
try to restructure production towards civil output.
To ease the transition, the federal government has launched a conversion
programme which last year granted Kcs1.5bn to support projects for civil
production in arms factories. But the resistance of arms producers has
hampered the programme. 'The Slovak factories want to continue producing
tanks and their managers are hiding information from us,' says Mr Josef
Fucik who supervises the conversion programme at the federal ministry of
economics.
Arms producers have put growing pressure on the federal authorities to allow
them to export weaponry in order to survive. Last year, the federal
government approved the sale of 252 T-72 tanks to Syria over objections from
the US and Israel.
'There are too many competing interests within the government which is
trying to balance economic and political imperatives,' says Mr Martin
Palous, deputy foreign affairs minister who sits on the inter-ministerial
supervisory commission.
'The licence department of the foreign trade department comes to us with
done deals. If we say yes, it means billions of korunas for the country. If
we say no, it means we don't respect the economic interest of
Czechoslovakia. It's like trying to square a circle.'
Pressure from arms factories has increased alongside Slovak nationalism. The
plight of the arms industry has fuelled resentment against federal policies
in Slovakia. The most popular politician in the republic, Slovak nationalist
leader Mr Vladimir Meciar, has promised to keep the industry afloat if, as
expected, he wins next June's general elections.
'The first priority of the new Slovak prime minister will be to maintain
standards of living. And in Slovakia, this is linked directly to allowing
the arms factories, the republic's main hard currency earners, to sell' says
Mr Kozeny, of Omnipol.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Treuhand finds buyers for three shipyards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREUHAND privatisation agency has secured its last major sale, finding
buyers for eastern Germany's troubled shipbuilding industry.
It said yesterday three of the five large companies belonging to the
state-owned Deutsche Maschinen- und Schiffbau are to be sold to Kvaener, a
Norwegian group and to Bremer Vulkan of western Germany. The Treuhand is
also talking to Danish and Norwegian buyers to sell the other two yards.
Kvaerner is to buy the Warnow and Neptun yards, east Germany's largest
shipyards, based in the Rostock area. Bremer Vulkan is to take over the MTW
shipyard in Wismar, and DMR, a diesel engine producer based in Rostock.
Mrs Birgit Breuel, Treuhand president, said the decision to sell the core of
the industry to the two companies had been 'one of the most difficult the
agency has had to make'.
The European Commission will have to examine the sale because state funds
are involved. The Treuhand, whose governing board is expected to approve the
sales next Tuesday, said it was confident the Commission would approve the
level of state aid needed.
The state government of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where the yards are based,
said yesterday it would unveil a restructuring plan for the industry today.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, said last week that any
plans for the shipyards would have to include a basic restructuring plan
before the Commission could consider approving the level of state aid.
Brussels officials are seeking assurances that the restructuring would be
sufficiently realistic to make the yards competitive by the end of 1993,
when all state aid to shipbuilding in the Community is to be abolished.
Mrs Breuel indicated yesterday the sale represented a compromise between
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party (CDU) and its junior
coalition partner the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), and between the two
parties in the state government of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
The CDU had sought a comprehensive privatisation with state aid while the
FDP said there should be no subsidies and that unviable parts of the
industry should be closed.
The Treuhand said the number of workers in the three shipyards would be
reduced from 10,300 to 7,000. Trade union representatives at the shipyards
claimed the sales violated a 'package deal' for the sale of the entire
industry.
Thousands of shipyard workers are to demonstrate today outside the
parliament of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern which is to debate and approve its plan
for the shipbuilding industry.
Mr Hartmut Rower, chairman of the action committee of workers at the
Neptun-Warnow shipyards, called the deal a 'rotten egg.' The unions have
also argued that the future of the industry would be more secure in the
hands of a single buyer. Mr Rower said he feared Kvaerner would close the
shipyards and sell the property.
Tough negotiations with the companies are likely to take place over the
amount of state subsidy. The Treuhand previously indicated it was prepared
to assume more than DM1bn (Pounds 300m) in shipyard debts as well as a
substantial portion of the DM900m needed in investments. The agency
previously guaranteed liquidity loans of DM1.3bn to the shipbuilders.

<TEXT>
A European court yesterday upheld the bulk of anti-cartel fines imposed on
seven chemical companies by the European Commission, which has recently lost
several competition cases for sloppy procedure, writes David Buchan in
Brussels.
The Court of First Instance, which is the European Court of Justice's lower
tribunal, was ruling on appeals against fines which the EC executive imposed
in 1986 on companies for running a market-sharing cartel in polypropylene
between 1977 and 1983.
The court reduced the fines on Shell from Ecu9m (Pounds 6.39m) to Ecu8.1m,
on ICI from Ecu10m to 9m, and on Huls of Germany from Ecu2.7m to 2.3m,
because it said these companies were not part of the cartel for as long as
the Commission had claimed. But fines on Hoechst (Ecu9m), Montedipe
(Ecu11m), Solvay (Ecu2.5m) and Lindz (Ecu1m) were upheld.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Madrid government yesterday closed ranks in support of the embattled
governor of the Bank of Spain, Mr Mariano Rubio, who is at the centre of a
scandal over the failed Ibercorp banking group.
The government denied that Mr Rubio's departure from the bank was imminent.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, refused Mr Rubio's offer to resign
last month and confirmed him as governor until his term expires in July.
'Mr Rubio's situation remains the same. Nothing has changed,' a spokeswoman
said. Earlier Mr Carlos Solchaga, economy minister, denied that the cabinet
was divided over maintaining the governor in his job during the next four
months.
Mr Rubio had offered to resign after an investigation by the Stock Exchange
commission into the broking arm of Ibercorp, a financial services group run
by close friends of his and which managed his personal portfolio. The
commission is investigating alleged share price manipulation, discrimination
in favour of certain clients and other possible fraudulent practices.
The latest allegation is that Mr Rubio's sister, her husband and a first
cousin were the administrators of a Luxembourg-based investment fund whose
shares in Ibercorp were bought back by the group two years ago before the
share price collapsed. The Stock Exchange commission is also investigating
this investment company, but Mr Rubio's lawyer said the governor could not
be held accountable for the activities of his relatives.
Banco Ibercorp, the group's merchant bank, was taken under the wing of the
Bank of Spain last week when it was unable to meet outstanding loans and its
broking activities were suspended pending the investigation.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Banker warns on German inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN inflation, at 4.3 per cent, is still too high to allow the Bundesbank
to cut interest rates, according to criteria laid down by a leading banker
in Bonn yesterday.
Mr Friedel Neuber, chairman of the Westdeutsche Landesbank, the biggest Land
(state) bank in Germany, said the German economy would recover during the
year and the Bundesbank would be able to ease interest rates a little.
However, the timing of the reduction depended mainly on developments in
prices and pay. 'An inflation rate of 4 per cent cannot be tolerated,' he
added.
His comments followed an announcement from the federal statistics office
that a 0.6 per cent rise in consumer prices last month had pushed annual
inflation in west Germany to 4.3 per cent, compared with 4 per cent in
January.
The climate in the current pay round is also unpromising, with most unions
claiming around 10 per cent.
However, banking workers, who have disrupted business for the past two weeks
with scattered warning strikes in pursuit of their 10.5 per cent demand,
showed signs yesterday that they would accept the employers' offer of
renewed talks.
The banks needed a period of peace, Mr Gerhard Renner, chief negotiator for
the DAG clerical union, said, indicating that strikers should go back to
work and that he would settle for 6.5 per cent. The employers have so far
refused to go beyond 5 per cent.
The union claims its demand is justified by sound results in the sector. The
upward trend was confirmed yesterday by Mr Neuber, who is also president of
the VoB banking association, representing around 50 state banks. He said its
members had increased their aggregate balance totals by 9.9 per cent to
DM1,350bn (Pounds 468bn) last year. Credit business had been especially
strong, he added, with lending to business and private individuals
increasing by more than 15 per cent.
Public service unions, meanwhile, launched a threatened wave of warning
strikes with a demonstration by 500 workers in Berlin. Claiming a 10.5 per
cent increase, the 2.3m workers have been offered 3.5 per cent by federal
and state employers.
IG Metall, representing around 4m engineering employees, meanwhile said that
the Gesamtmetall employers' association was on a catastrophe course. While
no formal offer has yet been made, Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, Gesamtmetall's
president has suggested that a maximum of 2 per cent would be 'economically
reasonable.' The union is claiming 9.5 per cent.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday promised to maintain
strict budget discipline, rein in federal spending and reduce the state
deficit.
Government targets, he said, 'exclude new payments and increases which
cannot be matched by savings in other parts of the budget'. The federal
deficit, which climbed to DM52bn last year, from DM47bn in 1990, is expected
to fall again this year.

FT  11 MAR 92 / The UK Budget: Doubts cast on interest rate cut as sterling
loses value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON financial markets accorded the Budget speech a somewhat cautious
response which was reflected in a downturn in government bonds as early
gains in sterling were trimmed sharply during the progress of Mr Lamont's
speech in the House of Commons.
Sterling's reaction appeared to cast serious doubts over the prospects for
the pre-election base rate cut on which the financial markets have been
counting.
A government official said: 'It would not be wise to hold out much hope of a
cut in the next few days'.
Several analysts pointed out that it could now prove very difficult to cut
rates ahead of the announcement of the election date which is expected
before the end of the week.
In addition, market strategists expressed doubts on the political impact of
the budget which had been widely regarded as a curtain raiser to the
Conservative government's campaign for re-election.
'This is not a budget for voters,' commented Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss
Turnbull.
The stock market held on to gains which had been largely achieved early in
the session and the FT-SE Index closed 24.1 points up at 2,574.8. But
traders sounded increasingly nervous after equity trading closed, and a fall
in the March future contract on the FT-SE Index appeared to be signalling a
weak opening today.
The currency markets were generally unimpressed by the Budget, and saw it
doing little to strengthen sterling in the short term.
Sterling immediately fell around  1/2 pfennig to wipe out most of its
earlier gains. Dealers said this was because of the lack of a firm
commitment to move the currency into the narrow band of the ERM, and Mr
Lamont's forecast of a Pounds 28bn PSBR - towards the upper end of
expectations.
'The Budget was not a clear-cut vote winner and in the meantime it merely
prolongs the uncertainty in the markets,' said Mr Nick Parsons, treasury
adviser at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
'The commitment to the narrow ERM band was vague, and the chancellor also
seemed to be backtracking slightly on his commitment to a single European
currency, and this was not welcomed by the market.'
Mr Michael Feeny, senior dealer at Sumitomo Bank, said however that while
the Budget was 'not tremendously dramatic', it could add a few per cent to
Conservative support in the opinion polls.

<TEXT>
THE US, Germany and Japan top the league of industrialised countries
investing in research and development, a motor of economic growth, according
to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development statistics
published yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
But while 60 per cent of US money goes into military projects, Bonn and
Tokyo are most active in funding civilian science and technology, reaping
rich export benefits.
Figures released by the 24-nation OECD as science ministers met in Paris
showed that research and development accounted for 2.8 per cent of US,
German and Japanese gross domestic product.
This compared with only 1.3 per cent in Canada and Italy.
Private enterprise accounts for most science spending in Japan and Germany
but the government finances half of all research and development in the US.
Only in France does the government role in funding approach the US level.
Defence takes the lion's share of research and development budgets in the US
and a sizeable share in Britain and France - but gets less than 11 per cent
in Germany and Japan, the figures showed.
The US was one of the few OECD countries where the share of research and
development carried out in the civilian business sector did not grow in the
1980s.
Japan, with the fastest growth rate for private sector science spending,
became even more oriented towards industrial research and development.
In the European Community, industrial investment in research and development
grew through the 1980s while the proportion financed by governments declined
significantly.

<TEXT>
THE productivity of American workers inched up 0.3 per cent last year as the
economy struggled to emerge from the recession, the US government said
yesterday, AP reports from Washington. The growth reversed two years of
decline.
The Labor Department also said productivity in the final three months of
1991 jumped a revised 1.7 per cent annual rate, more than the 1.1 per cent
estimated initially.
Productivity had increased by a 0.9 per cent annual rate in the third
quarter, 1.9 per cent in the second and 0.1 per cent in the first.
Increased productivity, defined as getting more output from workers per hour
of work, is considered vital to increasing Americans' standard of living
without increasing inflation. It also boosts the competitiveness of US goods
overseas.
The 0.3 per cent annual growth in productivity was a bit stronger than the
0.2 per cent initial estimate.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Brazil steps up war on cartels

<TEXT>
THE Brazilian government's continuing war against cartels and oligopolies
intensified yesterday with the summoning of representatives from various
industries including steel and paper to explain 'abusive price rises'.
Some 90 legal suits have been started against various companies, mainly in
areas of pharmaceutical products and household cleaning items, for raising
prices by as much as 90 per cent above inflation this year, to compensate
for falling sales.
The decision came amid predictions that last month's inflation figure (due
to be released today) would reach 24 per cent. Although lower than January,
it is higher than the government had been hoping; the index for Rio,
published yesterday, was still above 25 per cent.
Economy ministry officials said they remained sure the downward trend would
speed up, and are working on the basis of 21.2 per cent for March.
They blame the continued high index on the behaviour of cartels and
oligopolies.
One sector especially under fire is the car industry. Many car dealers have
been refusing to buy vehicles because of frequent price rises. Yesterday,
the Car Dealers Association said they would begin legal proceedings against
manufacturers for 'abuse of prices'.
The government is expected to threaten accelerated reduction of import
tariffs on products where increases have outstripped inflation. Other ideas
include reimposition of price controls.

FT  11 MAR 92 / Economic woes dent peace-time hopes of Lebanese: The main
union claims government policies are 'anarchic and inflationary'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LARA MARLOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY a year and a half after the end of the civil war Lebanon's hopes for
rapid reconstruction and a return to commercial and banking prominence in
the Middle East have faded.
In the space of two weeks, the Lebanese pound lost 30 per cent of its value
and inflation rocketed. At the start of the month, the main Lebanese trade
union called for sit-ins and demonstrations to protest against government
economic policies it calls 'anarchic, inflationary and impoverishing'. A
general strike on March 6 was widely observed, reflecting the general
discontent.
European Community foreign ministers have blocked Dollars 86m in aid because
of the continued detention in Lebanon of two German hostages. Hospitals have
stopped accepting medical insurance pending a revision of inadequate payment
schedules. Lebanon has even requested it be exempted from its annual Dollars
550,283 Arab League dues because of economic difficulties.
Mr Omar Karami, Lebanon's prime minister, has accused the US of provoking
the crisis by blocking foreign aid and opposing military sales which would
strengthen the Lebanese army. But Lebanese are almost unanimous in blaming
their pro-Syrian government for the debacle.
'Searching for lost confidence,' read a front-page headline in the
French-language daily L'Orient Le Jour, summing up the country's despondent
mood. 'Every Lebanese knows the weakness of a worm-eaten administration
which, like a cadaver, feeds a cloud of parasites through its own
decomposition,' the paper said. 'Caught in a vicious circle. . . the more
the state flails about like a drowning man, the deeper it sinks.'
The government continues to spend far more than it collects in taxes, ) and
this coupled with its inability to attract reconstruction aid or increase
state revenue are at the heart of the crisis.
The Lebanese government is the largest employer in the country, spending 50
per cent of its budget on salaries and another 40 per cent on servicing the
public debt.
The root causes of the crisis have long been present: war-ravaged
infrastructure, an import-based consumer economy and a cumbersome government
bureaucracy.
But the runaway inflation and currency depreciation of the past few weeks
were sparked off by two official moves, both announced on February 19: the
central bank's decision to let the Lebanese pound float freely against the
dollar and an across-the-board 60 per cent private sector pay rise.
Fighting between Israelis and Lebanese militiamen in southern Lebanon that
same week further aggravated the downward spiral.
The Banque du Liban (BDL) had since mid-1991 stabilised the pound at about
LPounds 880 to the dollar. But worsening conditions late last year forced
the BDL to spend up to Dollars 400m in foreign currency reserves to support
the pound. Faced with further depletion of its remaining Dollars 856m in
reserves, the BDL decided to cease intervention on currency markets. After a
steep fall three weeks ago, the pound has stabilised at LPounds 1170 to the
dollar.
An emergency economic plan announced by the government simply reiterated old
promises to limit government spending and increase state revenue. Interest
rates on treasury bills were raised to more than 18 per cent, providing the
government with cash but swelling the public debt, which now represents 57
per cent of the BDL's assets.
The policy of increasing taxation on consumer items such as fuel and
cigarettes - and even collecting income tax  - has done little to encourage
Lebanese who enjoy negligible basic services and have seen prices shoot up
some 40 per cent in two weeks. The ministry of posts and telecommunications
this week ordered Lebanese citizens to pay phone bills by the end of the
month or have their lines cut. The telephone system barely functions and no
bills have been delivered for the past four years.
Even the price of arabic bread, the basic food staple here, was officially
increased by 32.5 per cent at the start of the month. In spite of last
month's pay rise, the official minimum wage still stands at just over
Dollars 100 per month, a ludicrous amount in a country where prices can
rival those of Europe.
The pay rise was within days neutralised by the depreciation of the pound
and concomitant inflation.
None the less, plans for a multi-billion dollar 'Manhattan of the Middle
East' to be built on the ruins of downtown Beirut continue under the aegis
of Lebanese-born Saudi millionaire Rafiq Hariri's 'Council for Development
and Reconstruction'. Positive political developments, such as the liberation
of the two German hostages, progress towards an Israeli withdrawal from
southern Lebanon or even the successful holding of parliamentary elections
(vaguely promised for this summer or autumn) could bolster the confidence
that is now so sorely lacking.
But the decline of recent weeks has at least temporarily confounded those
Lebanese who claimed their dynamism, entrepreneurial fervour and free-market
economy would suffice to raise Lebanon from the ashes of war.

FT  11 MAR 92 / UK pre-election budget doubles deficit to Pounds 28bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, yesterday launched
the Conservative party's general election campaign with a budget that stole
some of the pet economic policies of the opposition Labour party.
Mr John Major, prime minister, is expected to announce today that the
election will be held on April 9, capitalising on the government's surprise
fiscal package targeted at low income voters.
Mr Lamont unveiled a new 20 per cent lower band of income tax on the first
Pounds 2,000 (Dollars 3,500) of taxable income and extra help for poorer
pensioners in a budget that also extended help to smaller businesses and the
car industry.
But he held back from widely tipped moves such as cutting the basic income
tax rate from 25 per cent or raising personal allowances by more than the
inflation rate.
Mr Lamont forecast higher budget deficits than City of London analysts had
expected. For 1992-93, Mr Lamont forecast a public spending borrowing
requirement of Pounds 28.1bn (nearly Dollars 50bn), or 4 1/2 per cent of
gross domestic product.
This is more than twice the PSBR of Pounds 13.8bn, or 2 1/4 per cent of GDP,
Mr Lamont now expects for 1991-92. The City had expected a 1992-93 deficit
of Pounds 25bn, and the government had forecast one of about Pounds 18bn in
November's autumn statement. For the current year, the City had expected a
deficit of about Pounds 12bn, and Mr Lamont had forecast Pounds 7.9bn in his
first budget a year ago.
The package provoked a mixed initial reaction on financial markets, with
equities moving higher. But sterling and government gilt-edged securities
fell on concern about the high deficit.
While market reaction implied no early fall in interest rates, Mr Lamont
later indicated that he did not rule out an interest rate cut during the
election campaign. Although such action would be virtually unprecedented, he
said that would be 'a matter for me and the Bank of England'.
Mr Lamont limited the overall budget 'giveaway' to Pounds 1.5bn in 1992-93,
compared with Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn forecast by many commentators, by
raising taxes on tobacco and leaded petrol and vehicle excise duty by more
than the rate of inflation.
Mr Lamont described his package as a 'budget for the recovery'. But its
immediate impact was to present a challenge to Labour. The party has long
advocated the introduction of a reduced rate band to help the lower paid.
But if it accepted it now, it would be unable to sustain its claim that the
Conservatives were guilty of electoral bribery.
Mr John Smith, who would replace Mr Lamont as chancellor if Labour won the
election, said his party would oppose the lower rate band at the core of the
budget package, prompting Mr Lamont to promise a formal House of Commons
vote on the issue later this week.
Senior ministers voiced confidence that the package - a careful political
balancing act designed to steal Labour's most attractive clothes while
deflecting charges of bribery - would hand back the political initiative to
the Conservatives.
Mr Lamont's measures were designed to win over key groups of voters in the
key election battlefields.
Changes in the uniform business rate, a property tax, are aimed at boosting
Conservative support among small businessmen in marginal constituencies in
southern England. The halving of car tax should benefit the motor
manufacturing industry in the Midlands. Inheritance tax changes are designed
to win votes from farmers in rural areas as well as from small businessmen
across the country.
Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, said tax cuts paid for by public borrowing
represented a 'panic-stricken, pre-election political sweetener', but party
leaders privately acknowledged the package had left it with awkward choices.
In his budget speech, Mr Lamont painted a picture in which economic recovery
had effectively been postponed for a year. He described a path of recovery
that would be very similar to that first outlined in last year's budget. He
forecast 1 per cent growth in GDP this year with the rate quickening as the
year progresses. Retail price inflation is expected to fall to 3 3/4 per
cent at the end of this year and 3 1/4 per cent by mid-1993 from 4 1/4 per
cent in the final quarter of 1991.
Mr Lamont started his speech by announcing a surprise plan to combine the
government's autumn statement spending plans and the spring budget into a
comprehensive December budget from December 1993, itself a Labour policy.
Mr Kinnock sought to reinforce the contrast between Labour's long-term
commitment to economic revival and a short-term Conservative 'fix'.
Mr Lamont, however, said British voters would be presented with a clear
choice between a party committed to cutting taxes - particularly for the
lower paid - while maintaining good public services and one committed to
increase the tax burden on everyone.
Both sides admitted that voters' reaction would be critical in shaping the
course of the election. The Conservatives, currently fractionally behind in
the opinion polls, are relying on the budget to push them into the lead.
Ministers acknowledged, however, that there were still doubts over how a
package widely acknowledged at Westminster to be politically astute would
'play' with the electorate. 'I am not sure whether they (the voters) will
grasp it quickly', one minister said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW YORK law firm has agreed to pay the US government Dollars 41m and to
bar two of its partners from acting for financial institutions as part of an
out-of-court settlement of a Dollars 275m federal lawsuit charging that the
firm withheld information from regulators about the collapsed Lincoln
Savings and Loan.
The failure of the California-based Lincoln, which was run by Mr Charles
Keating, cost the government Dollars 2.6bn and is considered one of the
worst S&amp;L failures in recent history.
The charges were brought only a week ago against the New York law firm of
Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler by the Office of Thrift Supervision
(OTS), the regulator of the S&amp;L industry.
The law firm agreed to settle the charges, without admitting any guilt,
because federal officials moved to freeze the firm's assets. The OTS has now
agreed to drop charges in exchange for the settlement.
The New York settlement could set an important precedent as federal
officials are planning to bring a number of legal action against lawyers,
accountants and S&amp;L industry executives involved in failed institutions.
In a separate development, the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), the US
federal agency handling much of the clean-up of America's crippled S&amp;L
industry, has brought lawsuits claiming Dollars 250m from two major
accounting firms that are accused of 'gross negligence' in their audits of
two failed thrifts.
The RTC is seeking Dollars 150m in damages from Deloitte &amp; Touche of Wilton,
Connecticut for alleged negligence in connection with the firm's audits of
the failed Otero Savings and Loan Association of Colorado.
The RTC charges that Deloitte's audits of Otero between 1983 and 1988
resulted in losses of Dollars 150m.
The RTC has also filed a complaint against KPMG Peat Marwick of New York,
seeking more than Dollars 100m of damages resulting from the firm's audits
of the failed Hill Financial Savings Association of Pennsylvania.
The RTC action against Peat Marwick charges the firm with negligence,
negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract.
The 1989 failure of Otero cost US taxpayers an estimated Dollars 195m, while
the failure of Hill Financial carried a taxpayer cost of Dollars 988m.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Haiti: a theatre of the absurd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the confusion spawned by the compromise intended to return constitutional
government and ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to Haiti, there are a
few things that are clear.
One is that the agreement as it is, even if it results in Mr Aristide's
physical presence in Haiti, will not achieve its objective.
In a weekend statement, widely held to be at the instigation of the military
which effectively runs the country, Mr Joseph Norette, the army-appointed
president, said he will not step aside for Mr Aristide, and that Haiti's
constitution demands that he hands over to a newly elected president.
Legislators opposed to Mr Aristide have blocked the ratification of the
conditions for his return.
By any measure, the agreement is flawed, but it could even realise the
opposite of its intended end by formalising the coup which overthrew Mr
Aristide, leaving the Caribbean state under the effective control of the
military and the president with only the trappings of power.
The agreement proposes that:
the Haitian legislature ratify the appointment of Mr Rene Theodore as prime
minister;
Mr Aristide and the prime minister meet fortnightly to assess the progress
of efforts to create a climate for the president's return;
an amnesty be granted to all involved in the coup;
all decisions taken by the Haitian legislature be honoured;
the Organisation of American States (OAS) lift a trade embargo on Haiti.
The pact does have some value, although not directly to Haiti.
Since the coup at the end of September, when Mr Aristide was sent into
exile, the OAS has been working for Mr Aristide's return. It imposed a trade
embargo and sought, with little success, to force the military backed
government to accept the former president.
The embargo was a failure. While it effectively killed Haiti's fledgling
light industrial sector by forcing factories to close, sporadic shipments of
fuel - with which some OAS members were linked - kept the country going.
More significant was the increased volume of trade across the border with
the Dominican Republic, and from which the Dominican military made fat
profits. Brokering this latest agreement has allowed the OAS to save face.
It has also been of some assistance to the US which, at times, appeared to
waver in its support for Mr Aristide, and was being attacked for its
decision to return thousands of Haitians seeking asylum.
The pact could give the impression that the situation in Haiti will soon be
normal, and that there is, consequently, little reason for Haitians to flee.
Mr Aristide has not helped by fomenting confusion over one of the more
sensitive aspects of the compromise.
As far as Haitian legislators and Mr Theodore are concerned, the agreement
with Mr Aristide protects the current status of the military leaders,
allowing an amnesty for all involved in the coup, except for 'common
criminals'.
Yet Mr Aristide has subsequently argued that General Raoul Cedras, the
leader of the military, will be punished for his part in the affair.
The president has promised, however, that Gen Cedras will be given a chance
to present arguments 'as to why his punishment should be lessened'.
All this is unlikely to mollify an army which, at heart, does not want Mr
Aristide to return, and which wishes to hang on to effective control of the
country and resume its highly lucrative activities such as the transhipment
of narcotics from South America to North America.
Mr Aristide's mere presence in the presidential palace would not effectively
alter Gen Cedras' control of the country and the likely crusades by the
president's supporters to redress the situation will have a bloody end.
This explains the value - to the OAS, to Haiti's legislators and to Gen
Cedras, but not to Mr Aristide - in the open-ended clause concerning the
timing of the president's return. Clearly, he cannot return in a climate of
tension and uncertainty, and with the military objecting.
According to Mr Jean Casimir, Haiti's ambassador to the US, an immediate
return by Mr Aristide would be 'suicidal'.
Mr Michel Francois, the police chief who operates with apparent independence
from the military (the police is commanded by the military) has already let
it be known that he would be unhappy with Mr Aristide's reoccupation of the
presidential palace.
It is not inconceivable that a few well-timed incidents could indefinitely
delay Mr Aristide's return.
Aware, perhaps, that he and the army which overthrew him cannot live in the
same house, Mr Aristide may now be rethinking that part of the agreement
which promises to leave Gen Cedras and his lieutenants untouched. Yet the
army will not voluntarily concede to a man who has said that its leaders
must be punished.
While inside or outside of Haiti, the president and the current military
leaders will continue at daggers drawn.
Respecting the decisions of the parliament taken in his absence  - including
the wholesale release at Christmas of members of the 'tontons macoute', the
feared praetorian guard of the Duvalier dynasty which was overthrown in a
popular revolt six years ago - could leave Mr Aristide in a theatre of the
absurd.

PERUVIAN state airline Aeroperu will be sold to the private sector within
the next 60 days, according to an announcement on Sunday by Copri, the
privatisation commission.
A further 13 wholly or partially state-owned companies will also be
privatised in the same period.
These include the chain of filling stations owned by Petroperu, liquid gas
company Solgas, the Conchan oil refinery, Petrolera Transoceanica and the El
Pacifico chemical company.
The state will also sell its entire holdings in the local Bayer chemical
company and in Cementos Lima.
Companies are to be sold either through the Lima stock exchange or by public
auction.
Copri emphasises that the procedure will be public, transparent and honest.
The government also announced the forthcoming privatisation of Petroleos del
Mar (Petromar).
Petromar was formed to exploit the oilfields formerly belonging to US-owned
Belco after its 1986 expropriation.
The government of President Alberto Fujimori recently reached a settlement
with Belco's insurers, American Insurance Group, over a long-standing claim.
Revenue from the Petromar privatisation will be used in part compensation.

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE package of political, economic and social initiatives announced last
week by Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, has raised serious
questions about the future of his unpopular economic reform programme,
writes Joseph Mann from Caracas.
President Perez last Thursday disclosed a broad range of initiatives aimed
at raising general support for his administration and at stemming the
attacks from political foes, including members of his own political party.
The most important of these initiatives were:
a return to price controls on a limited number of items, such as petrol,
electricity, pharmaceuticals, and a small basket of basic foods;
new or accelerated programmes in housing, transportation, health and
education;
institution of a luxury tax, a new tax on corporate assets and other fiscal
measures;
pledges to install a constituent assembly that would effect major
constitutional reforms and choose a 'cabinet of national unity'; reforms
aimed at reducing corruption, including the replacement of five Supreme
Court justices, bills to reform the legal system and the threat of
extraditing major figures charged with corrupt practices; and,
a series of financial system reforms.
These initiatives were based on the recommendations of a special commission
charged with finding solutions to the current political crisis.
Investors are worried that new members of the proposed 'national unity'
cabinet - likely to include opposition and independent figures - will savage
the economic reforms put into effect three years ago, despite Mr Perez's
repeated pledges to the contrary.
So far, the president's March 5 message has produced only a few concrete
results. The head of the Supreme Court announced he was retiring, and the
Minister of Justice, in office for only eight days, resigned indignantly,
asserting she had not been consulted on proposed legal reforms.
Members of both mainstream parties, the president's Democratic Action (AD)
party and the opposition Christian Democrats, began criticising the idea of
a constituent assembly.
Moreover, Mr Perez's pledge to pursue allegedly corrupt figures in and
outside Venezuela put him sharply at odds with a powerful group within his
own party, which fears that important figures from the last administration,
including ex-President Jaime Lusinchi, could face public charges.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Zurich suffers withdrawal symptoms on drug park: The city's
liberal treatment of addicts has left an aftermath that's straining
alliances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been a month since the Zurich authorities drove drug addicts from the
notorious Platzspitz park in the heart of this otherwise tranquil city, but
city leaders are still feeling their way clumsily towards an effective
policy for dealing with their outsize drug problem.
Superficially, the Platzspitz closure has been a success. The hundreds of
addicts who converged on the park every day for drugs, free syringes and
needles have dispersed. The big underworld dealers who really frightened the
authorities have also vanished and the park itself is fenced shut and
deserted.
The police claim that the drug-related death rate in the city in January and
February has tumbled to one from 13 in the same period of last year. The
crime rate has halved in the central districts of the city, but only thanks
to a massive and controversial police presence. Drug prices have soared.
According to Mr Josef Gatzi, deputy chief of the police drug squad, heroin
on the street has jumped from SFr50 (Dollars 33.50) to SFr200 per gram.
The closure of the park came as the city's socialist-green government
finally acknowledged that its decade-long experiment in liberal treatment of
drug addicts had been a failure.
The idea had been that by concentrating the addicts in one place, medical
treatment, counselling and other services could be provided.
But the concentration also attracted big-time dealers and led to soaring
crime rates in central Zurich. Local businessmen eventually became impatient
and demanded that Platzspitz be closed.
It has become apparent in the past few days that the city was also under
fire from the country's powerful banking establishment. Two senior bankers,
speaking at press conferences, have claimed that Platzspitz has been one of
the factors contributing to the widening view abroad that Switzerland is no
longer the stable, well run country it used to be.
When the park closed, the authorities set up a plan for dispersing the
addicts. Those who came from other parts of Switzerland - and they were the
majority - were to be sent home. Those from Zurich were sent to one of
several small shelters established around the city.
That plan seems to have worked well, with only minimal complaints from
residents in the districts where the shelters are located.
However, the shelters are open only at night. Ideas for dealing with the
addicts during the day were more sketchy, with no clear programme or
additional facilities for counselling and rehabilitation.
For example, a bus to dispense methadone was promised by the cantonal
government, but its approval continues to be delayed. The result is that
many addicts have simply moved from Platzspitz to an adjacent run-down
neighbourhood, known as Kreis 5, to try and re-establish a trading centre.
'We are very pleased that Platzspitz has been closed, but it is obvious the
city was not sufficiently prepared about what to do afterwards,' said Mr
Hans Georg Luchinger, president of the Zurich Shopkeepers' Association.
The police have moved into Kreis 5 in force, constantly trying to disperse
the addicts. There have been complaints of excessive harassment, including
confiscation of needles and small amounts of drugs, contrary to official
policy. Addicts staged a protest demonstration in front of city hall two
weeks ago.
All this is straining the political alliance that agreed on closing
Platzspitz. Ms Emilie Lieberherr, the socialist head of the city's social
affairs department and a member of its three-person drug committee, last
week tried to distance herself from what she considers an unnecessarily
brutal implementation of the new policy. 'This situation is bad for the
addicts and bad for the people of Kreis 5,' she said.
Mr Robert Neukomm, head of the police department and another member of the
drug committee, claims that his forces have been instructed not to take away
needles from the addicts.
Ms Lieberherr also complains about the inadequacy of treatment programmes.
She argues that heroin should be provided under medical supervision to the
150 serious addicts in the country, but the federal government is resisting.
Mr Neukomm says that rehabilitation programmes are improving. Addicts are
more inclined to seek help now that the magnet of Platzspitz is no longer
there, he says.

<TEXT>
ASK Europe's ski equipment makers if they would prefer a booming economy or
snow, and they answer without hesitation.
In spite of weak economic conditions in most European countries, Alpine
resorts have enjoyed lively business this season and ski equipment makers
are seeing the beginning of a welcome recovery from a disastrous slump in
the late 1980s.
In sharp contrast to the past four winters, the Alps have been blessed with
ideal weather conditions for skiing - several heavy snowfalls divided by
long sunny spells. The winter olympics in France's Savoy region last month
also gave a fillip to the sport.
According to the Swiss Tourist Office, the number of bed-nights sold in
January was up 5 per cent to 2.6m, with most of the growth attributable to
skiers. Visitors from Germany were up 11 per cent, those from Italy up 19
per cent and those from the UK up 16 per cent over last year's levels which
were depressed by the Gulf crisis.
Worldwide sales of ski equipment look set to grow roughly five per cent,
heavily concentrated in Europe. Producers say the Japanese market has calmed
down after several strong seasons while the North American market is
slumping because of recession and a lack of snow.
Salomon, the French equipment maker, is forecasting sales of 5.8m pairs of
skis worldwide in the year to March 31, 1992, up 5 per cent from the trough
of 5.5m reached in 1990-91, but still well below the 1988-89 peak of 7m
pairs.
This will be enough to enable the company to make a small profit for the
first time in three years. For another French company, Skis Rossignol, the
world market leader in skis, a return to profit is not expected until next
year, but the group's loss in the year to March 31, 1992 is likely to be
only FFr40m, sharply down from FFr140m in the previous year.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Profits under threat on
crumbling pampas - The growing problem of soil erosion on Argentina's grain
lands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems almost unbelievable that Argentina's vast and prodigiously fertile
pampas could ever succumb to soil erosion. In many parts of the pampas the
black topsoil is over a metre deep and the land is so rich that farmers use
little fertiliser, even though they harvest two crops a year. Nevertheless,
a third of the pampas is now affected by moderate to severe soil erosion.
Agronomists say that, while the problem is far from catastrophic in all but
a few small black spots, farmers must change their ways to avoid an
inexorable decline in crop yields. A sustained drop in productivity would be
very bad news for a country that relies on the soyabeans, wheat and beef
produced on the pampas for almost 40 per cent of its exports.
Reliable figures are hard to come by. The Centre for Promotion of Soil and
Water Conservation estimated in 1986 that 13.5m hectares (8.4m acres) of the
pampas - which cover 40m hectares, an area larger than many European
countries - were affected by soil erosion. Furthermore, about one-fifth of
the degraded area was already severely eroded.
Five years earlier, the agriculture department estimated that soil erosion
was costing dollars 100m a year in falling maize yields alone. It added that
it cost a further dollars 20m a year to dredge ports silted up with soil
swept into rivers by rainwater. No effort has been made since to measure the
advance of soil erosion or assess its impact. Experts can only assume that
the problem has grown worse since then.
'Obviously we are not talking about desertification,' says Mr Octavio Prez
Pardo, a government soil erosion specialist. 'By most standards, the soil in
degraded areas is still quite good. But instead of being thick, black and
spongy, the soil looks grey and loses its spring. That is when we warn
farmers they must start looking after their land.'
Degraded soil loses its ability to soak up rainwater. Instead, it courses
across the land, carrying away topsoil and reducing fertility, crop yields
and profits. Incomes diminish, reducing farmers' ability to invest in the
land and combat erosion, locking them into a vicious circle of declining
yields and incomes, leading to permanent erosion in some cases. Soil erosion
has been speeded by a shift in land use since the 1960s, when farmers began
to abandon crop rotation. Crop rotation is an age-old practice in which
different crops are grown in rotation and the land regularly left to lie
fallow and used as pasture. This allows the land to 'rest' and be naturally
fertilised by cattle droppings.
In the 1960s, however, farmers began reducing their cattle herds and
switching to intensive production of soyabeans and wheat in response strong
international demand for grains. To make matters worse, though scientists
are unsure why, soyabeans speed soil erosion.
A similar trend is afflicting Brazil's soyabean belt in the southern states
of Rio Grande do Sul and Parana. Mr Gustavo Grobocopatel, an agronomy
lecturer at the University of Buenos Aires, says that in some badly degraded
areas, farmers have stopped planting maize because it is especially
susceptible to declining soil fertility; they have replaced it with
soyabeans, further accelerating erosion.
Far from declining, however, average national yields have actually improved
since the mid-1980s. This may be because farmers are using more weedkillers
and fertilisers. But Mr Neri Simonetti, a government agronomist, warns that
'you can suppress the impact of erosion for a time with agrochemicals and
you can even increase yields. But in the end it will not work: yields will
come down.' In some prime maize regions, yields are now down by about 10 per
cent.
Efforts to deal with soil erosion have clearly made little headway. Congress
passed a soil conservation law in 1981, offering subsidies to farmers who
adopted conservation techniques. But oftern farmers spent the money on new
cars or paying bills. The subsidies declined as the economy sank into chaos.
In 1989 the government cut off the subsidies altogether.
Agronomists complain that farmers are unwilling to change old habits. In any
case, soil erosion is a problem that builds up slowly and few farmers notice
it. Switching to soil-friendly farming is expensive at first, and the
rewards take time to become apparent. So farmers baulk at the added cost of
contour farming or buying cattle. Officials hope, however, that they will
learn that going easy on the soil will eventually improve yields, raise
income and improve land prices.
However bad the situation may be, it is far from irreversible. Unlike the
arid Patagonian steppes that are threatened by desertifiaction, the Pampas
are still extraordinarily fertile. Argentina began farming the plains less
than a century ago, so the soil is still in comparatively good shape.
Furthermore, enlightened farmers are adopting new techniques, like crop
rotation, contour farming, and no-till farming.
Mr Grobocopatel explains: 'No-till farming is a technique developed in the
United States, in which stubble is left standing after harvest and the next
crop sown directly on top'. This conserves the soil because, unlike
ploughing, it does not disturb its structure. Farmers now use the no-till
system on about 500,000 hectares, ten times the area three years ago.
The main reason for the techniques popularity, however, is its cheapness
rather than its friendliness to the environment. And Mr Simonetti points out
that farmers have to use more environmentally- unsound agrochemicals to
control weeds, which also flourish in untilled, fertile soil.

FT  10 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities gain ground in thin trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINAL pre-Budget trading session in UK equities, also the opening of the
new two-week account in the stock market, saw shares moving forward
confidently, although turnover was restrained ahead of this afternoon's
speech from Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, in the
House of Commons.
Several London-based securities houses expressed the view that the
relatively generous budget which is expected today could set the stage for
gains in the stock market, especially if it triggers an election victory for
the governing Conservative party.
Announcement of the election date is widely expected this week. Mr Ian
Harnett of Strauss Turnbull, the UK securities arm of Societe Generale,
commented yesterday that in four of the last five UK general elections, the
equity market had risen by around 4 per cent between the announcement of the
election date and polling day.
Hopes for an early reduction in UK base rates, while dimmed somewhat by
recent pressures on sterling, also remained in place. Building and retail
shares, all likely beneficiaries of a rate cut, moved higher. But little
attention was paid to the consumer credit statistics for January announced
yesterday.
The market opened lower, reflecting the uncertainties facing it this week,
and the FT-SE 100 Index dipped to 2,522.7 in early trading as dealers backed
away in the face of an inadequate level of business from the big
institutions.
At this level the stock index futures market came in, and a good premium on
the March contract on the Footsie inspired a recovery in underlying
equities. The cash market moved back to the lower end of its current trading
range, brushing off the effects of downward adjustments in a batch of blue
chip stocks to allow for dividend payments.
At best, the market was more than 19 points ahead on the Footsie before it
closed at 2,550.7, leaving a gain on the day of 17.6 points.
Traders were quick to point out that last night's close left the index only
at the low end of its perceived trading range and that trading volume had
not been sufficient to provide much test of market confidence.
Seaq-reported volume of 383.6m shares underlined this point. Friday's total
reached 538.4m shares and reflected retail, or customer, business worth
Pounds 1.1bn; customer business has topped Pounds 1bn on five out of the
past seven trading sessions, indicating a significant improvement in market
profitability.
With the attention now firmly fixed on the domestic political and economic
scene, and Wall Street a mere two points off on the Dow Average in London
hours, the international blue chips lacked direction. Some leading stocks
moved sharply, but a fall in ICI was little more than the ex-dividend
adjustment, while speculative demand for Midland Bank was not regarded as
serious investment activity.
Today brings, in addition to the UK Budget, a test for Wall Street in the
form of the Super Tuesday primaries for the presidential elections. Economic
data on both sides of the Atlantic is likely to play a subdued role this
week, although the US retail sales figures, due on Thursday, will be eagerly
scanned for any signs of a nascent recovery in the economy.

<TEXT>
A SQUEEZE on stock index futures sent the March contract on the FT-SE 100
racing forward, pulling the underlying cash market higher, writes Joel
Kibazo.
The opening level of 2,536 proved to be the low-point of the session, as the
March future contract found sporadic buyers shortly after the opening, with
dealers who had gone 'short' over the weekend trying to cover positions.
That buying gathered momentum around 10am when, combined with orders from
two leading houses, March was squeezed forward to touch 2,552.
The tentative opening on Wall Street initially caused March to relinquish
earlier gains, but its turnround led to a further squeeze in the dying
minutes of the session, with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew reported to be particularly
active.
The March contract closed at 2,574, around 18 points above its estimated
fair value premium to cash, which fell to around 4 for this account.
Turnover remained poor, coming to 4,782 lots.
The traded options market remained dull, with turnover a negligible 17,637.
Volume in the FT-SE 100 index option reached 7,054 lots. Amstrad was the
busiest stock option, trading 2,555 contracts.

Wall Street
THE WEEK started on a subdued note, with equities marking time in a narrow
range as investors remained wary in the absence of any fresh evidence about
the state of the US economy, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended just 6.48 off at 3,215.12 after a
thin New York SE volume of 160.8m shares. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged up
0.77 to 405.21.
The treasury market was equally lacklustre. Although the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond firmed to 101 7/16 , yielding 7.87 per cent in the
afternoon, trading was very quiet throughout the day. Trading in US stock
and bond markets is expected to remain moribund until the publication of
economic data at the end of the week.
Bank stocks regained some of the ground lost last week, when the sector took
a beating on concern over the finances of Olympia &amp; York. The property
developer, owned by Canada's Reichmann family, redeemed part of a commercial
paper programme after a downgrading. Citicorp, one of the most actively
traded issues of the day, improved Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 16 1/2 .
On the big board, most actively traded stocks included Chrysler, unchanged
at Dollars 16 1/8 , American Express, up Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 22, and
AT&amp;T, Dollars  1/8 higher at Dollars 37 7/8 . IBM rose Dollars 1 to Dollars
87 3/8 .
Among other blue chip issues, Merck advanced Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 151
3/8 , Mobil eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 59 1/4 and Sears lost Dollars  5/8
to Dollars 45 1/4 .
Coca-Cola firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 80 1/8 . The company, which is
returning to India 14 years after closing its Indian operations, yesterday
said its share of the international market rose to 49 per cent in 1991 from
46 per cent a year earlier.
KeyCorp, a commercial banking group based in the north-east and
north-western US, weakened Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 on news that it
had agreed to buy Puget Sound Bankcorp for stock. Shares in the Washington
State-based Puget Sound softened Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 36 1/8 . The deal
values Puget Sound at Dollars 807.2m. Non-recurring restructuring charges
related to the merger are estimated at Dollars 70m.
In the secondary market, the Nasdaq composite eased 0.13 to 615.82. Trading
was led by Lotus Development, the computer software company, which gained
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 33 3/4 after Cowen &amp; Co upgraded its near-term
investment rating on the stock to 'buy' from 'underperform'.
Similarly, an upgrading on Celtrix Pharmaceutical from Kemper Securities
sparked interest in the issue, which jumped Dollars 1 to Dollars 11.
In the secondary market, technology issues dominated trading. Apple Computer
dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 63 3/4 but Dell Computer put on Dollars  3/4
to Dollars 37.
Borland International finished Dollars 1 7/8 lower at Dollars 68 1/8 after
Shearson Lehman cut its fourth-quarter earnings estimate for the computer
software group to 20 cents a share from 30 cents.
Canada
TORONTO displayed an easier bias in quiet dealings. The composite index
ended 12.3 down at 3,518.6, while falls exceeded advances by 319 to 276.
Volume slipped to 20.9m shares from Friday's 27.1m.
Ford Motor, up CDollars 1 at CDollars 150, said it is close to a possible
USDollars 1bn deal to make cars at its Oakville, Ontario, plant for use as
taxis in Argentina.
Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded USDollars 4.6bn in Toronto-Dominion Bank
long-term debt, citing 'continued worsening of the bank's asset quality'.
The stock ended CDollars  1/8 down at CDollars 16 3/8 .

FT  10 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling seeks Budget boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN exchange rates moved in tight bands yesterday, with investors
unwilling to commit themselves to either sterling or the dollar before
today's UK Budget, and US economic data later in the week, writes Neil
Buckley.
Weekend opinion polls in the UK continued to suggest that a hung parliament
is a strong possibility after the general election expected on April 9,
bringing a long period of political uncertainty. This has caused widespread
hesitancy to move into sterling.
Yesterday it touched its floor against the top-placed peseta within the
Exchange Rate Mechanism, but rumours of Bank of England intervention seemed
to be unfounded. Against the D-Mark, it dropped as low as DM2.8640 at one
point, from a start of DM2.8655/90, and closed at DM2.8671/76.
Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank, said: 'The market itself
is not looking for anything specific from the Budget. But it will be
watching closely for the reaction of two sets of individuals - the business
community, to determine whether this Budget could spur economic recovery,
and the voters, to see if it can improve the Conservatives' electoral
prospects.'
Dealers have warned that a negative reaction to the Budget from these groups
could place sterling under increasing pressure on the foreign exchanges.
Against the dollar, however, the pound had a better day, closing at Dollars
1.7230, after Friday's Dollars 1.7185. It ended mildly higher in New York at
Dollars 1.7255.
The dollar generally took a rest from last week's exertions, and traded in a
narrow range to close down at DM1.6630, against DM1.6695 previously, but up
at Y131.95 from Y131.75. Later in New York it finished at DM1.6607 and
Y131.92.
Most dealers feel the dollar will become more bullish again after Thursday's
US retail sales figures and Friday's producer prices index. The belief that
the Bank of Japan will soon cut its discount rate of 4.5 per cent is also
weighing heavily against the yen, although the news that a candidate from
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party had been defeated in a Japanese
by-election on Sunday had little effect.
In Tokyo, the dollar had finished at Y131.73 and DM1.6633, against
Y131.80/90 and DM1.6670/80 at the New York close on Friday.
Within the EMS, the Belgian franc was unchanged against the D-Mark even
after Mr Philippe Maystadt, finance minister, said Belgium was considering
letting its short-term interest rates fall below equivalent German rates. Mr
Maystadt said informal talks were taking place between the governors of the
Dutch, Belgian and German central banks.
The D-Mark was unchanged from its opening at around DM4.862/3 per 100
Belgian francs, but slightly up from Friday's DM4.865/7. It was slightly
weaker against the lira and French franc, although it maintained its
position in the EMS, at around 33 per cent above its central Ecu level.

Danish pig farmers and slaughter-houses were able to boast unprecedented
pork exports last year.
Danish exports for 1991 reached a record level of 1m tonnes, an increase of
about 11 per cent on 1990. Sales were valued at DKr20bn (Pounds 1.8bn),
including DKr831m in European Community subsidies.
At the same time, the pig farmers showed an increase in production in 1991
of 4.3 per cent, or almost 700,000 pigs, compared with the previous year.
Increases in demand were seen in all traditional export markets except the
US.
Because of the large drop in the German pig herd, which resulted in an
increase in demand for imports from German slaughter-houses, Danish exports
to Germany rose by 26 per cent on the previous year.
A total of 168,000 tonnes were sold to Germany with a value of DKr3bn.
According to the Danish Federation of Pig Producers and Slaughterhouses, the
boom in exports to Germany is expected to continue through 1992.
Sales to the UK, traditionally the largest export market for Danish pork,
rose by a comparatively modest 1.6 per cent on 1990 to 245,000 tonnes.
Exports to European Community countries as a whole rose by about 10 per cent
to 651,000 tonnes with a value of DKr11bn.
After a particularly bad year in 1990, farmers have managed to recover lost
ground in Japan with an increase in sales of nearly 30 per cent for 1991.
According to the federation this reflects a recovery to 1989 levels rather
than real growth in exports. Sales for 1991 reached 150,000 tonnes with a
value of about DKr4bn.
The only negative development in the Danish success story was a fall in US
sales of 9 per cent to 86,000 tonnes for 1991. The drop was blamed on tough
competition, particularly in the ham market, the falling US dollar and
rising costs at home.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: End to banana quotas urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUOTA CONTROLS on Latin American banana imports to the European Community
should be ended, the Committee of Independent EC Banana Importers and
Distributors has told the EC Commission.
'A quota scheme or an equally restrictive tariff quota would have dire
consequences for European importers, distributors, retailers, community
consumers and the fragile economies of Central America,' the committee says
in a letter to the commission, which is struggling to sort out a banana
regime for the European single market.
The committee represents banana importers, distributors and ripeners from 10
EC countries. It points out that consumers in the Benelux countries and
Germany enjoy lower banana prices and higher per capita consumption than
consumers in the UK, France and Spain, which have protectionist measures to
help traditional suppliers in the West Indies and the Canary Islands.
Recognising that growers from the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of
states will need some form of protection, the committee suggests a
straightforward tariff on Latin American bananas.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Aid needed to build new copper
smelters'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW COPPER smelters are unlikely to be built without the help of government
grants because the financial returns they offer are otherwise unattractive,
says Mr Ken Sangster, technical director of Outokumpu Copper Resources.
The state-owned Finnish mining and metals group announced two weeks ago that
it had shelved its proposed Metcob copper smelter project in Portugal. 'We
didn't like the figures we saw (from a feasibility study) earlier this
year,' says Mr Heikki Solin, OCR's managing director.
When first mooted, it seemed that Portuguese government financial assistance
would be available for the Metcob smelter.
However, 'the money is now needed for other projects with a higher
priority,' says Mr Solin.
Exchange-control difficulties arising from the fact that the smelter would
have been in the European Ecu area while copper is mainly traded in US
dollars, also played a part in the decision not to go ahead, he adds. The
smelter would have been heavily dependent on imported raw material because
it could take no more than half its requirements from the new Neves Corvo
mine in Portugal.
Outokumpu has considered several copper projects over the past few years but
its 60 per cent shareholding in Metcob meant that most attention was given
to that project.
The Finnish group also was among the potential buyers of the former Rio
Tinto Minero copper smelter at Huelva in Spain, now owned by Ercros, a
company controlled by Kuwaiti interests. Mr Solin says that it was not
possible to agree a price, however.
Mr Sangster suggests the 108,000-tonnes-a-year Spanish smelter 'runs well
but needs expanding'.
OCR was established last May as part of a change in Outokumpu's strategy
that sees the group in divisions concentrating on individual metals. Now
that the Metcob project has been dropped, OCR's main interest is in
developing copper mines in Chile, particularly its 100 per cent owned
Zaldivar project.
Its terms of reference do not include Outokumpu's Scandinavian mines or the
smelter at the Harjavalta copper-nickel complex in Finland. Outokumpu is
'examining its options' for the Harjavalta smelter and its decisions
obviously have a bearing on whether or not some of the group's other copper
smelter projects are looked at again.
Three other copper smelter projects are being considered.
Metallgesellschaft, the German group, is involved with various partners in a
Dollars 500m scheme for Indonesia to produce 150,000 tonnes of copper a
year; and Mitsubishi of Japan is considering one at Texas City, Texas, and
one in Thailand. Industry sources suggest that the Thai smelter will be the
first to go ahead while there is a growing possibility that the Texas
project will be shelved, even though Mitsubishi has spent two years gaining
various planning approvals.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD'S PRICE dipped briefly below Dollars 348 a troy ounce in London
yesterday, a psychologically-important level because some technical analysts
suggest the metal will suffer a substantial fall, perhaps to below Dollars
300, if it is conclusively breached.
On this occasion the price recovered to close in London at Dollars 348.90,
down 80 cents from Friday.
'Gold has not been seriously below Dollars 350 an ounce since the mid-1980s,
so chartists have drawn their lines at about Dollars 347.50,' said Mr
Michael Coulson, analyst at stockbroker Durlacher &amp; Company. 'If the price
does not hold at Dollars 347.50, they feel that bear raiders might try to
push the price down another Dollars 20 or so.'
However, Mr Coulson pointed out that gold's price had been falling for the
past 12 years 'so it is a pretty tired bear market. I would not want to bet
big money on trying to push it further down.'
Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, also said yesterday's
price slip was not likely to precipitate a substantial fall. Middle East
gold market participants were out of the market during the Islamic fasting
month of Ramadan, which had just started. In six of the past seven years
during Ramadan, gold's price was 1 per cent lower than in the previous month
and the trading range had narrowed.

STANDARD and Poor's, the credit rating agency, said it had downgraded the

subordinated debt to AA-minus from AA, Reuter reports from New York.
Both ratings are removed from creditwatch, where they were put on February

The action reflects the continued worsening of the bank's asset quality, and
the expectation of a prolonged decline of future profitability levels, S&amp;P
said.
Toronto-Dominion Australia and TD Mortgage Corp ratings were cut to AA from
AA-plus. Toronto-Dominion's A-1-plus short-term rating was affirmed.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts firm as Bank details Pounds 500m in
tap stock issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bond prices firmed yesterday, helped by the strength of the US
Treasury bond market on Friday and the Bank of England's decision to issue a
further Pounds 500m of tap stocks across a wide range of maturities.
The Bank announced yesterday it was issuing: Pounds 100m of 8 1/2 per cent
Treasury stock due 1994; Pounds 100m of 9 3/4 per cent Exchequer stock due
1998; Pounds 200m of 9 per cent conversion stock due 2000; and Pounds 100m
of 9 1/2 per cent conversion stock due 2005. It has also issued Pounds 100m
of the 8 1/2 per cent stock due 1994 and Pounds 100m of the 9 3/4 per cent
gilt due 1998 to the National Debt Commissioners.
Some traders interpreted the tap announcements as a sign that the Bank
expects the gilt market to pick up again in response to today's Budget news.
Last week saw a sharp fall in gilt prices on worries about the government's
heavy borrowing requirement, and volumes in the Liffe gilt futures contract
were low yesterday as the market awaited the Budget announcement.
The Liffe gilt futures contract rose from its opening of 96.18 to 96.21, up
from Friday's close of 96.12. Meanwhile, the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt
due 2003/07 climbed from 114 7/16 to end the day at 114 13/16 .
US TREASURIES firmed through the day, but trading was thin in the absence of
any significant economic news.
In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  23/32 higher at
101 15/32 , yielding 7.86 per cent. The two- and three-year notes posted
gains of  7/32 , while intermediate issues were up about 15/32 . The Federal
Reserve entered the open market to arrange three-day system repurchase
agreements when Fed funds were trading at 4 per cent.
The operation, which adds reserves to the banking system, was widely
expected and did not indicate a change in monetary policy. It was needed to
redress a drop in vault cash and increases in required reserves and currency
in circulation.
Treasuries are expected to be quiet through most of this week. The first
important economic data is scheduled for Thursday, when retail sales figure
for February will be released. Although this is not usually an important
figure, the market is trying to gauge the strength of the economy and a
strong increase would be seen as a clear sign that it was recovering.
JAPAN'S benchmark No 129 issue weakened yesterday - moving against the
market's general direction - with dealers attributing the fall either to a
single large trade or to selling ahead of the World Bank's large global yen
bond issue.
The No 129 due 2000 ended with a yield of 5.43 per cent, having opened at
5.42 per cent. The yield ranged between 5.4 and 5.45 per cent.
In the futures market, the price of the front-month June futures contract
for 10-year government bonds ended up 0.14 at 102.12.
Traders said there were market rumours that the dip in the No 129 could have
been the result of an exercised option on the bond. However, it could also
have arisen from selling of the issue ahead of the World Bank's global bond
issue, which is due to be priced off the No 129 today.
GERMAN government bonds closed slightly higher in dull trade as the market
waited for further news on the wage rounds. The Liffe bund futures contract
opened at 88.46 and closed at 88.52 on a volume of about 20,000 contracts.
Elsewhere in Europe, Dutch bonds closed higher.

10% rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DBS Bank of Singapore has reported better than expected results with a 10
per cent rise in net profits to SDollars 315.3m (USDollars 197m) for 1991,
up from SDollars 286.4m a year earlier, despite slower credit expansion and
softer interbank rates, AP-DJ reports.
However, turnover fell 2.3 per cent to SDollars 2.27bn from SDollars 2.32bn,
while earnings per share were up 5.1 per cent at 62 cents against 59 cents.
DBS, which is maintaining its dividend for the year at 16 cents a share,
said net interest earnings grew by 9.7 per cent at group level and 6.6 per
cent at bank level. The bank's loan portfolio expanded by 13 per cent.
Other income declined by 23 per cent at group level and 9.1 per cent at bank
level. The fall was largely due to lower contributions from investment
banking operations.
DBS Bank is seen as an indicator for the sector's earnings.
Analysts had expected the banking sector to report weak earnings partly
because the financial services sector slowed considerably last year, after
strong growth in 1990. They said the sluggish financial sector was dragged
down by foreign banks, which suffered poor growth in foreign exchange and
offshore activities.

FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Vitro shares fall on
disappointing results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VITRO, Mexico's largest industrial conglomerate, posted net profits for 1991
of 573,000m pesos (Dollars 185m), a 19.3 per cent fall in real terms on
1990's figures.
The results were worse than expected and Vitro's shares, traded on both the
Mexican bolsa and the New York Stock Exchange, fell on the news, bringing
other Mexican stocks down with it.
The company said 1991's results were hurt by a one-off cost of refinancing
the debt held by its US subsidiary Anchor Glass and a 52 per cent increase
in income tax. Operating income, which excludes these factors, climbed to
1,295bn pesos, 0.2 per cent more in real terms than in 1990. Vitro said
operating income had increased thanks to reduction in costs and increased
productivity.
The sales at Vitro rose to 9,281bn pesos, 0.5 per cent more in real terms
than 1990. The increase in the volume of sales was greater, but peso
revenues were hurt by the real appreciation of the peso against the dollar
during 1991, and because Vitro's domestic prices did not rise as fast as the
Mexican inflation rate.
Vitro's revenues from exports reached Dollars 352m, a 15.7 increase over
1990.
Vitro is a monopoly producer of flat glass in Mexico and through its
subsidiary Anchor Glass has 28 per cent of the US glass container market.
The disappointing results suggest the US recession and Mexico's strong
exchange rate policy is beginning to take its toll on the country's large
conglomerates.

FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: France sets price of Elf
Aquitaine stake
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday set the price of this week's sale of a 2.3
per cent stake in Elf Aquitaine, the state-controlled oil group, at a small
discount to the market.
Investors are to be offered 5.78m Elf shares at FFr360 each, which will
bring in FFr2.08bn (Dollars 371m) before expenses for the state.
This is a 2.6 per cent discount on the FFr369.9 at which Elf's shares closed
on the Paris market yesterday and will reduce the government's stake in Elf,
France's largest company, from 53.8 per cent to 51.5 per cent.
The offer price capitalises Elf at FFr90.43bn, representing 9.2 times
historic earnings, a lower price earnings ratio than most leading oil
groups. But it is well over the FFr350.4 at which the shares stood when the
government postponed the sale last December, to await an improvement in the
depressed stock market. The price stood at FFr435 when the sale was
announced in mid-November.
Since its autumn collapse, the CAC 40 index - of which Elf represents 10 per
cent - has recovered strongly, passing the psychological barrier of 1,900 in
late February to end at 1,976.28 yesterday.
The offer will be open from March 10 to March 12, so that the shares can
start trading on Friday, March 13.
There are 5.78m shares in the sale, of which 2.4m will be syndicated
internationally and the remaining 3.38m will be offered to the French
public.
This will bring to FFr3.4bn the amount the French government has raised in
partial privatisations, since the FFr1.4bn collected from the sale of a 25
per cent stake in Credit Local de France in December.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, announced over the weekend that
more state company share sales were on the way and that the income would be
used to fund the job creation measures recently unveiled by Mrs Martine
Aubry, the labour minister.
The government is expecting to collect FFr5.6bn from partial privatisations
this year, according to its 1992 budget. In all cases, the state will keep a
majority stake in public sector companies, said Mr Beregovoy.

<TEXT>
CITIBANK, the US bank, is to combine its asset management businesses into a
new global division - Citibank Global Asset Management  - with total assets
of more than Dollars 55bn, writes Alan Friedman.
The US bank is hiring Mr Neville Bowen, who has served since 1986 as chief
executive of the investment management arm of the London-based Hill Samuel,
as chief executive of the new unit.
The Citibank asset management businesses being brought together include
activities in 31 countries. Around Dollars 20bn of the Dollars 55bn in total
assets comes from individual and private banking clients in the US, while
the institutional portfolio amounts to Dollars 35bn.
Most of the institutional funds under Citibank management are managed from
London, and Mr Bowen is expected to divide his time between London and New
York.
Although Citicorp raised Dollars 102.5m by selling its Citibank Investment
Management unit three years ago, the bank stressed that it remains a player
in the institutional fund management business.
Mr Richard Braddock, Citibank president, said that in merging the activities
into one unit the bank hopes to become 'a formidable force - one of a
handful of truly global investment firms'.
Citibank's investment operations currently include portfolio management,
cash management and a group of mutual funds.
Fleet/Norstar, the New England banking group, is to become a part owner of
the company that operates the NYCE electronic funds transfer network of
automated teller machines.
Fleet/Norstar will join eight other banks in the NYCE system, which is the
largest cash dispenser network in the Northeast.

cleared
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DREXEL Burnham Lambert saga drew to a close yesterday as claimants
against the once high-flying, but now defunct, US investment bank gave their
support to a Dollars 1.3bn 'global settlement plan' and a US judge approved
it.
The aim is to settle the hundreds of civil claims and lawsuits brought
against the investment bank after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in February 1990. Under the scheme, Mr Michael Milken, former
head of Drexel's junk bond department, would contribute another Dollars
500m, while some 200 of his former colleagues would provide Dollars 300m
from their employee partnership interests.
Added to Dollars 100m of insurance money, and the Dollars 400m which Mr
Milken has already paid into a Securities and Exchange Commission
disgorgement fund, this will create a Dollars 1.3bn pool. The money would be
split between the claimants under court and SEC supervision.
Yesterday's approvals came from two federal agencies, the Resolution Trust
Company and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. They had brought
multi-billion dollar suits against Drexel and Mr Milken on behalf of failed
savings and loan associations, which had been Drexel customers.
Last week the FDIC appeared to jeopardise the settlement when it said it
could not approve such a plan without more information about the settling
parties.
However, in court yesterday, the agency's representative said the board had
now approved the deal. Officials explained that additional provisions had
been attached to the agreement providing for the release of some further
information, and allowing the agency to withdraw under certain
circumstances.
The Manhattan court also heard that settling claimants included the
California Insurance Commissioner, who had sued over the collapse of
Executive Life, a large Californian life company which was a Drexel
customer. Also included are the class-action suits on behalf of individual
investors.
The 200 former Drexel employees have yet to sign up on their portion of the
deal, and the judge acknowledged that there was some disgruntlement over how
their relative contributions should be calculated. However, employees who do
not back the scheme and choose to continue litigation will lose the right to
immunity from any Drexel-related suits in the future.
Separately, a bankruptcy court judge was expected to approve the Drexel
'reorganisation' plan. This essentially winds up its affairs, leaving only a
small business to manage the least liquid assets.

TEXAS Instruments has intervened in the legal battle over Intel's efforts to
prevent 'cloning' of its top selling microprocessors, which form the
'brains' of IBM-compatible personal computers.
TI's entry into the fray appears likely to pit two of the largest US chip
makers against one another in the widening legal battles surrounding the
multi-billion dollar market.
TI's intervention stems from patent infringement suits filed a week ago by
Intel against Chips &amp; Technologies, a supplier of semiconductor devices for
personal computers.
In its suits, the latest in a barrage of litigation surrounding Intel's top
selling '386' microprocessor, Intel alleges that a new version of the 386
violates several Intel patents. Intel is seeking a temporary restraining
order to prevent C&amp;T from transferring the microprocessor technology to any
third party.
Chips subcontracts production of these devices to Texas Instruments, one of
the largest US chip makers.
Texas Instruments has a broad patent cross-licensing agreement with Intel
that covers, among others, the patents in dispute in Intel's suit against
Chips, which Chips maintains provides a 'complete defence' against Intel's
allegations.

TRANS World Airlines, the troubled carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn, yesterday
successfully sought permission from the US bankruptcy courts to sell its
international routes between the US cities of Baltimore and Philadelphia and
London, to USAir, another large US airline, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
The Dollars 50m sale was opposed by the City of St Louis, where TWA has its
main hub, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the TWA pilots union.
The PBGC and the Air Line Pilots Association argued the sale should not go
ahead before a clear business plan for the distressed carrier, which filed
for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, was formulated.
But the TWA creditors' committee gave its backing to the deal, subject to
some provisions over how the proceeds could be used.
The USAir deal still requires approval from the Department of
Transportation, although USAir said it hopes to start serving the routes
into Gatwick, in May.

AIOC, a New York-based commodity trader, has joined forces with four
Ukrainian state enterprises and with Bank Mees &amp; Hope, the merchant banking

Ukraine.
The new bank, with initial capital of Dollars 20m, will be called First

Hope who will move from Amsterdam to Kiev.
AIOC is the largest single shareholder, with more than 25 per cent of the

cent of the bank is owned by Promstrojbank, the state-owned bank, plus three
Ukrainian state enterprises.
Mr Alan Clingman, president and majority shareholder of AIOC, said the idea
of forming a bank developed as he and other commodity traders found it
difficult to do business in the Ukraine without any local institutions that

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Pict Petroleum down to Pounds 1.11m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A fall in oil prices pushed turnover at Pict Petroleum down from Pounds
7.06m to Pounds 5.9m in the six months to December 31. That was in spite of
an increase in production from 479,000 to 550,000 barrels.
Profit before and after tax was down from Pounds 3.13m to Pounds 1.11m and
earnings per share were cut from 8.49p to 2.97p.
The Pounds 11.9m raised from the rights issue in November is being used to
fund exploration in the North Sea and overseas.
There is again no interim dividend.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Greggs dips to Pounds 6m on higher turnover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Recession continued to have an adverse effect on the bakery sector and this
resulted in a dip in pre-tax profits at Greggs, the manufacturer and
retailer of bread, confectionery and savoury products, in the 12 months to
December 28.
Taxable profits emerged at Pounds 6.07m (Pounds 7.02m) and were struck on
turnover almost 10 per cent ahead at Pounds 95.5m (Pounds 87m).
Mr Mike Darrington, group managing director, ascribed the profits fall to
'recession, increased competition, a significant escalation in rents and the
progressive impact of the new food hygiene regulations'.
However, Greggs opened 37 new shops and closed 10, leaving the total at 474.
Earnings were down at 36.8p (41.2p) but 'in view of the group's strong cash
position and dividend cover', the final pay-out is lifted to 9.375p (9p) for
a total of 14.125p (13.5p).

CLOSE BROTHERS, the City merchant bank, reported a marginal increase in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.21m to Pounds 6.34m for the six months to
January 31, writes David Barchard.
Earnings per share, however, rose by 13 per cent to 11.56p because of a
reduced tax charge following two acquisitions last year.
Mr Rod Kent, managing director, said that most of the profit centres
reported creditable trading performances and the bank had a good performance
by the standards of the rest of the sector.
The group's loan book increased by 4.5 per cent during the half to Pounds
250m. Mr Kent said that bad debts were at very low levels and provisions
were slightly below those of the last six months. The interim dividend is
raised from 2.8p to 3p.

BALTIC, the leasing and property group, suffered a Pounds 2.9m profits fall
to Pounds 9.1m pre-tax for the year ended December 31 after taking account
of exceptional items.
Asset finance made profits of Pounds 24.7m (Pounds 27m) which Mr Harry
Hyman, finance director, described as a good result in difficult
circumstances. The group is now concentrating on its core-activity of
leasing.
Interest charges declined from Pounds 17.5m to Pounds 14.1m, reflecting
falling interest rates and a drop in borrowings from Pounds 144m to Pounds
122m. Net assets increased to Pounds 70m (Pounds 67m).
Property incurred a loss of Pounds 1.46m compared to a profit of Pounds
1.38m, which included an exceptional provision of Pounds 842,000 relating to
the loss on Spanish property financing.
Turnover fell to Pounds 38.46m (Pounds 52.77m). Fully-diluted earnings
emerged at 14.5p (21.5p). A final dividend of 2.5p makes a 4.33p (4.13p)
total.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Core businesses help Polypipe improve 11%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLYPIPE, the maker of plastic pipes and fittings, yesterday reported a rise
in interim profits from Pounds 5.27m to Pounds 5.85m pre-tax.
The 11 per cent improvement was achieved in spite of taking account of a
loss from newly-acquired Oasis Leisure, the garden furniture maker.
Earnings per share for the six months to end-December rose marginally to
2.54p (2.53p) and the interim dividend is being stepped up by 5 per cent to
0.63p.
Mr Kevin McDonald, the chairman, said the core guttering and waste pipes
business continued to perform well. New acquisitions during the year had
added Pounds 8.3m to sales but had been responsible for a Pounds 400,000
loss at the operating level.
The largest loss was at Oasis, bought from the receivers last March, though
it normally loses before the summer's peak demand season. Polypipe plans to
using Oasis's spare out-of-season capacity to manufacture large products for
the rest of the group.
Group margins had fallen from 15.5 to 12.3 per cent which Mr McDonald hoped
would be reversed at the full year.
The group was ahead of forecasts this year and the chairman said there was a
feeling there had been a slight upturn in the economy.
Polypipe is more dependent on the house refurbishment market so had been
relatively unaffected by the recession in the housing market, Mr McDonald
said.
The group entered the second half with net cash of Pounds 8m.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Dry summer and recession leave Ransomes
Pounds 4.5m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REFLECTING another dry summer and the recession Ransomes, the grass cutting
machinery maker, reported a turnround of Pounds 13.6m to pre-tax losses of
Pounds 4.5m for the year 1991.
The company, which omitted its interim dividend, is also passing the final
payment - shareholders received a total of 6.15p for 1990. The directors
warned that dividends on the convertible preference shares, due next month,
may also be passed.
Mr Bob Dodsworth, chief executive, said the company's bankers, Barclays and
National Westminster remain 'fully supportive'.
Borrowings increased by Pounds 5.5m to Pounds 69.9m by the year end, a
legacy from the 1989 takeover of Cushman in the US and other purchases.
Borrowing facilities have been revised and are secure until the end of
November. The company has given its UK and US assets as security.
Turnover fell to Pounds 146.7m (Pounds 165.2m) and operating profits to
Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 17.9m). The fall in turnover reflected lower sales of
commercial grass machinery and industrial vehicles. As well as climatic
factors, sales to golf courses and local authorities in the UK were also
down.
Consumer machinery sales, mainly Mountfield mowers and Westwood garden
tractors, were flat at Pounds 36m.
Interest charges increased to Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 8.8m) and there were
exceptional costs of Pounds 1.5m from staff cuts in the UK and US. Losses
per share totalled 17.3p (earnings 1.6p).
Ransomes' investment property division contributed operating profits of
Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 600,000) from disposals.
The property portfolio has been revalued at Pounds 34m, down 11 per cent
since 1988. Ransomes said it plans to accelerate disposals.
COMMENT
Ransomes may be regretting its 1989 assessment that the grass was greener in
the US. Borrowings taken on to finance the Cushman takeover look dangerously
high now recession and the weather have conspired to send operating profits
back to mid 1980s levels. Gearing stood at 170 per cent at year end but will
rise above 200 per cent during the company's peak borrowing period. Apart
from a quick rain dance, there is little Ransomes can do at this stage. The
plan to speed up land sales is all very well, but the property market
already has its fair share of forced sellers. Forecast profits for 1992 of
Pounds 3.5m will still translate into a pre-tax loss if the preference
dividends are paid. No dividend on the ordinaries looks likely this year and
shareholders cannot even console themselves with takeover speculation - any
takeover bid would risk reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
because of Ransomes' leading position in the UK lawn mower market. Longer
term, Ransomes has good brands, it has maintained market share and, finances
aside, is prepared for any upturn. The question, therefore, is which comes
first, upturn, rain or disillusioned bankers.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORDAY &amp; CARLISLE, the niche engineer which fought off an Pounds 18m bid
from Dowding &amp; Mills last year, yesterday announced the virtual elimination
of profits for 1991. The dividend is being cut from 7p to 4.5p.
The result - down from Pounds 4m to Pounds 25,000 at the pre-tax level  -
was better than expected as the group had forecast a loss of Pounds 110,000
during the three-month bid battle. Turnover fell by 16 per cent to Pounds
42.8m. Exceptional charges for redundancies had depressed profits by Pounds
684,000.
Further charges of Pounds 1.15m were taken below the line. They included the
Pounds 653,000 cost of fighting off the Dowding bid and a provision for a
leasehold property.
Mr Peter Ryan, chairman of Dan-Air, is to become non-executive chairman,
following the annual meeting. Mr Paul Torday, chairman and chief executive,
said he felt the group needed a more objective role for the chairmanship.
Oldham Signs, where losses had forced the group into the red at the interim
stage, had been returned to profit in the final quarter, said Mr Torday.
Losses for the year totalled Pounds 1m. Mr Torday warned that the order book
for 1992 had fallen back from the fourth quarter.
DMI, the diesel engine and marine business, contributed operating profits of
Pounds 1.8m. Although orders were higher than at the same time last year, Mr
Torday warned that factors such as the decline in world trade activity could
have a bearing on the division's future performance.
Pound for pound, Mr Torday said Elfab Hughes - which makes pressure relief
and safety equipment - had provided a better return on capital employed.
This division contributed Pounds 650,000 at the operating level.
The final dividend was 3p (4.7p), making a total of 4.5p (7p).
The losses per share were 4.58p compared with earnings of 17.85p.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Intel to make PC range for Amstrad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, the UK consumer electronics group hit by the recession in its main
markets, is planning to boost its role as a supplier of professional
personal computers (PCs) to corporate customers.
It is due to announce in Hanover, Germany, tomorrow, the launch of a range
of PCs to be manufactured to its own design by Intel, the world's leading
supplier of microprocessor chips.
The new machines will be based on Intel's most advanced microprocessor, the
80/486, and will carry Intel's trademark as well as Amstrad's label.
Service and support will also be provided by Intel.
Amstrad, which began trading as an audio company and moved into computers in
the early 1980s. It has been successful in marketing word processors and
games computers but it has suffered among corporate customers from its image
as a consumer electronics company.
Profitability has been declining as a result of price cutting among PC
makers, especially at the lower end of the market, and a fall-off in
consumer spending. In the first six months of the current year, the company
suffered its first-ever loss of Pounds 15.18m before tax on sharply reduced
sales of Pounds 196.07m.
The share price, which has been in the doldrums since profits started to
slip, gained 12 per cent to 36p over the weekend on rumours of the Intel
deal.
The new machines will be priced from Pounds 1,400 to Pounds 3,200.
Intel already manufactures PCs for American Telephone and Telegraph, the US
telecommunications group.
Amstrad, which last year announced a colour portable computer, will tomorrow
launch a laptop machine, priced at less than Pounds 2,500 in the UK.

FT  10 MAR 92 / MPs call for an electricity shake-up: All-party committee
says privatisation has not benefited consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMMEDIATE and wide-ranging reform of the electricity market was called for
yesterday by an all-party committee of MPs, which said that privatisation of
the industry had not brought any benefits for consumers.
The electricity industry watchdog, Offer, supported the MPs' view, saying
that 'the lack of effective choice in the market this year is a most
unsatisfactory feature of the present situation'.
The call for reform came from the Commons energy committee in a report
entitled The Consequences of Electricity Privatisation, which found that the
competitive electricity market the government promised at privatisation has
not yet materialised. An important reason for this was the dominant market
position of the two generators created at privatisation, National Power and
PowerGen, it said.
The report argues that Offer 'should take steps as soon as possible to
reduce the dominance of the two generators'.
If more competition has not emerged by 1995, the report said, Offer should
refer the generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The two
generators should also be compelled to offer for sale any power stations
they planned to close. This would stop them from artificially tightening the
electricity market by temporarily closing stations.
The committee said there were few signs that competition in electricity
generation was developing. Although many new gas-fired stations were being
planned by independent generators entering the market, around half would not
have to compete on price because they had secured long-term, fixed price
contracts to sell their power to regional electricity suppliers who would
sell on to captive consumers. Meanwhile, these new stations would force
existing coal stations which produced cheaper electricity to close.
It was not clear, the energy committee said, how Offer could compel regional
electricity companies to refund customers if they had sold uncompetitive
power in this way.
But it recommended that Offer should immediately scrutinise all the deals
between regional companies and independent power stations.
The report also called for urgent reforms to the pool, or wholesale
electricity market. It said that although the pool was supposed to set a
competitive electricity price, most electricity was sold outside the pool in
contracts, and the contracts market was neither transparent nor genuinely
competitive.
The MPs' report was broadly supported by Offer, which published its annual
report yesterday.
It said that although large electricity customers had enjoyed price cuts
last April, this year they faced significant increases, and many were having
difficulty obtaining contracts to buy electricity at all.
Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, defended privatisation which he said
had brought price cuts of 10 per cent to three quarters of industrial
customers last year, while nearly a third had obtained reductions of over 20
per cent.

FT  10 MAR 92 / US bankers to aid Russia on debt
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is
leading a delegation of senior US bankers to Moscow this week to advise the
Russian government on financial reform and direct foreign investment.
The visit marks an intensification of Mr Corrigan's informal role in helping
President Boris Yeltsin and his advisers to restructure and modernise
Russia's banking system and financial markets.
The New York Fed chief will take part with 15 executives from banks such as
JP Morgan, Citibank, Bank of America, Chemical Banking and Chase Manhattan
in the latest in a series of symposiums aimed at finding new ways to
stimulate more direct foreign investment in Russia.
Although Mr Corrigan cannot act as an official adviser to Mr Yeltsin, the
two men are understood to have developed a close personal rapport that is
resulting in growing assistance for Moscow from New York Fed officials.
Meanwhile, Mr Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve Board chairman, has
been invited back to Moscow on March 21 to discuss with Russian officials
his possible role as an adviser on banking and economic reform.
It is understood he may help the Russian government in its relations with
the Group of Seven industrialised nations, and in particular advise on the
restructuring of Russia's external debt.
Mr Corrigan is expected to open the Moscow meeting on Thursday.
Among the issues likely to be covered will be mergers and acquisitions, debt
trading, privatisation and the raising of funds on international capital
markets.
Leyla Boulton adds from Moscow: Representatives of the former Soviet
republics are due to meet in Moscow in Thursday to try to hammer out a
compromise for repaying a foreign debt exceeding Dollars 60bn. Such a
compromise is aimed essentially at reconciling Russia and Ukraine.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Three ports sold to staff for Pounds 78m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THREE of Britain's biggest trust ports
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tilbury, Medway and Clyde  - are to be sold to their managers and employees
for a total of Pounds 77.7m, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary,
announced in the Commons yesterday.
But Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, warned that an incoming
Labour government might overthrow the decision to privatise these and other
ports formerly run by self-governing trusts.
Mr Prescott told MPs: 'We reserve the right, where possible, to review these
privatisation deals to ensure that the national interest and employees'
interests have been properly taken into account.'
The privatisation of the three ports follows the controversial sale of Tees
&amp; Hartlepool - the first trust port to be privatised  - to a consortium
called Teesside Holdings for a price of Pounds 180m. That sale provoked
uproar because the port went neither to its managers and employees, who had
expected preference in the sale, nor to the highest bidder - Maritime
Transport Services, operator of the Thamesport container terminal in Kent.
Yesterday Mr Rifkind emphasised that the management/employee buy-out teams
had been the highest bidders for all three ports now being sold.
The buy-out team at Tilbury is acquiring Britain's biggest cargo port for
Pounds 32m. It fought off one other bid, believed to have been Pounds
500,000 less, from Maritime Transport Services, which had earlier dropped
out of the bidding but had been encouraged to re-enter by the Department of
Transport.
The price is not directly comparable with the Pounds 180m paid for Tees &amp;
Hartlepool because Tilbury is believed to have made pre-tax profits of only
Pounds 2.2m in 1991 and all the proceeds are going to the previous owners,
the Port of London Authority.
In Tees &amp; Hartlepool's case, the sale proceeds were split between the port
and the government, so half the proceeds reverted to the buyer. In addition,
Tees &amp; Hartlepool had cash assets of Pounds 35m and made profits of Pounds
9m last year.
Medway made profits of Pounds 3.87m last year. The buy-out team, which bid
Pounds 29.7m, faced no competition after Maritime Transport Services dropped
out of the bidding.
Clyde, which made losses of Pounds 790,000 last year, is going to its
managers and employees for Pounds 26m following the defeat of a competing
bid from Regis &amp; Regis, a local property company.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Export insurance premiums cut by up to 50%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK government-backed export insurance premiums for sales to about 50 markets
are to be cut by up to 50 per cent. The move will be regarded by many of
Britain's leading exporters as a significant climbdown in a long-standing
row over the cost of export credit cover.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, minister of state for trade, revealed in a parliamentary
answer yesterday that the first annual review of insurance premiums based on
the controversial Portfolio Management System (PMS) has made it clear 'that
current premium rates need adjusting to reflect changes both in trading
patterns and in the creditworthiness of various markets'.
Under PMS, which is a Treasury model for measuring risk, the cost of
premiums ranges from an effective rate of as little as 2 per cent of the
value of a contract, up to almost 17 per cent for a country such as India.
For Malaysia, where premiums have been over 5 per cent, the cut will reduce
rates to around 3 per cent, while for South Africa rates will fall from
almost 8 1/2 per cent to around 7 per cent.
It is understood that rates for Singapore and Venezuela are to be cut by
almost a half, while rates for Thailand, Malaysia, Hungary, Colombia,
Mexico, Iran and Oman will fall by about 40 per cent. The premium rate for
Hong Kong will be cut by around 20 per cent.
Mr Sainsbury said that in the 20 main markets of exporters who most need
long term credit cover, cuts will average about 20 per cent. Mr Sainsbury
said the cuts, due to come into effect on April 5, were the result of a
normal annual procedure under which PMS is reviewed.
He pointed to four factors which have made the cuts possible: economies had
performed better than expected; economies in the Third World were being
managed better; the balance of business being done by exporters in low-risk
markets was greater than expected; export credit agencies in other countries
had moved more slowly than hoped in raising premium rates to bring them into
line with the UK.
The PMS system was imposed by the Treasury on the Export Credits Guarantee
Department in May last year. The government-controlled ECGD provides medium
and long-term insurance cover for exporters against the risk of non-payment.
PMS was aimed at imposing an even stricter discipline in linking the cost of
export credit cover with the level of risk involved in a contract.
It resulted in steep increases in the cost of export insurance, and led to a
deluge of protests from contract exporters who insisted it gave overseas
competitors an unfair price advantage.
Most affected were companies such as GEC, Rolls-Royce, Trafalgar House,
Balfour Beatty, Babcock and Foster Wheeler, which are involved in large,
long-term overseas contracts.

FT  10 MAR 92 / All for one glass, and one glass for all: Jewish settlements
in the West Bank and Gaza are a central Israeli election issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'If I am negotiating with you over a glass of water and all the while you
are drinking from it, there comes a point when there is nothing left to
negotiate' - Mr Sari Nusseibeh, a senior Palestinian leader in Jerusalem,
talking about Israel's settlement of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The Jewish settlement of Karnei Shomron, straddling three hilltops in the
northern West Bank between the Arab towns of Nablus and Kalkilya, is in a
bit of mess these days. There are mud and bulldozers, concrete and cement
mixers and ranks of fast-rising new houses - hundreds of them.
Karnei Shomron was established in 1977, shortly after Mr Menachem Begin, the
former prime minister who died yesterday, first came to power pledging to
settle masses of Jews throughout 'the land of Israel'. Today, it is home to
4,500 people. But not for long. No fewer than 1,100 dwellings are under
construction in the settlement, which, its leaders say, will enable the
population to grow to 10,000 by the end of next year.
The settlement is an impressive, but not isolated, example of the growth in
Mr Begin's settlement programme in the occupied territories. This initiative
has been undertaken over the past two years by the government of Mr Yitzhak
Shamir, the prime minister and successor to Mr Begin as leader of the
right-wing Likud party.
Mr Ariel Sharon, the housing minister, makes no secret of the intention to
complete what Mr Begin started by settling so many Jews in the West Bank and
Gaza that the Palestinian aim - of reclaiming the land lost in the 1967 Six
Day War through the current Middle East peace talks - is rendered
impossible.
But the government's zeal for explosive settlement growth is coming under
fire in the campaign for the June 23 general election.
The opposition Labour party under Mr Yitzhak Rabin, its newly elected
leader, is accusing the Likud party of endangering the country's long-term
stability and prosperity through its ideological and economic commitment to
the settlements.
For months, the US administration of President George Bush has been pressing
Mr Shamir to freeze the settlements, calling them an obstacle to the peace
process. Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, has refused to give the
go-ahead for Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees requested by Israel to help it
settle hundreds of thousands of Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet
Union unless settlements are curbed.
So far, this US strategy has not worked. In the metaphor of Mr Nusseibeh,
the Palestinian negotiating team's research co-ordinator, Mr Shamir has gone
on gulping from the glass of water as fast as he can swallow.
Mr Sharon said last month that 22,000 houses had been under construction
since 1990 in the West Bank and Gaza, twice the previously existing number.
The Jewish population in these areas has risen to about 100,000 from about
60,000 five years ago and from fewer than 10,000 when Likud came to power in
1977.
Half the land in the West Bank and one third of Gaza have been designated
for Israeli use. The government plans to double the Jewish population within
a few years. These figures do not include the 120,000 Jews living in Arab
east Jerusalem, also captured in 1967, where large-scale expansion is also
under way.
Ms Sondra Baras, an immigrant from Cleveland, Ohio, a decade ago and now
spokeswoman for Karnei Shomron, says the word 'settlement' has become a
misnomer. 'It conjures an image of small outposts of mobile homes and a few
people. Actually what you have now are towns and cities. You cannot just
evacuate and hand back towns and cities. You can't just toss out hundreds of
thousands of Jews.'
However, a significant part of Israeli opinion has long dissented from the
drive to settle. What is different now is that circumstances have combined
to make the issue an important election battleground, on which Likud looks
vulnerable.
For while the government has been pouring money and energy into the
settlements, the economy in Israel 'proper' has come unstuck under the
weight of immigration.
For four of the five months to February, the economy showed negative growth.
Unemployment is almost 11 per cent. Largely as a result, immigration of
Russian Jews, an historic Zionist aspiration, has slowed significantly. The
solution was regarded to be the large-scale cheap foreign borrowing that
would be made possible by the US loan guarantees. But Mr Shamir's stance on
settlements has put that in jeopardy.
The Labour party, re-invigorated after a long spell in the doldrums by Mr
Rabin's accession, has been quick to offer an alternative. Mr Rabin says he
would freeze most settlements, commit the government to giving up most of
the West Bank and Gaza in negotiation and thus open the way both to peace
and economic recovery.
Mr Gad Ya'acobi, a senior Labour MP and former minister, says Labour's
proposal would ensure approval of the US loan guarantees. It would save the
Shk3bn (Dollars 1.3bn) a year currently being spent on the settlements which
Labour would freeze. And, according to Mr Ya'acobi, the proposal would be
worth a further Dollars 4bn a year to the economy  - the result, for
example, of the lifting of an Arab boycott on trade with Israel. (Some Arab
countries have said they will end their boycott if there is a settlement
freeze.)
These estimates may be inflated, but Mr Ya'acobi's main point remains. 'The
main popular issues in the election will be economic and social. Many
Israelis are understanding for the first time the link between the ability
of Israel to solve these economic problems and the stopping of the
settlements and the Likud policy on peace and security,' he says.
From the point of view of the Palestinians, who see the Likud settlement
drive as the biggest threat to their aspirations, a Labour success in the
election would be welcome, but not unreservedly so. Labour, after all, was
the party in power when the settlement effort began after 1967.
Mr Rabin has been careful to distinguish between those he calls 'political'
settlements, which he would halt, and those he designates vital to Israel's
security, which he would not. The latter category includes those of the
Jordan Valley, those around Jerusalem, including Ma'ale Adumim, the biggest
of all settlements, and all in east Jerusalem - a far cry from Palestinian
demands for a complete freeze.
What is more, many Israelis believe that the existing level of settlements -
ironically built by up to 20,000 Palestinian labourers - is such that it has
already precluded any realistic chance of an Israeli withdrawal from the
territories.
Some of the settlers themselves, however, do not see it that way. They have
heard even Mr Shamir say that, although he opposes any change in their
status, the settlements will eventually be the subject of negotiation.
One settler, Ms Audrey Gerber, in Karnei Shomron readily admits to being
worried about their future status. 'Everything is up in the air right now,'
she says. Her friend, Ms Drora Golloway, agrees: 'Whatever government takes
over, I'm worried about what will happen.'
Ms Sondra Baras adds: 'We no longer feel they are going to raze us to the
ground, things have gone too far for that. But there is an insecurity - that
we will stay here but not feel secure; that the Arabs would get more control
over our lives than we think is safe.'
What they worry about is that the current peace negotiations - especially
under a Labour government - could lead to a deal under which Jews are
allowed to stay in their settlements, but under the jurisdiction of a
Palestinian authority.
The Palestinian stance is that all the settlements should be evacuated and
repopulated with Palestinian refugees. But Mr Nusseibeh admits that some
arrangement under which the settlers would stay could be acceptable, as long
as they were under Palestinian administration. The Palestinian hope would be
that a lack of motive to stay and financial incentives to leave would lead
to a shrinkage in settler numbers.
So far, however, the peace talks that began in Madrid last October have come
nowhere near such an arrangement. The Likud proposal to date is that the
settlers would remain firmly under Israeli jurisdiction, out of the scope of
the limited offer of Palestinian autonomy.
All eyes, therefore, are on the June election to see if the Israeli
electorate will dictate a change. Mr Nusseibeh says: 'In order to proceed,
we have to have either a change in the position of the Israeli government,
or a change in the government itself.'

South Africa's ultra-right Conservative Party is fighting for its life in
next week's referendum; should it or should it not end apartheid? But one
can be forgiven for wondering whether all hearts are really in it; a leading
Conservative MP, Koos van der Merwe - the party's spokesman on many a
television debate - has placed a private bet that his party will lose the
referendum by a large margin.
The Johannesburg office of the BBC is running a sweepstake on the poll,
which pits the ruling National Party in the 'yes' camp, against the
Conservatives who urge a 'no' vote. Van der Merwe bet that the Yeses would
have it, by 58 to 42 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sounds like BP chairman Bob Horton is living up to his axeman image.
One of his first acts on taking over the controls of Standard Oil in 1986
was to cancel plans to install a 48-foot tall pink and maroon Claes
Oldenburg sculpture outside Standard's Cleveland headquarters. To Horton it
looked too much like a rubber stamp and, deary me, that was not the sort of
message he wanted to project.
Now Observer hears that the highlight of the BP oil sculpture exhibition in
1990 - opened by the then arts minister David Mellor  - has been made
redundant.
A specially commissioned two ton cube sculpture by Nigel Hall which was
supposed to go outside BP Oil's new headquarters has to be found a new
resting place. Times are tough at BP and the company seems far more anxious
to promote itself as a lean, mean money machine rather than an over-generous
patron of the arts.
Offers over Pounds 50,000, please, to Bob Horton, Britannic House, 1
Finsbury Circus, London EC2.

Unlike British Airways' dalliance with KLM, the protracted affair between
Air France and Sabena is still on schedule for the altar.
Lunching together in Paris, Sabena president Pierre Godfroid and Air France
chairman Bernard Attali both attested that their troth remains plighted,
although there will probably be a trial marriage in which the French partner
takes a big minority share in the Belgian before the two parts beat equally
as one.
Attali noted that long engagements often make happy marriages. Godfroid said
he hoped the last political hurdles in Belgium would soon be overcome so
that the wedding bells may ring.
One of the snags from the French point of view, however, is what might be
called a heavy father-in-law problem.
Under Sabena's statutes, King Baudouin of the Belgians has veto rights on
decisions affecting the airline. As good republicans, the French want the
statutes changed and the regal veto jettisoned.

Why did the BBC suddenly lose its nerve about showing its economic editor's
analysis of the causes of the UK recession on last night's Panorama?
Whatever one might think about Jay, former son-in-law of a Labour prime
minister and UK ambassador to Washington, he is no slouch when it comes to
economics. Perhaps this was the problem. He knows so much that translating
it into TV pictures isn't easy.
Whether one subscribes to the conspiracy, or cock-up, theory about the
programme, it is a bizarre affair. Jay is an old colleague of John Birt, the
BBC's next director-general, and they pioneered a more in-depth approach to
current affairs coverage while working on Weekend World at LWT. Samir Shah,
the BBC boss who axed the programme, is another Birt protege from his old
LWT days.
Meanwhile, if Panorama - the BBC's flagship current affairs programme -
cannot tackle such central historical subjects before the election campaign
has officially even started, what are the chances of the broadcasters really
testing the politicians once the race is on?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As everyone agrees, Norman Lamont today has very little room for manoeuvre
on interest rates. In practical terms, the Bundesbank holds the key.
So it is appropriate that the Budget speech coincides with the arrival in
London of Karl Thomas, one of the most influential members of the German
central bank's policy-making council, for discreet chats with Whitehall and
City eminences.
The softly-spoken Thomas is one of the few members of the Bundesbank council
with practical as well as theoretical understanding of monetary policy. Now
president of the Hesse bank - one of 11 regional central banks whose chiefs
sit on the council - he previously headed the Bundesbank's department
dealing with monetary and credit affairs.
On his visit, he will be talking with both Treasury economic secretary John
Maples and Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank of England. And besides
pleading for understanding for the Bundesbank's tough interest-rate
policies, he'll be banging the drum for Frankfurt as headquarters of the
proposed European central bank.
Even so, the Bundesbank will not be so crass as to offer the Treasury any
pre-Budget advice. Thomas will not be seeing Maples until after Lamont's
statement is well out of the way.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Arts: Manon Lescaut - La Scala, Milan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost exactly a year after its triumphant premiere in Turin on February 1,
1893 Puccini's opera had a successful run of 19 performances. It was revived
in 1909, then dropped until the historic Toscanini interpretation, first
heard on December 26 1922 and repeated almost every season until 1929, the
year of the conductor's resignation. After Toscanini's departure,
productions become rarer; from the end of the First World War until a few
days ago there had been only three.
So the new Manon Lescaut in Milan was eagerly anticipated. Actually, it was
announced over two years ago, for the 1990-91 season, to be staged by Pierre
Romans. But the production was postponed and, before he could mount the
work, Romans died. Meanwhile, however, his collaborators Denis Fruchaud and
Christian Gase had designed, respectively, costumes and sets; so the opera
house found itself with the empty shell of a staging, but without someone to
fill it with stage life. La Scala appealed to Jonathan Miller, who agreed to
take over. It was a generous gesture: few producers with a reputation - and
a distinct personality - like Miller's would have been willing to step into
another's already defined place, renouncing a priori any thought of total
control.
In the event Miller's hand was almost nowhere evident. In the first act, the
chorus milled about as usual, acting like a chorus; the gamblers, stage
left, looked at the conductor and not at their cards. There was no focus, no
rapport among the singers, no feeling that anything significant - like
falling in love, eloping  - was taking place. In the second and third acts,
the staging gained vitality, but still never ventured beyond the most
predictable conventionality. What can be done with the fourth act? You
imagine the producer saying to the singers: stagger for a while, then drop.
The Manon and the Des Grieux at La Scala staggered well beyond the call of
duty, and the hero, towards the end, dropped carefully, teasingly just
beyond the soprano's reach. I attended the second performance, for which
Lorin Maazel's place on the podium had been taken by La Scala's house
conductor Armando Gatto. According to reports, Maazel had been booed on
opening night after a chilly reading. Gatto began as if he were trying to
set a speed record, making the orchestra shrill and nasty. Later, he settled
down to more acceptable tempos, but the sound never became seductive. And he
allowed the singers to dawdle; rhythms became aleatory.
The matronly Nina Rautio has a warm, supple voice, with nothing youthful
about it. She sang her second act aria with style and intelligence and, in
her death scene, she was - finally  - moving. Peter Dvorsky is a known
quantity: big voice, ringing notes, no idea of pathos (his 'Donna non vidi
mai' was loud and assertive); but he is a presence. Gino Quilico's Lescaut
supplied the elegance that was elsewhere missing; too bad Puccini didn't
give him more to do.
The sets and costumes looked cheap. In the first act, the chorus all dressed
in the same colour - the reddish beige of the set  - draining the scene of
precisely the quality it should have: variety. Geronte's mansion was barren,
and the Le Havre harbour also seemed unnecessarily sombre. For the last act,
a chalk cliff ran along one side of the stage: it made the singers look
smaller, but still not moribund.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Arts: BBC Symphony Orchestra/Hilliard Ensemble - Barbican
Hall/Westminster Abbey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS and MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the Barbican continues to pat itself on the back for the triumphs of its
first ten years, the BBC Symphony Orchestra made a second visit to the
celebrations. Their immaculately delivered programme on Thursday, conducted
by Oliver Knussen, was fresh, enterprising and not really festive at all; it
sandwiched the premieres of works by Colin Matthews and Knussen himself
between Sibelius's Luonnotar (sung with perceptive fluency by Lucy Shelton)
and Skryabin's overripe Prometheus (with David Horne as solo pianist).
Broken Symmetry, the BBC commission from Matthews, proves to be a 20-minute
orchestral scherzo, a virtuoso musical machine of threatening power which is
continually primed and propelled by the percussion section. That Matthews
has managed to sustain such a span of fast music with scarcely a pause for
breath is a feat in itself; its sequence of trios and reprises, drastically
foreshortened when they re-emerge in reverse order, careens through the
musical landscape in a sequence of vivid, violent images. The gestures are
constantly varied, arresting - eruptions of jagged rhythmic unisons, Rite of
Spring stampings complete with braying horns, intricate, tightly geared
clockworks spread through the full orchestra; just occasionally also poised,
lyrical melodic lines are threaded in and out of the teeming textures.
Knussen's Whitman Settings first emerged in a version for voice and piano,
which Lucy Shelton introduced at last year's Aldeburgh Festival. None of the
four songs lasts more than a few minutes, yet they pack in an astonishing
range of emotional and vocal nuance. The orchestrations (made especially for
the Barbican concert) enhance that sense of concentration, with wonderfully
lucid colours drawn from a vast ensemble; each song seems to define its
sound world within a couple of bars, compressed into a phrase or a couple of
chords. They are beautifully achieved little songs, brought off with the
lightest of touches.
On the same evening, a huge audience was drawn to Westminster Abbey to hear
the Hilliard Ensemble, plus additional choir, organ and small instrumental
ensemble under Stephen Jackson, offer their celebrated account of Arvo
Part's Miserere (1988-89).
These same performers first gave the work its premiere, and then made of it
an internationally best-selling record (on the ECM label). It was
instructive to hear the Miserere in the abbey spaces, and to note the
unforced eloquence, security and devotion of all its singers and players.
This is music of fearfully exposed spareness, providing no bolt-holes for
sloppy intonation or escape-routes for rhythmic looseness, and it was here
delivered with that peculiarly impressive confidence which carries an air of
absolute naturalness.
Part's mature music, of which this is an important example, defines a new
post-modernist category - 'faith-minimalism'. The message is uttered
entirely in musical gestures, delicately shaped and often repeated: in this
case, vocal lines (solo or concerted) stuttering off into despairing
silences, then timorously re-launched, often with equally hesitating
instrumental punctuation.
Contrasts of timbre are slowly layered; an atmosphere of agonised meditation
suffuses the long sequences and large block-shapes of the structure. For
those able to fall prey to Part's muse, the experience must be an
enthralling one; for anyone, like myself, who remains resolutely unengaged,
the Miserere proves a hollow package - almost entirely devoid of content,
both admirably sincere and desperately enervating.
Thursday's concert, the second of a current seven-stop Hilliard tour
(organised by the Contemporary Music Network), also featured music by
another of today's leading Eastern European faith-minimalists, Henryk
Gorecki. John Casken's new, short madrigal for four voices, Sharp Thorne,
provided a moment of blessedly welcome relief from the prevailing mood of
elevated repetitiousness. An interweaving of a modern poem (by Sylvia
Townsend Warner) and one from the 15th century, it poses hard-edged
questions about the Christian faith in music at once richly harmonised and
packed with harshly vivid detail in each vocal line.

<TEXT>
IT appears the Conservatives will have to embark on their general election
advertising blitz without the free use of Imperial Tobacco's poster sites,
David Owen writes.
Mr Peter Middleton, the Bristol-based company's sales and marketing
director, said yesterday that it had 'no plans' to repeat the generosity it
showed in the 1987 general election campaign.
Then, the group - a cornerstone of the far-flung Hanson empire - made
several hundred of its 2,500 permanent sites available to the Tories free of
charge.
Mr Middleton said it was 'highly unlikely' Imperial would hand the sites
over this time, although it had not yet been asked. The company had its own
commercial interests to pursue, he added.
After the Budget, he suggested, Imperial would have its own important brand
messages to communicate.
Hanson has been a highly visible Conservative supporter over the years,
contributing Pounds 652,000 to the party's coffers between 1979 and 1990,
according to figures compiled by the Labour party.
In 1990 alone the group's contribution to the Tory cause totalled Pounds
80,000.
This put it fourth in the list of corporate givers to the Conservatives for
that year behind United Biscuits (Holdings), the food manufacturer,
Allied-Lyons, the brewing and drinks group, and P&amp;O, the shipping company.

Campaign Profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FAVOURITE story of Mr Des Wilson, Liberal Democrat campaign director, is
of the night in wartime New Zealand when his father fired a gun mounted in
case of Japanese invasion near the family's seaside home.
Alas, the suspicious ship his father was aiming at was not Japanese and the
town was deprived of vital supplies as the frightened captain fled.
Mr Wilson, who came to England more than 30 years ago, is hoping this week
to launch an onslaught of equal ferocity and panache on the British
political system. Liberal Democrats pray his targeting is a little more
successful.
Extrovert, enthusiastic and excitable, Mr Wilson is not always trusted by
his Liberal Democrat colleagues. He is not elected to parliament or party
and is accountable only to Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader.
If the campaign is judged a success, Mr Wilson will take the plaudits. If it
fails, he will be the fall-guy.
With his youthful toothy smile looking ever more misplaced on his ruddy
middle-aged face, the fast-talking 51-year-old Mr Wilson almost goes out of
his way to court controversy, flashing his independence within a party more
used to procedural propriety.
'I never read constitutions in a party. I never go on any committees,' he
says. 'To people who have devoted their lives to constitutions, this is
extremely frustrating.'
He is sociable and generous, a tease with a distinctive antipodean twang,
perhaps happiest at a restaurant table after a hard day's politicking,
struggling with his glasses to examine the label on a New Zealand
Chardonnay. But he insists on remaining the outsider, refusing to conform to
'club rules'.
Addressing the Liberal Democrats' spring conference at Glasgow on Saturday,
the electricity generated came almost as much from notoriety as from
familiarity or warmth.
'He has a lot of the lovable rogue about him,' one Liberal Democrat
prospective parliamentary candidate says.
Mr Wilson knows he has yet to recover from the flak he received for his
handling of the Alliance parties' campaign in the 1987 election -
particularly his failure to stop the public and private clashes between the
leaders of the two parties, Dr David Owen and Mr David Steel. His infamy was
exacerbated by his book on the inside story of the election.
Liberal Democrat MPs, most of whom will be seen far less on television
during the campaign than Mr Wilson, are curiously circumspect. 'He is an
excellent campaign director - and you can quote me as saying that,' one said
tersely before changing the subject.
Mr Wilson's greatest asset is his instinctive campaigning zeal. His eclectic
style dates from school days in Oamaru, New Zealand, when he read through
almost the entire stock of the town's public library, picking up an
encyclopaedic knowledge of cricket and rugby and a scratch briefing on
history and politics.
One of six children, his father ran a house-painting company, and his mother
was a nurse. After leaving school, he became a journalist and arrived in
England at 19, lured by the lights of Fleet Street.
The move to professional campaigning was inspired by a 1960s Kennedy-esque
'ask what you can do for your country' righteousness.
He set up Shelter, the charity for the homeless, taking housing to the top
of the political agenda. Subsequently he has campaigned - with notable
victories - for lead-free petrol, against tobacco sales to children, for
freedom of information, and against pollution.
The breathless dynamism with which he throws himself into his work is
legendary. But there is no career plan or sense of direction. Until recently
he spent weekday nights searching for a cheap London hotel to sleep,
returning to his wife in the country only at weekends. He has written a
low-brow novel, Costa del Sol, aimed at airport bookshelves, to satisfy his
impulsiveness. Another novel is in the pipeline.
Most comfortable when in total charge, he refuses to be paid in his current
post. That means he cannot become a party servant - and also saves expense
for a cash-strapped political party. But taking on such responsibility makes
personal unpopularity inevitable, he believes, given his job of targeting
the most winnable seats. 'Every time you say 'no', there is someone else who
thinks you are a dictator beyond belief,' he says.
He refuses to admit to a temper and dismisses suggestions that he is prickly
under pressure, but to say the least he does not suffer fools gladly.
In spite of his impeccable sense of public duty, Mr Wilson is not a detailed
policy man and is far from an intellectual. He is on safest ground with
party representatives when - as on Saturday  - he makes rabble-rousing
speeches with negligible policy content.
Colleagues fear that if he goes much further under the heat of television
lights, carefully prepared policy positions may be wrecked.
So far, however, he has focused on countering charges that a Liberal
Democrat vote is a wasted vote, and on claiming a moral ground for the party
above the negative Labour and Tory clashes, by calling for an overhaul of
the political system.
Mr Wilson has made no predictions of how well his party will fare.
Realistically he can expect little advance on the current total of 22 MPs -
and possibly some losses  - but with a share of the vote of, perhaps, around
20 per cent.
If the outcome is much worse, and Liberal Democrats blame the national
campaign, Mr Wilson will find the retaliation targeted at him.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory MP quits after 'incident' -
News in Brief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN AMOS, Conserv-ative MP for Hexham in Northumberland and chairman of
the northern group of Tory MPs, announced last night he would not stand in
the general election.
He said it would be 'in the best interests of my constituents, the
Conservative party and the re-election of John Major that I do not accept
the re-nomination of my constituency association.'
His decision follows what he described as an 'incident' in London on
Saturday when he was cautioned by police.
Mr Amos had a majority of 8,066 over the Liberal Alliance candidate at the
1987 election.
*****
TRANSPORT: The allocation of Pounds 1.24bn government spending on road
building and maintenance next year, including 24 new road schemes, was
announced yesterday by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, as he
claimed that a Labour government would mean a 'road block'.
Announcing the division of the funds - Pounds 760m on new roads and Pounds
480m on maintenance - Mr Rifkind put particular emphasis on the programme of
bypasses which, he said, would be put at risk by a Labour government's plans
for a six-month moratorium on new projects.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said yesterday's announcement
included roads on which work had originally been scheduled to begin in the
current year.
*****
BANKING: A possible Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into Britain's
banks was raised by the Liberal Democrats yesterday, as the party unveiled a
package of proposals designed to help small businesses.
Mr Nicol Stephen, spokesman on small businesses, said an MMC inquiry would
be the 'obvious next step' if banks failed to improve service to
small-business customers.
He also pledged to introduce an ombudsman for the commercial banking sector.
*****
FRIENDLY SOCIETIES: A bill establishing a new regulatory framework for
friendly societies received an unopposed second reading in the Commons
yesterday.
Mr Paul Boateng, a Labour Treasury spokesman, said with the election
pending, it was 'a second reading into oblivion.'

FT  10 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Parties fail to burst through 40%
barrier - Public Opinion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE week the election is likely to be called the two main parties are
neck and neck in the public's estimation, according to the FT's poll of
polls.
After a week in which Labour believes it has neutralised the prospect of any
tax cuts with accusations of Tory economic imprudence, the compilation
suggests it may still take today's Budget to break the poll deadlock.
The latest weighted average, which takes account of the differing sample
sizes of the seven polls covered, puts Labour almost exactly level with the
Tories - with both parties on about 38.6 per cent, while the Liberal
Democrats are just below 18 per cent.
If this were translated into parliamentary seats, the Tories would still be
the largest single party, with 311 MPs.
They would still be short of the 326 needed for an overall majority, but
would be clearly ahead of Labour, on 296. The Liberal Democrats would have
19 seats.
While support for the Tories is almost precisely where it was in last week's
compilation of opinion polls, the Labour party's showing has slipped from
just over 39 per cent. The Liberal Democrats have recorded a further slight
increase.
At present the Liberal Democrats have 22 MPs, while Labour has 230 and the
Tories 367.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour to highlight NHS after
Budget - Health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday tried to pre-empt today's Budget by spelling out a stark
'choice' between cuts in income tax and specific examples of alternative
uses for the revenue in improved public services.
Labour is determined to keep the NHS at the centre of the election campaign
as debate about the Budget starts today.
Mr Robin Cook, the shadow health secretary, outlined just six measures that
could be taken to boost the National Health Service for less than Pounds
100m, or a twentieth of the value of lost revenues if the basic rate of
income tax was reduced by 1p.
Among the examples were a freeze in prescription charges, due to increase
next month, an additional 1,000 nurses, 230 posts for cancer treatment and
150 new cardiac specialists.
'The choice must be to build better services for the public rather than to
buy re-election for themselves,' Mr Cook said.
His attack was swiftly rebutted by the Tories. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the
health minister, charged that Labour's policies would 'drain nearly Pounds
1bn from direct health-care services - and very largely it would be the
unions who won out.'
She backed her claim with figures arguing that the national minimum wage
plan would cost the NHS Pounds 500m, while the abolition of charges would
divert a further Pounds 365m away from direct patient care.
Adding that NHS spending had risen by 55 per cent above inflation in the
last 13 years, Mrs Bottomley claimed that planned government spending would
add a further boost of Pounds 2.7bn.
In spite of a new determination by the Tories to tackle Labour's NHS attacks
head on, opposition strategists believe their polling shows clearly that it
remains a 'winning' issue.
In a separate move, Mr Cook yesterday repeated his argument that Mr William
Waldegrave, the health secretary, had inflated his claims of the number of
acute in-patients expected to be treated by the NHS this year by at least
500,000.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Brown stresses community role -
Constitutional Reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON BROWN, the shadow trade and industry secretary, yesterday
highlighted the role that the community should play as a counterweight to
the power of central government.
In the first of a series of lectures organised by Charter 88, the
constitutional reform movement, Mr Brown said Labour had a historic role in
standing up for individual citizens against vested interests.
'A modern view of socialism must retrieve the broad idea of community from
the narrow notion of the state and ensure that the community becomes a means
by which individuals can realise their potential, not at the expense of
individual liberty, but in advancing it,' he said.
In a speech covering many areas of government accountability and devolution,
Mr Brown emphasised that constitutional change was central rather than
incidental to the UK's future.
In an implicit attack on Scottish nationalism, he argued against a return to
19th-century ideas of an exclusive nation-state, and for 'the dream of home
rule without the retreat into separation'.
Acknowledging that individual rights could be entrenched through specific
statutes - the approach favoured by Mr Roy Hattersley, shadow home secretary
 -he raised the possibility of incorporating the European Convention of
Human Rights into UK law.
He said the debate on electoral reform must address the possible mechanisms
as well as the ideals behind them.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Living Under The Tories: The state gives to those who have .
. . - Budget 92
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOTERS have been living under the Tories for nearly 13 years. But are enough
people really better off than they were in 1979 when Mrs Margaret Thatcher
swept to power? When her successor fires the starting gun the 'feel-good'
factor will play a central role in determining the outcome of the election.
If Mr Major is to win he must persuade the voters to lift their heads above
the current recessionary gloom and conclude that they are better off now
than they have ever been.
In today's Budget speech the chancellor must not only promise lower taxes
and greater prosperity in the future, he must also persuade the voters that
he can deliver on these promises on the basis of his government's record.
So what are the facts? Has this been a good decade to live in Britain; and
who have been the winners and the losers?
The figures on this page provide a simplified snapshot of a far more complex
reality. But it does seem that, on average, British households saw their
disposable incomes rise faster in the 1980s than elsewhere in Europe. Real
household incomes rose by 3 per cent a year, outstripping those in Germany,
France, Italy and Spain. In part this was because the pre-tax incomes of
British workers grew faster. But the UK government has also shifted the tax
system away from taxing income to taxing spending, leaving more money in the
pockets of British workers.
Value added tax has more than doubled to 17.5 per cent since 1979. But the
basic rate of income tax has fallen from 33 per cent to 25 per cent, while
the top tax rate is now 40 per cent for earned and unearned alike. That
compares with 83 per cent and 98 per cent respectively in 1979.
These gains have not been evenly shared. The pre-tax nominal earnings of the
richest 10 per cent of male workers rose by 264 per cent between 1979 and
1991 compared with 162 per cent for the lowest-paid 10 per cent.
Moreover, official unemployment has doubled from 1.3m in 1979 to 2.6m today.
The real living standards of employed people may have risen by 4 per cent
last year, but rising unemployment has also meant that average living
standards of the population as a whole have declined.
Changes to the tax and benefit system have also benefited the rich and not
the poor. The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculates that the top 50 per
cent of households were made better off in real terms in the 11 Tory budgets
between 1979 and 1990, while the poorest half of households lost out. The
average British household is Pounds 11 a week better off in 1991 prices as a
result of tax an benefit changes. The richest 10 per cent have gained Pounds
95 a week while a single unemployed man has lost Pounds 6 a week.
For those still in work, however, the 1980s has been a decade of rising real
incomes, especially for those on high incomes. Politically, the Tories'
calculation must be that the gainers and not the losers will turn the
election in their favour.
Below we show how four families, all of whom earn above-average incomes,
have fared since 1979. For those families the past 12 years have been
unambiguously good.
The highest-earning family is the clear winner. Its real pre-tax income has
risen by 25 per cent since 1979. But the effect of top-rate tax cuts has
been to raise its post-tax income, net of mortgage interest payments, by 103
per cent.
The percentage of this family's income that is taken in direct taxation has
fallen from 47 per cent in 1979 to 38 per cent today.
For our two-earner family, post-tax income has risen by 31 per cent since
1979. The pensioner couple's pre-tax income has risen by a mere 5.1 per
cent. But tax cuts have boosted their real post-tax income by a healthy 18
per cent.
The regional pattern of living-standard gains across Britain are similarly
uneven. The wider the shaded area, the greater the gain in real purchasing
power - the difference between actual pre-tax income and that required to
maintain a fixed living standard.
Average nominal incomes have risen fastest in south-east England, but real
living standards in the 1980s have risen faster in northern England and
Scotland.
The south-east was hit earlier by rising house prices. Living costs have
risen slowest in Scotland, where the house price boom was more moderate.
All of which paints a mixed picture for the Tories. The painful side-effects
of the Lawson boom and the subsequent rise in unemployment have been
concentrated in Tory marginals in the south and Midlands.
Over the past 18 months the sharp fall in southern house prices and in
interest rates has boosted the living standards of employed southerners
relative to the rest of the country. But try telling that to nervous
south-east householders.

FT  10 MAR 92 / TI chairman calls for devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN should start discussions with its partners in the European exchange
rate mechanism to allow a devaluation of sterling and an early cut in UK
interest rates, according to Mr Christopher Lewinton, chairman and chief
executive of TI, the engineering group.
Mr Lewinton said such a move was necessary to ease the pain felt by the
business community as a result of the recession.
His comments reflect the deep unease of many industrialists about what he
says is the 'punitively high' level of base rates, which have been held at
10.5 per cent for more than six months.
The remarks are likely to reopen the debate about reducing the pound's
DM2.95 central peg in the ERM. Ministers have ruled out a devaluation and
many industrialists have been nervous about speaking publicly about such a
move. Both groups have argued that even to consider the topic could
jeopardise confidence in the pound on foreign exchange markets.
But Mr Lewinton - who supports both the government and the general
principles of the ERM - said he was confident ministers could achieve a
devaluation in the context of an upward revaluation of the D-Mark, agreed to
by Germany and other ERM members.
'It's not in Europe's interests to have a weakened UK,' said Mr Lewinton.
'There should be a way of allowing a serious cut in UK rates without
disturbing the ERM club.'
A reduction in base rates to increase industrial confidence and investment
was the main economic priority for Britain, he added.
Mr Lewinton was among a group of senior industrialists sounded out by the
government last year for views on the economy.
He said that in other countries where TI traded - such as the US, France,
Italy and Germany - he did not sense the 'same lack of solutions' about
economic problems as in Britain.
He said: 'Britain is not thinking enough about growth. There is a lot of
discussion about getting inflation under control, but you don't win by
having just one goal.'

FT  10 MAR 92 / Van sales check fall in commercial vehicles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES OF new commercial vehicle were 5.3 per cent lower last month than in
February last year. This is the smallest year-on-year fall since the
industry started its slide into recession in the last quarter of 1989.
New vehicle registrations fell to 16,307 from 17,214 a year earlier,
according to figures the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
Sales were boosted by large fleet orders for small vans won by Ford and
Vauxhall, however. Sales of light commercial vehicles up to 1.8 tonnes gross
vehicle weight, which include Ford Escort and Vauxhall Astra vans, were 4.3
per cent higher last month than a year before.
By contrast sales of medium vans last month remained depressed and were
still 10.2 per cent lower than a year ago. Truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes)
fell again by 7.8 per cent.
Commercial vehicle sales have been falling for 29 consecutive months, with
the industry suffering the steepest fall into recession since the Second
World War.
New commercial vehicle sales of 32,984 for the first two months were 11.7
per cent lower than a year earlier.
In the past three years the UK commercial vehicle market has shrunk by half
and sales in the first two months were 49.1 per cent lower than the 64,802
achieved in the first two months of 1989.
Truck sales of 4,660 in the first two months of the year were 62.5 per cent
down from the 12,413 achieved in the same period three years ago.
Rover is the biggest loser in the small-van market. Its sales in the first
two months of the year were 45.5 per cent lower than a year ago.
Rover still held an 8.4 per cent share of the small van segment, but it is
expected to withdraw from the light commercial vehicle market when its
present Maestro van is phased out. Ford and Vauxhall already each control
more than a third of small-van sales in the UK.
Volkswagen is gaining ground strongly in the medium-van segment following
the launch last year of its Transporter van range, while Leyland DAF has
increased its van sales by 15.3 per cent in the first two months this year.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Recorded crimes up 16% in year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of recorded crimes in England and Wales rose 16 per cent to 5.3m
last year, with crime up in all 43 police-force areas.
Mr John Patten, home office minister, said the figures showed a 'welcome
slowdown' in the rate of increase. Figures for October 1990 to September
last year showed a record 19 per cent annual rise.
Mr Roy Hattersley, shadow home secretary, said the figures were 'truly
appalling'.
Labour said the figures had been released some weeks earlier than usual to
avoid their release during the general election campaign. The government
said they had been released yesterday 'because they were ready'.
Violent crime increased 6 per cent last year, although crimes of violence
accounted for only 5 per cent of all offences.
Car crimes accounted for nearly a third of the overall increase of 730,000
offences.
Police cleared up 1.5m crimes last year, an increase of 7 per cent, but this
was outweighed by the rise in recorded offences. As a result, the clear-up
rate fell 3 per cent to 29 per cent of the total.

WARY consumers paid back more than they borrowed in January, for the sixth
consecutive month as a recovery in spending continued to elude the economy.
Demand for credit shrank in the three months to January when consumers made
a net repayment of Pounds 293m. This compared with a net repayment of Pounds
212m in the three months to October.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that new credit advanced to
consumers fell from a seasonally adjusted Pounds 4.1bn in December to Pounds
3.9bn in January.
In January, the latest month for which a figure is available, consumers made
a net repayment of Pounds 62m of credit from finance houses, building
societies, and bank credit cards that are part of the Visa or Mastercard
system.
This followed a net repayment of Pounds 197m in December, the highest figure
since December 1976.
The last increase in outstanding credit was in July last year, when
consumers added Pounds 165m to their debts.
Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said the latest net
repayment of consumer credit highlighted 'the extent to which consumer
spending and thus economic recovery is being inhibited by the combination of
the large debt burden that was accumulated during the late 1980s and
continued high real interest rates'.
In the three months to January new credit advanced to consumers totalled
Pounds 11.7bn, marginally lower than in the three months to October when it
totalled Pounds 11.8bn.
The figures for credit-card debt were slightly more buoyant. The amount of
debt outstanding increased by Pounds 23m compared with a net repayment of
Pounds 33m in December.
In the three months to January the amount of debt outstanding on credit
cards grew by Pounds 34m compared with a net repayment of Pounds 2m in the
previous three months.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Complaints to adverts watchdog top
10,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
COMPLAINTS to the Advertising Standards Authority, the self-regulatory
watchdog, passed 10,000 for the first time last year, although the number of
advertisements complained about fell to 607 from 628 in 1990, according to
the authority's annual report published yesterday.
Of the 10,610 complaints about press and poster advertisements, 667
concerned Benetton, the Italian clothing company. All the complaints against
Benetton were upheld, forming more than a quarter of the 2,416 complaints
which the authority upheld. The Benetton advertisements which were the
subject of complaints featured a new-born baby, and a white and a black
child depicted as an angel and devil respectively.
The report suggests that spurious claims that products are environmentally
friendly are decreasing. Other findings included:
Timeshare promotion advertising devices 'regrettably grew in popularity'.
Complaints on matters of taste and decency doubled last year, due largely to
Benetton's campaign.
Complaints about the portrayal of women in advertising fell to 373 from 397
in 1990. The increased number of mail-order advertisements for food
supplements and quasi-medicines, claims for which bear little relation to
their effect, was 'the most disturbing growth area'.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): NatWest signals a tough line over pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank has indicated that it intends to take a tough line
in pay negotiations with 76,000 UK staff this year by making an opening
offer of 2 per cent.
Although the bank is also increasing incentives for staff to perform well,
unions say the total package is worth less than 2.5 per cent, lower than
packages offered by Barclays and Lloyds banks to their employees.
Mr Bob Carthy, general secretary of the NatWest Staff Association, said the
offer was extremely disappointing. It followed a year in which staff had to
contend with uncertainty about their future employment and changes in
working practices, he said.
Settlements at the big four clearing banks traditionally influence the
outcome of pay talks at many other financial services companies. Before
yesterday's publication of the NatWest offer Barclays had proposed a deal
for its staff worth a little more than 3 per cent.
Lloyds increased salaries for staff by 4 per cent from January 1, three
months ahead of the settlement date, partly in an attempt to settle a
dispute over a restructuring of pay scales.
Under the NatWest offer, to be implemented from April 1, high-performing
staff will receive up to 3.5 per cent in new money. This is because the bank
is extending increments for outstanding performers, paid in addition to the
general offer, from 6 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
Further meetings between the bank and the staff association and Bifu, the
financial services union, are planned.
Union leaders believe an increase in the offer is likely, but say there are
no signs that the movement will be substantial. The bank described its offer
as respectable.
The staff association has asked for a 5 per cent rise. The latest reported
inflation rate, for the year to January, was 4.1 per cent.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Woman manager fights demotion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST senior woman in the marketing department of British Gas lost her
job to a man junior to her and was praised for taking the news 'like a man',
an industrial tribunal in London heard yesterday.
Ms Hilary Williams, who earns Pounds 45,000 a year and was formerly regional
marketing services manager for the British Gas south-west region, was the
only manager of her grade demoted in a reorganisation over the past two
years. All 11 male managers kept their jobs. Ms Williams is claiming sex
discrimination.
The case hinges on whether Ms Williams' original job was significantly
changed by the reorganisation. Guidelines said managers would retain their
jobs where those jobs did not change substantially, irrespective of
performance.
British Gas said the post created by the reorganisation contained an
additional information technology element amounting to 30 per cent of the
workload. This meant the post could be advertised.
Ms Williams's lawyer Miss Sue Ashtiany said the job descriptions drawn up
for advertisements before and after the reorganisation were similar and that
Mr Peter Barham, who won the post, had no special information technology
qualifications.
Miss Ashtiany said Ms Williams contested British Gas's view that Mr Barham
had done her job better than she did while she was on secondment to British
Gas in London. She said that before the reorganisation senior managers had
judged Ms Williams as demonstrating good potential for further development.
Later, she was described as relying on instinct rather than hard facts.
Ms Williams was among British Gas's top 700 managers. She joined the
organisation in 1983 after holding jobs in the prison service, local
government, an oil company and a management consultancy.
The case continues today.
A female pool champion will today, at an industrial tribunal in Leeds,
accuse the Professional Pool Players Organisation of failing to grant her
professional status even though she has won many tournaments.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Royal Mail seeks to end 'Buggins'
turn' system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL MAIL, the letters arm of the Post Office, wants to scrap its promotion
system for postal workers, which relies on 'Buggins' turn' - advancement
through long service.
Management had originally set a deadline of yesterday for reform of the
rules but has run into union opposition. The UCW postal workers' union says
more than 20 of its branches want to hold ballots for industrial action on
the issue.
'Buggins' turn' is increasingly under siege. From the end of this month
British Rail station workers will be promoted on merit rather than length of
service. RMT, the transport union, has already largely agreed to the changes
at BR.
Candidates for Postman Higher Grade (PHG) jobs take a written test but, if
there is more than one candidate, promotion goes to the applicant with
longest service. PHG workers supervise sorting and earn 15 per cent more
than basic-grade postal workers.
Royal Mail management has argued that the system works against equal
opportunities but the UCW says promotion by seniority prevents favouritism
or prejudice against women and ethnic minorities.
The Equal Opportunities Commission says it is generally against promotion by
seniority because it could, for example, work against women who take career
breaks to care for children. It favours promotion solely on merit.
The union said Royal Mail tried to reform the system last summer. It added
that a circular was issued but was implemented by local managers only in
areas where there are now threats of industrial action.
Royal Mail says that negotiations with the union are 'amicable' and are
aimed at 'codifying the way experience balances against merit'. Experience
would still play a part in selecting PHG workers, described by management as
the 'non-commissioned officers of the sorting-room floor'.

<TEXT>
BEDFORDSHIRE Training and Enterprise Council has warned Mr Michael Howard,
the employment secretary, that it cannot sign a contract for training young
people and unemployed adults because of a reduction in its funding.
Tecs have been involved in negotiations over their funding for the past few
weeks. Two have already signed contracts, 48 have agreed and 32 are still
negotiating.
Mr Jack Mather, chairman of the Bedfordshire Tec, said it had reached a
stale-mate.
Mr Mather has told Mr Howard that his co-directors 'are unwilling to
authorise the 1992-93 contract as it currently stands'.
He said unemployment in Bedfordshire had doubled in the past year, yet the
Tec's funding offer was down to Pounds 9.3m from Pounds 9.6m, which would
result in a cut in youth and adult training.
The Department of Employment said its regional director was still negoiating
with the Tec and hoped to reach an agreement soon.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Insurers are 'losing out' in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH insurance industry, traditionally regarded as a world leader, is
losing out in the European market, according to research published by
Datamonitor, a London-based management consultancy.
Barriers to cross-border competition in Europe have been broken down in the
past five years, and leading French, Swiss and German companies have
increased their share of the European market while most UK companies have
made little impact.
Mr Mike Jones, chief executive of the Association of British Insurers,
yesterday said the report ignored a number of initiatives by UK companies on
the Continent in recent years.
Datamonitor says UK companies have chosen to expand in north America and
Australasia. Nevertheless its figures, which cover Europe's 15 largest
insurers, show that UK companies have been unable to increase significantly
their already small shares of Continental markets.
The report adds: 'British presence in emerging insurance markets such as
Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece is well behind that of its European
competitors.' The research suggests tough regulatory regimes in many
European countries have dissuaded many UK companies from expanding in
continental Europe. Mr Ian Harcus, one of the authors of the report, said:
'UK insurance managers are used to a much freer rein.'
Of the UK's leading insurers, only Commercial Union has made headway. It
earned 32.7 per cent of its European premium income from outside the UK,
although this largely reflected the strength of its Dutch subsidiary Delta
Lloyd, acquired in the early 1970s.
French insurers - whether mainly state-owned such as Union des Assurances de
Paris or mainly privately-owned such as Groupe Victoire - have been in the
forefront of European expansion. Victoire, which bought Germany's
second-biggest company, Colonia, in 1989, now derives nearly 46 per cent of
its European business from outside France. Victoire and UAP increased the
amount of their non-French European business by 107 per cent and 65.8 per
cent respectively between 1986 and 1990.
Europe's biggest insurer, Allianz of Germany, has also expanded aggressively
in Europe. It derives 48.7 per cent of premium income from Europe outside
Germany.
Switzerland's leading insurers, Zurich, which earns 45.8 per cent of its
European income from outside Switzerland, and Winterthur, earning 39.9 per
cent outside the country, are also well placed.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Environment ideas sought from City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL institutions must find new ways to finance environmental
improvements for industry and householders, Mr Michael Heseltine, the
environment secretary, told a City audience last night.
He also made clear that the introduction of a carbon tax on fossil fuels,
which contribute to global warming, was still some way off.
He said the environmental performance of British business and industry was
'disappointing' and that the UK was losing the battle for export markets for
environmental equipment.
Mr Heseltine urged an initiative to form a consortium, or two competing
consortia, to provide a comprehensive package of energy-efficient products
and services, finance and advice.
The consortia might consist of financial institutions, energy utilities and
equipment suppliers, offering a 'one-stop quality controlled package' to
householders.
The Department of the Environment said last night this would have an
advantage over competing advice given when householders wish to install
insulation or other energy-saving systems. It would encourage the public to
be more conscious of energy conservation.
Mr Heseltine called for innovative leasing arrangements to help small
companies which find it difficult to meet the capital cost of
pollution-control technology needed to comply with tougher 'green'
regulations.
There was room for a new package, put together by financial institutions and
the suppliers of environmental technology, to help overcome these barriers
to environmental standards and market growth.
Mr Heseltine had in mind a system similar to the one under which aircraft
are leased to airlines over a long period.
On a carbon or energy tax he said the government was not opposed in
principle to measures being proposed by the European Commission provided
they were adopted by the UK's competitors. 'But there is still a great deal
of work to be done before we know exactly what form such a tax might take,'
he said.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Nuclear Electric forced to halt auction of contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR Electric, the state-owned nuclear power generator, yesterday froze
its latest auction of long-term supply contracts after being criticised by
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, for
squeezing the market.
Prof Littlechild, presenting his annual report, said the generator had
caused difficulties for customers by putting a very high reserve price on
the two auctions it had held.
He said: 'This is a matter of concern. I am therefore monitoring Nuclear
Electric's dealings in the contract markets and will wish to ensure that
there is no undue restriction of contract availability.'
The generator has been offering contracts, mainly to regional electricity
distribution companies, for the 1992-93 period. Fewer than half the
contracts on offer in the first auction were sold because of the high prices
set by Nuclear Electric. High prices in the second auction led to few
additional sales.
Nuclear Electric has also drawn fire from large industrial power users,
which feared it was helping to cause an overall rise in power prices.
Although the group has only a 20 per cent share of the overall power market
it has a strong influence over the contract market. Other generators channel
much output to the domestic market, in which Nuclear Electric does not
compete.
Prof Littlechild said he would discuss with Nuclear Electric more
appropriate ways of selling its contracts. He said the group's licence
should contain similar requirements to those of the other generators about
plant availability.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Failure to disclose full pension information revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANY ANNUAL reports still fail to provide significant disclosure of
pensions information, a survey for last year by actuaries William Mercer
Fraser indicates.
Only 10 per cent of the top 100 companies provide information on how pension
surpluses are spread over the future working lifetime of employees. Two
thirds give no information on dividend increases.
SSAP 24, the accounting standard dealing with pensions, does not require
disclosure, but the contributions can have a significant effect on reported
profits.
The survey also shows that only five of a sample of 165 companies mentioned
the Barber judgment on equalisation of pensions, which is likely to have a
strong impact on payments.
Nearly a fifth of British companies have adopted the controversial practice
of including intangible assets in their balance sheets, according to a
survey in the March issue of Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based
monitoring service of company accounts.
Eighteen per cent of a sample of 630 quoted companies' most recent annual
reports show the presence of intangibles, the non-physical assets of a
business which contribute to future earnings. The legitimacy of using
intangibles is being considered by the Accounting Standards Board in
preparation for one of the most hotly debated accounting standards it is
likely to draft.
The most common - identified in 19 per cent of cases of those companies
stating intangibles - is goodwill, the difference between the purchase price
of an acquisition and the value of its tangible assets. Patents and
trademarks arose in 13 per cent of cases and research and development costs
in 12 per cent. Exploration costs, brand names and technical knowhow also
occur frequently.
Paradoxically, 6 per cent of companies treat items such as oil exploration
costs and licences as tangible fixed assets.

   By JOHN HUNT

<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Rivers Authority is seeking Pounds 100,000 in costs from
Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, which has decided to drop a
High Court action against the authority.
Greenpeace claimed that the rivers watchdog had not fulfilled its
responsibilities to control pollution in the case of the Albright &amp; Wilson
chemicals plant on the Cumbrian coast. The company was fined after
Greenpeace initiated court action alleging it had allowed polluting
materials above the permitted limits to escape into the Irish Sea.
Greenpeace had been given leave to take the authority to the High Court, but
in a letter to the authority it said it was now satisfied that proceedings
did not need to be continued.
Lord Crickhowell, chairman of the authority, said yesterday he would not
agree to the proceedings being stopped without full payment of costs arising
from the 'costly and groundless' case.
This is the first time in the UK that an organisation has tried to claim
costs from a 'green' lobbying group.
Lord Crickhowell said the proceedings were 'ill-conceived and totally
unjustified'.

FT  10 MAR 92 / A spectacle to make even Pontius Pilate blush: How poor
regulation made the plundering of Maxwell pension funds possible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE regulators had 'acted with the proper degree of suspicion . . . and
if professional advisers' care had been commensurate with their fees . . .
then the Maxwell pension funds would have been secure'.
That is the conclusion of Mr Frank Field, chairman of the Commons social
security committee, which yesterday published a 95-page report hitting out
at City regulators, auditors and banks for their part in the Maxwell frauds,
and calling for urgent and radical pension law reform.
It also tells banks which received the stolen Maxwell funds that they have a
'moral duty' to compensate the Maxwell pensioners, a view likely to be
vigorously contested.
The committee's inquiry started nine months ago and found its work thrust
into the spotlight by the death in November of Robert Maxwell, the
publisher.
It rapidly emerged that in the last year of his life he had plundered more
than Pounds 400m from the pension funds of companies under his control to
prop up his web of tottering private companies.
About 30,000 past and present employees of Maxwell companies now face a
severe drop in their income when they retire.
In the committee's view the 'single good deed Robert Maxwell has done for
pensioners generally is to ensure that this issue of the ownership and
control of pension schemes is now high up on the political agenda'.
The central problem is that the framework for pension scheme regulation is
the law of trusts, dating back to the Middle Ages. That law leaves unclear
the ownership of assets in some significant cases, in spite of the
importance of these assets.
For most people a pension is their second most valuable asset, worth an
average of 70 per cent of the value of their house, according to the
committee's report. Pension funds make up a third of the value of the UK
stock market, or more than Pounds 160bn in 1989.
About 40 per cent of adults - 19m people  - are members of occupational
pension schemes organised by their employers, rather than state schemes, and
the law can leave the ownership of these assets open to dispute.
Where there is a surplus on the pension fund it is unclear whether this
belongs to the employees and pensioners, or to the company. Many companies
in the past decade used their legal ability to tap into pension surpluses as
a means of justifying high prices paid in takeovers.
Under present legislation responsibility for the supervision of pension
funds is also unclear.
Professional advisers and regulators involved with the Maxwell funds come in
for fierce criticism from the committee for 'the strict compartmentalised
view that each took of (its) role . . . As a committee we felt at times as
though they (the professional advisers) were witnessing a bizarre 'game' of
pass the pensions parcel . . . Pontius Pilate would have blushed at the
spectacle of so many witnesses washing their hands in public . . . of their
responsibilities'.
In particular:
The Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro), the City
investment watchdog which authorised two fund managers to invest the Maxwell
pension funds, is accused of telling the committee 'that (its) part of the
self-regulatory system works well providing all the participants are
honest'.
The accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte is criticised for rarely
attending trust meetings of the Maxwell funds although, by auditing many of
the Maxwell companies as well as the two main pension funds, it was in a
position to see the whole picture.
The committee also criticises 'those investment banks which dealt in MCC
shares for trusts and persons connected with Mr Maxwell'. This refers to the
alleged illegal operation to support MCC shares by routing share purchases
through offshore trusts.
The committee does not name any banks, but US bank Goldman Sachs handled
many of these share purchases. There is no evidence that it knew the origin
of the money.
Goldman Sachs is also understood to be the subject of the criticism of
'those investment banks who acquired shares in MCC during the closed period
for directors dealings, and then later sold those shares to Mr Maxwell under
option agreements, which if not illegal are questionable'.
The committee makes two groups of recommendations from its observation of
the Maxwell abuses. The first - that the next government should set up an
inquiry leading to a new Pensions Act - is likely be seized by all parties
for their election manifestos.
The committee recommends an inquiry, perhaps with the additional powers of a
Royal Commission, which could address directly the question of ownership of
pension funds and would 'blow away' the ambiguities created by the law of
trusts.
In the committee's view, under new legislation the Occupational Pensions
Board, one of the present regulatory agencies, should become the main agency
for occupational pension funds, taking over many of the functions of Imro.
The second group of the committee's recommendations - concerning
compensation for the Maxwell victims - is likely to prove more
controversial.
The committee recommends that:
An inquiry should consider whether to establish a pension compensation fund.
The government, as former owner of British Airways, should consider urgently
the claims of the pensioners of British International Helicopters, a BA
subsidiary taken over by Maxwell.
The government should point out to banks holding share certificates to which
the Maxwell pension funds also claim title that they have a moral, if not
legal, responsibility to return those assets.
The committee also comments that 'the circumstances surrounding the MCC
share support transactions are certainly those in which a substantial
contribution to the rebuilding of the pension fund assets is more than
appropriate'.
The committee is one of the first bodies to examine and report on the
Maxwell fraud. Its comments will no doubt be seized with warm enthusiasm by
the defrauded Maxwell pensioners. However, those claims for compensation are
likely to be vigorously contested - not least in court cases that have yet
to begin. It will probably not be clear until those cases are well under way
how much can be achieved for the Maxwell pensioners.
There may be faster progress on the wider issue of pension reform, although
the committee is realistic in its estimate that creation of new legislation
will take a minimum of three years.

<TEXT>
NATIONAL Guardian Mort-gage Corporation, a small bank and mortgage lender,
went into administration yesterday. It was the latest casualty of the
recession and the rising tide of bad debts in the housing market.
The bank, which had traded since 1897 and had a loan book of Pounds 10m
before bad debt provisions, specialised in second mortgages for homeowners.
National Guardian, based at Grayshott, Surrey, has about 1,000 depositors
who are owed a total of about Pounds 10m. Most depositors are thought to
have claims of less than Pounds 20,000 and will therefore be protected by
the Deposit Protection Scheme.
Mr Jason Elles and Mr Alan Lovett, of the Reading offices of Ernst &amp; Young,
have been appointed joint administrators.
Mortgages from National Guardian will not be affected by the administration
order and payment should be made in the normal way. The administrators said
they hoped to find an investor or partner to buy National Guardian.

FT  10 MAR 92 / MPs demand tougher credit marketing law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGHER LEGISLATION on the marketing of credit to deter banks and building
societies from encouraging reckless borrowing was called for by a
cross-party committee of MPs yesterday.
The Treasury and Civil Service Committee said Department of Trade and
Industry proposals for laws on credit marketing should not be abandoned
simply because the banks had introduced codes of practice. The committee
says there appears to be continuing significant use of junk mail urging
individuals to borrow.
Good Banking, the code published by the banks and consumer groups last year
and due to come into operation next week, is a step in the right direction,
says the report, but banks and building societies must be willing to accept
revisions reflecting the wishes of customers.
The committee recommends that for personal customers, banks and building
societies should:
Stipulate maximum periods for holding funds before they are cleared for
payment.
Consider how customers could be given details of cleared balances in their
accounts.
Give customers the right to pre-notification of account charges.
Inform customers of the standard of care expected from them when they hold
credit cards.
The committee repeats its warning to banks and building societies not to
encourage customers to borrow against the value of their home over and above
their mortgage and to stick to prudent limits on borrowing.
The MPs say building societies should support money advice centres more
generously and lenders should try to ensure that adequate money advice
services are available wherever they are needed, rather than concentrated in
a few large cities.

THE Mexican economy grew by a slower-than-expected 3.6 per cent last year,
compared with the government's most recent forecast of 4 per cent, Damian
Fraser reports from Mexico City.
The trade deficit widened to Dollars 11.18bn (Pounds 6.3bn) last year, 170
per cent higher than 1990's deficit, and substantially above recent
estimates, the government said.
The slowdown in GDP growth partly reflects a sharp upward revision in 1990's
figure, from a 3.9 per cent estimate to 4.4 per cent. But the government's
tight fiscal and exchange-rate policy played its part. The manufacturing
sector, which has grown 7.1 and 5.2 per cent in the previous two years, grew
3.7 per cent in 1991.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Presidential front-runners eager to convince today: Super
Tuesday test for Democrats and Republicans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY all logic, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, a Democrat, and Mr George
Bush, a Republican and the president, should be smiling tonight. They ought
to win most - in Mr Bush's case all  - the 11 Democratic primaries and
caucuses and eight Republican primaries that mark the heaviest day yet in
election year, now known universally as Super Tuesday.
But elections are not only about simple winners and losers. Especially in
the long primary season, expectations count a lot, which means that for both
front-runners anything less than a series of convincing victories will be
instantly, and perhaps correctly, interpreted as signs of continuing
vulnerability. Super Tuesday, therefore, carries risks as well as rewards.
Mr Bush's problem, unlikely to disappear today, is with the third of
Republican voters who decline to support him in primaries. He has campaigned
heavily in the last two weeks, dispensing presidential largesse almost
everywhere he has been, and is unlikely to lose a single state. His lead in
the delegate count is already overwhelming and he will take almost all the
421 more to be allocated today.
But he could still be embarrassed by Mr Pat Buchanan in the south, for
example in Louisiana, where another right-winger, former Ku Klux Klan man
David Duke, a local son, is also on the ballot; in Mississippi and even in
Texas, which the president calls home; and in the depressed New England
states of Rhode Island and Massachusetts.
Whatever happens, Mr Buchanan has promised to keep on waging his ideological
warfare, moving to Illinois and Michigan a week from today and, he says, all
the way to the last primary in early June in California, where Mr Bush is
not popular. Sooner or later Mr Buchanan will run out of steam and money but
his continued ability to goad Mr Bush does the president's image little
good. Perhaps for this reason, the president has decided for the moment to
remain in the White House.
On the Democratic side, the stakes for Mr Clinton are even higher today. His
tactically well-planned and well-financed campaign always banked on a big
Super Tuesday, with seven of the 11 state polls being held on his natural
border and southern turf.
He might also be the principal beneficiary of the end yesterday of the
campaign of Tom Harkin, the liberal Senator from Iowa. Mr Harkin yesterday
studiously avoided expressing a preference for any candidate. Organised
labour, Mr Harkin's bulwark, may find the centrist Mr Clinton more amenable
than Mr Paul Tsongas, who favours tax breaks and incentives for business,
and former California governor Jerry Brown, who attacks the political
establishment, of which labour remains a part.
But Mr Clinton still has not established himself as a candidate in whom the
Democratic electorate has great confidence. In part this is because of
questions about his character, raised first in allegations of marital
infidelity and draft evasion and now over his financial relationship as
governor with an Arkansas real estate developer. It also reflects the fact
that the Democratic race has become much nastier.
Mr Tsongas reflected over the weekend that he did not really like negative
political advertising but that has not stopped him attacking Mr Clinton, and
vice versa, and it certainly has not stopped Mr Brown going for both, but
especially Mr Clinton, indiscriminately.
Four years ago, Super Tuesday produced four separate Democratic winners.
This time, most of the 11 races appear to be between Mr Clinton and Mr
Tsongas, but the one which is a real litmus test for Mr Clinton's
credibility is Florida. He can afford losses in Massachusetts, Rhode Island
and Delaware and knows that in several other states Mr Tsongas has barely
campaigned, including Texas, which has most delegates at stake.
But Florida, an ethnic and economic potpourri of Californian dimensions, now
conforms to no stereotype and the Tsongas appeal to the better-educated
white and hispanic middle classes could offset the clear Clinton advantage
in money and organisation in the state. It is worth recalling that another
Greek from Massachusetts, Mr Michael Dukakis, achieved a critical primary
victory there in 1988.
A loss in Florida, or even a narrow victory, would not knock Mr Clinton off
the front-runner's perch, assuming he performs to expectations elsewhere.
But it would make him nervous, to put it mildly, about next week's
confrontations in the big northern industrialised states of Illinois and
Michigan as well as the one in New York on April 7.
For, although he already has a handy lead in the delegate count, the
Democrats are also electing a considerable number who will go the convention
in New York in July committed to no candidate. The prize of an assured first
ballot victory at the convention remains some way off.

<TEXT>
MR PAUL Tsongas won a stunning presidential caucus victory last night over
governor Bill Clinton - in London, writes Ken Warn.
The ex-senator won 53 per cent of the vote at the London meeting of
Democrats Abroad, the party's overseas arm, against 15 per cent for Mr
Clinton. Some 32 per cent registered as uncommitted.
The caucus, amid the hoopla balloons of US political campaigning, took place
in London's National Liberal Club. Presided over by party worker and actress
Deena Gornick as Aunty Sam, the vote was part of Iowa-style caucuses held in
22 countries to elect delegates to three regional conventions for Democrats
Abroad. These meetings in turn choose delegates to the Democratic National
Convention, where Democrats Abroad will send 22 delegates and two
alternates, with nine votes, out of a total of 4,288.
For Democrats Abroad this was the first caucus, rather than a postal ballot.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Robins returning to the president's lawn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN incumbent President Jimmy Carter lost the 1980 election, the Misery
Index - the sum of inflation and unemployment  - had reached almost 20 per
cent. It is now hovering around 10 per cent, suggesting that President
George Bush has a much greater chance of retaining power in November.
Mr Bush's campaign managers, however, would be the first to admit that the
economy is a headache. On some measures, consumer confidence is languishing
at its lowest level for 17 years.
Real per capita incomes have not grown since Mr Bush was elected. Perhaps
the most fertile source of economic discontent is a growing awareness that
top earners creamed off much of the increase in national income during the
past decade.
Figures from the Congressional Budget Office show that the bottom
four-fifths of the population received a meagre 6 per cent of the total
increase in post-tax incomes between 1977 and 1989.
The Bush team also must contend with a business cycle that has stubbornly
defied its predictions. A year ago, Mr Michael Boskin, the president's chief
economic adviser, confidently forecast a sustained recovery beginning last
spring. By now the economy was supposed to be growing at an annual rate of
3-4 per cent, giving voters renewed confidence in Republican economic
management. Instead the recovery fizzled out last August, leaving the
economy becalmed for two quarters.
The good news, in the memorable words of Mr Nicholas Brady, Treasury
Secretary, is that robins are back on the lawn again. Signs of recovery have
proliferated in recent weeks.
The most unexpected was last Friday's much better than expected employment
report. Employment surged by 164,000 last month, compared with analysts'
expectations of a gain of 10,000. Some of the gain was doubtful: the
increase of 133,000 jobs in retailing may reflect faulty adjustments.
Nevertheless, the overall increase in jobs - and in hours worked - suggests
incomes and production are rising.
The employment jump followed a surge in the Purchasing Managers' Index, a
reliable barometer of industrial health. The index seems to have broken
decisively through the 50 per cent level, which is the threshold for an
expanding manufacturing economy. A broad leading employment index compiled
by economists at Columbia University also rose sharply last month. The
Commerce Department's composite index of leading indicators was up
noticeably in January, after falling in the previous two months.
Residential housing has shown definite signs of improvement. New home sales
rose 12.9 per cent in January to an annual rate of 612,000, the highest
level for nearly two years. Boosted by lower mortgage rates, home sales are
running about 20 per cent higher than last summer. Housing starts and
building permits are also up significantly.
The evidence of recovery in other sectors is more tentative. Retail sales
rose 0.6 per cent in January and were revised up in previous months.
Encouraging reports from department stores suggest another increase last
month. Car sales seemed to be improving early in February but lost momentum
towards the end of the month.
Many analysts are also cheered by more rapid growth of the money supply.
Bank reserves and M1, the narrowest measure of money, are growing at
double-digit rates. More important, M2, a broader aggregate that has a
closer historical relationship with economic activity, has moved toward the
centre of its 2.5-6.5 per cent target range.
These are encouraging signs. But there are many reasons to fear that any
recovery will be lacklustre. The Federal Reserve is especially agitated by
the fragility of confidence in the bond market - probably a reflection of
deteriorating fiscal trends. In spite of falling inflation, long bond yields
have risen since early January and are again only a whisker below 8 per
cent.
This has led to a fresh upward move in mortgage rates which is choking off
the housing recovery - which, in any case, is much less robust than usual
because of chronic overbuilding of offices, hotels and residential apartment
blocks.
Consumer fundamentals are also poor. Savings rates and confidence are low.
Incomes are static. Debt burdens are still at historically high levels.
Unlike in previous recessions, there will be no big lift from a loosening of
fiscal policy. If tax cuts are agreed this year - which is still doubtful -
they will be minuscule.
The bottom line is that Mr Bush can probably reckon on a weak recovery in
the second half of this year, with gross domestic product growing at an
annual rate of 2-3 per cent. But such a recovery could fizzle out as
happened last year. Even if it does not, it may seem feeble to an electorate
reared on post-war recoveries that typically saw growth spurts of 6 per cent
or more. The economic signs are thus positive but not sufficiently so to
prevent the leading Democrats from capitalising on recent disappointments.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Top Democrats jockey for advantage in Florida
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Senator Paul Tsongas of
Massachusetts both wrapped up their Super Tuesday campaigning in Florida
yesterday with a final bid to win votes in this patchwork state that has
become the crucial battleground for today's 11 state contest.
While Mr Tsongas is expected to win in his home state of Massachusetts and
in neighbouring Rhode Island, the day will belong to Mr Clinton, who appears
assured of the lion's share of the votes in Louisiana, Mississippi,
Missouri, Oklahoma - where Mr Tsongas's campaign failed to get his name on
the ballot - Tennessee and Texas.
Only in Florida are the two competing flat out, though Mr Clinton holds the
advantage.
'If Tsongas can win Florida I think he can come away and claim victory, even
if Clinton wins everywhere else,' said Dr Darryl Paulson, a political
scientist at the University of South Florida in Saint Petersburg.
Florida's economy has suffered severely in the current recession.
Unemployment is up to 8.7 per cent, compared with 5.5 per cent four years
ago.
Tourism, a mainstay of the state's economy, suffered its sharpest downturn
last year since the 1972 oil crisis, with the number of visitors dropping 4
per cent to 39.3m. The real estate and construction industry is blighted.
Mr Clinton started his Florida campaign early, winning a December straw poll
of Democratic party delegates and building up a solid organisation.
He is strong in the northern panhandle, adjoining Alabama, Mississippi and
Georgia, and has worked to build support in south Florida, with appeals to
retired and Jewish voters in the 'gold coast' from Miami to Palm Beach.
Mr Tsongas has campaigned more in central Florida, focusing on cities such
as Tampa and Orlando.
He has recent history on his side - another Massachusetts politician,
Governor Michael Dukakis, won Florida's primary in 1988 - and has an edge
with the many transplanted north-easterners in the electorate.
He is also favoured by the generally well off and well educated electorate -
a type of voter to whom he has appealed most in other states.
Mr Tsongas has won endorsements over the last weekend from most of Florida's
main newspapers. In addition, black voters, who have in other states voted
overwhelmingly for Governor Clinton, make up a smaller proportion of the
electorate than in any other southern state.
But Mr Tsongas will not have the support of crossover Republican voters that
has boosted him in some other primaries: unlike states such as South
Carolina, where voters may choose to vote in either party's primary,
Florida's ballot is open only to registered Democrats.
Both men have lashed out at each other in press conferences, campaign tracts
and television advertisements. Governor Clinton has attacked Mr Tsongas's
positions on social security and Israel, appealing to Florida's many retired
and Jewish voters.
Mr Tsongas has hit back, accusing his rival of being willing to promise
anything to win votes. He still faces an uphill struggle, however, and said
he was following a 'silver medal strategy' in the state.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Struggle to ease plight of South Africa's poor whites:
Poverty is not confined to blacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON ANY weekday, there is a queue of the dejected and hopeless, the hungry
and frightened, at Werk en Oorleef (Work and Survive), a small charity shop
in a suburb of the South African capital, Pretoria.
Werk en Oorleef feeds 5,000 families every day on meagre rations of maize
meal and soup powder: every one of the recipients is white.
They sit or stand, pick listlessly through the shop's collection of scuffed
children's shoes and stained Babygros, and suffer the shame of the poor
white in a nation where poverty has been largely a black affair.
Indeed, apartheid was designed to save the Afrikaner from this indignity:
blacks were barred from competing for white jobs, hundreds of thousands of
whites were employed by the state, large sums were spent on white education
to uplift the Afrikaner.
But these are the people who fell through apartheid's net: some 80,000 to
100,000 of them are fed every day by Operation Hunger, a charity which also
provides food for 1.7m blacks. They are the victims of South Africa's
economic recession, itself partly the result of politically inspired
sanctions.
'They give everything to the native. They give everything to Mandela. We get
nothing,' says Mr Emmanuel Roux, a 59-year-old supplicant.
He knows how to vote in next week's whites-only referendum on apartheid. He
will vote against the government, which repealed laws reserving jobs for
whites; he will vote against ending apartheid; he will vote against the rise
of a black government, which he is certain would be neither able nor willing
to improve his lot.
Mr Roux and his wife Magda are scarcely typical of the Werk en Oorleef
queue. He has a bright eye and an easy chuckle, and proudly displays his
pregnant wife, 33 years his junior, who will soon bear him his fifth child.
Magda may be a picture of poverty, in her shapeless dress and heavy black
ankle boots, her womb swollen with another young burden. But her face is
unmarked by worrying about the high blood pressure which keeps her husband
from work and the ordeal of living in a house with no electricity or running
water, feeding her children on 2kg soup powder, 12.5kg maize meal, 1kg sugar
and a tin of jam per month.
The face of Caroline Ellis, 26, tells a different story: her eyelids droop
under the weight of cheap makeup and dejection. Hers is the story of a
broken marriage and a child lost to the welfare authorities. Her common-law
husband, Eddie Joubert, 22, earns just R500 (about Pounds 100) a month. The
rent of their flat is R450.
Kobus van Staden, 24, and his young wife Cathy, 22, are far worse off. He
glowers at the world, more out of pain than anger. He was a shift boss in
the Free State Goldfields, earning R3,000 a month, but, just before
Christmas, he was made redundant, like tens of thousands of other miners,
white and black. The Van Stadens lost their home and had to sell all of
their furniture except their bed. They live 'somewhere in the bush', in an
outside room on a remote farm. Candles are their only light; they cook on a
primus stove. Cathy weeps as she tells of how she lost their only child
during pregnancy.
Mrs Kleintjie Pereira, the shop's distraught director, says she can no
longer cope with the influx of poor whites, victims of a recession which has
also left half the black population unemployed or underemployed. 'Our people
are very proud,' she says. 'They don't want to beg for food.
But, for most of her clients, the shop is their only lifeline. They come to
her for jobs; she places them in jobs vacated by blacks who participate in
political stayaways, or in odd jobs - what used to be known as 'kaffir
work'.
Mrs Pereira fears that, whichever way the ballot goes, few of her patrons
will be able to escape from the cycle which traps them: 'We've got to stand
together and help these people. Otherwise the kids will fall into the same
old cycle. They'll leave school early. They don't get enough to eat, so they
can't study. They won't develop. If we don't do something, we're going to
have a dumb South Africa.'

FT  10 MAR 92 / Japanese drug 'could be used in Aids cases'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JAPANESE drug developed to suppress the immune system in transplant
patients could be a powerful treatment for Aids, according to tests at
Cambridge University in England, write Clive Cookson and Emiko Terazono.
Dr Abraham Karpas, an Aids specialist at the university's haematology
department, has discovered that Fujisawa Pharmaceutical's immunosuppressant
drug FK-506 stops the replication of human cells infected with HIV, the Aids
virus, while allowing uninfected cells to grow normally.
This selective impact on cells seems to distinguish FK-506 from Aids
treatments such as Wellcome's AZT, which act directly on the virus.
Fujisawa's share price surged on the Tokyo stock market yesterday, as copies
of a letter sent by Dr Karpas to the company about his studies on FK-506
circulated among brokers.
The stock jumped 5.4 per cent to a day's high of Y1,440 before closing up
Y70 at Y1,360. Fujisawa expects to launch FK-506 in Japan in 1993 and the US
and Europe in 1994. Fujisawa said the company had just received a letter
from Dr Karpas and would not be able to make any decisions until full data
was available.
Dr Karpas said he had applied for a patent to use FK-506 against HIV in
clinical trials and hoped Fujisawa would co-operate with his research group.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK fails to speed HK liaison group talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday failed to persuade China to speed the work of the
Anglo-Chinese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) which deals with problems arising
from the colony's transition to Chinese rule in 1997.
Though talks in London between Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, and UK
premier John Major and foreign secretary Douglas Hurd were described by
British officials as 'constructive,' many issues remain to be settled before
the handover.
These include the HK government's plans to 'corporatise' the Hong Kong Radio
and Television organisation, which the Chinese oppose, and UK demands to
know what use the Chinese People's Liberation Army intends to make of
military facilities in the colony.
While Qian reaffirmed China's commitment to the 1984 Anglo-Chinese joint
declaration on Hong Kong and the memorandum of understanding on the building
of the colony's new airport, he rejected British procedural proposals for
speeding work in the JLG. Britain had suggested specific deadlines be set
for replies to proposals made by either side.
The British leaders again declined to insist on faster implementation of
Hong Kong's embryonic democratic system, saying they intended to raise the
issue formally in the JLG soon. But Lu Ping, director of China's Hong Kong
and Macao Affairs office, said in Guangzhou (Canton) yesterday that any
alteration to current plans would need a change to the Basic Law, Hong
Kong's post-1997 constitution.
Qian used his visit to London to deposit the instruments of China's adhesion
to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. He called the move 'a major step
towards the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear
weapons'.
Mr Major raised human rights issues, particularly the recent sentencing in
China of 11 political dissidents, and appealed for clemency for Wang Jun
Tao, who is known to be ill.
His appeal was neither accepted nor rejected by Qian, but China has agreed
to allow an all-party group of British MPs led by Sir Geoffrey Howe, the
former foreign secretary, to visit China to look into human rights.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Singular leader was last great founding Zionist: Obituary:
Menachem Begin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT TOOK Menachem Begin more than three decades to become prime minister of
Israel. After finally achieving office in May 1977, in a watershed defeat of
the hitherto all-powerful Labour movement by his Likud party, he belied a
belligerent past by negotiating peace with Egypt, an historic and enduring
breakthrough for the Jewish state.
For that he won the Nobel peace prize, along with President Anwar Sadat of
Egypt, whose visit to Jerusalem in November 1977 was an emotional highpoint
for Israelis that is still spoken of with awe today. But in the summer of
1982 Begin took an altogether more bloody turn when he approved an all-out
invasion of Lebanon by the Israeli defence forces.
It was a disastrously misconceived adventure, meant to destroy the Palestine
Liberation Organisation and impose Israel's political will on its fragmented
northern neighbour.
Achieving neither of these aims, it led instead to thousands of dead,
including more than 600 Israelis, a deep split in Israeli society and the
shame of the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians in the Beirut refugee
camps of Sabra and Chatila by Israel's Christian militia allies.
Fourteen months after the invasion, in August 1983, Menachem Begin, by now a
shadow of the man who had transformed the Israeli political scene, became a
virtual recluse, broken by the traumatic events of the previous year,
growing ill-health and the death of his wife Aliza.
Begin, a Pole, was born into a fiercely Zionist family in Brest-Litovsk,
then in Tsarist Russia and now on the western border of present-day Belarus,
on August 16, 1913. He grew up an aggressive defender of Jewish rights
against anti-semitism in inter-war Poland and an advocate of a Jewish
homeland and state in Palestine.
When the rise of Nazism first threatened, then engulfed, eastern Europe,
Begin was already a prominent leader of the Betar organisation, the youth
wing of the Revisionist Zionist movement.
The Revisionists were inspired and led by Vladimir Ze'ev Jabotinsky, whose
mantle Begin was to assume after his death in 1940. Until Begin's electoral
victory in the 1970s, the Revisionists represented a minority among
Zionists. Their militarist posture, partly modelled on Mussolini's Italian
fascist movement, was scorned by the far more numerous socialist Zionists,
led by Jabotinsky's great rival, David Ben Gurion.
Released by the Russians in 1941, after three months in an Arctic labour
camp, Begin arrived in British mandatory Palestine in 1942. Behind him he
had left his mother, father and brother, who were all killed by the Nazis .
Within a short time he became commander of Irgun Zva'i Leumi, an underground
guerrilla group dedicated to forcing the British out.
Unlike the mainstream Zionists, Irgun and its fellow Revisionist group, the
Stern Gang, rejected any proposal to partition Palestine into Jewish and
Arab states and adopted uncompromising violence in their fight against the
British.
Irgun was responsible for actions such as the bombing of the King David
Hotel in Jerusalem in 1946 in which 91 people, including 28 Britons, died.
Two years later, a month before the British finally pulled out, Begin's men
were involved in the massacre of 200 Arab men, women and children in the
village of Deir Yassin, an event which helped prompt the exodus of
Palestinian Arabs from what became Israel.
After the state was established, Begin became a noisy but somehwat marginal
opposition leader.
But Begin and his Herut ('freedom') party took care to court the poor
Sephardic, or Oriental, Jewish immigrants pouring into Israel from North
Africa and the Middle East. These were to become a majority of the
population, but their concerns were fatally neglected by the aloof
Ashkenazi, or European, Labour leaders.
Although Begin was himself Ashkenazi, his intransigent nationalism and
no-holds-barred criticism of the government, combined with his unfailing
personal courtesy towards the new Israelis gradually won their loyalty.
This paid off dramatically in the 1977 elections when Herut, now allied in
the Likud bloc with other right-wing parties such as the Liberals, defeated
a Labour party still reeling from the trauma of near-defeat in the 1973 Yom
Kippur War.
The peace with Egypt that followed, after the Camp David negotiations hosted
by US President Jimmy Carter, surprised many who had not credited Begin with
possessing such statesmanship.
The accords were opposed by many within the Likud - notably Mr Yitzhak
Shamir, the present prime minister - and required the backing of Labour to
pass the Knesset.
By giving up the Sinai, the core of the agreement, Begin proved that Israel
could budge on the territory it captured in the 1967 Six Day War.
But his commitment to 'Eretz Israel,' the biblical Land of Israel, prevented
him yielding more than a commitment to limited Palestinian autonomy in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Ezer Weizman, then Begin's defence minister closely involved in negotiating
the accords, later a Labour member of parliament, believes Begin
deliberately backtracked on the limited commitments he did make on the West
Bank and Gaza because they contained a threat to 'Eretz Israel.'
He encouraged the further settlement of thousands of Jewish settlers in the
Arab territories, and the stalemate led ultimately to the eruption of the
Palestinian intifada, or uprising, in the West Bank and Gaza in 1987.
For all his anti-communist rhetoric, Begin had little interest in business
or economics. His government failed to overturn the deeply embedded
socialist structure of the Israeli economy. Instead, a dose of deregulation
and free-spending led to hyper-inflation and huge debts in the mid-1980s.
After his retirement, Menachem Begin rarely ventured out of his Jerusalem
apartment. As the memory of Lebanon receded, his stature in the eyes of the
Israeli public grew once more, undoubtedly enhanced by comparison with those
who succeeded him.
The hankering for such a singular leader, regarded as perhaps the last of
the great founding Zionists, is reflected in the growing popularity for his
son Binyamin, a rising Likud MP.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush Administration shared sensitive US intelligence on Iranian military
operations with Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi president, until just months
before Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
The disclosure was made yesterday by Mr Henry Gonzalez, the Democratic
chairman of the House banking committee who has been investigating US-Iraqi
relations in the context of the scandal over Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.32bn) of
improper Iraqi loans made by the Atlanta, Georgia office of Italy's Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL).
Mr Gonzalez yesterday released declassified secret documents from the
National Security Council, which he said provided proof that the Bush
Administration engaged in a policy of permitting intelligence sharing
between the US and Iraq until May 1990.
Mr Gonzalez said he had forwarded the documents to the Senate intelligence
committee, which last October, in its own report on the nomination of Mr
Robert Gates as director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), stated:
'Intelligence sharing continued on a sporadic basis until 1988 when the
Iran-Iraq war ended.' Mr Gonzalez termed the Senate report 'misleading'.
The documents include an Iraqi options paper prepared for a White House
meeting in May 1990 by Mr Gates, then deputy national security adviser to
President Bush.
A section entitled 'intelligence co-operation' notes that intelligence
exchanges had waned since the ceasefire between Iran and Iraq of 1988.
In favour of continuing such co-operation the argument is made that 'they
still provide Iraq with limited information on Iranian military activity
that would be missed.'
The section goes on to state: 'Ending this contact would close off our very
limited access to this important segment of the Iraqi establishment.' A
Congressional investigator said the Gonzalez committee had received
independent confirmation of US-Iraqi intelligence sharing that went beyond
the documents released.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S prime minister PV Narasimha Rao reinforced his political authority
yesterday when he comfortably survived what amounted to a parliamentary vote
of no confidence in his government.
His success removed the threat of a snap election which had surfaced at the
end of last week as the Congress government and opposition prepared for
confrontation.
Winding up the debate yesterday, Mr Rao spoke of the 'tense situation'
created by the opposition's combining forces to challenge the government on
inflation and unemployment.
He said he had not expected the government's majority to be tested when
India was so vulnerable to its international creditors, and when it had been
seeking to build a consensus over economic policy. 'This situation has been
forced on the government. I did not think it would happen,' he declared.
In crucial amendments to a motion of thanks on the president's address to
parliament inaugurating the present budget session, the government won by
262 votes to 210. Many opposition members, including Mr Chandra Shekhar, the
former prime minister who had said he would vote against the government,
stayed away rather than cast a vote that could have precipitated an
election.
The challenge to the Congress government emerged when all the opposition
parties, including the Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Janata Dal,
and the left, decided to join forces to condemn the government.
Until now the Congress party, just short of a majority in parliament, has
survived by creating issue-related majorities. In diverting the attack, Mr
Rao has shown his growing strength. He used the vote to rally his party, a
reluctant supporter of the shift to more market-oriented policies, and
humiliate his opponents.
His strength derives from the belief that in a snap election the Congress
party could well obtain an absolute majority. The opposition's fear of a
Congress victory caused them to back away from bringing down the government.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICAN President FW de Klerk has a winning smile and, he hopes, a
winning platform for next week's referendum on the future of apartheid. But
there is one missing ingredient from his campaign, which he yesterday took
to the ultra-conservative Orange Free State: a persuasive and positive
vision of a multi-racial future beyond apartheid.
Throughout his eight-day, whirlwind national roadshow, Mr de Klerk has
perfected his technique: he prolongs every kiss for a National party baby:
and makes doubly sure that television cameras capture him smiling
benevolently on every available pensioner.
But before audiences from Cape Town to Natal, and yesterday in fiercely
conservative Welkom, a mining community in the Orange Free State, he has
proved short on inspiration and long on reluctant acceptance of the
inevitable: an end to white rule.
His public meetings are curiously flat in tone; no questions are allowed,
little heckling has taken place and the applause is far from thunderous.
National Party organisers worry that this reflects a large degree of voter
apathy.
Faced with the biggest decision of their political lives, many whites simply
cannot bring themselves to choose between what they consider two equally
unattractive options: the risk of civil war and international sanctions if
they vote no and the risk that a yes vote would lead to economic decline.
Yesterday, Mr de Klerk took his campaign to its toughest turf yet. Drought
in the Orange Free State has left withered maize stalks and drooping
sunflowers.
As he strolled through the Liberty Centre shopping mall in Welkom, crowds
pressed forward to shake his hand - but most of them were black.
A handful of right-wing demonstrators clad in the khaki uniform of the
neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement donned masks depicting Mr de Klerk
and Mr Nelson Mandela, of the African National Congress, and paraded through
the mall arm-in-arm.
Mr de Klerk has long rebuffed the claim that he is in alliance with Mr
Mandela and his colleagues in the ANC, some of them communist. But many
white South Africans worry nonetheless, about their obviously close
relations.
Mr de Klerk urged the shoppers to give him a chance to solve the racial
conflict which has beset South Africa throughout its history. He asked for a
landslide victory, not just a simple majority.
He may yet get it, but the danger is that a low turnout and a small majority
could leave the issue unresolved - and further weaken Mr de Klerk's hand.

power plans

CHINA Light and Power (CLP) and its partner Exxon plan to spend up to
HKDollars 60bn (Pounds 4.4bn) over the next decade on new power plants and
associated transmission and distribution systems in Hong Kong, the two said
yesterday.
CLP and Exxon are the monopoly suppliers of electricity to Kowloon and the
New Territories in Hong Kong. Their predictions of future capital spending
were made as the two companies signed another 15-year scheme-of-control
agreement with the Hong Kong government for supply of power to the colony.
The agreement will run from October 1993 until 2008.
The two said they would also be signing heads of agreement with the Chinese
government this week for supply of natural gas from Hainan Island, 500 miles
south of Hong Kong, to fire a planned power station at Black Point in the
New Territories.
Black Point has a planned capacity of 6,000 MW, making it the world's
biggest thermal power station under active planning, and is due to start
producing electricity by 1996. CLP and Exxon intend up to half of it to be
fired by gas and the remainder by coal.
The China National Offshore Oil Co (CNOOC), and Arco International Oil and
Gas, the exploration arm of the US oil company, plan to lay a 500-mile
submarine pipeline from the Yinggehai gas field to the New Territories. The
agreement, which provides for supply for a minimum of 20 years, requires
CNOOC to deliver gas by 1996.
The renewal of the scheme of control for CLP and Exxon was the first major
issue the Hong Kong government put before the Chinese government in the wake
of last year's airport agreement. It was required to do so as the agreement
straddled 1997. Both companies expressed confidence in the future of Hong
Kong and southern China.
The Hong Kong government has allowed the two to keep 20 per cent of the
profits they derive from selling electricity to China. Currently, some 10-12
per cent of their output is sold to China; last year, those sales earned the
companies HKDollars 900m in revenues.
The scheme of control allows the companies to earn a return of 13.5 per
cent, and 15 per cent on average net fixed assets in electricity-related
operations.

bluster'

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREATS of retaliation against US exports by Canada's prime minister Brian
Mulroney were yesterday dismissed as 'just bluster' by a key US senator.
A spokesman for Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the international trade
sub-committee, said the US would probably take any Canadian
counter-retaliation to Gatt. Counter-retaliation for punitive duties on
softwood lumber would be 'a blatant violation of Canada's Gatt obligations'.
A preliminary Commerce Department ruling on Friday had found an export
subsidy of 14.48 per cent on Canadian soft wood shipments was allowable
under Gatt, whereas counter-retaliation was not, the spokesman added.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Mulroney last Friday blamed
'special interests getting to certain groups of people in the Congress who
then are applying pressure on those agencies that depend on them for
funding'. Mr Mulroney added: 'I'm not big on gunboat diplomacy, but we are
not without our own resources.'
Senator Baucus took the lead on the US response to Canada's termination last
October of a Softwood Lumber Memorandum of Understanding which led to the
Commerce Department finding. Along with 67 other senators, he urged the
administration to act on 'the Canadian threat to the US timber industry'.
The overwhelming response was just one sign of election year politics at
play in US trade policy. The Bush administration has been thrown into
turmoil by the challenge of Mr Patrick Buchanan to President Bush. While Mr
Bush is retreating to Washington, his surrogates are out on the campaign
trail, Mrs Carla Hills, trade representative, making the case for free trade
against the protectionist Mr Buchanan.
Democrats in Congress say the pace of talks on a North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta), involving the US, Canada and Mexico, has been slowing
since the New Hampshire primary, when the pattern began of the president
losing more than one-third of his party's vote to Mr Buchanan or to
uncommitted slates.
The Democratic primaries have brought the president some luck: the two
front-runners, former senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts and Governor
Bill Clinton of Arkansas, favour Nafta. But they want 'the right kind of
Nafta' with acceptable environmental safeguards and a workers' adjustment
programme. These must still be worked out, and time is likely to be too
short this year.

northern Iraq yesterday, officials said. It was the second cross-border raid
this month, Reuter reports from Ankara. The raid, similar to one on March 1,
appeared to be part of an attempt to cripple the guerrillas' ability to
mount an offensive.

Mr Andrzej Olechowski, Poland's new finance minister, will today meet
representatives of Poland's 500 or so western commercial bank creditors in
Warsaw to discuss a possible resumption of talks on reducing the Dollars
12bn (Pounds 6.8bn) debt, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. The talks
with commercial banks have been stalled since the middle of 1991. Poland
stopped servicing its commercial debt in the autumn of 1989 and arrears have
mounted to over Dollars 1.5bn. The commercial banks have insisted that
Poland settle its arrears before they agree to consider debt reduction.
Poland has wanted to discuss both issues together.

Thyroid cancer among children in Belarus rose steeply last year, continuing

Mr Valentin Stezhko, head of the ministry's Chernobyl department, said some
50 new cases were recorded in 1991 alone, compared with 45 between 1986 and
1990. Only seven cases of thyroid cancer were detected in the five years
before the world's worst nuclear accident.

Reuter reports from Munich.
The radioactive material, kept in a lead casing in a bag in the boot of a
Mercedes car, was confiscated. Police said the suspects, both immigrants who
had been under surveillance for some time, had planned to sell the uranium
for DM1.9m (Pounds 650m). Police said the origin of the uranium was not

FT  10 MAR 92 / A dirty small town in east Germany: A community coping with
post-communist trauma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIRTY little town of Apolda lies slumped in a trough between the earthen
waves thrown up by the former communist farming combines of north-east
Thuringia. This is no resurrection showpiece to be paraded before touring
worthies and would-be investors. There are no grand projects in Apolda. No
tower cranes to match those stalking the skylines of nearby Erfurt, Weimar
and Jena.
Apolda is a small town in eastern Germany. Its 28,000 inhabitants, like
millions of others in the former German Democratic Republic, are learning
hard economic lessons in the post-communist world.
In the centre of the town, where the coat of lignite soot is thickest,
cobbled roads lead past tumbledown houses and silent factories. A mucky
stream trundles along, nibbling at the brickwork of the brewery wall. Beyond
the wall, however, there are gleaming new boilers, mash tuns and bottling
lines.
Mr Gunther Ramthor, managing director of the Apoldaer Brewery, was works
director 'before the change'. Now he employs 68 where there were once 110.
Mr Ramthor and his three partners have invested DM2.5m (Pounds 860,000)
since they bought the plant on All Fools' Day last year from the Treuhand
privatisation agency. Since then, they have seen production drop 30 per cent
as freedom from communism brought freedom of choice and an invasion of
advertised brands from the west.
Mr Ramthor has also seen more than 20 would-be western buyers, and shown
them the door, refusing to sell. Sales of Apoldaer are rising again. New
markets have been opened in Saxony and Lower Saxony. 'People are beginning
to understand the importance of regional and local businesses,' he says.
Officially there is 25 per cent unemployment in the town , but the real
figure is 50 per cent. Half are still hidden by Bonn-funded projects such as
the job creation scheme which for a day last week occupied three young men,
overseen by two others, in painting a pedestrian crossing.
Apolda's knitting industry, which employed 8,000, now has 800 workers. The
farming workforce has been halved. The chemicals works has collapsed, like
the leather goods factory and the precision engineering plant which once
made parts for Soviet timepieces.
Many new shops have opened in the past year, and while many have since
closed, shops are still the most apparent alternative employers.
Mr Ramthor says people are learning. 'In economic terms they must first
master the bicycle and work their way up to the Airbus. All agree it will
take longer than the politicians say, but everything will come good
eventually, because people now know they must do it for themselves.'
Early waves of optimism and opportunism swept through the town and left
behind confusion and disenchantment. A dozen town-centre shops which opened
in the first months of unification have closed. Carpetbaggers set up an
environmental engineering business, ran up DM2m in debts and disappeared.
The collapse last year of plans for a car components manufacturer to employ
4,000 taught a hard lesson.
Jobs do not come to a place like Apolda by the thousand. The reality is work
for 50 former clock engineers making water meters for a western company,
Hydrometer. Reflexite, a US optics concern, and the town's only foreign
investor, has opened a workshop employing 16.
Buried below the skyline 35km from the autobahn, and with no expectations of
an early link, Apolda has developed its own ideas. Calls for aid to be
redirected into building a Mittelstand ' a core of small and medium-sized
private businesses, like the successful post-war project - have yielded
favourable echoes in Erfurt, the state capital.
Regional planners, faced with more pressing challenges in Thuringia's bigger
blackspots, want the Apolda area declared an agricultural zone, and to be
done with it. But the community wants more. 'The population is industrially
oriented,' says local journalist Mr Joachim Henniger. 'For people to be
asked to go back to the land goes against history and everything people were
taught in the GDR time.'
Plots are being marked out on the town's outer limits for industry parks to
house yet-to-be-found businesses. Logic and local ambition, according Mr
Henniger, dictate that these will process, pack, market and dispatch produce
from the surrounding acres. Apolda is ready to transform itself from a
satellite workbench for the old command economy into a vertically-integrated
food processing economy.
Most of the materials are to hand. First foundations comprise the 5,500
hectares of the Pfiffelbach farming co-operative. The communist ZBO
agricultural combine was broken up and returned to its former owners which
created a commercial group. The group has carved out the poorer land and
sold chunks of it to industry park planners. There are experienced
businessmen like Mr Ramthor, able to attract working capital. There are
people like Mr Dietmar Scheunert, one of several hundred skilled workers
from the now-closed ZBO workshops, doggedly fending for themselves.
Patience is as plentiful as industrial cycles are long in Apolda. David der
Strickersmann brought the knitting industry here in 1593 and market forces
swept it away in 1991. The land remains. On the road out, the endless black
acres, which will soon be green with crops of potatoes, wheat, and malting
barley and hops for Mr Ramthor, do not seem quite so threatening as on the
road in.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Genscher warns on the rise of nationalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY must continue working for European unity or risk the re-emergence of
nationalism, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, warned
yesterday.
Leaders of Germany's opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) party,
meanwhile, yesterday decided not to try to block parliamentary approval of
the European Community's Maastricht treaty on economic and monetary union
(Emu).
Mr Bjorn Engholm, party chairman, said the SPD still wanted improvements,
but their implementation would not be tied to the ratification deadline.
Even so, the SPD insisted in a statement that transition from the second to
the third stage of Emu, planned for 1999 at the latest, could not be
automatic. Ratification of the treaty was no 'carte blanche' for the
government.
The Bundestag, the German parliament, must have a new vote before the final
steps were taken and a common European currency adopted.
Speaking after a meeting of the SPD executive in Bonn, Mr Engholm attempted
to repair the damage done to the party's staunch pro-European posture last
week by Mr Oskar Lafontaine, prime minister of Saarland. His proposal that
the SPD should use its power to reject the whole Maastricht deal had drawn
fire from SPD colleagues and members of the ruling coalition alike.
SPD votes would be needed for the government to achieve the two-thirds
majority needed for constitutional changes made necessary by the treaty.
Mr Genscher, speaking in Berlin yesterday, made political capital out of
recent opposition disarray over European policy.
'The 'yes' from Europe to German unity must be followed by a 'yes' to Europe
from Germany,' he said.
There must not be any doubt that small-minded rejection of progress towards
European unity could damage Germany's positive image and lead to new
nationalism.
Mr Engholm stood by most of the SPD's demands for a thorough re-examination
by the Bundestag of the outcome and implications of the Maastricht summit as
part of its 'new decision before entry into the third stage'.
The parliament had to ensure that necessary economic convergence criteria
could be guaranteed, an official statement said.
It would need to be assured that progress towards Emu was balanced with
similar advances in European political union (Epu).
Rights of the European Parliament should also be strengthened, and that the
future European central bank should ensure that economic policies should be
responsibly co-ordinated.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Serbs delay EC's plan for Bosnian state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF Bosnia's main ethnic groups, the Moslems and Croats, yesterday agreed
to the outline of a federation for their trouble-torn republic.
However, Bosnian Serb negotiators reserved their position, prompting Lord
Carrington, chairman of the European Community-sponsored peace conference,
to declare that it would be 'a very great pity if the Serbs in Bosnia pass
up this opportunity for an agreement'.
Despite separate talks between the three Bosnian groups starting on Sunday
and lasting until 6am yesterday - before the three-hour plenary session with
other Yugoslav republics - leaders of Bosnia's Serbs said they had to
consult their community back home before pronouncing on the draft plan.
After chairing the first plenary session of the EC's peace conference on
Yugoslavia for two months, Lord Carrington described the plan as an
opportunity which 'if missed is going to lead to considerable trouble'. But
he said the Bosnian Serb leaders showed themselves 'perfectly prepared to
recognise the independence of Bosnia', despite the widespread Serb boycott
of the recent referendum.
The plan for Bosnia would create a bicameral system, with a Chamber of
Citizens elected proportionally and a Chamber of Constituent Units giving
Moslems, Serbs and Croats equal representation. A four-fifths majority in
the latter chamber would be required for any decisions on the republic's
flag, education, religion, and macro-economic policy.
The EC conference officials hope a deal on Bosnia is now within their reach,
and that this could pave the way to progress on wider problems such as the
future economic relationship between the four republics - Croatia, Slovenia,
Bosnia and Macedonia - seeking independence and the Serbian-Montengrin rump
of Yugoslavia, and their status in international bodies.
With the fate of Bosnia so delicately balanced, foreign ministers of the EC
may seek to dissuade the US from immediately recognising the four
independence-seeking republics, when they meet Mr James Baker, the US
secretary of state, in Brussels later today.
In a sharp shift of US policy, which has so far been not to give any formal
recognition to seceding republics, Mr Baker sent the EC a letter, arguing
that if Bosnia is recognised as an independent unit, it may avoid a
dangerous fragmentation. The violence following the Bosnia referendum
appears to have changed Washington's mind. Mr Baker urged 'the collective
recognition of Bosnia and its territorial integrity'.

IRAN yesterday called on the United Nations to impose an arms embargo on
Azerbaijan and Armenia to force the former Soviet republics to settle their
bloody dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, Reuter reports from Nicosia.
In a letter to UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali, Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati expressed concern at the growing fighting near Iran's
border and called for a 'halt to arm shipments to the two sides from
neighbours and big powers'.
His call came a day after Turkey, Iran's neighbour and rival for influence
in the Moslem former Soviet republics, asked the US to get involved in peace
efforts.
Meanwhile, in Armenia yesterday, dozens of heavily armed Armenian militants
surrounded a former Soviet anti-aircraft missile base, killing two soldiers
of the Commonwealth of Independent States and taking the commander hostage.
The militants, who surrounded the base at Artik, near the Turkish border,
were demanding the handover of heavy weapons, according to the CIS military
command.
Elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, violence continued in the month-long
civil war in Georgia. An explosion in the town of Zugdidi, in the west of
the republic , killed three policemen and injured several others.
In the republic of Moldova yesterday, peace talks were due to start after a
week of clashes between ethnic Russians and majority Romanian speakers in
which at least 10 people have been killed.
John Lloyd, in Baku, Azerbaijan, adds: Nationalist leaders in Azerbaijan
yesterday stepped up the pressure on the interim government of the republic
to dissolve parliament and to form a coalition government with a strong
contingent of nationalists and former opposition figures. The aim of such a
coalition would be to pursue a more active prosecution of the conflict in
Nagorno-Karabakh, hitting back at the Armenian forces after a string of
reverses.
Mr Niazi Ibragimov, deputy chairman of the Azerbaijani Popular Front - the
focus for opposition nationalist forces - called for the dissolution of
parliament and the passing of more power to the 50-strong National Council,
which is balanced between the opposition and former communists.

FT  10 MAR 92 / MPs urge sweeping reforms on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEEPING reform of Britain's pensions industry in the wake of the Maxwell
pensions scandal was demanded yesterday by a cross-party committee of MPs.
The committee added that financial institutions which bankrolled the late Mr
Robert Maxwell have a moral obligation to help thousands of pensioners
defrauded in the affair.
The report of the select committee on social security blamed regulators,
City institutions and professional advisers for failing to spot 'stealing on
a massive scale' from the schemes run by Mr Maxwell.
Of its own hearings, the committee said: 'Pontius Pilate would have blushed
at the spectacle of so many witnesses washing their hands in public before
the committee of their responsibilities in this affair.'
The committee, whose report met with a cautious response from the industry
and regulators, recommends that a top-level commission be established to
write a new pensions act to replace the trust law which has governed pension
fund activities for decades.
It also urges greatly expanded powers for the Occupational Pensions Board
(the quasi-governmental body that oversees some aspects of pension
operations), tighter rules on the custody and transfer of pension fund
assets, greater disclosure requirements and the establishment of a
compensation scheme for pensioners.
The committee stops short of recommending government aid for defrauded
pensioners, but says that institutions which bankrolled Mr Maxwell have a
moral responsibility to help.
The report says that banks which received pension fund assets as collateral
for their loans to Mr Maxwell have a moral obligation to return them, while
some US investment banks - which it does not name - which bought Maxwell
Communication Corporation shares in an alleged share support scheme should
help make up the shortfall.
However, it fails to address the thorniest issue for pension funds - of
whether surpluses belong to beneficiaries or employers. Committee members
urged that this question be settled by the commission it wants set up to
reform pensions law. It was Mr Maxwell's legal use of the fund surpluses
that first led to concern.
The report criticises in particular the Investment Management Regulatory
Organisation (Imro), the self-regulatory body for the fund management
industry, for its weakness in overseeing Mr Maxwell's in-house pension fund
management company, Bishopsgate Investment Management.
The report castigates the City's system of self-regulation for the pensions
industry, as 'little short of a tragic comedy'. It recommends that oversight
of pension fund managers become the responsibility of a new, more powerful
Occupational Pensions Board.
Mr John Morgan, Imro chief executive, believed the committee had come out
with a 'fair and sensible report considering the time constraints' but he
disagreed with its characterisation of self-regulation. Sir David Walker,
chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, which supervises Imro,
said a review of financial regulation was already under way.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BAKU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICERS of the former Red Army are helping to set up an independent
Azerbaijani army as tension between the republic and neighbouring Armenia
escalates.
At the same time, international efforts to halt the slide to war are
increasing, with Iran calling on the United Nations yesterday to impose an
arms embargo on Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Evidence in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, points to a chaotic dissolution
of the Soviet military and - the situation most feared by the Commonwealth
of Independent States' general staff - the incorporation of parts of it into
new, potentially hostile armed forces.
Azerbaijan and Armenia are close to open warfare over the disputed
Armenian-dominated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, where Armenian attacks have
forced most of the 40,000 Azerbaijanis who live there to flee. Azerbaijani
opinion has been inflamed by reports of massacres of civilians, including
alleged slaying of hundreds of people at Khojaly, an Azerbaijani town in
Nagorno-Karabakh.
Azerbaijani nationalist groups, growing in power since the resignation last
week of the relatively moderate President Ayaz Mutalibov, are calling for
the immediate creation of an army of 30,000 men.
The Azerbaijani government and CIS general staff are negotiating the
handover of equipment belonging to the 4th Army, based in Azerbaijan,
following the refusal of the Azerbaijani government to take part in a united
CIS force.
Units of the 366 infantry regiment pulling out of Nagorno-Karabakh are
reported to have deserted to the Armenian side.
In separate interviews yesterday, a Ukrainian colonel based in Baku and two
former Russian military personnel said they were creating groups which would
both train soldiers for a new Azerbaijani army and form a corps of
volunteers from other republics.
Colonel Alexander Slusarev, a military instructor based in Baku, who heads
the self-styled 5,000-strong Union of Ukrainian Officers serving in
Azerbaijan, said his organisation would ask the Ukrainian government for
permission to work under contract for the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defence to
trainan independent army.
He also claimed that weapons were being made available to Azerbaijanis by
the CIS army. At the same time, he charged senior military commanders with
shipping to Russia military equipment which should remain in Azerbaijan
pending its handover to the republican government.
Confirming this, Mr Niazi Ibrahim, deputy chairman of the Azeri Popular
Front - the main opposition nationalist grouping - said CIS commanders had
no control over the sale of weapons by their men to Mafia groups in
Azerbaijan. 'The army itself is a mafia in this sense,' he said.
Col Slusarev, who spoke in the presence of Mr Ibrahim, said he was in
constant contact with nationalist groups.
Mr Isa Gambarov, a member of the ruling National Council of the Azerbaijani
parliament and head of its foreign affairs committee, as well as being
leader of the 'independent Azerbaijan' party, said yesterday that the
country would welcome co-operation on military matters with Ukraine - which
like Azerbaijan, is now building its own armed force.
The interview with Mr Gambarov in his office in the Azerbaijani parliament
was interrupted by the appearance of Mr Vladimir Kozlov, a former Soviet
officer, and Mr Vladimir Malinov, a former Soviet soldier. They said they
had the permission of Mr Tahir Aliev, the Azerbaijani defence minister, to
form volunteer units to help serve in the disorganised groups which make up
the Azerbaijani military and which are now trying to contain Armenian
attacks near the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh.
They have opened a recruiting office in Baku, where they hope to enrol
officers and men serving with the 4th Army who wish to remain in military
service with security of housing and an income.

FT  10 MAR 92 / NatWest wants DTI to reopen Blue Arrow case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank last night made a highly unusual request that the
Department of Trade and Industry should reopen its investigation into the
bank's role in the 1987 Blue Arrow share issue.
Lord Alexander, NatWest chairman, said he wanted a new DTI inquiry into
allegations, made last week in The Economist magazine, that the bank and its
chief executive, Mr Tom Frost, 'misled the DTI inspectors (in the original
investigation) and . . . deliberately concealed from them contemporaneous
documents'.
He made the request in a letter to Mr Peter Lilley, the trade secretary. A
DTI official said it was too early at the moment to say whether his
department would take the decision to reopen the case.
He added that it was probably unprecedented for an investigation to start
again: 'It has never happened in my time.'
Lord Alexander said his bank found it 'difficult publicly to refute the
allegations in detail'. There are a number of court cases pending on the
Blue Arrow affair and the bank has been advised that 'the doctrine of
contempt of court makes it inadvisable for us to argue the facts publicly'.
When the DTI's original report was published, in July 1989, Lord Boardman,
then chairman of NatWest, and three executive directors resigned. They went
after the bank was criticised for failing for several months to disclose
that it had acquired a huge exposure to Blue Arrow in September 1987,
following the refusal of Blue Arrow's shareholders to take up all their
rights to new shares.
The DTI report implied that Mr Frost was less implicated in the affair than
these other directors so he stayed on.
Mr Frost said yesterday that he 'utterly rejected' suggestions that he 'knew
more about the events concerning Blue Arrow in 1987 and 1988 than was
disclosed to the DTI inspectors'.
Allegations that Mr Frost had concealed information from the DTI inspectors
were first made during the initial Blue Arrow trial, in June 1991. The
barrister acting for one of the defendants, Mr Jonathan Cohen, said that a
draft memo on the history of NatWest's involvement in the Blue Arrow deal,
containing hand-written notes made by Mr Frost, had not been submitted to
the DTI inspectors.
In that trial, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities, NatWest Investment Bank,
County NatWest and seven individuals were accused of conspiring to mislead
the stock market over the Pounds 837m Blue Arrow share issue.
Three former County employees and one former P&amp;D employee were convicted,
but the firms and the other individuals were acquitted.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Poll war to begin after Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE starting gun for the 1992 general election will be fired moments after
3.30pm today when Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, begins his
much-anticipated Budget statement.
As tension continued to mount at Westminster yesterday, nervous MPs
impatiently awaited an end to the 'phoney war' and the declaration of a
full-blown election campaign.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, is expected to give formal notice of the
ballot at the pre-Budget session of the cabinet today, confirming that he
has opted for a general election on April 9.
An official statement may be delayed until tomorrow or even Thursday. But
there are no longer any residual doubts in the Commons that the chancellor's
words will be the first shot in the closest political struggle since the
1970s.
Rarely has so much been riding on a Budget. Mr Lamont will emerge from a
pre-Budget purdah, in which there has been no sign of recovery from
recession, to face the biggest challenge of his political career.
In recent days, however, the more extravagant expectations of a massive
pre-election giveaway have been replaced by forecasts that the chancellor
will announce a balanced package with a net tax reduction of no more than
Pounds 3bn in 1992-93.
The aim will be to appeal to a cross-section of voters while presenting the
Budget as one for economic recovery. It will also serve as a manifesto for
future tax reforms if the Conservatives win the election.
A 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax from 25p is expected to be at the
heart of Mr Lamont's second Budget. He is also thought to be planning to
increase the thresholds before which income tax takes effect by more than
the statutory 4.5 per cent indexation. This would help the lower paid.
Lowering the basic rate by 1p would cost the Treasury Pounds 1.95bn while
each percentage point increase in all income tax allowances and thresholds
in addition to indexation would cost about Pounds 245m. That means the
chancellor will be looking to recoup revenue elsewhere if, as expected, he
is also to help industry and small businesses.
Downing Street confirmed last night that Mr Major has a longstanding meeting
with the Queen at 6.30pm tomorrow. This had been put back from Tuesday in
order not to clash with the Budget. It is understood, however, that the
meeting could be rescheduled at short notice. A dissolution of Parliament
would not have to be announced until the following day.
Yesterday, financial markets waited calmly for the Budget. Equities
advanced, the FT-SE 100 index closing at 2,550.7, up 17.6, but trading was
subdued.
Sterling stayed at the bottom of the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System, losing half a pfennig to DM2.8650. But it gained 0.45 cents
to Dollars 1.723, helping to lift the Bank of England's trade weighted
exchange rate index to 90.0 from 89.9 on Friday evening. In New York
sterling closed at Dollars 1.7255 and at DM2.86885.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Appointments: An upstream struggle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ed Gallagher, who was appointed last week as the new chief executive of the
National Rivers Authority, comes from an industry background.
Most recently, he has been the director at Amersham International with
responsibility for manufacturing operations in the UK, US and Germany, and
global responsibilities for distribution and information technology. A
chartered engineer, Gallagher, 47, graduated from Sheffield with a first
class degree in engineering. He joined Black &amp; Decker in 1971, first in the
UK, then from 1981 in the US where he was director of business analysis and
later of market and product development. He moved to Amersham in 1986.
Gallagher joins the NRA at a difficult time because of the government's
plans to set up a new environment agency which would take over many of the
NRA's responsibilities.
The NRA and environmental groups are fighting the proposal in order to
safeguard the NRA's position as an effective environmental watchdog. He is
also stepping into the shoes of John Bowman, the chief executive at the
launch of the NRA when the water industry in England and Wales was
privatised in 1989, who resigned last June because of 'serious shortcomings'
which led to overspending of around Pounds 1m on new headquarters in
Bristol.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Leonard Peach is to become chairman of the Police Complaints Authority
in August when the current chairman, Judge Francis Petre, retires.
Sir Leonard spent most of his working life at IBM (UK) where he specialised
in personnel management. In 1985, he was seconded to the DHSS as the first
director of personnel of the new NHS Management Board after the introduction
of general management in the health service.
When the first chief executive, Victor Paige, resigned after falling out
with his political masters, Sir Leonard moved into the top job. He was
responsible for introducing the management performance reviews and
individual performance pay for NHS managers. His three-year secondment to
the health service ended in January 1989, shortly before the introduction of
the controversial NHS reforms.
Sir Leonard returned to IBM as director of personnel and corporate affairs,
a post from which he is soon to retire.
He was president of the Institute of Personnel Management between 1983 and
1985.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Appointments: Heir-apparent at AAH
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Do merchant bankers make good company chairman? The shareholders of AAH
Holdings, the healthcare and distribution group, may not have too long to
wait to find out now that John Padovan has been appointed deputy chairman.
Padovan, 53, has excellent City connections; he has been chairman and chief
executive of County Bank, deputy chairman of Hambros Bank, and most recently
deputy chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. 'The City is mostly a place for
people under 50,' says Padovan, who retired from BZW in August 1991 and is
now embarking on a new career as a professional non-executive director.
However, he stresses that he has no aspirations to have dozens of them. He
is a non-executive at Tesco, Whitbread and The Hartstone Group which,
together with his latest appointment, should keep him fully occupied.
Bill Pybus, 68, who has headed AAH since 1968, sees Padovan as his
heir-apparent. He first got to know Padovan when the latter was running
County Bank, the merchant banking subsidiary of NatWest where Pybus was a
regional director. Padovan handled several acquisitions for AAH and Pybus
says that NatWest made a mistake in letting Padovan go.
Although the record of merchant bankers making good company chairman is
patchy, Pybus stresses that Padovan is 'very much the chairman type'. His
appointment to the AAH board is the final piece in the jigsaw. The company
appointed a finance director in November 1989, and Bill Revell was appointed
group managing director last year.

FT  10 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Spotlight falls on Guinness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDESPREAD belief that a stake has been built up in Guinness, the
international drinks group, by Mr Warren Buffett, chairman of US investment
house Salomon Inc, pushed the shares up 20 to 608p on turnover of 3.5m. A
block of shares was crossed between institutions at 607 1/2 p.
Mr John Wakely, drinks analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, reviewing doubts
regarding Mr Buffett's suggested interest, pointed out that Guinness has 'a
potential compound growth rate among the highest of any consumer company'.
He added that Mr Buffett has 'sanctified' the stock for US investors and
that, as foreign buyers raise their holdings in Guinness, UK fund managers
are in danger of becoming seriously underweight in Britain's sixth largest
company. Mr Wakely believes that some large UK investment institutions do
not own any Guinness shares at all.
Midland gains
Midland Bank moved higher as the prospect of preliminary results today from
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, holder of 14.7 per cent of the Midland
equity, rekindled speculative activity. Hints from Far East sources
suggested that Hongkong Bank may announce a rights issue along with its
results.
Suggestions that the bank might raise as much as HKDollars 20bn (around
Pounds 1.5bn) fuelled speculation that it might increase its stake in
Midland, or even mount a full takeover. A merger between Midland and
Hongkong Bank was on the cards after the Far Eastern bank acquired its stake
some years ago, but the likelihood faded last year when the two boards said
merger talks had been ended.
There were hints that other suitors had run the slide rule over Midland. BAT
Industries, the tobacco to financial services giant, has been mentioned as a
potential bidder, as has Prudential, the UK insurance group. Midland closed
6 firmer at 269p ex-dividend.
Forte advances
Hotel group Forte received a boost as the share price nudged above the 226p
level at which holders of the group's maturing Pounds 85m Eurobond can
exercise the accompanying warrants convertible into ordinary shares.
Today is the final day for holders to take up shares, and Mr Richard Power,
Forte's director of corporate affairs, said there had been a steady stream
of enquiries in recent days. 'Although it is too early to say, there has
been a lot of interest from holders wanting to convert. It is looking quite
good at the moment.'
There were fears that if the share price stayed below the 226p mark, warrant
holders would shun the chance of taking their shares and leave Forte without
the Pounds 93m that would be raised if the warrants were exercised. But Mr
Power believed many warrants were held by arbitrageurs who had gone short on
share positions over the last week, and would buy stock today. The shares
closed a penny ahead at 227p after moderate volume of 2.3m.
Gas firmer
The best performance in a generally reluctant energy sector came from
British Gas after a presentation to institutions hosted by Hoare Govett, the
company's stockbroker. Gas shares ran up 6 to 257 1/2 p on turnover of 3.1m.
Hoare said that directors of British Gas had told the gathered ranks of
institutions that the company remained committed to 'real dividend growth'.
It also emerged from the meeting that Gas executives were expecting a
constructive deal with the Office of Fair Trading regarding Gas's pipelines
business and alterations to its dominant position in industrial and
commercial gas supply in the UK.
Worries about the cost of heavy redundancies and news that County NatWest
has removed BT 'new' from its buy list upset both classes of BT stock. Mr
Patrick Wellington at County reiterated his cautious stance and said the
trading environment at BT remains very difficult: 'Political risk is
substantial and the prospect of a Labour electoral victory is not fully
reflected in the share price.' The 'old' shares eased to 333p and the 'new'
2 to 118 1/4 p.
Big switching out of NatWest and into TSB drove the latter's shares 2 1/2
better to 133p on keen turnover of 4.3m. Strong support ahead of tomorrow's
preliminary results - expected to show profits up from Pounds 150m to around
Pounds 200m and a maintained dividend - saw Standard Chartered move ahead 18
to 459p.
The composite insurance area was alive with speculation that one of its
constituents may yet emerge as the target of one of the big European
insurance groupings. Takeover talk was again centred on Guardian Royal
Exchange, which advanced 7 to 123p. Royal Insurance, depressed recently by
the dreadful figures and dividend omission, shot up 12 to 188p.
BP and Shell edged higher as the session wore on, with both stocks closing
at the day's best levels, partly reflecting keen overseas support.
The former, under pressure towards the back end of last week as its head of
exploration and production failed to wholly please US institutions at an
important presentation in New York, firmed 2 1/2 to 264 1/2 p on 6.5m shares
traded. Shell settled 5 ahead at 447p on 2m traded.
A few buyers moved back into the property sector after last week's poor
showing, picking up selected stocks. MEPC put on 7 to 342p in good turnover
of 1.2m, Land Securities improved 9 to 432p and British Land rose 11 to
225p.
A second profits warning in a week saw chemicals group MTM tumble 70 to 119p
Hopes of an imminent cut in UK interest rates inspired a burst of support
for the building stocks. Persimmon, additionally boosted by the impressive
dividend, advanced 7 to 294p.
George Wimpey, a recent strong performer as the market has anticipated the
group maintaining its final dividend when its preliminary figures are
announced on March 17, put on 6 more to 143p.
Marley, the roof tile specialist, responded to a Kleinwort Benson buy
recommendation and closed 5 higher at 122p.
A buy recommendation from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew lifted P &amp; O 40 to 399p. Mr
Richard Hannah predicted annual profits of Pounds 210m (Pounds 261m
previously).
Transport Development Group gained 3 to 269p on reporting a maintained
dividend.
Among engineering stocks, Fairey Group raced forward 22 to 385p following an
increased dividend.
A 43 per cent setback at BBA left the shares only 2 down at 132p. The
maintained dividend helped to prevent a greater fall in the shares.
T &amp; N picked up 6 to 117p on talk that the company is likely to maintain the
dividend when it reports its figures tomorrow.
US recovery hopes boosted Siebe, which rose 16 to 596p.
Brewers and spirits groups tended to be pulled up by the performance of
Guinness. Allied-Lyons put on 5 to 650p and Grand Metropolitan climbed 12 to
908p.
Figures from Hillsdown tomorrow are expected to show a decline in 1991
profits to around Pounds 184m from Pounds 191.2m. The shares rose 4 to 172p.
In the leisure sector, sentiment was helped by a positive document from
County NatWest as the stockbroker decided that 'the worst is over' and that,
within certain criteria, '1992 will be the year when the sector resumes its
pattern of outperformance' to the FT-Actuaries All-Share index.
Reflection on its purchase of Virgin's music division helped Thorn EMI add 9
at 815p. There was good volume in Granada Group of 2.6m, the shares rising 5
to 260p, helped by a bullish presentation given by BSkyB, in which Granada
is a shareholder.
Euro Disney continued to benefit from its prospective inclusion in the CAC
40 index in Paris as French investors bought the stock ahead of the March 19
joining date. From that time, the stock can count on buying from
index-related funds. The shares climbed 20 to 1655p.

FT  10 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses gain ground
after dull start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR bourses overcame a dull start, while smaller markets were mixed,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT recovered from an early setback, achieving its turnround on gains
in a few blue chips, including Volkswagen, Daimler and Siemens. The DAX
index closed 4.30 higher at 1,750.25 after an intraday low of 1,739.36 and a
fall of 1.18 to 710.55 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume eased from DM5.6bn
to DM5bn.
Carmakers have performed well since mid-February, on good industry figures
and the rising dollar. Daimler rose another DM5.50 yesterday to DM770.50,
and VW by DM2.60 to DM375.50.
Some analysts said Siemens was looking strong technically. The shares rose
DM6.10 to DM696.10 yesterday but the real breakthrough was on February 21
when it cleared DM675, breaking out of a medium-term chart downtrend.
Siemens was also in demand ahead of its dividend which is due to be paid
this week. However, investors waiting for the big three chemicals may have
to be patient: BASF's directors are due to decide whether to keep or cut the
DM13 dividend today, but the official announcement is not expected before
March 19.
PARIS was surprisingly firm, as special situations dominated in the absence
of one strong theme. The CAC-40 index rose 9.37 to 1,976.28 in moderate
turnover of just over FFr2bn.
Euro Disney added FFr1.50 to FFr161.50, just below its all-time high of
FFr162, as the company's publicity machine went into top speed ahead of the
theme park's opening in April. The stock is being bought by index-linked
funds ahead of its inclusion in the CAC-40 index on March 19.
Elf recovered from last week's weakness, adding FFr4.80 to FFr369.90. After
the close, the government priced its sale of 2.3 per cent in Elf at FFr360 a
share, in line with expectations.
Friday's court ruling that Exor's voting rights in Perrier must be frozen
for two years lifted the stock in the mineral water company by FFr37 to
FFr1,605. Dealers said that the court's decision gave Nestle a better chance
in the takeover battle for Perrier.
LVMH, the luxury goods and drinks company linked with the brewer, Guinness,
rose FFr60 to FFr4,745 in decent volume of 16,760 shares. There was
speculation that the Salomon chairman Mr Warren Buffett, rumoured to be
building a stake in Guinness, might also be attracted to LVMH.
MILAN saw selling of Sip and weakness in Generali also weighed on the
market. The Comit index fell 2.11 to 512.76 in turnover estimated at L85bn
after Friday's L93bn.
Sip fell L23.50 or 1.7 per cent to L1,331.50 with a heavy 3m shares traded
as the market recognised that Sip would have to face more competition
following last week's ruling against it by Italy's anti-trust authorities.
Industrials resisted the downtrend, with Pirelli gaining L36 or 3.3 per cent
to L1,115 and Montedison putting on L20 to L1,393. Benetton added L121 to
L12,621.
Consob yesterday re-admitted Bonifiche Siele, Banca Nazionale
dell'Agricoltura (BNA), and Interbanca after a controversy over ownership
was cleared up. BNA fell to L5,380 from L5,600 on February 25.
AMSTERDAM eased ahead of this week's batch of 1991 results. The CBS Tendency
Index fell 0.1 to 127.9 in light turnover of Fl 414.2m.
DSM added Fl 4.40 after announcing better-than-expected 1991 net profits.
But the stock ended just 20 cents up at Fl 112.50 in the day's heaviest
trading as investors took heed of the company's cautious comments.
The brewer Grolsch, expected to release its 1991 results tomorrow, gained Fl
2.50 to Fl 198.50 after Heineken's pleasing results last week.
STOCKHOLM focused on SCA which sold its power subsidiary, Bakab, for
SKr11.45bn. SCA's B closed SKr7 higher at SKr114; B shares in its fellow
forestry group, Modo, jumped SKr15 to SKr240 on rumours that SCA will use
the sale proceeds to bid for it. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 6.1 to
989.3, a new 1992 high, in volume of SKr405m after SKr533m.
LISBON built on last week's 6.7 per cent gain, the BTA index closing up 31.2
at 2,072.3. Investors have been encouraged by pleasing provisional 1991
results.
BRUSSELS was broadly lower but the holding company, SGB, bucked the trend.
The Bel-20 Index fell 13.18 or 1.1 per cent to 1,201.84. SGB rose BFr15 to
BFr2,205 while its non-ferrous metals and mining unit, ACEC-Union Miniere,
rose BFr25 to BFr2,450.
COPENHAGEN saw DDL, part-owner of SAS, rise another DKr190 to DKr3,020 on
SAS's planned sale of its stake in the Inter-Continental hotels chain. The
CSE index rose 0.91 to 344.92.
VIENNA tumbled to its lowest level in nearly four weeks, the ATX index
dropping 22.62, or 2.1 per cent to 1,039.45. Last week's arrest of an
Austrian banker in the US on money-laundering charges weighed on the market.

FT  10 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): By-election defeat
brings Nikkei closer to 20,000

Tokyo
THE RULING Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) defeat in an upper-house
by-election in northern Japan led to political uncertainty yesterday, and
share prices declined on selling by corporations and investment trusts,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei index closed 195.31 lower at 20,797.68 after opening at the day's
high of 20,989.78 and reaching a low of 20,696.06.
Volume shrank to 180m shares from Friday's 250m. Declines outnumbered
advances by 772 to 191, with 145 issues unchanged. The Topix index fell
18.02 to 1,502.43, the lowest level since November 1986, and in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index dipped 3.63 to 1,141.94.
Investor confidence deteriorated following the loss of the LDP candidate in
the House of Councillors' by-election in the Miyagi prefecture over the
weekend. The result led to pessimism about additional by-elections scheduled
for this month and for April, and about the upper house elections to be held
in July.
Last Friday's decline on Wall Street and a weaker yen were other factors
discouraging market participants. Institutions also refrained from trading
ahead of this Friday's March future contract settlement.
Traders said investors were unsettled by the possibility of the Nikkei
falling below the critical 20,000 level. 'Investors are more cautious as the
index approaches 20,000, since it is an important technical point,'
commented Mr Chris Newton at James Capel.
A total of 182 issues hit their lows since the beginning of 1991, including
Nippon Steel, off Y10 at Y321. Corporate investors, which had been leading
buyers of large-capital blue chips, continued to liquidate holdings ahead of
the March year-end book closing. Foreign investors, reducing exposure to
high-technology issues on earnings concern, were seen selling Matsushita
Electric Industrial, which fell Y40 to Y1,270.
Bio-technology related stocks, active last week on trading by short-term
investors, lost ground on profit-taking. Okamoto Industries, the leading
prophylactic maker, which had been in favour because of its link with the
Aids prevention theme, retreated Y40 to Y1,240, and Mochida Pharmaceutical
shed Y70 to Y3,930.
Fujisawa Pharmaceutical ended Y70 up at Y1,360 after a day's high of Y1,440,
rising on rumours that the company's immuno-supressant drug was effective in
combating the HIV virus.
In Osaka, the OSE average weakened 311.19 to 22,319.18 in volume of 84.2m
shares. The index fell on small-lot selling, while activity centred on
cross-trading by investors looking to lock in profits ahead of the year-end
book closing.
Roundup
RELIEVING the gloom in the region yesterday were Bombay and, to a lesser
extent, Seoul.
BOMBAY resumed trading after a five-day break, and the BSE index set yet
another record high as it jumped 74.83 or 2.2 per cent to 3,547.61.
The market had closed to enable brokers to complete pending settlements amid
rumours of payment defaults, following a three-day gain of 22 per cent after
the budget on February 29.
Brokers said volume was low, but that buying pressure focused on shares
whose weighting in the index is relatively high.
SEOUL saw gains in large manufacturing stocks as the composite index put on
3.53 to 628.02 in turnover of Won264.8bn. The rally was led by Hyundai
subsidiaries, many of which soared to their daily limit highs, as the
political initiative by Chung Ju-yung, Hyundai's founder, seemed to be
gaining public acceptance.
HONG KONG fell again in thin trading, dragged down by persistent rumours
that HSBC Holdings, parent company of Hongkong Bank, will announce a rights
issue with its results today.
The Hang Seng index closed 60.27 or 1.3 per cent lower at 4,848.63 following
Friday's 55-point decline, and turnover contracted from HKDollars 2.29bn to
HKDollars 1.83bn. HSBC topped the active list and finished HKDollars 1.25
down at HKDollars 41.25.
SINGAPORE saw negative sentiment spill over from last week as the Straits
Times Industrial index fell 16.10 to 1,429.65 in turnover up from SDollars
77.4m to SDollars 86.0m.
Profit-taking, mixed corporate results and concern over Singapore's economic
growth prospects were all said to have affected sentiment.
NEW ZEALAND was depressed by Carter Holt plans to raise about NZDollars 400m
through a rights issue, in addition to spinning off its seafood unit to
strengthen its financial position.
Carter Holt dropped 18 cents to NZDollars 2.22 and the NZSE-40 index fell
14.59 to 1,445.89.
AUSTRALIA suffered its fifth consecutive fall, the All Ordinaries index
closing 6.5 lower at 1,598.2. A holiday in Melbourne diminished interest,
and turnover thinned from ADollars 181m to ADollars 117m.
TAIWAN reported dumping of bank shares as the weighted index sank 63.50 to
4,923.03, after a decline of only 1.55 on Saturday. Investors were afraid
that banks would be depressed by hectic sales in upcoming sessions as
investors raised cash for the government's public offering of 160m shares in
the International Commercial Bank of China.
BANGKOK was led down by real estate issues and blue chips as the SET index
fell 10.03 to 797.62. Turnover was Bt3.98bn, its lowest in a month.

FT  10 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Finland and Italy lead the global
decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Global equities eased last week in spite of Wall Street reaching a record
high on Tuesday. Both the US and Japan suffered falls of around 2 per cent,
leaving the FT-Actuaries World index 1.7 per cent lower on the week in local
currency terms.
The prospects for the world's leading markets continue to diverge. Friday's
bigger than expected rise in February non-farm payrolls on Friday has added
weight to the US recovery story. Furthermore, the US stock markets are
likely to remain buoyant as low interest rates encourage individuals to
switch their funds out of bank deposits into equities.
By contrast, there are few redeeming features in the Tokyo stock market.
Investor hopes for a cut in the official discount rate are regularly
disappointed, and sentiment has been dented by the steady decline in the yen
against the dollar in spite of repeated intervention in the foreign exchange
markets by the Bank of Japan. In its weekly report, Nomura International
says that under these conditions it is difficult to foresee the market being
able to sustain a rally. Indeed, the consensus opinion is that the market
will drift lower in thin volume.
Scandinavia supplied the best and the worst performers of the week. Norway
and Sweden vied for the best performing slot of the week as attention
switched to the laggards. Sweden had risen by only 5.8 per cent by the end
of February and Norway was 0.9 per cent below end-1991 values.
Finland dropped 5.8 per cent in local currency terms, but Ms Taina Uljas of
Kleinwort Benson said this was to be expected after the sharp rise in
January and February. In the first two months of this year, the Finnish
market climbed by 19.2 per cent on the FT-A world indices, well ahead of the
6.8 per cent rise for the whole of Europe.
Ms Uljas says the recent buying spree in Finland has been overdone,
considering that an upturn in the economy will not emerge until the end of
the year. Investors have also been worried by news that the government has
set up a new fund to support the banking sector in case of a crisis. Reports
that banks will not be allowed to increase their lending, which would hamper
an economic recovery, also weighed on the market.
Ms Uljas expects the market to remain weak until the second quarter, when
favourable economic data are expected to attract the buyers back, especially
into forestry stocks.
Italy, rapidly becoming the sick man of Europe, followed Finland with a 4.2
per cent fall. The market was dealt a serious blow by President Francesco
Cossiga's decision to scupper an important car insurance reform, which would
have made the sector more profitable for insurers. Also, volume has
virtually dried up ahead of the general election in April.
Pastorino and Partners, a leading Milanese brokerage, says last week's
performance offers investors little comfort for the market's medium-term
prospects. However, it adds that the current climate of uncertainty and the
oversold nature of the market make straddle options attractive.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Nerves slow trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK money market had a nervous and uneventful session, with all attention
fixed on today's Budget, and the performance of sterling.
Rates eased slightly, but dealers said this reflected little more than the
completion of the process of trimming their positions and squaring their
books that most operators began last week.
Volumes were higher initially as routine rollovers were sorted out at the
start of the week, but little remained after this except to cope with
the day's funding.
Although good sense might militate against it, and the Bank of England and
treasury were yesterday reported to be opposed, the possibility of a base
rate cut has not, however, been entirely ruled out.
'No government has won an election with base rates higher than 10 per cent
since 1974,' said one economist. 'If opinion polls start going in favour of
the Labour Party there may have to be just as much intervention to support
sterling at 10 1/2 per cent as there would have been at 10 per cent.'
The three-month interbank rate eased to 10 7/16 -10 5/16 per cent, from 10
1/2 -10 3/8 , and rates through to one year dropped around  1/16 per cent.
The March short sterling contract was three basis points firmer at 89.63, as
was the June contract, at 89.82.
The daily shortage was estimated by the Bank of England at a comparatively
small Pounds 250m. Outflows of liquidity via Pounds 810m of treasury bills
and maturing assistance and Pounds 310m for repurchase by the market, along
with Pounds 175m below-target bankers' balances from Friday, were partly
covered by Pounds 405m of Exchequer transactions, and a Pounds 645m fall in
note circulation.
The Bank did not operate on the early round, but at midday took out a large
part of the shortage - revised up to Pounds 300m - by purchasing Pounds 250m
of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
The forecast was further increased to Pounds 350m in the afternoon, and the
Bank bought another Pounds 103m of bank bills to cover the shortage.
The overnight rate, which had stood at only 10 1/2 -10 3/8 per cent before
the forecast, eased to 9-8 per cent after midday.
German call money rates were unchanged from Friday's 9.60/65 per cent,
although activity is expected to pick up later this week when tax payments
begin draining funds from the system.

<TEXT>
A PANEL of rubber marketing experts yesterday began a week-long meeting here
to review the International Natural Rubber Organisation's buffer stock
operations, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur.
The ad hoc group, set up in January by the Inro council at the request of
the US, will study the market impact and cost-effectiveness of Inro buying
and selling rubber, one delegate said.
The group comprises rubber traders and officials from Indonesia, Japan,
Malaysia, Thailand, the European Community and the US.
The panel will recommend possible changes to the Inro's operations at the
next regular council meeting from May 19 to 27.
The May meeting is expected to reconsider future talks to negotiate the
International Natural Rubber Agreement, which is administered by Inro.
Producer and consumer members of Inro are divided over whether to start
talks to negotiate a new pact to replace the current five-year Inro, which
can be extended by another two years beyond December 1993. The producers,
led by Malaysia, have said they are pushing for early Inra talks.

London's robusta coffee market closed with substantial gains but below the
day's highs as the New York market, after first slipping back, continued
Friday's rally. Traders said the support in the US was due to roaster and
commission house buying between 69.50 and 70.50 cents a lb in near May.
There was no fresh news from Brazil after last week's vote by Brazilian
producers to open talks on a return to an international coffee agreement.
London cocoa drifted to fresh 6 1/2 -month lows; the market is awaiting
indications on the size of the Ivorian mid-crop, which could be higher than
previous estimates of about 100,000 tonnes. On the LME copper prices rallied
back above support levels in the afternoon, aided by gains in New York. Most
other metals finished a routine day lower. Three-month zinc dropped below
the psychological Dollars 1,200 level, extending earlier declines, with
sell-stops pushing the market to the day's lows. Three-month aluminium fell
below support at Dollars 1,300 to trade last at Dollars 1,291 a tonne. New
York cotton futures were at contract lows at midday on bearish fundamentals.
Analysts cited market talk that China had increased its crop output to about
26m bales, 2.6m bales more than the USDA projected.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: End of silver glut forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SILVER STOCKS, now at record levels, could be eliminated by the year 2,000.
But prices would rise before then as investors saw the possibility that
substantial supply deficits might build up, said Mr Richard Osborne,
chairman of Asarco, the US integrated metals producer, yesterday.
He pointed out that 1991 was the sixth consecutive year of growth for silver
consumption and the second year in a row in which consumption had exceeded
supply.
'If prices stay low and if consumption and supply continue to grow at their
current rates, we expect that the historically high level of stocks that
exist today will be exhausted and we will begin to experience large deficits
of supply,' he said at a meeting with the Association of Mining Analysts in
London.
'However, it has been the role of the investor to recognise these types of
trends ahead of time. We believe that the investor will recognise this trend
earlier and begin the process whereby prices will rise, which will then
bring the needed silver to the market place.'
Western world industrial silver consumption last year increased by 2.4 per
cent to 512m troy ounces while output of newly mined and recycled refined
silver increased by only 0.9 per cent to 505m ounces.
This left visible refined silver stocks at 293.5m ounces, equivalent to 30
weeks of consumption.
Those high stock levels continued to hit silver prices in 1991 and they fell
for the fourth successive year by 16 per cent from an average of USDollars
4.82 an ounce to Dollars 4.04.
Asarco produced 13.6m ounces of silver last year (11m ounces for its own
account) most of it as a by-product of copper, lead or zinc mining. Like
many other primary silver mining companies, it closed some capacity last
year. The Coeur silver mine in Idaho was shut down temporarily because of
low prices, causing a 7 per cent fall in Asarco's total silver output.
Questioned about the potential threat to conventional photography - which
accounts for about half of silver's industrial consumption - by electronic
imaging techniques, Mr Osborne suggested this had been overplayed in the
past. It was unlikely that electronic still cameras would make much of an
impact in the market for another ten years.

FT  10 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Strong European demand for World Bank's
yen deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE World Bank's long-awaited global bond offering in yen
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the first of its kind - was launched yesterday to a strong reception from
investors, particularly in Europe.
Lead managers of the Y250bn, 10-year issue said the bonds could have been
sold two and a half times over at the indicated price range, of 17 to 19
basis points below the yield on the benchmark No 129 Japanese government
bond.
Demand for the issue was particularly strong from the UK and continental
Europe: early indications there suggested the bonds could have been sold at
a yield of more than 20 basis points below the benchmark yield.
The slightly more generous pricing range was chosen to give the bonds wider
distribution. About half of the issue has been sold provisionally in Europe,
with 20 per cent going to Japan and 10 per cent in other Far East centres.
US investors are expected to take 15 to 20 per cent.
Bankers said there was little switching out of Japanese government bonds to
take up the issue, though the yield on the No 129 rose slightly on the day.
For international investors, the bonds are more attractive than those in the
government market. They are free from withholding tax and there is no need
to switch between issues to keep abreast of the current Japanese government
benchmark.
Given the strength of demand for the bonds the formal pricing, to take place
today, is expected to result in a spread of 19 basis points below the No
129. At that level, the bonds would yield 5.37 per cent with interest
calculated on a semi-annual basis, compared with the 5.435 per cent yield on
the No 129 yesterday when calculated on a simple basis.
That would put the yield around seven basis points below the Japanese
Development Bank's Y120bn Euroyen benchmark issue last summer, accounted for
by the greater liquidity and broader distribution of the World Bank issue.
The scale of demand for the issue is likely to flush out other Euroyen
issues in the coming days, bankers said. 'There is no way all the yen demand
is fulfilled by this issue,' one said.
Elsewhere, the European Investment Bank came with a tightly-priced CDollars
500m issue which, at a yield of just 13 basis points over the relevant
government benchmark, appeared to be targeted once again at the traditional
Italian buyers of the EIB's paper.
The spread on the 10-year issue was well below that on other Canadian dollar
issues - Ontario Hydro's global bond, for instance, which is yielding some
60 basis points more than the EIB paper. The pricing appeared to have been
determined largely by the familiar popularity of EIB bonds to Italian
investors, whose freedom from withholding tax on the borrower's issues is
expected in some quarters to disappear at some stage this year.
Also, the bonds have the added attraction of a coupon close to current
interest levels, at 8.875 per cent, and so benefit compared with high-coupon
existing issues, which trade at a premium and so carry an implicit capital
loss.
In other issues, Deutsche Bank stepped in to launch an Ecu300m, seven-year
issue, taking advantage of the continued delay in the rumoured Ecu1bn issue
for Denmark, which has yet to appear.
Demand in the sector had built up to a level which allowed Deutsche, issuing
in the name of Deutsche Bank Finance NV, to sell the paper with little
apparent resistance at a yield of 8.4 per cent, around the level of an EIB
issue with a coupon of 9 per cent also due 1999.
Two floating-rate note issues from Italian financial institutions - Cariplo,
the AA1-rated savings bank and Isveimer, the unrated credit institution -
were launched with widely different spreads. At a spread of 37 basis points
over six-month Libor, Isveimer's Dollars 150m, three-year issue was said to
have sold out during the day. Cariplo's Dollars 200m, five-year deal was
launched with a spread of 17.5 basis points over Libor
In yesterday's report on the new agreement on exchange of clearing
information between Cedel and Euroclear, the two European clearing houses,
it was reported that Cedel had initially 'resisted' the concept of delivery
versus payment (DVP). In fact, the disagreement between Euroclear and Cedel
was over the definition of what constitutes DVP.
Cedel had always advocated that the concept of DVP, which is absent from the
original 1980 agreement, should be included in the new bridge agreement.

FT  10 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Japan's futures, options
charges to double
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMMISSIONS on stock futures and options trading on Japan's stock exchanges
will be doubled from March 23.
The increase is the first in commission on futures and options contracts in
Japan. The move comes as a surge in trading in the Nikkei 225 futures listed
on the Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) has been blamed for the price
volatility in the underlying cash market on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE).
The TSE raised margins on arbitrage trading between the futures and cash
markets three times last year.
The OSE denied the move was designed to limit activity in the derivatives
markets. 'The price difference in commissions between the futures and cash
markets is too large, and is unfair,' it said. For example, commission on
cash stock trading worth Y100m would total Y385,000, while commissions on
Y100m worth of futures would be Y40,000.
The announcement comes amid debate on liberalisation of fixed-cash stock
commissions. Market participants said trading on the Nikkei futures last
Friday was not affected by the measures, announced that day, but it
predicted negative long-term effects. 'The rise in commissions will drive
small-lot players away, reducing market liquidity,' said a derivatives
trader at a leading US brokerage.
The move is also expected to drive business to offshore markets - such as
the Singapore International Monetary Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange - which offer trading in Nikkei 225 futures. Trading in Simex's
Nikkei 225 contracts has surged during the past two months, with daily
average volume rising from last year's 3,045 contracts to last month's
6,789. Costs of trading on the Simex will be around half of that of the OSE

The move will affect brokerage commissions of the OSE Nikkei 225 futures and
options, TSE's Topix futures and options, and Nagoya's Option 25.

THYSSEN, the large German steel and engineering combine, is issuing a
multi-currency DM1bn commercial paper programme, Commerzbank said, Reuter
reports from Frankfurt.
The programme envisages drawdowns of up to DM1bn, or the equivalent in any
other currency, as long as there are no restrictions imposed by the relevant
central bank or other authorities.
Commerzbank said the funds raised would help cover operating costs.
Royal Bank of Scotland has had its long-term rating downgraded by IBCA, the
European-based credit-rating agency.
The rating has been lowered from AA to AA- because of 'the continuing
pressure on earnings and the decline in asset quality' resulting from the
slump in the UK economy.

FT  10 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Brokers association expected

<TEXT>
THE Sterling Brokers Association (SBA), a City of London trade grouping, is
expected to disband, after a meeting later this month to vote on the issue.
Mr Tony Alwright, of Tullet &amp; Tokyo, who chairs the association, declined to
comment further. However, it is widely expected that the SBA will come under
the umbrella of the Foreign Exchange and Currency Deposit Brokers
Association after being disbanded.
A representative of the SBA sits on the Bank of England's joint standing
committee on the money markets. However, the Foreign Exchange and Currency
Deposits Brokers Association also has representation on the committee, so
the role as a conduit between the Bank of England and the market could be
maintained.
According to brokers, the SBA, which represents a small sector of the
industry with only around half a dozen big players, has 'no real teeth',
since it has no regulatory powers. The Bank of England supervises brokers.

HENDERSON Administration Group, the UK fund management group, has taken a 25
per cent interest in Sabre, the managed futures fund specialist, at a cost
of Pounds 1m. Henderson has also taken a four-year option to acquire a
further 26 per cent interest in the company.
Henderson decided, in a strategic review 18 months ago, to invest in
specialist fund management companies complementary to its own business,
according to Mr Jeremy Edwards, managing director. Further such investments
or acquisitions are planned.
The choice of Sabre as its first investment, however, reflects a new
awareness in the UK of the potential growth of the managed futures fund
industry, which now has an estimated Dollars 20bn under management in the
US, and is attracting more interest in Japan and the Middle East, but is
still in its infancy in Europe.
Managed futures funds use futures and options to invest in a broad range of
markets using sophisticated techniques.
'Managed futures is an area we regard as offering significant international
growth potential, and Sabre, with its long-standing record, investment
experience and techniques is well positioned to benefit from that growth,'
said Mr Edwards.
Henderson has Pounds 8bn of funds under management.
Mr Peter Swete, managing director of Sabre, said Henderson's international
marketing and distribution muscle would prove a valuable asset for Sabre,
which would like to expand its Japanese business, and will also focus more
closely on the Middle East and parts of Europe.
Sabre, which now manages close to Dollars 100m of funds, has produced
average annual returns of 17 per cent since its inception. It was founded by
Mr Swete and Mr Robin Edwards in 1982 and specialises in the discretionary
management of funds using the currency, financial and commodity futures
markets.
Mr Robin Holland-Martin and Mr Rupert Carnegie, of Henderson, will join the
Sabre board, but Sabre will continue to be run as a separate company.

FT  10 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Brazilian bank to expand
overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRASILIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO do Brasil, Brazil's largest bank, is to step up its overseas
operations to take advantage of the country's re-emergence into the
international financial community. This follows its recent accords with the
International Monetary Fund and the Paris Club.
'We believe Brazil will take off this year and we want to make sure we're at
the vanguard,' said Mr Emilio Garofalo, the bank's international director.
As a start, the bank plans a Dollars 150m Eurobond issue next month, in what
will be its first entry on the international capital markets since 1981. Mr
Garofalo said the bank hoped to lead Eurobond issues of Brazilian private
companies, and has already had requests for Dollars 400m.
'The principle objective is to prolong the debt profile of Brazilian
companies so they are paying 12 or 13 per cent interest per annum, which,
while high by world standards, is low by Brazilian standards.'
It also plans to create a new European bank, with headquarters in Brussels,
to co-ordinate its 12 European agencies. 'We want to be in position to
benefit from the new unified Europe with access to credit lines,' said Mr
Garofalo.
He said to stimulate Japanese investment, a Japan desk would be set up in
the main Sao Paulo branch, and a Brazil desk in the Tokyo office.
'We want to take advantage of the extraordinary upsurge in interest in
Brazil. We have branches all across the country so we know Brazil best and
intend to be investors' first port of call.'
Mr Garofalo said the bank was also capitalising on the large number of
Brazilians now living abroad, and the increase in international operations
by Brazilian companies attempting to compensate for the domestic crisis of
recent years.
As a result, the net worth of the bank's foreign branches has grown from
Dollars 925.6m in 1986 to Dollars 3.09bn last year. Mr Garofalo described
the bank's liquidity as 'the most tranquil in its history'.
'We have Dollars 6bn in Brazilian debt, but Dollars 6bn of resources; so for
the first time we do not need funding to sustain our portfolio.'
However, the bank is under scrutiny by the federal audit tribunal, which is
demanding increased efforts to collect Dollars 1.56bn in debts owed by sugar
mill owners and fuel alcohol producers. A court could order the blocking of
the bank's accounts.

FT  10 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Salomon launches election
hedge

<TEXT>
SALOMON Brothers International has issued 2,000 put and 2,000 call warrants
on 10-year gilts. They are being marketed as instruments for hedging against
volatility created by the uncertainty surrounding the UK general election,
writes Tracy Corrigan.
The warrants mature in nine months, and so offer greater time value than is
available on the exchange-traded market, where the only liquid options
mature in June, according to Salomon Brothers. The warrants can be exercised
at any time during their nine-month life.
According to Mr Philippe Katz, of Salomon's arbitrage origination desk, the
volatility priced into the market ahead of this election is much lower than
ahead of the 1987 general election, even though the outcome this time is
less clear-cut. Consequently, it is cheaper for investors to hedge against
market movements.
Salomon reported a broad base of investor views: some investors bought call
options, on the expectation that the Conservatives would win and the gilt
market would rally; others bought the puts, taking the view that a Labour
victory could provoke a sterling crisis.

GENCOR, the South African mining and industrial group, yesterday said
shareholders subscribed for 97.8 per cent of shares offered under its R2bn
(Dollars 714.2m) rights issue, Reuter reports.
Its holding company Gencor Beherend will take up the balance in terms of its
underwriting commitment.
It said that the rights issue was well supported, despite uncertain market
conditions caused by the pending referendum on political reforms and the
financial rand investment currency moving against UK investors.

<TEXT>
HONGKONG Electric, the monopoly supplier of electricity to Hong Kong Island
controlled by Hutchison Whampoa, has reported earnings net of tax and
transfers to a government scheme of control, up 17.6 per cent to HKDollars
2.3bn (USDollars 298m) in the year to December 1991 from HKDollars 1.9bn in
1990.
This performance was achieved on turnover up 12.2 per cent to HKDollars
4.86bn from HKDollars 4.33bn. A final dividend of 44 cents was declared
which, with the interim of 26 cents, makes 70 cents for the year - up 15 per
cent on 1990's 61 cents. Mr Simon Murray, the company's chairman, said
barring unforeseen circumstances he anticipated a similar growth in profits
and dividends in 1992.
He said that in 1991 the company's electricity sales had risen 5.8 per cent
over 1990. This was in line with the company's long-term forecast of 5 per
cent to 7 per cent growth in electricity demand on Hong Kong Island.
Mr Murray said that Hongkong Electric's 1990-95 HKDollars 15bn capital
spending programme was continuing. During the first half of this year the
company planned to commission a new 350 MW coal fired power station  - Lama
Unit 6 - which it has been testing since December. Later in the year it will
begin its Lama Stage III expansion plan which calls for the construction of
the company's next 350 MW coal fired unit.
Mr Murray said the company's property development was proceeding well and
that these activities made a useful contribution to profits, although the
land bank of one of its associates, Secan, will only contribute for the next
four years.

<TEXT>
EUROC, the Swedish building materials group, yesterday reported a 73 per
cent fall in profits after financial items to SKr151m (Dollars 24.9m) for
1991 due to the recession in the construction industry.
It proposed cutting its dividend from SKr3.60 to SKr2 as it predicted
earnings could continue to decline this year.
Euroc blamed most of the profit fall on lower results from foreign
operations, including Castle Cement in the UK, Valenciana in Spain and
Scancem International in the US, which account for half the company's sales,
which fell by 9.5 per cent to SKr10.4bn.
Restructuring costs also increased from SKr39m to SKr115m as it eliminated
1,800 jobs in 1991, which reduced its labour force to 7,500. It plans to cut
another 500 jobs this year.
Euroc's cement business reported the biggest earnings decline with a 93 per
cent drop to SKr39m, while profits for building materials were halved to
SKr204m.

FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: CHH to float unit and cut
dividend

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CARTER Holt Harvey (CHH), New Zealand's largest forestry group, is to float
its sea food processing subsidiary Sealord, cut its dividend from next year
and raise NZDollars 400m (USDollars 222.2m) through a one-for-seven rights
issue in what it says is the final phase of its recapitalisation programme.
This package of measures, which will raise around NZDollars 1bn, is instead
of the previously announced plan to sell its Chilean forestry assets owned
by its Copec subsidiary. Mr Richard Carter, chief executive, said the
directors believed it was in the company's best long-term interests to
retain that investment.
Mr Carter, who is to retire shortly following the appearance of
International Paper of the US, as a big shareholder in CHH and is to take
over managing the company, had previously said Sealord would not be sold.
He said the earlier decision to sell Copec had been made for financial
reasons. The directors now believed the alternative refinancing package
would allow the group to retain this strategic investment.
Sealord, which took over Fletcher Fishing in 1990, is the country's largest
deep sea fishing company and also has a large share of the inshore fishery.
Mr Carter said the flotation would demonstrate Sealord's earnings
capability.
The two controlling shareholders in CHH, Brierley Investments and
International Paper, have underwritten the cash issue and will take up their
entitlements. In November the two companies formed a joint venture to
control 32 per cent of CHH.
Mr Carter said a decision to cut dividends for the 1992-93 year was in
recognition of the company's increased capital and international financial
climates.
He said the company was still expecting to make a profit of NZDollars 175m
for the year to March 1992.
