STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, plans a reorganisation of top tier
management and the establishment of two new units to develop and improve the
group's structure.
The reorganisation also represents a further clarification of roles and
distribution of responsibilities between the corporation, represented by the
executive board, and the management of the group's individual business
areas.
Most notable is the addition of two new executive vice-presidents, including
the appointment of Mr Roger O'Neil, former director and vice-president of
Mobil Europe London.
'President Harald Norvik, together with three executive vice presidents,
will make up the executive board of the Statoil group,' the company said.
Mr Peter Mellbye has been promoted to president of the natural gas division,
succeeding Mr Terje Vareberg who rises to executive vice-president.
Mr Tor Espedal will head the newly established labour relations unit, while
Mr Ottar Rekdal has been appointed senior vice president of the technology
division, also a new unit.
'I consider it natural to adapt the organisation in line with the Statoil
group's development.
'Statoil is on the eve of a strong period of growth in Norway and
internationally and, at the same time, sees its markets and the surrounding
world undergoing rapid changes,' Mr Norvik said.

FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Spotlight shines on
Rhone-Poulenc - The state may dispose of its majority holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc's announcement that the French state would probably reduce its
majority shareholding and might even sell its entire 56.9 per cent stake,
has cast an unaccustomed spotlight over the performance of the world's
seventh largest chemicals company.
Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, group chairman, believes ownership is no longer an
issue in France and that the difference between the political parties on the
subject is minimal. The discussion, he argues, is whether the state should
hold a minority interest or nothing at all.
'Whatever the conclusion, the situation will change. It could even change
before the legislative elections next year,' he said. He believed there were
plenty of people wanting to invest in the company.
Mr Fourtou will need to convince potential investors about the group's
ability to grow organically. Although the company's operating income rose
37.5 per cent to FFr6.27bn (Dollars 1.11bn) last year, most of that growth
was dependent upon the additional income from the acquisition of a 68 per
cent stake in Rorer, the US pharmaceuticals group.
The rest of the group performed poorly. Trading profits at the
non-healthcare operations actually fell FFr400m last year to FFr2.2bn on a
turnover of FFr56.2bn. Moreover, the ability of the healthcare division to
expand is also open to question. Only 13 per cent of growth in the health
division, which generated trading profits of FFr4.2bn, came from the
non-Rorer operations.
In spite of the recession, Mr Fourtou is nevertheless predicting the group's
operating income will increase by at least 20 per cent in both 1992 and 1993
 -an achievement that should make the company highly attractive in the
run-up to the government's sale.
Mr Fourtou expects the health division to continue to produce growth, though
not as great as last year when the Rorer acquisition helped boost sales by
23 per cent and trading profits by 210 per cent.
One of the objectives of the Rorer acquisition was to reduce the dependency
on the French market which is coming under increasing pressure from
government pricing constraints. Before the Rorer deal, about 75 per cent of
the health division's turnover was in France. Now it is about 33 per cent,
said Mr Fourtou.
'The highest increase proportionally will come from the specialities
operations which last year reported trading profits of only FFr100m on a
turnover of FFr14.8bn. This year it should make FFr700m, not because of an
upturn in the market, but rather because of synergies and productivity
improvements,' said Mr Fourtou.
Over the last 12 months, Rhone-Poulenc has sold some non-profitable
speciality businesses and closed about seven plants in the US.
There have also been widespread management changes in an effort to shake up
the division. Mr Fourtou believes the group has enormous potential to
generate profits over the next two to three years.
The remaining growth should come from an improvement in the fibres business
in Brazil, said Mr Fourtou. With a stronger US dollar and some growth in the
world economy, Mr Fourtou believes his target can be achieved.
Meanwhile, he plans to continue with his disposal programme and
cost-cutting. He admits the programme has not been as quick as he had hoped,
but he hopes to raise as much as FFr3bn this year and between FFr1.5bn and
FFr2bn in 1993. There has been a shortage of buyers, but he said he is
willing to spend time to ensure he achieves a good price. He refused to
detail which operations might be for sale.
This disposal programme should help achieve one of Mr Fourtou's main
priorities - to reduce the company's debts. Net debt has fallen from FFr34bn
in 1990 to FFr33.1bn at the end of last year. He plans to cut the debt to
equity ratio from 0.78 at the end of last year to close to 0.5 in 1993.
Mr Fourtou also expects to spend considerable time achieving synergies from
the acquisition binge at the end of the 1980s. He believes it could take
between three and five years. While he may not have much difficulty in
convincing the government to sell its stake over the next few years, he may
well find he has his work cut out convincing private investors to buy it.

MAGNA International, Canada's biggest independent car parts maker, continues
its recovery despite weak North American car production caused by the
recession.
For the second quarter to January the group reported net profits of CDollars
10.7m (USDollars 9m) or 26 cents a share, against losses of Dollars 2.3m, or
8 cents a year earlier. Sales were unchanged at Dollars 484m.
First-half profits came to CDollars 36.2m or 84 cents a share, against
CDollars 500,000 or 2 cents a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 1.1bn, up
12 per cent.
Magna, which also has several plants in Europe, benefited from a shift in
product mix, lower interest rates and lower capital spending. Assuming
conversion of CDollars 200m of convertible debentures, debt-equity ratio is
0.6:1.
The company is resuming common share dividends with a 10 cent cash payment
for the latest quarter. Magna in the latest period achieved a return on
equity of 11 per cent after returning from the brink two years ago.

<TEXT>
FORD'S Canadian subsidiary is reportedly close to a deal to export as many
as 125,000 cars to Argentina over the next two years from a plant in
Ontario.
The Canadian media reported yesterday that financing is still required for
the sale, which would be worth more than USDollars 1bn. A Ford spokesman
said that 'it's not quite a done deal from our end, but we are extremely
hopeful that the financing will soon be in place'.
The mid-sized Ford Tempos would be used as taxis in Argentina. Phoenix Plus,
a Toronto company which is brokering the sale, would buy the cars from Ford
and sell them through an association of Argentine taxi owners to individual
operators.
Mr Howard Wolle, president of Phoenix Plus, said the company is close to
securing loan guarantees from the national bank of Argentina.
If the deal goes through, 65,000 cars would be shipped this year, with the
possibility of another 60,000 in 1993. The order represents about 25 per
cent of the capacity of the Ford plant in Oakville, Toronto.

THE JAMAICAN government has sold its 39 per cent stake in the island's
largest commercial bank to a local insurance company and a building society
for the equivalent of USDollars 23m.
The government had promised last year that its stake in the National
Commercial Bank would be offered to the public this month, but Mr Hugh
Small, the finance minister, said there had been a 'disappointing' response
from financial institutions to underwrite the divestment.
'A partial underwriting could have led to a lack of confidence in the offer,
causing us to discount the price below the market,' the minister said. 'The
price we have negotiated is above the market and we are pleased with that.'
The purchasers, the Mutual Life Assurance Society and Jamaica National
Building Society, will pay half of the price in foreign currency and half in
Jamaican dollars.

<TEXT>
BCE and its telecom-munications subsidiary Bell Canada, the world's
18th-largest, is expected to join Financial Network Association, an
international alliance.
The alliance, led by MCI Communications of the US, will provide advanced
communication services to banks and investment firms and the complete
corporate networks on a global basis.
Bell Canada and Canada's other public carriers through Stentor, the renamed
Telecom Canada, will also join FNA. Stentor and MCI have confirmed moves to
offer integrated network services between world financial centres and
announcements are imminent.
For BCE, the alliance is part of a long-term strategy to expand into
providing telecom networks for large international businesses.
The western hemisphere leaders in developing this business are MCI and rival
AT&amp;T. The UK's BT leads the Syncordia international alliance.
BCE has taken management control of Teleglobe, the sole Canadian overseas
carrier and will soon control a systems integrator specialising in designing
computer and telecom networks for multinationals.
Bell Canada has talked to Singapore Telecom and the Unicom consortium,
trying to become a North American hub for international telecom traffic. The
challenge is to carry the North American part of Europe-Asia traffic at
rates competitive with the US.
Bell Canada is calling for complete deregulation of Canada's telecom
industry.
'Canadian traffic must be carried on Canadian facilities rather than US
networks,' said Mr Jean Monty, chairman.
'But the established carriers must be able to compete fully where market
forces prevail.'

<TEXT>
HJ Heinz, the Pittsburgh food group, yesterday posted a 12.2 per cent drop
in third-quarter net income, reflecting restructuring charges and higher
marketing costs.
Net income for the three months ended January 29 was Dollars 115.3m or 43
cents a share against Dollars 128.9m or 49 cents a year earlier. Sales were
essentially unchanged at Dollars 1.62bn against Dollars 1.61bn.
The company said the strength of the US dollar against foreign currencies
also contributed to the decline in the latest quarter.
Stripping out the impact of currency exchange rates, sales rose 5 per cent
in the latest quarter, reflecting volume increases in a number of brands,
including baby food, ketchup and cat food.
For the first nine months, Heinz's net income advanced 19.6 per cent to
Dollars 492.6m or Dollars 1.84 a share, including a one-off pre-tax gain of
Dollars 221m from the sale of Hubinger in June. A year earlier, the company
earned Dollars 411.9m or Dollars 1.55 a share. Sales eased to Dollars 4.71bn
from Dollars 4.81bn a year ago.
On Wall Street, shares in Heinz firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 37 in
moderate volume.
During the latest third quarter, the company's gross profits fell 3.4 per
cent to Dollars 604.9m from Dollars 626.1m. Selling, general and
administrative expenses were Dollars 390m against Dollars 388.1m in the 1990
quarter.
Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman, reiterated his forecast of growth of about 12
per cent in earnings per share and net income for the full year.

FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: SCA sells hydroelectric arm for
SKr11.45bn
</HEADLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCA, the Swedish forestry group, yesterday sold its hydroelectric subsidiary
Bakab to the Swedish energy group Sydkraft for SKr11.45bn (Dollars 1.88bn).
The deal will substantially reduce SCA's borrowings and strengthen
Sydkraft's position in the European power industry.
Explaining the background to the disposal, SCA said its need for owning
hydroelectric power sources had been reduced as it shifts from
energy-intensive raw pulp production to using recycled fibre for its growing
range of value-added wood-based products.
SCA added that it would net SKr6.7bn from the sale and as a result reduce
its long-term debt to SKr8.69bn from SKr17.77bn, while increasing its
equity/asset ratio from 29 per cent to 47 per cent.
SCA built up its large debt burden in the past few years in a corporate
acquisition spree through Europe, including the Pounds 1.05bn (Dollars
1.84bn) purchase of Reedpack in 1990.
In an attempt to reduce borrowings, SCA has already sold several
subsidiaries, including the pulp machinery company Sunds Defibrator, and
mortgaged half of Bakab's assets to the Swedish government-affiliated
National Pension Funds.
That mortgage will be transferred to Sydkraft as part of the preliminary
agreement.
The Bakab sale will also enable SCA to renew its acquisitions thrust as well
as finance current capital investment programmes.
The takeover by Sydkraft of SCA's hydroelectric facilities, which are in the
mountainous northern Swedish region of Norrland, will take place at the
beginning of 1993 with an initial payment of SKr7.95bn followed by five
annual payments of SKr700m each.
Sydkraft said its acquisition of Bakab will improve its competitive position
as the European electricity market becomes deregulated, providing increased
opportunities to sell power across national borders.
Sydkraft plans to provide electricity to the German power group Preussen
Elektra, which acquired a 10.5 per cent stake in Sydkraft last year. Bakab
accounted for about 9 per cent, or SKr1.10bn, of SCA's 1990 total invoicing.
The addition of Bakab's hydroelectric resources will also reduce Sydkraft's
dependence on nuclear power as its main source of electricity generation.
SCA said the deregulation of the electricity market in Sweden and the
European Community and the opening of borders within Europe had led 'to a
quickly changing situation' in the power sector.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEGUSSA, the German metals, chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, intends to
cut its labour force by a further 1,000 people by October 1993, as part of
its programme aimed at cutting costs and improving profitability.
The company, which holds its annual press conference today, intends to
achieve as many of the job cuts as possible through early retirement so as
to minimise redundancies. It said it wants to cut overheads by up to 25 per
cent at its Frankfurt-based parent company. Its worldwide labour force was
about 33,000 at the end of last October, a drop of 2,100 on the previous
year.
Degussa has already announced a sharp cut in its dividend payment to DM7
from DM11 a share after a drop in group net income of 33 per cent to DM99m
(Dollars 62m) in the year to September, 1991. Earnings per share slid to
DM12 from DM25.50. Before tax, profits were 44 per cent lower at DM179m.
The company's problems stem mainly from the slowdown in its export markets
at a time when competitive pressures have emphasised the high level of
German costs. The decline in the world motor industry has also affected
Degussa, which makes carbon black, used by the tyre industry, and produces
metals for catalytic converters.
Thus the company is keen to realign its operations by trimming the
workforce, cutting the number of business units, selling off peripheral
activities, and shifting some production to lower-cost countries. Its
restructuring programme, called Degussa 2000, began in 1989.

FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: DSM to hold payout despite fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HEERLEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, will pay an unchanged dividend despite a
sharp decline in profits caused mainly by shrinking margins in its
hydrocarbon and plastics businesses.
Net profit after extraordinary items plummeted 40 per cent to Fl 516m
(Dollars 275m) in 1991, while operating profit fell to Fl 630m from Fl
1.09bn the year before.
The hydrocarbon and polymers division - which in 1990 accounted for Fl 520m,
or nearly half, of total operating profit - saw its operating profit shrink
to just Fl 68m, of slightly more than 10 per cent of the group total. Two
other divisions, resins and energy, posted modest profit declines, while
basic chemicals managed to increase operating results by 10 per cent to Fl
267m.
Operating profit was also adversely affected by lower oil prices, which
produced inventory losses of Fl 100m compared with gains of Fl 100m the year
before.
Despite the downturn, DSM is to maintain its dividend at Fl 8 per share, the
level which has prevailed since the government floated its first tranche of
DSM shares on the Amsterdam stock exchange in 1989. However, the company,
which is still 32 per cent state-owned, will for the first time give
shareholders the option of receiving part of the final Fl 5.35 dividend in
shares rather than cash.
Mr Ad Timmermans, the group finance director, said DSM's dividend policy was
aimed at a stable payout. The high 1991 payout of 54.5 per cent of profits
compares with 20.4 per cent in 1989, a record year for profits, and 32.7 per
cent in 1990, producing an average dividend rate of 30.6 per cent since
privatisation.
The company declined to make a full-year forecast but said operating profit
in the first quarter of 1992 is expected to equal the average of the lower
third and fourth quarters of 1991, implying a year-on-year decline of 58 per
cent.
It added that DSM's new strategy of concentrating on core activities and
decentralising its operations would lead to annual cost savings of Fl 100m
to Fl 150m starting in 1993.

SOCIETE Generale de Surveillance (SGS), the world leader in product
inspection and testing services, posted a 3.3 per cent rise in net income
last year to SFr187.6m (Dollars 125.9m) and announced several moves to
improve relations with investors.
Mrs Elisabeth Salina Amorini, the chairman, said the results were 'very

The directors of the family-controlled group have proposed a 5.3 per cent
rise in dividends, to SFr40 per registered share and dividend right
certificate and SFr200 per bearer share.
They also plan five-for-one splits in the par value of the registered and
bearer shares to make them more tradeable.
In addition, the group is offering to exchange dividend right certificates,
which account for about 7 per cent of its market capitalisation, for bearer
shares at the rate of six certificates for five shares.
Revenues were up 9.7 per cent to SFr2.2bn, with acquisitions contributing
3.3 per cent of the growth, and cash flow improved 8.3 per cent to
SFr286.6m. The operating margin eased to 8.9 per cent from an exceptionally
strong 10.2 per cent.

FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Fall in price of steel hits SSAB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SSAB, the Swedish state-controlled steel concern which heads the list of
planned share sales by the government, yesterday reported a 77 per cent drop
in profits, after financial items, to SKr218m (Dollars 35.9m) for 1991.
Mr Leif Gustafsson, the SSAB president, blamed the sharp profit decline on a
15 per cent price fall for steel, reflecting a price war in Europe due to
excess production and a 20 per cent fall in demand in Sweden as the
recession deepened.
SSAB predicts steel consumption in Europe has bottomed out, but it sees no
signs of increased demand in 1992. Profits could improve if steel prices
recover due to increased demand in the US.
SSAB is to maintain an unchanged dividend of SKr6 as it prepares to become
one of the first state concerns to be completely privatised by the
conservative government.
SSAB also said all its shares will become non-restricted, allowing
foreigners full shareholding access to SSAB.
Group sales fell 12 per cent to SKr13.8bn, while the operating profit
dropped 75 per cent to SKr249m. SSAB Strip Products division, which was
SSAB's most profitable group in 1990 with profits of SKr280, suffered a loss
of SKr9m in 1991.

<TEXT>
BANQUE Indosuez, the fully owned merchant banking unit of France's Suez
group, yesterday announced a 13 per cent fall in net annual profits, hit by
a big write-down on an overvalued property purchase.
Net profits at the bank, which is mounting a joint bid for Perrier with the
Swiss food multinational Nestle, fell to FFr805m (Dollars 144.26m) last year
from FFr929m in 1990. This follows the previous year's 10 per cent profits
fall.
New provisions rose by more than 20 per cent over the same period, from
FFr1.29bn to FFr1.55bn, the main element in which was a FFr650m write-down
on the NMPP newspaper distribution building in Paris.
Banque Indosuez bought the building for FFr2.7bn in 1990, one of the city's
largest ever property deals, in the so-called 'golden triangle,' a
fashionable area near the stock exchange. The purchase took place just
before the central Paris market started to weaken.
The bank wrote down FFr100m for the building in last year's accounts and
says this completes the NMPP provisions.
More than half of the property, now being renovated, has attracted purchase
promises from French and foreign investors.
Within the overall provisions, FFr904m related to doubtful loans, down 24
per cent from the FFr1.19bn provided against loans in the previous year.
This was due to the quality of the bank's commercial and industrial loan
portfolio, said Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, chairman.
Operating profits were up 58 per cent to FFr1.37bn from FFr872m on a rise in
net banking by 17 per cent over the same period, to FFr10.93bn from
FFr9.32bn. 'Having produced strong growth in operating profits in 1991,
Banque Indosuez has piled up heavily its risk provisions,' said Mr
Jeancourt-Galignani.
He said it was remarkable that growth was spread across all the bank's
activities and geographical regions, except its Tokyo broking business,
which lost money.

PORSCHE, the German luxury sports car manufacturer under pressure from a
steep decline in profits, is managing to stay in the black at a time of
slack sales by cutting costs, Mr Arno Bohn, the chief executive, said in a
German press interview.
But he admitted that Porsche's administration was overweight and that the
company had contributed to its negative image, notably through failures in
motor sport and a rapid turnover of top management.
In the US, where sales collapsed last year to 4,400 cars from 9,100, the
company said Mr Brian Bowler had left as president of Porsche Cars North
America to be replaced by his deputy, Mr Frederick Schwab.
'The resignation was the result of differences over the direction of the
company's future efforts in the important US market,' Porsche said with no
elaboration.
When the company sold 50,000 cars a year in the mid-1980s, around 30,000
went to the US, Mr Bohn said. While the US market has fallen drastically -
first as a result of the stock market crash of 1987 and the dollar's
weakness, and then of the US recession - the company's sales elsewhere have
risen, especially in Germany and Japan.
For this year the company already forecasts a decline in car sales from the
26,200 sold last year. But Mr Bohn said Porsche could now break even by
selling around 21,000 cars a year compared with 29,000 two years ago.
Porsche is putting 4,000 of its 9,000 employees on short-time working up to
June and cutting its production workforce by 550 people.
Mr Bohn said the company, whose net profits fell by 70 per cent last year to
DM17m (Dollars 10.6m), would not undergo a rapid improvement in the next
year or two; this would take four to six years, as long as it took to
develop a new car.

FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Trygg-Hansa advances to SKr520m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRYGG-HANSA SPP Holding, the Swedish insurance group, yesterday reported
that its operating profit rose to SKr520m (Dollars 85.6m) for 1991 from
SKr97m in 1990, writes John Burton.
However, despite the powerful increase in net earnings the company is
pegging its dividend. This is to stay at SKr4 a share.
The steep upturn in profits reflected a 14 per cent increase in premium
income to SKr7.5bn and a 48 per cent rise in earnings in insurance
operations to SKr920m.
At the same time financial income provided the accounts with SKr345m against
a loss of SKr456m in 1990.
On a less positive note the company explained that it faced a new source of
concern in the shape of its 43 per cent shareholding in Gota, the Swedish
financial group. This caused a loss of SKr850m for Trygg-Hansa.
The group's consolidated capital increased by 24 per cent to SKr12.9bn last
year.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lower property profits and interest check
Thorntons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS not so much the high street recession as the dwindling of property
profits and increased interest charges that affected Thorntons, the
chocolate maker and retailer.
Pre-tax profit fell 7 per cent to Pounds 7.17m (Pounds 7.75m) on sales of
Pounds 50.5m (Pounds 46.2m) in the six months to January 11.
Operating profit inched ahead to Pounds 7.55m (Pounds 7.5m), but interest
costs rose to Pounds 478,000 (Pounds 210,000) and property profits fell to
Pounds 95,000 (Pounds 464,000) as the group got out of development.
Mr John Thornton, chairman and chief executive, said increased costs,
particularly shop rents, wiped out the gains made through sales growth and
improved productivity.
Christmas, which accounts for 30 per cent of sales, had been 'extremely late
and highly nerve-racking'.
But in the end like-for-like takings in the Thorntons shops were up by
nearly 9 per cent. Franchised outlets in greetings card shops had not done
so well and companies had cut back on gifts.
Retail turnover totalled Pounds 35.9m and the number of outlets reached 386.
Mr Thornton said the target was to have 650 within five years.
In France, where there are 59 shops under the Martial and Sunset names,
sales were virtually flat at Pounds 4.6m. Losses, which amounted to Pounds
850,000 last year, were being reduced. Meanwhile, the French ice cream
factory was helping to meet rising demand in the UK.
Sales of chocolates to private-label customers grew by 31 per cent. Overall
the commercial sales division contributed Pounds 9.9m (Pounds 7.8m) to
turnover.
A review of management had led to 50 jobs being cut, although some of the
people had been redeployed. About nine new managers were being recruited.
The changes, which would save Pounds 600,000 a year, carried a one-off cost
of Pounds 630,000. After a Pounds 250,000 profit on the sale of a shop in
the Champs Elysees, exceptional charges would total Pounds 380,000 for the
year.
The Pounds 2m disposal would also help turn net debt of Pounds 4m into a
probable cash surplus by July, said Mr Thornton, whose family owns 53 per
cent of the equity.
Earnings per share declined to 7.53p (8.01p). The interim dividend goes up
to 1.25p (1.2p).
COMMENT
Thorntons has proved itself to be one of the better small-company stocks and
the share price, up from 116p to 201p just before these results, has
responded after doing little since the May 1988 flotation. However, its
recession-resilient image has been a soured a smidgen by squeezed margins on
the commercial side and by soft demand between such treat-peaks as Christmas
and Valentine's Day. For the rest of this year the minuses, including rent
increases and redundancy costs, seem set to outweigh the pluses, which
should at last include a better performance in France. A pre-tax profit of
between Pounds 11m and Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 11.9m) gives a prospective p/e
of nearly 17 on yesterday's close of 200p. At this level, there may be some
profit taking, although the group's long-term prospects remain good.

Young Group, the opencast and drift coal miner, yesterday announced the
appointment to its board, with immediate effect, of Mr Brian Calver, a
mining engineer with extensive experience at board level with RTZ mining
subsiduaries.
Mr Calver has joined the USM-quoted company as chief operating officer, a
new post designed to strengthen Young's management team. He will report
directly to chairman and chief executive Mr Bob Young and is expected to
become a director.
Young Group, which last week announced it was facing reduced 1991 profits
and needed more working capital, is currently negotiating with its bankers
and major shareholders for additional finance.
The creation of the new post, intended to allow Mr Bob Young, the company's
founder, to concentrate on broader strategic issues, had been planned well
before the group's need for more working capital became public knowledge.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Going to work on a curate's egg - Robert
Louis-Dreyfus, who is nursing a limping but not crippled Saatchi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN JANUARY 1990 the unthinkable happened in the advertising world; Mr
Charles and Mr Maurice Saatchi relinquished management control of their
sprawling marketing services group to an outsider, Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus.
Some 16 months later he successfully pushed through a recapitalisation
scheme gaining Pounds 60m in new equity. Stage one - the prevention of the
group's financial collapse after its over-expansion - was over. Stage two -
the return to former glories - has hardly started.
The kind of clout the Saatchi brothers once enjoyed has gone and business is
tougher to get. Today, Saatchi, the world's second largest marketing
services group, will announce results for the 15 months to the end of
December 1991. Analysts are predicting group losses of up to Pounds 50m;
that figure is probably optimistic.
The losses are largely due to provisions against some 100,000 sq ft of empty
offices in the US and the UK and the deficit incurred through the winding-up
of a small agency in the US. But even without such exceptional items, the
group may register losses of Pounds 8.6m on revenue of some Pounds 720m,
down from 1990's Pounds 808m.
The reasons for such losses are complex; the fault lies partly in structure,
partly in morale, and partly in the collapse of advertising revenue
generally.
But there are indications that within three years the group could rise
phoenix-like from the ashes.
Structurally, the group is rather like a person with one leg shorter than
the other. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide (SSAW) and BSB Worldwide
(BSBW) are the group's two international agency networks. While SSAW strides
along, BSBW has been limping badly; as a result the group has a stumbling
gait.
Changing a self-reinforcing poor image of BSBW will be tricky. In November
1991 Marketing Week magazine published a survey of 150 advertisers who were
asked which agencies they most valued.
Saatchi took second place, after J Walter Thompson, and with Ogilvy &amp; Mather
third - both of which are subsidiaries of WPP, Saatchi's rival. But BSBW
slid from 10th in 1990 to 17th in 1991. BSB's New York office lost important
accounts, including Prudential, Fisher Price and Xerox. Mr Louis-Dreyfus has
restructured BSBW's New York management in order to stem the defections.
Furthermore, advertising revenue has been badly affected by economic
recession both in the UK and the US. Internationally, advertising revenue
dropped in real terms by some 3 per cent in 1991, the first such decline in
20 years. The worst fall was in the US, which according to Zenith (the
media-buying arm of Saatchi) experienced a 5.9 per cent real drop.
That particularly affects Saatchi; in 1990 its revenues were almost entirely
from advertising (93.4 per cent), with 52 per cent of that from the US
market.
Cost cutting has been necessary. Saatchi's operational staff has shrunk from
1989's level of more than 18,000 to 12,900 now; the severance bill for 1991
may total Pounds 15m. The redundancies have damaged but probably not
destroyed morale.
And the group appears to be winning important new business, about Dollars
270m (Pounds 153.4m) net of new accounts since January 1, including large
business from Toyota and BAT Industries. The only major client loss on the
horizon is Rover, from the already badly hit BSB Dorland agency.
Mr Charles Scott, chief operating officer, has the task of further
tightening financial control over the slimmed-down operation.
His view is that 1992, not 1991, should be the yardstick by which the new
management is judged. 'Since April 1991 we have been getting management
sorted out and the structure right. The 1991 results will show the impact of
everything that's been done up until now. Rather than looking at 1991's
results, 1992's will really show how well or badly the company operators
have done.'
In a sense the big pain came in March 1991 with the group's
recapitalisation. That removed the threat of having to redeem Pounds 211m of
Euro-preference shares in 1993. But the current share price of 16 1/2 p is a
far cry from mid-1989 (before the financial difficulties hit the group) when
it stood at about 300p.
Mr Scott's plans include the phased introduction of a system of payment by
results rather than the fat fixed salaries of old. 'It's a highly paid
industry and it would be foolish to try to change that overnight. But we are
engaged in trying to change the overall compensation breakdown of the
company. While it is not possible to lower fixed salaries, there will be a
higher variable component, in terms of annual bonuses,' says Mr Scott.
Salaries currently represent 60 per cent of Saatchi's fixed costs, an annual
bill of roughly Pounds 300m; in 1991 about 300 executives earned salaries of
Pounds 150,000 and above.
Saatchi - like many other troubled agencies - is also banking on the
probability of an upturn in global advertising spending this year. Between
0.7 and 5 per cent real growth in advertising expenditure in 1992 is
projected by different analysts, against an annual average 3.2 per cent
between 1970 and 1990.
Growth will not be through fresh acquisitions, says Mr Scott. He prefers
organic growth.
'Shareholders have taken a lot of pain because of the acquisition policy.
It's strongly my view that organic growth is high-quality growth,
acquisitions mean low-quality growth. Such drawing-in of horns is now an
industry commonplace.
The group has net debt of Pounds 225m. The first debt repayment of Pounds
20m is not due until December 1993, but the group could be cashflow positive
to the tune of Pounds 4m in 1992, and improving thereafter.
Mr Louis-Dreyfus wants to strengthen the long-term international
competitiveness of the group by building a third network around Campbell
Mithun Esty, the Minneapolis-based agency, and KHBB, the London agency, to
satisfy multinational client demands for a global service.
One problem overhanging the group - besides the difficulties in lowering
high fixed salaries of disgruntled executives - is, says a recently departed
Saatchi employee, that 'the holding company's size is just not justified'.
At an estimated cost of Pounds 20m annually, the somewhat bureaucratic head
office establishment may still need pruning.
Less immediate and less quantifiable worries might yet prove a threat.
If advertising expenditure does pick up, will we see a rash of disenchanted
staff leaving to set up their own agencies? What will Mr Louis-Dreyfus do if
BSBW in the US fails again this year, or if the incipient CME-KHBB network
fails to gel? And as media-buying in Europe becomes a more centralised
business, will the otherwise thriving Zenith begin to suffer?
In other words, the group is still in difficult flux, needing careful
nursing; only SSAW is holding its own in world rankings.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: UK side helps TDG advance to Pounds 38.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance in the UK helped Transport Development Group, Britain's
second largest haulier, report a small advance in profits from Pounds 38.2m
to Pounds 38.9m for the year to December 31.
However, extraordinary charges of Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 4m) forced the group
to dip into reserves to pay its dividend.
The bulk of the provisions were due to expected losses on the US operation,
which is up for sale. The closure costs of loss-making UK businesses
accounted for Pounds 6m of the charge.
The result was achieved on turnover up by almost Pounds 3.7m to Pounds
584.3m. Operating profits in the UK improved by Pounds 2m to Pounds 32.3m.
Sir James Duncan, chairman, said 'good housekeeping' in the storage division
had helped boost profits substantially. The hire business had also remained
profitable.
TDG's operations in France had taken a severe beating from recession in the
latter part of the year, with profits down by 66 per cent to Pounds 1.2m.
The return from continental Europe as a whole was Pounds 1m higher at Pounds
9.8m.
In the US, two of the three businesses had been sold, while the remaining
transport company, Willig Freight Lines, reported a loss. Sir James said TDG
was determined to pull out of the US.
The group intended to keep a tight rein on capital expenditure, said Sir
James, which totalled Pounds 64m in 1991 compared with Pounds 81m last time.
So far the group had seen no sign of a pick up in any of its markets, he
added. In France 'it is even getting a little tougher'.
The chairman stressed the strength of the balance sheet. Gearing is just one
point higher at 18.8 per cent.
Earnings per share were virtually static at 17.6p (17.7p). A same again
final divided of 6.5p is proposed to maintain the total at 9.5p.
COMMENT
TDG seems to be heading down the right road. Cost-cutting is estimated to be
saving between Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 2m a year. The biggest cost benefits
are likely to come in the UK, with little movement up or down in continental
Europe. The sorry picture painted of France offers no hope of an easier
recessionary ride there, but there are expansion opportunities elsewhere.
Meanwhile, the almost 20 per cent stake held by Proventus, the Swedish
investor, will help to buoy the shares as punters look for a potential
bidder. But the most obvious candidates - such as P&amp;O - have their own
problems and are unlikely to approach TDG for a while yet. Forecasts of
Pounds 43m for next year include a touch of organic growth and some cost
savings benefits. The multiple of 13.7 leaves shares fully valued - at least
until until Proventus sheds its stake.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Expanding Takare jumps 72% to Pounds 7.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKARE, the expanding nursing group for elderly and chronically ill
patients, yesterday announced a 72 per cent increase in pre-tax profits,
from Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 7.5m, for the year 1991.
After raising Pounds 74m last September in further equity and debenture
funding, the group said it was confident that it could grow at 1,200-1,400
beds per annum without going back to shareholders for at least another 18
months.
Sales doubled to Pounds 29.6m (Pounds 14.8m) and earnings per share
increased 40 per cent to 10.1p (7.2p).
A proposed final dividend of 1p makes a total of 1.5p compared with 1p.
Mr Keith Bradshaw, chairman, said the company took heart from both
Conservative and Labour party proposals on health care.
If the Conservatives were re-elected, the April 1993 introduction date for
the government's initiative to provide more care in the community is
expected to boost Takare's involvement with health authorities and health
boards.
Labour has a similar pledge for improving services in this area. Its policy
document, Better Community Care, states that Labour is committed to making
comprehensive community care 'an ideology-free zone'.
He said: 'The company's expansion over the past two years has been conducted
against a backdrop of uncertainty as to future public policy on funding
chronic care within the UK.
'But with the certainty that our formula represents a major plank in any
integrated programme to deal with today's demographic time bomb.'
The group may launch a new post-operation service in its nursing homes.
According to officials at the Department of Health as many as 40 per cent of
hospital beds are occupied by patients who are recovering from serious
operations but who have not yet reached the stage when convalescence can be
continued out of hospital.
COMMENT
Takare's distinctive formula of providing healthcare for the elderly and
chronically ill is unlikely to be threatened by a Labour government. Mr
Bradshaw points out that 80 per cent of its 4,500 beds are situated in
Labour-controlled areas which have been supportive of his company. Apart
from the inevitable confusion that results from a change of government,
there is no reason to believe that the political uncertainty could be a
significant problem for the group. It wisely took the view that 1992 was a
year to be long on cash and short on debt: borrowings were just Pounds 5m at
end-1991, representing gearing of 9 per cent (26 per cent). With forecast
profits of Pounds 11.8m, giving earnings of 12.1p, the shares are on a
prospective multiple of 15.5, which is not expensive given the group's
above-average earnings.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Weak demand leaves Calderburn down at
Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CALDERBURN, the office furniture manufacturer formed by the merger in July
1991 of Alan Cooper Holdings and Mayfield, reported a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 3m for the year to end-December.
The result was achieved on turnover of Pounds 28.8m, and compares with a
restated profit of Pounds 5.45m from turnover of Pounds 33.6m for the 1990
year.
The company blamed the profits downturn on the weak demand for office
furniture and seating in the domestic market.
The decline was exacerbated by exceptional costs which totalled Pounds
369,000 (Pounds 64,000) and represented the costs of redundancies and
merger-related reorganisation.
Mr James Blyth Currie, chairman, said the integration work following the
merger had gone better than predicted and it was likely that the enhanced
profitability resulting from the synergies and cost savings would exceed
original expectations.
Looking to the current year, he said orders had got off to a good start but
that the duration of the recession made it increasingly difficult to predict
any recovery.
Earnings per share came out at 8.9p (13.9p) and a final dividend of 4.9p is
recommended, making a total for the year of 7.7p.
The company had cash balances of Pounds 1.4m at the year-end and no
borrowings.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Persimmon falls 23% to Pounds 22.26m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSIMMON, the north of England-based UK housebuilder, yesterday revealed
that it had sold a record number of houses last month but warned that it was
too early to talk about a recovery in the UK housing market.
Announcing a 23 per cent drop to Pounds 22.26m in pre-tax profits for 1991,
Mr Duncan Davidson, chairman, said that the group had made an en- couraging
start to the current year.
Earnings per share fell from 23.4p to 16.8p. This still left a dividend
cover of almost two times leaving plenty of scope for Persimmon to keep its
promise to raise dividends by 20 per cent. This was made a year ago when the
group raised Pounds 33m from a 2-for-11 rights issue priced at 238p a share.
The final dividend was increased from 4.85p to 5.8p making a total of 8.6p
(7.15p). Persimmon's share price following yesterday's announcement rose
from 287p to 294p.
Mr Davidson said that the group had achieved a record 304 sales last month,
averaging more than 70 a month. The first week of this month had seen sales
slip to 50. This was still encouraging compared with very low sales at the
end of last year.
He said: 'We are not suggesting that this is the start of a recovery. There
have been previous occasions during the past year when sales have picked up
only to fall again. Nonetheless we would expect a recovery in house sales to
get underway during the next 12 months.'
The group which last year sold 2,324 homes intended to increase production
to 4,000 homes a year during the next few years. Purchases of sites during
the past 12 months had increased the group's land bank from 11,500 to 13,000
plots.
It said that margins should start to improve as higher-priced land bought
during the late 1980s was used up. Mr Davidson said that net pre-tax profit
per house had fallen from Pounds 16,000 in the first half of 1990 to Pounds
8,000 in the second half of last year. Net margins had fallen to 15.5 per
cent compared with 25 per cent several years ago.
He said said the quality of Persimmon's land bank had enabled the group to
stick to its policy of not writing down land values unless it had made a
loss on a site. This was then subtracted from operating profits.
The policy is in marked contrast to other housebuilders, some of which are
expected to announce very large land provisions during the next few weeks.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: SFO to probe European Leisure's Midsummer
bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SERIOUS Fraud Office confirmed yesterday that it was to investigate the
affairs of European Leisure, the entertainments group.
The investigation will centre on the circumstances surrounding the group's
Pounds 73m takeover of Midsummer Leisure in early 1990.
The takeover began as an agreed bid but became hostile after the Midsummer
Leisure board decided not to recommend the offer to its share holders.
Mr Michael Ward was chairman and chief executive of European Leisure at the
time of the contested takeover.
However he resigned in July last year after the company's share price
collapsed amid criticism from two former directors.
Mr Ian Rock, European Leisure's group managing director, said the company
would co-operate fully with the SFO in its investigation.
'This has come out of the blue, but does not alter the fundamentals of the
company,' he said.
European Leisure has total borrowings of more than Pounds 72m. Last week the
company announced it would not be paying a dividend on its preference
shares.
It is expected to announce later this month that operating profits for the
six months to December 31 have been wiped out by interest payments on its
debts.
The investigation follows enquiries into the company by the Department of
Trade and Industry which passed information on to the SFO last week.

XENOVA, a fast-growing UK biotechnology company, will announce today its
sixth significant collaborative deal with a large pharmaceutical or chemical
company.
The latest agreement - with Warner-Lambert of the US - is to develop drugs
to treat heart and brain diseases, based on chemicals discovered by Xenova.
The deal is worth several million dollars over five years.
Xenova, a privately held company, was established in 1987 in Slough, west
London. Its shareholders include 14 financial institutions in the UK, the US
and Japan.
The company specialises in discovering biologically active small molecules -
as opposed to the large protein molecules favoured by many other
biotechnology companies - by screening the chemicals produced naturally by
micro-organisms, particularly fungi.
Besides Warner Lambert, Xenova is collaborating with Genentech and Roche on
pharmaceuticals, with Monsanto on fungicides and with FMC in insecticides.
Its most important partner is Genentech, with which it signed a Pounds 12.5
agreement last September.
It is too soon for any Xenova drugs to have reached the market yet but Mr
Louis Nisbet, chief executive, says half a dozen promising candidates are in
development - for treating cancer, auto-immune and cardiovascular disease.
Xenova has raised Pounds 18m in capital funding and has an estimated value
of Pounds 35m. It is deciding now how to raise further funds for the
expensive business of product development. One option is a public flotation.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Rise to Pounds 3.7m at optimistic Cornwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cornwell Parker, the upmarket furniture and fabrics company, yesterday
announced a marginal increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.6m to Pounds
3.7m for the six months to end January.
Mr Martin Jourdan, chairman, said the results reflected cost controls and
stronger profits from the furniture division, which includes Parker Knoll.
Parker Knoll's furniture is targeted at the 45 year old and upwards market
and is relatively insulated from recession.
Mr Jourdan also reported the first signs of upturn and was hopeful about
consumer spending. 'We are seeing the end of the recession in our market,'
he said. Cornwell Parker's fabrics division reported lower profits due to
reduced sales. But sales of new ranges, launched since last Autumn, were
described as encouraging.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 44.1m (Pounds 46.1m). The company has eliminated
all borrowings and interest charges fell to Pounds 66,000 (Pounds 315,000).
This helped lift earnings to 6.2p (5.9p) and the company is increasing its
interim dividend 6.3 per cent to 1.7p.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Fairey profit little changed after good
electronics result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAIREY, the engineering group, turned in only slightly reduced profits due
to a strong performance from its electronics and electrical power division
and a five months contribution from LaserMike, the US measuring equipment
manufacturer.
Pre-tax profits for the year ended December 31 amounted to Pounds 14.5m
(Pounds 14.6m), reflecting lower interest income.
Sales were up at Pounds 88.8m (Pounds 86m).
Earnings per share rose from 27.6p to 28.1p, benefiting from a lower tax
charge.
The shares rose 22p to close at 385p.
The group ended the year with cash resources of Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 12.1m).
It is expecting to use its cash pile to buy another company as big or bigger
than last year's Dollars 11.5m (Pounds 6.5m) acquisition of LaserMike, the
US manufacturer of non-contact dimensional measuring equipment which is now
making a valuable contribution.
Mr Derek Kingsbury, chairman, confirmed that the group is likely to make a
purchase which would be incorporated into the rapidly expanding electronics
and electrical power division.
'We are looking for a good quality purchase. But we do not have to do a
deal,' he said.
Electronics and electrical power, which five years ago was the junior
partner to aerospace, now accounts for the bulk of the group's operating
profits. Boosted by the recent addition of LaserMike, it increased its
contribution to Pounds 7.56m (Pounds 7.15m).
Aerospace and defence also increased profits, to Pounds 2.45m (Pounds
2.26m), as Fairey Hydraulics increased earnings on reduced sales.
Filtration and specialised ceramics showed a profits decline to Pounds 3.17m
(Pounds 3.56m) mainly because fluid power orders from the mobile equipment
industry were down sharply
A final dividend of 6p (5.5p) makes a total of 9p compared to 8.25p in the
previous year.
COMMENT
If this is the worst year for Fairey, with static profits and a slight
increase in earnings, the future must look pretty good. The group has also
ended the year with a healthier cash balance than expected which will almost
certainly go towards making a biggish acquisition this year. Although
electronics and electrical power was helped by a significant contribution
from LaserMike in the US, it is still worth noting that over five years it
has transformed its modest profit contribution of just over Pounds 2m, which
was then significantly behind aerospace and defence, into Pounds 7.5m - more
than the other two divisions put together. With expected pre-tax profits of
Pounds 15.5m, giving earnings of 29.1p, the shares are on a prospective
multiple of 13.2. This is above the sector average of 12.2, reflecting the
group's ability to make good profits in difficult times.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Candover lifted to Pounds 3.9m despite
buy-out decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANDOVER INVESTMENTS, an investment trust specialising in management
buy-outs, increased both pre-tax profits and net assets per share in 1991
despite an overall decline in the level of activity in buy-out markets.
Candover yesterday reported a 7 per cent increase in pre tax profits to
Pounds 3.95m in 1991 while earnings per share rose by 24 per cent to 12.22p.
Net assets per share rose by 12.4 per cent to 244p. This was less than the
14.4 per cent rise in the FT Actuaries All Share Index over the same period
but the company said it was 'a fair result' given its conservative approach
to valuing unlisted investments. Over the past five years Candover has
outperformed the index by a wide margin.
It proposes paying a final dividend of 6p making a total of 9.5p for the
year, an increase of 12 per cent.
Candover invested in seven new companies in the UK and four overseas last
year. It also made six follow-on investments in companies already in its
portfolio.
It realised five of its investments for a substantial capital gain. It
floated two of its companies, Lowndes Lambert Group Holdings in the UK for a
total profit of Pounds 5.6m and ARI Network Services on NASDAQ in the US. It
also sold its investments in three other companies, Radyne, Allied
Filmmakers and Equity Leisure, to trade buyers.
Candover is presently establishing a 1991 Fund and expects to raise Pounds
35m for investment in medium-sized buyouts.
Large investments have included buy-outs of Blue Arrow Personnel Services
and the Midland Newspaper Group.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Enlarged Perkins Foods tops Pounds 24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERKINS FOODS, the acquisitive produce, frozen and chilled food group,
yesterday announced a 34.4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 24.3m
for 1991 and the purchase of Rowleys Frozen Foods for up to Pounds 5.9m.
Fully diluted earnings rose by a more modest 15.5 per cent to 11.9p.
After reporting a 47 per cent rise in half year profits to Pounds 10.5m,
growth slowed in the second half.
Mr Michael Davies, chairman, said that although economic conditions were
weak, demand for food remained strong and he looked for-ward to 'another
successful year'.
Mr Howard Phillips, chief executive, said that organic profits growth -
which he definded as excluding acquisitions made in 1991, though not those
in 1990 - had been 9 per cent. He said that Perkins was no longer an
acquisition-led company, and even without takeovers earnings growth would be
above average.
Group sales were 32.7 per cent higher at Pounds 260.1m. Interest receivable
was Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 2.9m) but Mr Ian Blackburn, finance director, said
there would be an interest charge in the current year as the group moved
into a net debt position. The tax rate fell to 30.5 per cent (32.2 per cent)
but Mr Blackburn said this would rise again in the current year.
The fresh produce division increased sales by 17 per cent to Pounds 114.9m,
but operating profits grew by 7 per cent to Pounds 7.6m. Mr Phillips said
that earn-outs on acquisitions in the division had ended in 1990 and been
replaced by bonuses for managers.
There was a sharp fall in profits from the mushroom division for the second
year running, to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1.6m) because of pricing pressure in
canned mushrooms. Profits from frozen foods rose 88 per cent to Pounds 10.7m
helped by acquisitions made at the end of 1990. Chilled foods profits were
also boosted by acquisitions, rising 71 per cent to Pounds 4m.
The purchase of Rowleys involves an initial payment of Pounds 600,000 of
which Pounds 200,000 is in cash and the rest in convertible DM preference
shares. Up to Pounds 5.3m more will be payable depending on future profits,
and this will be met through the issue of ordinary shares.
A final dividend of 2.6p makes a 4.3p (3.8p) total.
COMMENT
It is wise to be sceptical about companies such as Perkins, after the
experience of Albert Fisher and its likes. On the positive side, its
relatively short history has been a tale of good earnings growth with few
hiccups. Where things have gone wrong - such as with mushrooms - the
problems have been containable. However, the earn-out deals have left a
series of potential time bombs in terms of deferred consideration, involving
share issues and the DM convertibles. Some of the costs of acquisitions have
been neatly tucked away below the line in the preference dividends. There
are further troubles to come if every earn-out has to be replaced by bonuses
to keep the acquired management. Pre-tax profits this year might reach
Pounds 30m, but between a higher tax rate and more shares in issue, earnings
per share may only grow by about 11 per cent. A prospective p/e of 11 1/4 is
not generous to Perkins, but a premium rating has yet to be earned.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: BBA faces another gloomy year in its main
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBA, the maker of automotive components which yesterday reported 1991
profits down by a third to Pounds 49.4m has little to cheer about entering
another gloomy year in its biggest markets.
Admittedly the group has put its house in order - about 10 per cent of the
workforce has been cut, the interest charge is well down as a result of last
year's rights issue and the group should not face a repeat of significant
exceptional costs relating to restructuring.
This should lead to an increase in 1992 pre-tax profits of about Pounds 11m
even without an improvement in the main markets of UK, Australia, France,
Italy and Spain. At Pounds 60m of profits for the full year, and earnings
per share of 9p, BBA is on a fairly heady prospective earnings multiple of
over 14 times. But there is not much room for manoeuvre. The group is
confident that the German market, which improved last year, is holding up
this year year despite the country's growing economic problems. But any
reversal there would hit the group at a time when gearing at 42 per cent is
relatively high less than a year after a Pounds 79m rights issue.
The group is operationally geared for recovery when it arrives. But in the
automotive industry, in particular, its customers are going to be keen not
to let BBA recover margin it has had to forfeit during the recession.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Steetley spurns new offer from Redland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEETLEY yesterday recommended its shareholders to reject an improved offer
from rival building materials group Redland.
It said the marginal improvement in Redland's share offer had been eroded by
the fall in the company's share price on Friday. It added that a full cash
alternative proffered by Redland was only 2 per cent higher than the
previous partial cash alternative.
Redland's share price yesterday rebounded 11p to 458p, reflecting the
market's view that it will have achieved a good deal if it succeeds in
getting Steetley at this price.
Its offer of 87 Redland shares for every 100 of Steetley last night valued
the group at Pounds 640.3m or 398.5p a share. The company had previously bid
85 Redland shares for every 100 Steetley shares.
Steetley's share price yesterday rose 7p to 387p.
Mr David Donne, Steetley's chairman, said: 'Redland's illusory increased bid
is both inadequate and unacceptable. Steetley shareholders will benefit from
Steetley's recovery and future prospects by retaining their shares and
rejecting the bid.'
He said Redland was seeking to acquire Steetley when the company was at the
bottom of one of the worst downturns in the UK construction market. This was
despite Steetley having outperformed Redland in growth of profits, earnings
and dividend for 10 years.
Steetley said the offer price took no account of the potential earnings
growth when the UK, US and Spain, moved out of recession.
Mr Robert Napier, Redland's managing director said: 'Redland's increased and
final offer provides Steetley shareholders with significant increases in
capital and income as well as opportunity to share in a world class building
group with enhanced growth prospects. The combination of Redland and
Steetley has overwhelming commercial logic supported by annual savings of up
to Pounds 30m before tax, the full benefit of which will come through in
1993.'

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Barings 'pleased' to have kept profit flat
at Pounds 42.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARINGS, the owner of Baring Brothers, the City of London merchant bank,
made pre-tax profits of Pounds 42.5m in 1991, barely changed from the Pounds
42.4m it made in 1990.
'We are pleased with the result,' said Mr Peter Baring, chairman. 'The
operating environment was not universally friendly.'
Profits from two of the firm's core activities - advising companies and
trading in Far Eastern shares - were lower than in the previous year. But
this fall was offset by strong performances from its funds management
subsidiary and from the capital markets and treasury operations.
Mr Baring also pointed out that the company's losses from its loans and
leases were small, almost the same as in 1990. Provisions to cover the risk
of bad debts were 'in the low few millions (of pounds)'. Barings' loans -
together with leases, acceptances and securities held as banking assets -
total more than Pounds 1bn.
At the end of last year, Barings bought a 40 per cent interest in Dillon
Read, the US investment bank. Mr Baring said this deal was completed too
late in the year to have a material effect on the results.
The non-voting equity capital in Barings is held exclusively by the Baring
Foundation, a charity. Profits distribution to the foundation - in the form
of a dividend and a donation - increased from Pounds 4.9m in 1990 to Pounds
5.6m in 1991.

<TEXT>
Bankruptcy proceedings against Mr Asil Nadir, the former chairman of Polly
Peck International, have gone a step further with the appointment of
trustees to his estate.
The Official Receivers Office has appointed Mr Neil Cooper, a partner with
Robson Rhodes, the accountancy firm, to take control of his assets.
He will shortly take over the estate formally.
Den Norske Bank petitioned for proceedings against Mr Nadir last November in
respect of a loan for which he had stood guarantee of Pounds 1.5m.
Other creditors include the Inland Revenue and four securities houses which
have claims against Mr Nadir arising from his purchases of large amounts of
Polly Peck shares in the final weeks before the company went into
administration in October 1990.
Touche Ross, administrators to Polly Peck, have also served a Mareva
injunction on Mr Nadir claiming the repayment of Pounds 378m of funds
allegedly belonging to the company.
Mr Nadir's assets include some Mediterranean property on which there are
secured creditors, and his interests in a number of companies, which have
been not given a value.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Bartels to quit as chief of Foster's: Boardroom wrangles
continue at Australian brewer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOSTER'S Brewing Group, formerly Elders IXL, is expected to announce today
that Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive, has resigned following boardroom
wrangling over strategy.
He is expected to be replaced by Mr Ted Kunkel, chief executive of Molson
Breweries, the Canadian brewing group, which is half-owned by Foster's.
However, this was not confirmed.
Mr Bartels' departure comes four months after he survived a boardroom coup
by Mr John Elliott, Foster's former chairman and chief executive, now
non-executive deputy chairman. Mr Elliott tried to recover management
control of the company through his private company, International Brewing
Holdings, which owns 38 per cent of Foster's.
A public row was avoided by a compromise worked out between Mr Elliott and
Mr Nobby Clark, Foster's chairman, with the assistance of Asahi Breweries,
the Japanese company which owns 20 per cent of Foster's.
Rumours persisted that Mr Elliott was unhappy with the strategy being
pursued by Mr Bartels, who was appointed in a management shake-up which
followed Foster's record loss of ADollars 1.3bn (Pounds 573m) in 1989-90.
Mr Bartels, backed by Mr Clark, resisted pressure from Mr Elliott for sales
of non-brewing assets to help finance a return to dividend payments,
suspended in 1990 following a net loss of ADollars 43m. Mr Elliott sought a
capital return to shareholders as part of his efforts to repay debts of
ADollars 2.5bn acquired by IBH to finance its shareholding in Foster's. The
shares are worth about ADollars 1.65bn at last night's closing price of
ADollars 1.92 in Sydney.
Mr Bartels' resignation is believed to have been prompted by the board's
decision to pay an interim dividend for the six months to December, when the
group made a net profit of ADollars 77m. Mr Bartels argued for a further
delay in resuming dividend payments to strengthen the group's balance sheet.
However, the dividend was forced through after the two Asahi directors voted
with Mr Elliott.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Shares in MTM fall after new warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MTM, the specialist chemicals supplier, shed half its market capitalisation
at one stage yesterday after it made its second profits warning in a week.
Its shares, which began the day at 189p, fell to below 90p before closing at
119p.
Shareholders and analysts questioned why the Stock Exchange had not
suspended the shares before the announcement.
One analyst said the market in MTM shares had deteriorated into a 'casino'
after the announcement.
He had written a buy recommendation after Mr Richard Lines, chairman and
chief executive, told analysts last week at the offices of Robert Fleming,
MTM's merchant bank, that there were no problems with 1991 trading profits.
MTM's warning last Monday said profits would be substantially below City
expectations - then at Pounds 23m - because its auditors, Binder Hamlyn,
were taking a tougher view on the valuation of fixed assets. Before that
announcement, MTM's shares were at 286p.
With the company adding little to its statement that it was now facing a
'significant' shortfall in trading profits over expectations, some
shareholders were questioning whether Mr Lines could stay on as chairman and
chief executive.
Neither Mr Lines nor Mr Tom Baxter, MTM's finance director, who met analysts
last week after the company's first announcement, was available for comment.
One institutional investor bought shares last week after the first sharp
price fall when he was assured that 1991 trading was unaffected by the
difference of opinion with the auditors.
He said he could see no reason why Mr Lines should mislead the market about
profits and he had no idea why these profits suddenly appeared to have hit a
wall.
Mr Lines, who founded the company in 1979 after 11 years with ICI, owns 7
per cent of MTM.
Last week's announcement that MTM had fallen foul of the auditors,
particularly over capitalisation of development costs and some fixed assets,
took few in the City entirely by surprise.
But the group's admission that trading had fallen short of expectations
shocked analysts.
'Last week it was an accounting problem; this week it is a trading problem,'
one analyst said. Lex, Page 22

FT  10 MAR 92 / BBA blames 33% fall on lower sales volumes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBA, the component maker for the automotive, aviation and industrial
markets, yesterday blamed the worst post-war recession for a 33 per cent
fall in 1991 profits.
All products suffered in all the group's geographical trading divisions as
sales volumes and operating margins were hit.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 75.1m to Pounds 49.4m after exceptional
restructuring costs of Pounds 8.1m. Earnings per share fell from 15.74p,
fully diluted, to 7.22p but the group maintained its final dividend of 5.25p
although the total dividend for the year, unchanged at 7.5p, was uncovered
by earnings.
In the most important automotive parts division, sales fell by 4 per cent
but profits were 45 per cent down as the group was unable to pass cost
increases through to sales prices.
Mr John White, managing director, said the most damaging factor was the fall
in volume. However, he said that the market was not getting any worse this
year and German sales, which had risen last year, were holding up.
A fall in operating profits in the aviation division was cushioned by an
acquisition but the industrial division saw profits fall 22 per cent.
'In 1991 we took on the chin a lot that should not be repeated in 1992,'
said Mr Vanni Treves, chairman.
The fall in sales in automotive and then industrial products led to a number
of one-off costs which hit profits above the line.
Manufacturing inventories were reduced and the group shed 1,900 jobs which
helped lift exceptional costs to Pounds 8.1m.
In addition to the exceptional costs, BBA took a Pounds 17.7m extraordinary
charge, Pounds 10m of which was related to the cost of closing businesses.
The balance related to an adjustment to the fair value on prior years'
acquisitions.
The company said that if the draft accounting standard on the treatment of
extraordinary and exceptional items been in place the company would have had
to take some of these goodwill write-offs above the line.
Gearing fell from 61 per cent to 42 per cent following last May's Pounds 79m
rights issue and the interest charge fell as a result by Pounds 2m to Pounds
19.8m.
Mr White said there was no 'present indication' that things were getting
worse for the group. 'We have all owned up that this recession has been
longer and deeper than we had anticipated,' he said.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Italian bank in L1,525bn sell-off
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Italy's biggest banking
group, will be priced at L12,200 each, making next week's initial public
offering of 125m shares the country's largest-ever flotation, with a value
of L1,525bn (Pounds 709m).
Analysts said the price was slightly lower than expected and may have
reflected the recent weakness of Italian bank shares on the bourse.
Presenting the issue to domestic investors yesterday, Mr Gianni Zandano, San
Paolo's chairman, said that the flotation marked 'one of the most relevant
deals ever done by an Italian company'.
He said restated net profits for San Paolo's banking operations, the only
part of the group being floated, amounted to L553bn last year, marking a 12
per cent return on equity. Net earnings are expected to rise this year.
The San Paolo group, which has 782 branches in Italy including subsidiaries,
has 6.5 per cent of the domestic market for deposits and 7.8 per cent for
loans.
The flotation of around 20 per cent of San Paolo, is the most significant
step since reforms of the Italian banking system were approved in mid-1990.
The reforms allowed public sector banks to issue up to 49 per cent of shares
in their banking operations on the stock exchange.
Banco di Napoli was the first institution to take advantage of the new rules
but the San Paolo deal dwarfs the L400bn raised by the Naples bank for the
flotation of 20 per cent of its stock last November.
San Paolo will use the funds for acquisitions and growth. Last year it spent
L2,100bn to gain control of Crediop, the Rome-based, long-term lending
institution, and it has made a string of smaller purchases abroad.
The bank has given no indication of the stakes to be taken by Hambros, the
UK merchant bank in which it is a leading shareholder, or Salomon Brothers,
the US investment banking group, in which it also has an interest.
San Paolo has a reciprocal shareholding arrangement with both companies, but
the accord has been one-sided pending its own flotation.

FT  10 MAR 92 / BSkyB claims trading profit for first time: The sharp
turnround at the satellite television company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH SKY Broadcasting, the six-channel satellite television company,
yesterday celebrated a symbolic turning point - its first modest trading
profit ahead of schedule.
In March, the satellite company said it would have weekly film subscription
revenues of Pounds 3.8m plus Pounds 1m from advertising and other sources.
Programme costs and overheads would total Pounds 4.7m a week leaving a
weekly operating profit of Pounds 100,000.
This is in stark contrast with 16 months ago when British Satellite
Broadcasting and Sky Television merged. Total weekly income then was Pounds
1.6m and with total costs of Pounds 11.6m this left a weekly operating loss
of Pounds 10m.
'In my view both would have failed if there had not been a merger,' Mr Frank
Barlow, chairman of BSkyB and managing director of Pearson, owners of the
Financial Times, said yesterday.
The main shareholders - Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International, Granada, the
television and leisure group, Pearson, and Chargeurs, the French transport
and communications company - will be very relieved that the flow of money
out of the company has halted and the first trickle of money is flowing in
the other direction.
However, yesterday's presentation does not mean that one of the world's most
expensive television ventures is home and dry.
The company has guaranteed bank facilities of Pounds 420m and Pounds 860m in
loan stock. When the Pounds 240m equity money is included, a financial
structure of Pounds 1.52bn has been created to carry the system to operating
break even point. Interest charges paid to the shareholders on the debt are
running at Pounds 2.8m a week.
No-one at the company, which operates as Sky Television, would predict when
the venture might reach overall profit. Film deals have been agreed for
10-year periods with the seven leading Hollywood studios. It was claimed
that this extension of the original deal would save Dollars 100m (Pounds
58m) in payments between 1995 and 2000.
The financial future of BSkyB depends on two rising trends - the number of
homes receiving satellite television in the UK and a rising proportion
within that group paying Pounds 16.99 a month to receive both Sky
subscription channels.
By the end of January, 2.87m homes in the UK had satellite television via
dishes and cable television.
In the last week of February, 26,200 dishes were sold or rented because of
the exclusive World Cup cricket coverage.
The total represents 13 per cent of UK television homes. Mr Gary Davey,
deputy managing director, said because of the 'young, middle-market family'
nature of satellite homes, Sky accounted for 17 per cent of the population,
21 per cent of 16-34 year-olds and 23 per cent of 4-15 year-olds.
The trends on subscription revenues seem to be going Sky's way. Last July,
there was a total of 987,000 film subscribers but only 51 per cent took both
film channels. By the end of the year, when the total number of subscribers
had grown to 1.15m, the percentage taking the more expensive package had
grown to 70 per cent.
In January, 42,000 dishes were sold in retail outlets and 32,000 agreed to
pay for at least one film channel. Of that number, 28,600 or 90 per cent
took the second film channel.
Two large questions have to be answered before BSkyB can celebrate. The
first is whether, as some forecasts suggest, 50 per cent of UK homes will
have satellite television by 2001 and how high the programme costs will be.
The second, which applies mainly to Mr Murdoch, is what happens if a Labour
government is elected. Labour is committed to investigating cross-media
ownership.
Mr Robin Corbett, Labour's broadcasting spokesman, said Mr Murdoch would be
given the choice of taking his 50 per cent holding in BSkyB down to 20 per
cent or giving up his control of News International.

FT  10 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: San Paolo di Torino
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino seems to have involved so many
advisers in its L1.525 trillion equity offering that objective views in the
market are few and far between. That is a pity because the price of L12,200
a share looks dear, even though it is at the low end of previous
indications.
There is no doubting the quality of the bank or its ability to exploit
liberalisation of Italy's antiquated financial system, but Italian bank
earnings are likely to be hit by economic downturn this year. Even on an
optimistic assessment of 1992 prospects, the shares are being offered for a
forward multiple in excess of 11. That compares with a ratio close to 8 for
Credito Italiano and Banca Commerciale Italiana.
The low multiple of the latter two partly reflects weakness of their share
prices as investors made room for the San Paolo offering. Doubtless
institutions buying to build up a weighting in the stock will console
themselves with the thought that the offer price is also close to net asset
value after the revaluation of property and other assets allowed under the
Amato law on bank reform.
Mediobanca is expected to stabilise the market in the wake of the flotation,
but it will be a while before the bank lives up to the demands of the offer
multiple. In the meantime, the yield on Italian government bonds is some 8
percentage points higher.

FT  10 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: MTM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent behaviour of MTM and its advisers is a little disturbing. When
the specialist chemicals company made a profits warning last week, its
efforts to blame an accounting quirk rather than the recession helped limit
the markdown in its shares to a mere fifth of their value. Yesterday MTM
offered the more damaging opinion that, after all, there might be a
significant fall in trading profits separate from any accounting matters.
The market's reaction - the shares ended 42 per cent lower - was
understandably severe.
While last week's promise of a 10 per cent dividend increase must already be
in danger, the most pressing issue is why the trading position was revealed
so belatedly. It is scarcely conceivable that MTM's senior managers were
unaware of difficulties, even if a serious problem only emerged during the
fourth quarter. The position of Robert Fleming, MTM's main adviser, is
equally awkward: if it did not know, then arguably it should have.
Investors are left with the hope that there has been nothing worse than a
lack of disclosure for which MTM has now paid a heavy price. They might also
reflect that they were warned. When MTM was floated in 1986, sceptics noted
that it was difficult to identify where stated profits came from. That
reservation was subsequently overshadowed by a sextupling of its market
capitalisation to Pounds 250m, masterminded by the go-ahead and acquisitive
management of Mr Richard Lines. Whether he can now continue to combine the
offices of chairman and chief executive is an open question.

FT  10 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Persimmon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a striking sign of the times that Persimmon's Pounds 270m market
capitalisation is roughly equivalent to those of Costain and Barratt
Development combined. The once mighty have fallen, of course. But investors
have chased Persimmon shares to the point where they now yield a fifth less
than the market average. Has the enthusiasm been overdone?
Admittedly, there was little to disappoint followers in yesterday's news
that pre-tax profits dipped 23 per cent in 1991. Falling house prices
naturally hit margins, but the underlying position remains enviably strong.
Persimmon has bought 5,000 housing plots over the last 12 months, which
leaves it with a supply of land sufficient for four and a half years. More
to the point, the land bank looks cheap by industry standards - land costs
as a proportion of the average selling price last year are estimated at
between 20 and 25 per cent. Balance sheet gearing of 8 per cent provides
further flexibility to pursue the strategy of a volume player, though that
figure is somewhat flattered by sizeable land creditors.
One could easily be alarmed by acquisitive noises in yesterday's statement,
given Persimmon's sensible and level-headed emphasis to date on organic
growth. But perhaps such a reflex was inevitable after Raine's takeover of
Walter Lawrence, and will quickly pass. The more worrying issue for the
shares is just how fast earnings can resume their upward path, given the
prospects of low asset price inflation in the 1990s. Persimmon's volume
trend is capable of putting the company into, say, the Beazer league in the
foreseeable future, but investors would be wise not to exaggerate the
potential margin uplift.

FT  10 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Blunting Lamont's cutting edge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,550.7 (+17.6)
In theory, yesterday's consumer credit data and today's expected good news
on producer prices should be ample excuse for an interest rate cut to
accompany today's Budget. In practice, the chance appears remote despite
signs of restiveness elsewhere in Europe. The Belgian central bank hinted
yesterday that both it and the Netherlands are contemplating cutting rates
below those of Germany.
The latter in particular could justify such a move on the strength of both
its fiscal and its inflation record. The Belgian and Dutch currencies are
both stronger than the D-Mark within ERM, though neither country is likely
to rush in with dramatic cuts. For the UK to join the experiment, moreover,
would require France to move as well. The Franc is weaker than the D-Mark
and it is still smarting after trying unsuccessfully to beat German rates
last autumn.
Assuming the election is to be on April 9, timing is also of the essence. In
1974 the old minimum lending rate (mlr) was cut after the election was
called, but then it was set in response to an automatic formula and base
rates did not follow. In 1979, mlr was cut to deter currency inflows, but
parliament had not actually been dissolved. There is no reason to believe
that the convention of leaving interest rates alone during the campaign has
died with membership of the ERM - at least not where cuts are concerned. The
same might not be true of an increase to defend the exchange rate if the
market really took fright at the polls.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Letter: Mortgage interest tax relief and the imbalance in
Britain's cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ADRIAN JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader ('Future of tax reform', March 4) repeats the conventional
wisdom that the deductibility of mortgage interest on domestic properties is
undesirable, because it distorts the tax system in favour of purchasing
residential property, and against other forms of investment.
Abolishing mortgage interest relief would, however, distort the British
property market even more than at present, because business premises would
be unfairly favoured over domestic accommodation.
Businesses typically rent property for themselves. The rent paid is a tax
deduction, which attracts relief often at 35 or 40 per cent. The landlord
frequently is a pension fund, which pays no tax on rent receipts. The real
after-tax cost of land use to businesses is thus less than for homeowners,
whose tax relief is limited to 25 per cent of Pounds 30,000, and much less
than for those who rent their homes, who receive no tax relief at all.
Not surprisingly, the result is that businesses are able to pay more for
their premises than householders. The consequence of this imbalance can be
seen from the way vast swathes of British cities have become bereft of
residential accommodation. It is only by non-market means (eg the planning
system or housing associations) that areas like Covent Garden in London
retain any residents at all.
Only by increasing tax relief to householders will a level playing field be
created between business and domestic use of land.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Mr Major's error
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget 'Welsh windbag'. The way things look this morning, we may be about a
month away from calling Mr Neil Kinnock the new Welsh Wizard. He is already
credited with wizardry because he has converted what only three or four
years ago was a ragbag of far leftists, unilateralists, xenophobes, and
economic illiterates into a Labour party that looks electable. Of course, in
that endeavour he had the assistance of Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Her triumphs
frightened Mr Kinnock and his party; they were obliged to change. No matter.
The effect is the same. The Labour leader scents victory. As is the way of
British politics, many of Mr Kinnock's present detractors will fawn upon him
if he becomes prime minister.
That this might come to pass as the result of a hung parliament is one
reason why I am beginning to imagine that he may be using magic potions, or
casting spells. He must be jinxing his principal opponent. It is difficult
to think of any other explanation for Mr John Major's unfortunate timing of
the election. Win, lose or draw, there has to be a question mark over either
his ruthlessness or his strategic judgment.
Think about it. He might have gone to the polls immediately after his
selection by his party's MPs in November 1990, and won, or he might have
coldly asked for a verdict while at a peak of popularity at the end of the
Gulf war, and won, or he might have tried summer last year, or February this
year, and stood a better chance of winning than he appears to do today. (I
thought he would lose if he went last November. Some of his close colleagues
disagree.)
This is too bad. An incumbent prime minister is theoretically in possession
of an advantage over the opposition. He or she can decide the date of an
election. President Bush must envy this British device. He would have romped
home last spring. But he could not have conducted his campaign for
re-election immediately after the Gulf war even if he had wanted to. The US
constitution does not allow such merciless opportunism. As a result, Mr
Ronald Reagan's heir looks surprisingly vulnerable.
On this side of the water, Mr Major had a rare opportunity to overcome the
disadvantages of being heir to 12 years of Mrs Margaret Thatcher. He failed
to grasp it. The war could have seen him returned with a comfortable working
majority. Now the Conservatives may have to fight hard even to become the
largest party in a hung parliament.
The prime minister had the best of motives. He did not go in December 1990
because the poll tax was still in place, people did not know him, and the
war was imminent. He stayed his hand in the early spring of 1991 because,
understandably, it seemed improper to exploit the war - and, anyway, the
wounds caused to his party by the departure of Mrs Thatcher were not yet
healed. He declined to call an election later in the year because he had
pledged himself to see the Maastricht negotiations on
the future of the European Community through to a successful conclusion,
which he did.
That said, he made one supreme, and possibly fatal, strategic mistake. He
believed the forecasts of his own Treasury. Along with many others he took
the view that the end of the recession would have started by now, that
people would feel the beneficial effects of the upturn, and that in
consequence he could safely wait until this April or May before naming the
date. I was myself susceptible to this rosy conventional wisdom at various
times last year, but a prime minister, particularly one who has served in
the Treasury, is supposed to know better.
Mr Major did not. He is therefore on the brink of calling an election at a
time when the slight advantage in the latest few opinion polls is Labour's.
Governments usually lose or just hold on to support between the date of the
announcement of the election and voting day. In 1983, the Conservatives
gained a point, if you assume that they started with an average of the six
polls taken immediately before the campaign began. In 1987, they lost a
couple of points to the alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats. If that
precedent holds true this time, the Conservative overall majority will
vanish, and we will have an interesting parliament.
There is no rule that would prevent Mr Major from postponing the contest
until the end of June or the first week in July. The difficulty is that he
is circumscribed by public expectations. He would be derided as scared if he
gave a later date now. Here again, it is he who has boxed himself in. There
are plenty of telling examples of previous prime ministerial tribulations
(Callaghan in 1978-79 for one) which should have warned him not to get into
such a pickle. But he is in it now.
The Tories' last hope is that they will be rescued by this afternoon's
Budget. They may be, but if not, Mr Major's choice of spokesman is likely to
be questioned. I have deliberately used the word 'spokesman' and not
'chancellor' because it is as the purveyor of a party political broadcast
that Mr Norman Lamont will be judged this afternoon.
What he has to offer us in the way of tax cuts and talk of an end to the
recession will be the principal selling point of the Tory case for
re-election. For all I know, Mr Lamont may have produced the wisest set of
public accounts of the present century, but it is how he presents them that
will matter. On this aspect of the occasion, you will appreciate my doubts
by imagining, say, Mr Nigel Lawson delivering the same speech.
It may seem right to report back in different vein tomorrow. We may see a
brilliant, nay, miracle, Budget this afternoon. Mr Lamont may show faint
stirrings of unprecedented oratorical ability. We can then expect a stunning
campaign, and the rescue of the Tories. Just do not ask me to believe any of
that this morning.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Letter: 'Management fads' show high rate of failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM GRAVELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The debate in your letters column stimulated by Christopher Lorenz's
article on systems thinking and the learning organisation ('Bending minds to
a new learning circle', Management, February 17), is in danger of becoming a
chronicle of current 'flavour of the month' management concepts.
The problem with all new management concepts is their alarmingly high
failure rate. Mr Lorenz's article touched on the the reason for this:
'companies will rush to adopt (management fads) in a half-baked way'.
Simon Greenly (Letters, March 2,) refers to a survey - produced by AT
Kearney and reported by Paul Taylor ('Such an elusive quality', February 14)
which provides facts on why 80 per cent of total quality programmes fail. It
is because management fails to set challenging but achievable goals or
target tangible benefits.
In our experience, this failure is common to many improvement programmes,
not just total quality.
Most companies focus on applying the technique, not on the benefits it
provides. Successful companies focus on the benefits of using the technique
as the tool in their armoury for change.
The evidence shows you don't need to be a learning or total quality or any
other kind of organisation to improve - jump on a bandwagon and you may get
taken for a ride.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Letter: Contradiction seen in UK trade policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL A SAMUELS.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Observers of trade policy, the Uruguay Round negotiations at the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and 'EC-92' might be baffled at the
contradiction between the UK's traditional preference for liberal trade
policies and its policy and actions on bananas.
It is easy to understand the historical roots at the pressure for
protection. Those roots are largely driven by post-colonial concern,
especially for the Windward Islands and Jamaica, which have been allowed to
base much of their economies on a false security that has depended on
protection and by the political influence and wealth of a few importers who
have reaped high profits through their monopoly positions.
Loud voices in the UK still cry out for a perpetuation of this privileged
access in the face of efforts in the Uruguay Round to end similar
preferences. What seems to be forgotten is that the current preferences are
the remnants of practices that are clearly illegal under the Gatt.
A 1973 Gatt Dispute Panel examined 'Dollar Quotas' maintained for several
products by the UK. As a result of the panel's preliminary report, the UK
agreed to eliminate the quotas under review. Specifically, quotas on rum,
various citrus fruits and products, and cigars were terminated within two to
four years.
Unfortunately, bananas, one of the commodities in the original complaint by
the United States, were eliminated from the complaint because the US did not
have an export interest in bananas.
There is no doubt, however, that the quotas on bananas were as Gatt-illegal
as those removed on the other products. That illegality remains in spite of
the EC's Lome Agreement commitments.
Had history not excluded bananas in 1973, the EC would have less of a
dilemma now and the UK would find itself in less of a contradictory
position.
It is to be hoped that UK policymakers and their EC colleagues will not seek
Gatt-illegal solutions to their banana dilemma.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Letter: Names place their hopes on Walker inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir DAVID BERRIMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In response to Val Powell's letter (March 7), the majority of our
members wish to see Lloyd's thriving in the future.
The excessive losses incurred in 1988 by a few of the syndicates writing
London Marine Excess of Loss (LMX) Risk, with themselves being inadequately
reinsured, are likely to be repeated in 1989. In addition, many of our
members were encouraged by their agents to allocate a disproportionate
amount of their underwriting to LMX syndicates.
Unless such Names can recover a significant sum from litigation, their
resources will be wiped out and they will be unable to trade their way out
of the situation. These Names are angry and disillusioned. It would be
surprising if they did not feel that Lloyd's had failed them, and they are
placing their hopes on the reports to come from Lloyd's Loss Review
Committee and from Sir David Walker's inquiry into the LMX market.
It is to be hoped that Lloyd's will put pressure on obtaining a quicker and
cheaper resolution to any litigation that may ensue than occurred in the
Outhwaite case.
Lloyd's should also consider new arrangements to protect Names, perhaps by
requiring all agents, member and managing, to subscribe to a central Errors
and Omissions policy with centrewrite which could overcome some of the
problems that the present arrangements have exposed.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Revamping pensions law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INADEQUACIES of trust law as a legal basis for the regulation of pension
funds have been thoroughly exposed by the Maxwell saga. So, too, have the
operations of the scanty checks and balances operated by the fund management
watchdog, IMRO, and the Maxwell pensions funds' professional advisers. It
follows that the House of Commons Social Security Committee's plea for a new
pensions act will be difficult to resist.
The chief regulatory problem concerning pension schemes relates to the
inherent conflict of interest between the employer, whose representatives
usually control the board of trustees, and the beneficiaries. Maxwell was an
extreme example of the abuse of that potential conflict. But as the Select
Committee rightly points out, the independence of pension fund assets from
the finances of the employer has always been a myth. And the existing trust
law framework has been far too heavily tilted against the interests of the
beneficiaries, in terms of security, access to information and the ability
to seek redress against incompetence or fraud.
The merit of a new pensions act, a proposal fiercely resisted until recently
by the dinosaurs of the pensions lobby, is that it would strengthen the
independence of fund trustees and clarify some of the ambiguities
surrounding the ownership and control of fund assets and surpluses. The
committee's recommendation for a watchdog based on a beefed-up Occupational
Pension Board also makes good sense. There are attractions, too, in the
report's proposal for a relatively quick inquiry process before establishing
the detailed contents of the legislation.
Profit centre
Yet the vested interests at stake in occupational pensions are such that
even the fall-out from the Maxwell saga will not guarantee an easy passage
for such legislation. The build-up of surpluses has encouraged employers to
regard pension funds as a profit centre. That might appear to fly in the
face of their fiduciary obligations as trustees, but in the real world it
means that employers will only reluctantly forfeit control of these funds.
The select committee's call to look into the case for a compensation scheme
will similarly be attacked on the ground of its likely cost.
On the more immediate issue of whether to compensate the Maxwell pensioners,
the committee remarks that Pontius Pilate would have blushed at the
spectacle of so many witnesses washing their hands of their
responsibilities. And it recommends that an incoming government after the
election should confront those banks which hold disputed share certificates
of the pension funds with a view to extracting compensation; also the
American and other investment banks who dealt on Mr Maxwell's behalf. The
government's role, according to the committee's chairman, Mr Frank Field,
would be to top up this contribution to ensure that pension rights are
reinstated.
Failed dismally
The government has sticks and carrots to deploy in its dealings with the
financial community. But even suitably reinforced moral suasion is unlikely
to work unless the government itself admits a large measure of
responsibility. Successive governments have encouraged the growth of private
sector pension funds through substantial tax reliefs. They have failed to
heed calls for an adequate regulatory framework. In the specific case of the
Maxwell funds, the government's 1986 Financial Services Act failed dismally,
since IMRO put no barrier in the path of Mr Maxwell's fund management
company, despite clear warning signs.
A government that has been prepared to compensate everyone from the
investors in Barlow Clowes to the frustrated passengers of British Rail is
in a weak position to argue with people who were mostly dragooned into the
Maxwell pension funds as a condition of employment. Paying compensation for
the Maxwell theft would raise issues about other victims of smaller frauds.
But there is a prima facie case for compensation from the government and the
bankers. They will both have to offer powerful arguments to escape the logic
of the pensioners' case.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Ms Nice Guy on City offensive: Mo Mowlam talks to Ian
Hargreaves about regulation, corporate governance and mergers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the terrace of the House of Commons it feels like the first day of
spring, and that season's first fly has made the fatal mistake of tiptoeing
across Ms Mo Mowlam's side of the table. 'We don't take hostages,' she says,
with one swat.
This action is not wholly consistent with her Ms Nice Guy image in the City
of London, where she has spent much of the last year 'eating for Labour' in
the party's City charm offensive. 'I can go to Brooks's in St James Street
and I know the guy that waits on table,' she says.
Ms Mowlam, 42, has indeed become a familiar and courted figure in the Square
Mile, although in 1989 she was a surprise choice for Labour's City and
corporate affairs portfolio.
An MP only since 1987 and sponsored by health service union Cohse, her
pedigree has plenty in it to alarm your average merchant banker: degree in
social anthropology, former college lecturer and administrator, member of
the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, research assistant to Mr Tony Benn,
constituency in the industrial north-east and no previous contact with City
affairs beyond buying car insurance. She says a spell working with Mr Alvin
Toffler, the American futurologist, burnished her social resilience.
'My starting point was that both sides had a view frozen in time of what the
other was about. We had changed, I'm not sure the City had.'
She also set about learning her brief in a detail that has amazed many. It
is not that she never gets things wrong; an impulsive thinker and high-speed
talker, she does. Her sparky style contrasts with the well-oiled gravity of
her boss, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow industry secretary, with whom it is
said she has a touchy relationship.
But she rattles off acronyms of City regulatory agencies as if they were the
names of pet dogs, scribbling in a notepad to remind her of further detailed
points later in the interview.
Politically, she is freshly minted late-1980s Kinnockite - 'a degree of
market forces with a degree of social responsibility' - and hungry for
power. She is 'sick of having people cry on my shoulder and not being able
to do anything'.
Asked to encapsulate what Labour would aim to achieve in City affairs in a
first five-year term of office, she makes two points. 'I want our industry
to be in a lead position in Europe.' Pointing to the German chancellor's
recent interventions on behalf of Finanzplatz Deutschland, she says: 'What
Kohl is doing in relation to banking, that's what we should be doing.' Mr
John Redwood, her opposite number in government, has not just failed to
level the playing field, 'he sends too many industries out without even a
goalie'.
Her second point concerns consumers of financial services, whom she says
have had a raw deal from the Financial Services Act. She thinks the act has
produced a top-heavy system of regulation which few can understand. There
should be at most two regulators - one for wholesale, one for retail
investment business. 'There is a strong case for simplification at the
retail end. But I'm happy to leave the wholesale end looser, if they behave
slightly more intelligently.'
On many topics, she pledges close attention to expert views and committees
of inquiry. She does not think Labour would bring in a financial services
act in its first year, 'but after that, there are changes that will need new
legislation'. The agenda for a legislative framework - disclosure of
information to investors, commissions, compensation arrangements, mechanisms
for consultation - is clearer than the proposed solutions.
She rejects the idea that Labour would favour a primarily statutory
framework of regulation rather than the essentially voluntary system now in
place, just as she declines to headline her approach as backing an American
Securities and Exchange Commission-type solution. 'What I want is a system
that works. To use this sort of shorthand doesn't help.'
She thinks the Securities and Investments Board may need recasting, perhaps
as the kind of 'autonomous' agency now multiplying in the British public
sector under the 'next steps' programme. 'That would give you freedom of pay
structures and freedom to appoint outside, but clear objectives and clear
accountability.' She adds, however, that others are advising 'something more
quangoish, like the Office of Fair Trading'. She is still listening.
Labour sounds equally undecided about reforming the City's defences against
fraud. She thinks the Serious Fraud Office 'has done a reasonable job, but
has had a resources problem'. The law on disqualifying directors should, she
says, be deployed more vigorously.
Labour's ideas on corporate governance have been thought through in more
detail, in the party's evidence to the Cadbury Committee. Ms Mowlam warns
that 'another well-meaning document which says this is good practice and it
would be a terribly good idea if you chaps adopted it, would be a waste of
paper'. Included in Labour's policy is a fiery line on executive pay awards.
'I just enjoy attacking Mick Newmarch, (the Prudential's chief executive),'
she says.
Ms Mowlam has also played a prominent role in the Lloyd's saga, defending
the interests of Names, which is perhaps curious given the likely political
sympathies of those involved. She justifies her actions mainly on the
grounds that insurance is a big industry in which Britain needs to be modern
and competitive. 'With deregulation, the club can no longer regulate itself.
We have a competitive problem on our hands and we have to react.'
On mergers and acquisitions policy, she struggles to make sense of Labour's
proposed introduction of a 'public interest' test for mergers. This would
involve not a change in the law, but a reversal of the so-called 'Tebbit
doctrine' specifying that only pure competition issues should be admitted in
takeover rulings.
Labour, she says, 'has a group of people looking at the detail'. But what
kinds of merger would she hope to stop? 'I'm not going to answer that.'
Hanson-ICI? 'Yes.' Why? Because of Hanson's 'track record on investment and
R&amp;D'. Does that mean companies like Hanson should never be allowed to take
over any well-run manufacturer? What about BTR's takeover of Hawker
Siddeley? 'We're not about stopping takeovers, sometimes they're needed to
improve efficiency,' she ripostes. 'But in the 1980s, we were the takeover
capital of Europe and that's not constructive.'
She then agrees that, unless Labour can clarify its position on public
interest in mergers, 'that would be as counterproductive as what we had in
the 1980s'. In Labour's approach to the City, one swatted fly does not make
a summer.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Pledge to promote and protect: The Labour party's policy
themes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's policies towards the City are heavier on issues that need to be
explored than specific pledges of action. At the general level, there are
two themes: promoting the City's competitive edge against rival European
financial centres; and protecting retail customers.
One wider policy theme - discouraging another UK merger wave, and using a
broader definition of the public interest in assessing takeover proposals -
would also affect the City. Such an approach would reduce the pickings
available for corporate financiers and City lawyers, and make it harder for
them to plan any individual bid.
Otherwise, says Ms Mo Mowlam, a Labour government would stand for:
Reformed regulation. 'Regulation is an albatross round our neck. At the
moment we have a regulatory system which doesn't work to the advantage of
protecting the consumer. It is not cost-effective, it is cumbersome and
bureaucratic.'
Ms Mowlam leaves her exact reforms unclear, but they are likely to involve
fewer regulators; a more explicit statutory framework for the regulators;
less chance of products falling between regulators and compensation schemes;
better co-ordination of fraud responsibility between Department of Trade and
Industry, Serious Fraud Office and the City regulators; and:
Tighter consumer protection. Reforms would start from what the Securities
and Investments Board retail review, due this week, comes up with, so no
detailed promises yet. But she says: 'I clearly have concerns about millions
of people who have had a very raw deal (from retail financial services) -
they have not had the consumer protection they ought to have had.' Likely
areas for attention include: more information (although she says 'I don't
think there are any very easy answers' on how to provide for disclosure of
commissions); an attempt to preserve and strengthen the independent
intermediaries sector; and an expectation that companies that take on tied
agents should be responsible for their actions.
Insurance reforms. Labour would give with one hand, fighting harder for the
insurance industry's cause in Brussels, and take with the other: life
insurance companies would be a prime target of the tighter regulation of
retail financial services. At times Ms Mowlam seems to be hankering after
German-style strict supervision of new insurance products.
Lloyd's would also be a potential target. Not only has its chairman, Mr
David Coleridge, got 'an attitude problem' in her view, but the whole
institution is a symptom of old-style City culture, still far too prevalent.
Most of the suggestions in the Rowland report are 'reasonable if a bit
minimal', but insiders may have been exploiting the market's outsiders:
'Some of the evidence I have seen makes it look as though churning and
dumping (of risks) has gone on.'
Accountancy. The tighter accounting standards that the Financial Reporting
Council is introducing need a counterpart in tighter supervision of
accountants, partly by laymen. Auditors might be asked to report publicly on
a company's internal controls, and should have a statutory duty to collect
information in a form useful to government statisticians. The Caparo
decision restricting auditors' liability should be re-examined, which would
lead to a tighter definition of auditors' responsibilities. Labour would be
prepared to consider either restricting accountancy firms from doing
consultancy for audit clients or insisting that companies rotate their
auditors - but only if a review of corporate governance suggests no better
way to ensure auditors' independence.
Corporate governance. Audit committees should be mandatory. Chief executives
should be separate from chairmen. Non-executive directors should be stronger
and more independent. There should be better annual reports, in line with
those of the best companies, and perhaps more detailed reports to the
regulators, as with the 10K reports required in the US. Companies should set
out their long-term strategies in their annual reports. Investment
institutions should vote more actively at AGMs, especially on directors'
pay. But there is no commitment to make any of this legally binding - the
only clear promise of statutory action is over reports to employees.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Fiddling while Russia burns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government must feel very lonely. Apart from the formidable
support of President Boris Yeltsin, it seems to have nothing but enemies at
home and lukewarm friends abroad. The unhappiness of the former is not
surprising. But the dilatory and complacent approach of the leading
industrial countries is less forgiveable. If they do not soon put up the
relatively small sums needed to secure reform, there may be no reform left
to secure.
The scale of the problems inherited at the end of last year convinced the
Russian government that it had to act swiftly. The die was cast when the
government introduced the first stage of price liberalisation in early
January. What is now unfolding in Russia, as a result of that decision, is
the first and, quite possibly, last attempt at market-oriented reform within
a democratic political context.
Nor has that effort yet failed. As Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister,
noted in the FT last week, prices rose by 250 per cent at once, but then
stabilised. Monetary policy has also been tightened - the Russian central
bank chairman, Mr Georgy Matiukhin, notwithstanding  - and the free market
value of the rouble has even strengthened a little.
The government has decided it must maintain momentum. Accordingly, the next
phase of price reform is to be introduced by the end of April, when almost
all prices will be freed. Energy prices alone are expected to rise six-fold.
Wage-price spiral
These price increases have to occur without leading to a wage-price spiral.
Preventing such a spiral requires stabilisation of the rouble above a level
so low that wages would be virtually worthless. Such an over-devaluation
would not only be socially destructive, but would be otiose from the point
of view of incentives to produce.
It is for this reason that the Russian government is looking for western
support of about Dollars 5bn for currency stabilisation. Also sought are
Dollars 6bn in humanitarian assistance and a similar sum for imports to keep
the factories running. Finally, the government seeks further relief on debt
service.
Unfortunately, Russia is unlikely to receive what it needs and, least of
all, to receive it in time. The group of seven leading industrial countries
has preferred to wait for the International Monetary Fund. But even if
everything were to go perfectly, membership of the countries of the
Commonwealth of Independent States would only be discussed by the IMF board
in mid-April. It would then take until late May, at the earliest, before
they could join the IMF and until late summer before the first lending
operation.
Likely delays
Even this timetable could prove too optimistic. The G7 is talking of a
combined CIS quota of 4.5 per cent of the total. But the Russian government
wants more than the 2 to 2.5 per cent that would be its likely share. Given
this disagreement, further delay is perfectly likely.
A far better course would be for the G7 to provide the funds itself, while
using the IMF as its executive arm. By imposing clear conditions in this
way, the donors should be able to assuage their understandable doubts about
the ability of the Russian government to carry the programme through. By
providing assistance, however, they would increase the government's
effectiveness, above all by supplying it with leverage over the recalcitrant
forces ranged against it.
Even with G7 support, Russia's reforms could fail; and even without it, they
might succeed. But assistance must make success more likely. Equally certain
are the benefits that would accrue to the world as a whole if Russia's
economy were to be reformed. When what is at stake is a mere Dollars 20bn or
so, about a twentieth of what the west spent to defend itself against the
Soviet Union in one year, the ratio of probable reward to certain cost is
overwhelmingly in favour of the former.
Throughout the Gorbachev era, the west complained that he did too little and
acted too late. If the west does not act decisively in the next few weeks,
it will be judged guilty of precisely the same mistake.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Arts: My Fair Lady - The Opera House, Manchester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This new production of My Fair Lady is well timed, has already been
extensively hyped and is likely now to visit London.
There has been some brouhaha over whether or when national press would be
invited to review these Manchester performances - and therefore over whether
Mancunians were being given merely a preview or rehearsal run. Frankly, a
lot more rehearsal and revision would have helped. There are at present just
three good reasons to catch it: Helen Hobson, the fresh new Eliza; the
elegant and original sets by David Fielding; and My Fair Lady itself.
The last is the most important. Most of the brilliant dialogue is straight
out of Shaw's Pygmalion, and yet the song lyrics prove just as memorable.
This is something rare in musicals, but rarer yet by far is the fact that
the songs are made buoyant less by Lerner's words than by Loewe's music.
(Even Higgins's Sprechgesang is, or should be, intensely musical.) But I
could not write this way if this production were my first experience of My
Fair Lady. The lyrics are under-inflected, some performers are under-voiced
and over-amplified, several parts are miscast, and neither Eliza nor Higgins
emerges as a star role.
Helen Hobson does everything well, has enough voice for it all and
exaggerates nothing. She has timing, feeling and fun. But she is as yet only
half the Eliza she could be, and for this and much else, Simon Callow, the
director, is to blame. She never, for example, learns to carry or turn her
head elegantly or expressively. (Several of the other, more experienced
actors do not even seem to know how to use their eyes.)
Edward Fox makes a nonsense of Higgins by blurring his consonants, drawling
his vowels (he calls them 'vahls'), and dawdling behind the music. He works
his six facial expressions for maximum contrast, but none of them conveys
intelligence. When he says 'I have my own spark of divine fire' ('fah'),
no-one believes him. He takes Eliza to a place which he calls 'Airscot' and
which Michael Medwin's atrocious Pickering calls 'Ashcot'. What kind of
phonetics do these two club bores know?
There are minor signs that Callow has tried to 'reconceive' this beloved
show, not very revealingly. Mrs Pearce (Jennie Goosens) has become Irish,
and Mrs Higgins (Sheila Burrell) is now a Bohemian artist. Jasper Conran,
the designer, has made the Embassy Ball a dingy, vulgar affair - horridly
choreographed by Quinny Sacks - in which Eliza's simple white neo-Grecian
gown is a breath of fresh air; the idea does not come off. Wittier is his
Ascot, with all the ladies dressed like stems and wearing huge flower hats;
Eliza, as an all-pink rose, really is the purest and loveliest here.
David Fielding's non-realist designs would not surprise an opera audience.
In a musical, they are a shock. The basic white set, with columns and walls
in classical English architectural style, is printed all over with words
from Shaw's ideal phonetic language (for example, 'laeqgwej'). He always
makes much of Shaw's dominant symbols: most wittily in the Covent Garden
scenes, where the old fruit and vegetable market stands right before the
distant and tilted Opera House. 'Laeqgwej' is what will take Eliza from the
former to the latter.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Arts: Some Jam Tomorrow/Once Upon a Song - Arts
Theatre/King's Head, Islington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of London's most amiable small theatres have just launched two new and
inept musicals. But the one at the Arts, Some Jam Tomorrow by Neil Innes,
has a bonhomie and an openheartedness that are not always resistible -
whereas at the King's Head the wall-to-wall cliches of Anthony Newley's Once
upon a Song are made leaden by their unvarying predictability and, seeping
up through that, by a certain whinging meanness.
Some Jam Tomorrow is actually by far the less ept. On purpose. The title
comes from Lewis Carroll's Alice books; and Neil Innes, who is his own main
performer, tries to combine Wonderland with Nowadays. Nothing about the show
is slick, and half the time we are being nudged to laugh at its crummy
daftness. Innes puts a red nose on to sing 'I'm an Urban Spaceman' or goes
all country-and-western to sing 'I've Got my Hand up the Skirt of Mother
Nature.' The more self-consciously silly, the duller.
When, however, Innes dislocates his jaw in a country cadenza, he shows real
comic talent. He switches styles easily. Talking, he sounds like Tony
Hancock; singing, he moves between the idioms of Country, Lennon-McCartney,
Elton John, French crooner ('croon-aire') and more. He is actually less
close to Alice than he is to pantomime. He brings a man up onstage to honk a
car-horn during a song, he throws sweets, he keeps changing costume and he
makes the audience join in.
Never have I known more audience participation. It was positively
therapeutic. At the ends of the lines of one song we cried 'Balls]',
'Zoomzoomzoom]' and 'Bong]' (if we were male) or 'Cuckoo]' (female). I
thought we had reached our climax when we all joined in blowing raspberries
as loudly as we could, but I was wrong. Later, after we had all sung along
in 'We are the Slaves of Freedom,' he called out 'Give me an S]' 'S]' we
yelled. 'Give me an O]' Then D. Then O, F and F. 'What does that spell?' he
urged. So we told him. And he took the point to heart and slunk offstage.
Once upon a Song is altogether more crafted, neat and stale. All-singing,
with no linking dialogue, it tells the story of Every Nuclear Family. The
Father (Newley himself) and The Mother (Diane Langton) have The Daughter
(Natalie Wright) and The Son (Kristopher Milnes the night I went; the role
is double-cast), but have the usual marital problems. Father leaves,
everyone mopes, Father comes back. Everything is generalised; nothing is
particular - save that the family keep presenting themselves as
song-and-dance show-people. When Newley sings 'I'm just a Middle-aged
Silent-majority On-the-dole Rock-n-roll Star,' he opens a vein of truth and
you blush for him.
There is not a fresh lyric or line in the show. Langton has a welcome vocal
power, and young Milnes has talent. Wright overdoes the starry-eyed fervour
that won her the title role in (remember?) Bernadette (goodness]). Newley
himself, a mannered and limited performer, likes to sing with slouched
posture, his shoulders lopsided and hunched and his eyes shut. His voice has
a tremolo so heavy that at times it is a slow trill covering the span of a
minor third. His hand gestures, though, are something else; they kept
reminding me of Dusty Springfield. He has a whole lexicon of them, and nary
a one is spontaneous.

It is Norman's big day and the question is: will he or won't he? Wear yet
another new sweater with a funny design, that is. Regular viewers of Film 92
are as likely to turn on for Barry Norman's woollies as to see which movies
he is reviewing. Today's films include the British-made 'Hear My Song' about
Irish tenor Josef Locke which is receiving a lot of attention in the US as
well as the UK (10.30 BBC1).
FT readers with nothing better to do may want to have a look, earlier in the
day, at what Norman Lamont is up to. The Chancellor should stand up in the
House at 3.30 but Budget 92 with David Dimbleby, safest hands in the
business, begins at 2.30 on BBC2. For those with no television but a
wireless, Radio 4 starts PM Budget Special, Valerie Singleton presenting, at
3.00. ITN wades in at 3.15 on ITV with a team headed by Alistair Stewart,
John Suchet and Julia Somerville.
Channel 4 presents 'a modern fairy tale play combining fact and fiction to
mark Adult Learners' Week': Homer And His Pigeons (8.00). That is followed
by the C4 arts programme Without Walls which today considers what 12 years
of Conservative government have done to culture (9.00).

FT  10 MAR 92 / Arts: From dreams to dead fish - The latest Saatchi
installation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Young British Artists is the title of the new display at the Saatchi
Collection (98a Boundary Road NW8, until August: Fridays and Saturdays from
12 until 6: 071 624 8299). At the more superficial level, this latest
selection demonstrates that Charles Saatchi's collection continues to grow
apace by the wholesale acquisition of the work that takes his eye. Rather
more to the point, it shows that his interest embraces not just the
international mainstream, as determined by the current orthodoxies of museum
curators and major dealers, but also the native and youthful avant-garde, as
determined by . . . etcetera etcetera.
Most interesting of all is the demonstration it makes within its own narrow
compass - only six artists are represented, two of whom work as partners -
of the critical dilemma with which we are now faced, in any consideration of
the latest, newest thing. On the one hand, here are two painters, that is to
say artists who lay paint onto canvas with their own hands in the usual way.
One is a minimalist and subliminal conceptualist, the other an exuberant and
old-fashioned surrealist. On the other hand, there are two sculptors, both
of whom appropriate their imagery from given material. And there in the
middle is the partnership, with its curious amalgam of the conceptual, the
sculptural and the polemical.
As ever, the installation of this farrago is magnificent, the whole initial
experience something of true theatre. Theatre indeed, and Grand Guignol at
that, for dominating the first and greater space are the installations of
Damien Hirst, he of the Serpentine fish-tanks, and the tropical butterfly
cycle of life and death in a vacant shop off Bond Street last summer.
Here again are his shelves of fresh fish in tanks of formaldehyde, his
cabinets of pills and drugs, and yet more shelves of visceral specimens in
bottles and jars. But a single tiger shark, suspended alone in its huge tank
centre stage, is the star turn. It is a beautiful if arresting creature, yet
its qualities are inherent to it. Would it be any the less commanding in its
fascination were it to be presented in the museum, or even an enterprising
shop window? The answer is no, for its frisson comes of presentation, not of
art.
Indeed its status as art is in question from the moment Hirst's pretensions
are betrayed by the title: 'The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind
of Someone Living'. The shock and horror of the physical, and the certainty
of death, have been staples of art through the ages, but always their
consideration has been mediated by the intervention of the work of art
itself, that both distils and transcends the reality. For Michelangelo to
have offered a cadaver as a Pieta, or Rembrandt the actual side of beef,
would have been both gratuitous and an evasion.
That has not changed, yet here we have the heresy persisted in, that mere
presention and nomination as art is enough - how the old ironist, Duchamp,
would smile. Nearby the shark, Hirst has a double glass chamber, in one part
of which sits a large box where the gentles thrive; and in the other the
flayed and bloody head of a cow, and above it an electric fly-killer where
the unwary bluebottles their quietus make with a sudden dive into the tray
below. 'A Thousand Years' is the metaphysical proposition: most unpleasant.
The other sculptor, Rachel Whiteread, seems by contrast positively
magisterial. Her more recent work, smartly simple casts of mattresses and
mortuary slabs, may have led her down the same dire path of dubious
metaphysics, but here, with the works by which she first attracted notice,
the evidence of an emerging and potential talent is unmistakeable. Already
the image is the cast itself, but the material is still the working plaster,
practical and unprepossessing. 'Ghost', the off-white block that proposes
the full space of the room within by casts of the four walls without, is
especially impressive, the sense of an intuitive and developing engagement
with both material and idea.
But the work of the painter, John Greenwood, offers the greater contrast.
Here is an artist who does not receive his imagery, even to the extent that
Miss Whiteread does, from given and existing material, but dreams it up
himself and establishes it within a credible space and context by putting
brush to canvas. That this should seem even worth the comment shows how far
we have come in our expectation of what art is, or might be, at least in the
context of the Saatchi collection.
Greenwood's bizarre and frantic structures exist consistent both within
themselves and the pictorial space they occupy. They clearly derive from the
surrealism of Picasso around 1930, and of Dali and Miro to some extent, but
most of all from that of Yves Tanguy, ambiguously erotic amorphous forms set
in an oddly hermetic, perhaps submarine world. Greenwood's paintings are
somewhat larger and, perhaps, prematurely sophisticated, full of cleverly
wrought jokes and pictorial mischief. Were they to be less self-regarding in
their humour, and, well-done as they are, less technically complacent, they
would be the more impressive. As an artist, Greenwood might live a little
more dangerously.
Alex Landrum, with his minimal diptychs, each panel painted in household
vinyl or emulsion and subcutaneously labelled by the trade name of the
single colour it carries; and Ben Langlands and Nikki Bell, with
architectural models of the ground plans of public institutions, shown in
relief, complete the show.
Nicely apropos, the Tate, has just announced that it has accepted a gift by
Charles Saatchi of nine paintings and sculptures by British artists of the
1980s: Deacon, Denis, Milroy, Murphy, Opie, Ryan, Wentworth and Willing.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Arts: The Pilgrim's Progress - RNCM, Manchester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The theme of personal discovery has led composers to some of their most
challenging statements. From Die Zauberflote to Parsifal and beyond there
are operas which have strained to break the accepted notions of what
constitutes a stage work so that they can express all that they want to say
about man and his spiritual journey through life.
It would seem that Vaughan Williams felt that kind of deep commitment to The
Pilgrim's Progress. The score only reached its final form after a lengthy
creative period in which it was assembled in various stages, at one point
being raided to supply material for the Fifth Symphony. The 1951 Covent
Garden premiere was not a success and in its wake the opera was largely
written off as not theatrical enough, more 'a sort of oratorio'.
Performances of the score since then have been few and far between, staged
productions non-existent. In reviving pieces of this kind the national music
colleges have hit upon some well-chosen ventures in recent years, but it is
unlikely that anybody could have foreseen the truly remarkable success
scored by the Royal Northern College of Music with its production of The
Pilgrim's Progress last Thursday.
As one watched the drama unfold, the main arguments against the opera seemed
to fall away. How could it be thought long-winded, when the scenes are so
concise? Or lacking in theatrical variety, when Vaughan Williams so clearly
contrasts passages of private communing with vivid crowd scenes, like the
Valley of Humiliation and Vanity Fair, peopled by creatures of the
underworld, human and otherwise (even if the music in both is admittedly
rather weak).
If there is an un-operatic element, it is probably the central character,
for this is the story of Everyman, not a princely Tamino or a naive
Parsifal. It takes a while for any personal sense of involvement with the
Pilgrim to catch the heart, but it does with his prison soliloquy in the
second half, and there the baritone Richard Whitehouse rose splendidly to
the occasion, fresh of voice, full of visionary fervour.
There are no other individual roles that can make a decisive impact,
although John Neale was a resonant Evangelist and Darron Moore firm and true
as Watchful. (His Nocturne is a particularly effective passage, made from
musical shadows and nagging night-time doubts.) It is the company spirit
that makes or breaks a performance and the RNCM had fielded a well-rehearsed
cast in a first-rate production by Joseph Ward, designed by Michael Holt,
and for the most part notably well played by the student orchestra under
Igor Kennaway.
In the final scenes one felt powerfully that sense of communal beneficence
which is so much the strength and inspiration of Vaughan Williams's music.
Now that we are ready to accept other unusual religious or mystic works such
as Messiaen's Saint Francois or Birtwistle's Gawain on their own terms, it
is perhaps timely to reconsider The Pilgrim's Progress. With this inspired
production the reputations of the RNCM and of the opera itself have been
equally enhanced.

FT  10 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: Undervalue order is extra-territorial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWDRILL AND ANOTHER v HAMBROS BANK (JERSEY) LTD Court of Appeal (Sir Donald
Nicholls, Vice-Chancellor, Lord Justice Taylor and Lord Justice
Farquharson): February 27 1992
THE COURT has an extra-territorial power to order a foreign defendant to
restore sums paid to him by an insolvent company at undervalue, but it is a
discretion to be exercised only if he was sufficiently connected with the UK
for it to be just and proper to make an order against him.
The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by the plaintiff
administrators of Paramount Airways Ltd from Mr Justice Mervyn Davies's
decision setting aside leave to serve proceedings on the defendant, Hambros
Bank (Jersey) Ltd out of the jurisdiction.
Section 238 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides: '(2) Where the company has
at a relevant time . . . entered into a transaction with any person at an
undervalue, the (administrator or liquidator) may apply to the court for an
order under this section (3) . . . the court shall, on such an application,
make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would
have been if the company had not entered into that transaction.'
SIR DONALD NICHOLLS V-C said that Paramount carried on business as a charter
airline. On August 7 1989 an administration order was made in respect of the
company.
In the present proceedings the joint administrators were alleging that in
July 1989 the company had sums of Pounds 1.3m and Pounds 346,800 in England,
which were transferred to an account held by a Jersey company with Hambros
Bank (Jersey).
The administrators alleged that the company's money was misappropriated and
paid away for no benefit to the company.
They asserted that the payments were transactions at an undervalue, made
when the company was unable to pay its debts. They sought an order under
section 238 of the Insolvency Act 1986 for the bank to restore the money to
the company.
The administrators obtained leave to serve proceedings out of the
jurisdiction.
The bank applied to set aside leave. Mr Justice Mervyn Davies acceded to the
application.
He held there was an implied limitation to 'any person' in section 238,
restricting it to British subjects, companies registered in England,
foreigners present in England and, possibly, foreign companies carrying on
business in England.
The administrators appealed.
When using the expression 'any person', parliament was to be taken to have
been legislating only for British subjects or foreigners coming to the UK,
unless the contrary was expressed (which it was not) or was plainly implicit
(see Blain (1879) 12 ChD 522,526 and Clark v Oceanic Contractors (1983) 2 AC
130).
Section 238 applied in the case of a company in respect of which an
administration order had been made or which had gone into liquidation.
Subsections (2) and (3) provided that where a company had entered into a
transaction 'with any person' at an undervalue, the court 'shall' make 'such
order as it thinks fit' restoring the position to what it would have been
had there been no transaction.
An order was not to be made under the section if the company entered into
the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its
business, and at the time there were reasonable grounds for believing it
would benefit the company (subsection (5)).
Section 239 was concerned with giving a preference 'to any person'. It
applied in the same circumstances as section 238. Giving a 'preference'
meant doing anything which put one of the company's creditors, or a
guarantor, into a better position in the event of its going into liquidation
than otherwise would have been the case (subsection (4)).
The two sections were matched by comparable provisions in sections 339 and
342, regarding individuals who were adjudged bankrupt.
On its face the legislation was of unlimited territorial scope.
Parliament might have intended that the English court could and should bring
before it, and make orders against, a person who had no connection whatever
with England save that he entered into a transaction, maybe abroad and in
respect of foreign property, with a person who was subject to the insolvency
jurisdiction of the English court.
Such an intention was possible. But in some instances such a jurisdiction or
its exercise would be truly extraordinary.
The difficulty lay in finding an acceptable implied limitation.
The case for some limitation was powerful, but there was no single simple
formula which was compelling.
Authority did not provide any guidance.
The solution did not lie in retreating to a rigid and indefensible line.
Trade took place increasingly on an international basis. To meet changing
conditions English courts were more prepared than formerly to grant
injunctions in suitable cases against non-residents or foreign nationals in
respect of overseas activities.
When considering 'any person' in the sections, it was impossible to identify
any particular limitation which could be said with any degree of confidence
to represent the presumed intention of parliament.
What could be seen was that parliament could not have intended an implied
intention. The expression must be left to bear its literal and natural
meaning.
That conclusion was not as unsatisfactory as it might appear at first sight.
There were two safeguards built into the statutory scheme.
The first lay in the court's discretion as to the order it would make.
Despite the 'shall' in the section, the phrase 'such order as it thinks fit'
was apt to confer an overall discretion, which was wide enough if justice so
required, to make no order against the defendant.
If a foreign element was involved the court would need to be satisfied that
the defendant was sufficiently connected with England for it to be just and
proper to make the order against him.
In considering whether there was sufficient connection, the court would look
at all the circumstances, including the defendant's residence and place of
business, his connection with the insolvent, the nature and purpose of the
transaction, the nature and locality of the property, the circumstances in
which he became involved in the transaction or received a benefit from it or
acquired the property, whether he acted in good faith, and whether under
foreign law he acquired an unimpeachable title free from claims.
The importance attached to those factors would vary from case to case.
By taking into account and weighing those and any other relevant
circumstances, the court would ensure that it did not exercise oppressively
or unreasonably the very wide jurisdiction conferred by the sections.
The other safeguard was that persons who were abroad and not able to be
served in the UK in the usual way, were not to be brought here unless the
court granted leave for them to be served abroad. Rule 12.12 of the
Insolvency Rules provided that in insolvency proceedings the court might
order service to be effected abroad 'within such time, on such person, at
such place and in such manner as it thinks fit'.
Thus the second safeguard was that the court had a discretion.
In deciding whether the case was a proper one for service out of the
jurisdiction, one of the circumstances the court would take into account was
the strength or weakness of the plaintiff's claim in the proceedings.
There must be a real issue between the plaintiff and the defendant, which
the plaintiff might reasonably ask the court to try. He must make out a
sufficiently strong case in the circumstances to justify his being given
leave.
Where a foreign element was involved one of the factors which the court
would consider was the apparent strength or weakness of the plaintiff's
claim that the defendant had a sufficient connection with England in respect
of the relief sought.
The present proceedings should be permitted to go ahead in England. It would
be for the judge to decide in the light of the evidence whether the bank had
sufficient connection with England for it to be just for the court to grant
the relief sought. The grant of leave to serve abroad did not preclude the
bank from raising that issue as a defence.
The appeal was allowed. Their Lordships agreed.
For the bank: Nigel Davis (Norton Rose).
For the administrators: Nicholas Merriman QC and Richard Salter (Wilde
Sapte).

FT  10 MAR 92 / Management: Giving a boost to technology ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Entrepreneurs with a technology-based proposal may be failing to raise
venture capital funds because they do not present their ideas to a
sufficiently broad spread of potential backers.
This is the conclusion of a survey of technology oriented venture capital
firms carried out by Korda, a firm specialising in venture capital
technology.
Most entrepreneurs contacted only five or six of the 30 funds prepared to
consider technology proposals. Entrepreneurs tended to rely on personal
contacts or professional advisers to put them in touch with a fund, instead
of consulting any of the directories of venture capital funds, Korda said.
Accountants and other professional advisers contacted up to 10 funds before
losing interest but even they failed to exploit the full range of potential
backers.
By failing to approach a large number of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs
not only risk not obtaining backing.
They may well arrange a deal on less favourable terms than would otherwise
be possible.
Conventional advice to entrepreneurs is that they do not approach too many
venture capitalists for fear of making their proposal look 'shop soiled'.
But the specialist nature of technology proposals means that entrepreneurs
should look as widely as possible, said Jason Loveridge of Korda.
It estimated that venture capitalists looked seriously at about 460
proposals for early stage, technology-based ventures last year with
individual funds looking at only 15 each.
Seventy-five per cent of all proposals were rejected, 5 per cent won backing
and 20 per cent were still undecided.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Management: The time comes to speak up and put up - An array
of visual aids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most people in business can expect to have to make a presentation. It is not
just salesmen and women who have to make a pitch for a customer. Solicitors
and accountants wooing new clients and businessmen seeking finance have all
had to hone their presentation skills.
Increasingly they are turning to visual aids - flip charts, overhead
projectors, slides and videos - to put over their message. For the nervous
and inexperienced, visual aids provide a useful prop while, for the more
seasoned presenter, they can increase the force of the message.
Large companies will often have in-house public relations and marketing
departments to help speakers, but the smaller business will usually have to
go outside for professional help. This need not be prohibitively expensive,
particularly if the business is prepared to do much of the preparatory work
itself.
But visual aids must be handled with care. Unskilled or over-enthusiastic
use can weaken the impact of your presentation and may be positively
counter-productive.
Even quite basic aids, such as the marker pens used on flip-pads or white
boards can be tricky, warns David Turner, a training consultant. 'Speakers
have been known to forget they were holding a pen and write in their ear or
draw lines on their trousers.'
At the other end of the scale, multi-screen slide and video presentations
may sound and look impressive but are more likely to distract the audience
from the presenter's message than enhance its understanding.
'People have come to expect some kind of visual aid, but beware of being too
slick or too technical,' says Francis Bergin, a communications training
consultant. 'Plan your presentation and then decide whether visual aids are
necessary.
The experts suggest the following ground rules:
Do not make excessive use of visual aids. Use them to support your
presentation but not to replace it. You may not be the most charismatic of
speakers, but the most interesting visual aid in the room is you.
Don't compete with your visual aids. Introduce the subject, put up your
slide or transparency, let your audience absorb the information, then take
it down or switch off the projector
Don't take your audience through the text of a visual, word by word. 'Since
most audiences can read, this is a complete waste of time,' writes Lee
Bowman in High Impact Business Presentations.*
Don't attempt to cram in too much information. Your audience will not be
able to absorb it all and may not even be able to read it from the back of
the room.
Don't use visual aids to fill in time. Few people have ever complained that
a presentation was too short. Once you stop talking, the audience can start
asking questions.
Make sure you rehearse your presentation. Check that you have not positioned
projectors, lecterns and chairs so that you trip over wires or block the
view of your audience. Have back-up equipment available if possible.
There is a growing range of visual aids. The simplest ones can be the most
effective and also the least likely to produce technical problems:
Flip-pads and white boards are perhaps more useful in training sessions than
in formal presentations, though they have a role here too. Their main
disadvantage is that the presenter must turn his back on the audience to
write and so may lose their attention.
Some presenters attempt to overcome this problem by standing behind the
flip-pad to write but this looks unnatural and requires an unusual degree of
manual dexterity.
Ready-prepared flip boards are better if the presenter is making a set
presentation. They allow the use of graphs, and diagrams in black and white
or colour are simple to use and easy to transport.
Overhead projectors. These ungainly objects are the workhorse of many
presentations. You can make your own transparencies in black and white or
colour but must use special coloured pens obtainable from stationers.
Unfortunately transparencies are so easy to produce that many presenters
simply make copies of complex tables and detailed text. The result is
excessive detail and a complete loss of graphic effect.
You are advised to have your transparencies prepared by a professional slide
production company. Check the audio visual services section of Yellow Pages.
The Slide House, one London-based producer of audio visuals, quotes Pounds 8
for a black on white transparency (plus VAT) with additional colours from
Pounds 1.25.
Slides can make powerful use of colour, depth and texture and are easily
controlled by the speaker to suit the speed of his delivery. But slide
presentations need careful preparation.
Slides, like family holiday snaps, can seduce the over-enthusiastic
presenter. Keep the number of slides to a manageable level and keep them
informative. Slides of company logos and 'chapter' headings are a
distraction.
If you have a computer capable of producing graphics, you may be able to
make your own slides, but there are plenty of professional slide production
companies which can do it for you.
The slide producers are used to reacting to last-minute requests and most
can respond within 24 hours. But the longer you can give them to work on
your presentation, the more polished it will be.
'Most people leave it up to us to put their material in an attractive
format,' says Malcolm Hearn, a director of The Slide House. The cost of the
slides depends on the colours used and the complexity of the images, but
slides involving simple text, the use of bullet points and graphs or charts
would cost Pounds 15 to Pounds 25 each, plus VAT, he calculates.
Electronic presentations. For all their versatility, slides are static. You
can bring slide images to life by using electronic presentation equipment
which can either feed images to a television set or be projected onto a
larger screen.
Electronic image creation allows you to animate bar charts - making a bar
'grow' on screen, says Martin Conradi, managing director of London-based
Showcase Presentations.
Conradi puts the cost of preparing and mounting a fairly straightforward
presentation at Pounds 2,500-Pounds 3,000, rising to Pounds 4,500-Pounds
5,000 for one involving more elaborate stage props.
Videos provide the impact of a moving image but are not easily integrated
into a presentation. 'A video breaks up your act,' says William Parkhurst in
The Eloquent Executive.**
Despite the popularity of home video shows on TV, audiences are accustomed
to high professional standards so a low-budget corporate presentation may
look rather basic by comparison. And do not let the video run for too long.
Unless you are very entertaining, the audience will soon become bored.
There is a wide choice of video companies if you decide to farm production
out to a professional. Costs vary widely depending on the number of
locations involved, on the props required and whether you want to include
graphics.
VCL Video, a London company, says clients can expect to pay around Pounds
1,000 a minute for a video. Unless there are complications, shooting would
take two to three days and editing a similar length of time.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Management: Patent method to cut court time - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's first county court devoted specifically to hearing patents cases
has succeeded in reducing both the time taken to bring a case to trial and
the duration of the hearing itself.
The patents court at Wood Green, North London, has been involved in 100
cases since September 1990, of which 84 were started in the patent court and
16 transferred from the High Court.
Judgments have been given in eight cases, 21 others were settled out of
court and 10 are listed for trial. Of the cases in which judgments have been
given, the average time from the issuing of a summons to trial was 42 weeks
and the average trial length was 9 1/4 hours.
This is in stark contrast to the High Court, where cases often take more
than two years to get to trial and the actual trial can take much longer
than in the patents court, according to Simon Cohen of solicitors Taylor
Joynson Garrett.

Mobile phones, described by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in last year's
Budget as 'one of the greatest scourges of modern life,' are thought to
increase working efficiency by 86 per cent of users, according to a survey*
for Cellnet by Cranfield School of Management
The owner-managers of small businesses in 'blue collar' sectors, who often
use their vehicle as an office, believe they achieve the greatest increase
in their effectiveness from a mobile phone. They believe their phones
contributed to an 11 per cent rise in their business activity, compared with
a 3 per cent increase noted by 'white collar' small businesses and a 2 per
cent rise recorded by managers in large companies.
More than 40 per cent of business users said their phones were essential; 30
per cent thought they helped in winning business; while less than 10 per
cent saw them as 'a bit of a luxury'.

The Conservative Party is regarded as the party which would be best for
business by just over half of small firms, according to a survey* by
researchers at Kingston Polytechnic.
The conservatives won the backing of 52 per cent of businesses, followed by
Labour with just 11 per cent and the Liberal Democrats with 4 per cent.
Despite the large conservative lead, the poll suggests a fall in
conservative support compared with previous elections. In 1983, 71 per cent
of people engaged in small-scale economic activity voted conservative.
Asked about the banks, almost a quarter of businesses polled said relations
had worsened during 1991 while 19 per cent said they had improved. The
remainder thought relations had stayed the same. In 1990, more than 70 per
cent said relations were good or satisfactory.
The researchers first interviewed 350 small businesses in 1990, but by
February 1992, 16 per cent had ceased to trade or were untraceable.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Technology: Michelangelo makes its mark - Technically
speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cynics are having a field day. The much ballyhooed Michelangelo computer
virus scare seems to have been a false alarm.
Just a couple of thousand personal computers were attacked by the virus last
week, rather than the tens of thousands that had been predicted. Many are
now charging that makers of 'anti-virus' software, which can be used to
detect and eliminate rogue computer virus programs, pulled off a massive
scam with their Michelangelo virus alerts.
Sales of anti-viral software soared over the weeks approaching March 6, the
date on which Michelangelo was set to attack. Some companies have clearly
profited from the virus scare. But many more averted what could have been
devastating losses if their data had been destroyed.
Prompted into checking their personal computers for virus infections by
publicity surrounding Michelangelo, many companies, government agencies and
individual computer users discovered in time that their computers were
contaminated by the virus.
In offices of the State of California, for example, hundreds of infected
computers were found. 'I'd say we would have had serious problems if we
hadn't been so worried by all the hype,' the computer systems manger
acknowledged.
Michelangelo is hardly the first computer virus to spread widely among
computer users. It is, however, one of the most destructive to date. While
most virus programs make computers display annoying messages or send, for
example, a fish floating across the screen, this one wipes out all of the
data on a computer's hard disk.
Michelangelo is also the first computer virus that is known to have widely
infiltrated the personal computer industry itself - the software and
hardware manufacturers. That alone was cause for concern. As many as 25 US
computer companies are believed to have been infected by Michelangelo. Most,
but not all, detected the virus and eliminated it before it got passed on to
customers.
Leading Edge, a 'clone' manufacturer, Da Vinci Systems, a software
publisher, and Intel, the leading manufacturer of microprocessors for
personal computers, issued warnings to their customers. Others have been
reluctant to admit to the problem for fear of liability law suits.
If it has done nothing else, Michelangelo has alerted the computer industry
to the need for more stringent controls to ensure that virus infections,
when they occur, are not inadvertently spread. Some of the biggest names in
personal computer software have instituted new security procedures in the
wake of the Michelangelo scare.
Did the industry cry wolf? Perhaps so, but that does not mean that there are
no predators. Michelangelo has raised awareness of the potential danger that
virus programs may pose and the methods that can be used to protect valuable
data. There are surely many more personal computer users now than there were
a week ago who have made back-up copies of their data.
This simple precaution, urged in every software manual, has been widely
ignored in practice. Yet viruses are not the only cause of data loss, as
anyone who has suffered the failure of a disk drive knows only too well.
And while Michelangelo itself did not live up to its reputation, there is
little doubt that computer viruses are proliferating and that all personal
computer users need to learn how to avoid them.
'Safe computing' has become a necessity. It is a fact of life today that any
floppy disk, whatever the source, may contain a virus. Rather than
dismissing Michelangelo as a hoax, we should regard it as a warning. After
all, Friday the 13th is just around the corner.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Technology: Computers go it alone - Why corporate IT
departments no longer need the human touch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HOLDSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How would you cope if you received 40 postcards a second and had to read
them all because one in 1,000 needed a reply? That's the kind of task that
operators of corporate computers face every day.
Computer-generated messages from all over a company's network arrive at IT
centres as fast as those postcards. The operators, surrounded by banks of
monitors, do their best to sort out the messages and keep the system
running.
But humans cannot react as fast as computers, and whenever they intervene it
slows things down. Only in the late 1980s, with the advent of software
designed to automate some of the operators' tasks, did solutions start to
arrive.
Robots are now available for loading and unloading memory tapes, and
schedulers for pre-arranging the flow of work through a computer over a
period of time. Other automation products will recover failed applications
or start or close the whole system in a safe and systematic way at the press
of a button.
Software can also attack the gush of messages, cutting out the junk-mail and
sending back standard replies. After most messages have been filtered out,
the remaining ones can be displayed on a single screen as a colour-coded
chart, for example. One glance can quickly show how the whole system is
performing.
Another way of cutting down the messages would be to stop writing software
that generates so many. Every year hardware gets faster and faster and more
and more messages are spewed out by software packages that were designed for
a slower environment maybe 20 years ago.
Operators have generally welcomed automation rather than seeing it as a
threat. The new technology makes their job more interesting.
'Software is taking over the grunt work,' says George Kurtz, an automation
expert with Computer Associates, the US systems house. Computer operators
are freed to become computer analysts, a more creative occupation with big
benefits for the employer. 'By the turn of the century I expect them to be
called network engineers. Their role will develop into the management of an
enterprise network.'
Despite its advantages, automated operations has been slow to take off. The
technology, centred on IBM mainframes, is five years old, says Suzanne
Nicastro, director of strategic planning with Legent, a US automation
supplier.
'In the first year, people were just poking at it. Some jumped right on but
others were scared off because it appeared untested or they thought it could
lead to them losing their jobs. Two years ago though it was shooting up like
crazy because there were more visible success stories to point to.'
Since then the recession has slowed things down. 'People have got distracted
and they're trying to make things work that they've already invested in,'
says Nicastro. 'But the automation market is only 25 per cent penetrated, so
there's still a lot of potential there.'
The threat to jobs is not as great as one might expect. US computer centres
are growing at an average of 25 per cent a year in terms of computer power
and workload, says Nicastro. Automated operations allows them to grow at
this rate without increasing staff, she claims.
When automation products first arrived, it seemed that completely unattended
or 'lights-out' computer centres would be the ultimate goal. There would be
no human operators - just a 'babysitter' or security guard.
Nowadays, few companies entertain ambitions of this kind. A more common aim
is to run a computer centre remotely, from a PC at home perhaps, or from
another building if the computer centre is on a split-site. This latter idea
offers big savings for a company faced with integrating two computer sites
after a merger or acquisition.
But the physical location of the nearest human expert is still of concern to
many. 'The idea of leaving a corporate nerve-centre totally unattended sends
chills up and down my spine,' says Kurtz. 'The last data centre I managed
would have sustained serious damage if personnel had not been on site.'
Automated operations have a more wide-ranging significance, he argues. 'It
forces a company to sit down and rethink the way it does everything. If you
want to automate the management of a company then automated operations is
nothing more than the foundation on which to build.'
Current products automate several different operational tasks on mainly IBM
machines. But the future is about systems that work across a wide range of
hardware and integrate the different automation products so that they feed
each other.
Computer Associates claims to be the only company offering such a system
today. Its products are designed for the company's open architecture called
CA90s which embraces any kind of hardware. 'Companies can't afford to build
interfaces to different platforms,' says Kurtz. 'The only way you can solve
the complexity is with an integrated system.'
Such integration promises to unlock the full benefits of automation as it
moves up to the higher levels of a company.
'Eventually it will be like flying an aeroplane,' says Kurtz. 'A jet engine
has maybe 30,000 components and the pilot sits in the middle and controls it
with a couple of levers. Every component is dependent on every other
component. Managing a company will be like that.'

SHELL UK OIL wants its staff to have direct control of the computers they
use.
It is installing a voice-activated system for users who are spread across
many different sites in the UK.  Staff will phone the computer centre in
Manchester and be guided through a digitised meny to trigger the computer
programs they want.  They will be able to request recorded information,
cancel an application when it goes wrong, or speak to a human being, for
example.
This is part of the company's move into automated operations.  An automation
product called OPS/MVS from Goal Systems of the US is the hub of a strategy
that will move most operators away from Shell's central control room.
'Nowadays operators are not necessary for things like lifts, cashpoint
machines or phone calls - all of these gave users direct control of their
environment.  There's no reason why the same ideas are not applicable to
us,' says Ian Lowe, automation project leader.
All electronic messages coming into Shell's computer from various parts of
the network will be handled automatically.  Only 0.2 percent need a human
reaction.  These will be filtered out and relayed via BT to experts who
could be based anywhere.
'We're removing the trivia from the operators' job and giving them an
opportunity to get involved in more rewarding activities,' says Lowe.

BOB JONES is one of his computer's best friends.  Sometimes it phones him up
to tell him its problems.
Jones is technical services manager at Physicians Mutual, an insurance
company in Omaha, Nebraska.  The company was one of the first in the US to
use automated operations software and last year took a further step by
introducing two new products developed by the US automation supplier Candle
Corporation.
One of these, AF/Performer, monitors and tunes the computers automatically.
 When it was installed, it uncovered technical problems and inefficiences
that no one had noticed before.  The other product, AF/Remote, allows the
computer to phone someone for help it it gets into trouble.
Together, the products allow the computer to work unattended.  This has
allowed Physicians Mutual to end weekend shifts for computer operators and
save more than Dollars 8,000 (Pounds 4,500) a year.
'If AF/Performer faces a problem, it attempts to correct it first, but if it
can't it calls out through, AF/Remote to an operator with a PC,' explains
Jones.
AF/Performer hs already saved four stoppages which would have knocked out
600 terminals and cost the company several thousand dollars.  'We haven't
eliminated any staff.  We've redirected them from being a slave to the
machine to making the machine a slave to them,' says Jones.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Technology: Taxing time for software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robin Cooke-Hurle, managing director of Taxsoft, a small software house, has
a recurring nightmare before the UK's annual Budget day. The chancellor of
the exchequer gets to his feet, discusses the economy and then announces a
raft of new legislation giving big tax advantages to the software industry.
Equally substantial changes to Taxsoft's programs will be required.
Cooke-Hurle wakes in a cold sweat.
Taxsoft is one of the few companies specialising in taxation software for
corporations and for personal taxation. It claims that eight of the top 10
accountancy firms use its products and that the tax departments of 20 per
cent of the UK's top 500 companies are customers, giving it an 80 per cent
share of the corporate tax market.
Tax software suppliers are a small, exclusive club. At the upper end of the
spectrum there are only a handful of competitors including CSM, Data
Sciences and Solution 6.
Each year, the race is to get the latest version of the software,
incorporating all the Budget changes, out to clients within 24 hours of
Budget day. If the new version is late, Taxsoft's customers lose competitive
advantage; if it is pushed out too soon, its integrity could be compromised.
The company employs two full-time tax specialists, recruited from large
companies, and about a dozen programmers. The most difficult part of the
operation is finding ways for the tax experts to communicate with the
programmers. 'We have not solved that one yet,' Cooke-Hurle muses. The
company has its own language, appropriately called 'T' to describe tax
legislation.
Customers pay a yearly fee - which varies according to the size and
complexity of the version - for the software which includes all
modifications and alterations. In this election year, for example, there
could be two Budgets.
But it is profitable work. With a turnover of about Pounds 2m, the gross
profit margin is about 30 per cent.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Unified companies register announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPANY REGISTER which should help to improve the quality of the
government's economic statistics was announced yesterday by the Treasury.
The Pounds 4.3m system will be financed by the Central Statistical Office
and the Department of Employment, and should be ready next year. It will
replace the two separate registers now held by the departments.
The new business register will hold details about companies on computer,
including the nature of their businesses and their annual sales figures. The
information will help production of statistical surveys.
Although a Commons committee suggested the creation of a single register 26
years ago, the two systems have continued separately. Discrepancies between
the two registers are thought sometimes to lead to errors in official data.
The CSO says the new register offers the prospect of a reduced burden on
businesses. Theoretically, at least, fewer companies should have to provide
information on sales and other matters.

FT  10 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): No improvement seen in reading
standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
READING standards in primary schools in England and Wales have failed to
improve in the past year in spite of last year's national tests for
seven-year-olds, according Her Majesty's Inspectorate.
Reading standards were found to be poor in about 20 per cent of schools and
good in 37 per cent. The inspectorate concluded in its report, published
yesterday, that: 'Poor standards were strongly associated with weakness in
the quality of teaching and in the organisation and management of work in
the classroom.'
The report will fuel the debate about teaching methods in primary schools. A
government report in January called for greater emphasis on formal
instruction.
The inspectorate broadly confirms the results of last year's tests, which
found that 28 per cent of pupils had not reached the reading standards set
for their age group. It notes that the tests themselves have improved the
assessment of reading standards.
The report said that teachers felt 'poorly equipped' for the task of
teaching children with serious reading difficulties.
The report also noted the importance of the home environment, saying: 'The
positive influence of parents was strongly evident in the performance of
many of those children who were competent readers at an early stage.'
Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, has asked chairmen of local
education authorities to take 'an active and critical interest' in raising
reading standards.

FT  10 MAR 92 / MoD promises more backing for contractors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence is promising to release more information to
contractors about its purchasing plans and to provide more backing for the
early phases of new-technology projects.
The initiative by Mr Alan Clark, defence procurement minister, is an effort
to head off complaints from the industry about the lack of support and
guidance.
It coincides with a campaign launched by the Society of British Aerospace
Companies for more government support in the face of defence cuts and
declining civil business.
Manufacturers gave the initiative a cautious welcome, but said they would
need to see how it worked in practice.
Mr Clark, who is to stand down at the general election, called last
September for the views of leading defence companies. That was followed by
consultations with individual industrialists, the society and the Defence
Manufacturers' Association.
The association plans to brief its members on the initiative tomorrow.
Leading contractors are to be invited to a private conference with ministers
and MoD officials in July. Chaired by Mr Malcolm McIntosh, the ministry's
chief of defence procurement, it will be the first such meeting to bring
together suppliers of air, sea and land equipment, and is to be repeated
annually.
Mr Clark said MoD procurement staff had been asked to be 'as forthcoming as
possible' about plans.
He also announced an extra Pounds 40m this year for 'technology demonstrator
programmes' in areas such as electronics, armour, radar and computer
software.
'These can offer practical evidence of the feasibility of a technology,
reduce risk in subsequent development programmes, and focus resources on
those areas of technology likely to offer the best return on investment,' he
said.
At the same time the MoD is to study the feasibility of developing new
systems without immediately proceeding to production.
A second study is to be carried out into the implications for defence
procurement of integrating design, manufacturing and support engineering in
a single process.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Misery Index gives President a headache
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN INCUMBENT President Jimmy Carter lost the 1980 election, the Misery
Index - the sum of inflation and unemployment - had reached almost 20 per
cent. It is now hovering around 10 per cent, suggesting that President
George Bush has a much greater chance of retaining power in November.
Mr Bush's campaign managers, however, would be the first to admit that the
economy is a headache. On some measures, consumer confidence is languishing
at its lowest level for 17 years.
Real per capita incomes have not grown since Mr Bush was elected. Perhaps
the most fertile source of economic discontent is a growing awareness that
top earners creamed off much of the increase in national income during the
past decade.
Figures from the Congressional Budget Office show that the bottom
four-fifths of the population received a meagre 6 per cent of the total
increase in post-tax incomes between 1977 and 1989.
The Bush team also must contend with a business cycle that has stubbornly
defied its predictions. A year ago, Mr Michael Boskin, the president's chief
economic adviser, was confidently forecasting a sustained recovery beginning
last spring.
By now the economy was supposed to be growing at an annual rate of 3-4 per
cent, giving voters renewed confidence in Republican economic management.
Instead the recovery fizzled out last August, leaving the economy becalmed
for two quarters.
The good news, in the memorable words of Mr Nicholas Brady, Treasury
Secretary, is that robins are back on the lawn again. Signs of recovery have
proliferated in recent weeks.
The most unexpected was last Friday's much better than expected employment
report. Employment surged by 164,000 last month, compared with analysts'
expectations of a gain of 10,000. Some of the gain was suspect: the increase
of 133,000 jobs in retailing may reflect faulty adjustments. Nevertheless,
the overall increase in jobs - and in hours worked - suggests incomes and
production are rising.
The employment jump followed a surge in the Purchasing Managers' Index, a
reliable barometer of industrial health. The index seems to have broken
decisively through the 50 per cent level, which is the threshold for an
expanding manufacturing economy. A broad leading employment index compiled
by economists at Columbia University also rose sharply last month. And the
Commerce Department's composite index of leading indicators was up
noticeably in January, after falling in the previous two months.
Residential housing has shown definite signs of improvement.
New home sales rose 12.9 per cent in January to an annual rate of 622,000,
the highest level for nearly two years. Boosted by lower mortgage rates,
home sales are running about 20 per cent higher than last summer. Housing
starts and building permits are also up significantly.
The evidence of recovery in other sectors is more tentative. Retail sales
rose 0.6 per cent in January and were revised up in previous months.
Encouraging reports from department stores suggest another increase last
month. Car sales seemed to be improving early in February but lost momentum
towards the end of the month.
Many analysts are also cheered by more rapid growth of the money supply.
Bank reserves and M1, the narrowest measure of money, are growing at
double-digit rates. More important, M2, a broader aggregate that has a
closer historical relationship with economic activity, has moved toward the
centre of its 2.5-6.5 per cent target range.
These are encouraging signs. But there are many reasons to fear that any
recovery will be lacklustre. The Federal Reserve is especially agitated by
the fragility of confidence in the bond market - probably a reflection of
deteriorating fiscal trends. In spite of falling inflation, long bond yields
have risen since early January and are again only a whisker below 8 per
cent.
This has led to a fresh upward move in mortgage rates which is choking off
the housing recovery - which, in any case, is much less robust than usual
because of chronic overbuilding of offices, hotels and residential apartment
blocks.
Consumer fundamentals are also poor. Savings rates and confidence are low.
Incomes are static. Debt burdens are still at historically high levels.
Unlike in previous recessions, there will be no big lift from a loosening of
fiscal policy. If tax cuts are agreed this year - which is still doubtful -
they will be minuscule.
The bottom line is that Mr Bush can probably reckon on a weak recovery in
the second half of this year, with gross domestic product growing at an
annual rate of 2-3 per cent. But such a recovery could fizzle out as
happened last year. Even if it does not, it may seem feeble to an electorate
reared on post-war recoveries that typically saw growth spurts of 6 per cent
or more. The economic signs are thus positive but not sufficiently so to
prevent the leading Democratics from capitalising on recent disappointments.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Bush sure of his prize in 'home state' of Texas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush has not even bothered to campaign in his adopted home
state of Texas in the past 10 days, so sure he is of a convincing win.
The campaign of the right-wing Republican challenger, Mr Patrick Buchanan,
who originally made Texas a target state, says that '25-30 per cent would be
a major victory'. This would be less, for example, than the uncommitted vote
in South Dakota, when Mr Bush ran unopposed.
Among the Democrats, Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton's campaign has been up
and running in Texas since December, and is far better organised than that
of his chief rival, former Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas.
Mr Clinton's populist style goes down well in Texas, and he has portrayed Mr
Tsongas as an out-of-touch north-easterner, the 'Wall Street' candidate.
President Bush, says Mr Arnie Vedlitz, a political scientist at the Texas
A&amp;M University, will probably suffer less in Texas from the protest vote
that has hurt his campaign in the rest of the country.
The president, whose legal residence is in Houston, Texas, has close ties
with the local Republican party, and, notes Mr Vedtz, 'conservative
Republicans do not feel alienated here, because they have not been shut out
of the system'.
Mr Buchanan's resort to racist themes has not gone down well in a state
where around 40 per cent of the population are black or Hispanic, and where
immigration has long been accepted by both Democratic and Republican
parties. Republicans in Texas are, for example, opposed to making English
the official language, and like most Texans, are enthusiastic supporters of
the proposed Mexico-US free trade pact - which Mr Buchanan has railed
against.
However, conservative Texans are still smarting from the president's U-turn
on taxes, and the poor state of the economy. But here again, Mr Bush is
likely to fare a little better than in the rest of the country. Texas's
recession started much earlier than in the rest of the US, and recovery of
sorts is on the way.
The stakes for Mr Clinton in Texas are high, since he is overwhelming
favoured to win. In the latest opinion poll, Mr Clinton scored 41 per cent
against 18 per cent for Mr Tsongas. As Walter Dean Burnham, a political
scientist at the University of Austin says: 'If he fails in Texas that will
be the end of him.'
Mr Clinton, from neighbouring Arkansas state, is by far the richest
Democratic candidate, with his campaign team saying it hopes to have raised
Dollars 1m in the state (when final figures are out). Mr Tsongas has found
it very difficult to raise his visibility in a state where two months ago he
was unknown and where it is expensive to make any impact in the highly
diverse media market.
Mr Clinton's position to the left of Mr Tsongas will help in a state where
Democratic primary voters are now mainly minorities, union supporters, or
traditional liberals.
Mr Clinton has been backed by the 95,000-strong Texas state teachers
association, the governing body of the state Democratic party,
Mexican-American organisations, the state land commissioner and several
prominent unions. It was the ability to attract these sorts of endorsements
that helped Mr Michael Dukakis sweep the Texas primary four years ago.
The character issue may haunt Mr Clinton down the road - if he gets that far
 -but for Texas Democrat primary voters it has made little impact, with no
significant drop in Mr Clinton's support between January and February. Texan
Democrats are generally tolerant of personal vices.
Mr Tsongas is thus playing an expectations game, with a campaign spokesman
saying the candidate is hoping for a strong second place, aided by likely
support from well-off suburban voters in the Austin area. He opened up his
office in Austin only two weeks ago, and the first night had to work by
candlelight, thanks to a lack of electricity. 'We don't have the
organisation of the leading candidate' admits a spokesman, 'but we are
relying on personal character and the message'.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Miyazawa pledges more reform after by-election defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday pledged to
redouble his efforts to carry out political reform in the wake of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party's defeat in an important by-election.
However Diet members doubt whether Sunday's defeat will actually galvanise
Mr Miyazawa and other LDP leaders into action.
Instead, argument over possible reforms and over the current spate of
corruption scandals is likely to continue to blight proceedings in the Diet.
This will slow discussion over other serious issues facing the government -
including measures to stimulate the economy, the possible opening of the
rice market, and plans to increase Japan's contribution to United Nations
peacekeeping forces.
Sunday's poll in Miyagi, in northern Japan, for a seat in the Diet's lower
house was won by Mr Koki Hagino, a university professor backed by opposition
parties and by the political arm of Rengo, Japan's trade union federation.
Mr Hagino narrowly defeated an LDP candidate in a rural constituency which
had once been a ruling party stronghold.
According to newspaper opinion polls, voters in Miyagi were concerned about
the slowdown in the economy and about hints the government might relax a ban
on rice imports.
However their anger was mostly directed at Mr Miyazawa's failure to tackle
political reform.
Commentators saw the verdict as a measure of widespread public discontent
with LDP-dominated politics. The Yomiuri newspaper said yesterday: 'The
problem is that the LDP has no concrete policies. They have nothing with
which to engage people in a political debate.'
However, opposition parties also have little credit with voters. The Yomiuri
said: 'This is a crisis not only for the LDP but also for the opposition
which has lost the ability to solve problems.'
The LDP now has little time to recover voters' trust before two more
by-elections in the spring followed by a national election for seats in the
Diet's upper house in July.
The party lost its majority in the upper house in 1989, during the Recruit
stocks-for-favours scandal. It seems certain to lose more ground this year
as voters protest about more recent affairs.

FT  10 MAR 92 / World leaders praise Begin's peace role
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAELI, US and Egyptian leaders praised Mr Menachem Begin, the former prime
minister of Israel who died yesterday, for his role in forging an historic
peace agreement with Egypt, as thousands gathered on Jerusalem's Mount of
Olives to attend the simple Jewish burial ceremony he had requested.
Foreign tributes praised Mr Begin, who was 78, for signing the Camp David
peace agreement with Egypt, ratified in 1979, under which Israel gave up the
Sinai Peninsula, captured in the 1967 Six Day War, and won in exchange an
unprecedented peace treaty with an Arab state.
They avoided mention of his more controversial past as violent underground
leader against British rule in Palestine in the 1940s, his militant
commitment to eternal Israeli rule over the other occupied territories or
the bloody 1982 invasion of Lebanon, a debacle which contributed to Mr
Begin's surprise decision to retire in 1983.
His 'very courageous, foresighted role at Camp David' would never be
forgotten, said US President George Bush, a sentiment echoed by Mr Jimmy
Carter, president at the time of the accords and a vital catalyst in their
negotiation.
Egyptian leaders joined the praise, taking the opportunity to call on Mr
Begin's successors to follow his path of giving up occupied territory in
exchange for peace in the current Middle East talks. 'His understanding of
land for peace paid great service to the peace process,' said Mr Amr Moussa,
Egypt's foreign minister.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, who took part in the
Camp David negotiations on the Egyptian side, said he hoped 'that the new
generation of leaders in Israel and the Arab world will have the same
courage and political determination'.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the present Israeli premier and Mr Begin's successor as
leader of the right-wing Likud party, led a large array of Israeli political
colleagues and rivals who joined the Begin family at the graveside. But the
burial according to Jewish religious practice, on the day of death, meant
there was no time for mourners from abroad to arrive. Foreign governments
were represented by the Spanish ambassador to Israel.
Mr Begin died in hospital after a heart attack a week ago. He was buried
alongside his wife Aliza and late fellow-fighters in the Irgun Zva'i Leumi,
the Jewish guerrilla band he led in the 1940s.
The mourners were led by his son Mr Ze'ev Binyamin Begin, a Likud MP who has
already signalled his intention of one day succeeding his father as party
leader.

East Timor yesterday, ignoring US and Australian warnings that their plan to
lay wreaths at the site of a massacre of pro-independence demonstrators
might provoke a stern response from Indonesia.
The protesters, on board the Portuguese car ferry Lusitania Expresso, have
been barred from Indonesian waters, and will face a naval blockade.
The protest is intended to demonstrate Portuguese sovereignty over East
Timor, which was invaded by Indonesia in 1975, and annexed the following
year. The annexation has not been recognised by the United Nations.
Portuguese President Mario Soares meanwhile strongly criticised the US and
Australia for having double standards over the annexation and the continued
abuse of human rights in Lisbon's former colony. Indonesia has admitted that
at least 50 East Timorese demonstrators were killed in November, when troops
opened fire on a funeral march in Dili, the capital. Witnesses say the death
toll may have been much higher.
The massacre has been criticised by western governments, although protests
have been muted since an Indonesian inquiry recommended disciplinary action
against several army officers.
However, the Australian and US governments have urged the protesters to
avoid provoking Indonesia.
Mr Soares, in an interview with the daily newspaper Publico, said the
international community 'cannot have two weights and two measures' regarding
human rights abuses and Indonesia's actions in East Timor. 'Unhappily, there
are great countries that have a very clear position regarding human rights
in one case and not in others. This is unfortunately the case of the United
States,' Mr Soares said.

PAKISTAN has merged three branches of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International with a government-owned bank, AP reports from Islamabad.
The merger is based on terms set by the liquidators of BCCI, the state-run
Habib Bank and the central bank, the finance ministry said.
'Under the merger plan, the assets and liabilities of the three
Pakistan-based branches of BCCI will vest Habib Bank Limited, which will
manage them through a subsidiary. All unencumbered deposits and claims will
be payable in full.'
Although BCCI branches worldwide closed last year following disclosures of
massive fraud, BCCI Pakistan continued to operate and depositors were
allowed to withdraw up to the equivalent of Dollars 4,000.

<TEXT>
GEC Alsthom's Metro-Cammell subsidiary yesterday announced an order to
supply eight eight-car electric multiple unit trains to Hong Kong's Mass
Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC).
No terms were disclosed for the contract, which totals 48 motor-vehicles and
16 trailers, and includes an option for up to three extra eight-car trains.
The rolling stock will be assembled in Hong Kong by Metro-Cammell for
delivery between March 1994 and August 1995. GEC Alsthom said the trains
would enable the MTRC to cope with forecast growth in passenger traffic at a
time when an increasing number of vehicles will be undergoing half-life
maintenance. The trains will be interchangeable with the existing fleet and
include new energy-saving electronic motor-control equipment. This is being
fitted to the present fleet by Metro-Cammell.

RENAULT Vehicules Industriels (RVI), the French state-owned bus and truck
maker, is near finalising a joint venture with Karosa, a Czechoslovakian
company that makes buses and fire engines, William Dawkins reports from
Paris.
The two have signed a letter of intent for what will be RVI's most
significant eastern European investment. The deal is expected to be
completed by May. It is part of a push by RVI into east Europe, coming after
two defeats against German competitors for alliances in Czechoslovakia. RVI
lost to Germany's Mercedes-Benz in January in a battle for a partnership
with Avia, the Czechoslovak truck maker. RVI's car-making parent, Renault, a
year earlier had tried to get control of Skoda, but lost to Volkswagen of
Germany.
RVI and Karosa have been talking since December. RVI would take at least a
31 per cent stake in Karosa, in line with the Mercedes-Benz investment in
Avia, for a sum to be settled. RVI would modernise Karosa's plant at Vysoke
Myto, eastern Bohemia, adapting its production lines to make RVI trucks of
9-15 tonnes. Karosa's output of 1,500 vehicles a year compares with its
4,000-vehicle capacity.

FT  10 MAR 92 / World Trade News: US chipmakers fear failure for pact with
Japan - Executives' frustration is growing at lack of progress in market
opening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US-Japanese semiconductor trade agreement, signed last June, 'is on the
threshold of failure,' says a US semiconductor industry report to be
presented to President Bush this week. The report, Heading Toward Crisis,
reflects the frustration among executives at the lack of progress in opening
the Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.3bn) Japanese chip market to foreign suppliers.
Weary of a decade-long trade battle, US chip makers are gathering in
Washington this week to press the Bush administration to take a tougher
stand. The 1991 US-Japan accord, the second semiconductor trade pact between
the two countries, specified a 20 per cent foreign market share be
established in Japan by the end of this year.
But for the past two years, the foreign share of the Japanese market has
remained virtually stagnant at about 14 per cent, the US chipmakers say. 'To
avoid the increased trade friction that will inevitably result from failure
to achieve the semiconductor agreement's objectives, the industries and
governments must take immediate and decisive action,' the report states.
'The US government should (also) begin considering what additional actions
are appropriate if foreign market share does not substantially increase.'
What those actions should be 'is up to the government,' say the executives.
While they stop short of urging economic sanctions, there is no doubt these
would be sought if rapid improvement fails to occur in market access. US
industry anger over the Japanese chip trade imbalance has been worsened
recently by concerns that Japanese semiconductor producers may again be
dumping memory chips at below-cost prices in the US and third-country
markets.
Dumping was the issue that ignited the US-Japanese 'chip wars' in the early
1980s. US semiconductor makers are now alarmed by a sharp fall in the prices
of memory chips produced in Japan and Korea. Several US companies are
gathering data, ahead of a possible dumping suit. The row is coming to a
head when the Japanese chip market is in a decline. Sales of semiconductor
devices in Japan fell 6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1991. Japanese
officials say the recent dip in chip imports reflects market conditions. But
they have said in the past that fast growth in the Japanese market explained
small rises in foreign market share.
'If foreign share cannot increase in fast growth times, and cannot increase
in slow growth times, when can it improve?' the US industry asks. 'The
American industry has heard ample excuses. What Japan and America need now
is results.' The US chipmakers expect a mixed reception in Washington this
week. While they have support in Congress, the industry is becoming
increasingly dissatisfied with the Bush administration.
They are critical of Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, who, some
charge, is 'more interested in potato chips than semiconductor chips'. The
US industry is set to make its battle an issue in the presidential election
campaign and has sponsored a national poll on trade and competitiveness
issues.
The results, to be announced this week, suggest heavy support for stronger
government action on behalf of US high-technology industries. Asked if
penalties were justified against countries agreeing to open their markets to
US products, then failing to, 73 per cent said 'Yes'. Support for economic
sanctions stayed firm (67 per cent), even if that meant paying higher prices
for some consumer products. Some 73 per cent were dissatisfied with Japan's
response to trade issues raised by the US. By stressing their role in the US
electronics industry, the US's biggest industrial employer, chipmakers aim
to raise support to pave the way for possible sanctions against Japan.

FT  10 MAR 92 / OECD urges Norway to curb state subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S Labour government was yesterday advised to curb state subsidies and
open the country's financial markets to foreign competition.
These are among the conditions needed to support a durable revival from the
economic shock inflicted by the mid-1980s oil price fall, argues the annual
survey on Norway by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD).
A hesitant recovery is on the way, with gross domestic product (GDP) likely
to grow by 2.9 per cent in 1993 from 2 per cent this year, says the OECD.
Growth in oil output should lead to a big current account surplus of nearly
6 per cent of GDP next year, it adds.
Despite Oslo's attempt to reduce the economy's dependence on oil, the OECD
finds that it has used too much oil wealth to raise the share of state
spending in national income, to nearly 65 per cent of non-oil GDP last year.
This includes 'lavish regional subsidies, targeted subsidies to maintain the
international competitiveness of ailing industries and record levels of
support to agriculture'.
This is an inefficient way of stimulating the economy and distracts
entrepreneurs from the pursuit of efficiency, says the report. It advises
Oslo to consider using oil income to reduce taxes instead.
It singles out Norway's crisis-stricken banking system, where bad debts,
piled up during the economic slowdown, have undermined confidence in the
solvency of banks, forcing the government to pump cash into the sector. The
study warns that a balance must be struck between restoring the stability of
the banks and not 'giving signals which could . . . encourage careless
behaviour by banks and their clients'. Banks 'must not become a new outlet
for permanent subsidies', it says.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Recession slashes trade surplus to just DM50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S foreign trade surplus virtually disappeared in January as
recession in the country's main markets caused a slowdown in exports, writes
Christopher Parkes.
The surplus shrank to just DM50m (Pounds 17.3m) from DM5.1bn in December and
DM1.3bn in the comparable month in 1991, and was the lowest since last
July's DM200m. At the same time the current account deficit rose to DM6.4bn
from DM1.7bn in December and DM2.1bn a year earlier, the federal statistics
office said yesterday.
Exports and imports of goods were both down on the year, reflecting slowing
economic growth. However, overseas sales of DM54.38bn compared with DM57bn,
fell more than imports, which dropped DM1.36bn to DM54.33bn.
The current account figures included a DM2.2bn deficit in services and one
of DM4.1bn in 'other payments'. A breakdown of separate east and west German
contributions is expected in the next two weeks.
Germany's trade deficit with the Far East, meanwhile, is causing increasing
concern.
Exports to the region rose only 2.6 per cent last year while imports jumped
25 per cent, according to Mr Edgar Nordmann, president of the East Asia
Association, a Hamburg traders' group. Net result was a one-third increase
in the deficit to a record DM38.7bn, he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR STEFANOS Manos, Greece's new economy minister, is likely to spend much of
this week besieged in his office. Striking workers in the banking and power
sectors, as well as bus depot employees, will gather at the ministry
building in central Constitution Square from today, protesting against the
conservative government's decision to freeze public sector wages this year.
Four days of walk-outs are timed to coincide with the debate in parliament
on legislation banning pay increases for workers in state-owned
corporations. The government says a pay freeze is the only way to ensure
that both unions and heads of public sector enterprises obey the call for
austerity.
Mr Manos, 52, may be the right man to enforce harsh measures. As environment
minister, he launched the much-delayed Athens Metro project last year, but
then walked out of the cabinet when his plea to stay on and tackle the
city's pollution problem was rejected. But he will need all the persistence
with which he is credited if Greece is to make up lost ground after a
miserable economic performance in 1991, the first year of a three-year
stabilisation programme launched in return for an Ecu2.2bn (Pounds 1.56bn)
loan from its European Community partners. The government is already in the
embarrassing position of being denied the second Ecu600m tranche of the loan
which was due last month. It will not be paid unless the government can
present the European Commission with a new five-year convergence plan by the
summer, enabling Greece to participate in European Monetary Union. The plan
would have to outline the government's strategy to reduce inflation and the
budget deficit.
Little progress was made towards last year's targets for reducing the public
sector deficit by trimming the civil service payroll, cracking down on tax
evasion and raising extra revenues through privatisation and sales of state
land.
The government's ambitious plans were later modified or simply postponed
because of fears that reform would alienate conservative voters.
The government borrowing requirement fell by fewer than three percentage
points last year to around 14 per cent of gross domestic product, compared
with a target of 10.5 per cent. The budget deficit for last year was almost
Dr600bn (Pounds 1.76bn) more than projected.
The only bright spot last year was a 60 per cent drop in the current account
deficit, which declined to Dollars 1.46bn as imports slowed in response to
shrinking consumer demand. The inflation rate is forecast to fall this year
from 18.1 per cent to 13.5 per cent. But this target may be hard to achieve
even with a wage freeze since more administered prices are being
liberalised, while private sector workers are expecting pay increases of at
least 15 per cent.
To improve revenues this year, Mr Manos is expected to press the Finance
Ministry to speed up computerised checking of returns from businesses and
self-employed professionals, and to carry out its promise to bring 60,000
farmers into the tax net this year.
But Mr Manos's biggest problem will be to convince the cabinet that his
fellow EC finance ministers will be reluctant to release any more of the
loan until a long overdue law to reform the pension system takes effect.
Draft legislation, which would reduce welfare spending, has been ready for
several months, but the government is delaying its introduction in
Parliament for fear of triggering a prolonged confrontation with the
socialist opposition.

DOZENS of heavily armed Armenian militants surrounded a former Soviet
anti-aircraft missile base inside Armenia yesterday, killing two soldiers of
the Commonwealth of Independent States and taking the commander hostage,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
About 60 Armenians, who launched the attack on Sunday night at Artik, near
the Turkish border, were demanding the handover of heavy weapons for their
war against Azerbaijan, according to the CIS military command.
The two former Soviet republics are fighting for control of
Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenian-dominated enclave within Azerbaijan. Both
sides have reported death tolls in the hundreds in the past two weeks. More
than 1,500 have died in four years of warfare.
Howitzers and tank guns boomed across the disputed enclave yesterday,
drowning out talk of peace between the two sides.
Elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, violence continued in the month-long
civil war in Georgia. An explosion in the town of Zugdidi, in the west of
the republic , killed three policemen and injured several others.
In the republic of Moldova yesterday, peace talks were due to start after a
week of clashes between ethnic Russians and majority Romanian speakers in
which at least 10 people have been killed.
John Lloyd, in Baku, Azerbaijan, adds: Nationalist leaders in Azerbaijan
yesterday stepped up the pressure on the interim government of the republic
to dissolve parliament and to form a coalition government with a strong
contingent of nationalists and former opposition figures. The aim of such a
coalition would be to pursue a more active prosecution of the conflict in
Nagorno Karabakh - to hit back at the Armenian forces after a string of
reverses.
Mr Niazi Ibragimov, deputy chairman of the Azerbaijani Popular Front - the
focus for opposition nationalist forces - called for the dissolution of
parliament and the passing of more power to the 50-strong National Council.
The council is equally balanced between oppositionists and former communists
whose orientation is now uncertain in the wake of the resignation last week
of President Ayaz Mutalibov, a former leader of the Azerbaijani communist
party.
Kazakhstan told Nato yesterday it would not attend the meeting of the
Co-operation Council that will draw former Soviet republics into an
east-west forum on security, Reuter reports from Brussels. The republic said
it was unable to attend 'for practical reasons'. Kazakhstan has already
failed to turn up to other meetings at Nato to discuss arms control.

FT  10 MAR 92 / Berlin to launch pay strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIRST wave of official warning strikes among public sector employees is
expected to hit Germany today following a call for action yesterday from the
leadership of the DAG white-collar workers' union, writes Christopher
Parkes.
Angered by last week's 3.5 per cent pay offer in the face of its 10.5 per
cent claim, the union said government, state and local authorities had
inflamed the situation and had 'obviously adopted a strategy of conflict'.
Protest stoppages, due to start in Berlin this morning, are expected to
spread across the country between now and the next round of negotiations,
due on March 19.
Rail passengers in the Cologne area were given their first taste of trouble
to come yesterday when, according to the local rail authorities, 'a handful'
of level crossing and signal box workers delayed nine trains for up to 20
minutes.
Meanwhile, the government, which is determined to rein in pay increases in
all sectors, sent further signals that it is not willing to sacrifice
economic and monetary stability to unreasonable pay claims.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl told regional party leaders of his Christian
Democratic Union (CDU) that German stability was important both at home and
abroad.
'If we go down on our knees then the (economic) improvements in the new
federal states will be further slowed,' he said in Bonn.
Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, said pay awards must be related to
the current economic conditions. The minister, who has been widely attacked
for his insistence that increases must be held below 5 per cent, said that
if demands were not restrained the west German economy faced more than
'short-term disruption'.
OTV, the largest of the two main public service unions which together
represent some 2.3m workers, said at the weekend that unless the employers
improved their offer at the next round of talks the negotiations would be
formally ended and a strike ballot called.
Its leaders are also expected to call warning strikes within the next few
days, adding weight to the DAG initiative.

THE label on the dark grey Chinese-made men's suit claimed 'pure new wool,'
and bore the International Wool Secretariat's symbol of quality, the
Woolmark. Analysis showed the suit to be 68.1 per cent polyester.
The label on a made-in-China sweater combined the pure wool symbol with the
equally famous Lacoste crocodile and the slogan 'pure cotton.'
The fake marks are the tip of an iceberg of Chinese abuse of international
trademarks, licences, copyright and patents, which has angered businessmen
and traders and earlier this year invited the threat of US trade sanctions.
Alerted to the Woolmark abuse, the International Wool Secretariat began
collecting evidence and at a press conference in Beijing warned of tough
action against the culprits. Most are small township and rural enterprises
in the freewheeling southern and eastern coastal provinces of Zhejiang,
Guangdong and Hebei, where enterprising private manufacturers are producing
fake wines, fake watches, fake bicycles and falsely labelled garments.
Manufacturers bring in a suit from Taiwan or Hong Kong, pull it to pieces
and remake it, down to its Made in Hong Kong label and the Hong Kong licence
or serial number. Rolls of appropriate labels are available in city markets.
In Tianjin the IWS found stick-on Woolmarks which attached to a suit could
double its price.
The Ministry of Textile Industry said the market was full of fakes and it
could do nothing, but the Chinese Patent Agency, faced with mounting
criticism abroad of China's abuse of registered trademarks, took action.
Some private stores in Beijing's main shopping street have been fined, but
fines are too small to be a deterrent.

MR Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, has expressed regret
over an incident on Friday in which the captain of a Turkish fishing boat
was shot and killed after ramming a Greek Navy patrol vessel off the island
of Leros.
Mr Mitsotakis said he was sorry about the shooting and hoped this 'small
problem will not affect Greek-Turkish relations in a more permanent way.'
A Greek merchant marine ministry announcement issued earlier did not mention
the captain's death, saying only that shots were exchanged as the Turkish
vessel was being chased out of Greek territorial waters.
It was the first death reported in this kind of incident, which occurs
fairly regularly in the narrow straits between the eastern Greek islands and
Turkey.
Greek-Turkish tension was already high after the collapse last week of the
latest round of United Nations-sponsored talks on the reuniting of Cyprus.

<TEXT>
MR Alasane Ouattara, prime minister of the Ivory Coast, has promised stiff
measures against the political opposition, students and 'law breakers' whose
activities, he said, threatened one of the most far-reaching structural
adjustment programmes under way in Africa.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Ouattara said: 'Last year we
went through a tough period cleansing the economy, making it healthier. Now
it is time to cleanse the political environment.'
Since January the wave of anti-government demonstrations organised by
students and the main opposition party, the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) have
erupted into violent rioting and destruction of property and cars on the
streets of Abidjan.
Last Friday the court gave jail sentences to 12 people for involvement in
the most recent incident. Among those sentenced was Mr Laurent Gbagbo,
leader of the FPI and a member of the National Assembly.
Reacting to the controversial court decision Mr Ouattara said: 'They will
have to know there are laws and if they break them they must be punished. We
need a responsible opposition.'
The prime minister said his 18-month-old 'technocratic' government had moved
swiftly to resuscitate the ailing economy, hit by falling prices, negative
economic growth and external debts of Dollars 14bn.
Last year the government moved from a four-year deficit into a surplus of
CFA15bn (Dollars 54m) on the budget balance before debt service payment.
Radical measures to restructure an estimated CFA1,100bn of domestic debt,
including CFA450bn of arrears owed to the banking sector, are also under
way.
Mr Ouattara said his government's privatisation programme would be speeded
up over the next 12 months with eight companies including the
telecommunication giant sold off to private investors. He ruled out
devaluation of the West African franc zone.

BRAZIL'S President Fernando Collor has admitted for the first time the
damage caused by the wave of corruption scandals surrounding his government.
In an interview with O Globo newspaper at the weekend, Mr Collor said: 'It's
as though there was a dagger in my heart that cannot be pulled out. It just
twists and twists further in, but I tell myself: Bear it, Collor, bear it'.
Mr Collor came to power two years ago on an anti-corruption ticket, pledging
not to make the numerous ministerial changes of previous governments.
However, all but one of his original cabinet have been sacked or resigned,
most under a cloud.
Police are currently investigating the health and labour ministers, who were
dismissed last month. Mr Alceni Guerra, the former health minister,
allegedly favoured friends with contracts at highly-inflated prices. Mr
Antonio Magri, the ex-labour minister and union leader, was allegedly taped
explaining to a subordinate how he had received Dollars 30,000 from a
company for parcelling out its social security dues.
Describing it 'like money falling from the sky,' he allegedly suggested they
work together. He now claims this was an 'honesty test'.
For the first time, Mr Collor referred to his former economy minister, Ms
Zelia Cardoso, who resigned last May, shocking the country with publication
of an authorised biography detailing her personal life while in office.
Mr Collor said: 'It was the first time a woman had held such an important
position. No super-minister of previous governments had so much power. She
wasted an historic opportunity.'

</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was defeated at an important
by-election yesterday, heightening pressure within the party for Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa to step down as prime minister to appease voters disillusioned with
the scandal-tainted government.
The upper house poll in Miyagi, in northern Japan, was narrowly won by a
trade union candidate backed by the Social Democratic Party of Japan, which
had taken the seat in 1989 when the LDP was troubled by an earlier set of
corruption scandals.
In conceding defeat, Mr Miyazawa said that the party had waged an 'excellent
fight' in attempting to regain the seat, but the result and a low voter
turnout highlighted public disaffection with the LDP.
Opposition politicians said the outcome was a significant victory for them,
and showed that the public wanted reforms of the scandal-prone political
system. Mr Tamisuke Watanuki, the LDP secretary-general, said that 'we
deeply regret' failing to win and will 'do our best to revive public trust'.
Mr Miyazawa had campaigned on behalf of his party, although the local
campaign manager had suggested that it would be in the LDP's best interests
if the prime minister stayed away. The branch had wanted to focus its
campaign on local issues, drawing attention away from the scandals at the
party's centre.
The Miyagi area is also an important rice-growing district, and it was
expected that some farmers, traditional LDP supporters, would have deserted
the party or not voted as a protest against the expected liberalisation of
Japan's rice market. One result could be to make the LDP even more cautious
about rice reforms.
It was the LDP's second poll setback in a month, and the party faces a
difficult upper house election in July. Faction leaders are likely to meet
to discuss whether Mr Miyazawa should lead the party into that election or
whether his resignation would improve the LDP's popularity.
The party would have difficulty finding a suitable replacement, particularly
when the most serious of the scandals, alleged bribery by the Tokyo Sagawa
Kyubin trucking company, is still unfolding. And while Mr Miyazawa's faction
has been implicated in a separate bribery episode, Mr Miyazawa himself is
still generally regarded as a relatively 'clean' politician.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Syria and Iran defence link-up: A 'strange marriage' in the
Gulf
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DAMASCUS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SYRIA and Iran have boosted significantly their defence co-operation since
the end of the Gulf crisis, prompting Western suspicions that the two are
actively collaborating in securing weapons of mass destruction, notably
missiles.
There are also fears that the collaboration could ultimately involve joint
efforts to secure a nuclear capability.
Western concerns about strengthening Syrian-Iranian defence links coincide
with a looming international crisis over reports that at least one North
Korean ship is bound for Iran's Gulf port of Bandar Abbas with ballistic
missiles on board destined for Syria.
A Western attache in Damascus described the combination of Iran and Syria as
'potentially very dangerous'.
He said the 'strange marriage' could pose the 'next century's threat to the
Middle East'. Syria, virtually alone among Arab states, supported Iran in
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
Another Western official said there were also indications that Syria and
Iran were building stronger defence links with China and Pakistan, and this
was 'troubling' in the light of fears of the further spread of nuclear
technology following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Syria, which had relied on the Soviet Union as its main arms supplier and
guardian superpower, has been casting around for new allies and sources of
military equipment. China, which is supplying missile technology, is filling
part of the gap.
Syria last month signed a nuclear safeguards agreement with the
International Atomic Energy Agency, entitling it to purchase a small Chinese
nuclear reactor for peaceful use. This is Syria's most significant foray
into the nuclear technology field.
China has also been supplying ballistic missiles to Syria. Last September, a
Chinese vessel with what was believed to have been a cargo of either parts
or complete M-9 short range missiles called at the Syrian port of Tartus.
Washington, meanwhile, is considering whether to order its navy ships in the
Gulf region to board the North Korean vessels (there are conflicting reports
about numbers), believed to be carrying the Scud-C missiles for Syria and
possibly Iran.
Israel itself has not ruled out a military strike against the North Korean
vessels. But the US feels constrained about boarding ships bound for Iran
because its navy deployment in the Gulf is there under United Nations
resolutions aimed at enforcing a trade embargo against Iraq.
THE US would not be empowered to seize the Scud-C missiles under the terms
of the UN resolutions. But a Bush administration official was quoted as
saying that in spite of the fact that US naval vessels could not seize the
weapons, their discovery would provide 'public proof that Syria and Iran
were getting long-range missiles'.
The North Korean Scud-Cs are a more accurate version of the Scud-Bs that
Iraq launched against Israel and Saudi Arab during the Gulf crisis. Syria's
attempts to secure shipments of the North Korean missiles, whose range
extends for about 600 kilometres, coincide with signs of a vigorous renewed
Middle East arms race, with various states seeking to boost their military
capabilities contrary to disarmament trends elsewhere.
Iran, the Gulf states and Syria have been at the forefront of these efforts.
The US has also been meeting Israeli requests for additional, more
sophisticated weaponry, especially to boost its air defences.
Western military attaches in Damascus say that the Syrians have been
utilising their 'war dividend' of up to Dollars 2bn from Gulf states
grateful for Syria's participation in the allied coalition against Iraq to
buy weapons cheaply in Eastern Europe.

MR Jean-Luc Dehaene has been sworn in to succeed Mr Wilfried Martens,
western Europe's longest-serving leader, at the head of Belgium's
centre-left government.
After he and 15 other members of a slimmed-down cabinet were sworn into
office by King Baudouin at the weekend, Mr Dehaene, 51, said he had tried,
but failed, to find a ministerial post for his fellow-Flemish Christian
Democrat and long-time mentor, Mr Martens. He had faced opposition from his
party rank and file which wanted a change after the eight Martens'
governments over the past 13 years.
Continuity of a relatively restrictive fiscal policy and modernisation of
Belgium's financial structure is assured by the fact that Mr Philippe
Maystadt, a French-speaking Christian Democrat, remains finance minister.
But little change is generally expected from a ruling coalition containing
the same four French and Flemish-speaking Christian Democrat and socialist
parties as its predecessor.
Now Belgium has a proper government for the first time since November 24,
Air France's acquisition of a stake in Sabena, the Belgian state carrier, is
likely. The Martens government was unable to decide on the deal, but Mr
Bernard Attali, head of Air France, said yesterday he was sure it would soon
go through.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Stubborn recession finds industry near wits' end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH industry has reached a critical point. 'There is no sign of an end
to the recession, no bright horizons. Our backs are right up against the
wall. The only stuff we can take out now to cut costs is stuff that will
really hurt.'
That gloomy assessment of the choices facing industry, from Mr Fred Heaton,
managing director of the bolting division of T&amp;N, the engineering group, is
echoed throughout British manufacturing. Most companies were prepared for a
recession lasting about a year. Few had planned on a severe one lasting for
much more.
Many manufacturers have come through the last year by shedding staff,
squeezing working capital and dropping plans to renew their car fleets. It
is a common refrain for chief executives to claim that they have not had to
cut into the fabric of their businesses.
But the longer the recession continues the greater the risk that industry
will suffer long term damage. Now manufacturers face the prospect of cutting
into the lifeblood of their businesses - from investment in training to
major capital investment programmes to re-equip factories.
Few industrialists believe the recession will lift before the late autumn.
Mr Heaton of T&amp;N said: 'We planned on being out of recession within a year.
We knew we could go through a year without cutting product development. The
last plan we drew up projected some improvement this October but we are
starting to rule that out now.'
There is a growing scepticism about official forecasts of when the recovery
will finally arrive. As Mr Stuart Moberley, finance director of McKechnie,
the Midlands engineering group, puts it: 'This recession is very stubborn,
people have started to realise that there will no quick fix.'
Most companies have already made deep cuts in their workforce. With those
staff have gone central post rooms, large computer systems have been
replaced by smaller ones, sales staff are driving cars with old plates and
secretaries are averting their eyes from discoloured paintwork.
The claim that this recession has not inflicted a drastic toll upon industry
is borne out at groups such as Benjamin Priest. Employment has been cut by
about 30 per cent, yet the company claims major capital spending plans have
not been cut back - yet. Mr John Ainsworth, managing director, said: 'In the
last recession we had a number of companies which were never going to be
profitable. That is not true this time. What we have left are varied and
profitable businesses which are poised for the upturn. We are not carrying
lame ducks.'
Mr Colin Gaskell, managing director of the 600 Group, the engineering
company, says it has managed to cut costs enough to allow continued
investment in research and development and to break even despite a 50 per
cent dip in new orders for machine tools.
'We are shedding staff but we are not seeing productive capacity destroyed
for ever in the way it was during the last recession,' he said.
Indeed some companies claim their spending upon innovation and training has
become more important as companies find ways to raise productivity and open
up markets without buoyant demand to help them.
Mr Tony Frith, chairman and chief executive of Concentric, the
Birmingham-based speciality chemicals and electrical components maker,
explained: 'We have not cut back on engineering or training. We are spending
more on training to make people more effective, to generate productivity
gains in a recession your have to spend more on people.'
Many companies also claim that innovation has become more important to them
in the recession because the only way to maintain production volumes is to
expand their share of a smaller market through offering more innovative
products.
One of the most striking attempts by a company to sell its way out of
recession has been deployed by W Canning, the speciality chemicals and
electronics group, which has boosted spending on innovation to create
environmentally friendly chemicals for use in waste disposal and transferred
a large portion of its sales effort from the UK to export markets.
Mr David Probert, chairman, explained: 'In a recession our customers are
more receptive to new ideas because they need new products to create sales
much more than when demand is booming.'
Groups such as Wagon Industrial, the Telford-based engineering and
automotive group, are taking a different approach in an attempt to combine
tighter cost control with innovation.
Mr John Hudson, chief executive, explained: 'The growth of the 1980s will
not be repeated. To earn decent profits we will have to do something more
dramatic than simply allow ourselves to be pulled out from recession. So we
have started a strategic review of our cost base, merging factories for
instance, not just to see ourselves through the downturn but to make sure we
can make good profits with the slower growth of the next few years.'
There is an additional reason why the pace of innovation may not be slowing
as expected. Many British companies, in the automotive industry for
instance, are long-term sub-contractors to larger international groups which
assemble vehicles. These customers set the pace of innovation their
suppliers have to match if they want to remain as suppliers in an intensely
competitive car market.
Consumer goods groups such as Hoover, the washing machine manufacturer,
claim they are maintaining investment despite a sustained fall in demand
which has forced it to lay off hundreds of staff at its Welsh factories.
Mr Ian Kyd, Hoover's UK financial controller, commented : 'We need to invest
because, if we do not, we will be left behind. We have not changed our
product development plans at all.'
Most British manufacturers are responding to this recession with more vigour
and confidence than the recession of a decade ago. Managers have a clearer
sense of their priorities. But while the recession may not be cutting a
swathe through British industry, the fabric is starting to get very frayed
in places.
The mechanical engineering and metal working industries, which went into the
recession with a weak record for profitability and investment, are seeing
the closure of many small and medium-sized sub-contractors.
There are worries that industry has become so intent on surviving the depths
of recession that it will fail the test of recovery. Mr Gaskell at the 600
Group said: 'The risk is that there will be fewer companies at the end of
this and we may not be able to respond quickly enough to growth when it
comes because stocks are so low and factories are so lean.'
Mr Tom O'Connor, deputy chairman of Elta Plastics, is concerned about the
long-term damage which may have been done to industry's relations with
banks. 'The biggest danger is that companies and banks will be weaker
financially and, so far, more cautious about investing. The banks simply are
not making the funds available. We should be investing now for the upturn.'
Industry has come through the past year largely by taking the most obvious
escape route: aggressively cutting costs. The next year could be even
tougher. The pressure will not let up but the escape routes will be fewer,
narrower and less obvious.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Major pins poll hopes on tax concessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR will pin his hopes for a fourth consecutive Tory general
election victory on a tax-cutting Budget, in spite of confirmation from the
opinion polls that Labour will start the campaign for an April 9 election
with a narrow lead.
Senior ministers last night promised a 'sensible but popular' Budget
package, combining immediate tax cuts with a programme mapping out further
reductions and tax reform if the Conservatives are re-elected.
Some ministers suggested that this could involve the introduction of a new
20p rate of income tax to apply to the the first two or three thousand
pounds of taxable income. Others, however, predicted a 1p cut in the basic
rate of tax.
As Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, put the finishing touches to his Budget
speech, the consensus among ministerial colleagues was that the initial cost
of the tax cuts would be between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 3bn.
Whitehall officials stressed that Mr Lamont would attribute a sharp rise in
public borrowing next year to the impact of the recession rather than to his
Budget package. The City expects a borrowing requirement in 1992-93 of
around Pounds 25bn.
Labour, however, promised to step up its campaign against any 'Budget
bribes' with a presentation this morning detailing how the money could be
better spent on the National Health Service. Opposition strategists said
they were confident they had 'neutralised' in advance the political impact
of a 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax.
The strategists also confirmed that a future Labour government would press
ahead with an 'open-minded' review of the case for electoral reform -
including proportional representation, by enhancing the status of the
present Plant committee, set up two years ago.
Mr Major, who spent yesterday at his Huntingdon home, finalised the election
preparations during a telephone call to Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative
party chairman. It is thought the prime minister will tell the Queen of his
intentions during an audience at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday evening.
At an earlier conference in London he set out the themes of his election
manifesto, promising a programme for government which would ensure that
'welfare and wealth creation go hand in hand'.
Two opinion polls published yesterday gave Labour leads of one and three
points respectively, confirming the recent trend in its favour. That puts Mr
Major in the position of being the first prime minister for more than 40
years - since Clement Attlee in 1950 - voluntarily to call an election while
his party is behind in the opinion polls.
A Harris poll for the Observer put Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal
Democrats at 40 per cent, 39 per cent and 14 per cent respectively, while an
NOP poll for the Mail on Sunday gave them 41 per cent, 38 per cent and 16
per cent.
Despite jitters among Conservative MPs in marginal constituencies, senior
ministers said last night that there could be 'no turning back' on an April
9 poll.
One member of Mr Major's inner circle said that he was confident that the
Budget, economic competence and Mr Major's popularity would allow the
Conservatives to take the lead during the campaign.
Mr Lamont is expected to signpost a significant programme of tax reform  -
covering areas such as savings, inheritance and capital gains taxes - in an
attempt to sharpen the political contrast between the Conservatives and
Labour.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Justinian: 'Catch-all' crime to be avoided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER, QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The two jurors from the Guinness Two and Nottingham Crown Court trials who
wrote to this newspaper complaining about the legal profession's apparent
disdain for the intelligence of juries in complex fraud trials may
nevertheless welcome the authorities' search for a simpler legal process -
in particular, the suggestion for a new offence of fraud.
A general offence of fraud is unknown to English law. It is being said that
it would be helpful if there were such a crime (as there is in Scotland) to
help reduce, if not avoid, the ordeal of inordinately long fraud trials that
have scarred the criminal justice scene in recent weeks.
The idea is not new, only that it is being taken more seriously. In 1986,
the Roskill Committee, in its recommendation to substitute a professional
tribunal for jury trial in serious fraud cases, added that the issue of a
crime of fraud simpliciter should be further examined. Academic writers too
have been advocating the introduction of such a crime, either as a
widely-conceived residual offence to specific fraudulent offences, or in
substitution of the crime of conspiracy to defraud.
Conspiracy to defraud comes close to being a general offence of fraud, since
the courts have given it an extremely wide scope. The two principal
differences are that conspiracy to defraud cannot be committed by a person
acting on his or her own. Since a conspiracy is an agreement to do something
unlawful, it must not be confused with the means by which it is intended to
be carried out.
The courts have been chary of defining the offence 'to defraud', which takes
its colour from the context in which the phrase is used, and means,
ordinarily, to deprive a person dishonestly of something which is his - or
of something to which he is, would be or might be entitled, but for the
perpetration of the fraud.
The Law Commission, in its 1987 review of conspiracy to defraud, rejected
the replacement of conspiracy to defraud by a general fraud offence capable
of being committed by a single individual, largely on the ground of the
scope of such an ill-defined offence.
Most commercial activity is carried on with a view to gain for its
perpetrators, or financial prejudice to others, so that in practice the
offence would depend upon the jury's view of 'dishonesty'. Such an offence
would provide insufficient guidance in advance as to what could or could not
be lawfully done. Penal sanctions should be imposed only in clear cases. But
if a general offence of fraud were introduced simply as a long-stop, to be
used in addition to conspiracy to defraud, some of the objections would drop
away. If, moreover, the addition of a charge of fraud were controlled by the
judge in pre-trial directions, any abuse by presenters of a 'catch-all'
crime would be avoided.
Whether the general offence of fraud would significantly shorten complex
fraud trials is highly problematical. Again, the answer to that question
would depend on the definition of the crime. If it were tightly drawn, it
might limit the scope of the forensic process, but would hardly do the trick
of supplementing the existing law. If it were loosely defined, there would
be cries of uncertainty and ambiguity about lawful commercial conduct.
Some helpful guidance has just been provided by the Court of Appeal for
Jersey, in an impressive judgment under the presidency of Sir Godfray Le
Quesne QC, a former chairman of the Monopolies and Merger Commission. A
charge of 'fraud, contrary to the common law of Jersey' was upheld, the
argument focusing on whether in Jersey criminal law, largely adapted from
English statutory law, such an offence ever existed or was extant.
The accused, who was a director of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank in Jersey,
was alleged to have fraudulently induced his employer to purchase a property
in St Helier for Pounds 700,000 by withholding from the bank the facts,
known to him, that the property was offered for sale at Pounds 367,500 and
could have been bought for Pounds 310,000 or thereabouts.
The Court of Appeal came to the conclusion - not without hesitation, it was
at pains to observe - that the appellant had committed a misrepresentation,
it being that it was necessary to pay Pounds 700,000 in order to obtain the
property. It was done fraudulently. By acting fraudulently, the accused
caused actual prejudice to the bank, because it paid for the property more
than twice the sum for which it could have bought the property, and produced
a corresponding benefit to the vendors. Thus the essential features of fraud
were present.
For good measure, the Court added that the accused's conduct was a breach of
trust. The bank was entitled to rely on the accused for information about
local conditions affecting a purchase of local property. By the withholding
of important information, that trust was flagrantly abused, and it was done
in a commercial transaction in the course of the accused's duties as an
executive director.
The Court's hesitancy in upholding the conviction is expressed in language
that should serve as a warning. The Court said: 'We do not consider it
acceptable today to have a criminal offence defined in very general and
comprehensive terms and to trust that it will be confined within proper
limits by the discretion of the prosecuting officers in using it. The
citizen is entitled to clearer information than that makes possible of what
is criminal and what is innocent.' Just so.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Monday Profile: Musketeer who prefers obscurity - Mr Richard
Ryder, the government chief whip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If he appears on your television screen during the general election, it will
be no more than a fleeting glimpse. He will be at the heart of Prime
Minister John Major's campaign, but outside his constituency you will
neither see nor hear him pressing the case for a fourth Tory term.
Mr Richard Ryder is one of the most powerful figures in the Conservative
party. Quite consciously he is, and intends to remain, among the least well
known.
Mr Ryder is government chief whip. His role, simply, is that of party
manager. He is the man charged with doing the prime minister's bidding at
Westminster; the agent who ensures that the Tory troops are kept loyally in
line; and the impresario for the government's 'floor show' in the chamber of
the House of Commons. He is all of that, and then more.
In his 15 months in the job - he was one of the Treasury mafia rewarded for
his role in Mr Major's leadership bid - he has emerged as campaign
strategist, prime ministerial confidant, and cabinet fixer-in-chief. If the
Conservatives win, he could claim a prize Whitehall department. Mr Ryder
wants, instead, to stay on as chief whip.
His politics and personality are a puzzle. For all his influence, there is
only handful at Westminster that knows the man well or feels sure of his
political outlook.
The son of a country squire, a friend says he fits the Boy's Own image of an
English gentleman - 'diffident and proper, but shrewd and tough when it
matters'. He is courteous but unforgiving of disloyalty; self-deprecating
but always determined to win.
The chief whip is both liked and feared by his charges on the backbenches,
and respected by the team of a dozen junior whips. But ask one to pin a
political label on Mr Ryder and the response is a vague circumlocution
ending in the phrase: 'Well, you know I'm not quite sure.'
Mr Ryder chose long ago not to wear his brand of Conservatism on his sleeve.
Unusually in an age of pushy politicians, the adjectives most frequently
applied to him are circumspect, discreet, tactful and taciturn.
It is a mistake, however, to think that he does not have views. At barely
43, he has been in politics for nearly two decades, working for six years in
Mrs Margaret Thatcher's office before beginning a steady, if initially
unspectacular, rise through the ministerial ranks after entering parliament
in 1983.
A friend recalls Mr Ryder's bubbling enthusiasm before the 1979 general
election, when he promised that, at last, Mrs Thatcher would lead a
government that 'changes things'. A guest at a recent lunch said he was as
interesting as any on the future of a different brand of Conservatism in the
1990s.
His outlook is unconventional. He has fused an upbringing in insular, rural
Suffolk with a deep enthusiasm for the distinctly less feudal culture of
North America. The result is a political perspective not slotted easily into
traditional Tory pigeonholes.
As the MP for Mid-Norfolk he has preserved his ties with East Anglia. Yet he
is anti-establishment, disparaging the class-conscious England that others
might argue has survived longer in that part of the country than elsewhere.
A Cambridge historian, he does not blame socialism for Britain's long-term
economic decline. Instead he traces it to the cultural snobbery which led
19th-century entrepreneurs to forsake industry for the quiet gentility of
the country.
He combines his enthusiasm for the enterprise culture on the other side of
the Atlantic with more conventionally English attitudes to social welfare.
He dislikes intensely the residual racism in sections of the Conservative
party. He has a habit of reminding those who assume the superiority of
European over American culture, of the millions who were slaughtered in
Hitler's Germany.
A pragmatist rather than ideologue, his present role suits him. It is that
of the backroom mechanic and tactician, the mediator and, from time to time,
the dictator.
The chief whip is at the political centre, brokering cabinet deals before
selling them to the party at Westminster. But the slight figure with an
almost schoolboyish appearance is never called from his privileged seat on
the government front bench to speak at the Commons Despatch Box. As chief
whip he can cite tradition when he politely declines requests for newspaper
interviews.
His style is that of his political master. He is ready to listen carefully
to the concerns of jittery MPs. But once his mind is made up, he demands
absolute loyalty. As one charge puts it: 'He has a light touch . . . most of
the time.' A senior colleague is less tactful: 'He is the toughest of us
all.'
When Mr Ryder took over the whips' office in November 1990, the party's MPs
were in disarray.
They had just ousted their leader. They were bitterly divided over Europe
and were more than half-convinced that they were about to lose the general
election. They had chosen as prime minister a man from the back streets of
Brixton in south London, with a fraction more than three years' experience
in the cabinet.
Mr Ryder was even less well known. A former junior whip, under-secretary at
agriculture and middle-ranking Treasury minister, his principal claim to
fame was some skilful public presentation during a scare about salmonella in
eggs.
At the Treasury he is remembered as sharp and insightful, although one
mandarin says: 'He hardly made an impact on economic policy.' He did,
though, cement his friendship with Mr John Major, another East Anglian MP
with whom he had shared a spell in the whips' office.
Few, therefore, were surprised when Mr Ryder was given the task of healing
the party's self-inflicted wounds and reuniting it behind the new prime
minister.
Less that 18 months on, the government backbenches are scarcely
recognisable. They are still prone to the occasional bout of jitters.
Resentments burn among the old guard over the way in which their former
leader was dumped. But the blind panic that engulfed Mrs Thatcher has been
replaced by carefully organised calm.
The poll tax, the flagship of the third term, was sunk with barely a ripple.
The scores of MPs whose antipathy towards Europe once threatened to tear the
party apart were reduced by the time of December's Maastricht summit to an
isolated handful of diehards. Mr Major's consensual style was vital, but Mr
Ryder still gets much credit for transforming a rabble into something akin
to the old Tory party.
It took time and energy. In spite of bouts of ill health he works
ferociously hard. From a spacious but spartan room adjoining the members'
lobby of the Commons and from the rather more grand surroundings of Number
12 Downing Street he typically works 15 hours or more a day. His private
passions - modern painting, jazz and Ipswich football club - have been put
temporarily on one side.
Like most of life's natural 'fixers' Mr Ryder puts a premium on organisation
and on personal contact. His formal lines of communication are supplemented
by a personal network of friends and agents. At weekends, he spends much of
his time on the telephone.
He is the founder of the now famous 'four musketeers', the small Downing
Street group which has spent most of the past year planning Mr Major's
election campaign.
It was Mr Ryder who first detected the dangerous drift into which the
government slipped early last summer. He suggested regular meetings to
integrate the party's control of the Whitehall machine with the political
imperative of winning the election. Ministers, he told friends, needed to be
reminded that they were politicians as well as policymakers.
Since then he has been joined by Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, Mr
John Wakeham, the minister charged with government presentation, and Mr John
MacGregor, the leader of the House of Commons, for daily breakfast meetings
at Number 12.
More recently, he has synchronised the Conservative onslaught against Labour
with the government's control of the parliamentary timetable. It has been no
accident that the party's daily press conferences attacking opposition
policies have coincided with Westminster debates on the same themes.
As a friend puts it: 'He is more determined than any of us that we are going
to win.' So during the election campaign proper he will spend most of his
time at Conservative Central Office: fixing, calming nerves, knocking heads
together - and keeping out of camera shot.

FT  09 MAR 92 / The past is not what it used to be
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's budget prospect has inspired too many commentators to take a
hike down memory lane. Memories or histories of the Bretton Woods system, of
the last great debt deflation 60 years ago, of past electoral bribes that
were taken or refused, or of rectitude rewarded or rebuffed, are mis-cited
in support of every conceivable strategy, as the writers suppose. Every
strategy, in fact, except the one or two which actually worked - but we will
come to that later.
For example, here we are back with demand management, to the horror of the
few remaining monetarists. That, as they explain, is what comes of operating
in a fixed exchange rate system, where you lose monetary sovereignty. That
is true as far as it goes, but then that is not very far. The similarity -
that an exchange rate commitment tends to run your monetary policy - looks
striking, but the differences are bigger.
For a start, a system of (possibly temporary) currency blocs is quite unlike
the Bretton Woods system. That looked, while it lasted, more durable than
the gold standard; exchange rate crises were quite rare and very well
flagged. The ERM still looks tentative and the commitment to it a matter of
political expediency. So there is a currency risk premium on interest rates,
even - at the moment - in Germany. The result is recession in most member
states, most of the time. On the other hand, the old system depended for its
stability on controls on capital movements, so the exchange markets were
dominated by current account flows, and chancellors worried about little
else.
Today, their main worry is the possible effect of any dash for freedom on
financial market confidence. They have, in a sense, more freedom than their
predecessors in the 1960s. They also have bigger temptations, given the
deflationary club they have joined, and run bigger, more unpredictable
risks. I doubt that hindsight about the hyper-responsibility of Mr Roy
Jenkins or the irresponsibility of Mr Reginald Maudling proves anything
except that the commentator is probably getting on a bit. My own guess would
be that the markets will allow Mr Lamont considerably less freedom than the
supposedly Draconian IMF would have done in the old days.
This is one reason why a growing group on the right, including the
monetarists but also some Maudling nostalgics, wants us to escape the market
constraints by leaving the ERM. But here there is a useful parallel in
living memory; indeed a cautionary tale. Mr Anthony Barber thought he could
get away with a huge monetary stimulus because Britain had left the ERM Mark
I, known as the Snake. That was a devaluation greeted at the time as a dash
for freedom. Those recommending just the same dash now ought to mention this
health warning.
There is still one respectable-looking argument for recommending desperate
remedies. That is the belief that we are not back in the irksome disciplines
of Bretton Woods, but in the threatening depression of the 1930s. The story
sounds a bit the same - a downward slide punctuated with optimistic
forecasts, a stock market which fell in a series of small crashes separated
by nostalgic bull phases and an economy riddled with debt. For example, Mr
Peter Warburton has recently reminded us that private debt has tripled as a
proportion of British GNP in the last four decades, to reach a level only
exceeded - and that but briefly - in the early 1930s. It all looks very
telling, unless you remember what the 1930s were actually like.
That was the time when cash was king, so that you could pick up Chippendale
chairs for what would be, say, Pounds 20 in today's money. It was a time
when willing borrowers were so hard to find that the government could get
away with refinancing the National Debt at half the then going long rate
because investors had nowhere else to turn. It was also the period when the
Bank of England adopted an official anti-competition policy, godparenting
the formation of cartels and of groupings such as ICI simply to preserve
some sort of corporate sector.
It is not wholly impossible we are heading back to such an era; that, after
all, is the Rees-Mogg thesis. But if we are, it is clear we still have a
very long way to go. Meanwhile the rapidly strengthening recovery in the US
economy, despite fiscal paralysis, a discredited president and deepening
recession in most trading partners, suggests spontaneous recovery is still
possible from today's debt burden. This burden was, you should remember,
built up over years, and mainly to finance consumption and investment,
rather than in a brief speculative orgy. All it takes is a sensible cut in
interest rates.
Could we do as well here? Inside the ERM, it depends partly on the German
sense of timing, but not entirely. Our own Treasury seems to have learned
too much from the false parallel with Bretton Woods and been too timorous
about interest rates. Bigger cuts might certainly have scared off some bank
funds. Remember the Gnomes of Zurich? Not if you are young enough to trade
these days, but the memory seems to be alive and nightmarish in Great George
Street. What has changed from the past is that a cut big enough to help the
economy would certainly have boosted the stock market, and so attracted
longer-term funds. That is why the dollar has been rising ever since it
became clear that the Fed's rate cuts were working.
So what advice is there for Mr Lamont? The situation suggests the oldest and
usually the best advice - make a confident speech, and sit down.
Unfortunately, he has devalued confident speeches. He might be tempted by
the example of the 1930s to do what worked for Britain then and the US this
time, and devalue, but the Barber memory is too recent. Or he could do a
Roosevelt, and pay for high public investment from, higher taxes. But that
sounds like Labour. How nice not to be Mr Lamont.

FT  09 MAR 92 / 'Big bang' BR sale dropped: Denationalisation of the
railways could stretch into the next decade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS have formally agreed to abandon plans to privatise British Rail in
one 'big bang' within the lifetime of the next parliament.
Instead, the Conservative party election manifesto will pave the way for a
creeping denationalisation of the railways which could stretch beyond the
end of the decade.
The turnabout appears to have resulted from a recognition of the
overwhelming practical difficulties facing any of the suggested options for
breaking up BR and selling it outright.
It is likely to be seen as a victory for Sir Bob Reid, whose short career as
BR's chairman had seemed destined to culminate in the break-up and abolition
of the corporation within the next five years.
It will also feed the belief among some observers that privatisation plans
have been undermined by a reluctance among Department of Transport officials
to see their power base eroded.
Under the new plan, privatisation - or denationalisation, as transport
ministers are now calling it - will be a gradual process. The first step
will be to remove BR's statutory monopoly and open the tracks to anyone who
wants to operate trains. This will mean setting up a regulatory authority to
ensure all operators have equal access to tracks and stations.
The next step will be to sell Railfreight, BR's freight division, to the
private sector. This can be done quickly because the division has good
profits potential and its trains do not carry voters.
Finally, the government will seek a slow and cautious transfer of BR's
passenger services - but not its tracks - to the private sector.
Services, or groups of services, which deliver returns high enough to
satisfy the private sector could be sold outright. Loss-making but socially
necessary services could be franchised out to operators requiring the lowest
subsidies.
Eventually, when all Britain's train services are being operated by the
private sector, BR could be left as a residuary body, owning just the
tracks. But the scale of investment needed to bring some services to
profitability means this stage is unlikely to be reached until well into the
next decade.
A high priority for ministers has been the need to allay voters' fears that
a 'big bang' privatisation could mean higher fares and service cuts.
The plans appear to differ markedly from those Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the
transport secretary, advocated last year, but Mr Rifkind has thrown his
weight behind them, letting it be known that he is 'delighted'.

FT  09 MAR 92 / 'Archaic' annual Budget attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S annual Budget should be scrapped and replaced with a more
considered system of formulating fiscal policy, according to Sir Douglas
Wass, a former permanent secretary at the Treasury.
In comments shortly before tomorrow's Budget statement, Sir Douglas said the
Treasury's 'archaic' secrecy in preparing for it was unnecessary and reduced
the possibilities of a public debate about tax policy and the workings of
the economy.
His comments will add to the disquiet about the Budget process expressed by
some MPs, former government officials and people in financial markets.
Sir Douglas was the longest-serving Treasury permanent secretary since the
1950s, having held this job between 1974 and 1983. He served under two
chancellors, Labour's Mr Denis Healey and the Conservative, Sir Geoffrey
Howe.
He is now chairman of Nomura International, the European arm of the Japanese
securities house.
Sir Douglas is unconnected to any political party. But his proposals come
close to official thinking by Labour, which wants to improve on the Budget
process by publishing an annual UK economic assessment which would link
government spending and income.
Sir Douglas said the Treasury should open up the process of making economic
forecasts, possibly by handing this job to an independent body outside
Whitehall. The forecasts are published twice a year, in the Budget and in
the Treasury's Autumn Statement on public spending.
Reducing secrecy over official forecasts would strengthen public confidence
that Treasury projections were being made on purely economic grounds, and
not tinged by political bias.
Sir Douglas said the Budget speech, which the chancellor normally gives in
March, should be replaced by two discussion documents or green papers, to be
published in October and January.
The first of these would be a draft Finance Bill which would deal with
relatively non-controversial aspects of tax-collection such as changes in
tax law in specific sectors.
The second green paper would be a broader planning exercise - linked to the
Autumn Statement - which would match up government spending commitments with
likely revenues.
The Treasury would publish a draft of its tax proposals, so it could be
studied ahead of enactment by a Commons select committee.
Notification of possible tax changes in advance would have an
'imperceptible' effect on people's behaviour. According to Sir Douglas,
other countries publish their tax proposals 'without provoking economic
breakdown'.

<TEXT>
Richard Lines, chairman of the acquisitive specialty chemical company MTM,
seems to be under an unusual amount of pressure of late. First his
well-connected company upsets the stock market by revealing that it is
having difficulty getting its auditors to sign off the accounts. Then he
resigns as chairman of the board of governors of Teesside Polytechnic.
The energetic Lines, who since 1979 has been MTM's driving force, had thrown
himself wholeheartedly into his Polytechnic role, even giving Pounds 100,000
of his own money to found three academic chairs to strengthen its research.
As chairman he helped the Poly win the go-ahead for a new University College
on Teesside together with Durham University and the Teesside Development
Corporation. MTM says Lines had been considering resigning from the Poly
board for some time, and the two events are unrelated.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Observer: Lindi's broadcast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It sounds as if there is a little disagreement behind the cameras about the
content of what could be Britain's most exciting party political broadcast
this year.
If Lindi St Clair, founder of Britain's Corrective Party, can raise a
minimum 50 candidates willing to stand in the election, her party will
qualify for an election broadcast. St Clair envisages a broadcast replete
with brothel scenes - featuring 'lots of condoms, disinfectant and clean
sheets' - to lend credence to her main policy idea - legalising
prostitution. 'The clean side of a brothel has never been shown on the
media,' she says.
That is not quite what the BBC has in mind. Margaret Douglas, the Beeb's
chief political adviser, was thinking more in terms of producing something
similar to the swansong put out recently by the now defunct SDP.
That broadcast, featuring the twin talking heads of John Cartwright and
Rosie Barnes - the two remaining SDP MPs, was by common consent among the
dullest of recent times. It would be a supreme test of even the former Miss
Whiplash's daunting communications skills to make such a format interesting.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It's over four months since Robert Maxwell died but bizarre anecdotes about
the man continue to surface in odd places.
The latest, recounted in a review of Tom Bower's Maxwell biography in the
Times Literary Supplement, could have come straight out of a film script
about Harry Lime's post-war underworld.
Maxwell had invited Rodney Leach, a Rothschild banker, to visit him alone at
Headington Hall. 'Alarmed by the underworld tales which had come to my ears
about his years in the Berlin Control Commission, I agreed to the visit on
one condition, that telephone calls would be put through to the house at
specified times, and if I did not reply the caller would summon the police,'
writes Leach.
Maxwell showed not a flicker , he seemed to view my precautions with some
respect, as evidence that I had at least an inkling of the realities of
life,' says Leach who now sits on the Jardine Matheson board.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How time flies. Remember a punk band from the late 1970s called the Sex
Pistols? Didn't EMI sign up the group and then drop them after the group had
released only one record because it was worried about the bad publicity? And
didn't Richard Branson's Virgin records then release their album, Never Mind
the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, which contained a track called EMI?
It was not a flattering little ditty and ended with a loud raspberry.
Presumably, Thorn EMI now owns the rights to the company song.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Observer: Strange taste
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea that Warren Buffett, the canny American investor, has suddenly
found a taste for the shares of Guinness, Britain's sixth biggest company,
is a bit hard to swallow. True, Buffett likes to take big stakes in solid
brand names and has done very well by investing in that other well-known
drinks company, Coca-Cola.
But Buffett tends to invest in famous names when they are down on their
luck. Witness his current love-affair with Salomon. Guinness, by contrast,
has been outperforming the market for years and is selling on 18 times
earnings. It is hard to see how it can perform much better.
If Buffett really has a big stake in Guinness - one per cent would be worth
over Pounds 100m - perhaps he should be thinking of lightening his load,
rather than adding to it?

Perhaps City villains should take a tip from the world's drug traffickers.
If you have to get arrested and thrown in jail, Zurich is the place to have
it happen.
The prisons are nice, and you get paid Pounds 7.60 a day net for your
labours. South American drug-mules love it, it seems, because they can make
more money there than at home. With an average sentence of 38 months, they
can stash away a nifty Pounds 8,850. Moreover, they can ship it home without
hindrance because Swiss law forbids anyone to make a claim on the money.
All this, plus the cost of prosecution which is paid by the state, has been
getting on the nerves of Marcel Bebie, public prosecutor in the district of
Bulach which, being adjacent to Zurich airport, has to handle all the mules
caught on their way to the city's big drug market. Bebie suggests the level
of jail pay should be related to the cost of living in the criminal's
country.
Then only the Japanese would want to come.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Mountain to climb: Peace for Nagorno-Karabakh is seemingly
out of reach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Making nations is an ugly matter, especially when they are being formed from
the ruins of totalitarianism.
In Azerbaijan now, the republic's national leaders are jockeying for power
in the wake of the resignation on Friday of President Ayaz Mutalibov. While
this is going on, people are gorging themselves on details of real and
alleged atrocities perpetrated by Armenian irregulars in their enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh against Azeri towns and villages on its south-east corner.
These reports of atrocities, which have a hard core of truth however much
they are inflated, have made a fraught situation apparently insoluble.
Nagorno-Karabakh is taking its place among the world's apparently unsolvable
ethnic territorial disputes. This sliver of mountainous ('nagorno')
territory has been home to Armenians for centuries. Given semi-autonomous
status in 1923, it has long been regarded by Azeri nationalists as an
affront to their national integrity. Since 1988, it has been the focus of a
distrust of Moscow in the popular fronts of both Armenia and Azerbaijan.
President Levan Ter Petrosian of Armenia was a leading member of the
Karabakh Committee, which was the nucleus of the Armenian independence
movement. President Mutalibov of Azerbaijan has just fallen because he could
not protect his people in the Azeri towns within the enclave. Karabakh is at
the heart of the two new nations' politics, and positions on both sides have
grown increasingly rigid.
The town of Agdam, near the Nagorno-Karabakh border in Azerbaijan, is now a
site of muted horror. It lives under the shadow of the massacre at the Azeri
village of Khodjaly on February 25 and 26, when - from the survivors'
account - Armenian guerrillas fell upon the town, and massacred a refugee
column fleeing towards Agdam. The low claims on the Azeri side are of around
1,200 dead; neutral observers say about 200.
On the streets of Abdam there are groups - hundreds strong - of refugees. In
the local hospital, practically devoid of equipment, five people lie in bed
in the tiny, foetid wards; when the bandages are unwrapped from their feet
they reveal suppurating toes and soles, the flesh having been eaten away.
The story told by one of them, Ms Aina Gasanov, 50 but looking 70, is that
they fled to the woods from Khodjaly on the night of February 25 and were
there until found last Saturday - 11 days and nights, lightly clad in
sub-zero temperatures, eating only snow. There had been, she said, 200 of
them: half had died, some were still there. A young doctor standing by said
that all the survivors would undergo amputation.
There is little sign of damage in the town itself. I saw three sites where
rockets, said to be of the Krystal type, had fallen: one had come down
outside a partly built bungalow, the fragments making a hole in the roof
below which slept two infants (who were unhurt). We were told six such
rockets had fallen on Saturday night.
The front line is now on the Karabakh border, a few kilometres up the road
from Agdam. Near the village of Sheli the Azeris have established a post
with two rusting 150mm Pushka cannon. One was pushed to the brow of a hill
overlooking a valley in which lies the town of Afkeran, formerly Azeri and
now held by the Armenians. There were two forward Azeri positions beyond,
each with half a dozen men. That appeared to be the strength of the Azeris
in the field yesterday.
One man at the Sheli post said that one of the cannons worked, another said
that neither did: in any event, there was one shell. A little further away
in the valley, automatic fire crackled sporadically, interspersed with booms
from Armenian guns in or near Afkeran. Azeris warned of snipers, but no fire
was directed at the post when we were there.
However, it had come under fire while host to a Grad rocket launcher,
according to a television reporter who had filmed it. The Azeris, who
continually complain of relative weakness in the face of Armenian strength,
have one or two Grads and some tanks and armoured personnel carriers.
If anything is clear in this muddy, partisan struggle it is that the
Armenians are trying to clear the Azeris out of Karabakh and secure their
borders. The front line post at Sheli is on the border; Askeran just inside.
Shusha, a little further in, is still held by the Azeris but surrounded by
Armenians, and we were told that helicopter flights had stopped.
In clearing the area, the Armenians have laid what presently seem to be the
indestructible foundations of Azeri hatred, and appear to have put any kind
of peace out of reach.
The reverses suffered by the Azeris have fed their way quickly into national
politics. President Mutalibov, a former first secretary of the Azeri
Communist Party who rushed through presidential elections last September in
the wake of the August putsch, had tried to retain vestigial links with the
former Soviet Union, agreeing to membership of the Commonwealth of
Independent States and delaying the creation of a national army and
currency.
He had survived in the clannish politics of Baku, the state capital, by
co-opting some opposition figures into power - thus he had hoped to avoid
the fate of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the former Georgian president, who
excluded to his cost a widening circle of the opposition.
It seems, however, that Mr Mutalibov was unable to quash the cabals. His
ambitious prime minister, Mr Gasan Gasanov, had put lines out to the
opposition and when, last Thursday and Friday, thousands surrounded the
Azeri Supreme Soviet in protest, he turned on the president and helped to
bring about his fall.
'Even if another takes my place, you will not be able to solve the Karabakh
problem,' said Mr Mutalibov before he went. But those now calling for a
change in policy think they can.
Dr Tevfik Gasimov, a senior member of the Supreme Soviet's National Council,
which now exercises effective power, said at the weekend: 'We want
Azerbaijan to be a democratic unified state. We will have no autonomous
regions; these are a left-over of Soviet imperial days when they used one
nation to control another. The Armenians in Karabakh will be equal before
the law with every other citizen.'
Dr Gasimov said that the first priorities were to form a national army of
between 20,000 and 30,000 men, 10,000 of whom would be used to seal off the
borders and airspace of Azerbaijan, preventing equipment and soldiers being
flown in to Karabakh. He - and others - made much of the size and efficiency
of the military forces on the Armenian side, saying that the local forces
were augmented by professional fighters from Syria and Lebanon, where there
are substantial Armenian minorities.
A Lebanese film-maker in Agdam confirmed part of this, saying that the rich
Dashnak (Armenian) community in his country was providing funds for arms and
men to help their kin in Karabakh.
The area has already played a role far beyond its size: in stimulating the
national movement in Armenia, Karabakh lit a torch round the former Soviet
Union - one still flaring in Azerbaijan.
Furthermore, it is one example of a host of similar cases. All over the
former union are autonomous regions of differing statuses - many within the
Russian republic itself, which is home to several different peoples.
The groups of politicians in Baku who claim the right to destroy these
autonomies in the name of the equal rule of law are parallelled in other
republican capitals - including Moscow and Kiev.
They claim such regions are relics of Stalinism and so, in a sense, they
are. But the fact is that the people in them cling to their autonomous
status, or seek to become fully independent, through fear or a resurgent
sense of nationalism. This will hardly go away without further - perhaps a
great deal of - bloodshed, if no mechanism can be found to untangle these
knots.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Arts: My Fair Lady - The Opera House, Manchester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This new production of My Fair Lady is well timed, has already been
extensively hyped and is likely now to visit London.
There has been some brouhaha over whether or when national press would be
invited to review these Manchester performances - and therefore over whether
Mancunians were being given merely a preview or rehearsal run. Frankly, a
lot more rehearsal and revision would have helped. There are at present just
three good reasons to catch it: Helen Hobson, the fresh new Eliza; the
elegant and original sets by David Fielding; and My Fair Lady itself.
The last is the most important. Most of the brilliant dialogue is straight
out of Shaw's Pygmalion, and yet the song lyrics prove just as memorable.
This is something rare in musicals, but rarer yet by far is the fact that
the songs are made buoyant less by Lerner's words than by Loewe's music.
(Even Higgins's Sprechgesang is, or should be, intensely musical.)
But I could not write this way if this production were my first experience
of My Fair Lady. The lyrics are under-inflected, some performers are
under-voiced and over-amplified, several parts are miscast, and neither
Eliza nor Higgins emerges as a star role.
Helen Hobson does everything well, has enough voice for it all and
exaggerates nothing. She has timing, feeling and fun. But she is as yet only
half the Eliza she could be, and for this and much else, Simon Callow, the
director, is to blame. She never, for example, learns to carry or turn her
head elegantly or expressively. (Several of the other, more experienced
actors don't even seem to know how to use their eyes.)
Edward Fox makes a nonsense of Higgins by blurring his consonants, drawling
his vowels (he calls them 'vahls'), and dawdling behind the music. He works
his six facial expressions for maximum contrast, but none of them conveys
intelligence. When he says 'I have my own spark of divine fire' ('fah'),
no-one believes him. He takes Eliza to a place which he calls 'Airscot' and
which Michael Medwin's atrocious Pickering calls 'Ashcot'. What kind of
phonetics do these two club bores know?
There are minor signs that Callow has tried to 'reconceive' this beloved
show, not very revealingly. Mrs Pearce (Jennie Goosens) has become Irish,
and Mrs Higgins (Sheila Burrell) is now a Bohemian artist. Jasper Conran,
the designer, has made the Embassy Ball a dingy, vulgar affair - horridly
choreographed by Quinny Sacks - in which Eliza's simple white neo-Grecian
gown is a breath of fresh air; the idea doesn't come off. Wittier is his
Ascot, with all the ladies dressed like stems and wearing huge flower hats;
Eliza, as an all-pink rose, really is the purest and loveliest here.
David Fielding's non-realist designs would not surprise an opera audience.
In a musical, they are a shock. The basic white set, with columns and walls
in classical English architectural style, is printed all over with words
from Shaw's ideal phonetic language (for example, 'laeqgwej'). He always
makes much of Shaw's dominant symbols: most wittily in the Covent Garden
scenes, where the old fruit and vegetable market stands right before the
distant and tilted Opera House. 'Laeqgwej' is what will take Eliza from the
former to the latter.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Management: Japan is the catalyst for conversion -
Transformation in working practices at the Unipart motor components group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A more unlikely location for a Japanese-inspired revolution in working
practices is hard to imagine: a cluster of run-down industrial buildings in
the back streets of Coventry, surrounded by terraced housing little changed
since the 1950s.
Three years ago, the plant was churning out replacement engines for its
owner, Unipart, Rover Group's former parts and accessories division, in
dingy surroundings and a sour industrial atmosphere.
Today, using the newest, specialised manufacturing equipment from Japan and
the latest in worker and management practices, it is out to become a 'world
class' maker of components.
The plant, whose brightly lit and clinically clean interior contrasts
starkly with the dowdy exterior, is still a Unipart subsidiary.
But it is now the home of Premier Exhaust Systems, which will be opened
formally today by Peter Lilley, the industry secretary.
It is seen by John Neill, the chief executive of the Unipart Group of
Companies (UGC), as a model for the other companies in the group.
It is producing exhaust systems and preparing for large-scale production of
catalytic converters for both the resurgent Rover and Rover's Japanese
partner, Honda, whose own 100,000 cars-a-year UK plant comes on stream at
Swindon in October.
In recent months, Neill's conviction that Japanese attitudes and work
practices needed to be instilled throughout UGC has begun to be put into
striking effect.
In a move unthinkable a couple of years ago, Unipart is ending recognition
of unions for all 4,000 workers, who are acquiring staff status.
'Clocking in' is out. Japanese-style team working is being introduced and
old, hierarchical structures dismantled. Responsibility for quality is
falling on individuals. Salaries are being linked to performance.
Nowhere are the changes being felt more keenly than at Oxford Automotive
Components (OAC), whose Oxford and Kidlington-based parts making activities
have formed the largest part of Unipart Industries.
Honda was an obvious potential customer for Unipart components. Originally,
Honda said Unipart's proposed prices for fuel tank supplies were too
expensive but nevertheless awarded it the business, along with an
introduction to Yachiyo Kogyo, its tank supplier in Japan.
Subsequently, Yachiyo supplied Unipart with the equipment to make the tanks,
sent a team of engineers to Oxford to help install it and - pre-dating the
Premier operation by nearly two years - trained OAC's operators for six
weeks on its own lines in Japan.
Mark Trevelyn, one of the trainees - who has gone from shop floor operator
to group team leader - says it 'came as a surprise to hear the Japanese talk
of 'our company', not the management's'.
The whole team, he says, came away with strong impressions - among them an
unfamiliar and overwhelming stress on quality, and the rebukes that flowed
from producing rejects and ignoring paperwork.
suppliers harbour deep suspicions about the long-term intentions of the
Japanese car makers in Europe, and their true willingness to expand parts
sourcing from indigenous suppliers.
Neill will have none of it. As an example of the Japanese desire for
long-term 'partnership' commitments, he says that Honda plans progressively
to rely on Unipart for its exhaust emissions research and development
programmes in Europe.
He says he is not worried that there is no agreement down on paper, nor that
there are no formal guarantees. 'It's all based on mutual trust.'
But the links with Honda were not forged without some disillusioning days.
Unipart executives came away from one visit with 20 pages of problems with
their products.
Some of the rejections might have mystified European vehicle makers.
'For instance,' recalls Neill, 'they wouldn't tolerate weld splatter on a
silencer, even though it has no bearing whatsoever on the part's
performance. A western company simply wouldn't care and would probably
claim, when the parts were rejected, that it was all part of a hidden agenda
for the Japanese trying not to do business with the west.'
The Premier plant, in which Unipart has invested several million pounds, is
already turning over Pounds 15m a year.
It does not go in for pre-shift calisthenics. But the Japanese influence is
immediately obvious in the state-of-the art production equipment and the de
rigueur company 'uniform' worn by all 175 employees.
All employees have staff status. There is no privileged parking,
differentiated canteens or washrooms.
Remuneration is knowledge-based, linked to a star rating system as operators
acquire the ability to operate more machines and sustain quality standards.
The maximum is five stars and, says Neill, 'the idea is that every employee
should be a five-star operator'.
There are no supervisors, only leaders of small, flexible teams. Anyone can
stop the production line if they think quality is under threat. In terms of
management, says Frank Burns, managing director of the Coventry venture, who
joined Unipart four years ago, 'there is simplicity in everything: one layer
of 10 managers, then the shop floor'.
The search for continuous improvement encouraged in all employees has
resulted, says Burns, in exhaust output now requiring less than half the
space of a conventional assembly line.
In recruiting Premier's work-force, its management placed flexibility above
work experience.
As a result, says Burns, 'we have ended up with people who had little or no
factory experience'.
The price of this approach - extended training - is one Premier has
willingly paid for what it says is an exceptionally enthusiastic work-force.
The plant operates contribution circles - different from quality circles in
that they were designed to reflect the heritage and culture of UGC. They can
be initiated by management or employees but the latter is heavily favoured.
Contribution circles have now been running for about nine months at Unipart.
With more than 80 operating, savings of Pounds 1.8m have already been
achieved, according to Neill.
Burns himself recalls earmarking Pounds 300,000 for new process machinery, a
decision that was abandoned after shop floor workers adapted existing
machinery. Peer pressure is claimed to be keeping absenteeism down to under
2 per cent.
Several years into their relationship, Honda has now nominated Unipart as
its 'model supplier' in Europe, and is using it as the example of progress
in its training brochures outside Japan.
'What we liked about Honda,' recalls Neill, 'is that they made clear that
initially they wanted not so much technical ability, but the right attitude
and commitment. When we got the business, we knew they had a lower quote
from elsewhere.'
Now, says Neill, 'I go once a year to see Honda in Japan to maintain our
good relationship and say 'We promised to do things, we've done them - now
what can we do for the future?''
The deepening relationship, says Neill, means that 'we don't have to look at
a one-year horizon. We can make capital and people investments, and we've
now got young engineers we are training so that we can provide them (Honda
and Rover) with high-quality research and development and production
expertise.
'If all their Japanese suppliers work in that climate, is it any wonder the
Japanese are winning?' ponders Neill. 'They eliminate all useless argument,
instead putting all their efforts into improving. This is so much more
efficient than the west, it's hard to see how western companies can catch
up.'
It is what he regards as a remorseless pursuit of perfection by the Japanese
which makes the task for western producers so hard: 'You have to be
personally offended by producing a product which is not perfect. Japanese
people get emotionally upset; so far, the Brits mostly don't,' says Neill.

FT  09 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Businesslike talk from union's new
leader - Bill Morris, who takes over the top TGWU job today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORDS could come from a business leader: 'I am the chief executive of an
organisation which will see Pounds 60m come in this year and that does not
include investments. We employ more than 1,000 people. I'll have a fleet of
over 400 cars and 126 properties on the books.'
The speaker is Mr Bill Morris, who today takes over the top job at the TGWU
general workers' union, Britain's largest union.
He is explaining why he and other officials are about to embark on a series
of training courses to help them manage their resources better. They will
need them.
Mr Morris takes over as general secretary at a low point in the union's
history. For nearly a decade its effectiveness has been constrained by
political infighting, its administration fund is likely to show a Pounds 12m
deficit for last year and its membership is declining rapidly.
The TGWU has prided itself on being Britain's largest union for more than 60
years. It will almost certainly lose the title next year, as three
public-sector unions, Nalgo, Nupe and Cohse, combine their 1.4m members.
Other unions could soon overtake the 1.2m-strong TGWU in size and further
diminish its influence.
In spite of the problems Mr Morris, previously deputy general secretary,
starts off with goodwill from all sides of the union.
His predecessor, Mr Ron Todd, was personally popular but was never able to
shrug off the effects of two bitterly fought elections for the job in the
mid-1980s. The right wing, grouped around Mr George Wright, his opponent in
the election for general secretary, considered him too heavily influenced by
the broad-left faction which has dominated the executive in recent years.
Like Mr Todd, Mr Morris was the broad-left candidate for general secretary
and, like him, he beat Mr Wright. But his opponents in that election seem to
have forgiven him, for the moment at least.
One union regional secretary said: 'The atmosphere has changed. Bill is his
own man. He is getting round the union far more than Ron did. He talks to us
and he takes our opinions into account.'
Such benign views may become less common later this spring when Klein &amp; Co,
a consultancy, produces a report on the union's structure and Mr Morris acts
on it. The findings are almost certain to lead to an attempt to erode some
power bases.
Virtually everyone in the union agrees that its structure causes it to pull
in different directions. The power bases include the policy-making national
executive, a lay body dominated by the left, and the 11 regional
secretaries, who are paid officials mainly identified with the right. In
addition there are 14 national trade groups, each with its own officers. The
result is a profusion of command centres.
The need to rationalise them has been accentuated by the union's financial
problems. Mr Morris denies that the union is in financial crisis. The asset
base is strong, he says, and the union is on target to balance income and
outgoings this year, following 250 job cuts and a rise in subscription fees.
In addition Mr Morris is shaking up what is widely viewed as an
extraordinarily sleepy financial culture at the TGWU. One departmental head
explains: 'We ask for money when we need it and, providing we do not make
outrageous demands, we get it. It is a crazy system and we recognise it has
to change.'
Mr Morris will introduce budgets and plans thorough checks of whether the
services it buys in, such as legal services, provide value for money.
Better management will lead to savings, but the union will need plenty of
those to cope with declining membership. Since the Tories came to power in
1979 the TGWU's membership has shrunk by half, whereas the average union
decline is about 30 per cent. Its strength is in traditional industries,
which are declining, and it has failed to get a strong foothold in
technology-based or service sectors.
Mr Morris plans recruitment campaigns and aims to increase the union's
attractions with such measures as free skill-assessment for workers made
redundant and free consultancy for workers, such as milk deliverers, who
become self-employed. Mr Morris also points out that a Labour election
victory would ease the membership problems.
'Even if they did nothing to encourage recruitment through legislation, just
creating a new climate would change things. The aggressive behaviour of a
number of employers would not continue.'
But even if Labour won, the party would not help it more than other unions,
which have shown themselves more adept at holding on to members. And the new
large unions created by mergers will provide more effective competition than
smaller organisations.
If the TGWU is to retain its influence it must seek mergers with other
unions, something at which it has not been successful in recent years. Talks
with the National Union of Mineworkers are stalled, possibly terminally, and
other unions looking for partners are put off by the TGWU's structure and
financial problems.
One possibility is a merger with the GMB, Britain's second-largest union and
a traditional rival with a broad industrial base similar to the TGWU's. Mr
Morris agrees there is industrial logic in amalgamation but says no talks
are in progress.
He will no doubt be strongly tempted to get negotiations under way with the
GMB - and other large unions still seeking mergers - as the pace of mergers
among unions quickens and the dangers grow of the TGWU being left
permanently on the sidelines of power and influence.

FT  09 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): FT survey of Tecs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN opinion survey of Training and Enterprise Council directors is being
carried out by the Financial Times.
Early response to the survey has been strong, with nearly 300 Tec directors
already having responded. The closing date is today, but after requests from
Tec directors we have made arrangements to be able to include returns made
by March 13.
The survey aims to establish Tec directors' views on the effectiveness of
the councils, their structure, purpose and funding.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING work by English Estates, the government property developer, has
begun on three factories intended to help offset the effect of 'peace
dividend' job cuts on Barrow-in-Furness.
The Cumbrian town needs to diversify its economy to cope with the loss of up
to 7,000 jobs between 1990 and 1995 from its main employer VSEL, builder of
the Trident submarine.

<TEXT>
NSK, the Japanese bearings manufacturer, intends to extend this year's
Easter and August holidays at its biggest plant in Peterlee, Co Durham, in
order to cope without job losses with the effects of low levels of orders.
The company is negotiating with the AEU engineering workers' union to
lengthen the Easter holiday by eight days and the summer break by five.
The proposals affect the 578 hourly-paid employees.

FT  09 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Oil and gas output expected to rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRODUCTION of UK oil and gas is expected to rise steadily over the coming
years before peaking later in the decade, according to the latest forecast
from the Petroleum Services Group at Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm.
The firm predicts that oil output will rise to 2.1m barrels a day this year
from 1.9m last year, reaching a peak of 2.7m b/d in 1995. The previous peak
was 2.5m b/d in 1986.
The firm predicts that gas output, which reached 5.2bn cubic feet a day last
year, will rise steadily to a peak of 8.9bn cu ft in 1998.

FT  09 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Scepticism reported on redress
payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMERS of government agencies appear to be unconvinced of the merits of
compensation payments when service falls below standard, John Willman
writes.
Such redress systems are at the centre of the government's Citizen's
Charter, but people would prefer agencies to 'get it right first time', says
a report published by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm.
Response speed and reliability were rated as the most important priorities
in the surveys by which many agencies measure customer satisfaction. Methods
of redress were rated least important behind staff courtesy and the
condition of public areas. The report was based on interviews with chief
executives of 42 of the 57 agencies established to improve government
services.
Unsuitable staff and shortage of financial resources were cited as the most
common obstacles to providing better service.

FT  09 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Unions set to agree changes at Rover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS AT the Rover vehicle group are likely to recommend proposals for
Japanese-style changes in working practices to their 30,000 members at the
company after talks with management.
The company said last week that, after more than five months of negotiations
between management and unions, the talks had been successfully concluded.
Representatives of the AEU engineering workers' and TGWU general workers'
unions on the joint negotiating committee at Rover are likely to pave the
way today for the main proposals. The union will then call a meeting of
delegates from all sites to consider the proposals, which will later be
presented to the workforce for a ballot.
Mr John Allen, the AEU's chief Rover negotiator, said yesterday that the
deal would 'strengthen the future viability of Rover'.
The agreement is designed to help the company meet increasing competition
from Japanese car plants in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Much of the
proposed plan is based on Japanese working methods.
The package, which would increase job security for workers by removing the
threat of compulsory redundancies, would eliminate nearly all shopfloor
demarcation lines and clear the way for flexible team working.
The measures would create a single-status company by ending all remaining
distinctions been staff and hourly-paid workers, including ending
clocking-on arrangements for manual workers.

FT  09 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Tecs fear cuts in YT funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRITICISM of government proposals to cut budgets forYouth Training, the main
training scheme for young people, is mounting among Training and Enterprise
Councils which administer the scheme.
Mr Dick Curry, chief executive of Oldham Tec, whose YT budget is likely to
be cut by 9 per cent, said: 'It is disappointing that after such a short
life Tecs are suffering cuts at a time when jobs for young people and the
unemployed are not available.'
Last week a confidential minute of a meeting between Mr Michael Howard,
employment secretary, and members of the group of Tec chairmen who represent
the movement to the government, disclosed criticism of proposed government
funding of YT.
The minute said the 'very low' offers of funding for YT places had led to
the belief that government was deliberately underfunding Tecs.
Mr Curry said, that with high unemployment rates in the south of England,
funding was being diverted to Tecs in the south.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary said unemployment was rising
everywhere and it could not be right to reduce funding in the north because
of problems in the south.

FT  09 MAR 92 / FT Satellite Monitor: Cricket helps to boost dish
installations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAHAM GOOCH and the England cricket team have boosted the sales of
satellite television dishes, according to the latest FT Satellite Monitor.
Sales of new dishes were 78,000 last month, compared with 41,000 in the same
month last year.
Mr John Clemens, chairman of Continental Research which produces the
Monitor, attributes at least part of the growth to the fact that Sky Sport
bought the exclusive rights to the cricket world cup. Sky Sport is one of
the six channels broadcast by British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite
television network in which Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times has a
stake.
Mr Clemens said yesterday: 'Ever since England beat India in the first match
on February 22, installation has grown dramatically.' In the first two weeks
of February new rentals and sales of dishes were 15,000 a week. By the last
week of the month the figure had risen to 26,000.
The availability of cricket increased dish sales among the over-45s and the
AB social group of managers and professionals - groups which were less
likely in the past to install satellite television.
The 78,000 installations last month brings the total of satellite dishes in
Britain to 2.27m, or 10 per cent of all homes. A further 266,000 say they
will definitely get a satellite dish and a further 1.77m say they probably
will.
In the first week of the cricket, Sky Sport was the most used satellite
channel by men, with a 7 per cent share of the audience in satellite homes.
Satellite television is achieving a 26 per cent share of viewing in homes
where it is available, compared with the total for the BBC of 29.7 per cent.

FT  09 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): 'Mismatch' found between jobs and
training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GAP between jobs advertised in London and what people are being trained to
do is identified in a survey published today.
The Labour-dominated Association of London Authorities examined 15,711 jobs
advertised in newspapers and Jobcentres in a sample week in February, and
compared them with 6,429 training places provided by Youth Training and
Employment Training, the scheme for long-term unemployed adults.
The association used National Vocational Qualification levels to compare
jobs available with training places. It says in its report that most
trainees achieve NVQ level 2, yet most jobs available are at the lower NVQ
level 1 or the higher NVQ level 3.
In addition it says there is a discrepancy between the types of jobs
advertised and training courses. For example, fewer than 1 per cent of jobs
available involved motor repair and maintenance, but 18 per cent of YT
trainees were on such courses. More than 7 per cent of jobs available were
in catering, but only 1.1 per cent of YT and 1.4 per cent of trainees on ET
were taking catering courses.
Ms Margaret Hodge, leader of the association, said there was a serious
mismatch between the standards achieved by trainees on the main schemes and
many of the jobs available.

FT  09 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Call to reform race discrimination
laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEEPING REFORMS are needed to make race discrimination laws effective,
according to government research. Existing laws are so heavily weighted
against victims that the vast majority of offences go unpunished, according
to a study published today.
The Commission for Racial Equality has argued for some years that reform is
needed, but the government has said it considers existing laws to be
adequate. Today's report was compiled by the University of Southampton for
the Department of Employment.
It says employers should be required by law to take steps to ensure ethnic
minorities are recruited and promoted. 'Class actions', along the lines of
the US system, should be introduced which would allow cases to be brought on
behalf of groups in society. The study argues that the commission should
also be given greater powers of investigation.
While Britain's race laws are among the most extensive in the European
Community, the study says victims of discrimination are 'discouraged by
every step' of the legal process. Emotional stress and fear of victimisation
'act as further disincentives'.
The study concludes that in spite of considerable legal and practical
measures the evidence shows 'the vast majority of instances of
discrimination are untested and go unpunished under the current
arrangements'.

FT  09 MAR 92 / ITV seeks changes in EC directive on fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITV companies have launched a campaign to win changes in a proposed
European Community directive which they fear could affect co-production
funds and lead to the renegotiation of thousands of performers' contracts.
The proposed directive would base payments to performers when a work was
exploited in other markets, such as video rental and cable and satellite
television, on 'an adequate proportion of income'.
Mr Mike Chattin, ITV's industrial relations adviser, said yesterday the
directive would have a serious effect on international co-productions.
ITV said investors would not put money in productions 'if they did not know
that they were purchasing full rights, free of any obligations to artists
for the areas covered'.
There are fears that the new obligations would put European television
producers at a disadvantage compared with US and Australian programme
makers.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Team close to finding asthma gene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCIENTISTS in Oxford are close to identifying a single defective gene which
triggers several common allergic disorders including asthma, hay fever and
eczema.
The discovery could lead to a cure for a group of diseases that kills 2,000
people a year in the UK and affects millions more.
The researchers, led by Dr William Cookson and Dr John Hopkin at the John
Radcliffe and Churchill hospitals, are thought to be within months of
finding the defective gene, which is carried by at least a quarter of the
population.
Once the gene is known the pharmaceutical industry can start to develop a
drug to block the protein it produces. This would cure the conditions it
causes.
Dr Hopkin warned last night against excessive optimism. 'It's likely to be
10 to 15 years before our research leads to a drug on the market,' he said.
The Oxford team has been funded by medical charities, the Wellcome Trust and
the National Asthma Campaign.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Transport system in chaos, say architects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S architects say that the country faces a severe housing crisis and
that its transport system is in chaos.
The Royal Institute of British Architects today urges changes in government
policies on housing, transport and the environment. 'The housing needs of
many members of society are not being met,' it says.
The paper says public expenditure on housing has fallen 60 per cent in real
terms over the past 10 years. Local authority house-building has fallen from
86,000 units in 1980 to 13,000 units last year. Housing associations built
17,000 houses last year compared with 21,000 in 1980.
It calls for a national housing policy to establish the extent of housing
shortages, the areas where new housing is required, and the type of housing
needed.
Local authorities should be allowed to spend a far greater proportion of
capital receipts from the sale of housing and land on building new homes,
the institute says.
Leading financial institutions should be encouraged to play a part in the
private-rented sector.
'Adequate standards of housing for all sectors of the community are an
essential human right,' the institute's paper continues. 'It should not be
left to the market to determine the nation's housing mix on the basis of the
best possible return on site value.'
The paper says that a balance must be struck within the next generation
between private and public transport, and road and rail. 'More road building
is not the solution to the problem of traffic in town and cities,' it says.
Without efficient public transport towns and cities will be condemned to
terminal decline.'
Some further selective investment will be needed in motorways and trunk
roads but there is no case for introducing toll roads, it argues.
Railways are the most effective means of mass transportation and a target
should be set for the transfer of freight from road to rail, the paper says.
But more public investment and subsidy will be needed to maintain and
improve rail services. 'Privatisation will not ensure an improved railway
network.'

FT  09 MAR 92 / Budget '92: Men in raincoats ready to stop Treasury leaks -
Elaborate measures to safeguard secrets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A cold blustery day in March 1984 a young Treasury economist travelling
to work on the Tube found a seat, sat down and unfolded that day's copy of
The Guardian.
His heart stopped. Splashed across the front page was the headline 'Lawson
plans tax shake-up for Budget'.
As one of the three working closest to that year's Budget proposals in the
Treasury he knew he would be under suspicion for leaking the information to
the press. Sure enough, on arrival at Whitehall his boss closed and locked
the office door behind him.
'The chancellor has blown a gasket,' he said. The Special Branch was
downstairs.
The 1984 Budget leak was a blatant breach of Budget purdah - a blanket ban
on Treasury officials and MPs talking to the press in the three months
before the Budget.
Journalists, economists, lobbyists and non-Treasury MPs hate purdah, but the
Treasury's defence is that it safeguards the right of parliament to hear new
policies first and prevents sensitive financial material reaching
unscrupulous ears. The material leaked in 1984 included a forecast of the
ending of tax relief on life assurance. There was a run on policies to beat
the Budget.
No one was ever caught for the 1984 leak, and the matter was dropped, but
only after the officials involved had been interrogated at length. The young
economist, who left the Treasury several years ago, was positively vetted
all over again - a long process, particularly in 1984 when it apparently
took some effort to prove his Liverpudlian aunt was not involved with the
Militant hard left.
To many, this zealous approach to guarding the Budget's secrets looks
antiquated and undemocratic. Some economists, including ex-Treasury
officials, argue that purdah shields Budget decisions from open debate.
One former Treasury official said: 'The Budget has become more like the Paul
Daniels magic show than the rational debate it should be. An open debate on
the policy options would lead to some better decisions being made.'
In the 1988 Budget Mr Nigel Lawson decided to restrict mortgage tax relief
to Pounds 30,000 per property regardless of the number of borrowers, and to
delay its implementation for six months. The effect was to trigger a rush by
individuals clubbing together to buy houses and a rapid increase in prices.
The former official said: 'It would have been absolutely obvious at the
time, had he spoken to some of the practitioners, that this would create an
enormous bubble in the market for a six month period.'
The promise exacted from Treasury MPs and officials to lock papers up and
not reveal details to journalists is no longer considered sufficient. In its
strictest form purdah dictates that those in the know avoid lunches or even
casual encounters with reporters.
As the Treasury says: 'Simple experience shows that the only way to avoid
getting drawn into territory where you are revealing Budget information is
by not talking about it.'
Anyone suspected of talking about it - or worse, slipping copies of Budget
proposals into an unmarked brown envelope - can expect a visit by a man in a
raincoat from the Ministry of Defence across the road.
In the past few years spectacular leaks have been rare, but the Treasury's
unyielding stance is the product of a long tradition of Budget leaks.
In 1936 Mr Jimmy Thomas, the colonial secretary, resigned when he was blamed
for leaking details of an increase in the import duty on tea before the
Budget. A number of his friends had made a killing at Lloyd's by placing
insurance with Lloyd's against the increase.
Hugh Dalton, who was chancellor in 1947, was another purdah casualty. As he
was entering the chamber on Budget day he told the lobby correspondent of
the Star what the rise in cigarette duty was to be. The Star was on the
stands with the news by 3.45, before the chancellor had even risen to make
his speech. Dalton resigned soon after.
Today, the two dozen or so on the 'Budget list' - those privy to the entire
Budget process - enter purdah with a locking box and a safe in which to
store the crucial papers. Only secretaries that are 'Budget-cleared' can
look at the papers with Budget List Only scrawled diagonally in large red
letters across the page.
Documents are sealed in two envelopes to ensure that holding the paper up to
the light would be a waste of time. The paper on which the proposals are
printed is designed to photocopy badly.
Telephone calls and chance encounters at the bus stop are also logged.
Officials even have to contend with unannounced 'raids' by security guards
carrying out spot checks to make sure a paper is where is is supposed to be
at any given time.
'If you can't produce it that instant you are in trouble,' said a Treasury
adviser.
Those in purdah also have to produce a list of all the people with whom they
have had contact at weekends and evenings. One official had to report daily
contact with his wife, who happened to be a journalist.
All this makes one wonder when the chancellor and his team find time, in
between logging, filing, recording, locking and unlocking safes, to do any
work. One who experienced purdah for several years said: 'It is a great
inconvenience and serves no purpose.'

FT  09 MAR 92 / Fear for jobs 'likely to offset' tax-cut boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RISING unemployment and falling house prices are likely to offset any
positive effect on consumer confidence of a 1p cut in the basic rate of
income tax in tomorrow's Budget, according to PA Cambridge Economic
Consultants
The private-sector economic research company said its latest quarterly
survey of consumer trends, which was completed on March 1, shows that
conditions for sus-tained consumption growth in Britain have not
materia-lised.
The consultants said fears of rising unemployment were likely to cause
consumers to postpone spending decisions in spite of the widely expected cut
in the basic rate of income tax from 25 per cent.
According to the survey of 1,000 consumers 37 per cent do not believe the
worst of the recession will be over until unemployment peaks, while 57 per
cent believe it will take at least a further six months for the recession to
bottom out.
The consultants' overall consumer confidence index, which takes employment
prospects, the financial situation of households and confidence in the
government into account, rose slightly to 87.3 in March from 85.1 in
December. But it was below the 93.8 and 92.2 levels of last September and
March respectively.
The consultants' index of consumption activity, which measures current
consumption of a range of goods, fell from 100.9 in December to 93.8 this
month, its lowest level since the index was first compiled in March last
year.
While the consultants' latest poll of consumers offers no comfort for the
government, Infolink, a credit information group, believes that demand for
consumer credit is showing some signs of recovery.
Infolink's figures, which are based on the number of credit checks by
lenders, suggested that the retail sector experienced a 9.7 per cent
increase in credit demand in January compared with January last year.
Demand for credit from Infolink's clients among specialist home loans
companies, finance houses and in the new car loans sector, was lower than in
January last year, but compared with recent months, Infolink detected a
'tentative upward trend' in credit demand.
Mr Brian Bailey, Infolink's chairman, said: 'Whilst spending confidence is
still low, it appears that the beginnings of a gradual economic recovery
could be around the corner.'
He said the company would need February's figures before making a more
confident prediction.
THE chancellor may be disappointed if he is counting on tax cuts in this
week's Budget to fuel a strong recovery in high-street spending, according
to a survey.
Asked what they would do if they received a cash windfall such as a tax
rebate, 37 per cent of consumers said they would take a holiday, while 14
per cent said they would pay off debts.
Only a third said they would use the money to buy clothes or home
furnishings.
The survey, conducted by Gallup for IPC Magazines in the middle of last
month, found that half of consumers saw no end to the recession, while a
third said it would last at least another year.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Devolution may cloud Lib Dems' message
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGE in Britain's political system and economic revival were set at the
centre of Liberal Democrat aspirations for the general election yesterday by
Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader. But he risked clouding his party's message
with a complex stance on the issue of 'home rule' for Scotland.
'Never before has the ground for political change been so well prepared,' he
said at his party's spring conference in Glasgow.
On the economy, he warned that 'the Tories offer paralysis and Labour offer
timidity'. He called for more public investment and an independent central
bank, and hinted that he would reverse any tax cuts in tomorrow's Budget.
He welcomed the possibility that steps towards proportional representation
might appear in the Labour manifesto. But he urged the party to go farther,
'bite the bullet' and come out unequivocally in favour of reform.
In spite of the obvious passion of Liberal Democrats at Glasgow for Scottish
'home rule', the party's MPs have agreed it must be subordinate to Mr
Ashdown's top priority - electoral reform at Westminster. Some MPs have had
to be persuaded to toe the line, notably Sir David Steel, the former Liberal
party leader who made only a brief appearance at the conference. With
devolution bounding up the Scottish political agenda, the strength of the
deal to subordinate Scottish aspirations has been tested to the limit. Mr
Malcolm Bruce, Scottish spokesman, admitted the party was only 'half way'
towards persuading voters to accept why Scotland would not have a guarantee
of its rights under a devolved system until Britain had a fair and
representative democracy.
Mr Ashdown knows the Liberal Democrats' appeal has to be broadly based if he
is to make an impact in the constituencies in southern England from which
the Liberal Democrats were forged - came second to the Tories in 1987.
Scottish 'home rule' is far down the list of voters' priorities in Liberal
Democrat target seats such as Bath, Falmouth and Camborne, Richmond and
Barnes, or Cheltenham. Mr Ashdown's tactics for capturing such seats are
based on simple messages about changing the Westminster political system and
on disenchantment with 'negative' Labour and Tory campaigning.
The Liberal Democrats' slogan My Vote, splashed across a giant orange sun
above the conference platform, is aimed at encouraging voters to make every
ballot paper count. Party political broadcasts will list all the 259
constituencies where the Liberal Democrat is the main challenger to the MP.
'Ours will be the vote which breaks the logjam holding back change in our
country . . . My vote is for an election which is positive,' read the
introduction to Mr Ashdown's speech.
That message will be emphasised at grassroots level with Liberal Democrat
policy papers crammed with neat ideas or 'common sense' solutions to
contemporary issues - such as the housing shortage or animal rights - that
can be niche-marketed according to local concerns.
Party headquarters in Westminster is lean and professional - a remarkable
turnround compared with the near-bankrupt state of the organisation a few
years ago.
But the lesson of past elections is that Liberal Democrat victories are born
largely of local effort.
Party strategists believe a coalition government is a long way down the
scale of probabilities. They fully expect Labour or the Tories to attempt to
run a minority government before calling Mr Ashdown.
Liberal Democrat MPs in Scotland feel joy at the way in which the 'home
rule' dream that drove many of them into politics could soon start to become
reality. Their delight could threaten the party's cohesion if Mr Ashdown
sought to vote down a minority government offering devolution, but not full
constitutional reform.
A substantial minority of Scottish companies expect constitutional change in
Scotland after the general election, even though a majority expect the
election will be won by the Conservative party, which opposes constitutional
change, James Buxton writes.
Two thirds of Scottish companies expect the Tories to win the election,
according to a survey by BBC Scotland and Pannell Kerr Forster, the
accountancy firm.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Price cuts 'fail clothes shops'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recent unprecedented level of price-cutting among mass clothing
retailers has largely failed to stimulate enough additional sales to prevent
a severe erosion of margins, according to a report from Verdict, the retail
consultants.
Verdict estimates that between November and January clothing retailers on
average sacrificed 20 per cent of their gross margin by marking down prices.
Clothing retailers typically achieve gross margins of 50 per cent.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Warning over 'underclass'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSISTENT long-term unemployment presents the risk of a permanent
'underclass' developing in Britain and imposing serious strains on social,
political and civil order, a Policy Studies Institute report warns today.
The future of the underclass, says the report, depends mainly on the future
of employment. To prevent a permanent underclass forming there must be
effective policies for reducing and changing the distribution of
unemployment, or a change in the social structure so that employment was no
longer the source of money and everything else that society regarded as
valuable.

THE Post Office will this week enter the National Health Service computer

Since April 1990 the Post Office's computer operations have functioned as a
separate business, selling services to other Post Office divisions. Now
computer services managers can offer services to other public-sector bodies
and overseas post offices. Their first such service, a hospital information
support system, is to to be launched today. Such systems record all
information about a patient's visit to hospital, from treatment to costs.

FT  09 MAR 92 / BBC drops Panorama broadcast on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC last night denied that political pressure lay behind a decision to
drop at the last moment tonight's planned Panorama television programme on
the economy, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The programme by Mr Peter Jay, the BBC's economics editor, would have looked
at how well the Thatcher economic revolution had survived the recession and
the extent to which present difficulties were due to errors by Mr Nigel
Lawson, the former chancellor.
At the weekend Mr Samir Shah, editor of weekly news and current affairs
television, decided that the programme was too backward-looking. Tonight's
Panorama will instead look at how the UK can escape from recession. Some
elements of Mr Jay's film may be included together with a studio discussion.
A BBC spokesman said last night that the unusual decision to drop or change
a programme so late in the day was 'absolutely utterly not a political
issue'.
Some BBC current affairs staff last night questioned the view that an
interview with Mr Lawson was too backward-looking when yesterday both the
Walden programme on ITV and BBC's On The Record explored the origins of the
recession and links with the Lawson era.

FT  09 MAR 92 / TUC blames 'short-term' culture for industry's ills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURERS will have to abandon the short-term culture that has
characterised their post-war development if Britain is to build a new
generation of world-class companies, according to a study by the Trades
Union Congress.
The study, which will form the centrepiece of a conference in London today,
says British industry's preoccupation with short-term returns is one of the
fundamental reasons why it has failed to compete with other countries that
belong to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
According to a TUC 'checklist for action' the challenge for industry is 'not
simply to develop companies which provide high dividends for their
shareholders in the short-term; it is also to create an envir-onment in
which firms are encouraged to pursue long-term approaches to investment and
innovation, and therefore to contribute to the high-pay, high-productivity
economy that trade unions seek'.
The TUC says a consensus between employers and unions, led by the
government, is necessary to restore Britain's manufacturing competitiveness.
The government, it says, has the primary role in developing a strategic view
of industrial priorities, identifying the key objectives for industry.
The study concludes that the government should create the correct framework
for company law and practice to encourage a longer-term corporate
perspective. Takeover and merger policy should minimise short-term pressures
while rules on share dealing and accounting should encourage a longer-term
view of investment by capital markets.
The TUC says companies must invest more in skills through company-based
training and retraining. British businesses plan to raise spending on
innovation this year, according to a survey by the Confederation of British
Industry and National Westminster Bank.
The survey, conducted among more than 300 companies, shows that 43 per cent
of companies expect to step up spending on innovation - including research
and development of products and processes, market research and joint
ventures with overseas companies. Only 15 per cent said they intended to cut
innovation expenditure this year.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Blunkett condemns 'flaws' in council grants system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR David Blunkett, Labour spokesman on local government, said yesterday that
recent government figures on council spending showed 'yet another
fundamental flaw in the government's system of standard spending
assessments'. The assessments are used to estimate how much councils need to
spend on the services they provide.
The party said the figures showed that some councils were gaining government
grant from the way in which the central grant system took account of the
cost of servicing council debt. Discrepancies occur because grant is
distributed according to notional rather than actual debt for each council.
The total for capital financing, however, is based on the total actually
spent. The current rules on taking account of capital financing mean
Tory-controlled Westminster, for example, benefits by almost Pounds 100 per
poll-tax payer and Labour Lewisham by more than Pounds 50 a head. Tory
Huntingdon loses by slightly more than Pounds 45 a head, as does Labour
Thurrock.
Labour said yesterday that it would make the discrepancy a priority in an
urgent review of spending assessments.
Its reform of the grant system would add new factors to the assessments.
They would include factors such as unemployment rates, mortality rates and
total disposable income.
Mr Michael Portillo, minister for local government, defended the system,
saying: 'If you base grant on actual debt charges you reward overspending
and penalise prudent authorities.'
Labour says the debt was 'government-sanctioned' because councils were not
prevented from borrowing above credit approval limits. Ministers argue that
authorities should not be 'bailed out' for choosing to incur larger debts.
Labour estimates that its planned changes would eventually mean a shift in
grant away from shire districts and towards urban areas. The possibility of
assessing social need differently in London from the rest of the country
could mean that the effect of the changes was less straightforward in the
capital. Reforms would almost certainly be phased in, perhaps with a 'safety
net' preventing an authority losing more than a set proportion of its grant
in a single year. The first changes would be made in time for determining
grant in 1993-94.
In a few key areas, such as provision for the under-fives, Labour would
consider withholding grant unless councils actually provided a minimum
service. While the Tories say this amounts to more central control, Labour
compares it with the government's use of grants for specific purposes only.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Recovery put at heart of Tory election strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INTENSE campaign to persuade voters that a fourth Conservative term is a
prere-quisite for the economy's emergence from recession has been put at the
centre of Mr John Major's general election strategy.
As the prime minister trailed his manifesto at a weekend conference of party
activists he stressed that the promised economic recovery depended on a
Conservative victory. Among the pledges in the manifesto will be a fresh
drive to regenerate the inner cities.
His comments coincided with a signal from Mr Michael Heseltine, the
environment secretary, that the Tories will make maximum capital during the
campaign out of the past and present links of Labour MPs with leftwing
causes.
Mr Heseltine, a member of the government's election 'A-Team', said the
Conservatives would emphasise repeatedly that any parliamentary majority
secured by Mr Neil Kinnock would leave the Labour leader 'totally dependent
on his party's extremist wing'.
Since the start of the year Mr Major has been blaming the length of the
recession on the world economic downturn. Senior colleagues said that
approach had been judged a success. The aim now was to combine the voters'
awareness of the worsening international outlook with a perception that the
upturn in Britain was being delayed also by political uncertainty.
Mr Major told the party's weekend local government conference that a
Conservative victory was 'crucial' because: 'Britain is ready to come out of
recession - and only a Conservative government can safely bring it out.'
The prime minister added: 'What the country needs now, above all, is
confidence . . . and if confidence in business is to grow, there's nothing
that will make it grow faster than a Conservative victory at the general
election.'
That theme will be echoed throughout the four-week campaign proper which Mr
Major is expected to launch when he asks the Queen to dissolve parliament
after tomorrow's Budget. It will be used to answer Opposition charges that
the government miscalculated the depth and duration of the recession and to
move on to the offensive against Labour.
A succession of senior ministers warned at the weekend that Labour's
'high-tax, high-spending, high-inflation' policies would wreck any prospect
of an economic upturn.
Mr Major confirmed that opportunity, choice, ownership and individual
responsibility would be the principal themes underlying the manifesto which
the Conservatives plan to publish early next week.
He was joined by colleagues in emphasising that a commitment to improved
public services would also be writ large in the Conservative prospectus.
Mr Heseltine promised a large-scale initiative to bring together public and
private finance to regenerate inner cities. His comments suggest that, after
a difficult battle with cabinet colleagues, he has won the prime minister's
approval to extend greatly the present City Challenge programme.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Labour raises stakes on constitutional reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR will today seek to broaden its constitutional debate and will include
in it proportional representation, which will be crucial in the event of a
hung parliament.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, will spell out the
need for a new constitutional settlement between the individual, the
community and the government.
As proportional representation is again highlighted as a way in which Labour
could attract support away from the Liberal Democrats, Mr Brown will make
the case for a broader constitutional agenda. This would include freedom of
information, devolution, moves towards a written constitution and the
concept of economic rights.
In the first of a series of lectures organised by Charter 88, the
constitutional reform movement, Mr Brown is expected to argue that the
post-war settlement did not take account of government itself as a vested
interest from which the citizen might need protection. While Mrs Thatcher in
1979 represented some attempt to redress the balance, she did so by denying
the existence of community altogether.
Mr Brown will say that constitutional change 'is not incidental but integral
to our future as a country. It is not a sideshow at the election but centre
stage'.
Labour yesterday played down the prospect of a potentially divisive
manifesto commitment to proportional representation for parliamentary
elections. Party officials said the manifesto would not offer a royal
commission or Speaker's conference, but would promise the enhancement of the
work of the committee on electoral reform chaired by Professor Raymond
Plant.
Mr Robin Cook, the shadow health secretary and a supporter of electoral
reform, said yesterday: 'The Plant committee's work will continue in
government and of course it will be a much more powerful and influential
body then because it will not be a sub-committee of an opposition, it will
be a committee, a strengthened committee, reporting to a government with
power to act.'
Labour, which is slightly ahead of the Tories according to the opinion
polls, is confident that the Budget, which will dominate this week, will
have little effect on voting.
The party believes that its 'borrowing to bribe' campaign during the past
few weeks has neutralised the effect of any tax cuts, while a package of
measures intended to bring about recovery will, it argues, enable it to
claim that it has won the argument.
Three of Labour's senior performers will lead the attack in the first few
days after the election is expected to have been called.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the party leader, will speak at the Scottish Labour
conference on Friday. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, and Mr Roy
Hattersley, the party's deputy leader, will speak at the party's London
conference next weekend.
Today Mr Cook will highlight the clear choice between the 'bribe' of tax
cuts and more spending on health care.
In an interview on TV-am yesterday he sought to keep up the pressure on the
government over the health service, with renewed claims that it was harder
for doctors to use clinical judgment because they were being pressed to use
commercial judgment.

FT  09 MAR 92 / National housing bank proposals published
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR HAS published its plans for a national housing bank to increase the
supply of homes for rent without adding directly to government spending.
The bank would borrow money on the capital markets and lend it to local
authorities and housing associations to build and renovate rented housing.
Private landlords could also be given access to funds for rented
accommodation, provided they observed tenants' rights and kept the housing
in good repair. Finance could be offered to housebuilders to support social
housing in mixed developments to foster balanced communities.
The bank would be established as a public limited company so that it could
be set up relatively quickly. Its borrowing would thus not be included in
the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), and would be free of
Treasury restrictions. The bank would offer a way of recycling local
authority capital receipts back into housing without adding to the PSBR.
At present, spending these receipts counts towards the PSBR, and councils
can plough back only a proportion of the money into housing. Money invested
in the national housing bank would not count as part of the PSBR, even if it
were spent on housing.
The plans are likely to be welcomed by those who believe that the level of
building for rent needs to be increased substantially.
The scheme has been welcomed by builders' representatives. Mr John Smith,
chairman of the Building Employers' Federation, said: 'Something of this
sort already exists in one or two European countries. Anything which can
increase the flow of housing finance without adding to inflation must be
welcome'.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Taxes, public indebtedness and democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIZE and role of the public sector is a hot political topic across the
world. In the US, George Bush is in trouble with some republicans for
raising taxes to cut the deficit; in the UK, the question is not whether to
borrow, but instead whether a higher deficit should fund tax cuts or public
investment; while in Italy, almost every politician would like to cut
government borrowing, yet no politician is able to do so.
International comparisons of public spending and taxation are increasingly
creeping into these national political debates. This is particularly true in
Europe, because of the pressure to harmonise national tax systems and the
limits on public deficits and debt contained in the Maastricht treaty. This
week's special table provides an overview of the activities of the public
sector in each of the six largest industrialised economies over the past
twenty years. All figures are expressed as a percentage of gross domestic
product and refer to 'general government', which consists of central
government, state, regional and local authorities and the social security
system.
Europe is the continent of big government, although the public sector has
grown everywhere over the past 20 years. In 1990, total government
expenditure accounted for 37 per cent of GDP in the US and 31 per cent in
Japan but over 50 per cent in both France and Italy. The UK remains
somewhere in between, with a lower ratio of government spending to GDP than
its continental European partners and less public investment than any
country, except the US. European countries have also tended to rely more on
indirect taxes, particularly value-added tax, and on social security taxes
than either the US or Japan.
Reducing the size of the public sector has been a persistent theme of recent
OECD economic reports. Public sector deficits grew rapidly in the first half
of the 1980s, while rising government debt and higher real interest rates
increased the burden of interest payments. But until the current economic
downturn, the primary budget, excluding debt interest payments, of these
countries, except Italy, had moved back into surplus.
Nevertheless, the bulk of the fiscal retrenchment among OECD countries has
come about through higher taxes, rather than lower spending. Of the 1.4
percentage point fall between 1984 and 1990 in the average deficit-to-GDP
ratio, revenues accounted for 0.9 percentage points and expenditures for
only 0.5 percentage points. France, Germany and the UK are exceptions to
this rule.
Not all OECD countries have brought their deficits and debt under control.
Italy, Greece and the Netherlands, in particular, have had persistent
primary budget deficits and high and rising net debt ratios. Their shared
problem, according to a recent economic policy paper, lies not in the
structure of their economies but in their constitutions.
All three countries are what the authors term representational parliamentary
democracies, with five or more representatives per electoral district. These
countries have tended to have shorter-lived governments and more coalition
governments than either majoritarian parliamentary democracies with fewer
representatives per district, or presidential democracies, where the
executive is more independent of the legislature.
Indeed all those OECD countries which have seemingly unsustainable levels of
public debt are representational democracies, save for Ireland and Portugal;
and all the representational democracies, save for Denmark, have
unsustainable fiscal policies. Representational democracies have, on
average, had higher budget deficits over the past forty years, as the chart
shows.
Governments do not, it seems, deliberately accumulate debt with which to
burden their successors. It is countries with short-lived, minority
governments, and not those with regular changes of majority government, that
have tended to accumulate public debt. Weak governments, unable to take
necessary decisions to cut spending or raise taxes, fall back on borrowing
instead.
All of which suggests that Italy, the home of the minority government, may
need to reform its constitution if it is to reduce its outstanding gross
debt ratio to 60 per cent of GDP and so qualify for Emu. Proportional
representation may be theoretically appealing; but too much PR can bring
troublesome side-effects.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Mandela and Botha play their referendum cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH African National Congress President Nelson Mandela and former President
PW Botha made strong interventions yesterday in the run-up to next week's
whites-only referendum on ending apartheid, the former appealing for strong
'yes' vote and the other saying approval would mean suicide for the
Afrikaner people.
Neither, however, will have helped the cause of President FW de Klerk, who
has staked his political future on achieving a landslide 'yes' vote in the
March 17 referendum.
Mr Mandela's plea, carried in the mass circulation Sunday Times newspaper,
was aimed at white members of the ANC, who are very few in number. But the
ultra-right Conservative Party can use his message of support as proof that
he and Mr de Klerk are in alliance together - a charge which the
Conservatives have exploited to frighten whites.
At a weekend Conservative Party rally, one poster showed Mr de Klerk as a
tiny figure begging at the knee of Mr Mandela, with the slogan 'No to
Mandela and his Klerk.'
Mr Mandela yesterday promised a political system 'in which all the country's
inhabitants feel secure'. But he warned that a 'no' vote would be read as a
declaration of war by blacks, adding 'if the hopes of the majority of South
Africans. . . are once more thwarted, the stress and upheavals of the past
will be like a game of marbles.'
Mr Botha's call for a 'no' vote will also bolster the Conservative campaign.
He told a weekend newspaper that a 'yes' vote would lead to a government
dominated by the ANC and its close ally, the South African Communist Party.
Ironically, it was Mr Botha who initiated the political reforms pursued so
dramatically by Mr de Klerk. But the two have often quarrelled since Mr
Botha resigned as President in August 1989.
The threat of a Communist takeover was also raised by right-wing parties at
their weekend rally, with Mr Eugene Terre'blanche, the most powerful orator
of the right, claiming that the referendum was a choice between 'God and the
communists.' However the rally, organised by the Conservative Party, the
neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement) and
the Herstigte Nasionale Party (Reconstituted National Party) was clearly a
disappointment to the organisers.
They had predicted tens of thousands would attend, but only around 3,000
people turned up, some dressed in the khaki uniform of the Afrikaner
Resistance Movement. Right-wing leaders opened the rally by galloping into
Pretoria's Church Square on horseback, though paramilitary leader Eugene
Terre'blanche fell from his horse during the procession.
Meanwhile Mr de Klerk outlined his 'bottom line' demands for a new political
system, saying these included a free market economic system, measures to
prevent the domination of minorities and ensure that 'standards' are
maintained in white areas, effective protection for private property, job
and pension security for white civil servants, devolution of power, an
impartial security service and traditional liberal protections such as a
bill of rights and independent judiciary.

FT  09 MAR 92 / China to start HK consultations with UK today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QIAN QICHEN, China's foreign minister, holds talks today in London with the
British government as part of a consultation process over Hong Kong
established when Mr John Major, the prime minister, visited Beijing last
September to sign an agreement on the territory's new airport, writes
Alexander Nicoll, Asia editor.
Britain and China agreed on six-monthly meetings at foreign secretary level
in order to head off misunderstandings such as the dispute over the airport.
China will assume sovereignty over the British colony in 1997.
As well as meeting Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, Qian will see Mr
Major and two of his Conservative predecessors, Mr Edward Heath and Mrs
Margaret Thatcher, and Mr Gerald Kaufman, Labour's foreign affairs
spokesman.
Mr Major is expected to raise human rights as well as arms control and
issues of common interest to the two countries as permanent members of the
UN Security Council, including the progress of the Cambodian peace process.
During his Beijing visit, Mr Major said he would take a personal interest in
Mr Hurd's discussions on human rights with Qian.
He said Britain intended to maintain 'unrelenting and unremitting' pressure
to win the release of political dissidents and other detainees, and
presented Li Peng, China's prime minister, with a list of individual cases.
In their talks on Hong Kong, Mr Hurd and Qian are expected to discuss the
promotion of investment, a new air service agreement, arrangements for a
British consulate-general in Hong Kong, Vietnamese boat people, and the work
of the Joint Liaison Group which maps out the detailed arrangements for Hong
Kong's future.
Mr Hurd is not expected to discuss with Qian two issues of burning interest
in Hong Kong: the governorship and the speed of the introduction of
democratic processes.
Lord Wilson, present governor, is to retire this year and London is expected
to appoint his successor, likely to be the last UK-appointed governor, after
the elections. The government is unlikely to consult Beijing on the
appointment.
Mr Hurd has said that he would raise with China the question of accelerating
the pace of democratic reform in Hong Kong beyond that already agreed with
Beijing. However, he is understood to believe that the time is not yet ripe
to do so.
The Chinese government rules out a revision of Hong Kong's Basic Law to
accommodate a larger number of directly elected seats on the Legislative
Council.

MR Pierre Beregovoy, French finance minister, said yesterday that Mr
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the ultra-right leader, posed a threat to democracy and
likened his rise to that of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, Reuter
reports from Paris.
'We must realise that Le Pen's ideas threaten to be fatal for democracy. All
democrats . . . must clearly say 'Never, never will we ally ourselves with
Le Pen',' Mr Beregovoy told French television.
'I am among those who as an adolescent lived through the events of 1939 to
1945.
'I knew how Hitler and Mussolini took power, by flirting with the most
perverse elements of human consciousness,' he said.
The Socialists, expected to take a battering in regional elections on March
22, have made the fight against Mr Le Pen's National Front one of the
central themes of their campaign.
On Friday, left-wing demonstrators hurled petrol bombs at National Front's
Rouen headquarters.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Buchanan still poses threat to Bush bandwagon: President
adds South Carolina to tally of primaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush has added another state to his tally of primaries with
a convincing victory in South Carolina, but was again unable to quash
completely the challenge of Mr Patrick Buchanan, his right-wing opponent.
Bush campaign managers said his 67 per cent of the Republican vote would be
a springboard for tomorrow's Super Tuesday contest, when 11 states, seven of
them in the South, cast their ballots in presidential primaries or caucuses.
'I believe this will send a strong signal to all the Super Tuesday states,'
Mr Bush told his supporters at the weekend.
In the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, Governor Bill
Clinton of Arkansas received a boost from Saturday's voting, with an
overwhelming victory in South Carolina.
Mr Clinton - whose earlier career again came under the spotlight yesterday
with a newspaper report raising questions about his involvement in property
deals after he became governor - also won in Wyoming.
Mr Buchanan's 26 per cent share of the Republican primary vote fell below
the scores in New Hampshire and Georgia which enabled him to claim second
place as victory. But Buchanan campaigners still called the result another
vote of no confidence for Mr Bush, who benefited from the all-out support of
South Carolina's governor, Mr Carroll Campbell, and the state's entire
Republican establishment.
'In this state, 67 per cent, with this machine and governor, is a bad score
for George Bush,' said Mr Michael Graham, state co-ordinator for the
Buchanan campaign.
Some Republicans deserted their party's primary to vote for former
Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the Democratic ballot. But Bush and
Buchanan supporters agreed they had crushed the candidacy of Mr David Duke,
the former Ku Klux Klan leader who came near winning the governorship of
Louisiana last year. Mr Duke won 7 per cent of the Republican vote.
Mr Buchanan said he would not withdraw from the race despite suggestions
from the Bush campaign that he should. 'We will go to Michigan,' he said
'and make it the Georgia of the north' - a reference to his success there.
He indicated he would support Mr Bush in the presidential election if he
failed to win the nomination. But not all Mr Buchanan's supporters feel the
same way. 'I voted for George Bush in 1988 but he's turned out to be a wolf
in sheep's clothing. If Buchanan doesn't get the Republican nomination I
intend to vote for whatever candidate the Democrats run,' said Mr Bill Otto,
a broker in Columbia, the state capital.
Among the Democrats, Mr Clinton won more heavily than expected in South
Carolina, with 63 per cent against 19 for Mr Tsongas, his closest
challenger. 'What we were aiming for was 50 per cent. This is about as good
as you can do with someone running against you,' said Mr Frank Holleman,
state director of the Clinton campaign.
But Mr Clinton also won Wyoming's Democratic party caucuses, letting him
claim he region of the South. Mr Tsongas won Arizona's primary with 34 per
cent, compared with 29 per for Mr Clinton and 28 per cent for former
Governor Jerry Brown of California. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa won only 6
per cent of the vote in South Carolina, despite his last-minute bid for
black votes by campaigning with Mr Jesse Jackson and attacking Mr Clinton's
civil rights record. Mr Harkin is trying to keep his campaign alive until
Illinois and Michigan hold their primaries on March 17, but may be forced to
withdraw before that.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S political parties were yesterday facing the possibility of a snap
general election if Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's government is defeated in
a key parliamentary vote today.
Most observers believe an early election remains unlikely. But hurried
meetings yesterday of the Congress party and the opposition groupings
reflect the politicians' nervousness.
Mr Rao's government is not sure of obtaining an absolute majority to defeat
an opposition motion condemning the administration's handling of inflation
and unemployment.
The initial intention of the Opposition Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
and the left-wing parties had been simply to humiliate the government
through defeating it on an amendment. But at the end of last week, the prime
minister responded with brinkmanship of his own by declaring that he would
regard any defeat as bringing about the resignation of his government.
Mr Rao took such an extreme step in part to ensure full party support in
today's vote. But his move also reflects a cold calculation by Congress that
it might substantially improve its parliamentary position in an early poll.
Congress did unexpectedly well in recent local elections in the Punjab and
Bombay.
The BJP, however, responded to the prime minister's brinkmanship yesterday
with a display of cold nerves itself. The party's spokesman said that
'nothing can be ruled out in Monday's showdown'. But he added that, if the
government fell, it would be the responsibility of Congress.
The political crisis comes as the country's stock markets are due to reopen
today after their closure since Wednesday to curb speculative fever. The
presidents of the main stock markets called on investors to be cautious.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH fighting broke out between Armenian and Azerbaijani combatants
struggling for control of Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday despite a plea for
peace from Azerbaijan's interim president, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Armenia said Azerbaijani forces were still massed around the town of Askeran
and engaging in running skirmishes with the town's Armenian population 24
hours after some of the worst fighting in the four-year conflict in the
region.
The Karabakh Committee in the Armenian capital Yerevan said Armenian
defenders had destroyed one Azerbaijani tank.
The committee also reported fighting near Hathrouth in the south of
Nagorno-Karabakh and said Azerbaijani forces had rained shells on several
towns inside and outside the enclave after an early lull in the fighting.
Azerbaijan reported overnight shelling of Agdam, one of its chief towns just
outside Nagorno-Karabakh.
Mr Vahan Shirkhanyan, head of the Karabakh Committee, put the Armenian death
toll in the battle in Askeran at 200. He said 26 Armenians, many of them
women, had been killed when Azerbaijani forces overran the village of
Kazanchi.
The battle for Nagorno-Karabakh, administered by Azerbaijan for nearly seven
decades but populated mostly by Armenians, has intensified in recent weeks,
despite a welter of peace initiatives.
Azerbaijan's interim President Yagub Mamedov yesterday called for new
efforts to bring both sides to negotiations.
'We have to step up diplomatic efforts and get negotiations going quickly,'
he said.
But the 51-year-old former university rector, who succeeded President Ayaz
Mutalibov two days ago, may face domestic pressure to take a hawkish stance
on the conflict.
Mr Mutalibov was forced out of office last week by demonstrators who said he
had been soft on Armenia and had staked too much on a negotiated settlement.
Up to 2,000 people have died in four years of fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh,
making it the bloodiest conflict in scores of ethnic feuds that helped to
tear the Soviet Union apart.
The struggle also threatens to undermine the newly-formed Commonwealth of
Independent States.
Turkey yesterday issued a new call for peace in the region, with Mr Hikmet
Cetin, foreign minister, asking the US to use its influence for a solution.
Mr Cetin has been touring several former Soviet republics, including
Azerbaijan. Turkey has urged Azerbaijan to adopt a tougher stance in the
conflict, drawing charges from Armenian politicians that it is meddling in
the dispute to win the support of Moslem former Soviet republics.
Former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze, back in his native
Georgia to pursue a political career, appealed to the west yesterday for aid
for the Transcaucasian republic.
After 36 hours of talks with government leaders, he said: 'I'll be
straightforward: without aid from our friends - real democrats in all states
of the world - we will find it difficult to solve all our problems.'
Mr Shevardnadze, who steered the foreign policy of Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, says he will probably run for a seat in the Georgian parliament
once new elections are held. He has also not ruled out standing for the
presidency.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Budget cuts stand little chance of success
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PLANNED budget spending cuts by Poland's embattled centre-right government
led by Mr Jan Olszewski stand little chance of winning a majority in
parliament when the document comes up for debate next month.
The International Monetary Fund has told the government that the budget
deficit must stay within 5 per cent of GDP to guard against re-igniting
inflation. Should this target be over-stepped, then Poland will jeopardise
its chances of putting relations with the IMF back on an even keel.
Mr Olszewski's government has managed to find cuts worth Zl37,000bn (Pounds
1.59bn), and is seeking further savings of Zl27,000bn to cut the budget
deficit to its Zl65,500bn target.
However, a cabinet meeting on Friday heard that the proposed budget would
mean cuts in subsidies to rail travel and coal production as well as job
losses for school teachers and health service employees.
Last Thursday, parliament voted overwhelmingly for spending on health and
education to be kept at last year's levels in real terms and is unlikely to
accept the proposed cuts.
Mr Olszewski has said he will resign if the draft is not approved by the
politically-fragmented parliament, where nine parties jockey for position.
The World Bank has also warned the Poles that the budget deficit must be
kept under control and is urging speedy privatisation and growth in the
level of exports as the means of breaking out of the current impasse.

<TEXT>
A PARTNERSHIP first established between Germany's Weimar Republic and
Lenin's Bolsheviks could be revived under a proposal being examined by
airline executives in Frankfurt and Moscow.
Aeroflot, the airline of the now-defunct Soviet Union, is considering a
possible alliance with Lufthansa, the German national carrier. It would
involve route-sharing and other joint operations to help the former Soviet
carrier survive international competition.
Both airlines have invoked the memory of Deutsche Russische
Luftverkehrsgesellschaft, or Deruluft. This was an alliance begun in
November 1921 to fly between German cities and eastern Europe, including the
then-independent Baltic states.
Mr Vladimir Potapov, director-general of Aeroflot's international air
services, said: 'We want to return to that (relationship).' Such an alliance
would go beyond the joint venture it already has with Lufthansa to modernise
Moscow's Sheremetievo airport.
Mr Potapov gave no more details of talks with Lufthansa on further
co-operation, but said work was progressing despite problems with financing
the DM800m (Pounds 277m) airport project. The main problem was that plans
for a loan from a consortium of German banks needed new guarantees.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Early rate cut option recedes as pound weakens: Lamont
warned on easing loan costs in Budget week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCES of a cut in interest rates to accompany the Budget, or follow
shortly afterwards, have dwindled after last week's weakening of sterling
and nervousness in the market for government gilt-edged securities.
Although a politically inspired rate cut cannot be ruled out - especially if
the Budget is given an enthusiastic reception on financial markets - both
the Treasury and Bank of England have advised Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, against reducing rates this week.
The Bank of England has been trying for several weeks in its domestic money
market operations to dissuade traders from expecting an imminent cut in bank
base rates from the present 10.5 per cent level.
Some 10 days ago, the Treasury used the Treasury Bulletin to highlight the
limited scope for rate cuts since the differential between official UK and
German short term rates has fallen to 0.75 percentage points.
Since then, sterling has weakened in the exchange rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System and on Friday was at its EMS floor against the
Spanish peseta. Sterling is now around the level where it will require Bank
of England support in the ERM if it comes under selling pressure.
In a further sign of nervousness, prices for gilt-edged securities fell by
as much as 2 points last week, reflecting investors' fears about the
government's standing in the opinion polls and expectations that tomorrow's
Budget will see the announcement of a sharply higher public sector borrowing
requirement of Pounds 25bn or more for 1992-93 .
Ministers have been warned that reducing the 0.75-point premium of UK bank
base rates over the Bundesbank's 9.75 per cent Lombard emergency funding
rate might not be sustainable during an election campaign.
Officials have pointed to the example of France which was unable to keep its
rates at German levels in spite of a lower inflation rate than either
Germany or the UK and more than five years of successfully maintaining its
present ERM parity.
As late as last week, however, there were still strong expectations in the
City of a rate cut. A poll of 22 banks and investment houses in the UK,
carried out by MMS International, the business information group, on March
4, found that 71 per cent of respondents expected the next cut in base rates
'just after the Budget'.
UK interest rates were cut at Budget time for eight successive years in the
1980s. Last year - after two years without a Budget-week rate cut - Mr
Lamont cut rates by a half percentage point after waiting three days for
financial markets to digest his first Budget.
He will have to move quicker this week if he intends to cut rates. It is
generally expected that Mr John Major, the prime minister, will launch the
campaign for an April 9 general election on either Wednesday or Thursday,
after which a rate cut would be highly unusual.
By convention, UK governments do not cut rates in an election campaign.
Ministers have tended to regard such action as too overtly political.
Britain's annual Budget should be scrapped and replaced with a more
considered system of formulating fiscal policy, according to Sir Douglas
Wass, a former permanent secretary at the Treasury.
Sir Douglas said the Treasury's 'archaic' secrecy in preparing for the
Budget was unnecessary and reduced the possibilities of a public debate
about tax policy and the economy. Page 16

FT  09 MAR 92 / The economics of a Democratic victory: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be a mistake to exaggerate the economic merits of Governor Bill
Clinton and former Senator Paul Tsongas, the front-runners for the
Democratic presidential nomination. But if either ended up in the White
House, the US economic outlook could brighten noticeably.
After a decade of divided government, control of Congress and the White
House by the same party would offer great advantages. In recent years,
crippling federal deficits have partly reflected deep disagreements over the
appropriate level of taxes and spending. Given full accountability, either
party would probably have made a better fist of fiscal policy. Unified
government would also allow the development of a coherent longer-term
strategy for economic growth, something which political divisions, as much
as political ideology, have made impossible.
The merits of the leading Democrats are best compared by examining their
stance on three key issues neglected by the Republicans:
The need to increase the US national savings rate by converting budget
deficits into surpluses and eliminating fiscal incentives for consumption
and borrowing.
The need to address rapid increases in income and wealth inequalities that
are threatening social harmony.
The need to improve industrial performance, for example by lengthening the
time horizons of managers and improving training and education.
On the deficit, Mr Tsongas offers the greatest hope of progress.
Courageously rejecting conventional wisdom in Washington, he has built his
campaign around opposition to income tax cuts. On the stump, his case for
fiscal responsibility is reduced to a few short phrases: 'I'm not Santa
Claus. We're adults. Just tell us the truth. We can handle it.' In his
86-page pamphlet, A Call to Economic Arms, he calls for a steady increase in
petrol taxes towards international levels and discusses the merits of real
cuts in entitlement programmes such as health care and pensions. Given such
candour, it is surprising he is still in the race.
Mr Clinton is less convincing on the deficit, although he does promise to
restrain government spending to no more than the rate of economic growth.
But he comes into his own on the 'fairness issue', arguing for a 10 per cent
tax cut for middle-income Americans to be paid for by higher taxes on
families earning more than Dollars 200,000 a year.
If you instinctively bristle at plans for more redistribution, consider what
has happened in America. As the New York Times reported last week, pre-tax
incomes of the top 1 per cent rose 77 per cent in real terms between 1977
and 1989. The top fifth saw incomes rise 29 per cent. Everybody else did
badly: the second, third, fourth and bottom fifths saw real income gains of
9 per cent, 4 per cent, minus 1 per cent and minus 9 per cent respectively.
After allowing for taxes, the top 1 per cent has pocketed an amazing 60 per
cent of the total increase in income over the period. The top 5 per cent
gained 74 per cent of the increase; the bottom 80 per cent a mere 6 per
cent. You do not have to be a socialist to believe that some rejigging of
the tax burden is overdue.
Both Mr Clinton and Mr Tsongas have something to offer on the third issue -
improving industrial performance. Mr Clinton has focused mainly on improving
worker skills through better education and training. He deserves great
credit for stressing the importance of a national apprenticeship programme
for non-college bound youths - a group central to economic performance yet
long ignored by much of the educational establishment. He also favours
national exams to raise school standards and radical measures to make higher
education more affordable for the middle classes.
Mr Tsongas makes encouraging, if conventional, noises on education. But he
comes alive when discussing ways to strengthen America's manufacturing base,
including industrial policies. He infuriates many liberal Democrats by
advocating lower capital gains taxes on long-term equity investment, and
arguing that the party must pay more attention to the 'original act - the
creation of national wealth'.
Yet while criticised for being aggressively pro-business, he is far from an
uncritical believer in market forces. 'Adam Smith was a marvellous man but
he wouldn't know a superconductor or memory chip if he tripped over one,' he
says. He regards the post-war success of Japan as proof that intelligent
government intervention can help. He sees an industrial policy as less an
alternative to the market than a means of improving on it, especially in
high technology where huge investments are required. He advocates strategic
investments in emerging technologies, a modernisation of anti-trust laws to
permit more joint ventures, and efforts to lengthen the time horizons of
managers, for example by scrapping quarterly financial returns.
By stressing fairness, Mr Clinton is attracting strong support from blacks
and poorly educated blue-collar workers. Mr Tsongas's blunter message about
the importance of wealth creation is playing well with white-collar
Democrats and, one suspects, many moderate Republicans. Neither can be
dismissed as an old-style 'tax and spend' Democrat. With the support of
Congress, either would probably do more to raise national savings, heal
social divisions and address structural economic failings than a second Bush
administration. There is little to fear economically - and possibly much to
gain - from a Democratic victory in November.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Money Markets and Foreign Exchanges: Awaiting the Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar is expected to continue strong this week, but Tuesday's UK Budget
will focus attention on an uneasy trend in sterling, writes Neil Buckley.
The dollar should open strongly, buoyed up by the 164,000 rise in US
non-farm payrolls announced on Friday, while satisfactory news on retail
sales figures next Thursday and on producer prices index on the following
day could take it higher.
It faces a technical barrier at DM1.6825, but if this is crossed, it could
head for DM1.70.
Some economists, however, see a possible change of tack by the market.
'People have wanted to buy dollars on strong US numbers. But if anything,
the numbers we are seeing out of Germany are just as strong,' said Mr Nick
Parsons, treasury adviser at CIBC.
German factory orders have risen along with production, and unemployment has
fallen. Mr Parsons predicts that the D-mark could receive a boost if this
week's statistics on machinery orders, trade figures and wholesale prices
are well received.
In the UK, the market will be hoping that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
can balance prudence with a vote-winning Budget. Most estimates are for a
tax-cut give-away of Pounds 2bn-Pounds 4bn.
A base rate cut, however, looks unlikely following the weakness of sterling
last week. If the Budget fails to please the markets and the electorate,
then sterling could again come under pressure.
Dealers say sterling is vulnerable on the downside, with technical support
likely at DM2.8650, but a long drop to the next likely intervention level at
DM2.8280. If the Budget is followed by the announcement of a general
election, they warn of a period of great volatility, with sterling ready to
tumble at any indication of weakening Conservative support.

FT  09 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Eurobond clearing houses in
agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CEDEL and Euroclear, the two Eurobond clearing houses, have agreed to
exchange clearing information in a move that ends two years of dispute.
The new 'bridge' system, to come into force in October, will save about
Dollars 30m a year and increase efficiency. A long test period is needed
because of the technical complexity of the change, which involves Cedel
shifting to a system of overnight processing.
The agreement, signed in Paris on Friday, incorporates the concept of
delivery versus payment, which Cedel had resisted until now.
In 1990, the two firms agreed to renegotiate their 1980 'bridge' agreement
on the exchange of information, but until now have failed to resolve the
problem.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Syndicated Loans: Airlines face switch in source of finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRLINES, faced with the drying-up of their traditional sources of
financing, will be forced to find new sources of funding in order to cover
the enormous cost of expanding and upgrading aircraft fleets
Boeing, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft, last week
predicted that airlines would have to turn to the international capital
markets in order to raise the necessary funds, given that they will require
Dollars 857bn of new aircraft over the next 20 years.
This view is echoed by international bankers who believe there may be a
shift away from bank loans and leases as airlines turn to the bond markets
and more innovative forms of financing.
The problem for the airlines is that Japan, which during the 1980s was an
important source of aircraft financing - both through loans and leases - is
no longer such a willing supplier of funds.
The Japanese banks, which were once so keen to lend to airlines, are now
reluctant to participate because of concern about the international capital
adequacy requirements agreed by the Basle committee.
As one financing expert points out: 'Japanese banks are only interested in
lending to the good flight carriers, and are not at all interested in
lending to the weaker names.'
At the same time, as the Japanese banks are picking their borrowers more
carefully, the supply of leveraged lease deals from Japan is drying up. With
a finance lease, a group of investors buys the aircraft and then leases it
out to the airline. Such deals were particularly popular in Japan among rich
individuals and small businesses because of tax advantages, and these were
passed on to the airline in the form of reduced rentals.
Lease arrangements still continue, but not on the same scale as before,
since the Japanese authorities have clamped down on the tax advantages,
while the fall in the Japanese stock market means that companies and
investors have fewer gains to shelter.
'There have been problems for some time getting equity from the Japanese and
putting these Japanese leveraged leases together,' says one Japanese banker.
With banks less willing to lend money, margins on loans have increased
sharply. Two years ago, a leading European flag carrier would have paid a
margin of between 25 and 35 basis points over the London interbank offered
rate (Libor) on a 10 to 12-year loan. Now, the margin is more likely to be
in the region of 60 to 80 basis points, bankers say.
In view of the industry's future requirements, bankers point out that the
loan market will be unable to meet the demand. 'The way the market has been,
the banks simply cannot provide all that liquidity,' says one aircraft
finance expert.
'The airlines will need very large sums of money so there will have to be
alternative sources of finance such as public sector bond issues, with
institutional investors buying 10 or 12-year secured notes backed by the
aircraft.'

FT  09 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Fears arise on redeeming equity-linked
paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUGE sums of equity-linked bonds launched in the international bond market
in the late 1980s fall due for redemption this year and next.
Under normal circumstances the debt would simply be refinanced with new
equity-linked bond issues. However, many of the issuers never expected to
redeem the bonds, and the appetite of international investors for
equity-linked paper is much less than when the bonds were issued.
For example, companies which issued convertible bonds in the late 1980s
expected that debt would be converted into equity well before the redemption
date. However, equity prices remained soft and conversion never took place.
Similarly, companies which issued warrant bond issues against a background
of a booming equity market have found the warrants were never exercised and
the debt must now be refinanced on less attractive terms.
Equity-linked finance was a source of cheap funding for many companies. Many
Swiss franc convertible bond issues launched in the late 1980s carry no
interest payments. Investors were willing to buy the bonds as an investment
linked to the equity market.
Japanese companies were the greatest exponents of equity-linked finance in
the Eurobond market. In 1989 Dollars 65bn of warrant bond issues were
launched in the international market, the vast majority by Japanese
companies.
Securities firms became rich on the proceeds. On standard Euromarket fees of
2 1/4 per cent, the volume of new issuance in 1989 alone would have netted
Dollars 1.46bn of fee income. In addition, the majority of the issues traded
up from issue price, adding to the earnings of underwriters.
Some Dollars 32bn equivalent equity warrant bonds fall due for redemption
this year alone, rising to Dollars 78bn in 1993. Around Dollars 4.6bn of
Swiss franc convertible bond issues fall due this year, rising to over
Dollars 10bn in both 1993 and 1994.
These figures give only a rough guide to the amount of refinancing required.
Some of the bonds have been called after the warrants were exercised, and
others were converted into equity before the Tokyo stock market collapsed in
1990. But Japanese equity prices have languished well below the peak of the
late 1980s, when most of the bonds were issued.
The Nikkei stock market index is now trading at around 21,000, similar to
the levels seen in 1987 and well below the peak of 38,915 in early 1990.
This suggests that a large proportion of the outstanding bonds were never
converted into equity and that warrants were never exercised. Refinancing
these bonds poses a challenge to corporate financiers.
It is clear that the market will not absorb new issues of warrant bonds or
convertibles on the scale required for full refinancing. Last year only
Dollars 26bn of new equity warrant bond issues were launched, an improvement
on the Dollars 19bn issues in 1990 but still well below the levels achieved
at the peak of the market.
If the Tokyo stock market remains buoyant, the more popular companies may
refinance maturing debt with more equity-linked finance. However, many will
have to use other more costly instruments or simply swallow the fact that
debt must be redeemed.
Many Swiss franc issues falling due this year will be repaid at the end of
this month, the end of the Japanese fiscal year. Japanese companies may need
to buy around SFr2bn to SFr3bn to repay bonds.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Spanish Bonds: Madrid dealers fall for Maastricht factor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's Maastricht summit last December motivates Spanish
government bond traders and buyers every bit as much as it does those who
walk the Brussels corridors of power. Those who shuffle policy papers around
Eurocrat departments and those who in Madrid dealing rooms cradle telephones
and stare at VDU screens share an enthusiasm for convergence.
Madrid bond dealers unsurprisingly call it the Maastricht factor and they
love it. The factor has ensured attractive yields for the foreseeable
future. The bond market is looking very good, they say, and there is nothing
to suggest it will lose its looks.
Convergence was Maastricht's buzz word, and at the summit Spain committed
itself to narrowing the interest rate differential that sets it apart from
its northern European neighbours in order to make a soft landing in the
first-tier group of EC members that will form Economic and Monetary Union
(EMU).
Euro-enthusiasts may talk about binding the EC together and Spanish
government policy makers, obsessive about the value of EMU, are the chief
cheerleaders in the convergence fan club. Spanish bond market watchers, who
have taken convergence fully on board, know that such excitement means
lowered interest rates and improved yields.
Currently, the 10-year 11.30 coupon is yielding around 10.67; the five-year
11.60 is yielding 10.34; and the yield on the three-year 11.80 coupon is
11.41. Traders are monitoring a switch into the newer bonds, and they see
that foreign buyers have clearly understood Spain's determination to meet
the convergence criteria.
One startling implication is that the peseta, which is currently up in the
skies as the ceiling currency of the European Monetary System's exchange
rate mechanism (ERM), must buckle down to adjust from its present 6 per cent
band in the mechanism to one of 2.5 per cent.
Spain has until the end of 1993 to do so but already there is talk that the
switch may take place in the second semester of this year in conjunction
with the pound, the ERM's floor currency. A depreciation of the peseta is
inevitable this year. The likelihood is that it will be a controlled
depreciation geared to avoid panic among foreign investors.
Bullishness over an interest rate cut is fuelled by the particular strength
of the peseta which last week was stretching near to snapping its 6 per cent
margin against the pound. Nobody imagines the British interest rates going
up to narrow the gap; everybody expects Spanish rates to go down to ease the
pressure.
That is exactly what happened on February 25 when the Bank of Spain
introduced a 25 basis-point cut to bring its intervention rate down to
12.40. It did so as much as a favour to the pound as in preparation for
convergence.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, economy minister, said there was a need to favour 'a
more balanced situation' in the ERM.
Another cut, one in the range of 10 to 15 basis points, is on the cards in
the coming weeks for exactly the same reasons. In expectation of this
development, what the market has uppermost in its mind is that Mr Solchaga
has said that interest rates could fall by up to 1 percentage point this
year if the inflation rate performed well and if salary increases were
moderate.

FT  09 MAR 92 / US Money and Credit: Focus swings to pace of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORGET the bad news. Cast off the sackcloth and ashes. Start worrying
instead about the speed of the economic recovery.
Analysts who barely one month ago were predicting that another interest rate
cut was on the cards, have turned instead to fretting about the pace of any
upturn.
'It is now most appropriate to focus on the growing indications of a
re-acceleration of economic activity, the likelihood that inflation will
remain at 4 per cent or higher, and the likelihood that large budget
deficits will pressure the capital markets over the balance of the decade,'
suggested Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, in a circular to clients last week.
'There is increasing evidence . . . that the economy is poised for at least
a modest growth rebound in the second quarter,' said Mr David Hale at Kemper
Financial Services.
The steady stream of economic news last week appeared to support such
optimism, causing the yield on the benchmark 30-year long bond to reach 7.92
per cent by late Friday afternoon, compared with 7.79 per cent a week
earlier. This defensive tone, moreover, was evident throughout most of the
week's trading sessions. Only on Wednesday did prices firm slightly as
investors worried about the unemployment data due to be released on Friday,
and then again on Friday afternoon as that news was digested.
In fact, the unemployment figures were probably the most ambiguous
statistics to hit the markets during the five trading sessions. On the one
hand, non-farm payrolls in February rose by 164,000 - well in excess of the
10,000 gain generally predicted. But this was tempered by a significant
re-adjustment in the January figures - the estimated payroll drop of 91,000
was revised to a 149,000 fall.
Moreover most analysts noted that the rise in February's non-farm payrolls
could largely be attributed to the medical services sector and to retailing.
The latter, however, was abnormally depressed in the first quarter of 1991,
partly due to uncertainties induced by the Gulf war.
The headline unemployment figure, meanwhile, rose by 0.2 points to 7.3 per
cent, while most pundits had pitched their estimates at around 7.1 per cent.
As Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities, observed: 'These
two job reports purport to measure the same economy; but they have it going
in different directions in February - a short month, packed with holidays
bearing outsized seasonal factors.'
This muddled picture, however, was in sharp contrast to the positive data
unveiled earlier in the week. On Monday, the national purchasing managers'
index (NPMI) for February rose to 52.4 per cent, compared with 47.4 per cent
in the previous month. Analysts generally had been anticipating a much
smaller improvement.
On Tuesday, moreover, the NPMI data was supported by a sharp advance in the
January index of leading economic indicators, and by a fairly healthy 12.9
per cent surge in new single-home sales that month.
Whether any of this is likely to unlease inflationary forces remains a moot
point, however. Many analysts are sanguine, suggesting that the annual rate
will remain at around 3.5 per cent.
Maverick voices can be heard. DLJ, for example, argues that something over 4
per cent may be more likely. Analysts there note that the year-on-year
inflation rate for the consumer price index, net of food and fuel, has only
dropped below 4 per cent once during the past decade.
Inflation trends will be one of the main focal points in the current week.
On Friday, the February producer price index figures are due to arrive, with
most analysts predicting a modest 0.2 per cent increase in both the 'core'
and overall indices. This would follow a 0.3 per cent fall in the 'non-core'
rate in January, caused primarily by declining energy prices.
A day earlier, attention is likely to centre on the retail sales figures for
the same month. Here, forecasts appear to be more widely spread - from a 0.6
per cent improvement or 0.3 per cent excluding cars, to as much as 0.9 per
cent and 0.5 per cent respectively. Data at the upper end of this scale
would probably convince bond traders that recovery is well under way, and
fuel inflation fears. Bond prices, in turn, could fall further.

FT  09 MAR 92 / UK Gilts: Political jitters prompt sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SOMETHING had to give
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and it did. After two months of highly respectable price rises, the gilt
market last week went into reverse on fears about a poor showing for the
Tories in the general election and a big rise in the public sector borrowing
requirement (PSBR) in the next two years.
With all eyes focused on tomorrow's Budget, gilt investors suffered an
attack of nerves, with buying pressure extremely subdued and many interested
in swapping out of UK bonds and into those issued by other governments.
As a result, prices of some types of gilt fell by as much as 2 points over
the week. There was a consequent increase in yields.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is widely expected in his Budget to inject
up to Pounds 4bn into the economy, partly through tax cuts, in a bid to
revive the flagging economy and cheer up voters ahead of the election.
While this might in theory be good for the Conservatives' re-election
chances, a move of this kind is also likely to push up sharply the PSBR.
That worries many in the gilt market, both because it could kick off a spell
of inflationary pressures and also because a large amount of borrowing would
feed through to large, price-depressing gilt issues over the next year or
so.
Such fears triggered a gilt sell-off, led by overseas investors. The
Treasury 9 per cent bond maturing in 2008 fell from 99 at the beginning of
the week to 97 1/8 on Friday night, for a yield of 9.34 per cent.
The shorter-dated 10 per cent Treasury bond due in 1994 fell by a smaller
amount, from 101 3/32 to 100 21/32 , yielding 9.65 per cent.
Many observers believe that the PSBR will rise from about Pounds 12bn in
1991-92 to roughly Pounds 25bn in 1992-93. It could go up to Pounds 35bn in
1993-94, according to some projections. Many economists are not comfortable
about such figures, particularly in the context of the Budget.
Mr John Shepperd, an economist at Warburg Securities, says: 'A tax give-away
when the public sector is swinging into deficit is causing some concern in
the gilt market.'
Others are more relaxed. Mr Roger Bootle, chief UK economist at Greenwell
Montagu, says: 'While I would want to keep the PSBR under close scrutiny, a
rising deficit is acceptable at a time when the UK is still in serious
recession.'
Mr Malcolm Roberts, a bond specialist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew follows a
similar line. He expects the Treasury to have little trouble finding gilts
buyers over the next year or so, even if gilt issues rise steeply, as many
in the market expect. Some reckon issues could run to Pounds 30bn in
1992-93, roughly twice the level this year.
Mr Roberts says: 'The markets take the view that there is plenty of time for
the deficits to come down again later in the decade, after the economy has
picked up.'
However, in the frenetic political atmosphere ahead of the election, such
calm, long-term considerations do not count for very much in the gilt
market. One of the big talking points is the poor showing by the Tories in
recent opinion polls.
Many gilt practitioners view a Labour government as likely to kick off a
still bigger borrowing spree and running into problems in keeping sterling
steady within the European exchange rate mechanism - both developments being
negative for the gilt market. Hence if the lacklustre results for the
Conservatives from the polls continue, gilts may continue to slide.
It was all different at the end of last year, with a strong demand for gilts
from UK institutions and also, as figures from the Central Statistical
Office last week showed, from overseas investors.
An analysis of capital flows into the UK in the fourth quarter indicated
that overseas investors bought Pounds 1.2bn of gilts in the final three
months, after Pounds 540m in the third quarter.

FT  09 MAR 92 / International Company News: Philips offers to buy remainder
of Super Club
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, has offered to buy out minority
shareholders in Super Club, the troubled Belgian-based chain of video rental
shops, in return for their support of a 'drastic' financial restructuring of
the loss-making company.
If the deal goes ahead, Philips said it would pay cash or issue new shares
of its own to take over the 49 per cent stake in Super Club which it does
not yet control.
Philips, which has repeatedly come to Super Club's rescue since 1990, will
soon call a special meeting of Super Club's bankers and bondholders to
discuss the restructuring of a BFr2.5bn (Dollars 73.5m) bond issue and other
loans.
'It is essential that the banks as well as the bondholders agree that they
should make financial sacrifices,' Super Club said.
In return for these unspecified sacrifices, Philips would guarantee all the
Belgian company's bonds and loans. Philips will also agree to buy out
minority shareholders, based on a valuation to be performed by an
independent bank. Philips has already pumped some Fl 400m (Dollars 215m)
into Super Club, representing one of the only investments it has made since
running into difficulties of its own in 1990.
Minority shareholders intend to press Philips to value Super Club at around
BFr2,000 a share, the price prevailing in March 1991 when Philips assumed
majority control. Although Philips is expected to resist these demands, it
is likely to pay well over Fl 200m to remaining shareholders.
The proposals, which mark a further deepening of Philips' involvement in the
ailing Belgian venture, follow news that Super Club posted a loss of
BFr4.3bn in the first nine months of its 1991 financial year, due mainly to
high financing costs. In the previous financial year, which covered 14
months, Super Club made a loss of BFr14.7bn.
Super Club said its results would continue to come under pressure from the
high cost of its indebtedness.

FT  09 MAR 92 / International Company News: Parretti claims victory in
latest MGM-Pathe twist

MR GIANCARLO Parretti, the controversial Italian financier, claimed
yesterday that he had scored a court victory in Rome in his long-running
battle with Credit Lyonnais, the French state bank, for control of
MGM-Pathe, the financially crippled Hollywood studio.
Mr Parretti said a Rome court had ordered the sequestration of shares in
Pathe Communications and MGM-Pathe Communications, throwing into confusion
an earlier US court decision giving control of the MGM board to Credit
Lyonnais nominees.
Full details of the decision were not released. However, the move probably
represents an attempt by Mr Parretti to bring Credit Lyonnais, whose Dutch
subsidiary Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland largely financed his Dollars 1.3bn
November 1990 takeover of MGM-Pathe, back to the negotiating table.
Mr Parretti said in an interview last night he believed a compromise
solution would be found, but pledged to 'defend my company'.
The mercurial Italian financier - who said he was still appealing a
four-year jail sentence in connection with his conviction on fraud charges
in Naples - argued that the Rome ruling would mean the immediate ousting of
Mr Alan Ladd, the MGM chairman backed by Credit Lyonnais.
Mr Parretti said that in place of Mr Ladd, the Rome judge had appointed Mr
Cesare De Michelis, the brother of Mr Gianni De Michelis, Italy's foreign
minister.
Last December, Credit Lyonnais gained control of Pathe Communications after
a long legal battle in the US.
Voting rights for Mr Parretti's controlling stake in Pathe Communications,
which in turn controls MGM-Pathe, were subsequently allocated to Credit
Lyonnais, which installed new management.
Mr Parretti and two associates were removed as directors.
There is now likely to be frenzied legal activity ahead of a second legal
hearing, set for April 28, when the Rome court will decide whether to
confirm the sequestration. Mr Parretti may well seek to use the interval to
negotiate a deal with Credit Lyonnais.

<TEXT>
NORWAY is preparing for the merger of its central bank and the Banking
Insurance Securities Commission (BISC) - a government-funded watchdog - as
pressure mounts on Mr Svein Aasmundstad, the controversial head of BISC, to
step down.
The finance ministry has set up a four-person committee to study the
feasibility of such a merger. A decision is expected in early May when the
revised national budget for 1992 will be unveiled.
A merger would end the autonomy of the BISC, set up five years ago, but it
would strengthen its credibility, which has been called into question on
several occasions because of Mr Aasmundstad's public outspokenness.
In a recent outburst, a local news agency quoted the BISC chief as saying
that the government was considering a write-down of the value of Den norske
Bank's shares to zero.
Afterwards, trading in DnB's volatile shares was suspended on the Oslo
bourse for several hours on February 28. Before the suspension they plunged
NKr1.70 to NKr5.30 on concerns over the bank's capital adequacy. The finance
ministry quickly issued a statement confirming that DnB's capital adequacy
met legal limits.
In a separate incident, Mr Aasmundstad last June warned that the government
could intervene in Fokus Bank, the third biggest bank, until a bigger
Norwegian bank was found to take it over. At that time, Fokus enjoyed a
bourse listing and its future nationalisation was not yet known.
The BISC chief's candour on stock-sensitive information is understood to
annoy bourse and other finance officials.
The idea of a merger of BISC and the central bank was first floated last
June by Mr Hermod Skaanland, the central bank's governor, in a speech on the
occasion of the bank's 150th anniversary. Mr Skaanland said then that a
synergy could be derived from integrating the two institutions.
Mr Aasmundstad's future was discussed last Friday with Mr Arne Oeien,
secretary-general of the finance ministry. The ministry said the issue would
be clarified in consultation with Mr Aasmundstad.

FT  09 MAR 92 / International Company News: Moller sees threat in disclosure
changes

<TEXT>
DENMARK'S biggest business, the A. P. Moller (APM) shipping, shipbuilding,
energy and industrial group, is under political pressure to increase its
financial disclosure.
Rules covering companies listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange exempt
shipping lines from the obligation of disclosing figures in half-year
reports, if the companies judge disclosure would damage their competitive
position.
A committee of experts reporting to the industry ministry has recommended
the continuation of this dispensation, which is utilised by the APM holding
companies, 1912 and Svendborg. However three political parties with a
combined majority in the Folketing - the Social Democrats, the Radical
Liberals and the Socialist People's Party - are calling for an end to the
exemption.
APM argues that since many of its main competitors, especially Far Eastern
shipping lines, do not publish annual reports, it has a strong interest in
holding disclosure to a minimum. APM's Maersk Line is the world's second
largest shipping company by container capacity. Taiwan's Evergreen is the
largest.
Maersk is so well-financed that it has not raised new equity capital through
the market for many decades, raising speculation that it might withdraw its
Copenhagen listing rather than meet more stringent disclosure requirements.
Meanwhile, APM has disclosed that it owns 8.11 per cent of Den Danske Bank,
the country's largest, making APM the second-largest shareholder after the
National Labour Market Pension Fund, with 8.44 per cent.
The disclosure follows new rules requiring those with more than 5 per cent
of shares in a company to reveal their holdings.
The same rules led to the disclosure of AMP's ownership. Mr Maersk McKinney
Moller, 78, the shipowner who heads the group, personally holds 5.98 per
cent of the voting shares in Svendborg and 5.81 per cent in 1912. Mr Moller
and his family foundations together control 55.47 per cent of the votes in
Svendborg and 62 per cent of the votes in 1912.
As Moller business operations are owned by twin parent companies - neither
of which holds a majority of the shares - APM is not legally a group under
Danish law and therefore does not publish consolidated accounts.

GAMBRO, the Swedish medical equipment maker, has revealed a 46 per cent rise
in 1991 pre-tax profit to SKr594m (Dollars 98m). It increased its dividend
by 25 per cent to SKr3.75.
The company said there had been good demand for its main products, which
include kidney treatment and heart surgery equipment.
The improvement is also due to the acquisition of Cobe Laboratories, a US
producer of dialysis machines and surgery equipment, in June 1990. Gambro's
US operations, which formerly lost money, have become profitable as a result
of the purchase.
Gambro last month strengthened its marketing position in the US by
increasing its stake in Ren Corporation, which operates dialysis clinics,
from 23 to 30 per cent.
Sales during the period increased 31 per cent to SKr5.6bn. Operating profit
increased 39 per cent to SKr784m, but Gambro's interest costs rose 27 per
cent to SKr283m as a result of the Cobe purchase.

FT  09 MAR 92 / International Company News: Trade in Italy's BNA to resume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura (BNA) and affiliated companies
forming Italy's second-largest private-sector banking group will resume
normal trading today after a decision on Friday by Consob, the country's
stock market watchdog. However, investors will be banned from taking short
positions in order to damp any speculation.
Cosob had suspended shares of BNA - as well as Bonifiche Siele Finanziaria,
its holding company, and Interbanca, its long-term lending subsidiary -
after conflicting reports last month that the group's controlling
shareholder, Count Giovanni Auletta Armenise, had decided to sell his stake.
Count Auletta owns around 52 per cent of the ordinary shares in Bonifiche
Siele, which in turn controls BNA.
BNA, which is one of Italy's least profitable banks, has been the subject of
intense speculation ever since Credito Italiano, the big public-sector bank,
mounted an unsuccessful attempt to buy control in 1989, leaving it with 22
per cent of Bonifiche Siele and 8.2 per cent of BNA.
Since then, BNA has been in limbo. While bankers have doubted Count
Auletta's ability to meet its growing financial needs from his own
resources, he has consistently denied any plans to sell out, whether to
Credito Italiano or others.
Last month Mr Giuseppe Gennari, a financier and former adviser to Count
Auletta, announced he had decided to buy the count's shares for around
L1,200bn (Dollars 959m).
Mr Gennari already owned around 17 per cent of Bonifiche Siele. However,
shortly after the announcement, Count Auletta denied any agreement to sell,
prompting confusion in the market and Consob's decision to suspend the
shares.
CREDIT Lyonnais, the leading French bank, has spent L80bn (Dollars 64m) on a
12.8 per cent stake in Banca Agricola Milanese (BAM), a small Italian
regional bank based in Milan.
Credit Lyonnais is already strongly represented in northern Italy, where it
owns the majority of Credito Bergamasco, a highly-profitable regional bank.
The French institution is known to be keen to expand its Italian presence
further.
However, it is unclear whether the latest move by Credit Lyonnais represents
a first step in gaining control of BAM, or a tidying-up of accounts. BAM is
majority-owned by Banca Popolare di Milano, Italy's second biggest
co-operative bank, which has shown no interest in relinquishing control.

FT  09 MAR 92 / UK Company News: A plea that could put an end to an 'unfair
tax' - Nagging worry for companies with an international flavour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMEWHERE in the Chancellor's in-tray is a heartfelt plea from some of
Britain's biggest companies that tomorrow's Budget will end what they see as
an unfair tax penalty for internationally minded firms.
Advance Corporation Tax is a central part of UK corporate taxation. For the
most part, it works smoothly - and there are few complaints. But for those
companies with big overseas operations, it is a nagging worry.
Aggrieved finance directors say it is starting to affect the way companies
run their businesses, driving them into moving research and development
centres abroad, or making UK acquisitions they would otherwise not have
considered.
The problem starts with a highly desirable feature of the UK tax system  -
shareholders are taxed only once on income from investments. Before
distributing dividends, companies deduct ACT from them and pay it to the
Inland Revenue. For basic rate taxpayers, dividends are then tax-free.
When the time comes for the company to settle its corporation tax bill, it
deducts the ACT it has already paid.
For most companies, the system works perfectly: ACT is paid on dividends,
then deducted from mainstream corporation tax so that the income that flows
through to taxpayers is taxed only once.
One side effect of the system is that for any company that pays no
mainstream corporation tax but still pays dividends, ACT acts as a sort of
minimum tax. No bad thing, thought parliament at the time.
Since then, this occasional development has become much more common. For
three reasons:
UK dividends have risen faster than profits in recent years. Industrial
companies paid out over half their earnings as dividends in 1991. A higher
dividend payment raises the relative importance of ACT vis-a-vis mainstream
corporation tax, setting the 'minimum tax', if payable, at a higher level.
Big British companies have become increasingly international, deriving
ever-larger proportions of profits from abroad. The recession, which has
hurt UK operations disproportionately badly, has further increased this
effect.
Corporation tax rates have been cut sharply, to levels below those of most
other countries. This is a good thing - but it means overseas taxes
reclaimable against UK tax bills may well wipe out all of a company's
liability for mainstream corporation tax, leaving them with nothing to claim
back ACT against.
So ACT acts as a minimum tax on dividends, on top of those overseas taxes
they cannot reclaim.
Tax charges for big UK companies have been rising sharply as a result. GKN,
which recently reported, paid 43 per cent of its profits in tax - up from 35
per cent the year before; the effective tax rates for other big motor
component-makers could be as high as 70 per cent, analysts say.
A recent study commissioned by the 100 Group of big-company finance
directors estimated that each year UK companies pay Pounds 400m a year in
'surplus' ACT - tax which cannot be reclaimed against mainstream corporation
tax. That may even be an underestimate, according to government sources.
One obvious solution is for companies to reduce their dividends - but they
say that this is simply unrealistic.
'For us to reduce dividend payments there would have to be a significant
change of heart by institutional investors,' says Mr Roger Wood, group
finance director of Wimpey.
Instead, they find other palliatives. One such - made possible by the
transatlantic merger that formed SmithKline Beecham - is to have two types
of equity so that overseas shareholders, at least, escape the ACT burden.
Another is to move costs abroad. Finance directors point to Pilkington's
recent move abroad of research and administrative offices for its glass
operations as a decision in which ACT considerations played a role.
A third solution might be to invest in the UK rather than abroad. That might
damage the business in the long term, however. 'We are world leaders in
constant-velocity joints,' says Brian Walsh, GKN's finance director. 'Our
customers are world companies. They want to have their suppliers at their
elbow. Given that, there is no way we can just be a UK manufacturer.'
So finance directors lobby the Treasury. They would like small adjustments
to the impact of ACT in the short term. In the longer term, they want bigger
reforms. Suggestions include a new ACT-free 'international holding company'
status for those businesses that work mostly overseas.
Another idea is a liberalised market in surplus ACT so that companies with
lots of it could sell it on, at a discount, to companies with remaining
mainstream corporation tax against which to offset it. A third thought is to
make ACT offsetable against all taxes - including those overseas.
The taxman is not sympathetic. One result of lower UK taxes is to make
investing in the UK more attractive: the ACT effect is just one way in which
that process takes place.
Is a system that subtly biases UK companies towards domestic investment
necessarily a bad thing? Would companies really prefer to solve the ACT
problem by moving back to a system where dividend income was taxed twice, as
in the US? And why should UK taxpayers compensate shareholders of a small
group of UK companies for the tax rates set by foreign governments?
Still, with the plight of UK companies much in evidence this year, finance
directors have not lost hope. They would like a short-term easing of the
system; they would settle for a promise of a longer term review of the
issue.
Because the problem is so complex, however, and affects such a relatively
small number of companies, they may get neither.

FT  09 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Bank may have left SE in dark over Blue
Arrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England may have withheld crucial information about County
NatWest's role in the failed Blue Arrow rights issue from Stock Exchange
officials in late 1987, according to Mr Robert Wilkinson, a former stock
exchange director of surveillance.
Mr Wilkinson's remarks, in a Channel Four programme by Fulcrum Productions,
will fuel debate about the Bank's duel roles of promoting and policing the
City.
The programme, due to be screened on Thursday, suggests that the Bank left
the Stock Exchange in the dark about County NatWest's holding of Blue Arrow
shares after shareholders only took up their rights to 38 per cent of the
shares on offer.
Four City financial advisers were last month convicted of conspiracy to
defraud over their handling of the Pounds 837m rights issue for the
employment agency. After the offer closed County NatWest and other
institutions bought extra shares to make it appear that the issue had been
less undersubscribed.
When the stock market crashed in 1987, Stock Exchange officials were aware
that County had a large exposure to a big listed company. The Bank had
already been told County was looking at a Pounds 43m loss on this interest.
But the Bank would not reveal to Mr Wilkinson the identity of the company in
which County had its large stake. This was, according to Mr Wilkinson, 'for
reasons of banking secrecy'.
County had told the Bank that it had taken on the unwanted Blue Arrow shares
the day after the rights issue flopped on 28 September 1987, according to
the programme.
Conspiracy charges are outstanding against four other individuals involved
in the rights issue. The SFO is expected to announce shortly whether it will
proceed with a second Blue Arrow trial.

<TEXT>
CLF YEOMAN, the Dublin-based asset finance company, returned profits of
IPounds 7.28m (Pounds 6.8m) pre-tax for the 18 months to end-August 1991.
That compared with profits of IPounds 8.46m for the year to February 28
1990.
A tax charge of IPounds 18.71m (credits IPounds 2.38m) and restructuring
charges of IPounds 125.55m, which were taken below the line as extraordianry
items, left the company IPounds 137m in loss for the 18 months.
Along with the results the company gave further details of the sale of CLF
Holdings, its troubled UK ticket leasing subsidiary. The offshoot was
disposed of 'for a nominal amount' as part of a planned restructuring of the
CLF Yeoman group which the board proposes should be renamed Yeoman
International.
Yeoman is involved in litigation arising from the acquisition of CLF but has
reached agreement with its syndicate banks on the chief points involved in
restructuring the Pounds 39m debt which helped fund the purchase of CLF.

CADBURY Schweppes South Africa, part of the UK confectionery, food and soft
drinks group, reported a 33.5 per cent increase in earnings in 1991 despite
the poor performance of the national economy.
Turnover rose 13.4 per cent to R610m, while operating profit went up by 28.6
per cent to R60.6m.
Attributable income was higher at R46.8m (R35.1m).
Mr Peter Bester, managing director, said that there was a marginal fall in
sales volumes, but benefits from rationalisation and integration of
Chapelat-Humphries, the sugar confectionery business acquired in 1989, and
improved internal efficiencies and a better product mix had contributed to
the improved operating performance.
The remaining 17.5 per cent minority holding in Chapelat was bought for
R19.4m, effective April 1992.
Benefits from the Chapelat-Humphries acquisition allowed Cadbury's to record
considerably higher operating profits despite difficult trading conditions
and some labour difficulties.

<TEXT>
BAD LOANS forced Britannia, the tenth largest building society, to make the
heaviest provisions in its history against possible losses during 1991.
Provisions were up from Pounds 7.3m in 1990 to Pounds 33.7m last year,
driving the society's pre-tax profits down by 13 per cent from Pounds 73.6m
to Pounds 64m.
Total group assets rose by 15 per cent in 1991 to Pounds 8.5bn (Pounds
7.42bn).
Britannia's savings business rose by 21.6 per cent during the year to Pounds
834.9m compared with Pounds 686.5m and the society's assets grew by a
further Pounds 175.4m as a result of its merger with the Mornington Building
Society.
During August, the society temporarily withdrew from the commercial mortgage
market.
Before provisions, Britannia's profits were up by 20.7 per cent and Mr
Michael Shaw, managing director, said that it had made significant progress
in a severely depressed market, and improved its market share on both sides
of its business.
Britannia Life, the small life assurance and investment company which
Britannia bought and demutualised two years ago, was said to have returned
excellent results and made a better contribution to profits.
In August 1991, it bought Crusader Insurance and increased its funds under
management to Pounds 1.2bn.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Airline ticket shops bridge the Atlantic: The merger of
Apollo and Galileo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airline industry mergers are possible after all. Just one week after talks
between British Airways and KLM, the Dutch airline, collapsed, two of the
world's biggest computerised reservation systems, Apollo of the US and
UK-based Galileo, announced they are to merge.
The trend towards global air transport provoked the 11 airlines that owned
both systems to bury their differences to create a new Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds
850m) company
Although five of the 11 - BA, KLM, United Airlines, Swissair and Alitalia -
held stakes in Galileo and Apollo, the deal is the first big merger in a
business where most participants are state-owned and jealously guard their
independence.
Each of the world's handful of computer reservation systems (CRSs) carries
information on hundreds of airlines. Travel agents can search for the
cheapest fares, or ask for specific departure times or the fewest stops.
Bookings can then be made and tickets issued.
Passengers increasingly want to book flights anywhere in the world from
their home countries. Business travellers need complex itineraries in
advance and may want to change them during the trip. A CRS needs to be
available in travel agencies around the world to serve these markets.
CRSs do more than just sell tickets. Agents can use them to arrange car
rental or rail tickets and cabins on cruise liners. Mostly they book
passengers into hotels, some of which are owned by the airlines.
Such is the lure of world domination, that even the biggest CRS, Sabre,
owned by American Airlines, has sought in vain to merge with one of the two
large European rivals, Amadeus, owned by Lufthansa of Germany, Iberia of
Spain and Air France.
Apollo is the second biggest and Galileo is the other European CRS. Their
merger is not as dramatic as if airlines themselves had merged. But the
driving force that created Galileo International - globalisation of the
industry - has also pushed carriers on both sides of the Atlantic to take
stakes in each other and hold unsuccessful merger talks.
Perhaps most importantly, airline involvement in a CRS could allow them to
make more money from each aircraft seat. The airlines call it inventory
control. Almost 30 different fares are sold on each transatlantic Boeing
747. Airlines struggle daily to cut prices enough to sell seats but keep
them high enough to make money. They must be prepared to switch wide-bodied
jets quickly to new routes if demand rises and decide when to offer
upgrades.
'Airlines can maximise their revenue streams by inventory control. It's
indispensable,' says Mr Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst with Morgan Stanley
in New York.
The dividing line between success and failure is fine. American Airlines,
one of the top two in the US, says that one extra passenger on every flight
would add Dollars 114m to revenues and almost that much to profits. Last
year was one of the worst years in its, and the industry's, history.
American was about two passengers a flight short of profitability.
'The CRS is the way into controlling passenger flows and will become more
important with passenger growth,' says Mr Richard Allen, airlines analyst
with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London.
Such control is not cheap. Amadeus has spent Dollars 3bn establishing
itself, much of it on software.
Sabre, the biggest CRS and owned by American Airlines, takes bookings for
1.6m flights daily and deals with 20 times that many enquiries on 740
airlines.
The rewards can be high. Sabre's turnover was about Dollars 550m last year
in spite of the Gulf War and recession-induced slump in air traffic. Sabre
has a bigger turnover than American Airlines' entire cargo operation. In
spite of its size, Sabre attempted a merger last year with Amadeus. The plan
foundered in October largely because the computers were incompatible.
Amadeus is talking to Worldspan and System One, the third and fourth biggest
US CRSs. 'We hope to make an announcement on technical links with Amadeus
within weeks,' says Mr Roy Burnham, Worldspan's European managing director.
Mr John Pope, chairman of the consortium that runs Apollo and a
vice-chairman of United Airlines, said the deal cemented and formalised the
relationship with Galileo.
The two groups faced few technical problems. Galileo had licenced its
software from Apollo, and they have set up task forces to examine ways to
cut costs.
Mr Pieter Bouw, president of Galileo and chairman of KLM, the Dutch airline,
says most savings will come from staff cuts among about 500 data-processing
staff in Swindon, headquarters of the pre-merger Galileo. The computer
centre for Galileo International will be in Denver, Colorado. In return, the
European airlines in Galileo International can appoint the first chairman of
the group.
Mr Bouw refuses to commit himself over whether lower costs mean falling
booking fees. And he struggles to identify any tangible benefits to
passengers.
The savings will probably end up on the bottom line of the airline industry
and add to the reputation of CRSs as money-making machines. Airline chief
executives would rather sell their airlines than lose their reservation
systems, runs an after-dinner joke in the industry.
Yet sell their reservation systems is what they may be asked to do. The US
Department of Transport is scheduled to re-examine CRS industry rules before
the summer. It is worried about the potential advantages ownership of a CRS
gives. CRS owners will be able to control inventories better; new airlines
will face higher barriers in an already capital-intensive business.
Top of the list for criticism is Sabre because it is owned by a single
airline. American Airlines insists Sabre does not promote its own tickets.
Other CRS owners are equally adamant their technology has no favourites. But
that will not make the critics go away, and pressures to float off CRSs as
independent corporations are likely to grow.
One response is further mergers. Diluting the ownership among greater
numbers of airlines could deflect criticism.
But the bigger prize to be won through consolidation is raising the value of
the system. CRSs executives give few clues as to the worth of networks. But
by taking the value of Apollo as Dollars 1bn in 1988, when a half share was
sold by United Airlines, taking into account traffic growth since then and
the systems' estimates of their market shares, Sabre alone could be worth at
least Dollars 1.5bn.
The recent history of the airline industry is littered with failed attempts
to create international mergers. CRS collaboration may yet provide a model
for the world's airlines to join forces to offer one-stop shopping for the
aircraft as well as the tickets.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Many fund managers see hung parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK FUND managers remain convinced the Conservatives will emerge as the
strongest single party in the UK House of Commons after the general
election, although a significant number now foresee a hung parliament,
according to the latest survey by Smith New Court, the UK securities house,
and the Gallup polling organisation.
Managers are optimistic about the outlook for domestic interest rates and
inflation but slightly less bullish on UK equities than when last polled. A
balance of 30 per cent of managers intend to reduce holdings in US equities,
which are widely seen in London as over-valued at current levels on the Dow
Jones Industrial Average.
For this week's budget speech from Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of
the exchequer, the 101 institutions surveyed, which handle funds worth
Pounds 523bn, are in broad agreement. An overall net tax reduction of around
Pounds 3bn, including a 1p cut in basic rate income tax, accords with the
general view in the City of London.
However, many managers reiterated alarm signalled last week in the bond and
currency markets over the outlook for the Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement (PSBR). The consensus is that the chancellor will on Tuesday
announce a PSBR of Pounds 23bn for 1992-1993. But 5 per cent of those
surveyed fear a PSBR estimate of Pounds 30bn or more.
Increasing concern over the outlook for US equities displayed in the survey
was counterbalanced by enthusiasm towards continental European equity
markets where 38 per cent of managers plan to increase their holdings. While
opinions on UK equities remained positive, the net 10 per cent of managers
taking the bullish view had fallen from a net 17 per cent in January.
On longer-term prospects, 75 per cent of the survey was bullish on the
outlook for UK market over the next 12 months, while for Japan, the balance
on the positive side was 73 per cent and for Europe 49 per cent. A balance
of 2 per cent is bearish for the US equity markets for the year ahead.
UK optimism is based on expectations that the economic background will
improve this year. Managers believe that in 12 months base rates will be
down to 9.2 per cent from the present 10.5 per cent, while yields on 15-year
high coupon government bonds will have fallen to 8.9 per cent.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Economics Notebook: The road to EMU develops some potholes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAKESPEARE asked: 'What's in a name?' The question on the lips of Europe's
central bankers is 'What's in a clause?'
The argument about central banking independence is crucial to the political
jousting over European Monetary Union (EMU). Parliaments around Europe are
being called on to ratify the treaty for EMU agreed last December at
Maastricht. The small print will be keenly scrutinised.
There are strong indications from the German Bundesbank and the Bundestag
(lower house of parliament) that treaty language on EMU which might have
seemed acceptable three months ago now looks less than adequate to settle
German qualms about giving up the D-mark.
The pivotal component of EMU, set to take place at the latest by 1999
according to the Maastricht timetable, would be an 'independent' European
central bank (ECB) running the future single European currency.
At the insistence of the Germans, heads of government at Maastricht agreed a
statute for the mooted ECB assuring that the bank should not take
'instructions' from governments.
Indeed, the statute goes further than the 1957 Bundesbank Law in assuring
the prime goal of price stability. The law governing the Bundesbank talks
more vaguely of 'safeguarding the currency' - a concept which was first
introduced into the Reichsbank Law in 1939, and interpreted for most of the
first 20 years of the Bundesbank's existence as establishing exchange rate
stability as the priority.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, is a great believer in
EMU - but on Germany's terms. He is one of the leading figures in Germany
challenging the assumption that clauses in central bank statutes, by
themselves, are enough to guarantee a low inflation rate.
For Mr Tietmeyer, the general economic and political environment in which a
central bank operates is the most crucial factor in determining whether it
will carry out its job properly.
'It will be of great importance,' said Mr Tietmeyer in mid-January, 'if and
to what extent the future European central bank succeeds in winning an
independent profile linked to price stability. In contrast to German
monetary union (when the Bundesbank in 1990 took over control of the East
German currency area) the institution which takes over responsibility (in
Europe) will not be one with a well-established track record.
'It will be a question of setting up a new supranational institution which
can rely neither on its own tradition of stability orientated policies, nor
on support in public opinion comparable to the situation in post-war
Germany.'
Mr Tietmeyer's speech is in line with the general German mood of questioning
over Maastricht now emerging into the public spotlight.
Mr Wilhelm Nolling, the mercurial Social Democrat president of the Hamburg
central bank and one of the most outspoken members of the Bundesbank's
policy-making council, went further in a powerful Maastricht critique
published at the end of last month.
Even though the EMU treaty 'fully' took over German ideas on the
independence of the ECB, Mr Nolling warned against 'overestimating' the role
of the future European central bank.
The trust of German public opinion in the Bundesbank had been built up over
years. It could not be automatically transferred to the ECB.
The debate about central banking independence is all the more piquant
because most independent central banks are not doing well in the fight
against inflation.
The Japanese and French central banks, more beholden to governments than the
German and Swiss ones, are chalking up better 'stability' performances than
the Bundesbank and the Swiss National Bank. Even Britain records a similar
inflation rate to Germany's 4 per cent.
Germany's lagging in the inflation stakes has, of course, been keenly
registered by the Bundesbank. But, rather than making the denizens of the
D-mark doubt the value of their own approach to monetary affairs, Germany's
slippage in the stability stakes is prompting the Bundesbank to redouble its
anti-inflationary efforts.
The rise in German inflation, the Bundesbank argues, illustrates that
central banking independence alone is not sufficient to bring down
inflation. But it also emphasises the negative effects which an outside
event - in this case, German reunification - can bring to bear on economic
stability.
Thus, according to the Bundesbank, it underlines the need for a truly
independent central banking body to adopt strict policies to correct these
tendencies.
The Bundesbank is using every opportunity to stress that German interest
rates will remain high until inflation shows persuasive signs of coming down
to its medium-term 2 per cent goal. German, and European, monetary policy is
thus in for a rough ride.
A continuation of German monetary tightness for the next year, combined with
only partial Bundestag ratification of the Maastricht treaty this summer,
could deal a fatal blow to the EMU process.
If, on the other hand, the Bundesbank does succeed, against all the odds, in
quickly correcting the increase in inflation during the next 12 months, and
thus allows German interest rates to fall significantly before long, EMU
backers will also have no reason to rejoice.
In that case, the German central bank will win back its 'stability-first'
laurels - and the German government will be even less enthusiastic about
seeing it replaced by an ECB at the end of the decade.
Either way, the journey to EMU looks fraught with more risks than were
apparent three months ago. Germany holds the key to whether the threatened
road blocks can be removed.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Election win 'will spark UK share rise'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE stock market would rise from current levels by the year-end whether
Labour or the Conservative party formed the next government, according to
research from stockbrokers James Capel.
However, the report says a hung parliament would leave the FT-SE 100 index
around the 2,400 level because of the ensuing political and economic
uncertainty
Initially, the report suggests, a Labour victory would be greeted by a 10
per cent sell-off while a Conservative win would trigger a similar rise.
However, by the year-end the FT-SE would have risen to about 2,750 after a
Labour win, only 250 below the level it would attain if the Conservatives
were returned.
The research, based on replies from 105 of the largest companies in the FTA
All-Share Index, throws up a strikingly different view of the likely
election outcome from recent opinion polls.
More than half the respondents said they thought the Conservatives would be
returned, 32 per cent forecast a hung Parliament and only 6 per cent
expected Labour to form the next government.
An overwhelming 86 per cent of respondents believed that a Labour victory
would be bad for the economy. However, only 63 per cent believed a Labour
victory would be bad for their own businesses.
Altogether 79 per cent of respondents said a Labour government should not
devalue sterling within the ERM but more than half believed it would do
exactly that.
Sectors likely to suffer if Labour is returned would be:
The conglomerates, where stricter regulation of acquisitions is expected;
Consumer stocks, which would be hit by higher levels of personal taxation;
Housing, in spite of higher spending on public projects;
Labour-intensive businesses, as wages would rise due to adoption of the
Social Charter;
Regulated utilities.
While the Labour Party's attempts to woo supporters in the City might have
won over some people, the James Capel survey shows corporate boards remain
wary.
More than two thirds said they would not invest more if Labour persisted
with plans to introduce tax incentives to encourage investment spending. And
59 per cent believed Labour was planning dividend controls.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Sansui in deal to swap equity for loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO companies linked with Macao casino magnate Mr Stanley Ho are to increase
their shareholding in Sansui, the troubled Japanese consumer electronics
group owned by Polly Peck International, the failed conglomerate of Mr Asil
Nadir.
However, the two companies, Grande Holdings and Semi-Tech (Global), have
dissolved an arrangement under which they would have jointly acquired an
interest in Sansui. Instead, they will hold their stakes separately.
The two companies said the cancelling of their previous agreement would
provide them with greater flexibility in monitoring their interest in Sansui
and better suit their respective business strat-egies.
The new arrangement means Semi-Tech will acquire between 19 per cent and 21
per cent of Sansui in return for a loan to the company of USDollars 30m.
Grande has undertaken to provide a loan of USDollars 50m (Pounds 28.4m) as a
requirement of the purchase of its 32 per cent.
Collectively, the two companies will increase their interest in Sansui from
32 per cent to more than 50 per cent.
The amount of equity they will own depends on the outcome of a plan by Polly
Peck's administrator to sell a 49.1 per cent interest in Sansui's Italian
subsidiary, the Imperial Group.
Sansui recently reported unconsolidated losses after tax for the year to
December 31 1991 of Y11.3bn (Pounds 49.8m) and net extraordinary losses of
Y61.9bn.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Letter: A method to determine any bias of risk among Lloyd's
syndicates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A R PLATTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report on the problem of so-called 'insider dealing' at Lloyd's
('Lloyd's inquiry starts as insider row grows', March 5).
It is certainly important to look at the membership of particular
syndicates, in a 'vertical' manner as it were, to see whether this shows
bias. However, it is perhaps even more important to look 'horizontally' at
the spread of syndicates, and especially at the underwriting lines on high
risk syndicates, of individual Names.
That information should then be correlated with the members' agents through
whom the Names underwrote.
A Name's contract with his agent stipulates that the agent is wholly
responsible for the Name's underwriting, without interference from the Name.
It is therefore the agent's job to strike a sensible and safe balance for
the Name, as between risk and reward. A 'horizontal' analysis would show up
whether there is a significant difference between working and external Names
as to the risks they were taking, and whether particular members' agents
were more liable than others to expose their Names (whether working or
external) to undue risk.
Evidence is beginning to emerge, via the Name's Action Groups, that certain
agents may have a very bad record in this respect.
An analysis of this kind is essential if a true picture is to emerge. The
problem relates not only to insider dealing but also to the LMX 'spiral',
since a Name's membership of LMX syndicates is the main factor determining
whether he had excessive risk exposure and will now be bankrupted. Since Sir
David Walker's investigation is to look at insider dealing and the spiral, I
trust he will make a full study of individual Names' risk exposure in
relation both to their membership of LMX syndicates and to the agents who
placed them on those syndicates.
I can illustrate the need for this analysis by mentioning that there are
Names whose underwriting was entirely on LMX, and that there is a large
number of Names who are on several disastrous LMX syndicates. Most of these
people face bankruptcy as a result. It is a highly significant problem.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Unsteady footing at financial summit: Why Mediobanca, the
Italian merchant bank, is in need of new ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's most powerful merchant bank, Mediobanca, is facing a crisis of
confidence. After 40 years at the pinnacle of the country's financial
establishment, serious flaws have been exposed in the strategies on which it
built its success. Even some of its long-standing industrial clients have
begun to question their close relationship with the bank.
Ever since the Second World War, Mediobanca has controlled the levers of
power in Italy's financial and business world. The man tugging on the
handles has been Enrico Cuccia, now, at 84, Mediobanca's honorary chairman,
but still very much in charge.
Mr Cuccia has built Mediobanca's influence on two sets of alliances, at home
and abroad. Within Italy, it has acted as the house bank of the salotto
buono, the family groupings that dominate Italian business, enhancing their
control with ever more complex webs of shareholdings. Elsewhere in Europe,
rather than open its own foreign offices, it has developed close, informal
links with a handful of well-established merchant banks, such as Germany's
Berliner Handels-und Frankfurter Bank (BHF), the UK's S G Warburg and
France's Lazard Freres.
Until now, these twin sets of alliances have reinforced one another.
Mediobanca's dominance at home has increased its usefulness to its foreign
allies; the strength of its international relationships has enhanced its
usefulness to its domestic clients.
Now, this neat pattern is unravelling. In three recent deals, for some of
the bank's biggest clients - the Agnelli family, the Pirelli tyres and
cables group and Generali, Italy's biggest insurer - Mediobanca has
stumbled. Its strategy is running into trouble, at home and abroad.
Within Italy, Mediobanca's dominance is threatened by the passage of
investor protection laws to safeguard minority shareholders and promote
greater transparency in big business transactions. This is a direct attack
on the salotto buono's pattern of secretive pacts between small groups of
shareholders - and hence on Mediobanca, architect of many such agreements.
In the rest of Europe, Mr Cuccia's policy of alliances rather than direct
expansion looks increasingly old-fashioned. The creation of a single
European market and the growth of cross-border mergers and acquisitions have
led the continent's big banking houses to establish wholly-owned
pan-European networks. Informal working alliances are out of style.
The problems created by its failure to establish a wider network of its own
is well illustrated by the most spectacular of Mediobanca's recent setbacks:
Pirelli's defeat in its 15-month struggle to take over Continental, its
German rival in the tyre business. The failure has a number of causes but
neither Pirelli nor Mediobanca, traditionally its principal adviser, emerges
well from the story.
Continental's adviser was Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank bought in
November 1989 by Deutsche Bank - with which Mediobanca has worked closely in
the past. Deutsche Bank's acquisition of Morgan Grenfell was a striking
example of the newly forming pan-European investment banking networks. The
Continental battle was a clear victory for the new era: the combination of
Anglo-Saxon takeover expertise and solidarity among the German financial and
industrial companies which rallied to Continental's defence left Pirelli and
Mediobanca outgunned.
Mediobanca's second setback has come in France, where the Agnelli family,
which controls Italy's biggest industrial group, Fiat, is fighting for
control of Perrier, the mineral water concern. For decades, Mediobanca has
been the Agnellis' closest and most trusted financial adviser. It is not
directly involved in the Perrier bid, and so its prestige is not immediately
at risk. But the stakes are high, nonetheless: the Agnellis look like losing
Perrier to a bid from Nestle, the Swiss food group, backed by Lazard Freres
and other important French banking names. Mediobanca has had to stand
helplessly by as one of its most important clients has run foul of one of
its traditional allies, Lazard Freres.
The third setback came at home, where its L1,750bn rights issue for Generali
last year - the biggest capital-raising exercise by a quoted company in
Italy - prompted unprecedented criticism by politicians and the press. For
years, Mediobanca has been the company's merchant bank; it is also the
biggest single shareholder in Generali, with a stake of almost 6 per cent.
Bankers criticised Generali's rights issue as an attempt by Mediobanca to
reinforce its hold over the company. Suspicions were aroused by the
byzantine structure of the deal, which involved both new shares and warrants
to purchase additional stock in future. Under the terms, voting rights for
those shares not taken up immediately by investors would rest with a
Mediobanca-controlled subsidiary. That could leave Mediobanca controlling
another 20 per cent of the company's expanded share capital.
The storm caused by the Generali deal provoked an outcry in the Italian
parliament. The controversy played into the hands of politicians seeking new
rules to protect small shareholders. Legislation to guarantee minority
shareholders' rights is commonplace in most big industrialised countries,
but only became law in Italy at the end of January.
The new regulations strike at the heart of Mediobanca's use of equity
holdings to cement its dominant position in corporate finance. One of Mr
Cuccia's most famous observations is that shares in Italy are not counted,
but weighed. That refers to Mediobanca's technique of assembling small
groups of shareholders, each owning a fraction of a quoted company, but
whose pooled interests are enough to give them control. Such long-term
shareholder pacts lie behind many of Italy's best-known groups like Pirelli
and Olivetti.
The new Italian laws do not specifically ban shareholders' pacts. However,
the exact status of these agreements is now uncertain, and could soon be
tested in the courts. The new legislation also outlaws the practice of
selling significant stakes in quoted companies at a premium price, one of
Mediobanca's favourite corporate power-broking techniques.
The laws threaten Mediobanca's style of backroom diplomacy, increasingly
anachronistic in Italy's new era of corporate transparency. Its whole style
 -an intense dislike for publicity, a powerful, inbred corporate culture -
may also have been overtaken by events.
Mediobanca has just over 100 professional bankers among its 300 staff, all
based in a single Milanese palazzo. Competitors define them as almost a
'fraternity', professional and dedicated, but prone to arrogance.
'Its staff may be brilliant, but even Mediobanca has to adjust to the new
era,' says a leading Italian banker. 'Merchant banks much bigger and more
powerful than Mediobanca have recognised they must follow their clients
abroad.'
The pressures on Mediobanca are worsened by growing domestic competition.
Dozens of new merchant banks have sprung up in the past five years. Many are
insignificant. But some, like Akros, the highly capitalised merchant bank,
are already licking at Mediobanca's heels. Others, like SIGE, the
Milan-based investment banking arm of the IMI financial services group, can
rely on a steady flow of business from their parent companies. A turning
point may have come last year when SIGE was appointed by the UK government
to be the lead manager for the Italian part of the UK electricity
privatisation. Traditionally, Mediobanca would have expected that role by
right.
It is not too late for the bank to adapt to the new era, building on its
strengths to create a new, less inward looking and conservative institution.
Its chairman, Mr Francesco Cingano, is a respected banker and former
managing director of Banca Commerciale Italiana, the country's most
prestigious commercial bank. He is well regarded, but hardly the breath of
fresh air to revolutionise Mediobanca.
To safeguard its central role in Italian finance, Mediobanca will have to
come to terms with more transparent domestic markets and a new era of
European competition. That may have to wait until the moment Mr Cuccia
surrenders control. To preserve the bank they inherit, Mr Cuccia's heirs may
find themselves dismantling much of his legacy.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Letter: Britain's narrowly educated accountants trail the
international field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER MCGREGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The problem identified by Christopher Lorenz ('The sum total adds up to
more than figures', March 6) is made worse in Britain because our very large
numbers of accountants are much less well educated than those in other
countries.
Only recently have most of them been graduates; even now I would expect very
large numbers of them to have given up science subjects at about 14.
Engineers and others can learn about accountancy at any business school, and
they do. Anyone who has done O-level arithmetic can understand accounting
procedures, if not be an expert on tax avoidance, balance sheet cosmetics,
takeover financing and other attributes which really account for the
dominant position of accountants.
That is due to the continual invention of both Labour and Conservative
governments of new financial traps, tax laws and, occasionally, incentive
grants of allowances involving labyrinthine processes of application.
There is nowhere for accountants to learn about technology. A few years ago
I realised this and ran an experimental Technology Summer School at
Templeton College Oxford, with the college's full support. It was aimed at
bankers and accountants. A group of front ranking scientists in their 30s
was assembled and a programme of introduction to scientific and
technological thinking designed. Hundreds of letters were sent to chairmen,
managing directors, financial directors and others in companies, banks and
accountancy practices.
The first participants were all nominated by a small and select number of
chairmen of their companies.
If the letter got to finance directors or 'directors of human resources',
they tended to reply that 'the school did not meet any of their closely
targeted training needs'. However, we were offering education, not training.
In fact, the school was judged by participants (in response to very detailed
interrogation) to be most successful, but ran at a loss for the first year.
We could not attract sufficient nominations for the second year to make it
pay its way, and the idea was dropped.
Attempts are being made to broaden secondary education. Engineers and
technologists have plenty of opportunities to learn about finance and
economics. What a pity that business schools are not in a position to
broaden the education of our narrow accountants.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Deficit theories pro and anti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unease is already being expressed at the thought of Norman Lamont, the UK
chancellor, adding further to the British budget deficit by cutting taxes.
The argument on the subject will not be between the government and Labour
opposition. For by saying that Labour would borrow 'to build', rather than
to cut taxes, Neil Kinnock has already served notice that he is likely to
accept whatever deficit the Conservative government chooses to run and to
argue that it should be used for public spending instead.
But nor will it do to contrast too crudely John Major's profligacy with
Thatcherite prudence, although there is a contrast to be drawn. The famous
1981 Budget, which raised taxes towards the end of the last recession (and
drove 364 economists to protest) still left a budget deficit amounting to 3
1/2 per cent of gross domestic product, or only one percentage point or so
less than is likely in the coming financial year. Sir Geoffrey Howe, the
then chancellor, accepted (if reluctantly) that budget deficits rose in
recession. His worry was that the pre-recession starting point was far too
high and that a structural correction needed to be made.
The contrast is that after the 1981-82 Budget, the underlying trend was
clearly downwards. Lamont will hardly be able to claim this for the 1992
Budget. Nor can any comparison be made between the two pence cut in the
basic rate in the 1987 pre-election Budget and anything that happens
tomorrow. For in 1987-88 the deficit was known to be falling rapidly and in
the end turned into surplus.
The common sense, financial prudence argument against extra borrowing is
that today's borrowing is tomorrow's taxes. Raising taxes to service the
extra debt will be politically unpopular and cause economic distortions. The
argument applies to every penny of discretionary borrowing and does not
presuppose a 'debt trap' in which the budget is out of control or any other
catastrophe.
The argument for extra borrowing is the old so-called 'Keynesian' one that
it will stimulate spending and thereby help recovery from recession. For if
an active fiscal policy really does make real GDP higher than it otherwise
would be over a period of years, this would be a real gain to offset against
the transfer burden on future taxpayers.
The case against any extra borrowing then boils down to the assertion that
any output gains will be either too small to justify the risk, or temporary
in the sense that they will be lost when the government curbs demand in the
next boom. In that case the extra servicing cost on future taxpayers will be
incurred for nothing.
There is a wise-guy argument why a stimulus would be ineffective. This
argument is known by the pompous title of Ricardian equivalence, but it has
more to do with the contemporary US economist, Robert Barro, than the early
19th century English economist, David Ricardo. This says that taxpayers know
that borrowing will have to be serviced and ultimately repaid, and thus
increase their savings accordingly, starting now. In that case the borrowing
does no harm either. For it makes no difference if government finances
itself by taxes or borrowing.
One would hesitate to stake one's life on the Barro doctrine. For it is
difficult to believe that abolishing taxes altogether, or alternatively,
doubling them, would have no effects for good or ill.
But over moderate ranges Ricardian equivalence has worked better than might
have been expected. The failure of the US budget deficit to have the
horrifying inflationary effect that some predicted and the failure of the
very large British budget surplus in 1988-89 to do much to slow the economy
or offset inflation are points in Barro's favour.
My own doubt is the more straightforward one that a big demand stimulus of
any kind could easily halt or reverse the the progress in reducing
inflation. Even now, inflationary psychology has not been completely
eradicated and past experience has shown how easy it is to stimulate the
economy when it is already about to move upwards.
Why would not the the same objection apply to a monetary stimulus, if the
Bundesbank allowed it? The difference is that an interest rate can easily be
reversed, while something like an income tax reduction, even if it takes the
form of a higher tax starting point, becomes embedded and extremely
difficult to reverse.
Any extra red ink in the Budget needs then to be justified by one of two
alternative criteria. Either the stimuli ought to be rather like monetary
policy in being easily and perhaps automatically reversible. This would
point to indirect taxes and temporary investment incentives rather than
income tax cuts.
Alternatively, they need to contribute to the long-term growth of the
economy, so that some benefit is left even if there is no Keynesian
stimulus. But it is far too simple to equate such expenditure with
'investment' in the Budget accounts. It would be all too easy to translate
Kinnock's borrowing-to-build into higher pay for workers on council
contracts. And there are changes, such as eliminating work disincentives at
the bottom of the income scale or selective spending on, for instance,
science and engineering teaching, which could increase the economy's growth
potential, even though they count as current.
My conclusion would be that some extra borrowing would be justified for
investment, defined very broadly, and not in accounting terms. But this is
not what I expect. The result of tomorrow's borrowing will be little good
and moderate harm. I am much more interested in what happens to interest
rates in Germany.

<TEXT>
Sir, 'Moslems ready to take on Serbs in Sarajevo' (March 4) asserts that
Greece opposes international recognition of an independent state on its
northern border bearing the name 'Macedonia' for fear that this will stir
'Macedonian' nationalism in northern Greece.
Greece fears 'Macedonian' nationalism in Greek Macedonia as much as it fears
'Pelopponesian' nationalism in the Pelopponese, 'Thessalian' nationalism in
Thessaly and so on. That is not the danger.
The real danger lies in the expansionism implicit in the attempt of a small
multi-lingual, multi-ethnic Yugoslav republic artificially created by Tito
in 1945 to usurp and monopolise a historical Greek name and to claim
territories of neighbouring countries under false pretexts.
Rather than providing support for Skopje's absurd and provocative views, we
feel that, in the interests of peace and stability, such articles should
avoid misleading and dangerous terminology.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Letter: A welcome fillip to improve the status of engineers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY SUMNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is disturbing that Britain is alone among 67 nations in the low
respect and status that it accords to engineers. That is a principal reason
why the number of first degree graduates going into engineering and allied
industries has dropped 20 per cent in the last five years. 'Engineers and a
welding job' (February 25) was welcome publicity for the efforts of the
steering group which, with the approval of the 46 institutions representing
engineers, is moving towards a new federal body as the focal point for the
profession.
In his Hugh Ford Management Lecture to the Institution of Mechanical
Engineers, our chairman, Mr Lewinton, recalled how, in the 1970s, the big
accountancy firms pooled their efforts in a marketing campaign that
transformed the social standing and image of their profession.
He called on engineers to adopt a similarly positive approach. We in TI
Group wish the steering group success.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Leading Article: A lottery for good causes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE STOOD the home secretary, ready for his photo opportunity, brandishing
a handful of Pounds 10 notes and looking for all the world like a reasonably
prosperous bookmaker. The image was appropriate. The proposal for a national
lottery, which was announced on Friday, has the marks of a rather seedy
piece of electioneering.
The lottery, according to Friday's white paper, will provide 'a harmless
form of entertainment'. Until 1826, when it was banned, it was 'a
respectable government undertaking, which at one time had the then
Archbishop of Canterbury as a trustee'. That may be a rather partial view of
history: a House of Commons committee, established in 1808, concluded that
'the foundation of the lottery system is so . . . vicious . . . that under
no . . . regulations will it be possible . . . (to) divest it of all . . .
evils'. You do not have to go all the way with these worthies to be critical
of the present proposal.
In the first place, a lottery is highly regressive. All the evidence from
around the world is that tickets are mainly bought by the poor, the
frustrated and those who are falling behind society in one way or another.
Moreover, they are sold on terms which would make a mobster blush.
The government expects that around a third of the proceeds will go on 'good
causes' and another 15 per cent on expenses; what is left for prizes will
then be subject to an as yet unspecified lottery tax. That adds up to a very
negative sum game indeed, and one which even by the standard of lotteries
seems heavily loaded against the player. On one estimate, prizes usually
average around 60 per cent of receipts.
Cultural pursuits
The worst feature of the plan is that the people who pay for it will not, by
and large, be the main beneficiaries. The good causes which the government
has in mind include the arts, sports, the heritage and charities: special
emphasis is placed on improvements to the national heritage 'ranging from
cathedrals through museums to listed buildings from our artistic and
industrial past'. All worthy objects, but all tending to be of most pressing
interest to the more prosperous members of society. The relatively poor
people who will buy lottery tickets will be subsidising the cultural
pursuits of the relatively well off, who will not.
New quango
There is something rather odd about a conservative government proposing the
establishment of a legally protected monopoly, to be administered by a new
quango. Its members will be 'independently minded and have achieved personal
distinction and public standing'. No wonder the various arts and sports
lobby groups are already rubbing their hands in anticipation.
At least the white paper promises that the money raised will not be used to
finance the government's conventional spending programmes. But you can never
be sure. New York established its lottery in 1967 with the profits to be set
aside for education: came a budget crisis, and the money was quickly shifted
into the general fund. The same happened a little later in Connecticut.
Despite all this, the economic and political climate is probably right in
the UK for a lottery system: the home secretary will not be alone in
dismissing its critics as 'party poopers'. Ever since lotteries were used to
rebuild Rome after Nero burnt it down, governments and the public have been
happy to turn to this device at times of slow growth and growing deficits.
But if a lottery is inevitable, let there be some attempt to steer the
proceeds towards the people who will be buying the tickets. One idea would
be to build a network of money advice centres, which could - among other
things - warn people against playing games in which the dice are too heavily
loaded.
If Britain needs to spend a bit more on the arts, which it probably does,
and if the sensible way to fund this is through a hypothecated tax, which it
possibly is, then let the levy fall on those who are most likely to benefit.
A tax on muesli, perhaps, or on designer ice creams.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Backtracking on rail sale: Change of heart over
privatisation plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail's passengers do not want privatisation. Look at it this way,
they argue.
BR is terminally unprofitable. If it is privatised, it will have to start
making money. There are really only two ways of achieving that: raising the
fares, or axeing unprofitable services. Either way, rail users will suffer.
It is not just BR's passengers who are concerned about privatisation.
Communities fear for the future of their transport links. Car drivers want
to keep people on the trains and off the roads. The environmental lobby
presents public transport as a panacea for pollution. Nearly everyone agrees
that railways are A Good Thing.
That, in short, is why ministers have abandoned plans for a 'big bang'
privatisation of BR. One recent opinion poll suggested that more than 80 per
cent of voters see privatisation as a threat to rail services rather than a
boon. With a general election looming, ideology has therefore had to take a
back seat to pragmatism in the quest for a means of fulfilling the
government's privatisation pledge.
It all looked so different just four months ago. Then, Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
transport secretary, had the air of a man in a hurry. No part of the railway
would be untouched by privatisation in the lifetime of the next parliament,
he said. The profitable InterCity and Railfreight divisions would be swiftly
sold off - in InterCity's case, complete with tracks. Services on the
loss-making Network SouthEast and Regional Railway networks would be
franchised to whoever would run them with the smallest subsidies.
But the plans always seemed ambitious. Railfreight, which had good potential
for making profits because it was unburdened by the cost and complexity of
owning its own tracks, might conceivably have sold. But InterCity was far
from making what the private sector would regard as a commercial return, and
its most important route, the London Euston to Glasgow line, was badly in
need of a Pounds 750m refurbishment.
Franchising, too, presented a series of problems. In the absence of any
domestic or international market for used trains, where would franchisees
get their rolling stock? What would happen if a franchisee went bust? What
sort of service would people get from a company serving out the last few
months of a franchise that had not been renewed?
Another feature of the Rifkind plan was on-track competition, at least for
InterCity. But if InterCity owned the tracks, what was to stop it keeping
competitors away by inflicting punitive charges for access? And if a
regulatory body was set up to prevent this, would InterCity's signalmen
simply shunt competitors' trains into the sidings while their own trains
whistled by?
As the difficulties mounted, rival plans began to emerge. Trade and industry
ministers, influenced by the Adam Smith Institute, the right-wing think
tank, said the only way to guarantee proper competition was to separate
ownership of the tracks from the trains - in other words, making railways
like roads or airports. Downing Street backed the ideas of the right-wing
Centre for Policy Studies in seeking a return to the glory days of the
regional companies like the Great Western Railway.
History does not relate what the Treasury made of all this. In all
probability, it was aghast. Proceeds from any form of privatisation would be
tiny; many parts of the railway would have to be fattened up with heavy
investment to make them saleable; and subsidies, far from falling, might
need to rise to enable private sector operators to make a commercial return.
Faced with the intractability of these objections, ministers have finally
decided to do what BR chairman Sir Bob Reid said they should have done all
along: take things slowly. First, private sector trains will be allowed on
to the tracks. Next, BR's unprofitable train services will be franchised out
and the profitable ones sold - possibly in groups, like the former Great
Western services out of London Paddington. Finally, when all the trains are
privately run, BR will end up as a track authority, perhaps to be sold off
to the private sector as an asset-rich blue-chip stock.
One attraction of this solution is that everybody seems to get something out
of it. BR gets a stay of execution; trade and industry ministers get their
track authority; Downing Street gets its Great Western Railway; and Mr
Rifkind can argue that his only serious reverse has been the decision to
split the sale of InterCity's trains and tracks.
And what of the passengers? Inevitably, the package has been designed with
the election in mind. Voters will be reassured with the message that
privatisation - or denationalisation, as it is to be known - will bring the
dawn of a new golden age for the railways.
Whether they swallow it or not is another matter. But their two big concerns
 -fare rises and service cuts - are likely to remain naggingly persistent.
After all, if BR's services are sold to the private sector, then the
government will relinquish control over fares and timetables. If it insists
on retaining that control, then the private sector will not want to buy the
services. No amount of repackaging will make that conundrum go away.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Nigeria's case for help
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S civilian politicians, preparing for the handover from military
rule, should be heaving sighs of relief. General Ibrahim Babangida's
decision to bite the bullet and float the naira may have saved a structural
adjustment programme which was in serious trouble. A large devaluation would
not have been a happy start to Nigeria's return to civilian rule next year.
But what the president is up to is, as yet, impossible to decipher: a final
thrust for reform; the last flail of a tired leader; or a clever ruse to
fool the international financial community? Hope springs eternal, but
experience counsels caution.
The government's intention, of course, is that floating the naira, and so
closing the widening gap between the official and market rates, will lead to
an agreement with the IMF and a subsequent rescheduling of Nigeria's Dollars
30bn of external debt. The economic case for such relief is compelling.
Nigeria's huge debt burden, with notional debt service payments consuming 60
per cent of export earnings, makes development impossible. The country
desperately needs to free resources to invest in its crumbling
infrastructure.
Yet Nigeria's creditors should be sceptical. The exchange rate crisis
reflects the weak government management of the past year. The exchange rate
differential has grown because inflation has accelerated to an annual rate
upwards of 30 per cent, fuelled by high domestic credit expansion to fund a
growing budget deficit as public spending ran out of control.
Tough controls
There is no point in throwing more resources at Nigeria unless the
government can prove that it is serious about reform once more. The exchange
rate can only be prevented, when floated, from collapsing if this
devaluation is combined with a tight monetary policy and tough controls on
public spending. The governor of the central bank last week reaffirmed the
federal government's commitment to 'fiscal restraint and public sector
rationalisation', with expenditure to be targeted only on 'priority projects
that can be satisfactorily completed by the end of 1992'. But promises are
not enough. Until they are backed by a precise plan of action, the IMF and
the creditors should bide their time.
To be specific: are grandiose and economically unviable projects such as the
Ajaokuta steel plant and the proposed aluminium smelter to be stopped; or
will Nigeria's roads, telephones and schools crumble while oil revenues
continue to prop up the politicians' pet projects? Is the fiscal base to be
widened so that public spending can be met from taxes rather than by
printing money; or will the government continue to subside domestic petrol
at the absurd price of US 4 cents a litre, while turning a blind eye to
large-scale smuggling of fuel to neighbouring countries and widespread
evasion of customs duties?
Internal monitoring
Only when these questions have been answered satisfactorily should a new IMF
agreement be signed. The truth is that the Babangida administration, which
started so well when it launched its economic reform programme in 1986, has
over the past 12 to 18 months given structural adjustment a bad name. His
government must now show that the recent mismanagement and siphoning off of
state funds is over. Nigeria desperately needs greater internal monitoring,
as well as external scrutiny, of its economic affairs.
Only then would Nigeria's creditors have reason to believe that debt relief
will speed development and ease the suffering of Nigeria's citizens, rather
than be dissipated by politicians. The forthcoming presidential elections
may tempt the western creditors to offer a combination of debt reduction,
debt rescheduling and new lending to encourage reform. But these should be
offered only on the condition that the government can agree to, and keep to,
tough conditions laid down in a new IMF agreement. Without fiscal discipline
and closer monitoring, Nigeria's structural adjustment will fail, and the
current misery of much of the population of Africa's largest, and the
world's 13th poorest, country will continue.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Arts: As You Desire Me - New End Theatre, Hampstead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is a genuine rarity that gave me a great deal of pleasure: an almost
totally forgotten play by Pirandello that has the master's touch and at
times fairly crackles with suspense about what is real and what is not.
As You Desire Me was written in 1930 and last performed in London in 1948.
It is set in a mixture of Berlin and northern Italy, 1928, when the scars of
the first world war were still deep and it was still too early to predict
with certainty that the Weimar republic contained the seeds of the second,
though I must say that in his scenes of German decadence, Pirandello came
remarkably close to seeing the way the country was going.
Cia, or the 'unknown woman' as she is normally referred to, is a dancer in a
sleazy German cabaret. She is the mistress of a German writer, whose crazed
daughter is as infatuated with Cia as he is. She has forgotten her past
because of the devastation of the war. Then an Italian friend of her husband
turns up, asking her to go home. The German lover shoots himself, but not
fatally. The rest of the play moves to the Italian family villa in Udine.
I shall not go further into the plot because I do not want to give away the
suspense. Suffice it to say that it revolves around whether Cia really is
the missing wife. On one level, of course she is, but the point is that she
has changed and is not the same person she was 10 years before, when dragged
away by the troops and officers at the end of the war. Here we are on
familiar Pirandello territory: what is real and what is an illusion? It may
not be the best piece he wrote, but it is the real thing: no imitator could
have done it.
Some of the vignettes are superb: the performance of the crazed daughter
(played by Janet Steel), for example. So are some of the physical details: a
mark on Cia's leg that may or may not have been deliberately removed. The
suspense is intellectual: note the sudden chill when the German lover,
arriving in Italy, seems to have proved through female psychology that Cia
is not Cia after all.
The production in the tiny New End Theatre seemed to me slightly
under-rehearsed. It began nearly 20 minutes late, had two intervals instead
of the one that was billed, and there was some fluffing of lines. The acting
is uneven, sometimes even by the same character. Ruth Kettlewell as the old
aunt, for instance, frequently looks and speaks as if she was born to play
Miss Marple; at other times she is curiously wooden. The women, on the
whole, are better than the men.
Cia is played by Sandra Fox. This is a magnificent part, including the
cabaret dancing, and with a little more rehearsal it should be a magnificent
performance. Even now it is thoroughly gripping. The direction is by Derek
Wax and one can only salute the enterprise in unearthing the play and
producing a new translation by Kate Nelson. It runs at Hampstead until March
29 and it deserves more.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Arts: British pavilion pulls it off - Architecture / Colin
Amery pays an early visit to Expo '92 in Seville
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The problem is a difficult one. How does an architect design a pavilion
that, in one bold gesture, symbolises the spirit of a nation and conveys a
memorable message to the world? At Expo '92 in Seville, the architects
Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners have pulled it off.
All the best buildings are built around one clear idea. The idea behind the
British pavilion was to bring the sound and presence of moving water to the
dry, hot island of of La Cartuja. This is right for Seville, where
temperatures in high summer can sometimes reach as high as 49`C (120`F). It
would have been easy to design another fountain or a leafy courtyard, but
Grimshaw decided to make the whole front of the pavilion a wall of moving
water. The architect has been able to achieve this wonderful effect with the
brilliant collaboration of the sculptor William Pye.
The British pavilion is sited at the head of the avenue devoted to European
Community members' pavilions. The design is clear and rational; the
architects have taken care to avoid any elements of 'Disney' and razzmatazz.
Visitors approaching from the east will see a crystal box some 25m high, 70m
long and 40m wide. The whole entrance facade is a cascade of falling water
rushing over the glass wall into a wide moat. Two 'curtains' of water mark
the entry point, which is a narrow bridge passing over the blue waters of
the moat (I did wonder whether this relatively small entry point will cope
with the anticipated millions of visitors). Once the visitor has crossed the
bridge, he will emerge into an enormous glass exhibition hall that is
strongly reminiscent of views of the interior of Sir Joseph Paxton's Crystal
Palace of the 1851 Great Exhibition - the source and origin of the idea of
universal expositions.
The structure of the pavilion is an example of the most recent techniques of
steel and glass assembly. Every element was designed and made in Britain,
the parts shipped to Spain and erected on the site in the short period of 42
weeks. This 'kit of parts' approach is very much Grimshaw's trade mark, and
at Seville he seems to have simplified things so that the high-tech elements
seem to be more under control than in some of his British buildings. The
main steel structure is supported on deep piles driven some 18 metres into
the sediment of Cartuja island. Some of the wall and roof trusses are 25
metres long and they had to be escorted by the Spanish police on their
six-day lorry journey from the port of Santander in Northern Spain.
It is the east wall that everyone will remember. It is made of panes of
glass suspended from stainless steel brackets and in front of the glass is
the continuous waterfall designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and William Pye. Pye
is best known for his two water sculptures, 'Jetstream' and 'Slipstream'
that passengers pass on the way to their flights at Gatwick's north
terminal. Water for the Seville cascade is pumped by solar-powered pumps
from the pool at the base of the building to some 1,400 nozzles at the top.
These nozzles are adjustable so that the effect can be varied from a slow,
slithering creeping effect to a thundering cascade. Some three million
litres of water is kept moving constantly. Water is brought right inside the
pavilion over a gleaming stainless steel weir to provide a vast apparently
still reflecting pool. The whole effect is undoubtedly a tour de force.
Apart from the visual beauty of the moving water, I was impressed by the
sound it makes. Outside, it has a cool and calming effect. Once you are
inside the pavilion, the sound makes you feel as though it is permanently
raining (perhaps this will reinforce foreigners' views about the British
climate). I was told that despite the intense heat of a Sevillian summer
there will always be enough water to ensure that the 'biggest water wall in
the world' (to quote the publicity material of the pavilion's sponsors, the
Department of Trade and Industry) will flow until October. I suspect it will
be a hard job to prevent exhausted visitors from taking a refreshing dip.
Inventive efforts have had to be made to ensure that the whole pavilion is
cool. The most exposed west wall demonstrates a completely new technique. It
is made of steel freight containers which are lined by an impermeable
membrane and filled with water. This thick wall of stored water will absorb
heat and should work to keep the interior cool in the same way as thick
masonry walls ensure that medieval cathedrals are always cool in summer. Of
course there has to be some mechanical air handling and cooling and one of
the problems of the whole Expo has been to find ways of avoiding the raising
the temperature of the site that would occur if all the pavilions expelled
hot air into the atmosphere.
The flat roof of the British pavilion has had to be protected from the
extremes of the summer sun by shading louvres that also ornament the
roofline. On these louvres are 150 panels of solar cells that provide the
power for the water pumps. These solar cells and pumps will be used to
provide power in 150 villages in the Third World after the pavilion is
dismantled.
The only element of rampant nationalism about the British pavilion is the
giant Union Flag that can be seen through the water wall - and the water and
flag do evoke a sense of a maritime nation. (The theme of the Expo '92 is
'Discovery', as the whole event is a commemoration of the explorations and
discoveries that began with Columbus in 1492.) The designers of the interior
of the pavilion are RSCG Conran Design and their brief has been to arrange
exhibits that will help the visitor to discover Britain.
Moving on giant travelators and escalators, and escorted by 'Navigators',
the visitor will see video sculptures, an electronic tapestry composed of
275 screens giving a variety of images of Britain. There is a large theatre,
and displays on the top floor look at the scientific development of the four
elements.
But the pavilion itself is the main exhibit, and it is the element of water
that visitors will always remember in all its moving splendour.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Arts: A trend towards the multinational approach -
Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This will not be an easy year for arts sponsorship in the UK. Some large
companies, such as Shell, are cutting back on their help for the arts;
others, such as BP, are freezing their expenditure. Few are actually axeing
what are still minute sums of money in the corporate budget, but the years
of expansion are over.
Even well-established and successful arts projects, such as the annual
regional tour by the Royal Shakespeare Company, are on the point of
cancellation because no sponsor can be found. The tour has been livening up
parts of the UK other arts institutions never reach since 1978, with
Hallmark, NatWest and most recently BT picking up the bill in return for
hospitality and promotional opportunities.
But, in January, BT told the RSC that, after four years, it was switching
its support to Northern Ballet. The RSC has quickly approached the 40 most
likely sponsors, but without success. The sponsorship costs Pounds 185,000,
but for that a company gets 33 weeks, including seasons at Stratford plus
touring with Richard III, visiting small towns from Cornwall to Scotland.
There is only a month left for a sponsor to be found before the arts suffers
its first major casualty of the recession.
*****
Arts sponsorship may be freeze-framed in the UK - although the Association
for Business Sponsorship of the Arts reports that all the money available
under its Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme is still being snapped up by
keen new sponsors - but there is growing interest in multinational
initiatives.
Funding a European tour by an orchestra, or a visiting arts exhibition,
gives sponsors wonderful opportunities to meet key politicians and business
contacts in potential export markets. Nomura Securities picked up important
commissions from the Czech and Hungarian governments thanks to introductions
forged from its support of the National Theatre's recent tour to those
countries.
Now CEREC, the organisation representing national arts sponsorship
associations and based at ABSA's HQ in London's Docklands, has come up with
the first guide to the tax situation for sponsors in 17 leading European
countries. The 62-page booklet Business Support for the Arts in Europe is
available from CEREC or from the sponsors, and authors, accountants Arthur
Andersen.
The quick summary reference offers the eye catching facts that Greece is the
only country reviewed where sponsorship is not a deductible business expense
and that in Spain (because of the Olympics, the Expo in Seville, etc), there
is a 30 per cent tax deduction for donations during 1992.
The booklet estimates expenditure on arts sponsorship in various countries,
ranging from Pounds 57.2m in the UK to FFr650m-700m (Pounds 66m-71m) in
France and DM250m-300m (Pounds 87m-104m) in Germany. The figures for the
Netherlands are Fl 150m (Pounds 46m) and for Ireland, IPounds 2m (Pounds
1.8m). The variations in tax assessment between sponsorship and donations
are outlined and the position of foreign companies mentioned.
This wealth of information is essential for companies considering
pan-European sponsorship campaigns. Some sponsors fail to take advantage of
tax breaks on their expenditure. They are doing themselves, and the arts, no
favours in foregoing such benefits.
This free booklet, nicely timed before 1993, when a surge in pan-European
sponsorships is anticipated to celebrate the single market, should be an
essential aide-memoire.
CEREC has also commissioned research into why companies undertake European
sponsorship. Not surprisingly, it concludes that most companies sponsor on a
haphazard project-by-project basis, with the main advantage reckoned to be
the kudos gained by being seen by peer businesses as a 'European' company.
Then comes the ability to gain access to overseas politicians, in particular
the influential executives at European institutions in Brussels and
Strasbourg.
*****
Our television detectives seem to have taken to drink recently. Inspector
Morse keeps going thanks to the sponsorship of Beamish stout and Maigret is
supported by Kronenbourg lager. Both brands are marketed in the UK by
Courage, which has committed itself heavily to film sponsorship.
Its television links are close to advertising, but it is also prepared to
invest in film as an art form. It stumped up Pounds 30,000 to enable Nomad
Pictures, formed by two young marketing men with film school links and using
young actors and student technicians, to produce Augustine, about a young
mental patient in a 19th century French asylum. As well as seeking brand
awareness from its credits on the film  - and encouraging young talent -
Courage used the inexpensive project to test the waters of the film
industry. It is now contemplating investing Dollars 3m in a full length
movie, House of America, in which it will have an equity stake as well as a
promotional spin-off.
*****
Kallaway, the sponsorship consultant, has picked up two new assignments. It
will manage for Morgan Furze, part of IDV, its Baileys SummerStage series of
12 open air classical music concerts in the grounds of English country
houses, and it will also look after the Munch exhibition at the National
Gallery in November, which is being sponsored by Norsk Hydro to the tune of
Pounds 250,000 plus.
*****
The Cleveland Orchestra will be playing at this year's Salzburg Festival,
and the London Proms, courtesy of the communications company, Ameritech,
which is putting up Dollars 1m over the next three years. This also brings
the orchestra to Salzburg in 1994 and perhaps 1995.
Ameritech's subsidiary Ohio Bell has long been a supporter of the orchestra,
but this is the first time that it has attracted a major backer outside of
Cleveland. Its biggest local sponsor is BP America.
*****
IBM is behind one of the largest arts sponsorships ever seen in Ireland  -
IRPounds 450,000 to enable the National Gallery in Dublin to take a show of
Old Master paintings from its collection to the US.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Arts: Gidon Kremer - Queen Elizabeth Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beyond his worldwide career as a soloist, violinist Gidon Kremer has been
running his own chamber music festival in tiny Lockenhaus (Austria) for ten
summers now, and on Thursday he brought some regular colleagues with him to
the Queen Elizabeth Hall under this new label.
Their music was Messiaen's Quatuor pour la fin du temps and Schubert's great
Quartet in G, D887; the friends were the clarinettist Sabine Meyer (once a
famous bone of contention between Karajan and his Berlin Philharmonic) and
the pianist Oleg Maisenberg, just for Messiaen, and three notable young
strings for Schubert. Though Kremer led both works, he was at pains neither
to domineer nor even to show off a little. He simply applied himself to the
ensemble music with intense sympathy, and immensely polished technique. And
so did they all.
Composed and premiered in a prisoner-of-war camp, Messiaen's seminal Quatuor
wears its heart - and its devoutly Catholic soul - on its sleeve, but with
less calculated flamboyance than much of his later music. The rapt, angular
dance movements are swift, but hardly virtuoso stuff (Kremer's team were if
anything a bit mild with them). The real challenges are in the hypnotically
slow solo movements, where any fault in the elevated line will be cruelly
exposed. Kremer and the cellist Clemens Hagen sustained their twin
'Louanges' faultlessly, and in the 'Abme des oiseaux' Miss Meyer's
bated-breath pianissimo and subtle rhythmic spring were astonishing.
The Schubert quartet was a marvel of lucidity, but it should have been more.
Doubtless in the interest of delicate precision, Kremer &amp; co. (Hagen,
Annette Bik - another original member of the Hagen Quartet - and Catherine
Metz) mostly chose tempi at the bottom end of the plausible range and stuck
to them. Everything - everything, including every possible repeat - had a
lovely, silvery ring, at considerable cost to the black dramatic thrust of
the whole work. If its most jagged junctures don't sound disruptive and
dismaying, one isn't hearing it properly.
Of all performers, it was odd of Kremer to let that be smoothed away. I
wondered whether he wasn't deferring too modestly to the Hagen ethos: those
young Salzburg players made their name early by precocious, ultra-educated
assurance, but they have never been gutsy - which is what this last Schubert
quartet absolutely requires.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Economics: The search for confidence boosting measures in
Lamont's Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN BRITAIN the week will be dominated by the Budget. Tomorrow, at around
3.30pm Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will rise to deliver a speech that,
in all probability, will launch the campaign for the general election,
expected now on April 9.
Tax cuts totalling Pounds 2-4bn have been widely tipped with speculation
focusing on a 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax. Despite the
government's need to break ahead in the opinion polls, a tax cutting package
of more than Pounds 4bn would upset the financial markets. But with scant
evidence to suggest an upturn in the economy, analysts will be looking for
confidence boosting measures in the Budget to spur ever cautious consumers.
Tomorrow is also Super Tuesday - a big day for US politics with several
presidential primaries on the same day. A bad result for Mr Bush will
indicate the depth of the electorate's dissatisfaction over the
administration's handling of the economy.
However, retail sales figures for February are expected to increase
marginally, with the growth probably coming from a pick up in auto sales as
well as household fixtures and building products in line with January's
surge in home sales. Furthermore, the week's producer price data for
February should reflect a favourable outlook on inflation. In January the
producer prices index fell by 0.6 per cent on the year, to its lowest rate
since January 1987.
There is also news on retail sales in Germany this week with January's
figure expected to show a slight decline on the same month of 1991.
According to research by Midland Montagu the squeeze on real disposable
incomes from the mid-year 7.5 per cent tax surcharge, rising inflation and
high interest rates have begun to dampen consumer demand after last year's
very buoyant sales.
Highlights of the week ahead, with the median of city forecasts in brackets
from MMS international, a financial information company, include:
Today: UK, January credit business (net repayment of Pounds 75m): Canada,
January motor vehicle sales, January housing starts, December wages and
salaries.
Tomorrow: UK, Budget presented to parliament, January producer prices index
 -input (up 0.3 per cent on the month, down 0.5 per cent on the year),
output (up 0.3 per cent on the month, up 4.4 per cent on the year),
excluding food, drink and tobacco: US, Super Tuesday, presidential primaries
in Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi,
Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Texas, January wholesale trade,
revised figures for fourth quarter productivity: Japan, January machinery
orders. Canada, fourth quarter manufacturing capacity utilisation.
Wednesday: US, January housing completions: Japan, February trade balance
(Dollars 8.7bn surplus).
Thursday: UK, February CBI distributive trades survey: US, February retail
sales (up 0.7 per cent on month), excluding automobiles (up 0.4 per cent on
month), February M1 (Dollars 20bn), M2 (26bn), and M3 (24.1bn), for week
ended March 2 M1 (flat), M2 (Dollars 0.3bn, and M3 (Dollars 8bn), initial
claims for week ended February 29 (445,000):Germany, first round of
engineering wage talks with Hessen IG Metall: Australia, February employment

year), January trade balance (DM3.5bn surplus), January current account
(DM1.4bn deficit), fourth quarter GNP (down 0.5 per cent on the previous
quarter), February wholesale prices index (up 0.2 per cent on the month):
Spain, February consumer prices index (up 0.4 per cent on the month, up 6.5
per cent on the year): Sweden, February unemployment rate (3.9 per cent),

RESULTS DUE
BTR is expected to report lower annual pre-tax profits on Wednesday, but
most interest will focus on how the industrial conglomerate is digesting its
latest acquisition, Hawker Siddeley, the engineering group which it bought
for Pounds 1.55bn in November after a bitterly-contested takeover battle.
BTR is unlikely to give anything away about possible disposals, but analysts
will want to hear what the enlarged group has to say about its trading
outlook. The impact of recession is expected to have cut last year's pre-tax
profits from Pounds 966m to below Pounds 900m.
As the world's largest mining group, the RTZ Corporation could not be
expected to escape the problems associated with recession in the US and the
UK and present low metals prices. Analysts expect the group to report on
Thursday a fall of about 35 per cent in net attributable profits for 1991.
This would take them down from last year's Pounds 507m to between Pounds
295m and Pounds 340m.
Most commentators suggest RTZ will maintain its dividend payment at 19.5p
because an increase to, say, 20p, would send out the wrong signals
aboutprospects for the currentyear.
Standard Chartered Bank will announces on Wednesday pre-tax profits of
Pounds 200m-Pounds 220m, a marked improvement on 1990's Pounds 150m after
heavy provisions. It has had relatively few lending problems in the UK other
than to Brent Walker, while its Asia Pacific region had a good year and is
thought to have made a strong contribution. Last year's 20p dividend at is
expected to be maintained.
Hillsdown Holdings, the food manufacturer, should turn in 1991 pre-tax
profits of around Pounds 182m on Wednesday, down a fraction from Pounds
191.2m a yearearlier. A final dividend of around 6.4p, up 7 per cent, is
expected.
Poultry will again peck away at group profits, contributing only Pounds 28m
(Pounds 59.4m) with a small loss in the UK offset by profits abroad. On the
positive side, its Canadian subsidiary Maple Leaf has performed well.
Encouraging developments include the recent purchase of Unigate's poultry
business which should help bring rationalisation to the industry and an
upturn in Hillsdown's profits this year to around Pounds 235m.
United Biscuits is expected to report on Thursday a small increase in 1991
pre-tax profits to Pounds 205m from Pounds 197.7m. Given the group's
confidence in its long term prospects, the final dividend could be raised 3
per cent to 9.4p.
McVities biscuits and Terry's chocolates have held their own but KP snack
foods have been disappointing. Bright spots last year were the growing
European operations and the Keeblerbiscuit business in the US.
Saatchi and Saatchi, feeling the pinch of the recession in advertising, is
likely to report tomorrow on Tuesday a loss of around Pounds 50m for the 15
months ended December. This will included provisions for unused office space
and restructuring costs.
BM Group, the industrial holding company that recently acquired Thomas
Robinson, is expected to have increased pre-tax profit by about 27 per cent
to more than Pounds 17m in the six months to December 31. It reports
tomorrow, Budget day.
While Robinson will not figure in the results, Blackwood Hodge, the
construction equipment distributor acquired in late 1990, will be in for the
full six months. The scything of Blackwood's overheads and the boost its
overseas network will have given to the sale of BM's products help explain
the group's resistance to recession.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Motor trade executive Richard Barber has received his reward for turning
round Dovercourt Motor Company, part of Lonrho's many-sided motor activities
which include the import and distribution of Volkswagens and Audis in the
UK.
Barber, who turned Dovercourt from a heavy loss-maker into an earner of
Pounds 250,000 profits last year - after just 24 months of his ministrations
as managing director - has been made chief executive of Dutton Forshaw,
Dovercourt's immediate parent.
A 16-year veteran of motor retailing, Barber is aiming to bring to other
dealer outlets in the multi-franchise Dutton Forshaw group some of the much
increased emphasis on customer satisfaction which turned Dovercourt's
Volkswagen/Audi outlet in St John's Wood, London, into the group's flagship
dealer and sharply boosted sales at the three other London dealerships.
With the Volkswagen group planning to take over from Lonrho the
import/distribution of Volkswagens and Audis after the current import
agreement expires at the end of next year, Barber's responsibilities are
also likely to include looking at wider business opportunities for Dutton.
Barber's place at Dovercourt is being taken by Chris Hayden (left), who
until now has managed Dovercourt's Battersea dealership.
Meanwhile, far to the north, Alexanders Holdings, the biggest Ford main
dealer in Scotland, has appointed former Ford UK managing director Roger
Humm as executive vice-chairman. Alexanders, still investing heavily in
expanding and upgrading a number of outlets despite profits more than
halving last year, says Humm is only the first of a number of new directors
it expects to appoint this year.
The urbane Humm, 54, astonished the UK motor industry world when he resigned
the Ford managing directorship abruptly in October 1990. Although his
resignation did not formally take effect until the end of that year, Ford
announced that he had taken leave of absence with immediate effect.

Retix, a Californian company specialising in networking systems that enable
otherwise incompatible computers and software to talk to each other, has
chosen Gareth Buchanan-Robinson to be managing director of its non-US
activities, Retix UK, which covers Scandinavia, Benelux, the Middle East,
and Africa as well as the UK.
For the past two years he had been in charge of Retix General International,
a subsidiary now merged into Retix UK.
Buchanan-Robinson, a 35-year-old Englishman, who also speaks Italian, is
poised for an aggressive marketing push within Europe of the so-called Open
Systems Interconnection products of which Retix claims to be a leading
supplier.
'We expect Retix to become a Dollars 200m corporation by 1995,' he says.
Sales last year amounted to Dollars 60.5m.
An economics graduate from Aston University, Buchanan-Robinson does,
however, have a record of sales growth. In his previous capacity at Retix,
he claims to have increased turnover by 60 per cent in the space of 12
months; he was previously international sales manager at an Eastman Kodak
subsidiary, International Systems Corporation, where he also presided over a
rapid expansion. Previous employers included Norsk Data Computer Systems,
where he helped set up subsidiaries in Germany and the UK.

<TEXT>
TAYLOR WOODROW has won a Pounds 35m contract from British Coal Opencast for
extensive mining, civil engineering and restoration work at two disused
collieries at Swadlincote, Derbyshire.
In Derbyshire, Taylor Woodrow is starting work on winning more than two
million tonnes of coal by open-cast methods at two former mines at Cadley
Hill and neighbouring High Cross on the A444 route south of Burton-on-Trent.
A major part of the contract involves constructing a one kilometre dual
carriageway at High Cross after coal extraction has been completed. Due to
be finished early in 1995, the roadway, which will serve as a bypass for the
village of Castle Gresley, will comprise a bridge and elevated roundabout
complex, spanning the main road and rail line.
Some two miles north, at the former Cadley Hill colliery, Taylor Woodrow
Civil Engineering will be undertaking a six-year programme to extract coal
and prepare the 128 hectare site for industrial and leisure development.
This will involve diverting a main sewer around the perimeter of the site as
well as grading and compacting the land. A coal-washing plant will be used
to reclaim a 160,000 tonne pre-war coal tip.
Taylor Woodrow Civil Engineering is undertaking similar coal recovery
operations in a derelict colliery site at Abercynon, mid-Glamorgan, and at
its open-cast coal site at Garnant, Dyfed, before restoring the land for
industrial and agricultural use.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MILLER CIVIL ENGINEERING, a member of the Miller Group, has won contracts
with a total value of nearly Pounds 46.5m.
The largest is for the first phase of the Black Country route (pictured
right), a 2.7 kilometres dual carriageway joining Darlaston Lane in Walsall
to Junction 10 of the M6. The contract, let by Walsall Metropolitan Council,
was won in competition at Pounds 31.5m.
Considerable ground treatment is involved, including the infilling of old
mine workings and the removal of some contaminated land. Within this stretch
of the route there are two main interchanges, two overbridges, five
underbridges and a diversion culvert for the Darlaston Brook.
Within the structures Miller will use 14,000 cu metres of concrete, 3,000
tonnes of reinforcing steel and 750 tonnes of structural steel. Also
included in the work are 14 reinforced earth retaining walls and 10 crib
walls involving 6,200 sq metres of brick faced panels, 150,000 cu metres of
backfill and 220,000 sq metres of geotextile reinforcing.
The road will require 480,000 cu metres of imported material and 85,000 sq
metres of black top. The contract is due to take 130 weeks and starts at the
end of April.
In the north west at Dalton in Furness, Miller has started work on the new
bypass for the Department of Transport, a contract valued at Pounds 8m and
lasting 94 weeks.
This bypass project comprises 3.5 kilometres of 10 metre wide single
carriageway, with three overbridges, three roundabouts and a box culvert,
and geotechnical work.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Management: Spreading the word on not being quoted - A look
at a company that discovered freedom when it went private
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the last four months, Swraj Paul has been free. He has also saved more
than Pounds 100,000.
Since November 7 last year when he withdrew Caparo, his medium-sized
engineering company, from the stock exchange, life has been simpler and more
prosperous.
Paul estimates that the loss of his listing will save Pounds 500,000 in a
full year - equal to some 3 per cent of the company's profits. Fees alone
for the teams of PR men and stockbrokers to assist in what Paul calls 'the
shenanigans of quoted companies' cost at least Pounds 150,000 a year for the
most basic service. Anything fancy and the fees shot up.
Further large savings have come from moving the accounts department from the
centre of London to Birmingham. Now that Caparo no longer has to be in close
touch with the City, there is no point in being in expensive premises in
London, says Paul.
Another change has been in the sort of employees the company requires.
Finance department staff who concentrate on dealing with the accounts come
cheaper than those whose role includes talking to merchant bankers. Total
saving from the move, including rent, is Pounds 350,000 a year, Paul
estimates.
There are other, non-financial benefits. One is that the company will be
quicker on its feet. 'Before, you were always wondering what the City would
think and your judgments were slowed down.'
The message is clear for all medium-sized companies in old fashioned
industries: a stock exchange listing may not be worthwhile. Paul reckons
that there are many companies that would love to leave the City behind, but
can't raise the money to buy out their shares.
It was only possible for him because a mere 20 per cent of Caparo's shares
were in the market anyway.
The stock exchange typically put such a low rating on his shares - some six
times earnings - that raising money through share issues was more expensive
than borrowing from the bank. Paul makes the time-honoured complaint about
the City being greedy for immediate results.
'Now we can think long term. Two, three or four years is well beyond the
range of most institutions. Yet that is the timetable over which most
investments will pay off.'
When Caparo tried to undertake big investment projects, updating plant and
machinery, Paul found that the City would not wear the heavy depreciation
charges. 'You can only grow by a steady 20 per cent in terms of profit if
you engage in financial engineering,' he says.
A stock exchange quote also has a bad effect on management, he says. 'I like
to see the share price high in the paper. It shifted my priorities away from
the real stuff.'
Paul, one of the most successful Indian businessmen in Britain, regrets the
passing of the old days of trust and decency in the City. The stock exchange
itself has greatly deteriorated, he thinks, with deregulation and Big Bang
creating an atmosphere were 'everyone is trying to do better than their
neighbours'.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Electricity users attack Wakeham over price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL leading industrial users of electricity have accused Mr John
Wakeham, energy secretary, of allowing Nuclear Electric, the state-owned
nuclear generator, to force up prices.
Their attack on the new electricity market will deepen the row about
electricity prices and cause embarrassment for Mr Wakeham in the approach to
the general election.
The electricity users, including Blue Circle, GKN and other large companies,
say they face increases in their electricity bills of between 15 per cent
and 30 per cent because Nuclear Electric, which operates the nuclear
stations of England and Wales, sets the electricity price even though its
share of the overall supply market is only about 20 per cent.
One electricity buyer said: 'We have been throwing our hands up in horror.
It is extraordinary that Nuclear Electric should be allowed to set the
price.'
National Power and PowerGen, the two privatised electricity generators which
have a combined market share of about 70 per cent, signed contracts at
privatisation which oblige them to sell two thirds of their power to
domestic consumers. That leaves Nuclear Electric dominating the industrial
market.
The row about Nuclear Electric's role deepened last week when Mr Wakeham
failed to persuade the company to offer large consumers more electricity at
lower prices. Nuclear Electric trimmed prices slightly, offering contracts
at 2.425p a unit of electricity plus inflation - which brings the price to
between 2.5p and 2.6p - compared with the 2.62p it offered at the end of
last year.
'That is still a huge jump,' said Mr John Topliss, chairman of the
electricity group of the Major Energy Users Council, which represents large
energy consumers. He pointed out that the price in the pool, or wholesale,
electricity market for the past year has averaged only about 2.2p.
Mr Topliss said: 'You are talking about an increase of close to 20 per cent,
which is not justified by any rise in underlying fuel prices. Nuclear
Electric are second-guessing National Power and PowerGen, who have been
talking up the price.'
Mr Ian Blakey, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Association, which
represents many steel companies, said his members expected increases of
between 15 per cent and 16 per cent. He explained that, although basic
energy prices were rising by between 20 per cent and 30 per cent, the total
electricity bill included other charges which would rise by less.
There is little Mr Wakeham can do without being seen to interfere in the
free electricity market. One council member said: 'We think he is very
anxious to meet our concerns, but he hasn't any idea how.'

FT  09 MAR 92 / Architects urge policy change for housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S architects say that the country faces a dramatic housing crisis
and that its transport system is in chaos.
The Royal Institute of British Architects urges changes in government
policies on housing, transport and the environment in its paper An Agenda
for the Nineties, published today.
'The housing needs of many members of society are not being met,' it says.
The paper says public expenditure on housing has fallen 60 per cent in real
terms over the past 10 years. Local authority house-building has fallen from
86,000 units in 1980 to 13,000 units last year. Housing associations built
17,000 houses last year compared with 21,000 in 1980.
It calls for a national housing policy to establish the extent of housing
shortages, the areas where new housing is required, and the type of housing
needed.
Local authorities should be allowed to spend a far greater proportion of
capital receipts from the sale of housing and land on building new homes, it
says. Leading financial institutions should be encouraged to play a part in
the private-rented sector.
'Adequate standards of housing for all sectors of the community are an
essential human right. It should not be left to the market to determine the
nation's housing mix on the basis of the best possible return on site
value.'
The paper says that a balance must be struck within the next generation
between private and public transport, and road and rail. 'More road building
is not the solution to the problem of traffic in town and cities. Without
efficient public transport towns and cities will be condemned to terminal
decline,' it says.
Some further selective investment will be needed in motorways and trunk
roads but there is no case for introducing toll roads, it argues.
Railways are the most effective means of mass transportation and a target
should be set for the transfer of freight from road to rail, the paper says.
But more public investment and subsidy will be needed to maintain and
improve rail services. 'Privatisation will not ensure an improved railway
network.'
The paper, which says that architectural competitions should be held for all
major buildings, attacks government proposals to introduce compulsory
competitive tendering for local authority architects' departments, deriding
the 'assumption that the cheapest architect will provide taxpayers with the
best value'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor may be disappointed if he is counting on tax cuts in this
week's Budget to fuel a strong recovery in high-street spending, according
to a survey.
Asked what they would do if they received a cash windfall such as a tax
rebate, 37 per cent of consumers said they would take a holiday, while 14
per cent said they would pay off debts. Only a third said they would use the
money to buy clothes or home furnishings.
The survey, conducted by Gallup for IPC Magazines in the middle of last
month, found that half of consumers saw no end to the recession, while a
third said it would last at least another year.
In spite of the recession and falling property prices, a fifth of the sample
considered their homes as the top spending priority at present, though twice
as many said food was the single most important item.
Asked what they would spend money on first once the recession ended, almost
a third said holidays and a quarter said their homes.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Stance on Scotland may cloud Lib Dem message
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGE in Britain's political system and economic revival were set at the
centre of Liberal Democrat aspirations for the general election yesterday by
Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader. But he risked clouding his party's message
with a complex stance on the issue of 'home rule' for Scotland.
Rallying his party at its spring conference in Glasgow, Mr Ashdown
confronted accusations that a Liberal Democrat vote is a wasted vote. 'Never
before has the ground for political change been so well prepared,' he said.
On the economy, he warned that 'the Tories offer paralysis and Labour offer
timidity.' He called for public investment, an independent central bank -
and hinted that he would reverse any tax cuts in tomorrow's Budget.
He welcomed moves by Labour in the direction of including moves towards
proportional representation in its manifesto. But the party should go
farther, 'bite the bullet' and come out unequivocally in favour of reform.
In spite of the obvious passion of Liberal Democrats at Glasgow for Scottish
'home rule', the party's MPs have agreed it must be subordinate to Mr
Ashdown's top priority - electoral reform at Westminster. Some MPs have had
to be persuaded to toe the line, notably Sir David Steel, the former Liberal
party leader who made only a very brief appearance at the conference. With
devolution bounding up the Scottish political agenda, the strength of the
deal to subordinate Scottish aspirations has been tested to the limit. Mr
Malcolm Bruce, Scottish spokesman, admitted the party was only 'half way'
towards persuading voters why Scotland would not have a guarantee of its
rights under a devolved system until Britain had a fair and representative
democracy.
Liberal Democrat MPs in Scotland feel glee at the way in which the 'home
rule' dream that drove many of them into politics in the 1960s and 1970s
could start to become a reality in five weeks. Their delight is an emotion
that could threaten the party's cohesion if Mr Ashdown sought to vote down a
minority government offering devolution but not full-blown constitutional
reform.
Yet Mr Ashdown knows the Liberal Democrats' appeal has to be broader based
if he is to make an impact in the constituencies in the south-west and
south-east of England where the Alliance parties - from which the Liberal
Democrats were forged - came second to the Tories in 1987.
The Scottish MPs do not need special concessions. In all but one of the
constituencies, the main challenger is the Conservative party, not Labour or
the Scottish nationalists.
Scottish 'home rule' is far down the list of voters' priorities in Liberal
Democrat target seats such as Bath, Falmouth and Camborne, Richmond and
Barnes, or Cheltenham. Mr Ashdown's tactics for capturing such seats are
broader and softer focused, based on simple messages about changing the
Westminster political system, of building on voter apathy or disenchantment
with negative Labour and Tory campaigning.
The party's My Vote slogan, splashed across a giant orange sun over the
conference platform, is aimed at encouraging voters to make every ballot
paper count. Party political broadcasts will list all the 259 constituencies
where the Liberal Democrat is the main challenger to the MP.
'Ours will be the vote which breaks the logjam holding back change in our
country . . . My vote is for an election which is positive,' read the
introduction to Mr Ashdown's speech.
That message will be emphasised at grassroots level with Liberal Democrat
policy papers crammed with neat ideas or 'common sense' solutions to
contemporary issues - such as the housing shortage or animal rights - that
can be niche-marketed according to local concerns.
Party headquarters in Westminster is lean and professional - a remarkable
turnround compared with the near-bankrupt state of the organisation a few
years ago. But the lesson of past elections is that Liberal Democrat
victories are borne largely of local effort.
Alas for Mr Ashdown, the devolution debate was in danger over the weekend of
disguising the infectious enthusiasm of confident Liberal Democrat
candidates. He risks exacerbating the confusion himself. He appeases home
rulers by talking of the Scottish devolution debate as 'the soft underbelly'
of UK constitutional reform but - apparently in contradiction - says a
Scottish parliament could not become entrenched if a single party at
Westminster could impose the policies that Scotland had rejected.
The hypothetical arguments over what his stance would mean in a hung
parliament - like the fascination over how many cabinet seats Mr Ashdown
might or might not demand - irritate party strategists who believe a
coalition government is a long way down the scale of probabilities.
In practice they fully expect Labour or the Tories to attempt to run a
minority government before calling Mr Ashdown. If the government survived
the Queen's speech debate, Liberal Democrats would vote for any devolution
legislation brought before parliament.

ULSTER'S POLITICAL leaders are expected to concentrate on setting an agenda
for post general election talks when they meet in Belfast today.
Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the Unionist leaders, Dr John
Alderdice, the Alliance party leader, and Mr John Hume, of the nationalist
Social Democratic Labour party, will examine ways of picking up the threads
of the inter-party talks which were shelved last July.
The first stage of these talks is concerned with finding an acceptable
formula for governing Northern Ireland. It is understood the four leaders
are determined not to conduct negotiations through the media and will be
keeping their discussions private.
The British and Irish governments are optimistic that the talks, chaired by
Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, will make progress.
There is speculation that today's session will be adjourned tonight and
recommence after the general election. Once the election is over a meeting
of the Anglo-Irish Conference is expected to announce a formal suspension of
its meetings to facilitate the talks.
Mr Brooke has said that what had been agreed between the governments was
'admirably flexible'.
Later, the second round of the talks will concentrate on relationships
between Belfast and Dublin, before moving on to discuss links between the UK
and the Republic of Ireland.

<TEXT>
A SUBSTANTIAL minority of Scottish companies expect constitutional change in
Scotland after the general election, even though a majority expect the
election will be won by the Conservative party, which opposes constitutional
change, James Buxton writes.
Two-thirds of Scottish companies expect the Tories to win the election,
according to a survey by BBC Scotland and the accountants Pannell Kerr
Forster.
While 48 per cent of those asked do not expect constitutional change, 42 per
cent do expect change.
The survey was based on 136 interviews among the top 200 Scottish companies
in all sectors and a further 100 big privately-owned companies.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Premier hints at possibility of political reform: Shifting
of emphasis in the Chinese leader's attitudes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR THE FIRST first time since the 1989 Tiananmen troubles, a hint of
political change has dawned in China. Li Peng, China's usually hardline
premier, declared at a State Council meeting this month that economic reform
should be 'matched with political reform.'
This follows the initiative launched by Deng Xiaoping, the country's supreme
leader, to boost economic reform, which is currently sweeping the country.
Deng spent time in south China and Shanghai last month praising the 'open
policy' and the capitalist features of the Special Economic Zones. These
SEZs, set up to attract foreign investment, display economic growth far
beyond that elsewhere in China.
Diplomats in Beijing said it was unlikely that Li's remarks meant he was
calling for a more pluralist system. He was more probably referring to the
administrative reforms China had tried to launch in the mid-1980s. But as
one diplomat noted: 'Once this kind of thing is on the agenda, it's likely
to stray further afield, further than the leaders want it to.'
Li's comments are the latest and most important sign yet of reformers in
China's long-running battle with the conservatives.
But the trend had already begun. Towards the end of last month even the
People's Daily, for the 33 months since Tiananmen the chief mouthpiece for a
tough line demanding Chinese-style socialism, switched to urging boldness
and experiment.
Reports have even surfaced of the possible rehabilitation of Zhao Ziyang,
the party leader dismissed because of his soft line towards the
demonstrators in the Tiananmen protests.
One party insider was reported as saying that Zhao, who has been virtually
under house arrest since June 1989, had recently been consulted on economic
policy.
Even the hardliners seem reluctantly to have agreed that economic reform is
required to maintain stability, since growing living standards mean less
discontent. Deng's speeches in the SEZs of the south are now being studied
throughout China, in preparation for the session of the National People's
Congress, the rubber-stamp parliament, later this month.
The evaporation of Marxism-Leninism in the formerly socialist world may have
something to do with this new approach. Deng was probably speaking for all
worried officials when he reportedly noted in Shenzhen, the SEZ adjoining
Hong Kong: 'Everything can collapse very quickly if mismanaged. Did east
Europe and the Soviet Union not crumble overnight?'
Deng has apparently not minced words in his battle against the conservatives
for economic reform. In his speeches reportedly conveyed to the enlarged
meeting of the politburo in mid-February by Jiang Zemin, the party leader
and Deng protege, he declared: 'Some comrades have opposed opening up right
from the start ..not just once, but consistently.' All this year the Hong
Kong Chinese press, which often has excellent contacts inside China, has
been awash with tales of disputes between him and the old guard.
The elders are fighting for more than their own positions. They plan to
ensure their children will inherit power on their demise since they can
probably be trusted to continue the party line.
Many hold key jobs in the hierarchy, unsurprisingly in a society where the
concept of family holds sway. As the conservative patriarch Chen Yun said a
few weeks ago, 'the children will not pull down the monuments of their
parents.'
Chen Yun's son, Chen Yuan, is a vice-governor of the People's Bank of China,
the central bank. Wang Zhen's son Wang Jun is a director of the key China
International Trust and Investment Corporation. Deng's own children are in
top positions, with a son-in-law controlling a major part of China's arms
sales.
More than half the potential central committee candidates (to be elected at
the forthcoming party congress) are the offspring of high-level officials,
the 'party of princes,' as the Hong Kong Chinese press ironically calls
them.
This does not mean they share the political views of their parents
(foreigners who have met them believe they are more liberal than the
previous generation) but they are certain to support the power of party rule
since it confers privilege.
The leaders, Deng included, draw a sharp distinction between economic and
genuinely political issues. But since all the previous bursts of economic
reform have been followed by rising political demands, it remains to be seen
whether Beijing can successfully ride the tiger.
The leader of far west China's predominantly Moslem region has announced a
crackdown on worsening 'sabotage and subversive activities,' according to an
official report, AP reports from Beijing.
Tomur Dawamat, chairman of the government of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region,
voiced fears held by Chinese leaders that the break-up of the Soviet Union
and independence for its former republics would encourage China's own
restive minorities, most of whom live in remote, border areas. 'The
changeable international situation has affected and is still affecting
Xinjiang's social stability,' Tomur said.
Xinjiang borders the newly independent republics of Kazakhstan, Kirghizstan
and Tajikistan, and many Xinjiang residents share the same culture, language
and blood ties with residents across the border.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Tokyo tries to halt further fall in yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government, having begun the year fearing that a strong yen
would spiral ever higher, was yesterday contemplating new ways of bolstering
a surprisingly weak yen that is showing signs of becoming even weaker.
Officials at the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan gathered to
discuss the currency's weakness and indicated that the central bank may buy
the German mark this week in an indirect attempt to strengthen the yen by
undermining the US dollar.
Tokyo has been bewildered by the course of the currency in recent weeks and
is worried that the yen's weakness, which benefits Japan's export
industries, will fuel an already surging trade surplus and create more
problems in US relations.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan, under political pressure to stimulate the
domestic economy by cutting official interest rates, is having to balance
the timing of the cut with concerns that it could further weaken the yen.
The government has also been confused by US tolerance of the dollar's
strength.
US officials had called for yen appreciation in the period before and
immediately after President George Bush's controversial visit to Japan in
January, when an apparently fragile dollar traded at Y122.
At the time, Japanese executives publicly discussed whether their companies
would be able to cope with Y110 to the dollar, but, instead, the yen headed
quickly in the opposite direction.
Late last week, it was just below Y132 and there was talk on the Tokyo
foreign exchange market that the Y140 level would soon be tested. Dealers
are convinced that the Bush administration has changed its policy priorities
and is happy to see the dollar strengthen in tandem with signs of US
economic recovery.
Mr Tomio Kudo, director of foreign exchange at Meitan Tradition, said that
the yen's turnaround is a result of the breakdown of currency co-ordination
among the Group of Seven industrialised countries.
'There appeared to be international agreement on the need for a strong yen,
but there was no evidence that the US was supporting the Japanese currency,'
Mr Kudo said.
'When intervention didn't come, traders who had positions against the dollar
had to make corrections, and this movement strengthened the dollar.'
Other traders said that the slowing of the Japanese economy and the
surfacing of new political scandals had prompted a international
reassessment of the yen's worth.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, blamed 'speculators' for the yen's
weakness, saying that the present exchange rates 'do not reflect economic
fundamentals.' He said: 'A strong dollar will not help the US increase
exports.'

<TEXT>
THE US has fined six companies a total of Dollars 550,000 (Pounds 312,500)
for violating sanctions against Libya imposed in 1986 for alleged Libyan
terrorism in Europe.
The US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC),
announcing the fines, said this was a 'warning to companies throughout the
world that they may not do business with Libya from or through the United
States.'
OFAC also said the measures underscored the US administration's
'determination in dealing with the terrorist regime of Muammer Gadaffi.'
Among companies named by OFAC were Fina Exploration Libya, a subsidiary of
Petrofina; Security Pacific International Bank; Vitol SA Inc, a Houston
company; Energoprojekt, based in Yugoslavia; Generale Bank in New York, and
Jogobanka of Yugoslavia.
The latest OFAC listings coincide with steps at the United Nations to impose
limited sanctions against Libya over its refusal to hand over to the US or
Britain two Libyans allegedly involved in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet
over Lockerbie, Scotland.
US companies have been banned from doing business with some 60 commercial
enterprises and two dozen individuals regarded as Libyan or
Libyan-controlled.
Malta has not and will not offer to host a trial of Libyans suspected of
blowing up a Pan Am airliner, an official government statement said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Cairo.
'The position of the government of Malta is that it has made no offer to
host any trial. Nor has it any intention to make such an offer,' said the
government statement.
It was clarifying remarks by Maltese foreign minister Guido de Marco, who
Malta would consider a Libyan proposal to allow the two suspects to be tried
on the island 'if the parties involved agreed'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was defeated at an important
by-election yesterday, heightening pressure within the party for Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa to step down as prime minister to appease voters disillusioned with
the scandal-tainted government.
The upper house poll in Miyagi, in northern Japan, was narrowly won by a
trade union candidate backed by the Social Democratic Party of Japan, which
had taken the seat in 1989 when the LDP was troubled by an earlier set of
corruption scandals.
In conceding defeat, Mr Miyazawa said that the party had waged an 'excellent
fight' in attempting to regain the seat, but the result and a low voter
turnout highlighted public disaffection with the LDP.
Opposition politicians said the outcome was a significant victory for them,
and showed that the public wanted reforms of the scandal-prone political
system. Mr Tamisuke Watanuki, the LDP secretary-general, said that 'we
deeply regret' failing to win and will 'do our best to revive public trust'.
Mr Miyazawa had campaigned on behalf of his party, although the local
campaign manager had suggested that it would in the LDP's best interests if
the prime minister stayed away.
The branch had wanted to focus its campaign on local issues, drawing
attention away from the scandals at the party's centre.
The Miyagi area is also an important rice-growing district, and it was
expected that some farmers, traditional LDP supporters, would have deserted
the party or not voted as a protest against the expected liberalisation of
Japan's rice market.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Turkey switches tactics in attempt to join Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY has switched tactics in its bid to join the European Community, away
from insistently demanding early admission and towards a long-haul campaign
portraying Turkey as the new regional power in central Asia and therefore as
Europe's invaluable partner.
Interviews with leaders of the new government this weekend confirmed that
its sights are still set on joining the EC, but that they have more
immediate regional hopes and fears to preoccupy them. Paradoxically, banging
less loudly on Brussels' door and devoting itself more to cultivating its
regional concerns may in the end improve Turkey's still-long-shot chances of
gaining admission to the EC club.
Over time, the EC may become less inclined to look down on a Turkey that is
increasingly being looked up to by the Caucasian and central Asian republics
as their model for achieving democratic capitalism. For all Turkish
politicians, except those of the fundamentalist Welfare party, Community
membership appears to remain the main goal. Even the most distant prospect
of membership has been a spur to improving the country's human rights and
economic performance, the issues on which prime minister Suleiman Demirel
won power last year.
But though Turkey led, in 1987, the latest wave of EC applications, it keeps
being sent to the back of the applicants' queue. Some Turkish politicians
take this very badly, notably President Turgut Ozal who masterminded the
1987 application. He regards the EC's criticism of Turkey's human rights
records as 'a made-up reason why Turkey should not join the EC'. He says
'the real reason is that we are Moslem'.
Mr Demirel professes to be more relaxed, both on the motives and duration of
EC stand-offishness. He dismisses Mr Ozal's anti-Moslem theory. 'We want to
live and breathe in Europe,' he says. 'This is modern Turkey's choice and we
don't care how long it takes'. By contrast, Mr Ozal wants to plunge into the
only possible arrangement on offer from Brussels for the foreseeable future:
a customs union in 1996. Only Turkish textile makers, the EC's largest
supplier and frequent target of its dumping inquiries, would welcome such
free trade. Most Turkish industrialists and ministers quiver at the thought
of the cold blast free EC competition would send through their protected
sectors.
They want some off-setting aid from Brussels, like the EC's Ecu600m (Pounds
426.6m) protocol long blocked by Greece. But speaking to Brussels-based
journalists last Friday, Mr Ozal said: 'Let's have the customs union even
without the financial aid'. However, the following day Mr Demirel gave
another indication that he intends to use the operational powers he has as
prime minister to play a cooler game towards the EC. 'At the moment, I think
it (the customs union) would be beneficial for Turkey, but there are four
more years to go'.
Few leading Turks think that the ex-Soviet republics in the Caucasus and
central Asia offer any economic, let alone political, alternative to the EC.
In unusual harmony, Mr Ozal and Mr Demirel acknowledge the regional
leadership role thrust on their country, but caution that Turkey, especially
without western aid, can only make a modest impact. But Ankara ministries
and Istanbul boardrooms are abuzz with plans for government aid, private
ventures, and university scholarships for their Turkic cousins in the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
It is this wider, eastern strategy of Turkey's which is put at risk by the
fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the likelihood of Turkey siding with
fellow-Moslem Azeris in the conflict. For this reason, Mr Demirel was at
pains over the weekend to dismiss sabre-rattling talk from President Ozal.
There are signs, too, that Brussels is picking up Ankara's idea of a
triangular operation, whereby the EC would lend central Asian CIS republics
money to buy goods from Turkey. The Commission now wants to establish
diplomatic and economic ties with Asian, as well as European, members of the
CIS. If this happens, and if Greece continues to prevent Ecus going to
Turkey, the latter will be, as one EC Commission official noted, 'the only
country between the Straits of Gibraltar and the Sea of Japan not to get EC
aid'. But while Turkey may now have more geo-political worth to the EC, it
still gets little EC esteem for its human rights record. The Demirel
government may now be treating its Kurds better than the previous Motherland
Party government did, and certainly better than Iraq and Iran treat their
Kurds.
The question of any formal autonomy, of the kind that might separate most
Kurds from the militants of the separatist Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), is
still taboo. Mr Demirel still defends other methods, such as the March 1
bombing of alleged PKK camps in northern Iraq, though his Social Democrat
vice-prime minister, Mr Erdan Inonu, concedes one day a referendum on
Kurdish autonomy might be possible.
Turkey's problem with the EC is that it is chasing a moving target, a
Community which keeps setting itself higher sights in terms of political and
monetary union and which, as it enlarges to take in Scandinavians, will
become more, not less, sensitive about human rights. But, says Mr Demirel,
'we do not assume we will never reach the standards of Europe'.

FT  09 MAR 92 / US concern over Argentine missile links to Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is finding it difficult to obtain from Argentina key information
about its Condor missile project, raising concern about the extent of
transfers made to a sister-project in Baghdad that was part of Iraq's
nuclear-capable missile development programme.
In a widely-publicised move last month, the Argentine government handed over
control of the project to the National Commission on Space Affairs, which
reports directly to President Carlos Menem.
At the same time, the Argentine Government made a public commitment that
'all projects with warlike purposes or goals to obtain armaments of mass
destruction' had been 'totally abandoned'.
While Argentina's commitment to non-proliferation does not appear now in
doubt, Western observers believe that the more crucial issue of the Condor's
wider use to Iraq remains unresolved. The US is understood to have been
seeking detailed information about solid-fuel motors and guidance technology
developed at the Condor's production plant in Falda del Carmen, near
Cordoba, and which are thought to have been shipped to Iraq.
The Falda del Carmen site included a parabolic antenna for the transmission
of point-to-point microwave signals that the US believes carried data
between Argentina and Iraqi procurement agents working in a network of front
companies in Austria and Switzerland.
Washington's request for details about Argentina's plans for the Condor
project has been conveyed to Buenos Aires in a series of communications from
officials in the State Department and from others in the Bush
Administration.
Officials in Washington say the Argentine air force has thus far provided
only sketchy information about the project.
The original plans for the project have mysteriously disappeared from Air
Force archives over the past 18 months.
In the words of one western observer: 'The Argentine civilian government
doesn't have records of what went out from the project'.
A State Department official said yesterday that the US had 'an ongoing
dialogue with Buenos Aires' about the Condor missile project. But a US
investigator tracking one portion of the Condor project disclosed yesterday
that 'parts of the US Government have had very good information on the
Agentine-Iraqi links because the US had a deep cover agent working in the
Condor procurement network in Switzerland and Austria'.
The Condor project is thought to have cost Iraq, Argentina and Egypt a total
of Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn)-Dollars 5bn between 1984 and 1991, with
funding coming mainly from Baghdad, technology flows going through Egypt and
Jordan, and Argentina being used as a site for the development of a
prototype and testing.
The Argentine side of the project, which cost an estimated Dollars 800m
(Pounds 454.5m) between 1985 and 1989, officially ran out of steam two years
ago because of lack of additional funds.

SLOVAKIA'S ruling right-wing party, the Christian Democratic Movement,
splintered at the weekend after two powerful leaders left to create their
own nationalist-based party.
The division will further weaken the position of right-wing parties in the
Slovak republic in advance of June's general elections in Czechoslovakia. It
also highlights the growing nationalism pervading all political parties in
the Slovak republic.
Both the Christian Democratics, led by the Slovak prime minister Mr Jan
Carnogursky, and their coalition partner in the Slovak government, ODU-VPN,
support the economic reforms drawn up in Prague and the disputed federal
system in Czechoslovakia. But their popularity has been ebbing as Slovaks,
faced with greater economic hardship than their Czech neighbours, prefer to
back nationalist parties increasingly critical of Prague. The Christian
Democrats agreed to allow Mr Jan Klepac and Mr Wilhem Oberhauser to set up a
rival party based on a more left-wing and nationalist platform.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of a public sector strike in Germany grew stronger at the weekend
when trade union leaders rejected the government's pay offer as 'not worth
discussing' and warned that they would call a strike ballot if there were no
improvement.
The white-collar workers' union, DAG, has announced that it will decide
today on whether to start 'warning strikes' in central and state government
offices, and the OTV, the principal public sector union, did not exclude
protest actions in the key state of North Rhine-Westfalia.
The worsening mood in the 2.3m-strong public sector workforce, which would
pit the unions for the first time directly against the government, coincided
with more hopeful indications from both sides in the banking industry wage
conflict that they may return to the negotiating table.
At the same time there were gloomy warnings about the strained state of the
German economy, rising unemployment, and the need for tougher budget
restraint, both from government ministers and the government's top
independent economic adviser.
Professor Hans Karl Schneider, chairman of the so-called five wise men who
provide the German government with a regular independent economic analysis,
warned that the real level of unemployment would reach 4m this year and
expressed astonishment at the continuing demands of the unions for wage
awards of about 10 per cent.
The public sector unions are demanding a pay increase of 9.5 per cent, and
extra holiday pay, and last week were offered 3.5 per cent by the employers'
side, representing the federal, state and local authorities. At a weekend
rally in Essen, Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, leader of the OTV, said that if
there was no improvement in the offer by the next round of negotiations on
March 19, 'there can only be one answer: a ballot and a strike.'
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, told a state election rally in
Baden-Wurttemberg that wage demands of 9.5 per cent had nothing to do with
economic reality.
The one ray of hope came in the bank dispute. Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief
executive of Deutsche Bank, said in an interview that the employers' offer
of 5 per cent was 'not the last word,' and union leaders said they were
ready to go back to the negotiating table.

FT  09 MAR 92 / The European Market: West hides behind Polish tariffs - Car
makers show protective instincts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLISH manufacturers who have seen domestic markets eroded as a result of
foreign competition never tire of appealing to the government for more
protection.
Lately though their case has been strengthened as they have watched western
car makers exhibiting similar instincts in talks on investment deals in
Poland.
After all, it was GM Europe which asked Poland to introduce a 35 per cent
import tariff on cars as a condition of establishing its joint venture with
Warsaw's ailing FSO plant agreed two weeks ago. And Fiat, which is still
negotiating the purchase of a 51 per cent stake in the FSM plant in southern
Poland, where its new Cinquecento model is being produced, is not averse to
taking advantage of the resulting tariff wall that came in at the start of
the year.
The EC reluctantly agreed to let the Poles raise the duty on cars from last
year's 15 per cent to 35 per cent and included this in Poland's association
agreement which aims to liberalise trade in industrial goods by the end of
the century.
At the same time Brussels insisted that the tariff be gradually reduced to
zero over the next ten years. It also got a duty free import quota of 30,000
cars from EC producers out of the Poles, thus effectively excluding Japanese
manufacturers.
Under the initial agreement with the Poles, GM will assemble up to 35,000
Opel Astra models a year at FSO and will examine the possibility of
producing a new model there to replace the outdated FSO Polonez.
However, much of GM's Dollars 75m investment could well be financed through
increased sales volumes in Poland under the duty free quota. Indeed earlier
talks with GM before Christmas broke up without agreement when the outgoing
Polish government decided that the revenues it would forego by giving GM the
40 per cent of the duty free import quota it wanted would be greater than
the Dollars 75m GM was willing to put on the table.
But the present centre-right government under Mr Jan Olszewski, which is
keen to prove it wants western investment, decided to go ahead, trusting to
GM's assurances that there would be more investment in FSO in coming years.
In January Mr Adam Glapinski, the new foreign trade minister, decreed that
one third of the quota should go to Fiat, a third to GM and the rest to
Volkswagen, on condition that each invested at least Dollars 50m in
production capacity in Poland.
VW is negotiating a joint venture with FSR, a small pick-up plant near
Poznan where it would assemble the Toyota Hi-Lux pick-up now being built in
Hanover.
The quota decision effectively soaked up the market for new imported cars.
Although Poles imported about 300,000 used vehicles from abroad last year,
the number of new models sold in the country through recognised dealer
networks amounted to no more than 28,000.
The decision also raised howls of protest from French manufacturers who had
planned to boost their sales in Poland this year and had spent heavily on
developing retail and service networks. The French government got Brussels
to suspend the car trading clauses in the association agreement pending
talks aimed at getting Mr Glapinski's decision changed. The talks will take
place this month.
Meanwhile Renault is pointing out that it is investing 'over Dollars 50m' in
a retail network with a view to increasing sales in Poland from last year's
1,600 vehicles to an ambitious 15,000 cars this year. Citroen, whose offer
to invest in FSO was deemed less attractive than GM's, is in a similar
position.
Mr Jacques Calvet, chief executive of the Peugeot group which includes
Citroen, said the company was continuing to pursue a joint venture with FSO,
despite the memorandum of understanding with GM.
Peugeot was also negotiating a separate joint venture with FSC, a small van
maker, for the possible assembly of the Peugeot 405 large family car in
Lublin, he said.
Mr Xavier Karcher, head of the Citroen division, said the company was
negotiating with FSO with a view to assembling the Citroen BX in Warsaw as a
replacement for the FSO Polonez in direct competition with the plan by
General Motors to develop an Opel car to replace the old Polish car range.
Mr Karcher insisted that Citroen could still win a deal with FSO for the
more ambitious second stage of the modernisation of the FSO facilities.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Brussels talks to step up Yugoslav peace initiative

MOVES to resolve the Yugoslav crisis will be stepped up today when the
EC-sponsored conference on Yugoslavia reconvenes in Brussels, following the
arrival yesterday in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital, of the
commander of the UN peace-keeping troops.
General Satish Nambiar, an Indian, is expected to finalise plans to deploy
more than 13,000 UN peace-keeping troops in the republic of Croatia later
this month.
Despite the first major breach of the nine-week-old ceasefire in Osijek,
eastern Croatia, in which five people were reported killed at the weekend,
western diplomats yesterday said they expected the deployment to go ahead.
In Brussels, the presidents of Slovenia and Croatia, and the four presidents
of the rump Yugoslavia, are today due to discuss the recognition of the
republics of Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia. Both republics voted for
independence in recent referendums.
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic may not attend the talks because of
slight injuries received in a car accident, Tanjug news agency said.
Greece continues to oppose the recognition of Macedonia on the grounds that
Macedonia has claims on part of northern Greece, while nationalist Bosnian
Serbs, who boycotted the referendum in Bosnia-Hercegovina, want to remain
part of the Serb-dominated rump Yugoslav federation.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, president of Bosnia, will again ask the EC to
recognise the republic's independence. But Moslem officials said at the
weekend that some EC countries now suggest Bosnia should be administered on
ethnic lines, with considerable autonomy granted to the Croat, Moslem and
Serb communities.
Croatia and Serbia also support the division of Bosnia into cantons in the
belief that this would speed up the eventual disintegration of the republic
and its eventual unity with both Croatia and Serbia. Western diplomats
yesterday said the UN, and some other EC countries, oppose this plan.
Mr Franjo Tudjman, president of Croatia, has already succeeded in having Mr
Miro Lasic, a moderate Bosnian Croat who wants to preserve the territorial
integrity of Bosnia, dismissed from a special tripartite committee of
Moslems, Serbs and Croats. This committee is negotiating with the EC on the
future status of the republic.
Slovene officials want the EC conference to open up negotiations on tackling
Yugoslavia's Dollars 16bn (Pounds 9bn) external debt. Mr Marko Krajnac,
vice-chairman of the central bank of Slovenia, said all six republics must
decide how the debt should be distributed among the republics, so as to
facilitate fresh credits.
Much of the federal debt is already accounted for, except for Dollars 3.5bn,
which is unallocated debt. 'We have to reach a settlement on this soon. But
so far, the National Bank of Yugoslavia (the central bank) has not been
willing to discuss it,' Mr Krajnac said.
Slovenia's share of the allocated debt of the Yugoslav federation is about
Dollars 1.8bn.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Compromise on tied-aid rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has forged a
compromise over the transition to tough new rules intended to stop aid funds
being mixed with commercial loans to help exporters win contracts.
The compromise, which emerged last week, is expected to defuse a row between
the US and Spain over two unusually large Spanish credit lines to Mexico and
Venezuela which were rushed through before curbs on mixing aid with
commercial credits came into force on February 15.
At the same time, efforts by the OECD to get member states to report
outstanding unused tied credits have achieved little success. Just six of
its 24 member states have disclosed their aid 'overhang', none of them
leading users of tied aid. No replies have been received from Japan, the UK,
France, Italy, Germany or the US.
OECD efforts to eliminate 'mixed credits', in which governments cheapen the
cost of loans for projects in target markets by mixing aid funds with pure
commercial credits, have made significant progress. Rules that came into
force on February 15 limit tied aid to projects that are not commercially
viable. They also ban the use of tied aid for loans to better-off developing
countries - defined as those with gross national product per capita of
Dollars 2,465 (Pounds 1,400) or more in 1990.
The controversial Spanish credits were seen as an abuse of both principles.
The credits, of SDR723m (Pounds 567.55m) to Mexico, and SDR650m to
Venezuela, were among the five largest credits ever notified to the OECD,
and compared with total Spanish aid in 1990 of Dollars 800m.
The compromise agreed this week will not force Spain to withdraw the credit
lines, but their lives will be strictly limited. They can be assigned to
projects - even those that are seen as commercially viable  - up to December
31 this year, and must be notified to the OECD by then.
The special transition rules for other existing unused tied credits will
allow countries to notify projects to be funded by these credits up to
August 15 this year. Tied credits are normally valid for two years after
signature. Under the new rules, it will not be possible to prolong them.
Up to August 15, it will be possible to use these credits even in countries
with per capita GNP above the agreed threshold. But for the rest of the life
of the credit, it can be used only for non-commercial projects.
The aim of the changes is to boost aid flows to the world's most needy
countries, and into non-commercial but important projects.

FT  09 MAR 92 / Mulroney fears US will delay accord on free trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OTTAWA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NORTH American free trade agreement (Nafta) between the US, Canada and
Mexico is unlikely to be in place this year, according to Mr Brian Mulroney,
Canada's prime minister.
Mr Mulroney said in an interview with the Financial Times that the Nafta
negotiations were going 'quite well' and may be completed this spring. But
he had 'serious doubts' whether the US Congress would have either the time
or the inclination to ratify the agreement before this November's elections.
Mr Mulroney blamed the protectionist mood in Congress and the isolationism
favoured by some candidates in the US primaries for a lengthening list of
disputes between the US and Canada.
In the past week, Washington has imposed curbs on Canada's two biggest
exports to the US, cars and lumber. 'This has nothing to do with trade
policy,' Mr Mulroney said. 'It has everything to do with politics.'
The Canadians are especially angry over Washington's decision to deny
duty-free access to Honda cars assembled in Ontario, and a Commerce
Department ruling last Friday that Canadian softwood lumber exports are
subsidised by low tree-cutting charges in provincially-owned forests. A 14.5
per cent countervailing duty has been imposed on lumber shipments.
Canada is expected this week to consider retaliatory measures against US
exports. 'We are their biggest market and their best customer, so we won't
sit idly by and allow low-level functionaries to exercise retribution and
harassment', Mr Mulroney said.
Ottawa also plans to refer the Honda and lumber issues to bilateral dispute
settlement panels set up under the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement.
These panels have become the Mulroney government's most powerful argument
against domestic criticism that the FTA has failed to provide Canada with
secure access to the US.
'Had it not been for the free trade agreement, we would have been as dead as
doornails in the American market in this hostile climate,' Mr Mulroney said.
'What you have is a colossal volume of trade which is shielded from needless
hostility.' Two-way trade between the US and Canada was about Dollars 200bn
last year.
Mr Mulroney said that he, President Bush and President Salinas de Gortari of
Mexico would hold a telephone conference call next Monday to discuss
progress in the Nafta talks.
Some of the most intractable issues are not directly related to trade. They
include Mexican immigration to the US, Mexico's energy, environment and
labour laws, and Canadian concerns about automotive investment.
Mr Mulroney said Canada remained committed to the Nafta, partly to protect
the gains it made in the bilateral FTA, but also to ensure that it was
included in any future moves towards a western hemisphere free trade zone.
Mr Mulroney added that the US and Canada had an obligation to encourage
economic development in countries such as Mexico, which are moving towards
both economic and political liberalisation.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Misery Index cheers Major
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Misery Index, which adds the unemployment rate, expressed in percentage
terms, to the rate of inflation, fell steadily last year, aided primarily by
a fall in inflation from 9 per cent in January to 4.5 per cent in December
1991. The index is now on the rise as unemployment is growing.
Some commentators view the Misery Index as a guide to the election prospects
of the party in government. On this basis, the index bodes well for John
Major, since despite being on the rise it is still lower than in June 1987,
the time of the last election. Inflation then was 4.2 per cent and
unemployment, 10.1 per cent.

FT  07 MAR 92 / What price the old school tie now?: The FT-500 schools
survey, out today, is the widest analysis of private education yet
published. Full and controversial details in out special supplement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER its social cachet, the old public school tie is no longer a
reliable guide to top-notch academic performance. Eton, Winchester and
Westminster vie with the leading independent grammar schools in Birmingham,
Portsmouth, Chester and Manchester for the top slots in the FT-500 survey of
independent schools. Famous names languish far below: Rugby 94th,
Marlborough 108th, Lancing 178th, Stowe 271st.
Ties apart, the FT survey shows single-sex and day schools largely
outstripping their boarding and co-educational partners, and a poor
relationship between fees and results at all levels.
The FT-500 survey of independent schools, published today in a special
supplement, is the most comprehensive analysis of the private education
sector yet published. It includes almost all institutions belonging to the
Headmasters' Conference and the Girls' Schools Association. It features a
ranking of schools by all A-level results, not just top grades. But it is
far more than a league table: a mass of information is given on each school,
from fees to teacher: pupil ratios and broad subject specialisation.
To that extent, readers can make their own estimate of 'value added.' The
tables are arranged by county, with a separate listing for Scotland.
Our survey shows the top 50 independent schools in England and Wales
(Scotland's separate exam system prevents direct comparison) achieving
outstanding academic results. The top 50 secured an average A-level grade of
'B' or higher and/or the point-equivalent of at least three passes at grade
'B'. In the country as a whole, only 27 per cent of passes were graded 'A'
or 'B' last year.
Among the next 200-odd, competition is fierce, with A-level results good and
tiny gaps separating school scores. Differences between them have more to do
with fees, facilities and ethos than rankings in the exam scoreboard. At the
bottom, however, about 60 institutions turn out poor or indifferent academic
results. Some have compensating strengths, but many face an uncertain
future.
It should come as no surprise, then, that the independent sector's grip on
the leading universities is so tight. And tightening. The proportion of
Oxford university's admission for this October coming from independent
schools is up from 48.2 to 48.6 per cent - while the state sector, which
educates three-quarters of the nation's sixth- formers, has to make do with
42.8 per cent (the rest were mostly from overseas). Three-quarters of next
year's Oxford entrants gained at least 2 'As' and one 'B' at A-level. At 14
independent schools the average A-level score per pupil was thereabouts or
higher.
Father Dominic Milroy, headmaster of Ampleforth and chairman of the
Headmasters' Conference, told his fellow HMC heads recently of his
'suspicion of the invasion of education by the language of the market'. A
school leaver was neither a client nor a finished product - comments on
which he elaborates in an interview in the supplement.
In reality, however, he or she is both, so far as a school is concerned. The
corollary is equally clear. As Martin Stephen, Headmaster of the Perse
School, Cambridge, puts it: 'We have to look very hard at ourselves, work
out clearly what it is we are offering that is worth Pounds 3,600 a year,
and then make sure that parents and pupils know what it is.'
What is it, then? Stephen had no doubt: high-quality teaching and results,
first and foremost; but discipline, facilities and extra-curricular
activities - sporting, musical and cultural  - not far behind.
Developing and marketing such wares is now the preoccupation of the typical
independent school head. Some go about it more energetically than others.
David Pardey, an educational marketing consultant, tells his clients that
the first essential to selling a school is 'SWOT analysis': an audit of the
Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats within a school, leading to
a 'marketing plan' complete with targets and strategies. SWOT or not, most
schools are doing it all the same.
The strengths of particular schools are not always clear from the FT-500
table, since facilities and extra-curricular activities are missing. It
nonetheless offers some interesting correlations between what you get and
what you pay for.
First, results bear little relation to pupil-staff ratios. Across the
sector, schools are generally within the 8:1 and 14:1 range. But most day
schools are nearer the 14, whatever their A-level performance - which puts
them not far behind the 15:1 average for state secondary schools. It may be
that the typical private school teacher is more committed than his or her
state counterpart; but it is selectivity, buildings, equipment and
extra-curricular activities, not more staff, that most parents are paying
for.
Typically, 60 per cent of a school's budget goes on teaching staff, and the
impact is clear when comparing fees and staff ratios in day schools. It is
less evident among boarding schools. Taking five boarding schools with fees
of around Pounds 11,000 a year at random, the pupil:teacher ratio is 9.3:1;
selecting five with fees around Pounds 7,500 yields a ratio of only 9:1.
There is, therefore, no straightforward link between what you get and what
you pay for: neither in terms of results, nor of facilities (given the
unequal endowment of institutions). The FT-500's three top schools, all day
grammar schools, have fees of around Pounds 3,300 a year; the day fees of
their more prestigious 'public' counterparts like Winchester, Westminster,
Shrewsbury and Charterhouse lie between Pounds 7,000 and Pounds 9,000. True,
of the top 20 boarding schools, 15 have fees higher than Pounds 9,000 a
year, while of bottom 20, 14 have fees lower than Pounds 9,000. Yet average
fees in the top four schools taking day pupils are only three-quarters as
high as those in the bottom four to do so.
The tables might also lead you to question another piece of conventional
wisdom: that if only the state system would pull up its socks, private
schools would be the preserve of 'snobs and eccentrics,' as Labour's
education spokesman Jack Straw puts it. Consider Kent. It has clung on to 28
grammar schools, and has one of the highest state-sector university entrance
and achievement rates in the UK. Yet it also sustains 26-plus independent
secondary schools and, according to the tables, most are far from
high-flying. By contrast, comprehensive Avon and Lancashire manage only 19
and 22 respectively. Even if state schools improve, a substantial private
sector is with us for the forseeable future.
There is, at all events, no political threat to it - certainly not from
Straw, who is these days as likely as Kenneth Clarke, education secretary,
to be the star speaker at gatherings of independent heads. If anything, the
threat to the sector comes not from independence, but excessive dependence
on the state. The assisted places scheme, set up by the government a decade
ago to pay fees for children from low-income families, now pays all or part
of the fees of 7 per cent of private pupils. It has become bread and butter
for a significant minority of schools. Our survey shows the dependent to be
mostly the big city day schools - and the likes of Dulwich, Manchester and
Newcastle grammars could fill their places without them. But a fair few are
less favourably placed, and if Labour cuts their lifeline later this year,
expect to hear cries of woe - or worse.
By then, they may have been brought on by the recession anyway. Stories of
retrenchment, redundancies - even pupils being withdrawn  - are legion,
particularly among boarding schools, for whom demand is falling steadily.
But all schools face difficulties in deciding whether or not to meet a state
teachers' pay settlement at twice the rate of inflation. A study earlier
this year by Monmouth School revealed almost two-thirds of its parents as
having pre-tax salaries of Pounds 40,000 or less. There may not be much fat
left.
Rationalisation is starting: Malvern College, facing declining rolls and
little prospect of improving them in rural Worcestershire, is about to merge
with both a local girls' school and a prep school - giving it a tied-entry
and co-education in one bound. Joint ventures with local businesses to
improve sports facilities are common; so are commercial activities in the
holidays. Marlborough is marketing a summer school offering more than 70
courses from art, Anglo-Saxon and architecture to woodcrafts.
However, private schools are concerned not only about the recession,
marketing and investing in marketable facilities: relations with the state
sector are also a high priority. Even without assisted places, other changes
are working to blur the state/independent divide more than at any time since
the end of the direct-grant regime: the national curriculum; pupil testing;
changes to teacher training, which will allow private schools to take state
trainees; a new inspectorate likely to embrace both sectors. Across the
trenches, local management of state schools, plus a near-certain increase in
real state school spending, are set to make the private sector's
independence and privilege appear ever less exceptional.
'We are moving into a new era,' says Father Dominic Milroy. 'The whole trend
is towards a mixed system: public and private working together, and parents
mixing as never before.' Who knows, a few years hence it might seem quaint
to publish tables comprising only schools which charge fees.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Turkish threat to cut off Armenia: Nagorno-Karabakh conflict
may extend beyond former Soviet borders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKISH president Turgut Ozal yesterday threatened to block landlocked
Armenia's export route to the Black Sea in an effort to 'scare the
Armenians' into abandoning their fight for the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Mr Ozal, in an interview, stopped short of saying that troops from Turkey's
army, the second largest in Nato, should be reinforced along the border with
Armenia.
However, he called on any Russian troops remaining in the disputed enclave
to help keep the peace, or take their weapons with them when they left. Mr
Ozal said he had information that the Nagorno Armenians were arming
themselves from Russian depots.
Nagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan, but its mainly Armenian population
wants to be united with Armenia.
The Nagorno-Karabakh dispute, forcing Turkey off the fence and on to
Azerbaijan's side, threatens to extend the conflict beyond the borders of
the former Soviet Union.
The dispute also threatens to mar the prospect of peaceful Caucasian and
central Asian co-operation developing around a diplomatically even-handed
Turkey, which is the most successful capitalist state in the region.
Mr Ozal said there was growing Turkish public feeling - which he clearly
backs - that the government of prime minister Suleiman Demirel 'must do
more' to help the Azerbaijanis, with whom Turks identify on cultural,
linguistic and religious grounds.
Mr Ozal's comments came as Azerbaijan's president Ayaz Mutalibov resigned
after the nationalist opposition charged him with weakness in the conflict
with Armenia.
Mr Mutalibov agreed to go after an all-night siege of the parliament by
thousands of angry demonstrators who claimed he had failed to defend
Azerbaijani lives and territory in the fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh.
Last week at least 100 Azerbaijanis were killed by Armenian guerrillas
fighting for control of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Mr Mutalibov's resignation is likely to trigger an escalation of the already
fierce fighting between Azerbaijani forces and Armenian guerrillas, and
possibly a more isolationist stance within the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS).
Azerbaijan has been a recalcitrant member of the CIS and its parliament may
yet decide not to ratify membership of the fragile organisation. This could
push Azerbaijan even closer to Turkey, which it sees as a model for a
secular state.
Mr Mutalibov's departure will also probably speed up moves to create an
Azerbaijani army. One of the criticisms against him was his failure to set
up quickly a republican army, as parliament had requested, to rebuff
Armenian attacks.
Mr Ozal expressed concern at Mr Mutalibov's resignation, describing him as
'quite a conciliatory man'. He said that he understood Mr Mutalibov's
successors were 'hardliners'.
Mr Ozal acknowledged he had told a business group earlier this week that the
time had come to 'scare the Armenians a little'.
An underlying element to these words is the fact that he and the prime
minister, from different parties, have had difficulty co-habiting
politically since last year's elections.

modelled on building society branches - will offer taxpayers a 'one-stop'
point of contact for dealing with their tax affairs under plans for a
fundamental reorganisation of the Inland Revenue published yesterday.
The shake-up - which has been endorsed by ministers  - could reduce the
Revenue's workforce of 67,000 by as many as 10,000 over 10 years.
Unions representing tax staff fear that thousands more jobs could be at risk
through the contracting out of routine clerical work. Revenue managers have
commissioned feasibility studies into contracting out 30 per cent of jobs as
part of the government's 'Competing for quality' programme.
Under the plans, routine Revenue work will be concentrated in a limited
number of large 'service centres' - perhaps as few as 20. These centres will
handle routine clerical and administrative work such as the issue of tax
assessments and the processing of tax returns. Greater use of new technology
is planned, including optical character recognition equipment to read tax
returns.
Pilot service centres are to be launched later this year in Birkenhead,
Leeds, Norwich and Walsall.
Individual taxpayers will be able to discuss all aspects of their tax
affairs through town centre 'taxpayer assistance offices'.
Senior Revenue managers see such offices as 'welcoming but not lavish',
using on-line computer links to access the computers which store tax data.
The review says that tax staff in such offices should be given 'the
information, the technology and the authority to respond to taxpayers'
inquiries quickly and accurately; and, where appropriate, the authority and
capacity to make decisions and amend records'.
'This is the new Inland Revenue,' said Sir Anthony Battishill, chairman of
the Inland Revenue Board. 'Our vision is a department in which for all
routine tax matters taxpayers have to deal with only one Revenue office and
preferably a named person.'
A network of specialist offices would deal with the more complicated tax
affairs of the self-employed. They would also be responsible for chasing up
non-payers and investigating tax evasion.
Among the options under consideration for simplifying tax assessment and
collection is an extension to the self-employed of the 'pay and file' system
used for corporation tax. Self-employed taxpayers would have to submit their
own assessment of what they owe together with payment of tax, for subsequent
scrutiny by tax inspectors.
Another option would be to end the practice whereby an employee's PAYE tax
affairs are handled by the tax office which deals with the employer.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Major to defend economic record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR will today set the stage for the most closely fought British
general election since 1974 by launching a vigorous defence of the
government's economic record.
With a final draft of his party's election manifesto completed late on
Thursday, the prime minister will tell a Conservative local government
conference in London that the average citizen's lifestyle has improved
immeasurably over the past 13 years.
His stress on increased prosperity since the Conservatives took power will
be backed with figures showing the sharp rise in numbers of young people
taking up places in higher education and the spread in ownership of consumer
durables.
But Labour yesterday seized on BT's plans to cut 25,000 jobs to put rising
unemployment under the spotlight in the run-up to next week's Budget.
Senior opposition frontbenchers called on Mr Major to take 'the urgent
action necessary' on training, jobs and investment. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow
trade secretary, said 125,000 jobs had been lost since the new year, and
independent forecasts showed 400,000 more were at risk.
Mr Major's speech to Tory councillors is not intended to herald the election
campaign. The election date is now thought likely to be announced on
Wednesday and the prime minister's rallying call to the party is expected to
be made to the Tory central council at Torquay next Saturday.
Ministers last night welcomed new figures showing a sharp reduction in
Britain's current account deficit last year to its smallest annual shortfall
since 1987. But City economists were treating the figures warily, claiming
the revision from a provisional Pounds 5.8bn to Pounds 4.4bn was the result
of 'unsustainable' features.
A frantic week of pre-election manoeuvring ended with the Tories releasing a
256-page dossier, entitled Who's Left?, detailing what they claim are the
leftwing political affiliations and statements of Labour MPs. Labour branded
it as 'dirty tricks' and 'muckspreading'.

FT  07 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ends lower in choppy
trade after jobs data

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK prices closed lower in choppy markets yesterday while bond prices
ended the day higher after volatile trading following the release of
unexpectedly strong employment statistics, writes Martin Dickson in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 3221.6, down 19.9, while the
broader Standard and Poors 500 index was at 404.43, down 2.08. The Nasdaq
composite index of over-the- counter stocks ended at 615.95, down 6.02.
On the New York Stock Exchange, declining stocks led advances by 1093 to 599
on volume of 186m shares.
Market sentiment was set by the much-awaited figures for February
employment, released early in the morning, which showed non-farm payrolls
rising by 164,000 - far greater than Wall Street had been expecting. The
concensus was for a rise of just 10,000. There was also an impressive gain
in hours worked.
Analysts said the news suggested a significant pick-up in the economy and
pretty much ruled out the chances of a further easing in monetary policy by
the Federal Reserve over the next few weeks.
The figures prompted a sharp drop in Treasury bonds, the benchmark 30-year
issue hitting a low of 99 25/32 in morning trading. However, bond market
anxiety about a pick-up in the economy was tempered by the statisticians'
revision to January employment figures, showing a decline of 149,000 rather
than 91,000.
Treasuries also encountered buying when the yield on the long bond passed
through 8 per cent. In late trading the benchmark issue was quoted at 100
7/8 , up 16, to yield 7.916.
Most actively traded stocks included International Business Machines, down
Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 86 3/8 , USX-Marathon, Dollars 22 5/8 , up Dollars
3/8 , Limited Inc at Dollars 27 1/8 , down Dollars  3/4 , and Exxon at
Dollars 55 5/8 , unchanged.
Bank stocks fell for the second day on market concern over the finances of
Olympia &amp; York, the property developer owned by Canada's Reichmann family,
which has redeemed part of a commercial paper programme after a downgrading.
Chemical Banking, one of the most actively traded issues, was down Dollars
3/8 at Dollars 31 1/8 , Citicorp down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 16 1/8 and
BankAmerica dwon Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 43 1/4 . JP Morgan was down Dollars
1 3/8 at Dollars 57 5/8 .
ITT, the conglomerate, which earlier this week agreed to sell its 30 per
cent stake in telecommunications group Alcatel, dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to
Dollars 63 7/8 following a meeting with Wall Street analysts on Thursday
afternoon. Yesterday PaineWebber cut its forecast for ITT's estimated
earnings.
In the pharmaceuticals sector, American Home Products initially rose,
following a favourable press article and news that a broker had improved its
rating, yet ended the day down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 75 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO STOCKS finished lower, but regained some losses in late trading.
Based on preliminary data, the composite index lost 14.71 points, or 0.41
per cent, to 3,530.84, but climbed in late trading from a low of about
3,524. The index was down about 51 points, or 1.4 per cent, on the week.
Declining issues led advances 334 to 248. Volume was 27.168m shares and
trading value was CDollars 242.5m.
The pipeline sub-group led the fall with a 1.62 per cent drop on index.
Management lost 1.16 per cent, golds 1.01 per cent, and mining, financial
services, industrial products, energy and consumer products were moderately
lower.

FT  07 MAR 92 / International Company News: Perrier battle swings Nestle's
way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE labyrinthine struggle between Nestle and Italy's Agnelli family for
control of Source Perrier, the French mineral water company, yesterday swung
in favour of the Swiss food multinational.
A commercial court in Nimes, near Perrier's spring in southern France, ruled
that voting rights on a third of the 35.5 per cent Perrier stake owned by
Exor, an Agnelli-controlled holding company, must be frozen for two years.
The move automatically cuts the Agnelli camp's total votes in Perrier from
49.3 per cent to to 37.5 per cent and is a partial victory for Nestle in one
of two crucial court actions it is undertaking to reduce the Italian stake.
Perrier's share price rose by FFr28 in response, to close at FFr1,568.
Previously, the Agnellis controlled 35.5 per cent of Perrier through Exor -
now reduced to 23.7 per cent  - and still hold another 13.8 per cent in
Perrier treasury shares bought in January by Saint Louis, the paper and
sugar group which they control with Worms et Cie, a family holding group.
'For the first time since the beginning of the conflict, Nestle is in a good
position to get control of Perrier,' said Mr Sylvain Massot, European food
and beverages analyst at Morgan Stanley International.
Exactly how much of Perrier is owned by the Swiss group will not be known
until the FFr13.4bn (Dollars 2.3bn) hostile offer it is making for the water
group, with Banque Indosuez, closes on March 24.
The three-month battle has deeply split the French business establishment.
On the Nestle side stand Banque Indosuez and Lazard, the bank which has
traditionally dominated the takeover market. Lazard is loyal to BSN, the
leading French foods group which is deeply anxious over the Agnellis'
ambitions and is trying to force the Italians to negotiate.
The Agnellis, once close to Lazard, are backed by Exor, the commercial bank
Societe Generale, and the Worms family, a historic commercial dynasty.
Nestle did not get all that it wanted from the Nimes court yesterday, in
that it had asked the judge to freeze all Exor's voting rights for five
years, on the grounds that Exor and its allies had secretly built up control
of Perrier against French takeover rules.
The Swiss group is trying to annul the sale of the 13.8 per cent Perrier
stake to Saint Louis in another legal action, on the grounds that the
transaction took place illicitly, in the knowledge that Nestle was about to
make an offer at a higher price.
That transaction is due for a ruling by the Paris commercial court on March
16, just under a week before Nestle's offer closes. If the Swiss group wins,
the Agnelli camp could end up with as little as 32 per cent of Perrier,
estimated Mr Massot.
Exor said yesterday's ruling was 'regrettable but not a catastrophe'.

FT  07 MAR 92 / International Company News: Murdoch holding in News Corp
diluted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rupert Murdoch's family shareholding in News Corporation has been diluted
to 41 per cent from 44.8 per cent as a result of moves to strengthen the
group's balance sheet following its financial crisis last year.
The dilution, which was expected, was divulged by News Corp in a filing to
the Australian Stock Exchange. News Corp is incorporated in Adelaide,
although it is run from the US.
News Corp said the number of voting shares held by Mr Murdoch and his family
companies Cruden Investments and Kayarem had risen to 150m from 120m in
September.
However, the family's holding was diluted by the issue of 96m new shares as
part of News Corp's refinancing since the completion last year of a
USDollars 7.6bn debt rescheduling agreement with more than 100 banks.
The group issued 42m shares in December, and just under 2m in September and
October as part of its dividend re-investment plan for shareholders. The
remaining 52m shares were issued on conversion of the company's convertible
notes.
News Corp announced the latest step in its refinancing on Thursday in New
York, where News America Holdings, the group's principal US subsidiary, said
it planned to raise about USDollars 300m in zero coupon exchangeable
subordinated notes.
News Corp has raised about USDollars 1.5bn recently through the issue of
notes and shares, asset sales, and the part-flotation of Pacific Magazines
and Printing, an Australian subsidiary.
The refinancing programme has been generally well received. Standard and
Poor's, the US credit rating agency, raised News Corp's long-term debt
rating from BB minus to B in December.

FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Kunick raises Pounds 5.6m from Dungeons
sale

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUNICK, the amusement machine and nursing home group, yesterday released its
second profits warning in less than six months and said that it was selling
the London and York Dungeons for Pounds 5.6m.
The company blamed the recessions in the UK and France, which had been
longer than expected.
It said first half profits to end-March would be 'substantially below' the
Pounds 7.3m last time. The shares, which traded at 36p before the first
profits warning in October, fell a further 2p to 9p.
UK amusement machine business continued to be hit by the economic downturn
and uncertainty following the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on
beer supply, the company said.
Kunick has previously estimated that between 10,000 to 15,000 pubs have
ceased trading during the recession.
Mr Russell Smith, chairman, said care services were performing
satisfactorily, except for sale and rental of close care and sheltered
housing units which continued to be affected by the state of the housing
market.
He added that it was impossible to predict group trading levels in the
second half of this year.
Kunick plans a further review of operations and will reduce borrowings
through the sale of The London Dungeon and The York Dungeon tourist sites
for Pounds 5.6m to Winchmore.
Winchmore is itself being restructured following the resignation of the
existing management and the appointment of Mr David Hudd, a non-executive
director of Kunick, as chairman.
Winchmore will pay for the acquisition through a placing of 17.9m new shares
at 40p to raise Pounds 6.8m. The company also plans to change its name to
Vardon.
The London Dungeon attracted 434,000 visitors in the year to end-September,
down from about 500,000 the previous year, with 123,000 visitors at York.
The two sites made trading profits of Pounds 1.26m from turnover of Pounds
2.22m during the period.

<TEXT>
Cray Electronics, the software systems, telecommunications and
instrumentation group, is paying Pounds 16.8m for Autofile, a software
specialist best known for its ATOP holiday reservation system, writes Angus
Foster.
Cray also expects to pay its first dividend since 1989 when it announces
results for the year to end-April. The dividend was suspended after new
management under Sir Peter Michael took over the company, which had been
rocked by overspending and overstated profits.
Autofile made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.3m from sales of Pounds 16.1m last
year. More than 80 per cent of sales were due to ATOP, which is used by tour
operators like Owners Abroad and Virgin Holidays.
Cray will pay for the purchase through the issue of 27.8m new shares.
A total of 4.2m shares will remain with Autofile's existing shareholders,
mainly senior management. A further 23.6m shares are being placed by SG
Warburg and offered to Cray shareholders on the basis of one new share for
every 4.5184 existing shares at 61p.

FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: TV-am chief warns about the future of
Sunrise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRUCE Gyngell, chairman of TV-am, the commercial television breakfast
station, warned yesterday that its successor, Sunrise, could be out of
business within 18 months.
Mr Gyngell was speaking after announcing that his company had made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 12.5m for the 11 months to December 31, against Pounds 26m
for the previous full year.
The taxable figure was struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 4.2m (nil)
related to redundancy and other contractual payments incurred by the
termination of TV-am's news operation.
The TV-am chairman said he accepted that Sunrise, which won the breakfast
franchise with a bid of Pounds 34.6m, would probably have lower costs than
TV-am's. But he warned that Sunrise - its main shareholders include London
Weekend Television, Scottish Television, Disney, The Guardian and Carlton
Communications - would run into trouble on the revenue side.
Mr Gyngell said that Sunrise was expecting revenues of Pounds 117m in 1995
compared with TV-am's forecasts of Pounds 82m and had to pay 15 per cent of
advertising revenue on top of the bid. 'I feel it is important to stress
that the Pounds 14m that the company (TV-am) bid for the franchise was the
maximum that the board considered we could responsibly make and continue to
have a profitable company,' he said. He believes that satellite television
will make increasing inroads into both the breakfast television audience and
advertising revenues.
Mr Gyngell predicted that Sunrise would have to hand back its licence and
that the Independent Television Commission would get no other takers at the
current bid level.
TV-am's turnover for the 11 months was Pounds 79.4m (Pounds 89.4m for the 12
months) and an unchanged final dividend of 10p maintains the total at 14p.
TV-am has cash reserves of Pounds 48m and is likely to take the figure to
about Pounds 70m when its franchise runs out at the end of this year.

<TEXT>
Property Trust, the property investment and development company, is
proposing a financial reconstruction and property sale to put the
loss-making group on a sound footing. It also announced an interim loss of
Pounds 6.32m following provisions on its investments.
The company plans to consolidate 200 of its 1p shares into one Pounds 2
share to be reclassified as one 25p share and one deferred share of Pounds
1.75. This will be followed by a reduction in share capital and share
premium account enabling dividends to be paid in future.
It also plans to move up from the USM to a full listing.
The Pounds 8m proceeds from the property sale will be used to repay two
loans resulting in an interest saving of about Pounds 1m a year. Following
the sale the company said the interest charge would be covered 1.8 times by
rental income.
In the six months to September 30 there was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.32m
(Pounds 703,000) on turnover of Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 734,000).
The operating loss was Pounds 189,000 plus the carrying values of
development properties were written down by Pounds 1.59m and there was loss
of Pounds 3.56m arising from the property sale.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LATIN AMERICAN Invest-ment Trust (LAIT), the top-performing investment trust
in 1991, reported net assets per share more than doubled to Dollars 1.77
last year, from 79.5 cents in 1990, writes Sara Webb.
Net assets rose from Dollars 59.7m in 1990 to Dollars 133.1m (Pounds 75.6m)
last year, helped by gains in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Chile. Argentina
was the emerging market that performed best in 1991 - it almost quintupled
in US dollar terms.
The dividend of 50 cents per share, is small but reflects the lack of
'dividend culture' among Latin American companies, according to the
managers.
Mr Eduardo Faria, who manages the fund for Latin American Securities, said
that LAIT's net assets had risen to Dollars 158.8m, or Dollars 2.12 per
share, so far this year, helped by rallies in Brazil, Chile and Mexico.

FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lincoln House cuts losses to Pounds 286,000

<TEXT>
LINCOLN HOUSE, the home furnishing group, yesterday reported that pre-tax
losses fell from Pounds 2.35m to Pounds 286,000 in the year to December 31.
The company, which in 1990 was hit by the fall into receivership of Lowndes
Queensway, the home furnishing retailer, said turnover had dropped from
Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 10.3m.
Despite the deepening recession, rationalisation had produced a small
operating profit of Pounds 46,000, compared with an loss of Pounds 1.24m.
Interest payable had fallen from Pounds 479,000 to to Pounds 332,000.
The company said this improvement reflected its shift away from unprofitable
national account business, such as Lowndes Queensway, and the continuation
of tight managerial controls. However, the significant repositioning of the
business which had taken place continued to be hindered the the recession.
There was a loss per share of 1.77p, compared with a loss of 14.59p, and the
company again passed its dividend.
Mr David Harland, chairman, said prospects were much improved from the
traumatic period of 1990 and he believed a reasonable level of profitability
would be achieved when UK and European trading regained momentum.
Lincoln House (Furnishings), the company's largest subsidiary, which
manufactures upholstered furniture, made an operating loss of Pounds 40,000
on sales of Pounds 7.68m. This compared with losses of Pounds 1.32m on sales
of Pounds 12.54m.
Mayers &amp; Shaw, the occasional table subsidiary, made an operating profit of
Pounds 117,000 (Pounds 159,000) on sales of Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 1.79m).
The company said Impala Displays, its display equipment subsidiary, had a
poor year, producing an operating loss of Pounds 31,000 on sales of Pounds
1.19m. In order to save management time and resources for the group's
furniture subsidiaries, Impala was last month sold to its management team.

FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Concern grows over lack of MGN sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS OF Mirror Group Newspapers are increasingly concerned about the
lack of progress in finding a new owner for the popular newspaper group.
Disquiet has been expressed to Mr John Talbot, the administrator responsible
for the late Mr Robert Maxwell's controlling 51 per cent stake in MGN. The
stake is effectively held by major banks because it was pledged as
collateral to cover Maxwell debt.
In January Mr Talbot ruled out an early disposal saying that consideration
would be given to the timing of any sale 'when comprehensive information is
available from the board'.
Sir Peter Parker, chairman of a management buy-out team believes that delay
could cause instability and damage the group. It is a view shared by at
least some of the senior directors of MGN.
There is also concern about the large financing charges and fees going out
of the newspaper company while it essentially exists on a drip-feed.
It is believed that MGN had to pay about Pounds 11m in charges to roll over
debt. Fees from National Westminster Bank alone are believed to be running
at the rate of Pounds 150,000 a month.
There were unconfirmed rumours last night that Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish
publisher and businessman and a potential purchaser of MGN planned to meet
union representatives prior to the England-Wales rugby match at Twickenham
today. Mr O'Reilly is a former Irish rugby international.

FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Redland raises stakes in Steetley bid -
Full cash alternative more important than increased share offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDLAND yesterday delivered what it hopes will be a knock-out blow by
increasing its share offer and providing a full cash alternative for
Steetley, its rival building materials group.
Redland is offering 87 of its shares for every 100 Steetley shares, valuing
its target at Pounds 624.7m or 388.9p a share. The cash alternative is worth
365p a share.
Previously Redland's offer was on a 85-for-100 basis and had provided only a
partial cash alternative.
Steetley has advised its shareholders to take no action until the group had
convened a board meeting to consider the increased offer.
Following yesterday's moves, Redland's share price fell 7p to 447p. Steetley
shares rose from 377p to 380p. Redland is also offering 100p for every
Steetley 3.15 per cent cumulative preference share.
The decision to provide a full cash alternative was regarded as more
important than the slight increase in the ordinary share offer which was
offset by the subsequent fall in Redland's share price.
Redland said that a full cash offer would allow it to buy up to 29.9 per
cent of Steetley's shares in the market. Under the previous terms, it could
only have bought up to 9.9 per cent.
Some of Steetley's institutional shareholders have indicated that they would
prefer a full cash offer although it is questionable whether they would have
declined Redland's original terms given the weak defence put up by Steetley.
Steetley's revelation in its defence document on Thursday, that it had been
forced to cut Pounds 40m from the book value of its French business was
regarded by independent brokers as a body blow at that stage of a bid.
Redland's new offer compares with an asset value estimated by Steetley in
its defence document of 375p - or 394p if the value to Redland of its
surplus advance corporation tax capacity were to be included.
Mr Robert Napier, Redland managing director, said last night: 'We have now
seen Steetley's defence and it is weak. Its profits have collapsed; it is
financially stretched; plans to merge its UK brick and clay tile operations
with Tarmac have collapsed and it has written off nearly half the cost of
Gobitta, its largest ever acquisition.
'Our offer provides Steetley shareholders with a 55 per cent capital
increase on the price of Steetley shares at the beginning of December when
our bid was announced.
'It will also provide a 55 per cent increase in income and participation in
a well financed international group which is strong in focused products and
will benefit from Pounds 30m of cost savings from a takeover of Steetley by
Redland,' said Mr Napier.
The offer is due to close at 1pm on Thursday, March 26.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Clouds on the retirement horizon: A classic case of fund
stripping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Victor Edwards, a 57-year-old foreman at Greenfield Mill on the Lancashire
side of the Pennines, has spent most of his working life with the same
company, paper maker Robert Fletcher. For most of that time Fletcher was a
subsidiary of Imperial Group, a paternalistic employer celebrated for the
generosity of its pension benefits. But the company, whose paper is used in
cigarette making, has now changed hands; and with eight years to go to
retirement, Mr Edwards is worried, both for himself and his fellow workers.
The problems started at the time Imperial was under threat from a hostile
takeover by Hanson, the acquisitive conglomerate. Imperial was keen to
dispose of the mills; and when they were parcelled up individually for sale
in early 1986, the workers were asked to consent to their pension rights
being transferred to two new funds. This they did, despite misgivings, on
the basis of assurances by the Imperial management that safeguards would be
maintained and that benefits would be at least as good as those in the old
schemes.
The buyer of both mills turned out to be Melton Medes, an unquoted
Nottingham-based conglomerate run by Mr Nathu Ram Puri. Through Melton Medes
and another company, Melham Holdings, this Indian-born entrepreneur has
acquired large stakes in quoted concerns such as British Syphon Industries,
Delaney Group and Marling Industries. Mr Puri has also attracted attention
with unsuccessful bids for state-owned enterprises, including Rover Group
and North East Shipbuilders. His approach to pension fund management is
unorthodox.
Soon after the two Robert Fletcher mills changed hands, Mr Puri embarked on
a classic exercise in what is known as pension fund stripping. First, the
existence of a surplus was used to justify an immediate pension fund
holiday, whereby company contributions into the funds were suspended. They
remain suspended today. Then Melton Medes Pension Trustees, a company
registered as an investment manager with the self-regulatory fund management
watchdog Imro, took charge of the Fletcher pension funds. It was effectively
controlled by Mr Puri.
The annual accounts of Melton Medes, audited by Kidsons Impey, declare each
year that 'the scheme funds are administered by trustees and are independent
of the company's finances'. Yet despite this assurance, and the earlier
assurances from the Imperial management, the two Fletcher pension funds
suddenly found themselves advancing a Pounds 5m loan to Melton Medes at an
interest rate of just 2 per cent. The only security was a second charge on
the freehold properties of the Fletcher companies.
Those terms appear wholly uncommercial; and for Fletcher's Greenfield
workers, the loan constituted more than 30 per cent of the total value of
the pension fund in 1987, implying a dangerously unbalanced portfolio.
Members of the pension fund were unaware of this conflict of interest when
the transaction was undertaken. Nor could they extract much information from
the management and the trustees - effectively one and the same - about the
safeguards that were supposed to be built into the new funds. They were
constantly denied access to information. But when the Occupational Pension
Schemes (Disclosure of Information) Regulations 1986 came into force, they
provided a lever for the Greenfield foreman, Mr Edwards, to prise a set of
fund accounts from Mr Puri.
'When I did see the accounts my worst fears were realised,' he says. 'I was
shocked at what had happened. How could the loan and some of the investments
be regarded in any way in the interest of the trust's beneficiaries?
'Any impression that my pension fund was protected with lots of safeguards
for its future members had disappeared.'
In 1987 Mr Puri and his two fellow trustees appear to have had second
thoughts about the loan. The interest rate was raised from 2 per cent to the
prevailing National Westminster Bank base rate. Yet that still appears to
fall short of a commercial rate for a loan to an unquoted company secured by
a second charge on less than prime property.
Today the loan has been repaid. But the pension funds have not been
compensated by the company for the uncommercial terms on which their
trustees advanced the money, thereby raising questions about a possible
breach of trust. How were the trustees fulfilling their obligation to the
beneficiaries, if the fund's biggest investment was yielding an uncommercial
return in circumstances where the trustees were involved in a potential
conflict of interest?
Mr Edwards and the workforce at Greenfield continue, meantime, to worry
about the potential conflict of interest between Melton Medes' own
investment activities and those of the pension funds.
Through Melton Medes Mr Puri has acquired substantial stakes in quoted
companies whose shares have suffered mixed fortunes. One such is the
diversified group Marling Industries. Melton Medes acquired its holding in
Marling in 1988. Subsequently the two Fletcher pension funds and Melton
Medes' own group pension fund have invested heavily in the shares. And in
the year to end-June 1990 Marling emerged as the largest equity holding in
all three funds. In the Fletcher Greenfield fund the holding accounted for
no less than 9 per cent of the pension scheme's total assets. The risk in
this overweight position in a company capitalised at a little more than
Pounds 30m has since been underlined by Marling's results. In its latest
half-year the dividend was cut, following a sharp fall in profits.
At the loss-making Delaney Group, in which Melton Medes and Mr Puri have a
controlling stake, the Fletcher Greenfield fund acquired 75,000 shares when
Mr Puri bought into the company in the late 1980s. It has been a disastrous
investment, with the share price plunging from more than Pounds 1 down to
6p.
All this suggests that the pension fund members have good reason to be
nervous about Mr Puri's investment judgment. According to the last published
accounts of Melton Medes, the market value of its quoted investments, had
fallen Pounds 8.7m below the book cost of Pounds 20.4m. The fund members
might reasonably question, too, the use of their pension money in tandem
with Mr Puri's wider corporate investments. How does this square with a
trustee's overriding obli Finally, the Greenfield pensioners might question
whether the investment performance justifies a more than trebling of
administrative costs, including management fees, to Pounds 174,000 between
1988 and 1989 for a Pounds 13m fund, the greater part of which was handled
by an outside fund manager, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
The Financial Times was unable to raise these issues directly with Mr Puri,
because he was ill. But Mr James Philpotts, the chief executive of Melton
Medes and a trustee with Mr Puri of the pension funds, said that the loan
from the Fletcher funds to Melton Medes had been used to finance the
Fletcher businesses, to which the parent company passed on the full benefit
of the low loan rate. This, he said, had helped provide security of
employment to the workforce.
But that fails to address the issue of the conflict of interest vis a vis
existing pensioners. As for the pension funds' investments in companies in
which Melton Medes itself holds substantial stakes, Mr Philpotts said 'you
do have your good ones and you do have your bad ones'. On the overweight
pension fund position in Marling Industries he saw 'a commonality of
interest' with Melton Medes. He added that he thought part of the holding
had been bought direct from Melton Medes at market value, part in the stock
market - though what the market value of large parcels of shares in such a
small company might be is a moot point. Mr Philpotts did not believe that
the management fees were unduly high.
These arguments do not impress Mr Edwards. His worries about the conflict of
interest in Mr Puri's position are magnified by the present financial
difficulties of the two main companies in his loosely-knit empire. Melton
Medes' net debt of Pounds 48.7m, most of it short term, towered above
shareholders' funds of Pounds 33.6m at end-1990. Melham Holdings, though
profitable in the year to December 31 1990, had a deficiency of assets
against liabilities of Pounds 2.1m after excluding goodwill.
The chances of the pension funds receiving compensation in relation to the
uncommercial loan terms are also mixed. After an approach from Mr Edwards,
the Graphical Paper and Media Union has decided this week to take legal
action on the pension fund members' behalf. But the potential cost of Pounds
250,000 is daunting.
Union official Mr John Brough says: 'Where problems are discovered in
pension funds and where there appears to be a good case in law, we have to
risk hundreds of thousands of pounds to fight the point in the law. The
companies involved risk nothing, since their managers are invariably
trustees and can defend any action from the fund itself.'
Whatever the outcome, Mr Puri's pensioners will be worrying about their
retirement prospects for some time yet.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Questionable guarantee of the pensions pot: The legal
loophole which allows trustees to close funds or change the rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the 13m members of Britain's occupational pension schemes, the looting
of the Maxwell pension funds has raised awkward questions about the nature
and safety of pension rights. There may not be further frauds on the scale
perpetrated by the late Mr Maxwell. But many pension fund members have been
uncomfortably reminded that they have little or no say over their
second-largest investment after home ownership; and that the employer can
have a worrying degree of discretion and control.
The plight of the workforce and pensioners within the Melton Medes group
(see below) clearly demonstrates the inherent risks in the present system.
The prime duty of pension trustees is to exercise their powers in the best
interests of present and future pensioners. Yet in practice, the directors
of the company usually constitute a majority or all of the trustees. And
while pension fund assets are nominally separate from the finances of the
employer, they are increasingly becoming intertwined as companies tap
pension fund surpluses by ceasing to make contributions or by extracting
money directly.
Trust law, under which most pension funds are governed, was not designed to
cope with this potential conflict of interest in which the employer - the
original 'settlor' of the trust  - retains an ongoing financial interest in
the fund. And despite warnings from such authorities as the Wilson Committee
on the financial system and Professor L C B Gower, author of the
government's review of investor protection in the early 1980s, regulation
remains patchy.
The difficulty experienced by the workers at Melton Medes in extracting
information from the trustees is not unusual. Nor is there anything in the
government's existing regulations that specifically prevents the investment
practices undertaken by the Melton Medes trustees which involved potential
conflicts of interest. The whole system is dangerously dependent on the
goodwill of trustees. And that goodwill is being sorely tested in the
present recession.
The prohibitive cost and legal obstacles involved in seeking remedies have
long been recognised. Sean Hand, of City solicitors Cameron Markby Hewitt,
quotes the 1982 report of the Occupational Pensions Board which said: 'The
ability of beneficiaries to obtain redress of grievances against trustees is
one of the most unsatisfactory areas of present trust law.'
The report of the Commons Select Committee on Social Security on the Maxwell
affair, due on Monday, will call for legislation and will no doubt get it in
due course. But tighter regulation should not be the end of the story,
because the real issue is control. The moral justification for the
employers' continuing control of this Pounds 300bn pot of money is that they
guarantee the solvency of the funds. Yet the guarantee is meaningless, since
most trust deeds permit the trustees to close the fund or change the rules.
Nor is it clear what such a guarantee might mean for pensioners in a
situation similar to the one described below at Melton Medes.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Shadow boxing: Negative campaigning is the latest fashion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We have at last reached the final act. Soon the electorate will have its
chance to write the denouement. On Tuesday, Mr Norman Lamont will launch the
Conservative election campaign with a tax-cutting Budget. In 48 hours - and
quite probably sooner  - Mr John Major, the prime minister, will ask the
Queen to dissolve parliament to pave the way for an April 9 election. It
will be the first election since the 1970s in which the occupant of Number
10 Downing Street cannot be sure of the outcome.
At Westminster this week, fever mingled with farce as the opinion polls
fuelled the dangerous uncertainty. The Conservatives and Labour are still
neck-and-neck with a fraction less than 40 per cent of the vote. Mr Paddy
Ashdown's Liberal Democrats, a couple of points adrift of 20 per cent, at
present hold the balance.
So Mr Major swapped increasingly angry insults with Mr Neil Kinnock across
the Commons despatch box. The government showered marginal constituencies
with taxpayers' money and Mr Kenneth Baker bid for the gamblers' vote with
plans for a national lottery. Labour paraded disenchanted hospital
consultants to support its charge that the health service reforms put cash
before care. The Liberal Democrats stole a dubious headline with a public
claim to be the party of the pet-owner.
On Thursday night in Downing Street, Mr Major was joined by his ministerial
'A' team to put the final touches to a manifesto which insiders say will
'catch the mood of the country'. Thatcherism will survive in plans for tax
cuts, in an emphasis on personal choice and incentives to ownership;
Majorism will manifest itself in an accent on 'quality of life' issues with
a commitment to responsive public services.
The 'A' Team stars chosen to sell the package to the voters are Mr Chris
Patten, Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr Douglas Hurd and Mr Kenneth Clarke. One of
them calls it 'Thatcherism with a human face'. For another insider: 'It has
some good new things but it cannot be sold as a 'change the world'
manifesto.'
Labour too has settled on its message, even if the intricacies of the
party's constitution mean that the manifesto cannot formally be written
until the election date is announced.
Its traditional status as guardian of the welfare state is to be underpinned
by the grey-suited sobriety of Mr John Smith's approach to the economy.
Investment, skills training and technological advance will pay for better
health and education and for a more compassionate approach to the
underprivileged.
The prospectus will emphasise a consensual, rather than confrontational,
approach to economic revival; an overhaul of the nation's crumbling
constitutional architecture; an emphasis on the role of society as well as
that of the individual. The leading salesmen for this moderate modernism
will be Mr Smith, Mr Gordon Brown, Mr Tony Blair and Mr Robin Cook. What
they will be selling, one of them says, is 'European social democracy'.
The contrasting themes will provide the backdrop for the campaign war but
they are unlikely to dominate the headlines. As a Conservative insider puts
it, an election more closely fought than any since the 1970s will also be
more unpleasantly fought.
For all the talk about competing visions of the future, both sides
acknowledge that in a phoney war lasting almost a year neither has succeeded
in catching the popular imagination. The vogue is negative campaigning.
Chatting in the lobby of the House of Commons this week, a senior member of
Labour's team explained why he was confident that in a matter of weeks he
would be sitting at the cabinet table. There was no mention of the avalanche
of policy documents in which his party has set out a more detailed programme
than any opposition in living memory.
The outcome, he confided, would depend on 'whether the voters' determination
to get them out exceeds their desire to keep us out'. After weeks touring
marginal constituencies, he was sure that resentment at what he called the
Conservatives' mismanagement of the economy outweighed the fear of a Labour
government.
At the heart of Mr Major's campaign will be an effort to maximise that fear.
It will start with the Budget.
Framing an electorally attractive package which will leave the government
with a still credible claim to be the party of prudence has not been an
entirely smooth process. Mr Lamont and Mr Major are said to have exchanged
harsh words on how to strike that balance at a Downing Street summit 10 days
ago.
But they have now agreed on a package combining an immediate cut in income
tax - a downpayment for the voters  - with a series of measures signposting
more radical reductions across the tax system after the election.
So the campaign will start on Conservative ground. Mr Kinnock, who has
promised consistently that only the affluent will pay more tax under a
Labour government, may be forced to repudiate any Budget tax cuts for those
much lower down the income scale. As a senior minister puts it: 'It will
define the campaign. If you want more money in your pocket, vote
Conservative.'
The message will be rammed home with an escalation of the offensive that Mr
Patten launched in January against the tax 'bombshell' implied by Labour's
commitments to higher public spending. In the marginal constituencies of
southern England, voters will be reminded again and again of the
opposition's plans to abolish the Pounds 20,000-a-year income ceiling on
national insurance contributions. Then there is its proposal to limit other
tax allowances and to extend NICs to income from savings.
Mr Patten's timetable has this phase of the campaign lasting for a week to
10 days. The aim is to steal an initial march in the opinion polls and to
destabilise the opposition before moving on to other Conservative issues
such as the trades unions, defence and law and order. Tax and spending are
pencilled in again for the last week of the campaign.
The plan envisages that for most of the time Mr Major will stand above the
fray. His strength lies in his experience in Downing Street and his
popularity in the high street. He will be sold as the prime minister who is
just as much at home on the doorstep in Bolton as he is striding the
international stage with George Bush in Washington or Boris Yeltsin in
Moscow. He has proved his worth and now deserves his own mandate.
This though will not be the sort of election campaign susceptible to advance
scripts. It is too close to be predictable. Labour and the Liberal Democrats
have their own competing blueprints. This is the first election since 1974
that Labour is convinced it can win; and the first since the same year in
which the third party has a chance of emerging with the balance of power.
Mr Kinnock is ready to fight the first week of the campaign on the Budget
package: but he will focus on the economy. As the Conservatives seek to
scare the voters over tax, Labour intends to fan resentment over the
recession. Time for a change is an old slogan but still perhaps Labour's
most powerful.
The view in the shadow cabinet is that tax cuts have been largely discounted
by the electorate. Mr Kinnock is convinced that the elision he has made
between lower taxes and higher borrowing has discredited in advance the case
for a pre-election give-away. If the voters have learned anything from
personal experience during the boom-to-bust of the past five years, it is
that after the party comes the hangover.
So Labour's pitch will be that anything promised before the election will be
taken back afterwards. That its promise to 'build' rather than to 'bribe'
offers the only real prospect of sustained economic recovery.
So whatever Mr Lamont offers in tax cuts, Mr Smith will pledge to spend on
investment and training, the health service and education. Beyond that, the
shadow chancellor remains committed to the core of his tax package -
abolishing the NICs ceiling and raising the top rate of income tax to 50 per
cent - he might yet decide there was scope to phase the increases.
Labour will then seek to shift the campaign to its agenda - the health
service, education, poverty. For every Conservative horror story about tax,
there will be a Labour one about a child denied a hospital bed. As one of Mr
Major's strategists put it: 'In the end there will only be two issues: tax
and the NHS.'
After a year of near-permanent electioneering it is a less than edifying
prospect. The Budget looks likely to hand back the initiative to the
Conservatives, but the denouement is as easily predicted as the first
national lottery winner.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Vauxhall car workers offered 5.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUAL WORKERS at Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors, have been
offered inflation-plus pay rises averaging 5.5 per cent after industrial
action including an overtime ban.
The offer, which is being recommended by union negotiators, provides for
rises of nearly 2 percentage points above the 3.7 per cent inflation rate
for the year to last October, the settlement month. It would also guarantee
the more than 8,000 workers inflation plus 0.5 per cent in the second year
of the two-year deal.
The proposed settlement is higher than that recently won by 30,000 manual
workers at Ford. They settled for 5 per cent in the first year and inflation
plus 0.5 per cent in the second.
Like Ford, Vauxhall has resisted pressure for a cut in the working week.
Rover and Jaguar last year agreed deals for 37-hour weeks, compared with the
39-hour industry norm.
Managers would also secure union approval through the offer for a slower
growth in productivity payments.
Nonetheless the proposed settlement is considerably above the average in
manufacturing industry, put by most pay research organisations at between 4
per cent and 5 per cent.
The offer was reached after more than nine months of negotiations, a long
period even by the standards of the motor industry, which is renowned for
protracted talks. It was delayed in part because of the wrangle over the
size of the offer and because workers at Luton, where the company has one of
its two car plants and a parts centre, were concerned at proposed changes.
These are similar to those agreed two years ago at Ellesmere Port, the
company's Cheshire plant. They included single-table bargaining, team
working and cashless pay. The changes would trigger pay increases of about 5
per cent on top of the national deal.
The average 5.5 per cent rise under the national offer comprises 5 per cent
for all manual workers plus Pounds 1.13 a week. Skilled day workers at
present earn about Pounds 242 a week including bonuses.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Budget 92: Borrowing prospects set City nerves jangling -
How economists view the chancellor's options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS Budget day ap-proaches, the City is getting twitchy. A week ago the
consensus was that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, could risk a
'give-away' Budget next Tuesday in the cause of strengthening the
Conservatives' re-election chances. Now many private-sector economists are
not so sure.
Reflecting this sentiment, financial markets in the past few days have
looked jittery. Sterling has slipped, while and gilts have lost about 2
points over the week.
One worry is that Britain's public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) looks
certain to rise sharply during the next two years, partly because of tax
cuts likely to be announced on Tuesday.
Another concern for the markets is that opinion polls have shown strong
support for the Labour party. Many economists think a Labour government
would push up borrowing still more, jeopardising sterling's position in the
European exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
Mr Peter Spencer, UK economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers, the US
investment bank, says: 'From a City perspective, a high PSBR is all very
well if a Tory government is re-elected. But if it simply opens the door to
new borrowing under Labour, then it's a different kettle of fish.'
The view among many economists remains that Mr Lamont will inject up to
Pounds 4bn into the economy, with Pounds 2bn of this coming from a 1p cut in
the 25p standard rate of income tax. Other sweeteners could include a rise
in child allowances, aid to industry through increased tax relief on
investment spending and a cut in the 10 per cent special car tax to help
hard-hit carmakers.
With Britain suffering the longest recession for 50 years, and the
possibility of a general election in the next month, generosity of this sort
is not hard to justify. But while Mr Lamont could argue that such a stimulus
is needed to revive the economy, the effect on the long-term PSBR trend has
started to worry some financial analysts.
Britain's need to borrow on financial markets by issuing gilts is rising
anyway, partly because of the Pounds 11bn extra public spending for 1992-93
which Mr Lamont unveiled in his Autumn Statement last November.
The recession has reduced tax income and pushed up spending in areas such as
unemployment benefit. Any additional government spending will increase its
need to borrow.
Consequently, the PSBR is thought likely to rise from about Pounds 12bn in
the fiscal year ending on March 31 to about Pounds 25bn in 1992-93. In
1993-94 it could reach about Pounds 35bn.
Many economists are not too uncomfortable about such figures, arguing that
they represent only 4 per cent to 5 per cent of gross domestic product,
which is not high historically. Also Britain's ratio of debt to GDP is less
than in many other comparable economies, giving it more leeway to relax
controls on spending when the economy is under strain.
Others say Mr Lamont is virtually forced to follow an active fiscal stance
if he wants to boost the economy, as large cuts in interest rates, now at
10.5 per cent, are ruled out by ERM membership.
Sir Fred Atkinson, a former chief economic adviser at the Treasury, says:
'Britain still has fiscal freedom. Mr Lamont might as well use it.'
Added to this is the likely political effect of a generous Budget. Mr
Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, the US investment house,
says: 'A give-away Budget runs less of a risk of unsettling markets than one
that is lacklustre or modest.'
Looking further into the 1990s, however, some economists see little likely
improvement in the PSBR figures.
Mr Malcolm Roberts, a bond specialist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the
Swiss-owned bank, thinks the PSBR could shoot up to Pounds 40bn in 1993-94
and Pounds 50bn in 1994-95.
If this happened Britain might have trouble finding buyers for the gilts it
would need to issue to fund the borrowing. Interest rates might have to rise
to make the gilts more attractive.
Some argue that if the PSBR rose to unacceptable levels, sweeping tax cuts -
the goal of many Tory supporters  - could become still more difficult to
push through.
Professor Patrick Minford, a monetarist economist at Liverpool University,
says: 'The government has given up trying to control public spending;
they've let the horse rip.'
The debate remains, too, about to what degree next week's likely cuts in
income tax are appropriate from an economic point of view, rather than as a
vote-winning gambit.
Ms Ruth Lea, UK economist at the London office of Mitsubishi Bank, the
Japanese investment house, says: 'If you want a quick economic kick, a tax
cut is probably appropriate. But for the longer term, extra money on
public-sector investment (in areas like roads and railways) might be a more
sensible way of putting money into the economy.'
For all the talk about figures, many in the City will be looking next
Tuesday not so much for the statistical detail in Mr Lamont's Budget
statement but for the way he presents it with a view to influencing voters.
Mr Kevin Gardiner, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, the UK investment
group, says: 'Make no mistake, this will be straightforward electioneering
Budget.'

FT  07 MAR 92 / MPs urge fresh review of Army cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARMY CHIEFS are hopeful that the next government will reconsider the scale
of planned troop cuts after a critical report by MPs yesterday called for 'a
fresh assessment' of manpower requirements.
Ministers have repeatedly warned that only a significant worsening of the
international situation would justify a change in plans announced last year.
The Commons defence committee said it feared the Army reductions - from
156,000 to 116,000 - had been 'taken too far' and might leave insufficient
leeway for the Army to deal with an unexpected crisis. Even peacetime tasks
might cause 'unacceptable strain'.
A particular source of concern was how units assigned to Nato's new Rapid
Reaction Corps would cope while being liable for six-month emergency tours
in Northern Ireland.
The committee, chaired by the Conservative MP Mr Michael Mates, said it did
not propose 'another major upheaval' on the lines of the Options for Change
review. The report called into question the way regiments had been selected
for merger or disbandment, and upbraided ministers for refusing to account
in detail for the rationale behind the decisions.
Senior Army officers believe it may be possible after the general election
to revise the target figure of 116,000 by several thousand.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Plan to retire judges at 70
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is proposing to reduce the compulsory retirement age for
judges from 75 to 70, Robert Rice writes.
In a letter sent to judges in England, Wales and Northern Ireland yesterday
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, said: 'I believe that the time has come to
reduce the retirement age for the judiciary, and also to introduce a
standard retirement age for all judges and judicial officers.'
Lord Mackay intends that the new retirement age should apply to all those
appointed to full-time judicial office after the change comes into force.
Judges who hold full-time positions on the day the change is made will be
allowed to continue until the present retirement age of 75 provided they
remain in the same job and are not promoted. A change in judges' retirement
age will require primary legislation and so cannot be introduced until after
the election.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Japanese to school 'international ladies'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE property company Matsuzato is to open an academy for Japanese
women, with fees of Pounds 30,000 a year, at a Victorian country house near
Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.
The school, the first of its kind in the UK and probably in the world, aims
to produce graduates who are 'international ladies', fluent in English and
comfortable in the world of international business and diplomacy. The first
20 prospective 'international ladies', aged from 18 to 46, will arrive next
month.
Matsuzato, which already owns a golf course near Bury St Edmunds, has spent
about Pounds 5m on refurbishing Nowton Court, which was once a prep school
and is now renamed St Edmunds Ladies College. Five carpenters were flown
from Japan to construct a tea house, complete with tatami mats, and the chef
was sent to Tokyo to learn the basics of Japanese cuisine.
The idea for the project came from Mr Kanji Kusanagi, president of
Matsuzato, who was disillusioned with the Japanese education system.
Mr Teruhiko Fujiwara, who represents Matsuzato as director of administration
at the school, said: 'The company president found it too rigid. It is his
dream to have a school which is not so rigid, not restricted in the Japanese
style of education, more relaxed and international.'
English will be the main subject on the year-long course, but the students
will also take lessons in current affairs, menu planning, dance, golf and
'protocol'.
Most Japanese think of Britain as 'the country of ladies and gentlemen', as
the school prospectus puts it - an ideal place for the education of refined
young ladies. But St Edmunds insists that it is an academic institution
rather than a finishing school. All students will work towards recognised
English certificates.
Resident tutor Ms Helen Ledgard agrees that at Pounds 30,000 the fees are
high, but believes they offer good value. Full board and tuition, three
European tours a year, other trips and activities are all included. The
college is intended to be non-profit making.
By comparison, boarders' annual fees at Cheltenham Ladies' College are just
more than Pounds 10,000 and at Roedean Pounds 10,700 - although their
holidays are longer and conditions not so luxurious. At St Edmunds students
will each have a private bathroom. Language schools in London offer
full-time English courses for about Pounds 12,000 a year, but not including
travel and accommodation.
More than 20,000 Japanese come to Britain to study each year and the
majority are women, according to the education officer of the Japanese
embassy in London. He said: 'Male students are quite often sent by
companies, but female students support themselves. I think there is rather
strong motivation for women these days because they want to pursue their own
careers.'
Young Japanese women often have relatively well-paid office jobs but live
with their parents, saving most of their salaries for foreign travel and
shopping.
The school admits that most students are less likely to see themselves as
future ambassadors than as wives of diplomats or businessmen, but Ms Ledgard
hopes to 'develop their personalities, give them an all-round education and
enhance their confidence'.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Aerospace industry calls for more government aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AEROSPACE industry, struggling under defence cuts and the downturn in
civil business, is launching a campaign to coincide with the start of the
general election to seek greater government support.
On Monday the Society of British Aerospace Companies will send a series of
briefing papers to potential parliamentary candidates from all parties
warning them of the plight of the aerospace industry and the repercussions
on jobs and technology in industry as a whole.
The society warns that aerospace industry employment will fall as much as 25
per cent - or about 44,000 jobs  - between 1989 and this year because of
defence cuts and the civil aerospace recession. It estimates employment in
its 240 member companies will fall from 194,000 jobs in 1989 to about
150,000 by the end of this year. 'Further job losses will take place in
small companies providing services and goods to the aerospace industry,' it
says.
A society official said yesterday that aerospace workers were voters in 340
constituencies. Of these, two thirds were regarded as among the top marginal
constituencies in the forthcoming election.
Sir Ralph Robins, the chief executive of Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine
group, yesterday stressed that the UK aerospace industry required the same
'level playing field' as rival aerospace industries, which were facing the
same pressures of defence cuts and a downturn in civil orders.
He told the Aviation Club of Britain: 'Some of our foreign friends receive
considerable help from their governments. Either we have to stop these
governments doing this or we must join them and help our industry in the
same way.'
The society is pressing for a closer dialogue between companies and
government to ensure that the UK maintains the optimum defence industrial
base and leading-edge technological competence in spite of restructuring.
The decision to reduce defence equipment expenditure was taken by one
government department, the Ministry of Defence, but the industrial
restructuring has consequences for and requires action from several other
government departments including trade, transport and employment, the
society argues.
It also urges: Increased government investment in new space and civil
aerospace projects.
Government launch funds for civil aerospace projects should be expanded to
include components and avionics.
European Community recognition that the defence industry is facing permanent
change and use of structural funds to assist in the management of the
transition.
Government support for large aerospace companies considering investment in
fields outside their traditional activities.
A government policy on defence diversification to study possible conversions
from defence to civil activities.
A national technological assessment to be undertaken to identify core
technologies, research and development priorities, and opportunities for
technological transfer into new product areas.
The society says that restructuring will have significant implications for
the UK's technological and manufacturing base. However, it also emphasises
that the industry does not want a return to direct government intervention
in company decision-making but a more constructive dialogue with government.
Other important warnings include the danger that reduced research and
development expenditure in the UK would result in British companies losing
their technological edge. This would weaken their position in negotiations
to form joint ventures or collaborate in international partnerships by
making them junior partners in such ventures.
The society also warns of the impact of economic recession on the corporate
acquisition process. Cash-rich companies may acquire new businesses but many
hard-pressed defence companies would find it difficult to justify a rights
issue to make a strategic purchase. It adds that if acquisitions do take
place, they risk being in countries where business activity is recovering
faster than in the UK.
The society is sending to prospective parliamentary candidates three initial
briefing papers. But it plans to maintain the pressure by producing a number
of additional papers to underline what it believes is an urgent need for
greater government support and understanding for the UK's leading
manufacturing industry.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Writs issued over audits at BCCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WRITS were issued in the High Court yesterday alleging negligence and
claiming damages against Ernst &amp; Young over its 1986 audit of the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International's holding company and one of its two main
banking arms.
The issuing of the writs is the first of what is expected to be a flurry of
civil actions by administrators against advisers of the fraud-riddled bank
which was closed down last July by the Bank of England.
The writs, in the name of BCCI Holdings and BCCI SA, both registered in
Luxembourg, allege negligence, breach of duty and breach of contract over
their 1986 audits. Both banking entities are effectively under the control
of Mr Brian Smouha of Touche Ross though - unlike BCCI SA  - BCCI Holdings,
the holding company, is not yet in liquidation.
The writs, which were also issued in Luxembourg, need to be filed before
expiry of the five-year limit for bringing such actions under Luxembourg
law. The 1986 audit was signed off on March 10 1987.
Up to 1987 BCCI employed two sets of auditors for its main banks. Ernst &amp;
Young audited BCCI SA and Price Waterhouse audited BCCI (Overseas), based in
the Cayman Islands. The whole of the audit went to Price Waterhouse in 1987,
when Ernst &amp; Young became unhappy with the arrangement and refused to be
reappointed unless BCCI gave it the whole group. It also asked BCCI to make
commitments to strengthen management and systems.
One of the two writs lodged with the court yesterday named Ernst &amp; Whinney,
since this was the trading name of the partnership before it merged with
Arthur Young.
Under the liquidation agreement for BCCI, negotiated between Touche Ross and
Abu Dhabi but still to be approved by the Luxembourg court, the Sheikhdom
would share 50-50 in any damages recovered from advisers. The Abu Dhabi
government owns a majority stake in the bank.
The 1986 audit of BCCI covered an important period for it. In that year
Price Waterhouse carried out a review of treasury functions which proved to
be one of the bank's most disastrous operations. Price Waterhouse wiped
Dollars 225m off BCCI's profits for 1984 and 1985. The treasury losses were
discovered later, however, to have been far higher.
Mr Elwyn Eilledge, senior partner at Ernst &amp; Young, said: 'There are
circumstances where protective writs may be appropriate but we believe these
claims to be totally misconceived. We regret that this action is inevitably
at the expense of depositors and creditors.'

FT  07 MAR 92 / Safeguard for buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday announced moves to prevent mortgage lenders forcing
home-buyers to purchase unwanted insurance policies and other financial
services as a condition of a loan, David Barchard writes.
It said it planned to stop the 'tying' of one financial service to a
mortgage. However, it would not ban deals in which a mortgage is cheaper
because it is combined with other financial services, provided that
consumers are not misled.
Many consumers have complained that they may be forced to stop an existing
insurance policy and switch to another to obtain a mortgage. When a
home-buyer is forced to surrender an endowment policy from one company and
switch to another, it usually involves a substantial loss to the person
concerned.
The government proposals would mean that every lender would have to make
clear to customers whether the availability of a secured loan was linked to
the purchase of another service.
For mortgage loans, lenders and brokers would have to stress as soon as a
customer inquired about a mortgage that they were willing to provide the
loan by itself.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Fimbra plan on home bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROCEDURE to help people in financial difficulties after taking on
investment bond home income schemes - designed for elderly people to borrow
against the value of their homes while continuing to live in them - to
register complaints was announced by the Securities and Investments Board
yesterday, Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes.
People who invested in such schemes on the recommendation of members of
Fimbra, the regulatory body for independent financial advisers, will be able
to take complaints direct to Fimbra. Previously, related complaints - for
example, about the insurance company whose bond was sold or the solicitor
dealing with the mortgage documents - would have gone to separate regulatory
organisations.
In the simplest home income plans, the house is remortgaged to buy an
annuity which pays an income until death. The capital is kept by the
insurance company when the owner dies. There have been few problems with
these plans.
Investment bond schemes are much riskier. The homeowner invests in an
insurance bond, the value of which can fluctuate with the market.
The value of some such bonds fell at the same time as interest rates rose
and house prices dropped - creating substantial losses for the investor.
Many pensioners were sold these policies, even though they were virtually
banned by the regulators, which have encouraged victims to report those
selling them.
Investors losing money as a result of unsuitable advice from a Fimbra member
are entitled to compensation under the Investors Compensation Scheme as long
as the advice was given on or after August 28 1988, when the scheme came
into existence.

LONDON ZOO is no longer in danger of closure, it announced yesterday.
The zoo, run by the Zoological Society of London at Regent's Park, says it

Fifty-nine jobs were lost in a cost-cutting exercise, and animal numbers
were reduced through transfers to other zoos. A fund-raising campaign has so

FT  07 MAR 92 / Ashdown hardens stance on devolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH devolution would have to be included in an agreed four-year
programme of government if the Liberal Democrats were to form a coalition in
a hung parliament, Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, said yesterday, Ralph
Atkins writes.
Speaking ahead of his party's spring conference in Glasgow this weekend, Mr
Ashdown went further than before in detailing his terms for supporting
either Labour or the Tories - and in appeasing the strong devolutionist wing
in his party. Ten of the 22 Liberal Democrat MPs represent Scottish
constituencies.
Mr Ashdown reiterated that if a Queen's speech were introduced by either of
the other parties without promising proportional representation, he would
vote against it even if it contained pledges on Scottish devolution. He
argues that without reform at Westminster, a Scottish parliament introduced
by a minority government would be 'a flash in the pan'.
Liberal Democrat terms for a coalition also include an agreed programme of
government. Mr Ashdown denied reports that it would have to include a fourth
Trident submarine, but said: 'It is inconceivable that this party would not
include, in that programme, legislation for a Scottish parliament.'

FT  07 MAR 92 / Late bet placed on the big numbers game: The likely winners
and losers from the proposal for a national lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE surprise about yesterday's proposal from the government to launch a
national lottery is that it has not come sooner.
Britons gamble about Pounds 240 each a year, more per head than most other
nations. But the UK is the only country in Europe without a lottery - even
Albania has succumbed to the temptation of big prizes for a small outlay.
The principle of lottery financing in the UK is not new, but the last
lottery ended in 1826 following allegations of fraud and malpractice and the
growth of illegal betting.
Lotteries in other countries have gone from strength to strength. The
biggest spenders are Americans, where 90m punters splash out Pounds 12bn a
year, with a staggering Pounds 5.5bn returned in prize money. Most states
have a lottery, with California and Florida running the biggest.
Some states have found that the initial enthusiasm wears off, however, and
ticket sales can start to fall.
The biggest national lottery in Europe is in Spain, where customers spend
Pounds 3.4bn each year on tickets - Pounds 64 per head of population. The
Christmas payout - known as El Gordo, the fat one  - has reached Pounds 115m
and is a national event.
In Britain the government believes that a single national lottery, which
could be launched in 1994, should raise about Pounds 1bn a year for sports,
the arts, heritage and charities. A third of money from ticket sales would
probably go to these causes, and 15 per cent would be deducted for
administration, including advertising and promotion. The remainder would go
in taxes and prizes of up to Pounds 1m.
What remains unclear is who the winners from the introduction of a lottery
will be - apart from the direct beneficiaries  - and who will stand to lose
most. The uncertainty stems from differing views on whether lottery stake
money would be syphoned from other forms of gambling, or whether it would be
additional cash staked on the long-odds chance of winning a fortune.
The most obvious losers, and the most vocal opponents of a national lottery,
are football pools promoters, which fear their businesses will be damaged
beyond repair with big job losses, particularly in Liverpool.
Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters employ more than 6,500 and a further 70,000
as part-time collectors. The companies' anxieties stem from the fact that
the French national lottery, for example, is run by 400 people.
Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, said yesterday there was no evidence that
the pools would be badly affected, but if they were 'there are measures we
could take to change existing controls'. He also suggested that pools
promoters form a consortium to bid for the franchise to run the lottery, a
course which could also be followed by bookmakers or versely affected.
Last year the pools promoters headed off the threat of a national lottery in
a secret deal with the Treasury, the department most opposed to a lottery
because of the potential loss of other gambling taxes. In return for a 2.5
per cent reduction in pools betting tax, the companies agreed to contribute
Pounds 40m a year to the Foundation for Sport and Art, which makes grants to
more than 100 sports bodies and arts organisations. Objections from
opponents have been overwhelmed by the perceived political attractions of a
lottery, and by the prospect of continental European lottery tickets - at
present illegal  - flooding into the UK with the introduction of the single
market next year.
Other big losers could be promoters of charity lotteries - there were 855 in
1990-91, generating nearly Pounds 15m - and the government intends to
consult charities before framing legislation.
The Arts Council said it was delighted that the lottery had been given the
go-ahead, and the Sports Council said it was 'tremendous news' for sport.
There is certain to be criticism of the proposal from church leaders and
others on the moral implications.
Research from every country with a national lottery - most recently the
Republic of Ireland - shows that poorer sections of the community stake a
higher share of disposable income than the better-off.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Tory backbenchers protest government leasehold plans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY backbenchers protested in the Commons yesterday that planned government
legislation to give all leaseholders in England and Wales the right to buy
the freehold of their property would penalise owners of houses in central
London while enabling leaseholders to 'make a killing'.
Mr William Benyon, Conservative MP for Milton Keynes, said it was a 'curious
proposal' by Conservative ministers, while Mr Steve Norris, Conservative MP
for Epping Forest, described it as 'an unConservative measure' involving the
forced sale of assets.
Mr Benyon said it would give 'an enormous immediate tax free capital gain'
to leaseholders at the expense of the current freeholder.
Questioning why residents in Eaton Square deserved so generous a 'windfall',
Mr Benyon suggested that the dissolution of the monasteries provided the
closest parallel to such an arbitrary transfer of property from one section
of the population to another.
Mr Norris, who declared his interest in Haven Services, a company which
included sheltered accommodation among its 4,000 properties, urged the
government to recognise that there were profound 'anti-libertarian' issues
at stake.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Aristocratic families set to lose a pile over leasehold
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWENTY-FIVE years after the Leasehold Reform Act fundamentally altered the
rights of landowners, Sir George Young, housing minister, this week
announced plans for extending its reach.
The proposed changes, which have cross-party support, go to the heart of the
age-old political issue of property rights and will transform ownership of
some of the most historic parts of London.
The proposals to give all leaseholders the right to buy their freehold has
provoked bitter exchanges between leaseholders and their freeholders,
notably the aristocratic families who see themselves as guardians of their
estates for future generations.
The beneficiaries will be leaseholders with houses capable of commanding
rents of more than Pounds 25,000 a year, which were excluded from the right
to buy under the 1967 act.
The Leasehold Enfranchisement Association, comprising more than 2,000
households, says leaseholders are at the mercy of house-price fluctuations,
are in an unfairly weak bargaining position with their landlord, face big
bills for repairs or to renew their leases, and risk becoming homeless when
leases expire.
Mr Jeremy Newsum, chief executive of the Grosvenor Estate, owner of the
elegant, stuccoed terraces and mews houses of Mayfair and Belgravia, says
the government's proposals 'amount to a massive infringement of two
long-standing democratic principles: the right for a private citizen to own
and enjoy his private property as he wishes, and to uphold contracts freely
entered into'.
He says the proposals will cause the break-up of the 300-year-old Grosvenor
Estate and amount to confiscation.
The Grosvenor Estate argues that leasehold reform should be aimed at
improving bad practices, rather than affecting good and bad landlords alike.
Mrs Joan South of the Leasehold Enfranchisement Association says the great
estates of central London are as rapacious as any other landlord. 'Forty
years ago the Grosvenor Estate was very much more gentlemanly. Now it is run
by people who have been to business school.'
The aristocratic landowners say the appearance of central London may
deteriorate without their influence.
Their critics counter that listed building regulations, planning controls
and conservation areas have reduced the need for custodians such as the
Grosvenor Estate.
Another dispute centres on whether the changes will increase the stock of
houses available for rent.
Mr Stuart Corbyn, chief executive of the Cadogan Estate, says: 'If the
government gets its way, there will be nobody buying residential
investments.' The proponents of change say it will make no difference as
leases of under 21 years are not affected.
The break-up of the large estates is likely to take decades. The Cadogan
Estate found that after the 1967 act, leaseholders tended to buy their
freehold when they planned to sell the property.
Freeholders and leaseholders are divided on the question of compensation.
The Tories propose that landlords should be compensated with the market
value of the property, plus half the 'marriage value' from putting the
leasehold and freehold together.
Leaseholders think they will not be able to afford market rates and claim
that they have added to the value of the property. The estates argue that
the occupier will get an undeserved windfall gain from receiving half the
'marriage value'.
Labour says agreement will have to be reached between leaseholder and
freeholder, with recourse to an arbitration panel if necessary.
Leasehold reform can be expected in the next parliament, extending to flats
for the first time in England and Wales.
Last summer the government announced proposals that would affect about
250,000 leaseholders in flats, many of whom feel they pay too much in
service charges, wait too long for repairs and encounter difficulties in
selling their properties because building societies are unwilling to lend
money on short leases.
Both Labour and the Tories support a new form of tenure called commonhold as
a means of sharing a freehold between a group of owners of flats.
The move to compulsory commonhold has been attacked by professionals - the
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors thinks disagreements between
commonholders will be difficult to resolve and would seriously jeopardise
the position of the minority who do not vote for enfranchisement.
Whatever the possible problems, there is little doubt that commonhold would
be popular with owners of flats. This has not escaped the attention of
politicians. The concentration of dissatisfied owners of flats in marginal
constituencies in London, such as Hampstead, Dulwich, Westminster North,
Kensington and Wandsworth, has probably concentrated politicians' minds even
more sharply on reform.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Lime Street directors had Pounds 400,000 in bonuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK, RICHARD LAPPER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of Lime Street Underwriting Agencies, the Lloyd's members' agency
which went into liquidation yesterday, paid themselves Pounds 400,000 in
bonuses in June.
Heavy losses have been incurred by Names recruited to Lime Street, who were
placed in some of the syndicates with the greatest losses in recent years,
such as Gooda Walker 387, for which 1989 losses are now estimated at seven
times the assets pledged by Names - the individuals whose assets underwrite
insurance business at Lloyd's.
Meanwhile, the principal route used by MPs to make public allegations about
problems at the Lloyd's insurance market appears to have been blocked. Mr
Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, said he had been told by parliamentary
authorities that the Speaker would accept no further Lloyd's-related motions
in the current parliament.
Details of the Lime Street payments came at a creditors' meeting yesterday,
after a decision by the directors to put the company into creditors'
voluntary liquidation with net current liabilities of Pounds 476,000.
The bonuses were shown in unaudited accounts for the 19 months to February
1992. Bonuses in the previous three years had ranged from Pounds 20,000 to
Pounds 55,000.
After board approval last June Mr Patrick Corbett was awarded Pounds
150,000, Mr Richard Gethin-Jones and Mr Robin Kingsley Pounds 100,000 each
and Mr Robert Hallum Pounds 50,000. None was willing to say whether that
money would be returned.
Mr Ian Bond, a partner with Cork Gully and one of the liquidators, told the
meeting that Names had given notification by last Thursday of claims
totalling Pounds 21m.
Mr Robin Kingsley, founder of Lime Street and a series of associated
companies, came under repeated questioning from disgruntled Names yesterday.
They demanded to know why they were so heavily represented on loss-making
syndicates such as 387.
Mr Kingsley said he placed Names on 387 because it had performed better than
other syndicates on average in the past and gave a spread of risk across
Lloyd's. 'I am absolutely mortified by what happened. I could not be more
sorry,' he said.
Mr Hain, whose motion urging an inquiry into the Lime Street agency was
printed in Thursday's order paper, said he was seeking an interview with the
Speaker - Mr Bernard Weatherill  - to discuss the apparent blocking of
motions on Lloyd's.
The Speaker has already served warning that he would not tolerate the use of
early day motions - which enable allegations to be published under the
protection of parliamentary privilege - to mount concerted campaigns.
More than 1,500 Names facing losses of more than Pounds 150m on Feltrim
syndicates 540 and 847 in the 1989 underwriting year will not have to meet
cash calls which had been scheduled for April 30.
The syndicate's managers confirmed yesterday that the calls had been
cancelled.
Agreement is close in the long-running Outhwaite case. Eighty-one Lloyd's
agents yesterday accepted the terms of a Pounds 116m out-of-court settlement
with about 1,000 Outhwaite Names who were members of Outhwaite syndicate
317/661 in the 1982 year. The Names ratified the settlement on Wednesday.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Bank of Japan spurns pleas on monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Japan yesterday dismissed calls to ease monetary policy after
its latest survey of business showed the weakest outlook in four years, with
profits and capital spending plans declining sharply. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
the prime minister, called for an early release of funds for public works
projects in an effort to stimulate the economy.
The central bank's quarterly survey of business, known as the Tankan, showed
a particularly depressed outlook for manufacturing industries. The index of
business conditions dropped 18 points from November to minus five in
February, the first dip below zero since November 1987 and the largest
quarterly decline since 1975.
It is open to question whether the bank is out of sync with the rest of the
country as the evidence that Japan's economy is rapidly weakening is piling
up. The sharp deterioration as shown by the Tankan has added fuel to calls
from political and business leaders for an early cut in interest rates. The
bank's official discount rate was cut by half a point to 4.5 per cent at the
end of December.
A Bank of Japan official said the bank saw no reason to alter its monetary
policy because of the survey, and had not revised its view on economic
growth. The effects of the last cut in rates were still not fully realised.
While the economic expansion rate was slowing, the underlying tone of the
economy remained firm.
The apparent denial of any need to cut interest rates is deceptive. This is
because a further cut in rates soon would be fully consistent with current
policy, which has been to loosen monetary conditions since last July by
three half-point cuts in the official discount rate (ODR).
It is doubtful whether lowering interest rates would do any more in Japan to
stimulate the economy than it has done in the US. 'The Tankan tells us an
ODR cut will do nothing to get the economy going,' said Mr Jesper Koll,
economist at SG Warburg in Tokyo. Instead, a fiscal stimulus of the sort
advocated by Mr Miyazawa was needed.
The Tankan shows a sharp slowdown in the economy, easing of prices, cuts in
capital spending, a slackening labour market, and an increase in inventories
of the sort that could eventually prove to be a real recession, rather than
just the slowdown already confirmed.
Profits in manufacturing industry, excluding oil refining, were expected to
fall 16.4 per cent in the fiscal year ending March 31. A further decline of
0.3 per cent is forecast for next year, with a 5.8 per cent increase
forecast for the second half of the fiscal year.
Non-manufacturing profits, excluding electricity and gas, are expected to
decline by 4.8 per cent in the current year, and grow by 2.1 per cent next
year.
The reason that easing of interest rates may not have a strong impact on the
economy is that spending is being cut and inventories are piling up, even as
companies report an easing of credit markets. The central bank has
repeatedly said corporate liquidity remains adequate and is not a constraint
on spending. Weak demand and falling profits are.
Similarly, labour market indices show a gradual easing, especially in
manufacturing industries, even though labour supply remains generally tight.
The survey showed a sharp easing of inflationary pressure in both input
prices and manufactured goods prices. The index reflecting excess
inventories has risen steadily from 6 a year ago to 31 in February, although
the bank argued that inventory levels would come down in the next quarter.
Perhaps the most disturbing figure in the report is the reported 11.8 per
cent cut in capital spending plans in the fiscal year starting in April,
including a 14.2 per cent decline in manufacturing industry. The fall in
capital spending, which accounts for more than 20 per cent of GNP, is
expected to speed up in the second half.

FT  07 MAR 92 / S Africa's right wing exploits nation's fear: Conservative
referendum tactics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'REJECT the anti-Christ.' That is the level at which South Africa's
ultra-right Conservative Party (CP) has pitched its campaign for a 'no' vote
in next week's referendum on the future of apartheid.
For the most part, the CP campaign is not rational, but then, elections
never are. When it comes to exploiting the emotions and fears of the
Afrikaner, few political leaders are more effective than the CP leader
Andries Treurnicht, who today takes his message to the Afrikaner capital,
Pretoria.
He will address a CP rally from the steps of Pretoria's monument to Paul
Kruger, president of the 19th-century Transvaal republic, and one of
Afrikanerdom's best-loved heroes. If Mr Treurnicht follows the pattern of
previous campaign speeches, he will accuse the ruling National Party of
selling out to the African National Congress (ANC) and its ally, the South
African Communist Party (alias the anti-Christ); he will cite frightening
crime statistics, including murders of elderly Afrikaans farmers; he will
condemn the appalling state of the economy.
Backing his rhetorical skills will be the firebrand Mr Eugene Terre'blanche,
leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB), or Afrikaner
Resistance Movement, himself a powerful orator, and Mr Jaap Marais of the
Herstigte Nasionale Party (Reconstituted National Party). It will be a
formidable array of right-wing force.
For the Conservative Party, this is the mother of all battles; the party
knows it will not lose to fight another day. If the CP cannot muster a
majority for the 'no' campaign, party insiders predict it will split along
fault lines.
Over the past 10 days, an influential group of younger, more moderate CP
members of parliament - led by the witty and articulate Mr Koos van der
Merwe, MP for Overvaal, near Johannesburg - have sought to hijack party
policy from older reactionaries who propose a return to apartheid in all its
glory, and all its lunacy.
Unilaterally, they have announced major reversals of policy which have
caught more senior leaders off guard. Mr van der Merwe has announced that
the CP would not reinstate apartheid. This is largely sleight of hand:
apartheid laws would not be needed in the white homeland which Mr van der
Merwe proposes, because blacks would not be citizens of such a state.
Mr van der Merwe also announced that the CP was willing to negotiate
political reform with blacks. Official party policy has been to boycott the
Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the multi-racial forum
which is currently negotiating a new constitution. Mr van der Merwe insists
the party is ready to negotiate its demands for a white homeland, though he
says he would join Codesa only if its voting laws were changed.
The CP has also compromised on its central demand, that there should be an
independent Afrikaner homeland, part of a larger confederation of other
regional - that is, black  - states. That, of course, was the original plan
of apartheid: a constellation of black states federated to a large white
nation. The difference is that old-style apartheid called for whites to
occupy over 80 per cent of South Africa; the new CP policy is in favour of a
much smaller white state.
But many 'no' voters will probably be voting less for a white homeland than
against the prospect that the National Party will hand over power to the
black majority.
The large number of right-wingers who oppose such an outcome will not
disappear even if they lose the referendum. In fact, they could prove even
more dangerous. For if the CP loses, many Conservatives will feel that the
constitutional route to opposing reform has been blocked: a hard core is
likely to resort to violence, while the rest would form a 'new right' which
could be expected to enter negotiations.

<TEXT>
THE US has reversed its opposition to the sale of fibre-optic
telecommunications equipment to the Commonwealth of Independent States,
paving the way for greatly expanded sales to the former Soviet states,
writes Nancy Dunne from Washington.
Formal agreement to ease multilateral export controls on telecommunications
is expected at the next meeting of Cocom, the Co-ordinating Committee for
Multilateral Export Controls based in Paris, which is due in June at the
latest.
The US had opposed the introduction of these changes during the 'shaky
period' after the Soviet coup. It is now US proposing an easing rather than
an end to telecommunications controls. Sales would be allowed of
medium-speed systems for use between CIS cities and of top-speed systems for
international communications. Controls would continue for technology for use
near military and nuclear facilities.
This would rule out the proposed trans-Siberian fibre optics transmission
system.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BAKU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE worsening military situation in Azerbaijan appears to have played into
the hands of opposition nationalist leaders, who yesterday forced the
resignation of President Ayaz Mutalibov.
Mr Mutalibov, himself a more moderate nationalist, had earlier said: 'The
people elected me and only they must dismiss me.' But the former leader of
the Azerbaijan Communist party was persuaded to go with a Rbs10,000-a-month
pension and a promise to retain five bodyguards.
Elected president last September, Mr Mutalibov lost control as thousands of
demonstrators demanded his resignation. Cars toured the streets, horns
blaring, and 30,000 protesters paraded around the parliament building waving
nationalist flags and shouting 'Freedom]'
Looking exhausted after a two-day battering from opposition deputies in
parliament, and slurring his words, Mr Mutalibov said he was stepping down
because he feared aggression against Azerbaijan.
Chief among the opposition nationalists who now hold the balance of power,
as conflict sharpens with neighbouring Armenia over the disputed territory
of Nagorno-Karabakh, are Mr Etibar Mamedov and Mr Ragim Gajiev. They led
criticism by deputies of Mr Mutalibov for signing a treaty in Minsk last
month on the formation of a united military force for the Commonwealth of
Independent States and have called for increased discipline, foreshadowing a
possible military government.
The republic's forces has suffered defeats at the hands of Armenian
guerrillas, and authority has passed to a national council of parliament,
drawn from nationalist parties and the former communist groups. Mr Gusan
Gusanov, the prime minister, has been charged with forming a new coalition
cabinet. Mr Gusanov told the parliament that 'those who have lost the war
(with Armenia) must be dismissed'.
New parliamentary elections and a referendum on whether Azerbaijan will be a
presidential or a parliamentary republic are promised once the situation has
stabilised.
Mr Gajiev said after the session that 'now we hope to achieve real
independence for Azerbaijan - though it is one of the most difficult periods
in the people's history'.
Reports from Azerbaijan sources in Nagorno-Karabakh indicated that the
Commonwealth of Independent States military, which has been pulling out of
the enclave, has captured the towns of Khodjali and Askeran. Other reports
said that the towns had been taken by Azerbaijani forces.
Last night Armenia said Azerbaijani forces had attacked villages in
Nagorno-Karabakh with tanks and artillery, and accused Baku of exaggerating
the scale of an alleged massacre of Azerbaijanis to mask the offensive.
Intensive fighting was reported in several areas, with scores of people said
to be killed or wounded and many others missing.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Christian Democrat Jean-Luc Dehaene was named prime minister of a new
Belgian centre-left coalition government late yesterday, ending a
103-day-old political impasse.
King Baudouin confirmed him as head of government after the Christian
Democrats and Socialists approved a government platform to control a runaway
budget deficit and tackle urgent social problems.
The Socialist Willy Claes was named foreign minister and the Christian
Democrat Philippe Maystadt stays on as finance minister.
Mr Dehaene replaces Mr Wilfried Martens, western Europe's longest-serving
premier. A senior Flemish Christian Democrat like Mr Martens, he has coaxed
Christian Democrats and socialists from both sides of the French-Flemish
language divide into a coalition and was negotiating yesterday over further
ministers.
Mr Dehaene, 51, was vice-premier and communications minister in the last
government. He worked out agreement on a coalition after the 1988 election,
but his friend and patron Mr Martens was appointed to the top job, a post he
has held almost continuously for nearly 13 years.
Mr Martens, 55, could now take over as chairman of the Senate, Belgium's
upper chamber, if he is not given a ministry.
The new Belgian government will probably contain only 16 ministers, about
half the usual number, charged with an emergency legislative programme. They
will try to tackle further constitutional reform, the issue which brought
down the last Martens government, but Mr Dehaene may also face problems
here.
The four coalition parties all lost seats in the election and political
opponents are already calling this 'the government of the vanquished'.
It will command 120 seats in the 212-seat parliament, and will have to curry
favour with other parties to gain the two-thirds majority needed before
further powers can be devolved to the Belgian regional authorities.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Low mark for some top public schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY of England's famous public schools emerge well down the list of
academic achievement, according to the FT-500 survey of independent schools
published today.
Seven of the top 12 independent schools in England and Wales are former
direct-grant schools, which used to award a proportion of their places to
state-funded students until the last Labour government abolished the scheme.
The FT-500, one of the most comprehensive surveys of independent education
in Britain yet published, ranks schools by an analysis of last year's
A-level results. It also details fee levels and gives performance indicators
such as the percentage of students going on to higher education.
Two Birmingham schools head the list - King Edward's (for boys) and King
Edward VI (for girls), closely followed by Portsmouth High. Winchester, in
fourth place, is the leading public school.
The survey gives a boost to day and single-sex schools. Only one school in
the top 30 is co-educational - and that just in the sixth form. Only two of
the top 12 are predominantly boarding.
Impressive standards are achieved at the top: within the leading 20, pupils
secure an average A-level grade of B. But less than a third of pupils take

FT  07 MAR 92 / Thorn EMI pays Branson Pounds 510m for Virgin Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD BRANSON yesterday sold Virgin Music Group, the world's largest
independent record company, to Thorn EMI for Pounds 510m in cash.
The deal, agreed after 14 months of talks, means Thorn, the UK music,
rentals and light fittings group, shoots straight into the top league of
world music groups, with turnover of more than Pounds 1.3bn and a share of
about 18 per cent of the world market.
It also consolidates the transformation made by Thorn in the past five
years, shedding more than 60 companies to concentrate on music and equipment
rental.
Virgin Music, created 20 years ago by Mr Branson, brings to Thorn artists
such as the Rolling Stones, Phil Collins, Genesis and UB40.
It adds the copyright to 25,000 songs to Thorn's catalogue of 800,000
titles, which already includes Singing In The Rain, Over The Rainbow and
Happy Birthday To You.
Mr Branson said yesterday that the Rolling Stones had told him when they
signed with Virgin at the end of last year that they would be untroubled if
the company were taken over by Thorn.
Mr Branson added: 'It's also important to me that we managed to reach an
agreement with a British company.'
Mr Branson will receive nearly Pounds 380m from the sale, part of which he
is expected to invest in the expansion of his airline Virgin Atlantic
Airways, and the Virgin Megastore chain of shops in the UK, Japan and
continental Europe.
The price also marks a substantial profit for Fujisankei Communications, the
Japanese conglomerate, which three years ago paid Dollars 150m for 25 per
cent of the music group. Mr Branson also remains president for life of
Virgin Music, and said yesterday: 'I get a really enormous salary but I
won't tell you what it is.'
Thorn is financing the acquisition by a one-for-four rights issue at 650p, a
17 per cent discount on yesterday's opening price of 785p, to raise Pounds
516m net of expenses.
Because the deal is conditional on EC regulatory clearance, the issue falls
in two parts. Shareholders will pay 40 per cent of the price immediately,
and the balance on clearance and completion of the deal. If the deal is not
cleared, the company will use the Pounds 211m raised from the first
instalment to reduce debt.
In the year to July 1991, Virgin Music made operating profits of Pounds
21.2m on turnover of Pounds 330.1m, compared with EMI Music's sales of
Pounds 1.016bn and profits of Pounds 109m.
Thorn takes on Pounds 50m of debt within Virgin Music Group. Mr Colin
Southgate, Thorn's chairman, said yesterday its manufacturing and
distribution, which Virgin lacked, would bring immediate savings. He expects
to treble Virgin Music's profits in the first full year. On that basis,
Thorn has told shareholders it expects no earnings dilution after the first
year. The market welcomed that estimate, marking up the shares 21p at 806p.

Labour bites back: Angus, a West Highland terrier, and his owner, Mr Bryan
Gould, shadow environment secretary, yesterday endorsed the opposition's
claim to be political market leaders on animal welfare, writes Ivo Dawnay.
Labour's bid for the animal-loving vote, only days after the Liberal
Democrats launched their policy, is based on evidence that electors prefer
policies friendly to the furry and disenfranchised. A Mori poll for the
International Fund for Animal Welfare has shown that kindness to animals
could be worth up to 2 crucial percentage points in 52 marginal seats.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Tories pledge to launch national lottery by 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NATIONAL lottery to raise up to Pounds 1bn for Britain's arts, heritage,
sports and charities will be introduced by 1994 if the Conservatives retain
power at the general election.
The UK is the only country in western Europe without a national lottery and
opinion polls suggest that more than 70 per cent of Britons would approve of
one.
A white paper published yesterday set out the form the lottery is likely to
take, including the allocation of cash by an independent National Lotteries
Board, management of the lottery by private sector contractors and prizes of
up to Pounds 1.5m.
Authorities in the UK have not always been hostile to lotteries: the British
Museum was founded in 1753 with funds raised by public lottery. Recently
there has been growing pressure for a national lottery as a way of raising
money for sport and the arts, but it has faced strong opposition from
Treasury ministers who feared a big loss of revenue from taxes on football
pools and other forms of gambling.
These doubts have now been overwhelmed by a powerful combination of
ministers who see the promise of a lottery with big prizes as an election
vote-winner. The proposal will feature in the Tory election manifesto, and
legislation introduced in the first session of the new parliament if the
Tories remain in government.
Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, told the Commons that the lottery, with
50p or Pounds 1 tickets, should raise a gross Pounds 3bn or more each year.
About 35 per cent of the total would go to 'good causes', 15 per cent would
be used for administration and promotion, and the rest for prizes and tax.
The level of tax and the means of collecting it would be up to the
chancellor.
Mr Roy Hattersley, shadow home secretary, condemned the government's failure
to have talks with pools promoters before making an announcement 'primarily
intended to cobble together a few votes'.
But he added that a Labour government would give 'serious consideration' to
a lottery.
Mr Baker brushed aside the claims of Labour MPs that the football pools
would be unable to co-exist with a national lottery offering such big
prizes.
One possibility he raised was that the big pools companies could form a
consortium to bid for the franchise to run the national lottery.
The Pools Promoters' Association, which represents Littlewoods, Vernons and
Zetters, welcomed the government's acknowledgement of their special
circumstances and said they were ready to play a constructive part in talks
about the lottery. The three companies employ 6,500 people, mostly in the
Liverpool area, and fear big redundancies.
Both the arts and sports councils welcomed the white paper, while the
Charities Aid Foundation said it backed the lottery but was concerned at
some aspects of the proposals.

FT  07 MAR 92 / 4,000 Maxwell pensions cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 4,000 pensioners will suffer severe falls in their income from
July following the raid made on their pension fund by Mr Robert Maxwell, the
publishing tycoon who died last November, it was announced yesterday.
Pensions are likely to be cut by between a half and three-quarters.
These are the first people to be told of definite cuts in pension payments
as a result of the diversion of more than Pounds 400m of assets. Since then
30,000 current and former Maxwell employees have feared the loss of their
pensions.
The pensioners affected are members of the Maxwell Com munication Works
Pension Scheme (MWS), mostly from the printing industry. The scheme had
assets of Pounds 155m but only a small fraction of that money is left.
Mirror Group Newspapers, Mr Maxwell's British newspaper business, has been
using company funds to finance pension payments to MWS members, and will do
so until the end of June.
However, Mr Charles Wilson, editorial director of MGN, said MGN could no
longer fund the payments to non-MGN pensioners without jeopardising the
pensions of its own employees.
The news comes days before the Commons social security committee is expected
to report on the UK pension industry and Mr Maxwell. Mr Frank Field,
chairman of the committee, which is due to report on Monday, said pension
funds should be governed by company law, not trust law. He said: 'I think
voters will demand radical change.'
Kenneth Trench, of the Maxwell Pension Fund Association, said: 'What we are
calling for is a compensation scheme to be set up straight away.' He said
pensioners had been financially mugged. MGN took responsibility for the MWS
in 1989 when the pension schemes of nearly 90 Maxwell companies were
consolidated.
The MWS scheme will continue to pay reduced pensions from its remaining
assets and any assets recovered will go towards making good the shortfall in
payments.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Collecting: Art market begins to build a recovery led by Old
Masters - Hopeful signs in London's salerooms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUDDENLY, there are the first green sprouts of spring, suggesting a
re-awakening in the market for pictures as well. In New York at the end of
February, both Sotheby's and Christie's sold second division Impressionist
and Modern art well - 12 per cent unsold at Sotheby's and an impressively
modest 10 per cent bought-in at Christie's.
Of course, sellers had to be arm-twisted into putting low reserves on their
pictures, and prices generally were up to 50 per cent lower than two years
ago; but private collectors were back and bidding for run-of-the-mill works
by Chagall and Soutine, Utrillo, and even poor old Picasso. Above all, the
auctions were seen to be a success, encouraging greatly that elusive plant
called confidence.
It is the same in London. Agnews has had a tremendous response to the
portraits of 31-year-old Sarah Raphael, selling 80 per cent of her
exhibition in just three weeks at prices ranging up to Pounds 12,500. And,
next door in Bond Street, Marlborough did equally well with the landscapes
of Christopher Bramham. Both artists are accessible - very English in their
style but backed by sinewy strength.
More to the point, Agnews is confident of selling at least two of the
expensive Old Masters it is exhibiting as part of its 175th anniversary
show.
Across the road, Leger has one of its finest exhibitions for some time to
celebrate its centenary. It is offering British landscapes, ranging in price
from Pounds 1,000 to more than Pounds 1.5m for one of Gainsborough's most
brilliant late landscapes. The presentation of such high-quality pictures is
bound to entice buyers, particularly overseas museums which are largely
unaffected by financial uncertainties.
In Madrid, meanwhile, the Old Master sale of Edmund Peel was only 4 per cent
unsold, with a rare work by Yanez going to the Prado Museum for Pounds
435,555. In New York, there were particularly encouraging Old Master
auctions at both Sotheby's and Christie's. This has inspired the belief that
the revival in the picture market will be led by Old Masters, and there are
good historical reasons why this should be so.
In spite of the blandishments of the dealers, the Japanese - whose on-off
love affair with Impressionist and modern art caused the wild fluctuations
in their price, leading to the present sad slump - have never really
understood or collected Old Masters. Consequently, this sector escaped the
speculative fever and remained a connoisseur's market, bought by museums,
committed collectors and the odd bold spirit (like Madonna) who wanted to
move beyond the easy iconography of modern art.
There are undoubted problems with Old Masters such as those of attribution,
condition, subject matter, availability, and the fact that the great
masterpieces are invariably tucked away in museums. But they still represent
the greatest manifestation of western art, and the growth in art history has
opened up virtually every period, and country, to informed comment.
Discoveries and re-attributions are being made constantly - notably, in
recent months, the confirmation of an exquisite Raphael belonging to the
Duke of Northumberland; a Titian; and a Sebastiano. (The latter two are
leaving the UK for the Getty Museum in Malibu.)
It is not surprising, then, that when Christie's was asked by the Marquess
of Cholmondeley to find a buyer for his 'Portrait of a lady with pet
squirrel and a starling' by Holbein, it wanted to rush it to auction (on
April 15) rather than go through long, complicated, and perhaps unsuccessful
negotiations on a private treaty sale. A high-profile auction, achieving an
anticipated price of Pounds 15m-plus  - which would make it the most
expensive Old Master yet sold in the UK  - would galvanise the market,
particularly as two other fine works, by Rembrandt and Canaletto, could be
included in the same sale.
They, too, come from landed English families worried by the prospect of a
high-taxing Labour government after the general election and by the fact
that Arts Minister Tim Renton is proposing a list of national treasures that
cannot leave the UK. Of course, Christie's would also earn more money from
an auction than from a negotiated deal.
Christie's has run into a storm, though. The heritage lobby has rallied
behind keeping the Holbein in the UK and talks are under way on a possible
private treaty sale, to the National Gallery. After paying 60 per cent tax
on a market sale of the Holbein, Cholmondeley might actually do better
selling to the National - even if he has to wait three years for all his
money.
Undoubtedly, an auction would be a useful test of the strength of the art
market. There are only around 10 known bidders for the three paintings but,
at this quality level, a new mega-rich collector in another field could
possibly be persuaded to show an interest, especially in the Holbein.
Christie's is obviously doing what is best for Christie's but, in a strange
way, the successful sale of this rare painting would have a knock-on effect
right down to the hustlers in the Portobello Road.
For many dealers, this year will show little or no improvement on the
abysmal 1991; but the blocks on which the revival will be built are being
established slowly. It will rise on private buying rather than trade
bidding, for many dealers are over-stocked and debt-ridden.
In furniture and silver, jewellery and stamps, there have been some very
good auctions in recent weeks. Pictures, along with classic cars, felt the
full force of late-1980s' speculation and some sectors, like the
Impressionists, may take five years to recover to their 1989 price levels.
But Old Masters, which suffered least, are already displaying ingrained
strength. The furore over the Holbein just confirms their ability to stir up
strong emotions and to tap large sums of money.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Collecting: Big names go to Paris in springtime - Nicholas
Powell previews the Salon de Mars and the Salon du Dessin and sees plenty to
attract interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARCH and early April traditionally are a quiet time for Paris galleries but
dealers and collectors have two big events, the Salon de Mars and the Salon
du Dessin, to which they can look forward this year.
The fourth annual Salon de Mars will be held as usual under several acres of
white canvas on the lawns of the Champs de Mars in Paris, just by the Eiffel
Tower, from March 25-30. The often-startling mixture of periods and styles,
from pre-Columbian to the avant-garde contemporary which is the salon's
trademark, is as pronounced as ever.
Last year's event attracted 50,000 people and most serious buying was done
by French collectors. Broadly speaking, art priced at under FFr500,000 sold
easily but the market proved sluggish above that figure. Highly-priced
contemporary art was almost impossible to move but specialists in
less-speculative fields, such as art deco and African art, reported good
sales.
There are 115 stands this year, five fewer than 1991. Some leading Paris
dealers, such as medieval specialist Bresset, have preferred to stay away
and concentrate instead on the huge Biennale arts fair in September.
Twenty-four of this year's dealers have come from abroad, one fewer than in
1991; but only two are American, compared with nine two years ago when the
art market still was booming.
Although organisers are confident that the reputation of the Salon de Mars
is growing outside France, foreign dealers have been put off by their own
economic problems and the French government's swingeing increase in
value-added tax on art last summer. Although that rate was reduced in
December from 18.6 per cent to 5.5 for original art works, - the last of
several legislative turnabouts - the news came too late to help the salon.
The fair will, nevertheless, have two British exhibitors for the first time:
Richard Goedhuis, who deals in Oriental art, and contemporary art specialist
Stoppenbach and Delestre.
The quality of exhibits at the Salon de Mars has improved radically over the
past couple of years and the fair has begun to attract the trade's biggest
names such as Paris furniture dealers Perrin, Segoura and Etienne Levy.
Levy, who specialises in 20th century French mahogany furniture, is
presenting an unusual bookcase with incorporated bottle and cigar racks  -
ideal, he says, for 'a selfish, refined bachelor.' A Paris colleague, Jean
Gismondi, known best for highly-decorated 17th century Italian furniture, is
showing only French Empire furniture in mahogany.
The highly-specialised fields will be well represented, too. Gisele Croes, a
leading Chinese art specialist from Brussels; Parisian medievalist
Jacqueline Boccador; and African arts experts Alain de Monbrison and Helene
and Philippe Leloup (also from Paris) all are showing.
Presentation at the Salon de Mars is unfussy. At the Salon du Dessin, it is
positively austere. The stands are only 45 sq ft, the nondescript beige wall
hangings are the cheapest the organisers could find, and the potted plants
must be shared.
The salon was the first drawings fair in Europe, and the world's first
showing only original drawings to the exclusion of prints. It began last
year in basement rooms at the Hotel George V and proved so successful it is
being repeated from April 1-5.
Seventeen Paris dealers again are clubbing together for the show, which is
intended to give a further boost to the rapidly-developing Paris market in
drawings - and keep the proceeds at home. This year, though, the fair's only
contemporary dealer, Marwan Hoss, has dropped out and is replaced by Brame
and Lorenceau, who are leading specialists in late-19th century drawings and
paintings.
This year's salon, like the first, will be top-heavy in French 18th century
drawings of the sort the local public likes best (although dealers complain
such works are increasingly hard, and ever more expensive, to find). Galerie
Cailleux, which probably will have the best in that line, is presenting a
special homage to the artist Hubert Robert, with a selection of
architectural fantasies and studies of ancient Roman characters.
Galerie Proute, one of the city's most learned specialists in drawings and
engravings, is showing works by Rodin and Fragonard. Dutch-born dealer Bob
Haboldt, who last year had the finest choice of northern European works, is
proposing a mix this year with 17th and 18th century French works.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Collecting: Massive at Maastricht - The biggest art fair in
the world is growing bigger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE WHO already find the marathon circuit of The European Fine Art Fair
sufficiently exhausting may be dismayed to learn that this year the world's
largest art fair is bigger than ever.
Between March 14 and March 22, the Maastricht Exhibition and Congress Centre
(MECC) in the Netherlands, long since evacuated by Kohl, Major and
Mitterrand, is host to 144 dealers from ten countries, many exhibiting for
the first time, and a projected 27,000 visitors.
The expansion comes of a decision to broaden the base of the fair. Two new
specialist sections join ranks with 'Pictura', 'Antiquairs', 'Modern and
Contemporary Art' and 'Textura' this year: 'Gravura' (prints and works on
paper) and the grandiosely titled 'La Haute Joaillerie du Monde'.
Maastricht's success rests on a desire to refine and improve. Ever since the
city's two small biennial picture and antique fairs merged in 1985 and
relaunched three years later as an annual event at MECC, its formula has
been under constant revision. Some experiments were short-lived, such as the
Orangerie, the loan exhibitions, and last year's Italian pavilion. The
charity gala evening, the concert and lecture programmes remain regular
features to entice visitors to linger in medieval Maastricht.
Most inspired of all innovations was the introduction of 'Textura' in 1988,
a fair within a fair comprising a handful of Europe's most distinguished
dealers in carpets and textiles. The limitless and relatively inexpensive
space at MECC (which resembles nothing so much as a DIY warehouse on the
A40) makes it an ideal venue for exhibiting large-scale works of art. By
ensuring uniformly high standards (interestingly, last year's guests were
not invited back), the tight knot of exhibiting dealers have established
'Textura' as a centre of excellence and a magnet to specialist collectors.
An indication of the calibre of exhibits this year is The Rothschild
Medallion Hunting Carpet, woven in Isfahan around 1600, and presented by The
Textile Gallery, London. Only one other complete example of this grand and
enchanting 234 by 480cm rug is known.
Far from being afraid of competition, dealers at Maastricht have found that
a concentration of specialist stands has attracted more visitors and
business to all. The exhibitors will bring new clients as well as new blood.
According to Ben Janssens of Spink's and a member of the Maastricht board,
it was felt that jewellery would also lend 'a certain amount of prestige to
the fair.' He continues: 'Jewellers always seem to do a lot of business at
the Paris Biennale, and are pleased to have the opportunity to show at an
art fair'.
Their appearance suggests, too, that the organisers have realised at last
that stand after stand of middle-ranking Dutch and Flemish tavern scenes of
roistering peasants, marine pictures, still-lifes, and snowscenes is of
limited charm.
The jewellers are not only bringing serious rocks - complete with
certificates sprinkled with 'D flawless' - but objects more typical of a
Northern Schatzkammer. A tempting idea is 'The Cup of Euphoric Bliss'
offered by Gianmaria Buccellati of Milan, a 17th century vessel in the shape
of a swan and incorporating an antique piece of moss jasper, silver, gold
and emeralds. Swans seem to be popular. Garrard of London has a pair made of
modern sterling silver.
There is frivolity too - not always an inexpensive commodity. Cartier
International of Paris shows a characteristic ruby, diamond and platinum
brooch in the form of a coconut tree, and a 'Tutti Frutti' necklace. Harry
Winston of Paris and New York offers 'Ruby Slippers' - an exact replica of
Judy Garland's sparkling magic footwear in The Wizard of Oz made to mark the
50th anniversary of the film. They are crafted out of some 4,600 rubies.
Maastricht's location has always determined its bread and butter business:
Dutch and Flemish Old Master paintings. This year the fare is strengthened
by the return of London heavyweights Richard Green and Colnaghi. The latter
is back, according to the firm's Jeremy Howard, because there is no Palazzo
Strozzi fair in Florence this year, and 'everyone seemed to do rather well
at Maastricht last year.'
Richard Green takes, among other things, a flowerpiece by Jan Brueghel the
Elder of roses, tulips and iris in a Wanli porcelain kendi. Colnaghi,
Bloemaert's Caravaggesque 'Holy Family'. Dealer Charles Roelofsz's newly
discovered Terbrughen of a 'Women with a Candle' was the pictorial treat of
last year's show. It seems to have attracted more fashionable Northern
Caravaggesques. Spencer A Samuels brings from New York Terbrughen's
extraordinary 'Heraclitus and Democritus', and Schlichte Bergen of
Amsterdam, Jordaens' 'Bearded Man by Candlelight'.
Good traditional landscapes come in the form of Verner Amell's Ruisdael and
Noortman's Hobbema. What is interesting, however, is how much more variety
there seems to be among the pictures this year. Arnoldi-Livie of Munich
brings Rottenhammer and Menzel; Colnaghi, Bugiardini and Angelica Kauffmann
(a portrait of a daughter of a Scottish Governor of New York). We find
Oudry, Chardin and Boilly, Courbets and Corots. Martyn Gregory brings China
trade pictures. Even Johnny van Haeften's Frans Post, his most expensive
picture at Pounds 650,000, is a view of the Cathedral of Olinda in Brazil.
The range of the works of art on offer is impressive, increased this year by
the breadth of interests of the new exhibitors. At Maastricht one can
discover anything from an Attic amphora to Art Deco: Oriental porcelain,
pewter and grand French furniture, icons and Indian jewellery, maiolica,
Limoges and silver, even leather panels, architectural columns and picture
frames. Newcomer Luis Elvira of Castellon offers a terrifyingly beautiful
pair of 16th century Spanish-German tournament spurs; Kugel of Paris present
a set of five silvered and gilt bronze Dresden dwarves.
An original and particularly intriguing new field is opened up in the modern
and contemporary section. Hong Kong and London-based American dealer Ed
Miller brings contemporary Chinese art to our attention, under the umbrella
of Lo Shan Tang. Miller explains that almost no one outside Asia has ever
seen the best of modern Chinese painting, and plans to redress the balance.
'I've taken a huge stand at Maastricht,' he says, 'and am bringing great
stuff.'
There is nothing flamboyant about Maastricht (except perhaps the eccentric
parrot tulips that adorn the hall in splendid profusion). The displays are
simple and swagless, and the objects are left to speak for themselves.
Dealers seem to be 'cautiously optimistic', depending on the relative
strength of the economy in Continental Europe and of the sound good sense of
Continental collectors who have always prefered to use their income rather
than their capital - and certainly not credit - to buy works of art. A weak
dollar seems to have encouraged many US dealers to try their luck in Europe.
The fair is open 11am-8pm weekdays, 11am-6pm weekends. Sabena World Airlines
again offers a 50 per cent discount on all first and business class flights
to Brussels for visitors from anywhere in the world, except German-speaking
countries, and a regular mini-bus service between Brussels Airport Sheraton
and MECC. To take advantage of this offer, entrance tickets must be booked
in advance from The European Fine Art Foundation, (tel: 31-73-14-51-65) and
presented to a Sabena agent.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Collecting: Market puts on a genial face - Desperate US
dealers are even being polite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE ART market in New York is so much more genial these days. Dealers have
become positively welcoming - even polite  - and the auction-houses have
shed that attitude of disdain which went with their success in the eighties.
Even the public have changed. At the Benefit Preview of The Art Show - the
annual fair of the Art Dealers Association of America - the other week,
everyone seemed to be actually enjoying themselves. Not that anyone was
buying anything. On the contrary, in spite of the fact that a great deal of
what was on show was decidedly middle-of-the- road and prices (most of them
quite modest) were openly displayed, there was not a red dot to be seen. It
was all very different from not so long ago.
The year started with a huge emphasis on Old Masters. The auction-houses,
sensing that these are sound 'Blue Chip', are busy trying to encourage the
art-speculators, who have seen their investments in Contemporary Art
dwindle, to move into more traditional art: 'Crossover Collectors' are the
rage.
Sotheby's mid-January sale of almost 200 lots went relatively well with 69
per cent sold by lot and a surprising top price of Dollars 3.5m (Pounds 2m)
paid (by a New York dealer) for a Van Huysum flowerpiece (estimate Dollars
1.5m-Dollars 2m) painted about 1730. Christie's Old Master sale that week
had no comparable picture on offer but 78 per cent of the lots found buyers.
The same firm had a similar success with their Master Drawings sales: 77 per
cent sold by lot in an auction that was particularly strong on French
drawings with a Watteau topping the bill at almost a Dollars 250,000.
But a more exciting focus for collectors during January was away from the
auction-houses. Several Old Master Drawings dealers staged excellent
exhibitions and demonstrated the traditional attraction of buying from a
dealer rather than in the scramble of an auction. In a gallery such as Mia
Wiener's it is possible to study a wide range of well-researched and
beautifully displayed drawings, discuss them in depth with the dealer, and
educate one's taste in a way that is quite impossible in the saleroom.
Furthermore, most dealers are prepared to trade so that if one has a change
of mind - even after a number of years - it is generally possible to return
a purchase.
Mia Wiener's January show was called 'Regarding the Antique: aspects of
antiquity in Renaissance and Baroque Italy' and it included about 40
drawings inspired (primarily) by ancient Rome. These were displayed in the
company of a loan collection of classical bronzes and the muted effect of
the arrangement made a visit to the exhibition like dropping in on the study
of some humanist scholar.
Nissman, Abromson - who are based in Massachusetts  - also exhibited master
drawings in New York in January. Their collection, which they published in a
handsome catalogue, ranged from an early-18th century drawing of a cherub by
Marcantonio Raimondi to a sculptural study of Medusa by the English
pre-Raphaelite, Simeon Solomon.
New York-based drawings dealers Margot Gordon and Jill Newhouse
traditionally show every January (otherwise by appointment) and this year
they were joined by a relative newcomer, Richard Berman, who staged his
exhibition at the Explorers' Club on East 70th Street. The Hamburg dealer,
Thomas Le Claire, was in town for the first time with drawings dating from
the 16th to the 19th centuries.
Last October, Hazlitt, Gooden &amp; Fox opened new premises in New York and they
imported Italian drawings from Carpaccio to Tiepolo from their Bury Street
gallery for a January showing. London dealer, Richard Day, was also
available. All in all, Old Master drawings seemed the hottest ticket around
and business, although not exactly brisk, was said to be doing nicely.
For the collector who simply wants to browse, one of the most stimulating
(but least glittering) of New York's myriad art fairs is just a month away.
This is 'Works on Paper' which takes place at the Armory on Park Avenue (at
67th Street) on the weekend of April 3-5. Most dealers who had shows in
January will have stands. They will be joined by others who specialise in
prints, watercolours, illustrated books, architectural drawings, posters,
and photographs. This is quite a heady mix but the show traditionally
attracts serious collectors as well as museum curators from all over the
country.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Private View: A veteran keeper of the Olympic flame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Arthur Gold discusses the British sense of fair play and the Hellenic view
of sport
EURIPIDES was scornful. What use to his city, he asked, is a man who wins
prizes for wrestling, running, throwing the discus or smiting jaws?
The old tragedian's cynicism was premature, perhaps. But the spirit of the
Olympic Games was indeed eventually undermined by bribery, professionalism
and politics.
The nadir came when the Emperor Nero won a gold medal in the AD 67 chariot
race in spite of being the sole contestant and failing to finish. After an
unbroken run of nearly 1,200 years (some say even longer) the Games were
abolished in the year 393.
Yet the spirit lingered on, especially in philhellene England: the Cotswold
Olympics were staged in 1636 and the Much Wenlock Olympic Society was formed
in 1850. And when Baron de Coubertin resurrected the Games in 1896 one of
the first gold medallists was a young British scholar, George Robertson, who
happened to be on holiday in Athens and submitted a Pindaric ode.
Those were the days.
What would Euripides have said if he had been at this year's winter Olympics
in Albertville and seen men in luminous zoot-suits and Darth Vader helmets
hurtle down near-vertical ski slopes at 130 mph? What verdict would he pass
on the summer Games coming up in Barcelona?
One man who has tried to shield the pure Olympic flame from polluting airs
is Sir Arthur Gold: high jumper, team leader at Mexico, Munich and Montreal,
doyen of British athletics' officials and, at 75, still chairman of the
British Olympic Association.
I asked him to define the Olympic spirit - or 'ethos' as he prefers to call
it.
'Oh, dear. You may as well ask Dr Johnson how he arrived at the meaning of
words in his dictionary]
'I tend to use 'ethos' because it's a nebulous word. Sport is a cross
between politics and religion. You can't define sport as such. And the
Olympic ethos means doing something not necessarily for profit or for
position but for the satisfaction of knowing that on that particular day you
were the best.
'It's an awfully trite thing to say, but the victory itself is a bonus on
top of doing something that you enjoy - or should enjoy.'
Sir Arthur clearly enjoyed his own athletics. In the real world, he runs the
family garage business, a repair shop and Renault franchise in north London.
(His grandfather was a hansom cab proprietor). But once established as an
international high jumper, though he missed Hitler's 1936 Olympics by a
whisker, he went on competing until the age of 43.
Adopting the Eastern Cut-off (this was before things like the Fosbury Flop
were allowed, giving jumpers another foot) he achieved a best of 6ft 3in,
and is proud of the fact that for 28 consecutive seasons he never vaulted
less than 5ft 8in.
I reminded him of the fate of the ancient Games and asked whether the modern
Olympiad was heading in the same direction.
'Sadly, we've got human nature at work. The original games lasted for more
than a thousand years; things happen much more rapidly these days. I would
have to be a great optimist to think ours would survive the intrusions of
commerce and politics for the next thousand years. I doubt it.
'There is a very real danger for the Games now. Particularly since 1984, the
International Olympic Committee has been conscious of the vast sums to be
made from sponsors and television. In the pursuit of television coverage
they may make some unwise decisions.'
By this he meant the temptation to promote sports popular on television  -
tennis, soccer, even baseball - at the expense of traditional athletics. But
these sports all have their own world championships, and the Olympics would
be second-best.
'You could find the IOC, accustomed to living in champagne style, reduced to
a ginger beer pocket.'
What, I said, do you think of events like ice dancing where it's a matter of
subjective judgment?
'Subjective sport is always a difficult issue: diving, skating, even boxing
without a knockout is subjective. It certainly calls for skill to skate, it
calls for skill to dance on skates.
'Oliver Cutts, who was involved in ballroom dancing, used to ask me: 'Why
can't ballroom dancing be an Olympic sport?' I would waffle away and say
it's not really a sport. Then he would say: 'What about ice dancing? The
only difference is the skill required to stay on skates.''
Remembering the bad press suffered by the recent winter Olympics, I asked
Sir Arthur whether the winter games were degenerate.
'Degenerate is not a word I would accept. But I think there's a real
difference.' He described how limited was people's access to winter sports,
in spite of the appearance at Albertville of bobsleigh teams from the
Caribbean.
'Now take the 100 metres. Every child at the age of eight, if not sick or
infirm, has run a race even if only at a Sunday school. So sprinters are the
best of a nation. How do you relate a gold medal for the 100 metres with a
gold medal in the bobsleigh where number two and three run like mad for 30
yards, jump in, keep their heads down and pray for the next minute . . . and
win a gold medal?'
Ideally, then, Olympic sports should be universal. But Sir Arthur goes even
further.
'The very nub is not the competition itself but the Olympic village. For two
or three weeks the cream of the world's youth share, metaphorically at
least, one roof. They learn how much they have in common. They share the
hopes, the fears. The US competitors and the Soviet Union competitors find
their rivals don't have horns or tails.'
You have been called a conservative, I said. Are you part of a dwindling
minority at the top of the Olympic movement?
Sir Arthur protested. 'I don't consider myself conservative. I prefer
'traditionalist'. I don't subscribe to the idea that all change is
necessarily for the better.
'If you ask me whether sport is to be run for the benefit of the competitors
or the benefit of those who batten on to the competitors and make fortunes
as a result, I would say sport is for those who participate.'
Sir Arthur is gold dust for sports writers because he usually comes up with
the good quote. Especially on the subject of drugs.
'It is long-term, calculated cheating,' he said. 'Fundamentally, sport is
about health and honesty and drugs are the very negation of it.'
When he protested about athletes taking body-building drugs, at the 1968
Mexico Games, he was 'laughed out of court', he says.
Is your view prevailing?
'Well, I'm an optimist. Whenever I look up and see how far we have to go I
look back and see how far we've come. The first battle is always for the
hearts and minds of men. Now very few people if any are prepared to defend
drug abuse in public. Much of the drug abuse has been eradicated.
'Remember, our task is not to detect those who do cheat, but to protect the
majority who don't cheat. If in sport you are going to allow the cheats to
prosper - we all as kids learn that cheats never prosper  - when you see a
Ben Johnson (100m gold medallist in Seoul) offered Dollars 30,000 appearance
money as world record holder but Dollars 1m for an appearance as a convicted
cheat, there is a stench about it, something that stinks.'
He agreed that for drug abuse to continue undetected required the connivance
not only of coaches but of officialdom. He had been told by a top
pharmacologist that his worst enemies were chemists in his own university
who were trying to develop undetectable drugs. ('This was not in the UK, I
hasten to add]')
This week, Boris Becker, the former Wimbledon tennis champion, was reported
as saying he would not support Berlin's bid to host the Games in the year
2000. Having been abused by neo-Nazis for going out with a coloured woman,
he was afraid that success for Germany in those Games would excite the
racists once more.
Sir Arthur agreed that in recent years countries had tried to use the Games
as an advertisement for the superiority of their system - capitalist or
communist.
But not all nationalism was inflammatory. 'I think there is pride in the
performance of one's own countrymen. I don't look upon that as a bad aspect
of nationalism.
'In a sporting sense that can be negative. But if it's an alternative to
making war, it's positive. We live in a very imperfect world. We may all
seek perfection, but we're never going to achieve it. We're human, we're
fallible and if sport can minimise a few of those failings, it's better than
nothing, isn't it?
'There's this awful English phrase 'fair play'. But we know what it means
and I think it is the very nub of the Olympic Games.'

   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Luciano Pavarotti has banned strong-smelling flowers from his hotel suite
for fear of inflaming his tonsils before his concert at the Scottish
exhibition centre in Glasgow.' News item. I WASN'T surprised to read that
snippet, aware, as I am, that each day we breathe about 23,040 times and
inhale and exhale something like 438 cubic feet of air. As my good friend
Diane Ackerman has written, in A Natural History of the Senses:
'Etymologically speaking, a breath is not neutral or bland - it's cooked
air; we live in a constant simmering. There is a furnace in our cells, and
when we breathe we pass the world through our bodies, brew it lightly, and
turn it loose again, gently altered for having known us.'
Which is why a pasta-basher of Luciano's luminosity has to be extremely
careful of what he breathes - or, indeed, touches, tastes, hears and sees.
I think I read somewhere that if Pavarotti looks out of a hotel window and
sees something that displeases him - a Tesco superstore, or Lord King on a
motorbike, or a herd of brown cows, or Virginia Bottomley in her Wellingtons
picking pears up a ladder - then there isn't a hotel manager anywhere who is
not prepared, right there and then, to rush outside his hotel and smite into
oblivion, expunge from view, render invisible, the object or person that is
distressing Luciano.
Even if I didn't read it, or misconstrued what I read, I am sure it must be
true, given the awe and reverence in which Luciano is held.
Which set me thinking - if I had Pavarotti's power, which person or object
would I want expunged from view, rendered invisible, so that I could set
about my tasks, or enjoy a bit of lifestyle, free of distraction and
irritation?
A politician? Perhaps poor John Major, or poor Neil Kinnock? Droopy Chris
Patten? Doomed Norman Lamont? Chest-thumping Michael Heseltine? Lugubrious
John Smith? Pouty Diane Abbott? Virile Paddy Ashdown?
Not a bit of it. So far as politicians go, I am in upmode at present. I have
decided I like them. The realisation that I like politicians dawned on me
two weeks ago in my hotel suite in Los Angeles.
I had finished a day of meetings and was sitting on my sofa, looking at my
flowers - and wondering if there was anything in my suite, or outside the
window, down by the swimming pool, maybe in the parking lot, worth ringing
the manager about and demanding he remove. There was nothing. So I turned on
the TV and was able to see at once that George Bush was in trouble.
He was in trouble because the network anchorman, sitting in his studio, said
he was in trouble. The fact is that US anchormen, indeed most of the US
media, are so spectacularly thick that it has taken them four years to see
that George is in trouble, whereas someone like me, if there is, in fact,
anyone, could see years and years ago that George was in trouble.
But I like George a lot. He is droll and jokey and beautifully relaxed. In
any case, the real reason I am in upmode about politicians is that I have
realised, just lately, that they can only be blamed for a fraction of the
things for which they are blamed. Journalists like to blame politicians for
almost everything; to claim that the world is in such great trouble because
politics attracts the corrupt, the dim and the - invariably - untalented.
I now think this a fallacy. If it was easy to run democracies, there would
be textbooks and formulas telling us how to do it. But there aren't, because
it isn't. And it is getting harder all the time - more people, less money,
bigger and bigger problems. I do not believe that poverty can be eradicated.
Or that people will stop hitting one another. Or wars suddenly cease. Not
for 10,000 years.
At some point in the future perhaps all of us will be happy and live in
clean cities without fear of mugging or bombs in stations or muck in the
water or having to wonder why Britain needs a submarine fleet, let alone a
nuclear one. But not right now we won't; which is why I am feeling kindly
towards politicians.
So who would I banish from view if I was as powerful as Pavarotti? The
answer - you've guessed it  - is that well-known novelist, composer,
script-writer, critic, lexicologist, lecturer in speech and drama, education
specialist, historian, geographer, rocket scientist, astronomer, wit,
pundit, commentator, Olympic silver medallist, multiple world record holder,
architect, town planner, gourmand, gourmet, vintner's assistant, raconteur,
after-dinner speaker, Magic Circle president, patron saint of club-class and
certain Nobel prizewinner - yes, the utterly unavoidable and omniscient
Anthony Burgess.
I wish he would shut up. He is getting on my tonsils.

FT  07 MAR 92 / An old dream feels its age: Ian Botham's triumphs have made
Dominic Lawson ask if 35 really is ancient
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE EVERY other schoolboy I used to daydream about playing cricket for
England. I would write down batting line-ups in which the very unresonant
name of Lawson would magically appear alongside those of Dexter, Cowdrey and
the up and coming youngster from Yorkshire, Geoffrey Boycott.
Naturally, my pull shot was more pulverising than Dexter's, my cover drive
more elegant than Cowdrey's, and my forward defensive more impenetrable than
Boycott's.
Such fantasies worked because it was theoretically possible that they might
come true. Who knew what the future and adulthood held? Admittedly, as the
years passed by this theoretical possibility became increasingly . . .
theoretical. But now I am faced with the depressing truth: at 35, it is all
too late. It is possible to fantasise about what one might do in the future,
but to fantasise about what one might have done in the past - this just does
not work.
I had never before thought that 35 was old, but the cricketing event of the
past week - the achievement of Ian Botham in England's victory over
Australia - has made me realise how wrong I was. Botham, barely a few months
older than I am, is, according to various and different press commentators
'old', 'an aldermanic uncle' and 'a miracle of sporting longevity.'
Even worse have been the comments of the commentators on Sky Television who
squawk incredulously that 'the old boy has done it again' and 'it's an
amazing achievement for a man of his age.' Graham Gooch who is, at 38, even
more ancient than either me or Ian Botham, was also cited by one commentator
as 'a remarkable triumph of mind over matter: 'is knees 'ave almost gone.'
I suppose that the achievements of Messrs Botham and Gooch should have made
me feel as though my fantasy of playing for England was not yet dead, but
somehow the incredulity of the commentators at these supposed triumphs of
gerontocracy have had the opposite effect.
What is particularly unbearable is that these comments come from retired
Test cricketers of enormous age - the sort of people who had their first
experience of a creaking knee before Ian Botham could grow hair on his upper
lip.
I am not sure what the motives of these pundits are. Is it jealousy of the
success of cricketers who have carried on playing international matches at
an age when the commentators had already turned into shambling, pot-bellied
wrecks?
Is it because Sky Sport - the television channel with exclusive rights to
the cricket World Cup - believes that the bulk of its audience is so young
as to regard anyone of 35 as a venerable father figure?
Perhaps it is just a journalistic desire to manufacture a story of triumph
against adversity: how much more enthralling it is to believe that we are
witnessing something miraculous, when in fact Botham and Gooch are far
outshone, as examples of cricketing longevity, by the likes of Sir Jack
Hobbs, Colin Cowdrey and Gubby Allen.
I can envisage the next step to be taken by Sky Sport and the new school of
cricket impresarios. They will create a veterans' tournament open to players
over 30, exclusive coverage of which will fill the few hours not already
occupied by veterans' tennis and veterans' golf.
In these tournaments a boundary will be greeted with a howl of disbelief,
while any 40-year-old bowler who manages to knock a stump out of the ground
will be hailed as a marvel of modern health care techniques. His diet will
be serialised, along with his exercise regime, in the better Sunday colour
supplements. In the less good ones his wife will give interviews about how
she keeps her man young.
The effect of moving all the 30-something crocks into the veterans' league
will, of course, be to allow the ageing commentators to opine that a certain
Test cricketer in his late 20s is 'past his best' or to marvel that another
is 'still able to turn his arm over at the age of 29.'
Meanwhile, my own daydream has changed: I shall now fantasise about being a
cricket commentator. That seems to be a profession without redundancy or
obsolescence.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Heaven and Hell: Passion, argument and perpetual change -
Marx and the true meaning of a socialist idyll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARXISM'S most alluring innovation has become its most glaring weakness. It
offered to deliver Heaven on earth; to create a world of harmony from a
world of conflict and imperfections; to realise in real, material life the
aspirations that previously were invested in some offshore spiritual world.
All of society, not just well-behaved individuals, could make it into the
socialist Heaven.
The drawback became obvious. The main attraction of this Heaven was that it
could be made on this earth. That meant progress towards it could be
measured much more accurately than an individual's inner, moral progress
towards the spiritual Heaven offered by religion.
This religious Heaven is always around the next corner. The socialist Heaven
is meant to arrive in the measurable here and now. The masses of eastern
Europe have seen the evidence and they have given up waiting.
Yet, the drawback to the traditional socialist vision of Heaven is not just
that it takes an awfully long time and great human sacrifice to create. The
idea is flawed fatally.
Central to the socialist Heaven is the abolition of choice. There will be
abundance because socialism will have unleashed the creative and productive
potential which was kept locked-up by the inequities of capitalism.
Abundance will allow people to have what they want, without foregoing
anything else. They will not have to choose between mutually exclusive
alternatives.
As a result there is no conflict. Abundance allows all preferences to be
reconciled. Altruism becomes possible because people no longer feel
threatened by the fear that, unless they hold on to what they have got,
someone will take it away from them. There is no need for a state to impose
laws because the citizens of socialist Heaven have no incentive to break any
law, or infringe anyone else's rights. Everyone gets along with everyone
else.
People become transformed. Where once they were cynical, grasping, selfish,
vain, cruel and ignorant, they will become noble, kind, gentle, altruistic,
considerate and educated. They live in a pastoral world, rather like a Lake
District valley, where all the material riches of industrialisation co-exist
miraculously with the clean air and sparkling streams of a land in which men
and women can roam free to commune with their creative spirits.
The flaws in this vision are only partly that socialist economic planning
has delivered shortages and pollution rather than environmentally friendly
abundance. The first problem is the idea of abundance itself.
This socialist idyll is just one version of a productivist visions of Heaven
thrown-up by industrialisation - visions of a society of untrammelled wealth
created by unleashing the huge productive power of modern technology to
exploit natural resources and manufacture them into usable products. This
ideal of unending abundance meeting ever expanding human appetites is no
longer tenable.
A modern version of Heaven will have to be informed environmentally. It will
be based upon people living in balance with nature by restraining their
appetites, in deference to the demands of the environment. The old socialist
vision of Heaven was based upon man conquering nature. New progressive
visions will have to be based upon a more responsible and accommodating
approach to man's place within nature.
That does not mean a modern Heaven would revert to medieval craft
production. The old socialist vision was of a Heaven full of manufactured
products, physical, tangible, material things made of steel and glass. New
progressive visions will be influenced by the growth of micro-electronics,
which is re-drawing the line between the material and the non-material world
more effectively than either religion or Marxism.
Soon, we will be able to pass from the ordinary, hum-drum world and step
into a non-physical world of flickering electronic images. Already, many
children spend much of their days glued to computer games and videos while
their parents sit at computer screens in their offices. Future machines will
transport us into worlds - Wild West towns, forests, swimming under the sea
 -which appear to be real but actually are generated electronically.
For the generation of children which is just starting school, Heaven might
be a room full of Nintendo games, walls of screens, banks of computer
terminals and karaoke machines. Forget the pastoral idyll of the Lake
District: give them neon lights, a cacophony of sound and a stream of
loosely-connected images.
The socialist view of Heavenly society is flawed more fundamentally. It
would not merely be technically and morally difficult to create a society of
abundance and altruism. There is a deeper problem: it would not be a society
at all.
The old vision of Heaven is a society at rest. After a long march, the
collective reaches a point where conflict and argument fade away. It finally
can settle down. It has found truth and moral certitude. This harmonious,
Heavenly society has overcome all the tensions that bedevil everyday earthly
societies.
The trouble is that these tensions are not an unwelcome by-product of
society - they are at its very heart. They are produced by the diversity of
values and differences of view among individuals which give society its
energy. Diversity and difference, tension and argument are the lifeblood of
society, not an unwanted social pollutant.
The best societies are dynamic because they are rich in diversity and
innovation. They are open and pluralistic and they encourage experimentation
and imagination.
For too long, we have laboured with an ideal that the zenith of human
activity is to be in a state of complete rest. This appeals deeply but is
quite wrong. For me, Heaven is a society which is as active and fluid as
possible. Heaven is a world of great passion, multi-lingual argument,
expanding knowledge, momentous discoveries, perpetual change and unending
motion.
The drawback is that it would be utterly exhausting.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Arts: A low-key labour of love shot from the hip - Screen /
Nigel Andrews talks to director Paul Schrader about his latest film
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO ANYONE who still remembers the Big Band sound there is only one
significant telephone number in New York. It is 'Pennsylvania 6-5-Oh-Oh-Oh'
and it belongs to the Penta Hotel, formerly the Statler Hilton. In this maze
of decayed inter-war glamour, where Glenn Miller's ghostly trumpets threaten
to purl forth in the lifts or lobby, film-maker Paul Schrader was recently
at work shooting his new film Light Sleeper. The man who created Taxi
Driver, American Gigolo and The Comfort Of Strangers had taken a sabbatical
from Hollywood to go native in New York, making a small-budget film with two
bright, idiosyncratic stars in Willem Dafoe (Platoon, The Last Temptation Of
Christ) and Susan Sarandon (Oscar-nominated for Thelma And Louise).
The hotel's faded glory tempts one as a metaphor for a stylish director now
going shoestring. But Schrader, when I visited the set, insisted he was
making the movie out of love and not because Hollywood has not offered him,
say, Evita. Fifty this year, he has sketched the story of a man in a
mid-life crisis: a drug courier (Dafoe) whose lady boss (Sarandon) has
decided to swap cocaine for cosmetics and go straight. Out of a job and out
on the street, Dafoe finds life further unsettled by police curiosity about
a girl drug addict's death.
'It's a film of the stripe of Taxi Driver,' says Schrader. 'It's about a guy
who 'drifts' from place to place and sees certain dangerous things and
events gradually conspire. He's 40 and he doesn't know what to do with his
life. He hasn't managed to do much at all up to this point.'
The story may not be directly autobiographical, but there are clearly
personal resonances. 'Take this guy in his twenties, he was very hostile and
paranoid.' (Like the hero of Taxi Driver). 'In his thirties he was very
narcissistic.' (Like the hero of American Gigolo). 'Now he's 40 and he's
very anxious. So the arc of character reflects the different feelings we
have as we get older.'
Schrader himself wrote the script, cast the movie and moved mountains to get
it financed. 'Again it's like Taxi Driver. That was a small personal film,
just Dollars 2m, which Marty Scorsese and Robert De Niro and I all felt
passionate about and made sacrifices to make. The only reason Light Sleeper
is low-budget is that nobody's getting paid. Most of us are on deferment.'
Even so, a Hollywood studio has to be persuaded to pitch in at some point.
How do you sell a low-key, idiomatic film in the age of Terminator 2? 'You
appeal to their (the studios') best interests financially] At one point on
this film I was Dollars 300,000 into it and still didn't have a bank loan.
But I was making it an attractive package. I'd pulled in good actors and got
them to defer their salaries and I'd set up the crew. It's basically the
Coppola Theory. If you go on saying you're making a movie long enough,
someone will believe you and give you the money]'
Schrader takes a break to shoot Susan Sarandon in a fetching red suit
running down a hotel corridor screaming 'Fire]' She does this six times for
the camera. After the last take the exhausted actress runs straight into an
FT microphone. 'This is the first film I've made since Thelma And Louise and
yes, it's about as far from Hollywood as you could get. (Puff pant). But I
prefer locations; there's more excitement. People are scrambling, they help
each other with their jobs, there's less demarcation. (Puff). Los Angeles
always feels like a 9 to 5 job. On location everyone surrenders to the
project.'
Willem Dafoe is less breathless even though he is about to film - is already
rehearsing - a climactic shoot-out. He came to Light Sleeper because he
liked Schrader's direct approach to making and setting up films. 'The story
just came straight out of him, he wrote it very fast and I love the idea of
shooting a film 'from the hip'. There's something very true about this
story's sense of time and place, it's not Hollywood-concocted.'
Back in Paul Schrader's 'trailer', the director is recuperating from the
first week's shooting. Since I'm the first foreign press-person to visit the
set, he has not yet polished his PR act. 'I haven't yet been asked what this
film is about,' he tells me disarmingly, 'so I haven't worked out an
answer.'
Schrader is more certain of what he and his cinema as a whole are about. 'I
suppose the directors who've influenced me would be Scorsese, Bertolucci,
Antonioni. But there are different role models one has as a film-maker and
for me the best is someone like Stanley Kubrick, who tries to 'reinvent the
wheel.' I don't have those ambitions, but I like to keep doing something
fresh, something people haven't seen in that light before. So my personal
model would be Kubrick rather than Hitchcock or Ford, people who keep mining
the same territory.
'But, you know, we're all Hollywood directors really. Even when we're
working on location in New York. Right now the people who used to be at the
top commercially like Disney are having a rough time. And a film-maker like
Spike Lee comes along and suddenly he's in style. For years everyone knew
that there was a 'black' market to be tapped and no one had either the
brains or the guts, or the astuteness, to get into it. Well, Spike got into
it his own way and on his own terms. Now he's brought up behind him a
half-dozen young directors and you have a fully-fleshed, very vibrant wing
of American film-making.
'So when you say 'Hollywood' that's an oddball term. To me Hollywood means
the American motion picture industry. And that means not just Sidney Pollack
and Steven Spielberg, it means David Lynch or Spike Lee. The same people,
the major studios, finance both. George Lucas of Star Wars said to me when
he heard I was going to make a low-budget film in New York, 'You're not
really a Hollywood director.' And I said, 'George, we're all Hollywood
directors. We're just different kinds]'
But how many older members of that breed - back to my earlier question  -
would be as ready as Schrader to trade the well-upholstered comforts of West
Coast filming for a tiny film noir on the East Coast?
At this Schrader gives me his most passionately argued answer of the day. I
get a free reprimand plus a free lecture on a movie style. ''Film noir' is
the most bandied phrase in cinema today. There is no such thing as modern
film noir. It's a historical period not a genre. Genres are things like
Westerns, gangster pictures, science fiction. Historical periods are things
like German Expressionism, Nouvelle Vague, film noir.
'Film noir came up after the war through a convergence of several
influences. The expatriate, Germanic influences in Hollywood; the sense of
let-down that many Americans felt after the war, when guys came home and
couldn't get work and their wives were more independent because they'd had
jobs, and many marriages broke up.
'It was a kind of dead-end backlash and it crept into cinema after the war.
And of course it was already percolating in hardboiled fiction. It was very
vibrant through the early 1950s, then it gradually died out with the new
affluence and the rise of television and colour photography. So yes, film
noir was an important chapter in American cinema. But you can't repeat it.
If we're making movies about anxiety or loneliness or personal crisis today,
they're our own movies. They're not films noirs, they're a group that may be
just as unified but different. Perhaps years hence someone will come up with
a new phrase to describe them.'
Suggestions, please. Meanwhile Light Sleeper opens in Britain on March 13.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Arts: Winning portraits - The John Player National Portrait
Gallery award
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PORTRAIT Award came into being in 1980, when Imperial Tobacco and the
National Portrait Gallery came together with a view to doing something to
stimulate the practice of portrait painting, thought at that time to be in
some decline, and to encourage young artists.
So it was that an open competition for artists aged 40 years and under was
proposed and agreed, with the winner to be commissioned to paint the
portrait of a distinguished sitter, which the company undertook to present
and the gallery to accept.
Some 12 years on, we can see that it was this last consideration that was
the masterstroke. The John Player Portrait Award established itself
immediately and prominently in the annual fixture list, regularly attracting
a large initial entry and a strong and varied final exhibition. Clearly
young artists were active and positive in their response, if only to the
prospect of winning a sizeable sum of money.
There had been in fact no actual decline in the art of the portrait, but it
was true that while the interest in the figure and figurative subjects in
general was flourishing, there was some inhibition about the portrait qua
portrait, as though it were a specialised and exclusive mystery. Not least
of the Portrait Award's achievements has been the bringing back of the
portrait itself into the normal run of the figurative painter's
preoccupations, a problem or interest to be addressed like any other.
John Player rounded off its sponsorship in 1989 with the tenth running of
the Award, passing it on to British Petroleum under which it continues to
prosper. But portrait commissions take time to accomplish, and the last of
those that followed upon the 1989 competition, when two artists shared the
prize, has only lately been completed and accepted into the collection. This
last unveiling, of Tai-Shan Schierenberg's large portrait of the barrister
and writer, John Mortimer, concentrated a few minds; the result is an
exhibition of the commissions of the full ten years of John Player's
involvement arranged to coincide with the acceptance of the new portrait
(National Portrait Gallery, St Martin's Place WC2, until March 15). The
useful catalogue summarises the competition year by year.
With those last joint-winners, there were 11 winners in all, five of them
women. It is remarkable how young so many of them were, one or two even
still at art school. Two, admittedly, were in the last year of their
eligibility, yet even so the average age was 28. Any survey of 11 is narrow
enough, yet my own feeling is that it reflects the broader truth of the
matter. The students and young artists in the submission were ever evident
in strength, and it is no surprise at all that they should have come
through.
The prize was encouragement and the prospect of winning not too remote, for
it soon became clear there was in the judging no hint of favouritism or
'buggin's turn'.
But while such cash would seem a wonderful windfall, the full implications
of the consequent commission might take a little longer to sink in. For here
was the artist put very much on his mettle, with a distinguished personage
to be confronted in the certain knowledge that the result would be come to
rest in a permanent national collection. The challenge is one no true artist
would refuse, but it is daunting and can inhibit.
Not all the commissioned portraits are thus as fresh, perhaps, or as bold
and striking, as the portraits that actually won the prize. Not a single
artist has baulked at the undertaking, cut and run: all the works are
thorough-going, honourable and effective - the National Portrait Collection,
after all, was never one of masterpieces but of images of the great and
good. Yet one does feel at times that a second run at it might have done the
trick, or an essay on a smaller scale - the modern conventional acre of
canvas holds true for the portrait as for painting of any other kind.
That said, it is all the more gratifying to find this very last of the John
Player commissions as strong and brave a work as any of them. Tai-Shan
Schierenberg has indeed taken a large canvas and a bold, ambitious
composition, with John Mortimer seated to the front before him, in the
corner of the studio, and his own image, a presence looming and imprecise,
in the large mirror that tilts off the wall behind the sitter's chair - a
respectful nod towards Velasquez.
The handling is openly expressionist, free and confident, even casual in
certain passages, yet every element in the working and composition draws the
eye to the subject's head and face, that comes clearly into focus in an
admirable likeness. It is a great success.

UNDER the label 'Sony Broadway', Sony have compiled a new CD series which
will provide aficionados of the postwar Broadway musical with hours of
happiness. In their role as current proprietors of the CBS archives, the
company have put together an enticing mid-price reissue - around Pounds 7
per compact disc - of eight former CBS titles: Bernstein's Candide (1956)
and Wonderful Town (1958), Irving Berlin's Miss Liberty (1949), Frank
Loesser's The Most Happy Fella (1956), the Jules Styne-Leo Robin Gentlemen
Prefer Blondes (1949, with Carol Channing), A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1951),
Irma la Douce (1960), and On the Twentieth Century (1978).
Most of these are in their Original Broadway Cast guise (the Wonderful Town
is a 1958 made-for-television version notably inferior to the dazzling
original, first issued in this country on Decca). Not all the shows are
'classics', but all are worth hearing. The treasure of the collection, in
terms of both work and performance, is undoubtedly Candide; the record, one
of the most pleasurable ever made, raises the whole question of style in the
execution of musicals, the more so because it returns to CD existence
alongside last year's blockbuster DG set of the same work.
This, with its all-star cast, mighty-sized LSO and chorus and the composer
himself as conductor, was based on those Christmas 1989 Barbican concert
performances of unhappy memory, and came out not long after Bernstein's
death; for all sorts of obvious reasons it tended to serve, and to be
treated, as the Bernstein memorial on records. In my opinion it is a horror
almost from start to finish, a monstrous ballooning-out of a work whose
abiding fascination lies as much in its operetta-inherited intimacy as in
its richness, wit and subtlety of musical and dramatic subject matter.
Last year would not have provided the most tactful moment to say so; now,
with the dust on the grave of the much-loved and lamented Lenny settled, and
with the Broadway original freshly to hand, I feel emboldened to speak out.
Where the 1956 principals operate an exact focus, an unforced delicacy of
touch on the material itself, using the lines to 'make the case' - listen to
the splendid Barbara Cook caressing the words of 'Glitter and be gay', and
the great Max Adrian drily snapping out those of 'The Venice Gavotte'] -
Bernstein and his mighty cohorts attempt something much more grandiose: a
once-and-for-all setting of the seal on Candide as a deathless masterpiece.
That they fail so comprehensively in this achievement can, I think, be
ascribed to two main causes. The first is that the problems of Candide - a
failure in 1956 that was ceaselessly re-jigged and tinkered thereafter, and
that now exists in a veritable patchwork quilt of different versions,
authentic and otherwise - are inherent in its 'book' (over which Bernstein
and its author, Lillian Hellman, joined so fiercely in battle), and are not
solved by plumping the work out, as DG have done, with rediscovered numbers.
In this work, with its episodic format and one damn thing after another
plot-line, shorter is surely better.
The second, and far the more important, is that the further the performance
style moves from the re-creation of theatrical conditions toward what one
might call concert-hall spectacular, the more Bernstein's wonderfully
knowing musical mixture of light and serious, bittersweet and schmaltzy,
suffers.
At the Barbican, orchestra and chorus were enlarged to the point where
miking of the soloists became necessary - and thus a grotesque barrier was
therefore set up against the process of singer-and-audience communication.
Records, of course, avoid the difficulty, but nevertheless the mammoth
weight of forces exacts a heavy toll on forward movement; and Bernstein's
slow tempos are so often deadening to the spirit of the number in question.
Candide under his baton is an Event, not an entertainment; why, late in
life, he so badly needed and wanted to practise this perversion on his own
work is a question I hope future Bernstein biographers will try to answer.
'Make our garden grow', for instance, is blasted out with killing
ponderousness as a poor relation of Mahler's 'Resurrection' finale. Most of
the performers take their stylistic lead from the conductor. June Anderson
may be an infinitely more polished coloratura canary than Barbara Cook, but
she utterly lacks charm. Adolph Green's Pangloss and Nicolai Gedda's
Governor and Vanderdendur are word-singing and -speaking disasters.
Bernstein: Candide. 1) Robert Rounseville, Barbara Cook, Max Adrian, Irra
Petina, William Olvis etc./ Samuel Krachmalnick. Sony Broadway SK 48017 (one
CD)
2) Jerry Hadley, June Anderson, Adolph Green, Christa Ludwig, Nicolai Gedda

Richard Van Allan, Stuart Kale etc./ National SO/John Owen Edwards. That's
Entertainment Records Classics CDTER 1184 (one CD)
The big names in the cast remain, indeed, just that - names, not characters.
The exceptions are Christa Ludwig, witty and warm-spirited as the Old Lady,
and Jerry Hadley, who brings a McCormack-like sweetness and freshness of
personality, a genuine candour to Candide. For them, and for Andrew Porter's
elucidation of the work's complicated life-history in a masterly programme
note, I shall maintain the DG's place on the library shelf. But it is the
original Candide, now on Sony Broadway, that I shall continue to play for
pleasure.
The month in which Street Scene, Kurt Weill's self-styled 'Broadway opera',
makes a triumphant return to the Coliseum is a good one to touch on the two
Street Scene recordings issued last year. It is an irony that, after waiting
four decades for a first complete recording, lovers of the work should then
find themselves debating the merits of two; and a curiosity that both should
have the same British staging as their source. The Decca is the Scottish
Opera production of 1989, with an admixture of (mostly American) big names
in leading roles, the TER is the same production in its pure ENO form.
Meriel Dickinson's mesmerising account of the implacable tenement watchdog
Mrs Jones is common to both.
Unlike in the DG Candide, the relationship of stage to recording remains
organic and healthy in both performances. Choice is hard: both possess great
strengths and minor weaknesses (British opera-singers valiantly
counterfeiting the accents of native and immigrant New Yorkers will trouble
some listeners more than others), and both capture the special greatness of
the work. My preference, finally, is for the Decca, since its stars - Ramey,
Barstow and Hadley above all  - sink themselves into their roles with a
compelling combination of dramatic power and directness of expression; and
because John Mauceri is so much more theatrical a Street Scene conductor
than TER's Carl Davis. But it's by no means unarguable.
Miss Barstow, for so many years neglected by the record companies, has also
blossomed as an EMI and TER operetta and musical-comedy leading lady. It is
an unlikely but by no means an unwelcome development; she has, after all,
the needed theatrical panache in vast quantities, and in the EMI Kiss Me,
Kate (to which she came as an 11th-hour replacement for Teresa Stratas) her
superb musicality and wonderfully individual palette of tone-colours exert a
sultry, seductive pull on the phrases of 'So in love'. She does not sound
like an opera-diva on a slumming excursion. Neither, mutatis mutandis, does
Thomas Hampson as her leading man; and though the work itself comes across
as less snappy, smart and sophisticated than remembered, the conductor, John
McGlinn, catches the Cole Porter style without inflation.
But the really extraordinary Barstow feat is to transform herself, via a
fearsome shadow-of-Bow-Bells accent and a rip-roaring snarl in the chest
register, into the Nancy of Lionel Bart's Oliver]. The recording is based on
the recent National Youth Music Theatre production, with singer-actors and
actor-singers excellently mixed and matched. There is an overdose of sugar
in the arrangements, by the conductor John Owen Edwards; otherwise, even the
most fanatical devotees of Ron Moody, Georgia Brown and the rest of the
much-loved 1960 cast originals can be encouraged to investigate the new TER
set.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Arts: Truly festive wonder - Poetry in performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCORDING TO Simon Armitage, the young poet from Huddersfield who was the
opening reader at last week's St Andrews Poetry Festival, it is the smell of
the cabbage that they remember best, those ex-prisoners from Strangeways.
And the brutal, hammering rhythms of 'D821 Remembers Strangeways', a grim
litany of defiance, hopelessness and sheer verbal aggression in which 'and
the smell of the cabbage' was repeated over and over again until the
audience began to loathe the stuff brought out Armitage's best qualities as
poet and performer. He hammers away at our genteel presuppositions about the
nature and purpose of poetry like a street lout with a lump hammer inside
his jacket.
After swallowing hard on all that northern grit, it came as something of a
surprise to rediscover that poetry needn't after all be abrasively
social-realist if it is to be honest. The Scots poet John Dixon, a tall,
cravated, cherubic-cheeked lawyer by profession, let his sequence of new
poems speak for themselves - other than to remind us that poetry was
essentially a spiritual thing 'like love, music and, of course, God
himself'. We were then treated to a stream of beautifully articulated,
hastily read pseudo-narratives of metaphysical bewilderment, somewhat in the
Ashbery mode. Occasionally, the voice would rise to a higher, more dreamy,
register, transubstantiating the poem into wispy, smoke-like things. 'It's
that line of light on the horizon,' he explained before reading his last
poem, 'That Point where the Sun meets the Sky - as on the West Coast of
Scotland. That's what poetry always looks for.'
Younger poets like Armitage and Dixon come to poetry festivals bearing
sheafs of paper and what they read is new, aggressively new. The future is
racing ahead of them. The older ones clutch well-rubbed, well-annotated
copies of published books to their chests as a clergyman might clutch his
bible, and for much the same reason: it is armour against the world; the
real, tangible proof that one has laboured to some end. They count
themselves lucky to be writing six poems a year. Life and creativity are
slipping away.
Which is why, on the second evening of the festival, I was shocked to see
the poet Hugo Williams, a tall, fairly handsome man in his forties, slipping
sideways into the St Leonards School Music Room with a blue Simplex folder.
Until, that is, he began to shake those dog-eared copies out . . .
Himself the son of an actor, Williams reads his poems in a rather languid
fashion as if it were the Rotherham Playhouse tonight and he was mindful of
the need to save himself for Saturday night's big push at the Bradford
Alhambra. He is quite obsessed by the minutiae of his own autobiography - to
such a degree that we see the schoolboy petulance, the boyish anxieties
written in his face as he reads, with a slight stammer, poems about the
difficulties (and the exhilarations) of living with an imperious,
peripatetic actor-playwright father. Many of the poems he read were little
versified letters that dealt with the petty, stinging humiliations of
adolescence. No matter how tall one grows, one is still apt to be caught
with one's trousers down.
The festival concluded with a reading by two established voices from
England, Craig Raine, sometime chief of the Martians, and James Fenton, poet
and foreign correspondent extraordinary. Raine, looking mildly piratical in
a flamboyant red shirt, and densely bearded as ever, was in a ponderous,
meticulous mood, picking his way through poems clotted with metaphor upon
brilliant, tricksy metaphor. Every word had the high polish of a conker.
And as Raine read, Fenton sat, slumped forward in his chair, looking heavy
and lugubrious, his large, bald, egg-shaped head held quite fiercely between
his hands like Humpty Dumpty contemplating the disaster of himself. Who
would have guessed that when he stood up to read he would actually make the
audience laugh with a marvellous selection of rollicking ballads, all stuff
and meaningful nonsense, like some latter-day knees-slapping Edward Lear?
It was a moment of truly festive wonder.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Arts: Dresden tunes up - After 40 years of communism the
musical tempo in this great city is gaining pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRESDEN WAS not rebuilt in a day. Since the fall of Communism, work on
restoring the city's shattered monuments has speeded up. The stump of the
Frauenkirche is now adorned with scaffolding and the eerie ruin of the
Taschenberg Palais is to be developed as a luxury hotel. But it will be ten
or 20 years before the spectre of devastation left by that one night of
bombing in February 1945 can be removed.
It will also be some time before Dresden resumes its profile as one of
Europe's great musical cities. This is where Weber and Wagner served as
Hofkapellmeister, where nine Richard Strauss operas were premiered, where
Schuch, Busch and Bohm developed and maintained a strong Germanic tradition.
Then, during 40 years of communism, Dresden was gradually reduced to a cheap
recording outpost.
The tempo of musical life is now picking up. After a sharp drop in
attendance figures before and after unification, the Dresdeners' appetite
for music has returned. The Staatskapelle, Dresden's renowned opera
orchestra, is once again attracting the world's leading conductors. Along
with most other major east German institutions, the Dresden Philharmonic
(the city's main concert orchestra) and the Semper Opera have brought in new
administrators from the west, with their own ideas about artistic
programming and marketing. Established German singers like Rene Kollo have
given performances for no fee.
But the hangover from unification is proving hard to shrug off. Orchestra
salaries in Dresden are still only 60 per cent of those in Hamburg or
Stuttgart. The task of slimming down communist-era staffing levels has yet
to be confronted. The Dresden Philharmonic is in the throes of an artistic
leadership crisis, and the acoustical barrenness of its ugly 2,400-seat
home, the Kulturpalast, is affecting morale and standards. A promised new
hall will not be ready until 1997.
The orchestra is also caught up in what has been dubbed 'Stasi-gier', the
obsession with exposing former state security informers. Only four of its
players were Communist Party members, but the extent of Stasi infiltration
has yet to be established. It is a bitter issue.
The atmosphere at the Semper Opera is more positive, partly because the
building itself - faithfully reconstructed by the communists and re-opened
in 1985 - is well-equipped and has become a major tourist draw. The
orchestra and chorus are among Europe's best. But the company wants to be
able to compete with cities like Munich in the international market for
conductors and soloists, and to do that it needs more money. Next year, the
federal government in Bonn - which has provided emergency grants since
unification - will hand back the burden of funding to the Saxon state
government, jeopardising the contracts which the new intendant, Christoph
Albrecht, has signed with guest-artists.
For the time being, Albrecht is trading on the fact that many singers are
happy to perform in Dresden simply to share in its traditions: at the start
of next season, for example, Felicity Lott will sing the title role in a new
production of Arabella, one of the Strauss operas most closely associated
with the city.
But Dresden's music institutions could be in for a nasty shock if the local
economy does not pick up quickly. Already the city is discovering that
artistic leadership does not come cheap: after a long and apparently
successful courtship of Giuseppe Sinopoli for the post of music director at
the Semper Opera, the Saxon state government last month found the Italian
conductor had suddenly increased his financial demands to match the DM
900,000 contract recently awarded to Daniel Barenboim at the Berlin State
Opera. Sinopoli has also made his involvement in individual productions
conditional on the engagement of certain singers, most of whom are expensive
recording stars.
One of Sinopoli's attractions is his own Deutsche Grammophon contract, which
has already benefitted the Staatskapelle. On the other hand, as long as he
continues to dominate the orchestra's concert work, the opera house will be
unable to attract an alternative music director of sufficient standing. The
whole Sinopoli episode suggests that Dresden has not yet found a way to
reconcile its glorious pre-war tradition with its current straitened
circumstances.
The Semper Opera has four new productions this season. Lulu, which was new
to Dresden, found favour neither with the conservative local public nor with
the tourists whom the city is so keen to attract. La Cenerentola, Dresden's
contribution to the Rossini year, was a popular success and marked the
company's conversion to original-language performance with surtitles. Still
to come are Les Contes d'Hoffmann, to be staged next week by the radical
east German producer Peter Konwitschny, and Der Freischutz during the
Dresden Festival in May. The rest of the season is taken up with standard
repertory, played six nights a week at prices (DM10 to 50) only marginally
below those in equivalent west German houses.
One of the joys of any visit to the Semper Opera is the theatre itself.
Built as a court opera house in 1841 and occupying a commanding position in
Dresden's historic centre, it has a spacious, richly decorated horse-shoe
auditorium and an atmosphere of tradition. The acoustic is disappointing:
the orchestral sound is rich and well-blended, but the voices simply do not
project over the footlights - perhaps the penalty for enlarging the
proscenium during reconstruction.
Both Lulu and Cenerentola can be judged artistic successes, the Rossini
particularly so. Martin Rupprecht's designs - a tumble-down under-the-arches
homestead for the opening and closing scenes, a revolving gold prism for the
palace - had a post-modern look, set against a bright blue background.
Steffen Piontek's stage direction was equally pleasing: fluent ensemble
work, witty without being over-produced. Alidoro, sung by Eike Wilm Schulte
with the vocal poise of a Lieder specialist and the dramatic presence of a
practised Wagnerian, was a magical master of ceremonies, engineering the
prince's arrival in a balloon-basket and setting off an elegant firework
display at the end.
Kathleen Kuhlmann's Angelina was vocally polished but rather pallid, lacking
the youthful vulnerability to stir the heart. Eduardo Gimenez was the
eloquent Don Ramiro, Martin Gantner a handsome Dandini. Don Magnifico was
sung by Rolf Wollrad, an experienced basso buffo who served with dignity as
'father of the house' in the months after unification. The performance was
very respectably conducted by the young Englishman Anthony Bramall - a
replacement for Arnold Ostman, who had a bust-up with the Staatskapelle at
the first rehearsal.
The conductor of Lulu was Friedemann Layer, who displayed admirable
structural command, steering a course between dry intellectualism and
sensuous lyricism. The Staatskapelle played with outstanding tonal bloom, as
if the music was in their blood. The staging by Fred Berndt, an east German
drama producer and designer, updated the setting to the 1930s, but otherwise
showed too much respect for Berg's stage instructions, too little fantasy.
The entire evening took place within a circus ring, with a caged perimeter
in the prologue and a trap-door and tent for the finale. Apart from the Act
Two film interlude - a whirl of shocked female faces - the story was told
with pristine clarity. But Lulu is more than a domestic morality play. There
was no sense of Lulu's ascent and descent, nothing sordid, no tragic
grandeur.
The cast was dominated by Siegfried Vogel's Athlete - physically vulgar,
larger-than-life, powerfully declaimed. Theo Adam's Dr Schon has seen better
days, but he still cuts a commanding figure on stage. Kerstin Witt's
Geschwitz and Norbert Orth's Alwa made no great impression. In the title
role, Maria Husmann looked chic and sexy, and caught a selfish, callous
streak in the character, but the voice lacked weight or brilliance. This
Lulu was just too innocent by half.

LBC is the only independent radio station in England to give drama, though
in Glasgow Radio Clyde does, and in Belfast Downtown Radio. LBC presents its
plays in nightly five-minute sections, no direct challenge to the BBC. What
challenge there is between the script units is modified by the Woolwich
Young Playwrights Competition, whose winners (not all that young) come out
on LBC.
Currently we are hearing Neville Watchurst's All in the Same Boat. This is a
satire about the Gulf war. Johnno, the son of Sir Tobias Johnson, Foreign
Secretary and armament maker, enlists his tank crew into the New Age Group.
They kidnap a handy conference of world leaders and condemn them to 10 years
in a cruise-liner. But Johnno won't abandon his father, and frees him - a
mistake, for Sir Tobias takes over the New Age Group, sinks the liner and
announces himself as dictator. I meant to be generous, but comedy won't work
unless you believe what you hear, and this was all so unconvincing that I
couldn't even decide which side I was supposed to be on. You can hear the
final instalment on Tuesday.
By contrast, the Chekhov-and-after festival on BBC Radio 3 (FM only from now
on), continued on Sunday with a repeat of John Tydeman's 1974 production of
The Cherry Orchard, containing a stunning performance of Ranyevskaya by Gwen
Ffrangcon-Davies - then 82, but sounding a youthful lady of early
middle-age.
The Chekhov was followed on Tuesday by a modern variant, John Fletcher's The
Apple Orchard. In April, 2005 AD, after the nuclear war, a dilapidated
garage in Somerset stands in for the Ranyevskys' bankrupt estate, and there
Harold grows apples and Sam (a girl) works secretly on electronics. Isabelle
and Jonathan, Sam's sister and brother, have continued life in London; now
hard up, they visit their old garage in an old Morris Traveller. They are
appalled to hear that the Parish Council is to take their old garage yard to
grow food. There is much philosophy, a barely relevant former vicar and a
quite irrelevant baby. Then Jonathan and Isabelle set off for Barnstable, on
foot, for Sam has pinched their carburettor for her secret 'plane, in which
she flies off to start a new community in Iona. A miraculous crop of
mushrooms will raise funds (though they are radio-active). There are some
ready references to Chekhov - missing socks for missing galoshes,
space-invader games for billiards. Nigel Bryant directed, and at any rate it
was more convincing than All in the Same Boat.
Sunday's Radio 4 Debate considered whether 'Britain is failing to consider
the future of the arts.' The result was a predictable win for the motion
(133-41), the debate being held in the Lyttelton Theatre. Iain Ritchie, of
the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, and Anthony Everett both made the valid
point that the future of the arts depended more on the people than the
funds, or, as Christopher Gable vigorously held, more on local than national
authorities.
Costing the Earth is a green campaign of eight weekly programmes on Radio 4,
Saturdays, repeated Wednesdays. The household-sounding name fits the style,
which introduces an eco-trained householder now and then to remind us about
things like not leaving the light on. This first programme featured an
eco-boxing match between Teresa Gorman, MP and Jonathan Porritt, not yet MP,
about the worth of such current green doctrines as the greenhouse effect. We
heard about the Filipinos' scheme to use old nuclear subs to generate
electricity; about the proposed stabilisation of carbon dioxide; about the
burning of oremulsion. Dylan Winter was given a little trip to see the
Scarborough sewage treatment, which frankly I found more interesting than
his trip across the US.

MARTHA by Agnes de Mille Hutchinson Pounds 20, 500 pages
BLOOD MEMORY by Martha Graham Macmillan Pounds 20, 278 pages
MARTHA GRAHAM died last year at the age of 96. She was central to the
creation of American modern dance as performer, teacher and choreographer.
Whether we may separate the dancer from the dance, and understand Graham
best as a supreme performer whose creations were a vehicle for her genius in
movement, is a matter critical opinion has to address. Certainly Graham
danced for far too long, making her final stage appearances when she was in
her seventies. It is arguable that even 20 years before that, her
performances were tinged with those hazards which make one freeze with
embarrassment in the theatre. Her later works, denied her full physical
presence, smacked more of formula than of inspiration. And she had by then
been taken over by her other role - as sybil in what she called 'the house
of the pelvic truth'.
By the extreme span of her longevity, Graham connected the first aspirations
of free dance in America - as propounded by the quaint activities of Ruth
St. Denis in the early years of this century - with the extreme
experimentation of the 1960s and '70s. Indeed, she outlived her own art. Yet
for more than 20 years, when the force of her dance powers fuelled her
creative drive, and the integrity of her manner and that of her troupe gave
physical and psychic weight to the style she had evolved, Graham was of huge
significance.
It is important to stress this time-scale since the value of Agnes de
Mille's biography of Graham lies in the fact that the author, nine years
Graham's junior and her friend for more than half a century, saw the career
and life, and recalls them in writing bold and sometimes acerbic. De Mille's
text is really brilliant table-talk. There are other, inordinately worthy
biographies and studies of Graham, which supply more facts - sometimes more
correct facts  - and lengthier disquisitions about the Graham repertory.
What de Mille gives us are memories of the woman and dancer, vivid, brisk -
she is merciless with the dreadful Ted Shawn, husband of Ruth St Denis in a
mariage blanc - and a passionate assessment of Graham's work, as is proper
from one professional theatre artist to another. (Her description of the
first performance of Primitive Mysteries in 1931 is a stunning re-creation
of a great event in Graham's career.)
De Mille is exceptionally good in placing Graham in her time. The
Neighborhood Playhouse in New York comes grandly alive, as does Louis Horst,
musician, mentor, lover, and the most influential figure in Graham's story.
And de Mille is not reverential about those later years when Graham was
turned into an institution. The hugely-overdue end of her dancing career,
the massive drinking, the reverberations from her fraught relationship with
Erick Hawkins, are a sad tale. The marketing of the ancient, arthritic and
face-lifted Graham, turned into something like a Bunraku doll decked out in
Halston dresses and Black-glama mink, while outside forces start to
manipulate the Graham troupe and legend, makes for equally sorry reading.
While de Mille was working on her text she sought her subject's help, only
to be told that Graham was writing her own autobiography. This has now
appeared under the suitably Graham-esque title Blood Memory and it is a
fairly resistible offering. Of course Graham makes fascinating comments upon
her work, and there are rare and illuminating photographs, but it is a
fragmentary document, and featherweight anecdote is given an oracular
tag-line to endow it with spurious significance. Do we need to know that a
weekly telephone conversation with Betty Ford is 'another example of what
Emily Dickinson meant by 'an act of light''? The text suggests the idea of
the aged Graham as the Delphic pythoness being interviewed for Hello
magazine, and ever ready to drop a name, be it Margot Fonteyn or Madonna.
There is a cast of thousands, from Lotte Lehmann to Ted Shawn (whom Graham
recalls recruiting young men by asking them to send nude photographs of
themselves). This is the Martha Graham given to dire and winsome statements
and surrounded by the beautiful people. Agnes de Mille provides the proper
antidote when she recounts how Paul Taylor, in rehearsal with Graham,
reacted to some pretentious suggestion with the cry of 'What a pile of
shit]' - a comment with which the reader may well sympathise .
But there is a passage in Graham's text which opens up a vaster aspect of
Graham's art than is found in these ramblings. One of Graham's dancers of
the 1930s described her to me as 'a breath-taking performer'. In her
autobiography Graham observes: 'I never really cared for choreographing . .
. I think I really only started to choreograph so that I could have
something to show off in. It came as a great shock to me when I stopped
dancing that I was honoured for my choreography.' Is this the ultimate
pelvic truth about Martha Graham: a great dancer mistaken for a great
choreographer?

SALEM IS MY DWELLING PLACE: A LIFE OF NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE by Edwin Haviland
Miller Duckworth Pounds 25, 596 pages
NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE: TRADITION AND REVOLUTION by Charles Swann Cambridge
University Press Pounds 35, 284 pages
THE SAVAGE vindictiveness of the 17th century Salem witch-hunt, so well
dramatised by Arthur Miller in The Crucible, left its trauma on the
high-minded descendants of its perpetrators. The notion of predetermined
guilt, of an ineradicable stain, is the key to the Romances and many of the
shorter tales of the great New England novelist, Nathaniel Hawthorne. Two
new books show how the guilt that afflicts so many of his characters is
related to historical events.
A scholarly biography of Hawthorne by Edwin Haviland Miller, professor of
English emeritus at New York University, focuses to begin with on two of
Nathaniel's forebears. William Hathorne - as the name was originally spelt -
settled in Salem from England in 1636. William was a soldier and a merciless
judge, who once ordered an offending Quaker woman to be stripped to the
waist, tied to a cart, and then flogged as it moved through the streets. It
was his son John, an army colonel and a magistrate during the trials of the
1690s, who meted out equally cruel punishments to Salem women accused of
witchcraft on the flimsiest, most contrived evidence.
In making fiction out of the excesses of his Puritan ancestors, Hawthorne
anticipated the technique of a modern movie-director. He was a master of
crowd scenes, as in The Scarlet Letter, and of a subtle choice of
camera-angles as in his most enchanting book, The House of the Seven Gables,
where he tracks in and out of the various rooms in the house and highlights
its curious structure containing relics of one prominent New England family
 -his own  - over several generations.
Hawthorne's favourite trick is the dissolve. He uses it incessantly in his
work to show how past impinges on present. In Gables, he transports the
reader from the founding generation to the present villain, Judge Pyncheon,
who reincarnates Hawthorne's ancestor. Pyncheon is shown tyrannising his
feckless cousin Clifford. This gentle aesthete likes to do nothing better
than blow soap-bubbles - an instance of Hawthorne inventing an image of the
kind of old man he felt he might easily become, but in fact did not.
Miller's book is strong on this family context. When he turns to
interpreting the texts, he opts for the straight Freudian explanation of
Hawthorne's sometimes painfully revealing obsessions. Hawthorne's sailor
father died at sea when the novelist was a small child; he became fixated on
a mother, who withdrew into a world of her own. Then, after a long
engagement, Hawthorne married Sophia Peabody, who gave him the abundance of
affection his childhood had lacked. Sophia's older sister, the spinster
Elizabeth Peabody, achieved her immortality when she became Miss Birdseye in
Henry James's The Bostonians.
The Hawthornes lived at different times throughout their happy marriage in
Salem, Concord and Lenox. Sophia produced two daughters and a son, all of
whom whom she adored second only to her husband, whom she thought of either
as the Adam of a new Eden or as a reincarnation of the sun-god Apollo. For a
while he was adored, too, by Melville, who dedicated Moby Dick to Hawthorne
 -a passion not returned. Hawthorne's oedipal subconscious drives were
firmly focused on the female maternal breast so prominent in The Scarlet
Letter, where the heroine's is branded with a capital A.
Charles Swann of the University of Keele, in his critical study Nathaniel
Hawthorne: Tradition and Revolution, thinks the psychiatric couch approach
to Hawthorne has been much over-done. He finds a fascinating wealth of
evidence of Hawthorne's imagination drawing sustenance from the troubled of
past of New England, and he discerns in some of the works a spirit of
inquiry into the nature of fiction. Swann dissects at great length, and with
breath-taking subtlety, The Marble Faun in the light of the Christian notion
of the Fortunate Fall. He also examines it as a classic case of an
unfinished work.
Both writers are in no doubt as to the importance of some of the uncompleted
posthumously published material which has become available in recent years -
The Elixir of Life manuscript, and the less well-known tales, now all
gathered together in the Tales and Sketches volume in the Library of America
series. Each offers an interpretation of that strange tale, 'The Appeal of
Alice Doane' which opens on Gallows Hill, Salem, on a pleasant summer
afternoon in the present. Then, in a typical Hawthorne dissolve, the setting
reverts to being the dreaded site of execution in the 17th century. A
procession of those who have been hanged comes into view, followed by a long
line of their accusers. Isolated in the rear on horseback is Cotton Mather
'. . . proud of his well-won dignity, as the representative of all the
hateful features of his time; the one blood-thirsty man, in whom were
concentrated those vices of sprit and errors of opinion, that sufficed to
madden the whole surrounding multitude'. That was a stunningly brave
denunciation when Hawthorne penned it.
Hawthorne's books sold only moderately well in his lifetime. He was haunted
not merely by the past, but also by his creditors. He had been a class-mate
at Bowdoin College of Franklin Pierce, whose career was in government. That
led to Hawthorne's preferment to lucrative jobs at the Boston and Salem
Customs Houses. It was in the Boston one that he discovered the original
embroidered scarlet letter which set in train his book. Or so he said.
When Pierce stood for President, Hawthorne wrote his campaign biography at
his friend's request, but to the dismay of those who hated the candidate's
anti-abolitionist views. Hawthorne was rewarded by being made American
consul at Liverpool at the age of 49. It was a grimly uncongenial place for
a fastidious New England family searching all the while for Bunyan's
Celestial City: but they survived it. Hawthorne amassed a small fortune in
shipping fees, enabling him to retire to Italy after Pierce failed to be
re-nominated for a second term as President.
It was during their stay in Rome that Hawthorne's older daughter Una
contracted near-fatal malaria, never fully to recover, and the decline in
his fortunes began. Back home in New England he suffered a complete
crack-up. It is a moving story - well told here by Miller on a broad canvas,
with many of the minor characters, like the transcendentalist Margaret
Fuller and the publisher James Field, neatly etched in. In spite of
stylistic archaisms, Hawthorne remains capable of an incomparable richness
of texture which both these books help us to appreciate more fully than
hitherto.

DAMON RUNYON: A LIFE by Jimmy Breslin Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 17.99, 410
pages
IT IS a mixed blessing for a writer to have an -esque appended to his name.
On the one hand, it is a sure ticket to immortality, an easy entry into
general parlance. On the other, it tends to ensure a trivialisation of the
work, an emphasis on certain superficial qualities at the expense of the
core. This is surely the case with Damon Runyon. If someone refers to a
robber who locks his keys in the getaway car as being Runyonesque, just
about everybody gets the point. Yet who still reads Runyon's quirky short
stories of the lovable lowlifes who inhabited Broadway during the Roaring
Twenties?
Jimmy Breslin's study of this remarkable writer does much to redress the
imbalance, painting a vibrant portrait of a man equally representative of
his times as more enduring writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald. Runyon was born
in 1880 in Manhattan - Manhattan, Kansas, that is, a frontier backwater
about as far from Broadway as you could get. His father was a drunken
newspaperman who travelled with the US Army in the Indian Wars. Runyon was
forced to look after himself after the early death of his mother, landing
his first reporting job at the age of 12, covering hangings, fires and
prizefights for a Colorado newspaper. By 18 he was sending back dispatches
from the Philippine War, by 25 he was a well-respected journalist who had
also published a few short stories. But it was not until he landed a
sportswriting job with Hearst's New York American that he really hit his
stride. While others were dutifully reporting scores and quoting managers,
Runyon would trail the team drunk on his early morning exploits, earning him
an entree into the Broadway netherworld that was to become his milieu for
the next three decades.
It was a career packed with astonishing incident. At one moment we see
Runyon gaining an exclusive interview with Pancho Villa (in which he met the
12-year-old housegirl who was to become his second wife), the next has him
trading jibes with Al Capone or Bugsy Seigel. In the one of the book's most
remarkable episodes, Runyon is able to avenge himself on his wife's lover, a
mediocre boxer, by using his journalistic pull to arrange a fight between
the lover and an up-and-coming Joe Louis. Every night he would prowl
Broadway, picking up bits and characters that he would later turn into
countless short stories, many of which would subsequently be made into
movies such as Little Miss Marker (which launched Shirley Temple), The Big
Street and, posthumously, Guys and Dolls. As Breslin notes, 'the night gave
Runyon material; he got it the only way you can, by hanging out with people
for hours.'
Breslin, New York's most famous living newspaperman, is a fitting biographer
for Runyon, sharing with him both a love of the city's streetlife and a
distrust for those in power. Here, he employs a breathless, anecdotal style
that proves a far more apt mirror to Runyon's life than the more sober tones
of a conventional scholar. His description of a dank newsroom is more useful
than a hundred old photos: 'Yellow flypaper strung from the ceiling, leaving
those searching for a word with dead flies for inspiration.' Breslin also
possesses a wonderful sense of irony about the workings of New York itself,
a city founded on larceny both grand and petty that manages nonetheless to
maintain its charm and scruffy humanity. A Runyonesque city, that is.
Breslin never romanticises his subject, however. From the moment we see our
pre-teen hero sitting hand-in-hand with a whore to watch a lynch victim
swing in the evening breeze, Runyon comes across as a cold fish indeed, a
merciless observer who neglected wife and children, a ruthlessly ambitious
writer whose steely blue eyes took everything in while giving precious
little away. Perhaps it was for the better, though. After all, not many men
could hang out with Al Capone and live to write about it.

THE MAN WITH NIGHT SWEATS Thom Gunn Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 11.99/Pounds 5.99,
88 pages
THE THOM Gunn 'thing' is a kind of sudden but smoothly achieved emphasis on
an abstract state ('Nothing moves / at the edges of the mind', from the 1967
volume, Touch), an exploration of wilful, restless states; ('One is always
nearer by not keeping still', from the earlier Sense of Movement), or a
delineation of impersonal force - that 'disinterested hard energy' with
which 'My Sad Captains' turn 'like the stars'. It is a poetic voice
responding variously to post-war Sartrean existentialism, the aesthetic
tough-mindedness of Gunn's temporary mentor Yvor Winters, and Gunn's
personal experience as a homosexual.
Though I suppose Gunn has been 'out' as a homosexual for most of his life
(he moved to San Francisco in 1960 when he was 31), he only came out in
verse with the 1982 volume lubriciously entitled The Passages of Joy; but
reading his earlier work with hindsight one cannot fail to be aware of a
mode of perception and sensibility that is quite specifically 'gay': perhaps
one could describe it as an enchanted critique of the imperatives of
toughness. In Passages there were poems actually about gay sex; and in its
successor, Gunn's latest verse collection, The Man with Night Sweats, that
sensibility and perception are as distinct as ever, but the sex act has been
largely supplanted by the death act, and in the tragedy of AIDS Gunn has
found his natural unnatural subject.
The last of the book's four sections is devoted to AIDS pieces, which Gunn
wishes to stand as memorials to the friends whose miseries and braveries
inspired them (their names are listed in an afterword), and which amount to
a significant expansion of the scope of poetry. Loss and death have always
been lyric poetry's proper domain, but hardly ever before have the
discomfort, bewilderment and sheer existential fact of dying been taken over
so decisively by verse. Not even Douglas Dunn's superb book of Elegies
(1985) for his wife who died from cancer gives quite so sharp a focus to the
subjective experience of dying: the poet's concern is primarily his own
bereavement. But in Gunn's title-poem and pieces like 'Lament', 'Sacred
Heart' and 'Courtesies of the Interregnum', he penetrates with dazzling
empathy into the inward agony of dying, is somehow able, though not directly
threatened by death himself, to render its appalling lonely specificity.
Gunn has risen to his inescapable new subject with verse of quiddity and
depth and terrible truthfulness. Among the book's other sections are equally
fine pieces such as 'Nasturtium' and the AIDS-related 'All Do Not All Things
Well' and some acute vignettes of low life (''Well Dennis O'Grady', 'Old
Meg') which recall Gunn's manner in the delightful 1966 collection of his
poems and his brother's photographs, Positives, a title that would seem
harshly ironic now.

BEATRICE WEBB: WOMAN OF CONFLICT by Carole Seymour-Jones Allison &amp; Busby
Pounds 17.99, 369 pages
HISTORY has not been kind to Beatrice Webb. Revered by her first two
biographers, the correction came with Kitty Muggeridge's 1967 depiction of
her 'aunt Bo' as a puritanical Fabian social reformer who, with her husband
Sidney, wrote 'unreadable books' and approved of Stalin's Russia because
there was no 'spooning' in the parks. Now Carole Seymour-Jones gives her
excellent new biography a feminist tinge: Beatrice's story is a 'very modern
one' because it is a 'story of choices'. The result is to make Beatrice's
life memorable more for the contradictions it embodied than for the reforms
it achieved.
Born in 1858, one of eight daughters, Beatrice grew up in a free-thinking
household where her father Richard Potter, a rich railway magnate, included
Thomas Huxley and Herbert Spencer among his friends. Already questioning the
'repugnant' doctrine of Atonement at the age of sixteen, like many
Victorians she lost her faith but found a calling, following her elder
sister Kate into the service of Octavia Hill, the model housing pioneer in
London's East End. Women's Suffrage and reform of the Poor Laws were burning
issues of the day, and Seymour-Jones's social history teems with
descriptions of personalities and pressure-groups, vividly conveying the
social and intellectual ferment surrounding Beatrice's choice of life.
Agonising in her diary between marriage and independence, motherhood or good
works, the severest test to Beatrice's passionate nature came from Joseph
Chamberlain, the charismatic leader of the Radicals in the 1880s. The
physical infatuation, unfulfilled, lasted six years and brought her to the
brink of nervous collapse: 'If I were a man,' she told herself, 'this
creature would be free, though not dissolute, in its morals, a lover of
women . . . the strong physical nature upon which the intellectual nature is
based would be satisfied.'
Too volatile for Chamberlain's needs, in Sidney Webb, the unprepossessing
son of a Cockney hairdresser, she found someone whose socialist beliefs were
at least a match for her mind if not her heart: 'I do not even look at your
photographs,' she told him when he sat for a new photograph, 'It is too
hideous, for anything. Do be done in a gray suit and let me have your head
only - it is the head only I am marrying]' Submitting to Beatrice's
elocution lessons Sidney played his one trump card, his intellectual
ambition, to perfection - his wife's in-bred belief that men ruled and women
supported had earlier led her to sign Mrs Humphrey Ward's Anti-Suffrage
Appeal in 1889.
In the event, the Fabianism which the Webbs, with George Bernard Shaw,
founded was elitist, anti-democratic and more a patrician parlour-game than
a political power base. They misread the rise of the Labour movement, which
was to mark their eclipse, likening themselves instead to a Samurai 'elect'
who would do the thinking for the untutored masses. Beatrice's taste for the
good life never left her; after dinner parties spent 'webb-pulling' (as
their enemies termed it) with the likes of Balfour, Asquith and Ramsey
Macdonald, she would scribble down the seating plan in her diary as a
trophy.
Soviet Communism: A New Civilisation?, the pamphlet they published following
their visit to Russia in 1932, when Beatrice was 74, proved a lamentable
curtain-call. Ignoring protests from former disciples Beatrice thought the
1931-2 Russian famine a 'partial crop failure' and dismissed Stalin's
show-trials as merely the 'growing pains' of a new civilisation. Depressed
by the apparent collapse of worldwide capitalism, the Webbs' enthusiasm for
Stalin's elitist new order was fuelled by a strangely inhuman quality in
themselves, which led them to ignore individual suffering in favour of the
needs of the State ('Sidney tends to ignore personalities and I study them
as specimens,' she once wrote).
In her personal life, despite regrets over lost motherhood, Beatrice's
fevered spirit did at last gain a restfulness ('It is very sweet, this warm
companionship in work'). Their ashes now lie in Westminster Abbey, the only
couple to be so honoured. It is typically English tribute to two heroic
failures.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Gardening: Count on pig-power to spring some surprises - For
horticultural health and strength, Robin Lane Fox takes delivery of a load
of his favourite old-fashioned manure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE crocuses are spectacular in the sunshine; the catkins on my Italian
alders are dropping pools of yellow pollen wherever I put them as cut
flowers. It is not for this reason that I know spring is round the corner: I
know it because the pig manure has come.
So, I fear, do quite a few others. On Friday the electricity board sent its
man to read the meter; he was duly impounded by the man who had already
settled in upstairs to test the burglar alarm; both of them then set off the
alarm without realising it. The police arrived and took them by storm.
No sooner had the police parked their car than the usual young man arrived
with his annual tractor-load of urine-free pig manure, which he dropped with
his usual care in its usual place - which happens to be directly behind the
police car's parking space. It has been hard to persuade the boys in blue
that I do not have serious unidentified enemies; people, perhaps, for whom
the Unauthorised Version has set alarm bells ringing, considering it all a
load of, well, peat-free, shredded high-nitrogen soil conditioner.
Horticulturally, this particular soil-conditioner seems to work like
explosive. It is much too strong for legumes, beans, young seedlings and
sweet peas. It is not too strong for roses, which seem to love it, and it
adds a new depth of colour to the cheeks of a hosta with fleshy leaves.
I look with amusement at the polythene packs of 'compost' - nearly 10 times
as much each - from garden shops. My treated manure is peat-free and
pre-crumbled, but it costs only Pounds 50 for a big load and lasts for a
season.
It adds both texture and tang to shrubs, hedging plants and anything for
which you need to break up the sub-soil with compost before planting. It
never becomes wet or soggy, and you might even mistake it for lightly-mixed
chocolate cake unless you approached it down-wind before the first ardour
had cooled.
This weekend, the last thing that ardent planters should be doing is to cool
off. Whether or not they live near a pig farm, they have a great chance to
plant bare-rooted stocks before garden centres pot them up into big litre
pots of peat and sell them as if they were twice their real size and worth
twice the money.
My routine for bare root planting is simple: a fork, a crowbar, a bucket of
water and a barrow of vintage cochon, '91. It has all the nose and ability
to open on the scenting-buds which Edmund Penning-Rowsell, Weekend FT's
wines expert, admires in the finer chateaux. It will be admirable for my
remaining old-fashioned roses and the named delphiniums which have been
sitting around since the dry summer.
The crowbar is necessary because of my eccentric soil. In the post-glacial
era, my soil acquired a layer of round stones at a depth of only a few
inches. If punctured, this lateral beach gives way to a light, open subsoil
which drains quickly and mixes wonderfully with manure. The matter of
planting, however, involves tenacious thumping with a crowbar in most of the
garden in order to break through the earth's crust.
Fork, water and manure are of more general value. The fork will break up the
lower soil: if you are planting a tree or shrub, you must dig a larger hole
down than the roots require and, even then, break it up and mix in some
manure. In due course the roots will run downwards into an unexpected
heaven. The water allows you to soak the bare roots of everything for an
hour or so before you plant it. Recently, spring has been extremely dry;
from now on, I would not plant bare-rooted stock directly from a carrier's
package.
It is on hedging that I most notice piggish influence. Box and yew appear to
revel in it; so does my particular favourite, the evergreen Osmanthus.
Osmanthus Burkwoodi is now a correct name for the old Osmarea: if you space
plants about three feet apart it makes a thick hedge of olive green leaves
to a height of about six feet, with as much of a girth as you allow. The
colour is almost Mediterranean, and a heavy dressing of pig manure helps it
to shine.
Next month it will be covered with white tubular flowers of quite a
different scent: to enjoy them, you must prune it only in the week or two
after flowering. Longer growths may tempt you this weekend, but if you cut
at the wrong time, you will lose the flowers.
Under hostas, pig-power is unmistakable. I would urge everyone to try a bag
because it works such wonders on leaves. The blue and yellow-leaved forms
are all very pretty, but there is one variety which is in a special class
for careful gardeners. Hosta plantaginea has sweet white scented flowers
above plain green leaves in August. Edwardian gardeners used to plant it on
the shaded side of a house where they could enjoy the scent in high summer.
I will be copying them, adding manure for special effect.
In five months time, it is hard to imagine that gardens will be looking
tired after a hard summer. I am anticipating hostas with a sweet, fresh
scent, but only because I will have packed them this weekend with a pungent,
throaty layer from the pigsty.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Gardening: Anyone can start a colony - Some of the prettiest
perennials for spring planting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMON montbretia is usually regarded as rather a weed; a plant very
easy to get into the garden, but much more difficult to get out.
It makes a mass of running roots with little bulbs - more accurately, corms
 -along their length. Some are almost certain to get detached if one tries
to dig a plant out, so any one is capable of starting a new colony. The
flowers, widely-flared yellow and bronzey-red tubes on slender branched
stems, are pretty enough in late summer and early autumn, but the plants are
so dense and invasive that they often overrun more valuable things. There
comes a time when one regrets having ever planted this particular
montbretia.
But while the common type may not be very attractive, it is not
characteristic of the family as a whole. Botanically these plants are no
longer called Montbretia, but crocosmia; they include several valuable
late-flowering herbaceous perennials which are all suitable for planting in
spring.
Indeed, they are often included in spring bulb lists, although the most
satisfactory way of obtaining them is not as dry corms but as growing tufts,
ready to start away directly they are put into the soil. None of these
montbretia relatives is anything like such an overwhelming plant as the
common kind. Some are even a little tender, and need to be treated with
respect.
This is certainly true of what I regard as the most beautiful of all,
Crocosmia masonorum. This has erect, sword-shaped, prominently ribbed leaves
which are attractive in themselves, and the slender yet rigid flower stems
curl over at the top to display, almost upside down, a short spike of
closely packed reddish-orange flowers. There is also a new all-yellow
variety named Rowallane Yellow, which is being released this spring by
Bressingham Gardens, Bressingham, Diss, Norfolk.
In its habit, Crocosmia masonorum is immediately recognisable from the rest
of this family, and it has passed on some of its character to a series of
fine hybrids made by Alan Bloom of Bressingham Nurseries, who used this
plant and another species named Crocosmia paniculata. Just to get things
really tangled up, Alan Bloom uses the old name for this plant, Antholyza
paniculata, so do not be surprised to find this name in the Bressingham
Gardens catalogue.
It is another fine plant, taller and stronger growing than C masonorum,
making big clumps but without the tendency to ramble all over the place like
the common montbretia. I like it very much, both as a foliage plant and when
bearing its small spikes of deep scarlet flowers in summer. The flower stems
bend over at the top - but not quite so far as those of C masonorum - so
that the flowers actually face upwards. It has passed on this habit to some
of the Bressingham hybrids which tend to have larger individual flowers but
not be quite so tall.
Probably the best of the lot is Lucifer, also a slightly lighter shade of
red. This is a first class border plant and also a very good cut flower and,
with me, it has always proved to be completely hardy. So, I must add, has
Crocosmia paniculata, though years ago it used to be treated as if it were a
little tender and given sunny sheltered places.
Other members of these Bloom hybrid Crocosmias include Emberglow, which is
shorter in growth and has duskier flowers which Alan Bloom describes as
burnt orange-red; Bressingham Beacon, which has orange and yellow flowers;
and Jennie Bloom, with smaller but very numerous, deep yellow flowers with
more of the typical montbretia character.
Yet another hybrid, but from a different source, is Severn Sunrise. This was
raised by Vera Cattermole and Paul Durrant, who used to work for Bloom's
Nurseries. This crocosmia appeared as a chance seedling in their nursery in
Wales so little is known about its parentage, but its appearance suggests
that the seed came from one of the Bloom hybrids. I have not seen it but
Bloom's Nurseries, which sells it, describe it as 'glowing orange subtly
tinged with pink as the flowers fade, compact and ideal for the smaller
garden.'
Which brings me back to what gardeners still call montbretias. There are
still some very superior varieties that, far from taking charge of the
garden, tend to disappear in winter unless they are dug up in the autumn and
over-wintered in a frame. This I have found true of varieties such as His
Majesty, Queen of Spain and Star of the East, which all have widely-flared
flowers of very good size and quality.
It has also been partly true in my garden of Emily McKenzie, a fine variety
that is widely available and seems to grow well in many places, but which
with me lives for a year or so and then fades away. I do not know why. But
there are some good varieties that do seem more reliable, two of the best
being Citronella and Solfaterre. The former has small but numerous yellow
flowers and makes a good clump of narrow, typically montbretia leaves, the
whole plant 2 ft or little more in height. Solfaterre is remarkable for
having bronze leaves and pale apricot yellow flowers. Neither seems to have
any inclination to behave aggressively.
Some of the failures with these plants may be due to drought. Certainly, in
dry places leaves do tend to wither in summer but I have never been sure
that this is not due to disease. Certainly, it is possible to see crocosmias
of all kinds growing surprisingly well near water.

Stachyurus praecox The flowers of this remarkable Japanese shrub look like
little bead curtains hanging from the bare branches in stiff, three inch
long, light yellow trails. These upside down spikes (strictly racemes for
the little flowers have very short stalks) are formed in the autumn and
remain fully exposed all the winter until the flowers actually open some
time in February or March, yet they rarely get damaged and the bush itself
is perfectly hardy. It has large, broadly lance-shaped leaves which are
pleasant without being remarkable. It likes peat but does not seem to object
to some lime in the soil

FT  07 MAR 92 / French Property: Leaseback pioneer hits environmental snags
 -'Greens' make life tough for leisure leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVELLING around the coasts and ski resorts of France, you might have
noticed the name Pierre &amp; Vacances. You might even have thought it rather
odd in translation: Peter and Holidays.
In fact, it is not really translatable. 'Investment in leisure' is probably
the closest you get, for the group is a leading French leisure/property
developer and tour operator. On the one hand, it builds and sells holiday
properties; on the other, it rents them out. It is expanding into Spain and
Portugal and has just opened an office in London (071-495-2414).
The group's interest in leisure began in the 1960s when, during a period of
tremendous expansion in the industry, it created the traffic-free resort of
Avoriaz in the French alps, offering apartments and facilities for
holidaymakers.
It then undertook their management for private owners and institutional
investors. As it increased the number of its developments, it provided a
growing range of services for owners and now has 100 complexes in 50
locations in France, representing 20,000/25,000 apartments and 72,000 beds
available for letting. Overall, the average price of its apartments is
Pounds 60,000, although it has villas on the Cote d'Azur at up to Pounds 1m.
Surveys by the group showed that people who bought holiday apartments used
them for only four to eight weeks a year. So, leaseback was born. If a buyer
wishes, he can pay 30 per cent less for an apartment, furnish it, and lease
it to the group for 11 years. During that time, he can use it himself for
six weeks annually. He has no maintenance or management charges to pay and
P&amp;V guarantees to hand the property back at French government 'three-star'
standard.
The group has sold 15,000 of its apartments under leaseback (of which there
are variations), although many buyers still prefer outright ownership and
the freedom to use their property when they choose.
P&amp;V has a range of resorts and complexes in the mountains and along the
Mediterranean coast, while others are appearing on France's Atlantic coast
and in the Channel area. It plans its apartments carefully. There is a
warehouse near Paris where mock-ups of new designs are built and tried out
and where there are experiments with finishes and furnishing.
The group's integrated resorts may have restaurants, hotels, swimming pools,
tennis, riding, perhaps a lake for water sports. A number have golf courses,
including Port Bourgenay on the Atlantic coast. Built as a seaside village
in 290 acres, it also has a small marina and a sandy beach. Three-bedroom
terrace properties with views over the fairways cost Pounds 89,000 for
outright ownership and are available now. Apartments start at Pounds 33,000
for studios (outright ownership) or Pounds 22,900 (leaseback). Available in
June.
Aiguemer takes in 225 acres on the shores of the St Tropez peninsular. Its
18-hole course will run alongside the beach and a selection of properties is
being built there. One-bedroom apartments are from Pounds 77,000 (outright
ownership) and Pounds 45,000 (leaseback) while two-bedroom golf houses are
Pounds 132,000 (outright ownership). The completion date is 1997.
There are various similar projects in hand by P&amp;V, a private group of
companies in which the Bremond family still holds nearly 80 per cent.
Partners include Credit Agricole, Credit Foncier and the insurance group
Axa, Net profit last year was something over Pounds 7m.
So is it all plain sailing for P&amp;V? Not quite. Some people say leaseback is
not a good system in times of recession and that units could be difficult to
re-sell part-way through a contract. The group disagrees and says: 'Of
course people can re-sell' - but they have to do so subject to the rental
contract, or negotiate another. It adds that, normally, there is somebody
quite happy to buy within the contract.
P&amp;V has another problem: the 'green people,' as staff call environmentalists
who claim it is spoiling the landscape. For obvious reasons, the group's
leisure developments are in attractive areas and some of the sites are
large.
Permission for a golf course can lead to a lot of housing around it and the
environmentalists have been objecting. A new resort, Cap Esterel, a short
drive from Cannes, spreads over 500 acres. It has a golf course, swimming
pool complex and Provencal-style village, with shops. But the greens
protested to the authorities and the planned 18-hole course was cut to nine.
The number of residential units has been reduced and an area of the
development 'frozen' for building.
Another project, at Gassin near St Tropez, was to have had a 27-hole course,
town houses, villas, apartments, a 40-bedroom hotel and swimming pool.
Development had been under way for a year when green protests resulted in
planning permission being revoked. P&amp;V has appealed.
There were objections, too, about Aiguemer, and the group appears to have
taken these to heart. Advance drawings of the project show the properties
wreathed in flowers and creepers and a landscaping company has been brought
in to find a succession of plants that will provide flowers and greenery
thoroughout the year.
Now, P&amp;V appears to be changing tack. It has taken a 5.6 per cent (likely to
be increased) stake in the 4,000-acre Sotogrande estate in southern Spain
and says it will be responsible for running the estate and future
development.
The opportunity came with a change of ownership of Sotogrande, which has
been taken over by the Spanish company Cofir. There are ambitious plans to
bring the estate 'alive' by building an inner lagoon and marina and a large
number of town houses and apartments. There will be two new golf courses and
more villas inland.
P&amp;V's joint managing director, Michel Gasteau, says the group will be
starting leaseback at Sotogrande next year. It also has other plans in Spain
and has been discussing a joint venture involving apartments with a bank.
Meanwhile, Cofir is involved in Vilamoura, on Portugal's Algarve coast, and
P&amp;V also plans to move into Portugal as well as increasing its sales network
in Italy.
So, is P&amp;V being driven out of France by envirnomentalists? Sales manager
Francois Mautaint denies this although he admits it is becoming more
difficult to get permission for beachside locations there. But the group was
becoming international and in no way retreating from France, he said.

MANY BRITONS who buy in France do not speak the language and this often
leads to difficulties with bills and correspondence. French addresses can be
confusing. Which slip do you put in with the rates, electricity, water and
telephone accounts? Writing a cheque on your local bank might seem simple
enough - but not if you do not know the French words for the amount.
To cope with all this, London estate agency Rutherfords (071-351-4454),
which sells French property, runs an administration service. For Pounds 110
a year, you can pass over your correspondence and it will tell you how to
deal with each item.
Not paying a bill might mean having a service cut off. There was a man who
thought a huge electricity account at his French property was a mistake. The
agency looked into it - and found that he had forgotten to turn off the
electricity. He had also left the refrigerator on - with the door open.

FT  07 MAR 92 / French Property: Quiet corners with bargains galore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH property market in Britain is more lively than at the end of last
year. Busier with people looking, at any rate.
For those who may feel they have heard enough of popular areas, we asked
agents to suggest some lesser-known corners of France in which to look for a
tranquil hideaway.
Try Ariege, in southern France, says one. He has a converted mill there,
with the mill house on three levels. It has a living room with exposed
beams, four bedrooms, central heating and views over the mountains. The mill
race runs under the mill and emerges through a stone vault.
The attraction of Ariege? 'A nine-mile drive along narrow roads, followed by
a three-mile walk on a footpath (or a cross-country ski over a few peaks),
will get you to the borders of tax-free Andorra, or Spain.' Almost three
countries for the price of one. The price of the mill? Barbers
(071-381-0112) is asking Pounds 70,000.
Water mills seem to be in fashion this spring. Another agency suggests one
on the edge of the Charente, between Confolens and Limoges, set in 17 acres
of rural land. The mill, plus cottage, face a lake. A fast-flowing stream
feeds the lake and the waterfall could drive a generator.
There is a living room, three bedrooms and central heating in the mill, and
two bedrooms in the cottage. 'A quick purchaser might get a bargain for
under Pounds 100,000,' says Waterside Properties International
(081-944-0400).
Head for south-west Lot-et-Garonne, near the Landes forest, advises Michael
Treganowan, of the French Property Shop (0892-852-449) 'The area has strict
regulations about commercialisation and its peace is assured. It is
relatively unknown, free from tourists and property prices are realistic.'
He picks a farmhouse in 12 acres in the heart of a pine forest on the edge
of the Landes region. There is a large living room, study, four bedrooms,
central heating, garage and an independent stone building for renovation.
For day to day needs, a village is about a mile away. Price: Pounds 74,000.
The agency has nearly 400 more properties on its books this season,
passed-on by French associates who seem optimistic that the British
recession is all but over.
Caroline Jenkins used to be conveyancing manager with a London estate
agency, selling French property. She is now with a firm of notaries in
Frejus, on the south coast of France.
She says there are bargains to be had in the little-known villages just
inland from Frejus, with most vendors open to 'discussing' the price. The
properties may need renovation but some are only half an hour from the
beaches and can be found for between Pounds 35,000 and Pounds 45,000.
They are often on two or three floors with not more than two rooms per
floor. 'But it makes a change from the flats sold with their own mooring
overlooking the port, most of which are fetching over Pounds 100,000,' she
points out.
One Frejus agency, Europazur (tel: 94 51 55 88), which is English-speaking,
has properties from Pounds 24,000. This would buy a balconied, two-room,
second-floor flat in the town, just over a mile from the beach. A
three-bedroom village house might be Pounds 40,000.
Agence Immobilia, at Bagnols-en-Foret, 20 minutes from Frejus, can offer a
four-room house with roof terrace in woodland for Pounds 30,000 (tel.
94.40.61.54). A main street house for restoration within the village could
be the same price. This agency is not English-speaking but Jenkins (office
tel: 94 51 00 05) would act as interpreter, if necessary.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Sailing: Spending millions on espionage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE 'S-words' are on everyone's lips in San Diego. Spying and spending are
the live issues as America's Cup XXVIII reaches the half-way point.
Intelligence-gathering against rival teams has reached the point where the
US Coastguard has begun to bang syndicate heads together. Local commander Al
Boty called a summit to warn the yachtsmen that ramming and barging between
tenders and chase boats had become so dangerous that the USCG would not
hesitate to intervene. At one point, the Japanese tender crashed between the
spy boat Gazzini and the Nippon yacht when the former came within 15 metres.
The Gazzini has blackened windows and the crew are never seen on deck. It is
chartered to Bill Koch, owner/skipper of the America3 defence campaign. Koch
admits openly that the vessel is the intelligence arm of his four-boat,
Dollars 60m (Pounds 34m) attempt to keep the cup in America. Indeed, many of
his 200 employees are research scientists.
It is accepted that the Gazzini fires a laser and range-finder at 'target'
yachts to measure performance. This data is then 'raced' within a computer
against the known performance of the America3 yachts - the hi-tech
equivalent of watching your opponent train. Where the matter becomes
contentious, though, is the allegations that the Gazzini is using a Star
Wars technique known as 'tempesting' to capture data off the on-board
computers of rival yachts. In the last years of the Cold War, western
agencies such as the NSA and GCHQ certainly had such techniques, and they
were deployed in the Gulf War.
'Data screens use impulses to form print-outs,' said Bill Trenkle,
operations manager for Dennis Conner's team, Stars &amp; Stripes. 'There is firm
speculation that America3 have instruments to read your screen on one of
their own.' Conner is battling Koch, with little success, for the right to
be the cup defender.
Modifications to Stars &amp; Stripes proved so disastrous that Conner had to ask
Koch's permission for extra lay-days to put the yacht back to its previous
rig and keel set-up. The white-haired Koch and his sailing mentor, Buddy
Melges, have developed a fine double act at their rival's expense. One duet
at a recent news conference ran thus.
Koch: 'Our philosophy is not to grind Dennis's nose into the mud and pound
on him.'
Melges: 'Isn't it?'
Koch: 'Our purpose is to have the best possible racing in the trials and go
on to win the America's Cup.'
Melges: 'Then go grind his nose in the mud.'
Among the eight challengers, a clear Division I and II have emerged after
two round-robins. Barring divine intervention New Zealand, France, Italy and
Japan will make the semi-finals and Australia (two teams), Sweden and Spain
will not. The linking factor is that the first four have built at least
three yachts and spent a minimum of Dollars 30m each, while the losers have
only a single boat and minimal budgets.
Now, the Italian Il Moro di Venezia group (five yachts and a dollar spend of
close to nine figures) has upped the ante still further with a revolutionary
sail development. Carbon-fibre sails were the breakthrough unveiled by Il
Moro for the third challenger round-robin starting today. Skipper Paul
Cayard says they are stronger and lighter than the Kevlar weaves now in use.
In order to maintain maximum secrecy, Il Moro has been testing the new sails
at dawn and dusk over 20 miles offshore. If they work, the extra strength
should reduce distortion as the sail wears, while extra lightness aloft
reduces the boat's inertia and improves performance in choppy conditions.
'It's the most important innovation in sail-making since Kevlar replaced
Dacron over 10 years ago,' says Cayard.
No such breakthrough stays unmatched for long, though. Koch's sail designers
have announced their own version of an ultra-light new fabric, consisting of
long-chain polymers. Koch, a scientist by training, says the molecular
structure is unique in terms of aligning itself to the stresses within the
sails. The material was used for the first time in a race on Thursday.
The Il Moro team has already spent around Dollars 60m (with more to come),
built five yachts (more than any other challenger in the cup's
141-year-history), and showed that it has no fear of a cheque-book race.
Nevertheless, Raul Gardini, its head, is advocating a pan-European defence
should either the Italians or French win the cup from the San Diego Yacht
Club in May. Interestingly, Il Moro races under the EC flag rather than the
Italian tricolour.
It remains to be seen if this is a portent or merely a signal of Gardini's
pique at being deposed from the chairmanship of the Ferruzzi group last
summer. Anyway, before the cup can become the subject of any kind of
Brussels committee meeting, the New Zealanders must be deposed from the head
of the challenger table, where they sit five points clear of Italy.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Rugby Union: Amateur code's key professional - The man who
has transformed English rugby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOMENTS before the kick-off of this afternoon's match between England and
Wales at Twickenham, a big, sandy-haired man will take his position in the
one unnumbered seat in the officials' box in the West stand. Beneath the
hair and eyebrows, there will probably be a smile on his face.
Dudley Wood can be permitted that. Rugby Union is enjoying an unprecedented
boom in popularity and Wood, the secretary of the English Rugby Football
Union, is the man who deserves the credit for transforming it into the most
modern and best-run rugby union in the world.
'I am just a hired hand', he says, modestly. 'I am the servant of The
Committee.' The reality is that Wood was the first high-powered businessman
to move from industry to rugby administration, and he has been a brilliant
success. 'It simply isn't good enough to appoint enthusiastic ex-players to
these positions any more,' he says. 'Sport is a mixture of everything from
high politics to low jokes.'
Since Wood arrived at Twickenham in August 1986, England's success on the
field has been matched by an improvement off it. Turnover? Up from Pounds 5m
to Pounds 40m. Staff? Risen from 40 to 100, including part-timers.
Ticketing? All computerised and done in-house. Seating? Increased to 60,000
and soon to be increased again, to 75,000.
After leaving Oxford with a degree in modern languages, Wood spent more than
30 years with ICI in its petrochemicals division. Retirement was nearing
when he was nudged into applying for the secretaryship of the ERFU. His
application arrived on the closing date.
When he got the job, he was horrified to discover that the telephone number
of the ERFU was ex-directory. He changed that immediately. He has initiated
an unprecedented opening-up of Twickenham, from establishing of excellent
relations with local residents to improving facilities for wheelchairs.
Journalists, used to being palmed-off with non-committal statements and
numerous no-comments, found themselves invited to regular press conferences
at which Wood and his officials would answer questions on any subject.
He fought for, and got, club-class travel for the England players and has
given a woman on his staff the responsibility of looking after the wives and
girl-friends of every player in the England development squad. The result is
that his personal standing is high and the ERFU is no longer perceived to be
an outdated, ill-managed coterie of plummy-voiced former public schoolboys.
You get Wood's measure when you discover the standing in which he is held
outside rugby. He recently received a letter from a head-hunter searching
for a new chief executive for the Squash Rackets Association. 'Since you are
widely held to be the role model for such positions, do you have any ideas?'
it read.
Wood's counsel was sought when the Football Association was searching for a
chief executive. But he says: 'I am not an ideas man. By training, I am a
marketing man. I can sell other people's ideas.'
In two particular areas, Wood's profile has been high. The first is in
fighting to maintain the view that rugby is still an amateur game. 'I regret
that I have not won that argument,' he says. 'The point is this: rugby is
better on the basis on which it is now played than on any other. We must not
throw out its greatest virtue, which is that it is a leisure activity for
those who earn a living.
'It is a sport for players who have to work on a Monday. I like the idea
that Jonathan Webb took someone's appendix out on the morning of the
Harlequins vs Bath game and that Nigel Heslop went skiing in midseason. I
was delighted when Rob Andrew was made chartered surveyor of the year. These
guys are individuals. They've got their priorities right. They have a right
to lead their own lives.'
This view is seen by some as old-fashioned - typical of an elderly
administrator who is anti-money and thus anti the England players' Run with
the Ball campaign. 'We do not have the right to stop players profiting from
activities outside rugby, like opening supermarkets, but I do draw the line
at them asking a fee for making a speech at a rugby dinner. That is taking
money out of the game. That is wrong.'
After the Run with the Ball campaign was approved by the international
board, Wood wrote in the ERFU magazine: 'In other words, rugby players, no
doubt because of their new-found fame, can receive an appropriate fee for
appearing or talking in a non-rugby milieu. Big deal] Not, I think, a
revolution or the end of an amateur sport.'
The second area in which his name is always mentioned is as an after-dinner
speaker. There are those who are self-deprecating, those who tell a string
of jokes, and those whose humour is at the expense of others. Wood belongs
to the last group. 'No one doubts his intelligence,' he said of a well-known
rugby official. 'It's just that no one ever mentions it.'
On another occasion, he stood up after a lacklustre speech by the club
chairman and asked: 'How did the charisma bypass operation go?' Such
irreverence could be dangerous coming from a paid official of the ERFU, so
it is a measure of the esteem in which Wood is held that his victims bear no
grudges.
Wood retires, aged 65, in 1995. If he carries on for the next three years as
sure-footedly as he has done for the past six, a significant reward would be
in order.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Motoring: Japanese invade Geneva - Europe's first big show
of the year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENEVA'S salon de l'automobile is the first big European motor show of the
year. Switzerland makes virtually no cars of its own and is a completely
free market in which all vehicles compete on level terms. So, a visit to the
show is as good a way as any to take the temperature of the industry. This
year, it is the Japanese who are making the running and most of the news.
Toyota has chosen Geneva for the world premiere of its new Carina E. This is
the car that will start rolling off the assembly tracks next December at the
green-field factory nearing completion at Burnaston, Derbyshire.
The Carina E is a four-door saloon or five-door hatchback, elegantly though
practically aerodynamic, with a choice of 1.6 or two-litre, multi-valve,
four-cylinder petrol engines and a two-litre diesel. It looks rather like
its up-market relatives, the Lexus and Camry.
Toyota says the Carina's 'E' tag stands for 'excellence in Europe' and
stresses that it was created to suit European tastes. It forecasts, almost
certainly correctly, that the car will prove a formidable rival to such
established Euro-favourites as the Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Vectra), Ford
Sierra, Peugeot 405, Rover 200/400 - and that product of the first Japanese
motor industry transplant in Britain, the Nissan Primera.
European buyers will not have to wait for the British-made cars.
Japanese-made Carina Es will start to go on sale from May and prices are
likely to be in the Pounds 11,500-16,000 range. An estate version is in the
pipeline.
Another Japanese world debutant at Geneva is the Honda CRX. This is not just
a Civic-derived sporting hatchback but a completely new vehicle that seems
bound to make its mark in the niche market for open-top fun cars.
Honda says that the CRX is not a backward glance at open sports cars of
bygone days (a dig at the Mazda MX-5) but a technically-innovative package,
although the running gear comes from the latest Civic. Buyers can have
1.6-litre engines of 125 or 160 horsepower, five-speed manual gears or a
four-speed automatic.
The CRX's rigid roof panel lifts off and stows under the boot lid - power
operation will be an optional extra - and the rear window retracts
electrically into a well. It reaches Britain in June, where it is expected
to cost about Pounds 16,000 upwards. By that time, Honda's glamorous new
Prelude 2+2 coupe, seen first at the Tokyo show last October, will have been
on sale in the UK for some weeks.
The 2.2-litre, 160-horsepower Prelude, with electronic four-wheel steering,
handled brilliantly when I tried it on the serpentine minor roads of Spain's
Costa Brava last month. British prices will be Pounds 16,495 for the 2.0,
which has ABS brakes but conventional steering; and Pounds 18,950 for the
4WS, 2.2-litre model which - like the 160 bhp CRX - comes with a driver's
side airbag.
Mazda, which of late has made a speciality of filling market niches with
entertaining cars like the MX-5, MX-3 and, more recently, the MX-6, has
pulled yet another one out of the hat for Geneva. The Xedos 6 (Xedos is the
name by which the poshest Mazda models will be known in future) is pitched
at the sporty saloon sector dominated by BMW, Alfa Romeo, Audi and Lancia.
Britain will have it from early summer with a choice of engines: either a
two-litre, quad-cam V6 or a twin-cam, 1.6-litre, in-line four-cylinder. Like
so many of the latest Japanese cars, the Xedos combines curvaciousness with
good aerodynamics and is almost austerely undecorated.
Although the Japanese makers' presence at Geneva has never been stronger,
European and US makers are not letting them have it all their own way.
Renault is unveiling its Safrane executive-class car to replace the 25.
Although by no means a bad car, the 25 never sold well in Britain; but it
was very popular in France with business motorists and taxi operators who
could not afford a Mercedes.
The Safrane has cross-mounted V6 or in-line four-cylinder engines,
power-adjustable rear seats, and a hard-to-steal CD hi-fi system with remote
control that eventually will be combined with a hands-free mobile telephone.
It comes to Britain in August.
Alfa Romeo is showing the new, front-wheel drive 155, which has some
similarities with the Lancia Dedra under the sheet metal but uses Alfa's own
two-litre Twin Spark four-cylinder engine or a 2.5-litre V6. British sales
start early in summer and a 1.8 Twin Spark joins the range toward the end of
the year.
BMW unveils its new three-litre (218-horsepower) and four-litre (287 bhp) V8
engines. They will start to replace its veteran but silky-smooth in-line
sixes, initially in the 7-Series and then the 5-Series. Citroen's stand
features the first of the ZX models with automatic transmission.
No Geneva salon is complete without novelties, and two eye-catchers are
shown by General Motors. 'Ultralite' is a high-efficiency concept car with -
pedestrians and cyclists beware  - entire body sides opening as a pair of
gull-winged doors.
GM's Opel 'Twin' is a super-mini with interchangeable electric motors and
petrol engines. A rear-mounted drive module contains either a 34-horsepower,
three-cylinder engine or a pair of 14-horsepower electric motors, both with
a transmission and either a petrol tank or battery pack.
The idea is that when internal combustion-engined cars are banned from city
centres, you drive to a GM dealer. He whips out the petrol engine module and
replaces it with a battery-electric - 'just like that,' as the late comedian
Tommy Cooper would have said. And when you leave town to drive home, he
changes it back again. All you do is pay a rental charge.
GM says its engineers have achieved an average 106 mpg (2.66 l/100 km)
consumption with the 800 cc, three-cylinder engine matched with a six-speed
automatic transmission. As a battery car, it is said to use only 11.5
kilowatt-hours of energy every 100 km (62 miles). The show exhibit is not a
runner but GM plans to build one if public response justifies.
Ford's Ghia Connecta electric car uses technology from the Ecostar delivery
van. A fleet of 100 Ecostars goes into experimental service with customers
in Britain and the US next year.
It is, however, hard to see interesting concepts like the Connecta - even
more so, the GM Twin - ever getting beyond the prototype stage unless two
things happen. High-efficiency batteries must become much cheaper and the
law must allow only zero-pollution cars in urban areas.

FT  07 MAR 92 / How To Spend It: When the cat sat on the fax - The message
on the growing feline menace to warm, whirring machines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE service engineer looked closely at the facsimile machine before gazing
intently around the room. 'Where's the cat, then?' he demanded.
He had called in response to my faxed request for service and had instantly
diagnosed my trouble from the order letter, covered with myriad tiny black
spots and criss-crossed with fine short strokes. The spots were grit from my
cat's fur; the little fine lines were her hairs.
All over Britain, it seems, cats are creating havoc on faxes and the number
increases weekly.
I was the third service call that morning resulting from damage to fax
machines on which cats had lain, shedding fur and dirt.
At that point Flirt, my cat, entered, stared with annoyance at the engineer
and the dismembered fax machine and stalked out in characteristic feline
dudgeon.
'It is a very widespread problem and nobody ever thinks about it until the
faxes become messy, even illegible,' said my engineer.
Cats seek out and sit on faxes, revelling in the consistent warmth. Flirt
will often lie as though hugging the machine on which I have long since put
a plastic cover plus a fabric cover. That is fine when I am here because,
when the fax phone rings, I can remove Flirt, covers and all while,
replacing the irritated animal when the faxing stops.
When I am not at home, well, the fax is basically out of commission unless
the door to that room is locked. In which case Flirt vents her frustration
on the wallpaper in the hall, now in ribbons at the height of her
out-stretched forepaws. Then she lies, resignedly, under a radiator. But,
come summer and no radiators?
My engineer had just come from an open-plan office, shared as a London
headquarters by a clutch of small-business entrepreneurs who mostly worked
from their homes. The office has a resident cat, some 14 years old, who sits
on the fax. Nothing comes through except in screwed-up bits and pieces
unless someone is present to keep the cat away. Some papers had got stuck in
the works and the engineer had been clearing for some time. Nobody has the
heart to exile the cat after all this time.
A graphic artist in Kennington, London, lives, sleeps, eats and works in one
large open-plan studio, no doors except to bathroom and loo. His cat steps
off the fax when something is coming through, stands resignedly by the
machine until the faxing ends, and steps back on to the fax when it is
still. Fur and grit have filled the unreachable parts of the machine and the
artist is now clearing space on a wardrobe shelf for the fax.
A managing director, whose home office has French windows on to the garden,
has to have them closed to keep the cat off his fax the family will not hear
of locking up the cat so he can enjoy his garden while working at home.
My own engineer suggested I allow Flirt to lie, as she once was wont to do,
on my cable TV box because it is sufficiently sealed not to suffer. However,
that does not work because, every time she rises to change her position she
also changes the channel as she steps on the keys. A friend and I once
settled down to watch a film preprogrammed for VCR recording in my absence.
Our recording turned out to be a real mixture of flashes of horror, drama,
romance, and sport as a result of Flirt's walkabouts on the cable box.
The VCR is protected from Flirt by some creative ironmongery that keeps her
off while allowing ventilation to the VCR.
I have solved the problem. I remember, long ago, staying with the late Billy
Butlin, at his luxury home near Ascot.
Rows with his Welsh gardener had culminated in Taffy's stamping off,
swearing never to return unless Bill fenced in the acreage dedicated to his
beloved tropical birds, who flitted in trees to which heaters had been wired
while herons waded in a specially-bulldozed lake. Taffy's problem was that
the birds had eaten all the young bedding plants in the small, decorative
garden near the house. Bill promised that the garden would be suitably
fenced for Taffy and his spring planting.
He kept his promise. Taffy came back expecting to see the large acreage of
bird sanctuary expensively fenced in. But no. The small garden was fenced in
while the birds continued to enjoy freedom.
So I have 'fenced in' my fax. Finding no suitable, ventilated protective
covers, I bought from my vet a white-painted aluminium cat-carrying cage in
which the fax now lives (the hinged top having been removed until again
needed). Suitable justice until an ingenious manufacturer starts producing
anti-cat cages for fax machines.
And Flirt? She lies on a thin cushion-against the back of the cage where
some heat still emerges. She does not like it too much and rushes on to the
machine every time the cage is removed. But she is resigned to it now.

FT  07 MAR 92 / As They Say In Europe: Machiavelli and the Mafia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAKESPEARE used Italy for his comedies because it provided a suitable
backdrop for improbable events. But the present election campaign there
attracts comment only insofar as it concerns the central figures of
politica-spettacolo: pornographers, striptease artistes and the pneumatic
descendants of dead dictators.
The world ignores stories such as the decision by Rino Formica, the finance
minister, to offer Neapolitan cigarette smugglers new employment in the
civil service. 'If we can find jobs for 20,000 Albanians, we can surely do
the same for 25,000 smugglers,' he said.
Last autumn the government launched a campaign against the 'blondes,' the
smugglers of light tobacco cigarettes. La Repubblica of Rome reported that
the blondes wrote to Formica in these terms: 'Dear minister: if you take our
cigarette market away from us, we shall be forced to steal. Signed: the
Smugglers of San Giovanni a Teduccio, Naples.'
The minister's offer to buythe merchants' speedboats and give them jobs led
Corriere della Sera to do what Italian papers always do: ask a sociologist.
One, Amato Lamberti, described as an 'observer' of the Mafia, said the
proposal touched on an important question: 'the need to differentiate
between criminals and those who are compelled to make a living by illegal
means.'
In Italy, sociologists and psychiatrists play the role of court jesters as
we shall see.
Repubblica objected. It said that the minister's ideas were 'in line with
the juridical culture and moral philosophy which our secular government
exudes: when a phenomenon is out of control, the system absorbs and
metabolises it. You don't want to stand up to Mafia terrorism? Pardon the
penitents and peace is won. You don't want to try to wipe out tax evasion?
Total forgiveness and you're friends again.'
It said the smugglers could double as border guards - a suggestion for which
there was a precedent in Italian history.
Another big story was about a gentleman from Verona who battered his parents
to death with a frying pan to get hold of their fortune. He received a
30-year sentence, which means 14 at most, and a share in the inheritance.
Psychiatrists at his trial said the accused was a victim of the materialist
culture typical of rich places like Verona. He received letters of support
from many young heirs around the country.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung tried to come to terms with other aspects
of Italy's moral universe while pursuing its own, turgid, geopolitical
speculation. Heinz-Joachim Fischer wrote an editorial entitled 'The unloved
Germans' (a headline that has appeared a couple of hundred times this year.)
He wondered whether Germany should run its foreign policy according to the
categorical imperative of Immanuel Kant, the Prussian philosopher, or the
'sly counsel' of Macchiavelli.
Fischer argued that every other nation conducted its policy towards Germany
with a copy of Macchiavelli in its metaphorical hand. 'They accept in all
innocence that their interests are self-evident principles . . . they
organise their policy towards Germany on the basis of what is useful for
them. From them and their masters, we can learn.
'Thus, the Italians have a special role vis-a-vis the Germans among European
nations. They have no foreign policy principles, wanting only to live in
peace and enjoy a few pleasures. While France pursues national glory and
England strives to counterbalance any overweening power on the Continent,
the Italians have no power-political or racial-psychological preconceptions
 -except those which they cook up for their own purposes.'
Italy is the one European nation with a reputation unchanged for 700 years.
Dante said it was a 'Lady, no longer of fair provinces, but of a brothel
house impure.' Shakespeare's contemporary, Sir Henry Wotton, said: 'A
paradise inhabited with devils.' Dr Johnson completed the picture: 'A man
who has not been in Italy is always conscious of an inferiority.' Specially
if he never meets Rino Formica.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Warm Welsh wool for real beds: Colourful classics produced
by small weavers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REAL BEDS are back. Throw away the duvet. Forget the polyester pillow. Get
out the feather bolster and the Welsh wool blankets for really snug nights
between the sheets.
The homespun look is here again. People are once more turning to natural
handmade products for the bedroom as well as the rest of the home.
This should prove good news for a wet and windy corner of west Wales,
Pembrokeshire, the old county name for the south west corner of Dyfed.
There, in the last century, the only industrialised craft activity was
weaving. Hundreds of little woollen mills were scattered around the county
but, sadly, only a handful remain. Those that do are still turning out
quality goods made to last.
Using traditional materials some are recreating the kind of blankets,
bedspreads and eiderdowns that kept great granny warm at night. For those
who like their natural fabrics given an up-to-date look there are plenty of
other craftspeople turning out quilts, sheets, rugs and wallhangings with
original and modern designs.
For traditional Welsh woollen products a favourite place of mine is Melin
Tregwynt, near Castlemorris, Haverford- west, Dyfed (tel. 03485-644/285 or
fax 03485-694). This picturesque working mill, operated by the Griffiths
family since 1912, weaves 100 per cent pure new wool for furnishing and
fabrics.
Their 'from the wood' range of bedspreads and blankets comes in wonderful
colours and patterns - wood- smoke, ember, spruce and forest berry. The
textures and styles evoke the smell of autumn, the first nip of frost . . .
and the need for an extra covering on the bed.
Most mills have their own designs and Tregwynt is no exception. One example
is a bedspread with a simplified St David's cross pattern for Pounds 79 -
pure wool and machine washable.
Tregwynt's work is the complete antithesis of the throwaway society. Amanda
Griffiths, wife of Eifion whose grandfather founded the business, told me:
'Our products certainly wear well. We have a chequerboard cloth on our table
at home going back 200 years.'
She is anxious to stress that although the company is not really fashion
conscious it does keep up with new colours and themes and brings out a new
collection at least once a year.
The company does bespoke work - for example it has completed an order of 30
items for a small hotel - and is hoping a new computer-aided facility will
enable it to go in for more complex patterns. A fringed doubleweave
bedspread is based on an early 19th century original and is available in
indigo and claret.
It is the memory of how bedspreads and blankets ought to be that has
inspired the company's latest Cofion range. Blankets come in a choice of
simple designs all finished with traditional stitching. Pram blankets start
from Pounds 11.50 up to king size at Pounds 90. Bedspreads range from Pounds
75 for a single to Pounds 105 for king size. In London, Liberty, Conran and
the General Trading Company take a limited range of Tregwynt products.
Not far from Tregwynt, at Ambleston, David and Margaret Redpath run the 200
year-old Wallis Woollen Mill. They specialise in organic dyes and have even
grown an indigo crop on their Welsh site.
Their most recent commissions have been yarn for a carpet at Spencer House,
London, now being woven in Turkey, and a priest's cope, stoles and altar
pieces for an Oxford church.
The Redpaths produce dyed wool for everything from carpet repair yarns to
rugs, blankets and clothing fabric. Their embroidery wool, in more than 70
shades, is spun from fine worsted of 100 per cent lambswool.
The dyes used have good fastness to light and washing. Madder (red) indigo
(blue) and weld (yellow), the three great historical dyes, are the main
sources of colour. Colours can be dyed to order.
It is quite hard to describe the special quality of organic dyes. Apart from
the ecological value there is a subtle and harmonious depth and variety of
colour that is that bit superior to its chemical counterpart.
As specialist weavers and dyers the Redpaths are interested in individual
commissions and can be contacted at Renaissance Embroidery, Wallis Woollen
Mill, Ambleston, Haverfordwest, SA62 5RA (tel. and fax 0437-731-297).
For Pounds 1.50 the Redpaths will send Weekend FT readers a colour
photograph of their embroidery yarns, full details and a sample skein.
A few miles further west, near the coast at Solva, Middle Mill specialises
in floor rugs and carpets. There, the Grime family, Robert, Cynthia and son
Thomas, provide a very individual service.
'People send us their wallpaper and we weave a rug or carpet sample and send
it to them,' says Cynthia.
Their robust floor coverings are proving popular with locals and abroad  -
some 10 per cent of the mill's output is exported. It is the homely, solid,
hand-finished look to the products which is proving popular in the US. I
particularly liked a range of rugs based on the traditional Welsh trellis
pattern.
Pricing is relatively modest; stair carpet sells at Pounds 8.15 per yard for
a 27in width and Pounds 10.75 for 36in. Double weave carpet sells at Pounds
11.75 a square yard. Widths can be varied to suit the individual.
The mill offers a full postal service so write to: The Woollen Mill, Middle
Mill, Solva, Haverfordwest, SA62 6XD (tel. 0437-721-597; evenings are the
best time). Orders take from one to three months to process depending on the
individual requirement.
For further details of craft workshops in Pembrokeshire and other weavers in
the wider area of Dyfed a booklet entitled Dyfed Craft Trails is available
from the Wales Tourist Board, Davis Street, Cardiff, CF1 2FU (tel.
0222-475-226).

FT  07 MAR 92 / How To Spend It: The alternatives to nanny - The pluses,
minuses and costs of different kinds of baby care
</HEADLINE>

THE RECENT incident of the two British babies who were seriously injured by
a bogus nanny underlines the fact that you cannot be too careful whom you
choose to look after your children. However, the recession in the UK has
forced many working parents to economise on childcare.
Qualified, experienced nannies are a costly luxury, and many parents are
looking at cheaper options, such as day nurseries, childminders, mother's
helps and au-pairs. But are they as good?
The great thing about au-pairs is that you can ask them to do anything in
the house while you enjoy yourself with the children; with trained nannies,
it is the opposite. But how much can you trust an au-pair to do? Should you
leave your children with one?
Agencies report that more and more employers are leaving au-pairs in charge
of their children every day while they work. 'They can be great as another
pair of hands,' says Jilly Davis, of the Complete Nanny Agency, 'but the
reality is that many are unable to cope in an emergency.'
Her view, which seems sensible, is that most au-pairs are not ideal as
full-time sole carers for small children.
The main problem with au-pairs is that frequently their English is not very
good. After all, many become au-pairs in order to learn English, although
many are often keen merely to see England (London in particular) and to get
away from home. Apart from the difficulties and potential misunderstandings
which may arise (ours cooked a Waldorf salad last week), it can be hard for
them to communicate well with children of talking age.
Another drawback is that few have much experience of looking after children.
The other evening, the 18-year-old au-pair of a friend gaily gave a
two-year-old a boiled sweet and then laughed innocently as he choked on it.
But au-pairs are still the cheapest form of domestic help you can find -
although remember that you will have to feed them. Our German au-pair has a
healthy appetite, but other nationalities are apparently more frugal. The
minimum wage is Pounds 25 a week, but the standard wage seems to be around
Pounds 35 for a 30-hour week and two evenings babysitting - a bargain
considering that many babysitters charge Pounds 3.50 an hour.
The typical au-pair will - naturally, perhaps  - not be totally devoted to
her work and her main priority is having a good time. This at least means
that she is unlikely to mooch around your home like a lost soul, getting in
the way, but unless you are quite strict, you may find her wandering in with
the milk each morning bringing home a new boyfriend.
In theory, an au-pair is a greater responsibility than a nanny because she
is supposed to be treated as part of the family, so you may find yourself
lying awake and worrying that her 18-stone excitable Latin papa will come
over and take you to task if she elopes with her boyfriend. However, many
au-pairs are students, so they are often bright and interesting. Having an
au-pair can be a good chance to learn a foreign language, too.
A mother's help should also be prepared to help in the house and may be an
ideal carer for children who are at play school for part of the day, or in
families where mothers do not work or work part time. Jilly Davis says:
'Literally, mother's helps are girls who aspire to be nannies but have not
got into nanny colleges, or are those who took up working with children when
they were older.'
As such, they are cheaper than qualified nannies; salaries start at Pounds
80 a week (live-in), rising to Pounds 100 or more with experience. A
recently qualified nanny will cost between Pounds 130 and Pounds 200 a week,
live out, and between Pounds 90 and Pounds 150 living in. Wages may be
higher in parts of central London.
Many mother's helps are devoted to children but others are doing the job
simply because they do not know what else to do. And, as Davies says: 'They
are often very happy for a year working a a reduced salary until they find
friends who are nannies who are earning more.'
If you dislike the idea, or do not have the room for live-in help, and you
are organised enough to get yourself and all the clutter your child needs
for the day - plus the child  - a child-minder or nursery might be a better
option.
Childminders are usually mothers themselves, and, unlike nannies or mother's
helps, they tend to stay in one place because they are rooted to their jobs
and homes by their families. They are more likely to be flexible if you are
late home than staff at a day nursery, and while few childminders are
formally trained, they should be registered with the local social services.
Average hourly rates are Pounds 1.30 for up to 50 hours a week, although pay
varies from borough to borough.
You must be absolutely certain, however, that the childminder's house is
suitable for small children. One mother found out that the toys which were
out when she first came to interview the childminder had been borrowed just
for the occasion. A social services supervisor told me she often had to
remind childminders about locks which an inquisitive child could open or
about other potential dangers in the home.
'Child-minders are great for babies and toddlers,' says Caroline Thomas, a
civil servant, whose daughter Chloe went to one until she was two. However,
Thomas felt it was difficult for a childminder looking after several
children to provide the attention and intellectual stimulation for older
children, and that she would invariably comfort her own child first.
The greatest advantage of nurseries is that staff should be highly trained
and the facilities are often excellent. 'The best thing was that the staff
only had to look after the children - they didn't have to cook, shop, clean
or do anything else like most mothers or nannies, ' says a former nursery
mother convinced her child gained from being with other children.
But you would be stuck every time your child is ill, which may be a least
once a month. Most nurseries cannot cater for sick children, so you are
called out to collect your ailing child, leaving an important meeting, only
to discover when you reach home that little Horace has staged a remarkable
recovery. Day nurseries are also wonderful germ exchanges, where babies
catch everything and then give it to their parents in more severe form.
But the greatest drawback with a day nursery - unless it is near your home -
is travelling with a small child. My idea of a living nightmare would be
taking a tired toddler in the rush hour every day on the Underground across
London, and probably the rest of the carriage's, too.
When employers subsidise the cost of a nursery place, these drawbacks are
probably unimportant. But unsubsidised places are not cheap: in Nottingham,
for example, one will cost Pounds 60 upwards for a week, in London Pounds
120 to Pounds 130. Places are scarce; those in free local authority
nurseries tend to go to children with special needs.
An alternative to a childminder or a nursery may be a nanny-share with
another family. Juliet Rix, a freelance broadcaster, is enthusiastic about
this arrangement. The key thing, she says, is to be in at the beginning to
set your terms to the other family as well as the nanny.
Put more bluntly, nanny-shares can often work better for one family than the
other. If the other family offers juicier perks, such as a better car, you
quickly become the poor and less attractive employer. It is bad enough
arranging your holidays to coincide with the nanny's (yes, it is usually
that way round) without having to worry about the other family as well. If
the nanny is looking after two children from two families together, it is
usual to pay a little over the usual hourly rate. Do not consider sharing a
nanny if you are not a good negotiator and skilled diplomat.
Ultimately, the kind of childcare you look for will depend on what you can
afford and what you need. Few solutions are perfect, but most are better
than nothing for tired, harassed mothers - providing your children are in
safe hands and are happy, of course.
The key point, as the precocious 11-year-old daughter of a friend told me
is: 'It just depends on the person.'

FT  07 MAR 92 / Wine: Angela checks the cheap but cheerful - A unique
exporter from Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRITISH wine merchant arrived to buy wine at a large French winery. The
staff lolled around smoking. The welcome was offhand. The merchant was
underwhelmed. Until he mentioned who had sent him.
Gitanes were hurriedly stubbed out, the workers set to like the busiest of
bees and a superior echelon of eager management appeared as if by magic. The
name capable of galvanising entire workforces in the very unBritish world of
wine production is Angela Muir.
Muir is a 43-year-old Master of Wine with a very unusual interest, cheap
wine. 'What really fascinates me,' she says, dark eyebrows knit passionately
under her Valkyrie mane, 'is large volumes of low cost wine that people get
physical pleasure from - and that doesn't happen often enough.'
Uniquely, she has built up a reputation for telling wine producers in the
hugely important bottom third of the wine price pyramid, in no uncertain
terms, how to make wines that (British) people will actually want to drink.
'I start at the critic's end rather than the creator's,' is how she explains
her particular expertise. 'If you happen to have great land, then employing
a genius to make great wine is just a question of money. What I'm interested
in is working back towards what the consumer wants rather than what the soil
will give and how best to express it.'
Happily for her the British market is so important, and indicative, to the
world's potential wine exporters that, in the first three weeks of last
month, she had been to Argentina to help one of the biggest companies there
fashion wines for foreign palates with less than ideal equipment (answer:
bottle in France); to Chile to find a new source for a British company which
may then ask her to source its entire New World range 'very exciting, in an
area of the market I really like'; to Czechoslovakia to oversee one of her
most innovative schemes to date; to France on a confidential assignment (it
is a very competitive market); and finally, and apparently most thrillingly,
to an Italian manufacturer of bottling equipment. Angela's eyes light up
when describing this visit. 'They're very, very good, particularly on
computer coordination of bottling lines. We went and had a very interesting
look round their machine shops near Verona on the way back from
Czechoslovakia.'
The Czech project is the first one in which Cellarworld, the company she
formed in 1988 with her ex-management accountant husband Peter, has taken a
direct stake. It all started during her previous 10-year stint buying wine -
'proactively, like the Oddbins boys'  - for Allied-Lyons where she was most
famous for dragging a huge Spanish bodega into the late 20th century by
promising to buy the resulting crisp 1982 white revamp for the Don Cortez
label. Her unrivalled buying power at Grants of St James's was, of course,
why producers listened to her didactic comments on their wines.)
The road to Czechoslovakia went via Ethiopia. Someone, 'it's always silly -
a friend of a friend, or someone wanting a reciprocal deal,' asked Angela to
evaluate some Ethiopian wines. The wines stayed in Ethiopia but 18 months
ago she was asked by a related contact to look at a range of wines from a
Czechoslovakia desperate for trade with the west. 'Despite the ghastly
labels, and some unpleasant winemaking aromas of sorbates etcetera, I
realised there was some very good intense fruit there. I said I'd write them
a report if they'd pay for me to go and spend four days there. You can learn
a lot in four days if you really decide to get to grips with it.'
Yes, ma'am. Or rather, yes, Major General, to which rank Angela has been
elevated by colleagues at the Slovakian wineries from which she has coaxed
four remarkably clean, fresh westernised varietals that are just hitting the
shelves of better Victoria Wine shops at under Pounds 3 a bottle.
The lively red Frankovka at Pounds 2.79 is in limited distribution but is
particularly good value. If the first three days' sales are indicative, she
may turn out to be the saviour of the Czech wine industry, which is about
half the size of the long-westernised Bulgarian one.
The Muir Czech revolution encompassed such refinements as an awesome respect
for hygiene, a proper understanding of filtration, sterile bottling, more
use of under-utilised equipment and whirlwind labelling applications to
Brussels. Bottling lines have already been upgraded to supermarket standard.
She also had to make changes in the tasting and dining rooms. 'I told them
we needed proper big tasting glasses, not thimbles. Also that we needed
something to spit into - and that we certainly didn't need cat stew.'
The Muirs live, with their cats, in deepest Surrey. Peter Muir is clearly
vital to the business and, like many palates exposed to wine through a
partner, is an impressive blind taster. His wife views the fine wine market
as a 'minor interest' and the wine she chooses to drink is, typically, fizzy
and copious.
If she is right about the future of the wine market there will be a need for
more consumer-driven consultants of her ilk. 'Wine will be used more and
more as a luxury and it's going to be one hell of a struggle for survival by
vineyard owners. The market will increasingly demand reasonable prices and
that wine tastes nice. There is lots of trauma ahead for producers who can't
make that adjustment.'
Cellarworld operates from the same address as the Fulham Road Wine Centre,
899/900 Fulham Road, London, SW6. Tel: 071-384 2588.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Where have all the roubles gone?: The second siege of
Leningrad-St Petersburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACK CHISHOLM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERESTROIKA began as a quiet revolution and turned into an undeclared war,
the war of Russian society in transition. It is a battle of individual
struggles for a 'normal life,' fought in city streets and in markets, in
shops and in the countryside.
It is a conflict in which the strong claw their way upward and the weak go
to the wall. Take, for example, my friend the general. Five years ago, when
red flags fluttered proudly over the Leningrad Soviet and party headquarters
at Smolni, he was at the height of his powers.
You would see his car escorted through the city streets. There were aides,
power, influence. Members of the nomenklatura gathered at his apartment or
government dacha for elaborate banquets or discreet suppers. I knew many of
the guests and knew, too, that many were corrupt. I shed no tears for them
now. The general was different. I have seldom met a man so honest and we
became friends.
Now in retirement, he is one of 'yesterday's men,' desperately worried about
the future of his young son who begins school this year. His monthly R620
rouble pension is insufficient for bare necessities and what work is there
in contemporary Russia for retired generals? They are two a penny, like the
grand dukes who drove Parisian taxis.
His wife is working through her modest wardrobe, selling clothes she can do
without in commercial shops and buying food with the proceeds. The general
goes to market, taking vodka bought with his monthly ration card, trading
the precious bottle for a kilo of meat. He drives a decrepit, ten-year-old
car and picks up fare-paying passengers to pay the petrol. If car, fridge or
freezer break down, there is money for repairs.
Someone comes to the door to ask whether the couple have a young child,
returning shortly afterwards with a welcome German aid package. My friends
laugh when they see the parcel has been rifled, the coffee and chocolate
removed. 'It is probably on sale down the road. Never mind, we can use the
rest.'
It is hard not to feel embarrassment when old friends are so happy with so
little; a few packets of flour, pasta, margarine, muesli and sausages. The
general is strong and still healthy. He wants to work but plans have come to
nothing and he retains his pride. 'I was offered a job as master carpenter
in the gulag. You understand why I could not take it, don't you?'
When the (Great Patriotic) war broke out in 1941 Svetlana was 18 and living
on the Polish border. For months she walked east, several thousand miles to
safety across the Urals, then fate brought her back to factory work in
Leningrad and the famous 900-day siege. Now nearly 70, and looking much
older, she supplements her meagre pension in a restaurant cloakroom. Her
face twists into a bitter smile as she contrasts the war years with
contemporary St Petersburg.
'During the Blockade there was nothing but hope. Then, we worked together
for common goals. Now we are divided, people think only of themselves. It is
worse, much worse, for even hope has gone.' Had she seen any western aid?
'No, though I would not be ashamed to take it, even from the Germans.'
Many residents share her gloomy outlook, trudging wearily through the slush
on futile searches for food they can afford. A large state grocery had
cabbage, onions, beets, withered apples and unidentifiable root vegetables.
No potatoes. The nearby butchers had meat (largely bone) at R80 (40p) a kilo
and fatty sausage for R90.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Bass - still ale and hearty: The roots of a brewing giant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW THE image of British beer has changed in just one generation. Take the
monster brewer Bass Charrington. Today, its empire is built on lagers such
as Carling Black Label and Tennents: bright beers swilled with such relish
up and down the land that Bass makes over an annual cheque to the Excise in
excess of Pounds 695m.
Touring the ultra-modern brewery in Burton-on-Trent, cheerful executives
shower you with record-beating statistics: gigantic profits, heroic
consumption, epic production rates. It takes a certain sort of mind to take
it all in. For me, it meant only an awful lot of beer. But there is more
than one face to Bass, and not all the traditions of my childhood and
adolescence have been laid to rest.
On the northern edge of the great sprawl of Birmingham, I visited the
Highgate Brewery in Walsall. In the summer of 1939, redundancy notices were
drawn-up for the dozen-odd staff in what was, and is, a less-than-economic
proposition. Then, there was that business over in Poland. Now, more than 50
years later, the men are still there.
Highgate is famed for mild beer and, every now and then, an autumn strong
ale called Highgate Old. Good Midland mild like Highgate is virtually
unknown in the south, although the White Horse pub on Parson's Green, in
west London, takes a regular delivery.
The deep colour and strong 'chocolatey' flavour derive from the black malt
which is added to the more usual pale and crystal malt. Munched in the raw,
black malt tastes of coffee and burnt toast. Another factor is the famous
'soft' well water. The brewery manager compared the taste to blood, which
led me to speculate on his movements at full moon. For those less accustomed
to blood, the taste is reminiscent of iron. Fuggles hops complete the
package. There are no pellets here: Highgate Mild is the purest 'real' ale.
The pretty little brewery was built in the closing years of last century and
forms a stark contrast to Bass's largest plant in the beer city of
Burton-on-Trent. The need for efficiency has meant that the place has been
knocked-about a bit but, underneath the 30-acre site, Bass brewing began: a
comparatively modest venture founded in 1777.
It was the well water that drew Bass to Burton although, in the high Middle
Ages, the monks of Burton Abbey had known the secret of the gypsum deposits
in the soil and their suitability for brewing a distinctive, reddish-brown
ale.
In the second half of the 18th century, the need for Baltic timber made the
fortune of the port of Kingston-upon-Hull. Beer from Burton was shipped out
as ballast on fleets bound for Konigsberg, Riga and St Petersburg.
By the time the French Revolution broke out, the beer had grown so famous
that there was a tavern in Paris's Palais Royal dispensing Burton ale to the
budding politicians of the National Assembly.
War with France and the continental blockade put a temporary end to this
lucrative trade. Bass looked east along the Trent and Mersey Canal to
Liverpool and, from there, to India: thus, India Pale Ale was born.
Its success drew others to Burton and, by the end of last century, several
dozen breweries were exploiting the wells, inhabiting gaunt Victorian
buildings arranged around the railway sidings and ready to ship their brews
right round the world. With the mergers and closures of this century, just
three remain.
Cask-conditioned draught Bass is brewed only in Burton. It is the descendant
of that original beer which made the Bass fortunes. The water has changed,
though: intensive farming and nitrate fertlizers have meant that it needs to
be purified and the minerals added back. The brewery boffins concede that it
is now possible to make Burton beer just about anywhere.
The draught ale is still the brewer's favourite and great care is taken to
ensure that each cask leaving Burton is up to scratch when it reaches the
pub. At the end of my tour, I was treated to a delicately hoppy glass of it.
As I sipped, I noticed another old friend on the shelf behind the bar:
Worthington White Shield. a familiar face I had all but forgotten.
With its addition of yeasts in the bottle, White Shield must virtually be
unique in Britain, although the style lives on in Belgium and Germany. White
Shield is made in the Burton style, but this last bottled beer is now
produced elsewhere. As a relic of our beer-drinking past, it deserves to be
known better.
The Bass Museum can be visited in Horninglow Street, Burton-on-Trent (tel.
0283-42031). Open daily except Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day.
Last admission 4 pm.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Cookery: Oranges: the tasty way to start the day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COUNTRY house hotel where I stayed recently put fresh flowers and fruit in
the bedrooms but made me get out of the bath to accept delivery of a
breakfast tray at the door.
This unthinking service left me in a poor humour, and my mood took a turn
for the worse when I tasted the orange juice - low-grade stuff from a carton
instead of the freshly-squeezed product you would expect in an establishment
where bed and breakfast costs a cool Pounds 135.
Good mornings begin with good orange juice, and this is the time of year to
enjoy the very best. There is nothing quite like blood oranges to start the
day. Their juice is deliciously astringent but not too tart. It rivals the
vivid colour of bortsch, and a draught is just as invigorating as a Bloody
Mary in its way. But there is more to blood oranges than just drinking their
juice. Used in place of ordinary sweet oranges, the moro and the tarocco
make a sensational sorbet, especially when spiked with a sprig of rosemary.
I am more than mildly addicted to wedges of unpeeled blood orange threaded
onto skewers with bay leaves, brushed with olive oil and grilled until hot
and slightly toffeed. (Take care not to burn them to a cinder). To make a
meal of this, use the caramelised oranges to partner spit-roasted small
birds served on rounds of grilled or fried polenta. Or simply add chicken
livers to the skewers.
I have recently had some success with the following appetiser, and I rate
blood oranges a valuable flavouring for couscous with quails.
SICILIAN SALAD (serves 4-6) Packed with crunch and exuberant flavours, this
should wake you up to spring.
Ingredients: 4 blood oranges; 2 bulbs of Florentine fennel; 2-3 oz young
spinach leaves or 1 small radicchio; 1 oz toasted pine nuts or slivered
almonds; a handful of black olives; two 2 oz cans of anchovy fillets; garlic
and fennel seed.
Method: Grate finely the oily zest from one of the oranges. Then cut the
skins off all four oranges, leaving no trace of pith clinging to the flesh.
Squeeze the juice from the trimmings adhering to the peel and mix it with
the orange zest, a small garlic clove and some fennel seeds crushed to a
paste with mortar and pestle. Stir-in the olive oil drained from one can of
anchovy fillets and season with salt to taste.
Dip the spinach leaves or radicchio into the dressing. Shake off excess and
arrange the leaves round the edge of a shallow dish. Slice the oranges. Trim
the fennel and cut it into thin wedges. Toss both ingredients in the
dressing and pile them into the centre of the leaves, scattering the olives
and toasted nuts here and there together with the anchovies from one can,
cut into snippets.
Arrange the anchovies from the second can, criss-cross fashion, over the top
and serve with slices of good country bread brushed with the oil from the
second can and toasted under the grill.
COUSCOUS WITH QUAIL (serves 4-5)
Fruity and spicy with the tang of mint and blood oranges, this is a
simplified version of a favourite Moroccan dish.
Ingredients: 8 quail (each one stuffed with a bay leaf and a short length of
cinnamon stick, and trussed);  1/2 lb couscous; 4 blood oranges; 1 large
onion and 1-2 garlic cloves; cumin seed; cinnamon; a small bunch of mint; 2
oz toasted pine nuts or slivered almonds; 2 oz sultanas;  1/2 lb each
carrots and broccoli; a 15 oz can of chick peas; 1 1/2 pt chicken stock; a
little olive oil.
Method: For the stew, first chop a large onion and soften it for a few
minutes in a little oil in a couscousier or other heavy stew pan. Add the
little birds and colour them all over.
Stir in the crushed garlic, a heaped teaspoon of crushed cumin, and a large
pinch of ground cinnamon. Add the stock and the juice and zest of two
oranges. Bring quickly to simmering point, cover, and cook gently for 15
minutes.
Add the sliced carrots and drained chick peas and simmer for about 10
minutes more. Then add the broccoli, broken into florets, bring back to
simmering point, switch off the heat and leave for five minutes to make the
greenery tender.
For the couscous (which should be prepared and cooked in tandem with the
stew), first aromatise the grain with the finely-grated zest of two oranges,
a heaped teaspoon of ground cumin, and a generous pinch of cinnamon.
Add the sultanas, the flesh of one orange cut into membrane-free segments,
the juice of the second orange, and a little cold salted water. Let the
grain soften and swell for 10 minutes or so, raking it occasionally with
your fingers to break up any lumps.
Then put the couscous into a steamer basket lined with butter muslin and
place it over the stew pan to cook. It will need 15 minutes or so to become
thoroughly hot and tender.
Enrich the cooked grain with a little warmed olive oil, the toasted nuts and
some salt. Arrange it in a nest-like ring on a serving dish. Spoon the
vegetables into the centre and sit the quail on top.
Serve with a sauce-boat of the cooking liquor, seasoned and laced with
chopped mint to make a fragrant gravy.

<TEXT>
BATTERED by the north Wales elements, the temperature in the great hall of
Plas Uchaf, a 15th century manor house, hovered just above freezing until
the electricity finally gave up the ghost, writes Tim Burt.
Manweb the electrician, summoned from Wrexham by Jones the caretaker,
restored the power after seven hours with a fuse the size of a shotgun
cartridge.
Clearly, he thought it amazing that people paid good money to shiver in a
building not much modernised since the 1400s. Then, as now, the centrepiece
of the heating system was a hearth large enough to spit-roast an ox. Today,
visitors huddle by the fire just as the Barons of Cymmer did several
centuries ago.
The barons earned a tidy sum living at Plas Uchaf, from where they are
thought to have taxed the local peasants and farmed the meadows in the Dee
valley. Since then their ancestral home has changed hands frequently:
housing farmers, tailors, gamekeepers and even hosting religious services
before falling into disrepair and neglect in the 1960s.
Now it is a moneyspinner again, for it is leased by the local council to the
Landmark Trust, the charity which rescues and restores historic buildings.
Plas Uchaf is one of 150 buildings saved by the trust, which rents
everything from castles to pigsties at rates up to Pounds 1,500 a week.
Plas Uchaf is a spectacular example. Unprepossessing from the outside, it
conceals a vaulted chamber with a unique hammer beam roof and weathered
aisle trusses. But like many of the trust's properties, preservation of the
old does not allow for modern conveniences such as central heating.
In winter, residents must be able to endure some fairly Arctic conditions in
exchange for a medieval atmosphere. In spring - presumably - it gets better.
The Landmark Trust, Shottesbrooke, Maidenhead, Berkshire, tel: 062-882-5925.
Plas Uchaf, sleeping five, costs from Pounds 192 per weekend to Pounds 555
per week in peak season.

ONE SHOULD not, as a rule, write articles about paradise hideaways, reports
Alan Friedman from New York. Write about such a place and before long it

in the first place.
Never mind. One's sense of duty to Weekend FT readers calls for full
disclosure of an unusual Caribbean retreat.
The Sandcastle, as its Chicago-born proprietor, Darryl Sanderson, is quick
to note, is not for everyone. It is a tiny hotel located on the pristine
White Bay beach of Jost Van Dyke, a four-mile-long island that is part of
the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and can be reached only by private yacht or
by taking the 20-minute ferry ride from Tortola, the capital of the BVI.
Arrival at Jost Van Dyke requires one to clamber into an inflatable dinghy
that covers the 30-ft distance to shore, where, trousers rolled high, one
leaps into the shallow water and ambles up the beach. From then on, formal
attire ranges from swimwear to shorts and T-shirts. Shoes are optional.
Sandcastle consists of four octangular wooden cottages, each with
double-bed, an assortment of bad novels and a bathroom, set amid the
hibiscus and palm trees that grow along a half-mile stretch of white coral
beach. With only four cottages and a staff of five, the service is not bad.
Nor is the food, which includes fresh flying fish, grouper and other local
fare plus a wine list that is quite respectable.
The cottages, which cost Dollars 295 (Pounds 168.50) a night for two, three
meals a day included, do not have electricity. Instead, one learns to work
propane burners and to make use of the sort of lavatory normally found on a
boat.
The principal activity at Sandcastle is - nothing. There are windsurfing
boards and snorkeling gear available, and scuba diving or day-sailing can be
arranged. But the best parts of this hideaway are the large hammocks strung
between palm trees on the beach, and the Soggy Dollar Bar, a little beach
area that is patronised by visiting yachtsmen who sail into the bay and drop
anchor.
The Soggy Dollar is a significant feature of Sandcastle, mainly because it
claims to be the birthplace of The Painkiller, a concoction of Pusser's Rum,
orange and pineapple juices, coconut cream and a smattering of grated
nutmeg. It is advisable to wait at least an hour after breakfast before
ordering your first Painkiller of the day. As the 85`F winter weather and a
gentle breeze persist throughout the day, Painkillers tend to distract you
from all manner of intended serious reading.
Sandcastle is comfortable enough, but not recommended unless you are
prepared for splendid isolation. If you want the ultimate in luxury, better
investigate Richard Branson's Necker Island, a more expensive neighbouring
member of the BVI chain.
If you simply wish to get far away from newspapers filled with endless
reports of BCCI, Boris Yeltsin and Robert Maxwell, try Sandcastle. It would
be best, however, to visit it within the next 12-18 months. Darryl Sanderson
says electricity may soon be installed, plus roads and telephones and all of
that.
Sandcastle has only one portable cellular phone, for emergencies. If you
want information, leave a message with Darryl Sanderson's answering service
on 0101-809-775-5262.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Travel: The pharaonic splendours of old Thailand - A gaudy
oriental opulence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THAILAND'S principal historic sites - some of them ruins, some of them
living temples - deserve to be seen. One of the most rewarding one-day
excursions out of Bangkok is a trip to Ayuddhya, the capital of ancient
Siam.
Although there are numerous tour companies that will coach you there and
back, the superior way is to do the return leg by boat along the Chao Phraya
river, by preference on the Oriental Queen I or the Oriental Queen II, owned
by the Oriental Hotel and equipped with guides from the World Travel
Service, the oldest, largest and most efficient of Bangkok's many tour
operators.
A genuinely lavish on-board buffet luncheon is served, and the cruise
includes an additional stop at Bang Pa-In: a 19th century summer palace
built by Rama V and Rama VI. Although its mixture of Thai, classical,
Italian, Chinese and even English buildings, reflecting the Chakri dynasty's
desire to propel Siam on to the world stage, is not entirely successful, it
has some pretty lakes that confer upon it the air of a tropical Marienbad.
Ayuddhya, by contrast, is where the Thai nation really took off. Seventy
kilometres to the north of Bangkok, it was built on an island chosen by its
founder, King Ramathibodi, for the leverage it gave him over the whole of
the Menam basin. That was in 1350, during the final eclipse of the Khmer
kingdom of Angkhor.
Unlike previous Thai princes, the rulers of Ayuddhya made no bones about
their pretentions to power. Carrying with them the full weight of Buddhist
ritual, they set themselves up as gods. Their subjects were expected always
to present their backs to them whenever they chose to leave the palace, and
audiences were conducted in an elaborate throne-hall in which the throne,
panoplied in gold, was raised many feet, so that the king appeared
mystically, as though floating on a cloud.
To enhance their divine status, the Ayuddhya kings developed a city to
match, in which palaces mingled promiscuously with temples, proclaiming the
true nature of the medieval polity. And it worked.
Always cosmopolitan, Ayuddhya in time became a genuinely international
inland port, a 'strong great city, seated upon an island round which flowed
a river three times the size of the Seine', as the Abbe de Choisy wrote in
the 17th century. 'There rode ships from France, England, Holland, China and
Japan, while innumerable boats and gilded barges rowed by 60 men plied to
and fro.'
Yet Ayuddhya was eventually strangled by its own pomp. As the Abbe also
observed, watching a royal procession, 'I feel that Pharaoh on the banks of
the Nile used to parade in the same splendour.' The kings became
progressively more remote from their subjects, and the kingdom was enfeebled
by scheming courtiers until, in 1767, the city was sacked by a Burmese army.
Ayuddhya was destroyed. The predominantly wooden buildings were burned to
the ground, while much of the stone of the palaces and temples was later
removed. Not very much remains. In the centre of the city three great
bell-shaped stupas, or chedi, still stand, joined in line like the
superstructure of some unfathomable alien battleship. These, along with
other stupas, are what visitors are taken to see.
Around the ruins of Ayuddhya a new, sprawling 20th century town is growing,
the effect of which does not entice. In marked contrast is the site of the
older city of Sukhothai, 450 kms north-west of Bangkok, the whole of which
has been preserved from encroachment. Again, not many of the buildings have
survived, but what has been created is an enormous and bewilderingly
peaceful park, with bicycles for hire at the main entrance.
Sukhothai's name means 'Dawn of Happiness.' In its time it was an important
city, and other cities near it were held in vassalage. But it was never more
than the centre of one kingdom among several in the Menam basin. Surviving
inscriptions also indicate a less stratified society than the one that
evolved at Ayuddhya. The kings, far from being demi-gods, were humans who
took an active role in the daily running of affairs, and at least one of
them held court in a sugar-plum grove, where, on the sabbath, Buddhist monks
intoned the Law.
An official and slightly lavish pictorial brochure tells the visitor that a
joint Thai-UNESCO restoration programme 'will protect a fine example of the
cultural heritage of all mankind.' That is propaganda, yet Sukhothai is
innately, if demurely, spectacular.
A model reconstruction shows that the medieval city, unlike too many of its
counterparts, was meticulously planned. Founded during the 13th century on
both sides of the Yom river, its triple rampart walls defined a rectangular
area measuring 2 kms by 1 1/2 , traversed in both directions by a grid of
roads and canals. Inside, as well as scores of temples and public buildings,
were foundries, kilns, lakes and granaries, as well as orchards and fields.
Under siege, Sukhothai was self-sufficient beyond the patience of most
hostile armies.
The model demonstrates the Thais' ability to plan to scale. On the site
itself, as at Ayuddhya, it is mainly the stupas that have survived, Hindu as
well as Buddhist, along with the bases and pillars of the prayer-halls and
ordination rooms, and, most dramatically, some arresting Buddha images.
These latter, either seated or standing, and relatively unscathed by the
ravages of time, stare impassively across and through the ruins, creating an
awesome visual poetry. Even so, the ruins themselves provide an equal
insight into Thai culture and the Thai mind. Although stonework abounds,
much of what survives is laterite, bricks made of small stones mixed with
clay which hardened in the sun. These structures were then covered with a
stucco made from sand, sugar-cane juice, water and even insects, producing
the receptive smooth surfaces onto which gold and other brilliant colours
could be applied.
It is precisely this, the penchant for brilliant surfaces, combined with
forms that are more feminine than those generally found in western
architecture and decoration, that defines the almost gaudy oriental opulence
that is synonymous with Thailand, and the continuity of its culture.
For while the stucco has largely vanished from Ayuddhya and Sukhothai, in
Bangkok itself it is wonderfully preserved, in the great buildings of the
old quarter: the Grand Palace, the Golden Mount and a dozen glittering
temples, among them Wat Po, Wat Phra Kaeo and Wat Benchamabophit.
Transport: Most major airlines fly to Bangkok. The national carrier, Thai
International, is recommended: as well as in-flight orchids, it offers a
range of packages and incentive schemes and a good network of domestic
flights. Bangkok Airways services Samui, Hua Hin and Phuket. In general,
roads are good and air-conditioned coaches preferable to the Thai railway
system.
Tour operators: Of Thailand's many tour companies, World Travel Service is
in a class of its own, both for group packages and individual itineraries.
Head office: 1053 Charoen Krung Road, Bangkok 10500. Tel: 233-5900.
Health: AIDS is endemic. Anti-malaria courses are advised for anyone
travelling outside the main cities. Before going, consult a doctor about
cholera, typhoid and polio, and insist he gives you a shot of gamma globulin
(anti-hepatitis).
Accommodation: London reps: Axis, tel: 071-706-2220; Mandarin Oriental,
071-537-2988; Shangri-La International, 081-747-8485; Khun Akorn,

FT  07 MAR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Cleaning up on the high seas - A
businessman who has always been sensitive to the environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

PAUL DE LA PENA's experience may be typical of the British small
businessman. 'All my working life we've been in a boom or a recession,' he
says.
Chairman and owner of the company that bears his name, de la Pena's response
has been atypical. Rather than dash for growth which becomes contraction a
year or two later, his dlP Group has looked for areas that will give it 10
to 15 years' solid expansion in its field of industrial oils and allied
services.
The company employs 52, with a Pounds 3.8m turnover in 1991. Since 1960 de
la Pena, who is 61, has had to refocus it into new areas three times. Its
latest production venture is penaMarine: environmentally-friendly cleaning
and maintenance fluids for international shipping; everything a modern
merchant ship needs to keep its decks, bilges and tanks gleaming. A
successful spin-off has been an identical product, consumer-packaged for the
environmentally-conscious leisure boat-user, launched recently at the London
Boat Show.
With the world's oceans increasingly patrolled by groups such as Friends of
the Earth, Rod Wood, dlP's managing director, says that chucking chemicals
over the side of a ship is a vanishing practice. Companies such as BP and
Shell will now only buy 'green' products for shipboard use.
The key to de la Pena's products is the absence of any petrochemical
element. The solvent is a substance called dilimonene, found abundantly in
citrus waste from oranges, lemons and grapefruit which have been crushed for
their juice. (It even smells naturally nice.)
'In my last year at university we had environmental chemistry,' says Wood.
'That was in 1971, and until about 18 months ago no one had done anything
with knowledge which had been around for 20 years. The science was there,
but it had to wait for opinion to come round and create a market.'
Paul de la Pena, son of a Cheltenham engineering family, was an
environmentalist before the phrase existed. 'The workshop environment was
awful when I served my apprenticeship,' he says. 'Floors black and slippy,
globules of oil on the beams. I could never understand why offices which
didn't need cleaning were cleaned every night, but never the machine shops.'
When the early 1960s slump hit sales of the machine tools he was importing
from Italy, de la Pena decided that selling consumables such as cutting
fluids was more sensible. When the norm in UK industry was still neat oil
costing three shillings a gallon, de la Pena began importing a US emulsified
product, easily cleaned, at 27 shillings.
'Buyers would invite me in just to see if this twit had two heads,' he
recalls. 'I used to pour the oil on to my suit in front of the boss, just to
show what it could do for cleanliness. In a small way we spearheaded the
change, making the machine shop as clean and effective as the boardroom.'
The oil sold well, but being a 'niche' player was tough going against the
resources of, say, Castrol or Mobil. By the late 1960s de la Pena was
thinking about the possibilities of recycling oil from machine sumps.
The upshot was a rugged industrial vacuum cleaner, brand-named Freddie. Rod
Wood says: 'Every blue-chip engineering company now uses a Freddie; it's
become a mature market, although exports are growing well,' The company
concedes that, from a strictly commercial perspective, the powerful, ugly
Freddie is perhaps over-engineered. 'The philosophy of the company is to
build a long-life product that can stand being rammed by a fork-lift truck
and come out alive,' adds Wood.
'We only come this way once. Whatever we make has got to last,' says de la
Pena. The Freddies cost slightly over Pounds 3,000 per unit. Last year the
group sold about 100 in the UK, with a further 138 exported - primarily to
France and Germany but with the US market growing quickly.
Hard work could maintain volume, but the specialist oils business seemed to
have little room for growth. In 1991 the de la Pena group identified the
marine cleanser market, when two other companies bowed out, leaving the
field clear for an intended worldwide duopoly between Unitor and Drew, the
giant chemicals companies.
'We have the technology already; it's a question of distribution and
specialising. The worldwide market is worth Pounds 40m a year, and we are
looking for about Pounds 10m of that within a couple of years,' says Wood.
He expects to see a 1992 turnover of about Pounds 700,000 for penaMarine -
from zero six months ago. 'It takes time to gain credibility with the major
owners, but we're being asked to tender for some big contracts. We're
already a credible alternative to the two huge suppliers.'
On the wall of the group's main factory in Pershore, Worcestershire, is a
motto put there by Paul de la Pena 20 years ago: 'Today's guardian of
Tomorrow's world.'
'I'm really excited by penaMarine,' he says. 'The real advantage of starting
with nothing is that you've got nothing to lose.'

FT  07 MAR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The tangy scent of hand-made
success - A company which works hard to preserve its image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A BOUQUET of interesting niffs assaults the nostrils of anyone venturing
deep into the countryside. The smell of newly-mown crops, the tang of
silage, the pong of manure generated by Britain's 190m farm animals.
At the back of the high street in the Wiltshire village of Sherston the
whiffs are of something different. Garlic, fresh onion, fenugreek. 'If I'm
not mistaken, that's barbecue sauce,' says William Tullberg.
Since messing about in his kitchen making a home-brew mustard 21 years ago,
Tullberg has built one those tiny family-owned food companies that dot the
British employment landscape. It has not scaled the heights of Baxters, the
much older Scottish soup and condiment maker, but Wiltshire Tracklements
cooked up turnover last year of Pounds 503,000, supporting four members of
the family and a 14 full and part-time staff.
Wiltshire Tracklements offers that ideal combination of whirring machinery
and the Good Life. A door leads straight from the factory to the Tullbergs'
own kitchen, at the other end of which is a vista of the river Avon and the
rolling edges of the Cotswolds.
Since 1988 yearly sales have leapt 125 per cent. 'The jump has been caused
by being fashionable,' says Jennifer Tullberg, company secretary and
William's wife. 'A lot of other companies went quite big last year and then
went under, so we picked up part of their business too.'
The 'tracklements' (a regional word for a food accompaniment) includes 14
types of mustard, Cumberland sauce (port, oranges, redcurrant juice), mince
meat with calvados and apple and sage jelly. They all come in small jars
with highly distinctive labelling, retailing at up to Pounds 1.50 each and
selling in around 300 delis, greengrocers and butchers as well as in Harrods
and at the Royal Horticultural Society at Wisley. Mustards still make up 45
per cent of sales.
The Tullbergs purchased the one acre site in Sherston seven years ago for
Pounds 70,000, spending a further Pounds 100,000 on it. The site includes a
shop which adds Pounds 12,000 a year to sales, a house and the tiny factory
that was once a bakery. Apart from horseradish whose cream requires a
preservative, the company's products are additive-free. Unlike many
condiment makers the company feeds spices like black peppercorns and
chillies into the mustard seed grinding process (rather than later) to
preserve oils and flavour, uses cider and wine vinegar rather than cheaper
malt vinegar, buys whole, frozen herbs and not powdered, and does not add
water to gain bulk.
The production unit incorporates some dinky equipment. A grinding machine
pulverises the locally-grown yellow mustard seed and the black seed from
Canada. A whirling apparatus shreds onions while another tool mixes pectin,
an apple derivative used to set jellies. Four waist-high boiling vats
produce the final mixtures, concoctions stirred by plastic paddles. A
jar-filling apparatus, a vacuumpacker bought for Pounds 35,000 and a Pounds
6,000 second-hand labelling machine rub shoulders with plastic tubs holding
turmeric, juniper berries and almonds.
Some 60 per cent of Wiltshire Tracklements' sales are from own-label
products, most of the rest sold under other labels like elderberry wine
jelly for the National Trust and grapefruit marmalade sold by Stonham. A
small element of sales derive from chutneys imported from India. Tullberg, a
food industry manager before going it alone, says exports account for almost
a fifth of sales. The company has got this without trying much. A Spanish
agent approached the Tullbergs at a food show in London and an Australian,
on the look out for unusual products for her homeland, spotted the Wiltshire
Tracklements label in Harrods. Tullberg has just visited the US on a sales
trip.
The company makes a net return of about 10 per cent though its pre-tax
profits are only Pounds 5,000. 'We are loading up our pensions and that sort
of thing,' says Tullberg. William and Jennifer take out yearly salaries of
Pounds 18,000 between them and their son, Guy, who runs the factory Pounds
14,000.
Many small food companies eventually ponder the problem of whether to supply
supermarket chains when they come knocking. Waitrose, Fine Fare and Tesco
all approached Wiltshire Tracklements though Tesco's price requirements were
so tough the Tullbergs could not match them and still make their present
rate of profit. Tullberg says flogging his own brand products to
supermarkets could cripple Wiltshire Tracklements' product image. 'That does
not debar us from producing for a supermarket's own label. I would not like
to do that though unless it was a manageable percentage of what we could
cope with if we suddenly lost that business. I would put that manageable
percentage at ten per cent.' The company is moving soon to a larger site
which will triple potential production capacity.
With so many relatively small outlets, transport takes some organising,
swallowing up ten per cent of business costs. The company has a 1.5 tonne
van for deliveries which makes at least one trip a month to London, Tullberg
and managing director John Wilkins do some of the driving.
The Tullbergs say they are determined not to compromise their 'hand-made'
production system even if output grows. Expansion raises the issue of
financing. Tullberg says the company's biggest headache is cash flow. The
delay between buying raw materials to receiving payments for deliveries
ranges between two and three and a half months. The company taps into a
Pounds 40,000 overdraft to fund this.
'We are confident that if we grow at no more than 20 per cent a year we
won't have to change our habits drastically nor need much outside finance,'
Tullberg says. 'We also believe there is enough in the market to allow us to
do that without too much recourse to direct selling to supermarkets.'
