FT  07 MAR 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Responsibility for bomb sites
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I LIVE in a terraced house which is adjacent to the site of houses destroyed
in the war. This land belongs to the London Borough of Southwark and has for
many years been left as a wilderness. In 1975, the council erected a
chicken-wire fence along the boundary of my front and back gardens. The
fence is now collapsing into my garden. After a long series of complaints to
the council, the land was cleared but the fence was not renewed. My deeds
are silent as to the ownership of the fence.
This land is open to the street and thus I have a security problem. Also, if
the land is not kept cleared the problem will recur of vegetation and
seedling trees growing into the fabric of my house (which forms the boundary
along its side wall), damaging any replacement fence and blocking the light.
There is also the sheer unsightliness of the site and the fence.
Can I compel the council to replace the fence and/or keep the site in
reasonable order?
You cannot compel the council to fence the site or to maintain the fence,
but you would be entitled to erect a fence at your own expense.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Avoiding a will
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A WIDOW owns her home valued at Pounds 80,000 which is registered in her
sole name. She also has about Pounds 30,000 in bank and building society
accounts also in her sole name.
She has made a will leaving the house and contents to her unmarried son who
has is a life-long resident in the house and leaving the other assets to her
married daughter.
However, the widow has been advised that, as there is no inheritance tax
liability, she could simplify the on-death position by re-registering the
house into a joint tenancy with her son and transferring the bank and
building society accounts into joint accounts on a survivor basis with her
daughter. This, she has been told, would mean that on her death the house
would automatically and immediately become the sole property of the son, and
the bank and building society accounts would similarly become the property
of the daughter, thereby avoiding any need for proving the will or of any
probate necessity.
Is this sound and legally permissible?
The course which has been suggested is permissible and would render probate
unnecessary without altering the position of there being no liability of
Inheritance Tax, always assuming that the valuation of the house is more or
less correct and that there is no marked increase in its value before the
death of the mother. It would be wise to ensure that there is a record of
there being a gift to the daughter of a beneficial interest in the bank and
building society accounts.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOUSE my husband and I live in is in my name only. It is a freehold
property, value approximately Pounds 200,000, registered with the Land
Registry and we purchased it in October 1987. There is a mortgage of Pounds
30,000 on it with the Halifax Building Society.
We would like to transfer the title into our joint names. There would be no
transfer of money. This would be a true joint ownership where the property
transfers to the survivor if one party dies ie: not the tenancy in common
type.
What would be involved in doing this? Could we do it ourselves, without
using a solicitor? Would the building society insist on also transfering the
mortgage to joint names? What would this involve? How much would this cost?
You can carry out the work yourself; the cost would be the registration fees
if the property is registered land (ie. the title is registered at H M Land
Registry). You would need to execute a transfer into joint names and lodge
it at the registry for registration. If you transfer the legal estate in
this way the mortgagee will require the creation of a fresh charge and the
issue of a new charge certificate. The cost, using a solicitor approved by
the building society, should not exceed Pounds 200 if there is no further
complication in the conveyancing, but you should ask the solicitor to give
you a figure in advance of employing him.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A Budget to boost Britain - Diary of a
Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE Labour and Conservative parties so close in the opinion polls, the
Budget announced by chancellor Norman Lamont on Tuesday could easily decide
the general election. So, what should he do?
As a private investor, I am not exactly enamoured of Labour's proposals to
reduce capital gains tax allowances and to tax such gains at 50 per cent -
and possibly more. Except for the stupid, capital gains are not 'unearned' -
it requires time and thought to select investments. Besides which, most
people have had to scrimp and save from their incomes so they have some
money available to invest. Surely they should be encouraged rather than
penalised for not having spent it all on frivolous living.
On the other hand, I fear the Conservatives will succumb to various pressure
groups and make changes in inheritance taxation so that even more money can
pass, tax-free, to people who have definitely not earned it. If such a
change is announced in the Budget, then Labour will seize on it as
'evidence' of the Conservatives rewarding the lazy and rich at the expense
of the hard-working poor. This could cost the Tories the election. In a
recession, voters are more concerned with the here and now than what might
happen in the hereafter.
In 1990, the then chancellor (and now prime minister), John Major, announced
that stamp duty on share transactions would be abolished when Taurus (the
City's electronic share settlement system) was implemented. This was
expected in 1991-92; but as Taurus is still some way in the future, stamp
duty should be abolished immediately - not only on share transactions but on
everything else (including house purchases) to which it applies. Stamp duty
is an unfair tax on investment: it is incurred regardless of whether a
profit is made. Its end is long overdue.
The taxation system on investments in shares by private individuals should
be changed to produce a more level playing field between them and
institutional investors; and also to encourage more direct investment in
shares, rather than having to invest via a personal equity plan or pension
fund manager.
A few years ago, under the heading 'chargeable assets acquired,' there was a
section in tax forms where people were expected to list the shares they had
bought. A similar section should be reinstated. Peps should be abolished,
and people could be given a share allowance of around Pounds 10,000 a year.
No tax would be required on any gains made from those shares, nor on the
gains made from re-investing the proceeds in further share purchases.
Similarly, people should be allowed to set aside an amount equivalent to
their pension plan payments which they could invest directly in shares
instead. They would pay no tax on any gains from such 'pension plan
nominated shares.' Tax would be payable only when benefits were taken from
this self-operated pension plan.
These changes in the tax structure would do much towards shifting the
balance of investment away from institutions and back into the direct
control of private investors.
To encourage fuel efficiency, the 10 per cent car tax should be abolished on
all vehicles capable of 40 miles a gallon or more. There should be no
increase in taxes on petrol as this raises the RPI and causes higher costs
for everyone, especially the lower-paid.
In the past, the chancellor has indicated that company cars might well
attract more tax. He should look at another option instead.
Drivers of these vehicles are more likely to have accidents than other
motorists. So, instead of increases in tax on the cars, the chancellor
should encourage better driving standards by taxing the actual benefit each
driver gets from company-paid insurance. Thus, company car drivers with a
poor road record who attract high insurance premiums would be taxed on the
direct cost of those - regardless of their salaries.
Rather than reduce income tax by one penny, the chancellor should raise
allowances substantially. For example, the single person's allowance should
be increased from Pounds 3,295 to at least Pounds 4,000; other allowances
should go up similarly. The chancellor could then boast about removing
hundreds of thousands of people from the tax net and a genuine reduction in
taxation on the lower-paid.
To demonstrate a 'caring attitude' and to reduce unemployment, the
chancellor should allow people to deduct from tax the cost of employing
nannies, home helps and care assistants. This would allow more single
parents to return to work, and keep more people out of hospital. Indeed, it
could well prove much cheaper than paying unemployment and other benefits
and costly hospital fees.
To reduce unemployment, increase low-cost housing and show that the
government plans for the long term rather than just the period between
elections, the chancellor should create an enormous new enterprise zone
stretching from east London's Docklands along the river Thames to the Maplin
sands at the mouth of the estuary.
No rates would be paid for 25 years within that area - provided that many
thousands of attractively-designed, low-cost houses also were built. This
would enable a new, 24-hour international airport to be built on the sands
(thus relieving the noise problems at existing airports). It would also
allow a new theme park to be constructed to rival Euro-Disney; this would
attract billions in foreign currency.
There also would be encouragement for new, modern factories and other
industries although, unlike Docklands, the roads and fast rail networks
should be planned first.
To discourage smoking, the chancellor could put a further 20p tax on a
packet of cigarettes. Alcohol tax could be increased, perhaps with as much
as 5p a pint on beer.
In his last Budget, the chancellor taxed one of his personal annoyances  -
mobile telephones. Perhaps this year he might impose a hefty tax on large,
noisy dogs (small, quiet dogs would be exempt) and a tax on pipe addicts who
insist on smoking in public rather than confining their foul-smelling
activities to their own homes.
Such a Budget would significantly encourage private investors, considerably
assist the lower-paid, help to reduce unemployment, and show that the
government has long-term plans.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Now unitholders will get 'perks'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS have long enjoyed 'perks' offered by the companies in which
they invest, but unitholders have been poor cousins until recently.
Unit trusts invest in a wide range of companies - the average per trust is
probably 60 to 80 - but they are regarded as institutional shareholders.
Companies traditionally have reserved their perks for direct private
investors.
But Barclays Unicorn, the fund management subsidiary of Barclays Bank, has
persuaded seven companies that offer perks to extend these to its
unitholders. The Unit Trust Association calls the move a 'very nice
innovation.'
The companies include Friendly Hotels plc, which is offering a 10 per cent
discount on accommodation and 5 per cent off functions held at these hotels
(which include the New Connaught Rooms in London's Covent Garden); and BET,
which provides support services to the travel industry and is offering
Unicorn unitholders 'a selection of special holiday packages in exotic
locations.'
The idea grew out of a deal done 10 years ago between Unicorn and Trafalgar
House, parent of the Cunard shipping line, under which Trafalgar extended
its shareholders' discount on some Cunard cruises to Unicorn unitholders.
Unicorn decided an extension was needed and David Chapman, the product
manager, says: 'We approached about 40 companies which provided benefits to
shareholders and began negotiating.'
The perks apply to all Unicorn's unitholders, regardless of which unit trust
holds the investment. Thus, a unitholder in Unicorn's Japan funds is
entitled to the discounts, offered by UK companies. 'We've taken everyone on
our registers at the beginning of January and extended the benefits to
them,' said Chapman. 'That's 160,000 potential customers for the companies.'

FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Housing: good and bad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THERE a ray of sunshine in the housing market? National Westminster Bank
believes so. It says estate agents have indicated an increase in activity
and a rise in mortgage applications in the first two months of 1992.
The hard news from the market is still bad. This week, two house price
indices showed that prices are falling steeply.
Nationwide's index revealed a 1.2 per cent fall in February and an overall
drop of 4.1 per cent since February 1991. Halifax came up with a drop of 1.1
per cent in February and 4.3 per cent in the past year.
Halifax agrees there are some signs of a revival - it would be surprising if
there were not, with the temporary cut in stamp duty and the January cut in
mortgage rates - and says it is now expecting small rises in house prices by
the second half of 1992.
Abbey National's chief executive, Peter Birch, says he thinks the worst of
the depression in the housing market is over. He concedes, however, that
repossessions will remain high throughout this year and probably 1993, and
that this will dampen the market.
While everyone is casting around for good news, any stirrings must be seen
in context. There has been a 3.5 per cent drop in prices since November,
according to Halifax.
If lenders and the government had not stepped in, however, this monthly
trend could have marked the beginning of a much more serious drop. And John
Wriglesworth, an analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, says none of the remedies
tried so far will be enough to enliven the market.
There is another option, though: increase MIRAS (mortgage interest relief at
source).
In December, the Council of Mortgage Lenders put a scheme to the government
which would 'front-load' tax relief. Under its provisions, first-time buyers
would be allowed to claim relief on loans up to Pounds 60,000 instead of the
present Pounds 30,000, but only for a limited period.
On Tuesday, we will know if the chancellor has been swayed by their
arguments.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The offshore way to soften hard Labour
 -The tax implications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of a Labour government, with plans for tax increases for high
earners, must be tempting many readers to move their money offshore. But
given that most UK citizens have to declare all their worldwide income to
the Inland Revenue, what advantages can offshore funds offer to investors
who do not want to break the law?
The main advantage is the ability to postpone, rather than avoid, tax. This
can be done by 'rolling up' rather than repatriating income on an offshore
fund. Tax is paid only when the income is actually taken out of the fund.
Essentially, such funds invest in cash deposits. A range of currencies is
available but, unless you are likely to face liabilities in a foreign
currency (if you plan to emigrate, for example), it is safer to stick to
sterling.
Using these funds, it might be possible to 'ride through' a high-taxing
Labour government and then repatriate the income once a Conservative
government returns to power. But the snags with this strategy are that
Labour might find some way of imposing tax disadvantages on overseas
investment; or, conversely, it might offer tax incentives to domestic
investors. Either way, the investor who had moved his money offshore
prematurely might regret it.
The second problem is that once Labour is in office, it might be there for
some time. Accordingly, investors could face a long wait for their money.
Nor is there any guarantee that if Labour raised taxes, a Tory
administration would be able to lower them.
For those willing to take the risk and plan for the long term, however,
there could be advantages in using the offshore route. They include:
Those approaching state retirement age.
Labour intends to introduce a top rate of tax of 50 per cent. In addition,
the upper limit on National Insurance payments will be abolished,
effectively adding a further 9 per cent on top; a tax which savers will pay
as well in the form of an investment income surcharge. Labour says that
those above state pension age will not pay the surcharge, nor will it be
paid on the pension income of those who retire early.
Nevertheless, there are plenty of people who will be hit by this increase.
Many people approaching retirement will have built-up their savings, and
those who have retired before 65 (60 for women) will often depend on
non-pension savings income for their standard of living.
By investing in a roll-up fund, they can postpone paying tax on such income
until state retirement age. At that point, not only will they probably be in
a lower tax band but they will not face the surcharge.
The snag, of course, is that many will not be able to afford to postpone
their income.
Parents investing for children
The normal scope for parents to give money to their children for investment
purposes is limited. If the income from such savings is over Pounds 100 a
year, it will be taxed as if earned by the parent. But if the money is
invested in a roll-up fund, it can be withdrawn after the child is 18. At
that point, the child will have his own personal allowance and money from
the roll-up fund can be taken as tax-free income.
However, cash funds historically have not been great investments over long
periods. If a child is young, it might be that an equity-based investment,
while perhaps less tax-efficient, might bring greater total returns.
Those moving abroad
Anyone who knows he will be leaving the UK can build up his savings in a
roll-up fund and avoid UK tax. He will, however, face tax payments in his
chosen country of residence. Thus, careful advice needs to be taken on the
nature of the tax regime in the new country.
There are three leading companies in the field at the moment - NM
Rothschild, Guinness Flight and Fidelity - and the rates they offer are
available each day in the FT managed funds pages. Guinness and Fidelity
recently have published free guides to the tax advantages of investing
offshore. To get them, contact Guinness Flight at Lighterman's Court, 5
Gainsford Street, Tower Bridge, London SE1 2NE; or Fidelity by calling
0800-414-161.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Look before you leap - How to . . .
invest in the BE / There's value to be had but caution is necessary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT COULD just be a marketing ploy. This year, as every year, the word is
that the business expansion scheme is due for sweeping changes. But some of
the BES schemes being marketed seem to have reduced the risk involved to an
extent never imagined by the government.
John Harrison, of Investment and Tax Publishing Services, points out that
changes to the scheme could be made in the Budget with immediate effect,
stopping the marketing of some schemes even before the end of the tax year.
The combination of tax incentives and a possible deadline could lead
investors into a headlong rush. This is dangerous, as many of this year's
most attractive schemes have sold out already. This does not mean that there
is no value to be found anywhere, but investors should exercise caution.
The rules of the scheme, in outline, are quite simple. You can invest a
maximum of Pounds 40,000 during a tax year. This need not necessarily all be
in the same BES company.
You then receive tax relief on this at your top marginal rate of tax. If you
are a top-rate, 40 per cent taxpayer, you will receive a rebate for 40 per
cent of the sum invested in the BES company.
You hold on to this tax relief only if you keep the BES shares for at least
five years. At the end of this period, providing the company remains in
existence, you are allowed to dispose of the shares (not always an easy job)
free of capital gains and income tax.
Most BES companies buy properties and then let them as assured tenancies,
following a change in the rules in 1988 designed to stimulate the private
rental housing sector.
When should you consider investing in a BES company?
David Wells, of chartered accountant Binder Hamlyn, says the scheme is
useful only to people paying 40 per cent tax. The benefits are much less
worthwhile for 25 per cent taxpayers. And, of course, you should never
invest for tax reasons alone.
It is important not to go overboard. If, for instance, you have already paid
the maximum into pension contributions, you might find that your gross
income no longer exceeds the threshold for top-rate tax by enough to receive
top-rate relief on all of the BES investment.
Wells says an accountant can work this out for you, but you should view the
BES only as part of end-of-tax-year planning.
A decision also will depend on your liquidity. If you cannot afford to
shelter the money and forego any income from it for five years, something
more flexible could suit you better. You can combine a BES investment with a
temporary annuity for five years, but this is cumbersome and adds to the
expense.
Assuming you have decided to go ahead, which type of scheme should you
choose?
Judged as pure tax-planning tools, the most attractive offerings are
precisely those thought to have the most endangered future - the 'buy-back'
or covenanted schemes.
They work by bringing in a second party, as well as the BES company. The
latter will buy assets in return for a covenant from the second party to buy
them back at a fixed price after five years.
The convenants are binding legally, so the investor should be safe unless
the 'guarantor' goes out of business. Most of them buy assured tenancies on
behalf of either housing associations or higher education colleges.
Such institutions do not have massive financial clout, though. Therefore,
both shareholders and sponsors have tried to find third party guarantors,
even though the legislation does not allow for a direct guarantee to
shareholders from a third party.
Some schemes have attempted to lessen risk further by making the 'buy-back'
self-financing. This can be done by arranging fixed-rate loans for the
buy-back company, and then setting up separate cash deposit accounts
ear-marked specifically for BES investors.
Normally, this still works out as cheap finance for the housing association
or unversity. In some cases, no new accommodation is either bought or built
 -a university can sell its accommodation to the BES company, bank the
proceeds, and still make a nice profit on the deal.
These cash-backed schemes usually offer a lower level of return than schemes
which have not attempted to arrange pre-payment. Also, some schemes will
have a relatively strong covenant because the buy-back company has a strong
balance sheet, while others may face an awkward financial stretch to make
their repayment.
Another variation is that some schemes will take longer to pay your tax
relief than others, and to complete the sales at the end of five years.
Either could lower the effective return you get.
Anthony Yadgaroff, of Best BES Advice, says strength of covenant should be
the first consideration, followed by the projected return.
Two other options allow for BES tax relief: trading companies which raise
risk finance; and assured tenancy companies, which aim for growth but do not
attempt to offer a guarantee.
Rental companies aiming for high growth try to take advantage of the
recession by buying properties on the cheap, renovating them, and then
letting them. The more squeamish investors might wish to avoid the growing
number of companies which specialise in buying repossessed properties at
auction.
If you believe that the market for residential property will stage a
significant recovery over the next five years, these schemes may make sense.
Wells recommends them to clients who have a large portfolio already.
While, generally, he recommends buy-back companies, he adds: 'The risk is
lower, but I don't think people should be blinded by the 16 per cent rates
on offer.'
Finally, there are trading companies. These should not really be regarded as
items of personal finance at all but as speculations.
Many small companies fail. But if they succeed, you could do very well
indeed - for example, present offerings allow you to buy into breweries,
lager importers, or film production companies.
Time remains of the essence if you want to invest in the BES. But do not be
in so much of a hurry that you do without professional advice. The telephone

FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: SIB life rule changes - Read the small
print
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE WHO want to shop around for life insurance will need to read a lot of
fine print and be adept with a calculator, thanks to plans which the
Securities and Investments Board will announce this week.
SIB raised the hopes of the consumer lobby last autumn when it suggested
that each company would have to give prospective customers an estimate of
its charges over the term of a life insurance policy. It suggested that the
final policy cost should be spelled out clearly in pounds. The new
proposals, however, deliver much less. Lobbying by life insurers has
convinced the SIB it should not insist on company specific charges.
Companies will be able to project charges based on the average of charges
across the industry. Thus, if you are looking for a low-cost producer, the
new rules are not going to help you much.
However, you may be able to glean some information about your charges by
reading the table of surrender values. The new rules will require sales
agents to give this to you before you sign anything. You will be entitled to
know the percentage of premiums you will be refunded if you cancel during
the first five years.
You will also be told the 'crossover' point, which is the length of time
before your return will be equal to the amount of premiums you have paid in.
On a typical 25-year endowment policy, the crossover point is about 12
years.
Using a calculator, you may glean more information. The SIB may require life
companies to say how much charges will reduce your investment return,
expressed as a percentage of cost per Pounds 100. Again, these charges will
be industry-wide.
But this will allow you to calculate that on a projected return of, say,
Pounds 50,000 on a 25-year endowment policy, a rate of Pounds 14 per Pounds
100 means you will have paid Pounds 7,000 in charges.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Analysts await word on BTR strategy -
The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR is expected to report lower annual pre-tax profits on Wednesday, but
most interest will focus on how the industrial conglomerate is digesting its
latest acquisition, Hawker Siddeley, the engineering group, which it bought
for Pounds 1.55bn in November after a bitterly-contested takeover battle.
BTR is unlikely to give anything away about possible disposals, but analysts
will want to hear what the enlarged group has to say about its trading
outlook. The impact of recession is expected to have cut last year's pre-tax
profits from Pounds 966m to below Pounds 900m.
As the world's largest mining group, the RTZ Corporation could not be
expected to escape the problems associated with recession in the US and the
UK and present low metals prices. Analysts expect the group to report on
Thursday a fall of about 35 per cent in net attributable profits for 1991.
This would take them down from last year's Pounds 507m to between Pounds
295m and Pounds 340m.
Most commentators suggest that RTZ will maintain its dividend payment at
19.5p because an increase to, say, 20p, would send the wrong signals about
prospects for the current year.
Standard Chartered Bank will announce on Wednesday pre-tax profits of Pounds
200m to Pounds 220m, a marked improvement on 1990's Pounds 150m after heavy
provisions.
It has had relatively few lending problems in the UK other than to Brent
Walker, while its Asia Pacific region had a good year and is thought to have
made a strong contribution. Last year's 20p dividend at is expected to be
maintained.
Hillsdown Holdings, the food manufacturer, should turn in 1991 pre-tax
profits of around Pounds 182m on Wednesday, down a little from Pounds 191.2m
a year earlier. A final dividend of around 6.4p, up 7 per cent, is expected.
Poultry will again peck away at group profits, contributing only Pounds 28m
(Pounds 59.4m) with a small loss in the UK offset by profits abroad. On the
positive side, Maple Leaf, its Canadian subsidiary, has performed well.
Encouraging developments include the recent purchase of Unigate's poultry
business which should help bring rationalisation to the industry and an
upturn in Hillsdown's profits this year to around Pounds 235m.
United Biscuits is expected to report on Thursday a small increase in 1991
pre-tax profits to Pounds 205m from Pounds 197.7m. Given the group's
confidence in its long term prospects, the final dividend could be raised 3
per cent to 9.4p.
McVities biscuits and Terry's chocolates have held their own but KP snack
foods have been disappointing. Bright spots last year were the growing
European operations and the Keebler biscuit business in the US.
Saatchi and Saatchi, feeling the pinch of the recession in advertising, is
likely to report on Tuesday a loss of around Pounds 50m for the 15 months
ended December. This will included provisions for unused office space and
restructuring costs. Even without those, it probably ran up a small loss of
Pounds 8.6m as it struggles to create a vibrant business after the swingeing
organisational and financial restructurings of last year.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: How to protect the family nest egg -
Tax-efficient settlements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GARNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARD TIMES mean that the preservation of wealth is top of the home agenda.
The 'family settlement' is a vital tool in protecting the wealth of your
family.
It can be used for tax mitigation as well as a mechanism to preserve wealth
against the ravages of spendthrift children and over-zealous creditors.
Money in a family settlement is no longer owned by you, (the settlor). But,
importantly, neither is it owned by your children or grandchildren (the
beneficiaries), to do with and spend as they please. It is owned by trustees
 -one of whom could be yourself  - who control and manage the trust money in
accordance with your instructions as set out in the trust deed.
This is of particular relevance to aspiring entrepreneurs who use a family
settlement as a means of distributing the family's nest eggs to protect
family wealth from bad luck in business.
But this is not a wheeze to escape creditors altogether. Under the
Insolvency Act 1986, if within two years of setting up the trust an order of
bankruptcy is made against you, the trustee in bankruptcy can have the trust
set aside and make the assets available to your creditors.
Similarly a trust can be set aside if it took place within two to five years
of the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, if it can be shown that you
were insolvent at the time of, or as a result of, setting up the trust.
Even after five years, a creditor can still have a settlement set aside but
only if he can prove to the court's satisfaction that the settlement was
created with the intention of defeating creditors. After five years,
however, this is usually an uphill struggle.
Another common incentive for setting up a family settlement is to protect
the family wealth from bounty-hunting spouses.
If you create a family settlement for your children or grandchildren it is
unlikely that your spouse will be able to overturn it, or have this taken
into account, unless it was set up deliberately to defeat a divorcing
spouse's claim.
The situation is not so clear if you set up a trust for a child, which
specifically excludes his wife from benefit. Following the case of Browne v
Browne 1988, a court can take into account the realistic expectations from a
settlement.
Just because money is in the family settlement does not mean that it is dead
money. Provided the trustees exercise their duties in accordance with the
trust deed and the ultimate benefit of the beneficiaries, there is nothing
to stop them investing in the shares of your family company or in your new
joint venture.
There are also many tax advantages in setting up a family settlement,
although these vary according to the type of trust created. If you set up a
grandchildren's settlement, the income paid to your grandchild will be taxed
as his or her personal income. This is not true of a children's settlement
established by a parent.
Very often it is overlooked that a grandchildren's settlement is of real
financial assistance to the parents, since the income can be used for all
spending in connection with the children - including school fees, and
clothes.
There can also be capital gains tax advantages in trusts. Capital gains made
in a trust where income must be paid out to the beneficiaries (ie an
interest in possession settlement) will be taxed at only 25 per cent. In
other types of settlement the rate is 35 per cent - provided you, the
settlor, are not also a beneficiary. Both rates are better than the 40 per
cent top rate of CGT.
Whether and to what extent the trustees have to pay money to the
beneficiaries will depend upon what the trust deed says. Although most
settlors would like a trust deed to be fully flexible as to when and to whom
payments are to be made, the inheritance tax provisions usually dictate
otherwise except for children under 25.
Most settlements created today are therefore either flexible trusts for
children under 25 (often called 'accumulation and maintenance trusts') or
trusts for adults where the income must be paid out to a specific
beneficiary and cannot be accumulated (often called 'interest in possession
trusts').
Exactly what assets should be transferred into trust will largely depend
upon the increase or decrease in value of the settlor's assets since they
were acquired. In the Finance Act 1989, gifts into trust or otherwise became
chargeable to capital gains tax with a few exceptions. The most notable
exceptions are for gifts of private company shares and business assets.
If the Labour party is elected, the preservation of wealth through the
creation of family settlements could be seriously curtailed. Labour's Policy
Review for the 1990s says it will introduce more effective and progressive
taxation of inheritance, including lifetime gifts. From then inheritance tax
could prohibit the formation of accumulation and maintenance trusts and
interest in possession trusts.
Therefore, if you are thinking of creating a settlement for your family, you
may only have until the election to do so in a tax efficient manner.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: How to find a cure for your CGT
headache - Capital gains tax complexities for the private investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAPITAL gains tax is paid by a small minority of people
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
165,000 last year - but probably causes headaches for many more.
The tax is payable on only a limited number of assets and there are reliefs
available. An individual is entitled to an annual allowance (Pounds 5,500 in
1991-92); to an indexation allowance giving protection from the effects of
post-1982 inflation; and to offset losses against gains.
In the past five years, many equity investors must have been wishing they
had done well enough to worry about CGT.
Nevertheless, for substantial private investors, the process of calculating
the CGT bill is complex and time-consuming. Without careful planning, the
tax can take a nasty bite from your investment profits.
Investors often indulge in potentially costly transactions known as 'bed and
breakfast' deals to avoid future CGT bills.
The end of the tax year is the time for investors to work out their CGT
liability.
For some, it could be worth realising some gains to use up as much as
possible of this year's allowance - it cannot be carried forward. And, there
is the election to consider.
Labour plans
If Labour forms the next government, CGT changes may focus on two issues:
the level of annual exemption and the possibility of making a structural
reform of the tax.
Chris Smith, the party's Treasury spokesman, said Labour does not have
immediate plans to change CGT. However, there is speculation that the
present annual exemption is likely to be reduced, although it might stay
above the level of the basic income tax allowance (Pounds 3,295 at present).
Rumours that the annual CGT exemption could be dropped to as low as Pounds
1,000 have been denied robustly.
Smith said Labour is considering changes which would relate to the length of
time an investment had been held. 'Our medium-term aim is to look at a
differential rate to encourage longer-term holdings,' he said.
Those with gains realised over a shorter period would, therefore, pay a
higher rate than others.
Smith added that the tiers might not even be restricted to two bands but
could be extended to three. He would not speculate on how long the 'shorter'
and 'longer' term might be.
Investments which usually are exempt from CGT
The good news is that there is a large range of items which do not face the
bite of the tax. These include: Your main home (including a caravans or
houseboat); personal equity plans; gilts; National Savings (certificates,
yearly plan, premium bonds, capital bonds, SAYE deposits); life insurance
policies; currency for personal use abroad; betting winnings; shares issued
after March 18 1986 under the BES and sold more than five years after you
bought them; damages awarded to you for personal or professional wrong or
injury; gifts to charities; gift of heritage property; and chattels with a
predictable life of no more than 50 years when you first acquired them (so
long as they were not used in your business). Gains on chattels with a
predictable life of more than 50 years may be CGT-free subject to certain
rules.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Avoiding tax bills
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE a number of tax shelters available which can avoid CGT. The most
prominent are the Business Expansion Scheme and the Personal Equity Plan.
Investors can place Pounds 40,000 in a tax year in a BES (see Page V) but
for the CGT exemption to apply the investment must be held for five years.
There is no time limit on a Pep but an investor can invest only a maximum
Pounds 9,000 (via a Pounds 6,000 general and a Pounds 3,000 single company
Pep) in any one tax year.
The snag with both is that there is no guarantee of a profit. Investors may
choose inappropriate investments, and face hefty losses, if they pick the
wrong schemes. Losses in these shelters cannot be offset against gains
elsewhere.
Married couples
One way of lessening your CGT bill in any single tax year if you are married
and living together, is to transfer assets to your spouse. There are two
instances in which this makes sense: to use up your spouse's Pounds 5,500
allowance or to ensure that gains are taxed on the spouse with the lower tax
rate.
Since April 6 1990 (when independent taxation was introduced), it has not
been possible to offset your losses against your spouse's gains or vice
versa in order to pay less tax.
The transfer will be considered a gift and it must be made unconditionally.
Assets will still be taxed for CGT purposes as if your spouse had acquired
them at the same time that you had. Suppose you bought shares in 1987 and
transferred them to your spouse in 1991. When they sell the shares, they
will, broadly speaking, pay CGT as if they had acquired the shares in 1987.
The method of transfer depends on the gift. To transfer shares, you must
fill in a share transfer form (claiming exemption from stamp duty). For an
object such as a painting, you might need to ask a solicitor to draw up a
deed of gift, although an exchange of letters might suffice.
Bed-and-breakfast deals
The annual CGT allowance cannot be carried forward to subsequent tax years,
and this opens up the scope for the bed and breakfast deal. In essence, this
involves selling an asset and buying it back shortly afterwards.
Through such a deal, an investor can use up his annual allowance and avoid a
hefty tax bill in future years. This may be particularly attractive this
year, with the prospect of lower CGT thresholds under Labour.
One problem is that a bed and breakfast deal involves costs, such as
commission, and the risk that prices might move while the investor is out of
the market. Further snags are detailed by Ralph Newns in the accompanying
article.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bed-and-breakfasting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH NEWNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE TAX year will effectively end two days early for investors
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
on Friday, April 3 1992. People who want to reduce their 1991-92 CGT bills
by establishing allowable losses, therefore, must not leave things until the
very last minute, writes Ralph Newns.
For a shareholding or other investment which has become virtually worthless,
a negligible value claim can be submitted on April 1 or 2, under section 22
(2) of the CGT Act 1979.
The April Retail Price Index has consistently been significantly higher than
the March figure (between 1 per cent and 3 per cent higher in recent years)
so it is always worth waiting until the first couple of days of April to
make negligible value claims, so as to establish the highest possible loss
for CGT purposes.
If you miss the statutory deadline of April 5, it is possible to put in a
retrospective claim by virtue of extrastatutory concession D28 (published in
the free Revenue booklet IR1) but it is generally better to claim one's
rights under the law than to have to ask for the tax relief by concession.
Traditional bed and breakfast deals, namely a sale in the afternoon and a
purchase next morning, do not work for what-is-called 'relevant securities'.
Briefly, these are:
securities covered by the accrued-income scheme;
deep-discount securities;
shares etc in non-qualifying offshore funds.
To establish an allowable loss on a holding of convertible loan stock, for
example, requires particular care (including consideration of the
consequences under the accrued income scheme rules), because the settlement
day for the reacquisition must be later than that for the sale.
There is no room to go into details here, but the principles will be
familiar to readers who recall the transactions which replaced traditional
B&amp;B between the 1982 and 1985 Finance Acts and which became known as board
and lodging.
It is worthwhile to restate the basic principles of traditional
bed-and-breakfast for listed shares (excluding shares in offshore funds, as
mentioned above):
there must not be any agreement on Day One (the day of the 'bed' sale) that
a 'breakfast' purchase will take place on Day Two;
full beneficial ownership must pass to the counterparty on Day One.
These basic principles are readily satisfied on the Stock Exchange, of
course, but they make it virtually impossible to do an effective B &amp; B
outside the Exchange.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Calculating your bill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU sell an asset which is not in the above list, you may have to pay
CGT. To find out, you need to make a complex calculation:
first, take the sale proceeds, then
deduct the cost or value of the asset when you bought it, inherited it or
were given it (except by your spouse, see below)
deduct allowable expenses, such as brokers' commission and stamp duty.
The result is your unindexed gain. But the Inland Revenue allows you to
offset the effects of inflation after March 1982. Each month, it produces
indexation allowances for the previous month (which are published in the
Weekend FT), which reflect the increase in the Retail Price Index.
Assets bought before April 6 1982 have special rules (normally the March 31
1982 value is taken as the initial value). If prices have risen by 50 per
cent between the month in which you bought the asset and the month in which
you sold it, then indexation will reduce your taxable gain.
For example, if the asset cost Pounds 1,000 and the proceeds of sale were
Pounds 6,000. Indexation would reduce your gain by Pounds 500.
Repeat the process for all the assets you have sold in the tax year. Total
up the gains, deduct the losses and, if the result is over Pounds 5,500, you
will have to pay CGT.
This gain is added to your basic income and taxed at 25 per cent if your
taxable income (including the gain) is under Pounds 23,700 and at 40 per
cent if it is above that.
Batches of shares
Alas, the above calculation, complex enough, applies only to shares bought
in one lump. Many investors will have gradually built up shareholdings in
companies over several years.
According to the Which? Tax Savings Guide (published by the Consumers'
Association) if you sell shares which you have acquired in batches, they
will be treated as being sold in the following order:
any shares which you acquired on the day of disposal;
any shares acquired within the previous nine days;
any shares acquired after April 5 1982;
shares acquired after April 5 1965 and before April 6 1982;
shares acquired on or before April 5 1965.
For most people, the problems will arise on dealing with shares acquired
since 1982. Here the rules are complicated.
The first task is to deal with shares bought between April 6 1982 and April
5 1985. Total the cost, and add the indexation allowance between dates of
purchase and April 1985.
Divide this total by the number of shares acquired in the period; the result
is the indexed value per share.
If you bought shares after April 5 1985, you add the initial cost of such
shares to the indexed value of your 1982-1985 batch (including indexation
between April 1985 and the date of the next purchase). You have a new
indexed total, and can calculate a new indexed value per share.
When you come to sell, you can apply further indexation from the month of
your last purchase to the month of sale.
Rights issues and bonus issues
Shares acquired in such issues are treated on an averaging basis. On a
rights issue, apply the same indexation calculations to the rights shares as
you do to the original shares. Add the two indexed values together and
divide by the total number of shares; the result is your average, indexed,
cost per share. There are complications, however, and you should consult an
accountant.
The treatment of bonus issues (free issues of shares) is more simple. When
you come to sell, divide the indexed value of your holding by the total
number of shares, including the bonus shares. So, if you had 5,000 shares
acquired at an indexed cost of Pounds 7,500 - and there was a one-for-one
bonus issue - your indexed value per share would fall from 150p to 75p.
Further information
Leaflets from the Inland Revenue which explain the intricacies of the tax
include CGT4 (owner occupied houses); CGT13 (indexation allowance for quoted
shares); CGT 14 (an introduction); CGT15 (a guide for married couples) and
CGT16 (indexation allowance; disposals after April 5 1988).
CORRECTION
In last week's A-Z of Personal Finance, it was stated that capital gains tax
is payable on gilts. This is not, of course, the case. We apologise for this
error.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cadbury gives cause for applause - The
Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY chairman of a company with British Aerospace's problems needs all the
good news he can get. So, when Sir Graham Day slipped this week into another
of his many roles, as chairman of Cadbury Schweppes, he could be forgiven
for making a meal of its impressive full-year results. These, he said,
marked 'a record year in every respect.' In spite of sluggish 2.7 per cent
sales growth, pre-tax profits raced ahead by 13.2 per cent to Pounds 316.4m,
bettering the most optimistic forecasts. Earnings rose 9.6 per cent to
27.73p a share while gearing fell 49 per cent to 39 per cent.
Cadbury's classy performance marks a further pay-off for its strategy of
focusing tightly on core businesses, applying firm cost controls, and
ploughing heavy investments into improving manufacturing efficiency and
marketing support. This is just the kind of proven formula the City likes in
food companies nowadays, and it has helped Cadbury's shares out-perform the
sector by 12 cent in the past year - although they eased slightly after the
results.
Can Cadbury continue to justify its premium rating? Analysts think there is
plenty of scope for further growth and expect pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 345m this year.
The latest results underline the star role of the soft drinks business,
which increased operating profits by 12.5 per cent. Acquisitions have
expanded Cadbury's international presence greatly in recent years, and Les
Pugh of Salomon Brothers reckons the division can look forward to annual
profit gains of 16 per cent. In the US, the company defied a weak soft
drinks market last year to increase volumes faster than any of its rivals.
Although only a small player by the standards of Coca-Cola and Pepsi,
Cadbury claims to be benefiting from a demographic shift in favour of
'adult' soft drinks.
In Britain, where Cadbury's beverage operations are handled by a joint
venture with Coca-Cola, a drop in leisure drinking cut sales volumes by nine
per cent. Yet, operating results still rose 17.8 per cent, thanks to success
in pushing through price increases.
The real engine of growth is likely to be continental Europe, where soft
drinks' consumption is only one-third the level in the US. Volumes are
expected to increase strongly in the next few years, propelled by
heavyweight marketing campaigns by Coke and Pepsi. Cadbury lacks a cola but
it is well placed to cash-in on overall market growth. A series of deals has
enabled the company to build a bottling network second only to Coke and add
local brands, such as Gini and Oasis in France, which it is extending beyond
their home markets.
By comparison, the company's confectionery operations offer a less exciting
prospect. Although they did well to increase market share and profits in a
recession-bound British market last year, their overall trading results
advanced only 4.4 per cent, slightly less than their growth in sales.
Longer term, Cadbury faces a dilemma. Already, it leads its home market,
where its rock-solid position is rooted in Britons' liking for milky
chocolate. But this preference is shared hardly anywhere else except
Australia. As a consequence,international sales expansion faces a 'taste
barrier'.
Cadbury's efforts to overcome it by acquiring continental companies with
local brands, notably Poulain in France, have not been wildly successful.
Furthermore, the highly-concentrated structure of Europe's chocolate
industry means there is little else available to buy - although
opportunities may remain in the more fragmented sugar confectionery
business.
So, where can Cadbury turn for growth? One option would be to forge an
alliance of the kind the company has already with Coke in beverages. The
obvious candidate is Jacobs Suchard of Switzerland, the only big European
chocolate-maker without a strong UK presence. Philip Morris, Suchard's
well-heeled US owner, has of course long topped the list of predators
rumoured to be stalking Cadbury. The British company is now thoroughly
inured to questions on this point, and Day went out of his way last week to
emphasise that it would not be easy meat.
He said Cadbury was determined to make itself as expensive as possible by
maintaining a high price-earnings ratio. 'Any potential acquirer is going to
have to have deep pockets,' he declared. adding that fiercely-independent
companies always tended to cost bidders more.
Just how much of Cadbury's share price is due to a bid premium is debatable.
Most analysts believe its present level has more to do with the 'flight to
quality' which has occurred as the market has grown wary of the recession's
impact on lesser food stocks. Either way, Cadbury's management has a
powerful incentive to keep on running hard.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Lamont begins the triple whammy -
Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PHRASE 'double whammy' made it into the electioneering headlines this
week but it is a 'triple whammy' which will concern most investors this
weekend.
A combination of the Budget, the end of the tax year and a general election,
all within the next five weeks, will force many into some hasty
decision-making.
The temptation is to rush into investments in an effort to avoid tax,
particularly at the higher rates for higher earners which will be imposed by
a Labour government.
The snag, which we have been trying to emphasise for the last few weeks, is
that tax shelters rarely come without a penalty. Either the investor has to
tie up his or her money for a long period, or receives no income, or faces
charges which might outweigh the tax savings. Worst of all, he might lose a
good proportion of his money. Better to pay tax on a profit than to make no
profit at all.
There are plenty of other caveats. It would be pointless to lock away your
savings for a long period if you then find that higher tax rates make it
difficult for you to make ends meet on your income. You could find yourself
requiring instant access to your savings.
And a Labour government might not be elected, so you might tie up money
without good cause. Also remember, that if the Conservatives call an
election next week, Tuesday's Budget would only be implemented if they won
at the polls, so take care before rushing out to take action after you hear
Norman Lamont's Budget speech.
Private investors should think hard about their individual needs - and only
then see if any tax-efficient investments meet those needs.
There are some obvious points - such as tax efficiency within the family.
Husband and wife each have personal income tax allowances of Pounds 3,295
and a tax-free capital gains allowance of Pounds 5,500. One may be taxed at
40 per cent and the other at 25 per cent. Efficient use of these allowances
and differential rates can save a good deal of tax.
If the top rate of tax under Labour rises to 50 per cent (plus 9 per cent
NI), then it is likely to make sense to use savings to pay down that part of
your mortgage which is over the band for tax relief (currently Pounds
30,000). Otherwise you will be paying interest out of heavily taxed income
and then facing the same taxes on your savings income.
With mortgage rates currently at 10.5 per cent, then a top rate taxpayer
would need to earn a gross return of more than 21 per cent from his savings
under Labour to be better off not paying down the loan. And those who face
the investment income surcharge on top would need to earn a staggering 25.6
per cent.
A Tessa (Tax Exempt Special Savings Account) offers the chance for tax-free
interest. If you pick a Tessa without transfer penalties, there are no real
disadvantages. Although the tax break only arises if you keep the capital
within the Tessa for five years, all that happens if you withdraw your money
is that you pay income tax. You would have done that if had you left the
money in the building society. And rates on Tessas are in many cases better
than those on conventional building society accounts.
Those who are sure that they can survive without their money for five years
should also consider the attractions of National Savings certificates, which
offer per annum rates of either 8.5 per cent fixed or 4.5 per cent plus
inflation.
An individual investor could this year accumulate as much as Pounds 23,000
in Tessas and National Savings certificates - and get tax free returns
without any risk to the nominal value of their capital.
Again, those who are worried about capital loss, might find attractions in
an offshore roll-up fund, which would allow them to postpone tax (see Page
V). Here again, the snag is that you also have to postpone receiving your
income. The tax-free capital gains offered by indexed-linked gilts may also
appeal, especially if you believe that a Labour government will mean higher
inflation.
Other tax breaks, which are more heavily marketed, need extra care. Some
would argue that you can never make too much provision for your pension, but
there is a danger at the moment that too many people are switching out of
good company schemes and into personal pensions.
Remember that money put aside for a pension is 'lost' until you retire and
that the charges on a regular payment pension plan are heavy in the early
years. If you get fed up with your pension manager and want to switch, the
transfer value may be much lower than the amount you paid in premiums.
And personal equity plans are fine for those who have large equity
portfolios, and are long term investors. But for a basic rate taxpayer with
Pounds 7,000 in the building society, to put Pounds 6,000 in a Pep makes
little sense. He will probably pay 5 per cent or more in charges, which at
current tax rates and equity yields will take several years to recover. And
if he suddenly needs the money for a new car next year, he may not get his
capital back.
The tax attractions of a Business Expansion Scheme (see page V) are among
the most appealing of all, but again caution is needed in selecting a
scheme. Getting your money out again after the five year period is up is
often the trickiest part of the investment.
Good independent financial advice is essential in these matters.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Dow obeys the law of supply and demand
 -Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER the flaws in the science of economics, it is hard to fault the laws
of supply and demand. If a lot of people want something which is in limited
supply, the price goes up.
So it is with the US stock market at present. Reports suggest that
investors' money is still pouring into stocks at a staggering rate, as low
interest rates make alternative investments appear relatively unattractive.
Merrill Lynch, the largest retail brokerage firm in the US, is thought to be
attracting around Dollars 275m (Pounds 156.2m) every 24 hours. Other
brokerage firms are also seeing substantial inflows.
With this kind of 'weight of money' behind the market, it is perhaps
unsurprising that Wall Street should continue to scale new heights - even if
the heady daily gains of late-December and January are a thing of the past,
and progress comes in fits and starts.
The only events which seem likely to seriously reverse this situation
include a serious setback in the economy or some dramatic change in the
interest rate scenario. There has been little indication of either. That
does not necessarily mean that future events will unfold smoothly: even if
the weight of money gives a solid underpinning to the market, there are
plenty of pundits who suggest that a temporary correction is due. This, they
postulate, might take the Dow back below 3,200.
So it was against this rather ambivalent background that the Dow Jones
Industrial Index climbed almost 15 points to 3290.25 on Tuesday - nudging
ahead of the previous week's record close, at 3283.32. But as with many of
the 'new records' set recently, this remained a half-hearted affair. The
more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index managed only a 0.4
point gain, to 412.85, shy of its all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite Index,
which measures over-the-counter stocks, fell 1.22 points to Dollars 634.25.
On Wednesday and Thursday, the nerves set in. Waves of profit-taking, ahead
of Friday morning's unemployment data, caused falls of over 20 points in the
Dow on both days. Publication of the figures provoked fewer ripples, the Dow
still dithered.
The economic statistics remain opaque - but even the worst news is not so
bad that it merits a rethink by investors. Part of Tuesday's rise, for
example, was attributed to the sharp rise in January's index of leading
indicators. This showed a 0.9 per cent advance, compared with a 0.2 per cent
fall in December.
New single-home sales in January also surged, while, on Monday, the February
'purchasing managers' index' - another measure of activity in the industrial
economy - showed a reading of 52.4 per cent. (Any figure over 50 per cent
suggests that the economy is expanding, and in January, the index had stood
at 47.4 per cent).
Friday's unemployment figures were a slightly different story. There was an
unexpectedly large rise in non-farm payrolls last month, up 164,000 while
manufacturing employment rose by 12,000. This was tempered by the Labor
Department's revision of its estimate for January's fall in non-farm jobs
from 91,000 to 149,000. Meanwhile, the headline unemployment statistic rose
by 0.2 percentage points to 7.3 per cent - the highest figure since July
1985.
This broad picture aside, there are still plenty of individual situations
which could give cause for concern. On Thursday, Toronto's Olympia &amp; York
Developments, the property giant run by the Reichmann brothers, sent a
shiver round the market. Rumours that the company might file for bankruptcy
protection - speedily denied  - sent shares in several large US commercial
banks lower. Chemical lost Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 31 1/2 , Chase Manhattan
slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 22 1/2 and even the mighty J. P. Morgan
eased Dollars 1 to Dollars 59.
ITT, the conglomerate whose interests range from insurance to hotels, was
also active. News that the company was selling its remaining 30 per cent in
France's Alcatel, sent the shares up Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 69 7/8
midweek. By Friday, in the wake of a more cautious stance by Rand Araskog,
ITT's chairman, on further divestitures, the shares had fallen back to
Dollars 63 7/8 .
Anyone hoping to glean some insights in the economy's progress from the
February sales figures posted by most large retailers on Thursday,
meanwhile, would have simply been confused. At one end of the scale,
Wal-Mart, the aggressive Arkansas-based discount retailer, reported a
same-store sales gain of 20 per cent; by contrast, Woolworth managed just
3.1 per cent on the domestic front. Most other retailers came in at between
six and nine per cent.
Like most of the economic news at the moment, it could be better. But it
could also have been worse.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Old favourite emerges from the depths
 -London Markets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BLINK, and you missed it. In the past four weeks, shares in WPP, the
advertising agency, have risen from 42p to 91p, a rise of 117 per cent. WPP
warrants, a highly geared bet on the stock, have risen more sharply still,
to close at 7 1/2 p. Warrant-holders have nearly quadrupled their money, on
paper, in less than a month.
WPP benefited from two developments: the winning of two big advertising
contracts in recent weeks, and the growing feeling among US investors that
advertising volumes are about to pick up. WPP owns the J Walter Thompson and
Ogilvy &amp; Mather advertising agencies, so it stands to benefit greatly from
any such upturn.
Other media businesses have risen, but by much less. The shares of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi, which also has big US operations, has risen 20 per cent in the same
period, to close at 16 1/2 p yesterday. The Media sector of the FT-Actuaries
All-Share index has risen by 5 per cent in four weeks, outperforming the
overall market by 4 per cent.
Why has WPP so far outstripped its rivals? Partly because of its big account
wins, no doubt. But also because its finances are so weak, after the
borrowing necessary to acquire these agencies, that there has been a
longstanding question-mark over whether it would survive at all. An inflow
of new business that ensures its future transforms it from a potential
disaster to a company that should be valued on the basis of its strong brand
names and market position.
Once investors shift their view in this way, the spectacular decline in
WPP's stock over the past five years - which, as the chart shows, quite
dwarfs the recent run-up in price - is transformed from a liability to an
asset. Instead of being a constant reminder of the depths to which the
company has sunk, it becomes a beacon of the value once attached to it. No
one expects those heady valuations to return, of course, but even a partial
recovery is a tantalising prospect. Hence the speed with which WPP has leapt
ahead.
That may prove illusory: the rise in price may now have run its course, and
the company's financial outlook is still uncertain. The general lesson,
however, is that the biggest leaps in price in difficult times such as these
are made by some of the companies over whom the clouds once hung darkest.
One one condition: economic recovery must arrive before the bailiffs. This
week it looked likely that in the US that race is entering its final
furlong, with the bailiffs behind by a nose. In the UK, it was still
uncertain just how much further there is to the finishing line.
One indicator turned from optimism to pessimism during the week: short-term
UK interest rates, which had reflected an expectation that base ruts would
be cut around the time of next week's Budget, rose on Thursday. At their new
level, they indicated that the market is worried that a weak pound will
preclude any early cut in rates. The stock market, which had been displaying
a certain amount of bounce earlier in the week, reacted badly: the FT-SE
index closed on Thursday at 2538.3, down 20.1. On Friday, it edged a little
lower, closing at 2533.1, down 29.0 on the week.
Companies reporting their results this week continued to report no signs
that trading is improving. In other respects, the results season is proving
more or less true to expectations. Warburg Securities' running calculation
of how big companies' actual results compare with its analysts' end-January
predictions shows that pre-tax profits for industrials are smack in line
with estimates, at 6 per cent down on last year, so far. Industrials'
post-tax earnings are slightly better, at 10 per cent down compared with an
expected 11 per cent. Industrial companies are paying dividends 10 per cent
higher than a year ago, compared with an estimate of 9 per cent.
Non-industrial companies are doing slightly worse, dragged down, presumably,
by the banks.
Two unexpected trends, as the market braces itself for an election, were the
apparent lack of impact of political news and individual opinion polls; and
a reappearance of takeovers and rights issues, despite the uncertain weeks
that lie ahead. The lack of political excitement is doubtless partly
attributable to the UK's membership of the ERM, which locks economic policy
firmly into a rigid framework of consensus. It also stems, however, from a
growing belief that the most likely outcome of the election is a hung
parliament, and that therefore one day's opinion polls do not matter so
much.
The rights issues include some big ones: Pounds 333.5m from Bowater, the
packaging group, to finance two acquisitions; and Pounds 516m from Thorn
EMI, to buy Virgin Music, Richard Branson's privately-owned record company.
Bowater's rights issue was priced at 605p, a 27 per cent discount to the
market price of its shares. Thorn EMI's more complex offering involves
partly-paid loan stock units that convert into one ordinary share if the
deal goes through and the stock becomes fully paid; and into 0.4 shares if
the deal falls at a regulatory hurdle and the stock is never paid up. Each
unit is priced at 650p, a 17 per cent discount to the market price.
Despite the size of the rights issues, the shares of both companies reacted
well to the news. Bowater dropped only 3p on the day and closed the week at
785p, up 17p. Thorn EMI, which had fallen from 809p a week ago to 785p on
Thursday night, as the Virgin deal became increasingly likely, leapt when
the rights issue was announced. It closed on Friday at 806p, down only 3p on
the week. There were special reasons for Thorn's strong performance, not
least a promise of an immediate tripling of Virgin Music's profits. But the
healthy reaction to the rights issues is another sign the market is taking
the pre-election excitements calmly.

FT  07 MAR 92 / The Long View: Tory twists and turns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT WEEK'S will be the 14th Budget statement since the Conservatives came
to power in 1979, and it could be their last for a while. If the advance
publicity is correct, and Norman Lamont reduces taxes at a time of rapid
rises in public borrowing, it will also be uncharacteristic of what we have
become used to - although no doubt the word 'prudent' will figure as
prominently as ever.
It is revealing to make comparisons with the very first Budget of the
series, Sir Geoffrey Howe's post-election effort in June 1979. In some
respects, the economic parameters were rather similar, with public borrowing
(if you include asset sales) forecast at about 5 per cent of GDP - very much
the same as Lamont is likely to project for 1992-93. But interest rates were
somewhat higher than they are now, and the inflation rate substantially so.
Labour had been in power for 11 out of the previous 15 years, and great
weight was placed by Howe on tackling the failures of the supply side of the
economy. He focused on reducing the role of the state, after the overdose of
interventionism, and he aimed particularly to cut back the financial demands
of the public sector. Cheekily he quoted the famous remark of the former
Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan in 1976, which is again worth
repeating in full.
'We used to think,' said Callaghan, 'that you could just spend your way out
of a recession and increase employment by cutting taxes and boosting
government spending. I have to tell you in all candour that this option no
longer exists.'
It seems that we are likely to get a very different viewpoint from Norman
Lamont next Tuesday. Cutting taxes and increasing spending will indeed
figure in his proposals. And in all candour I suggest that we will not hear
very much about the failures of the supply side, although it is deeply
depressing that in the single month of January the UK should have sustained
a visible trade gap of more than Pounds 1bn even though the economy is
arguably in the worst recession for perhaps 60 years.
However, there is a crucial difference in that the overall public debt
burden of the economy is now much lower. Howe was reacting to the public
borrowing binge of the 1970s, which had taken the national debt up to nearly
50 per cent of GDP by 1979. Today that proportion is down to about 27 per
cent.
Howe was forced to clamp down on the private sector - which he did by
raising interest rates by two points and extending credit controls - in
order to finance the public sector without fanning the flames of inflation.
Lamont does not need to worry in present circumstances about an explosion of
private sector credit. Even so, it is impossible to reconcile the positions
of the two chancellors.
Thirteen years ago the Tories were entranced by the idea that the private
sector, once set free, would bound ahead. But the response in the early
1980s proved disappointing.
There was a certain amount of growth, but unemployment continued to rise
until 1986. Income taxes were slashed so as to improve incentives, yet the
economic benefits appear to have been disappointingly ephemeral.
It was only when Nigel Lawson abandoned monetary controls, devalued sterling
and cut interest rates that the private sector responded with any great
vigour. But it was a candyfloss boom which brought little permanent benefit
and which collapsed when anti-inflationary measures were applied.
The remarkable Conservative theory in the mid-1980s was that private sector
borrowing could not be inflationary. Deregulation led to an enormous
expansion of bank lending but the dangers were ignored.
Soaring house prices, in fact, were regarded as entirely desirable, and any
link with general inflation was ruled out. There was a kind of symmetry to
the Tories' approach: while the public sector debt burden rose declined
sharply during the 1980s the private sector debt mountain swelled
alarmingly, reaching 80 per cent of GDP by the end of the decade. It remains
dangerously out of proportion to the ability of borrowers to service it at
high real interest rates.
It did not begin like this. In fact the Conservative government made a lot
of good economic decisions in its early years.
Since 1985, though, policies have nearly all been disastrous: the
abandonment of monetary restraint, disregard for asset price bubbles,
slowness to react to the economic overheating and then the pegging of
sterling to the DM at the wrong time. Last year the government was sitting
around waiting for a phantom recovery. Now it is embarking upon a borrowing
binge which could impede the eventual recovery of the private sector.
Lamont should allow for the risk that the government will have to assume
responsibility for a large slice of private sector debt through bailouts of
financial institutions. Already it is propping up the market in repossessed
homes.
Immediately ahead of the election, unfortunately, the errors cannot even be
acknowledged, let alone responded to or corrected. Some day, perhaps, Tory
theorists will get around to working out how it all went wrong.
My own conclusion is that the deadly touch of the Treasury is at the centre
of much of it. It is not just that its forecasts have often been comically
bad.
More fundamentally, far too much emphasis has been placed upon centralised
economic policies. Even if these were executed properly - as they generally
were up to 1985 - they could not liven up the economy very much.
It must be time to downgrade the Treasury. And this is more than a question
of handing over responsibility for monetary policy to the Bank of England.
The whole idea of chancellors producing new ideas out of a red box every
year is flawed. In any case, within the EMS and the Single Market, monetary
and fiscal policy - even down to tax rates  - will increasingly be
determined by what the rest of Europe is doing.
The ministerial pecking order in Whitehall has to be revamped. The industry
and employment departments must become much more important centres for the
development of economic policy. But we must not expect the kind of miracle
which was proclaimed by the Treasury in 1988. Just a few good ideas will do.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Japan's outlook 'depressed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Japan yesterday dismissed calls to ease monetary policy after
its latest survey of business showed the weakest outlook in four years, with
profits and capital spending plans declining sharply.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, called for an early release of funds
for public works projects in an effort to stimulate the economy.
The central bank's quarterly survey of business, known as the Tankan, showed
a particularly depressed outlook for manufacturing industries. The index of
business conditions dropped 18 points from November to minus five in
February - the first dip below zero since November 1987 and the largest
quarterly decline since 1975.
The sharp deterioration will add fuel to the daily calls from political and
business leaders for an early cut in interest rates. The central bank's
official discount rate was cut by half a point to 4.5 per cent at the end of
December.
However, a Bank of Japan official said the bank saw no reason to alter its
monetary policy because of the survey and had not revised its view on
economic growth. The effects of the last cut in rates were still not fully
realised, he said.
The bank said inventories had grown more quickly than expected in the last
quarter of 1991.
Profits in the manufacturing industry, excluding oil refining, were expected
to fall 16.4 per cent in the fiscal year ending March 31.

FT  07 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome must be gratified to note that the week after the announcement of
the Wellcome Trust divestment has seen a drop in the company's shares of
only 9 per cent. Since the sale may triple the amount of stock in the
market, the reaction suggests there is something to the argument that
dealing liquidity has a value almost as great as that of scarcity. The
question is whether the future will continue so smoothly.
The Wellcome sale may be equivalent to a large privatisation, but there are
significant differences. In particular, the seller is not a government
anxious to curry favour with voters. The main interest of the Wellcome Trust
is to extract the best price from its holding, which hardly points to
discount deals yielding instant profit for small private investors.
That presumably means heavy reliance on overseas and UK institutional
investors. A tender system similar to that which operated for the recent BT
sale would establish a satisfactory clearing price for such buyers. But, in
the end, the price will be heavily influenced by demand from the US. Growing
signs of recovery there this week ought to mean investors will place a
diminishing emphasis on pharmaceuticals in favour of cyclical stocks.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BT's decision to accelerate job losses suggests it wants to hedge its bets
before the election. It looks as if it will increase its original target of
17,000 staff cuts this year by perhaps 50 per cent. In recent years, the
group has shed thousands of staff through natural wastage. The recession has
changed all that, not least because Mercury is no longer an avid hirer. Cuts
will now cost BT hard cash. At the end of last year, it still had Pounds
173m left from its 1990 provision of roughly Pounds 300m to cover job
losses, but that might be enough to make a mere 10,000 staff redundant. BT
will need further provisions.
That is where political calculation comes in. By taking the costs of job
losses earlier than planned, BT can reduce its embarrassingly high profits
by perhaps Pounds 200m. That might help keep a Labour government's attention
on the other privatised industries. Granted, BT's profits will be higher
again in future years, so it risks toughening its regulator's stance in this
year's review of post-1993 prices. It will also be adding to the
government's unemployment burden. But the strategy has the virtue of keeping
BT's options open. Were the Conservatives to win, the job losses could
always be trimmed back.
There was plenty of other pre-election jockeying among the utilities this
week. The water regulator quietly announced a longer-term approach to
pricing than hitherto implied by his sniping at the companies, and the
government completed the trade sale of Northern Ireland's electricity
industry. All that remains to be fixed is how far British Coal will supply
the domestic power market. That is the most intractable problem.

Unease over the political outlook was evident in the weakness of both gilts
and sterling this week. It was less clear in the equity market: the FT-SE
shed only just over 1 per cent in spite of a wave of rights issues totalling
well over Pounds 1bn in two weeks. Perhaps it helped that the news on the
dividend front was better than expected, while the rights issues were hardly
of the rescue variety so familiar last year. Perhaps equity investors have
given up trying to second-guess the budget and election and are looking to
the slightly longer term.
Whatever the size of the giveaway on Tuesday, the resulting PSBR will be the
floor for borrowing in 1992-3 regardless of who wins the election. Add in
the Pounds 11bn increase in public spending announced in the autumn
statement and a stimulative fiscal stance is guaranteed from the summer on.
That said, there is considerable short-term downside risk. The chancellor
may just pull off a vote-winning budget, but he faces an excruciating task.
Too much prudence in a recession could lose the election; overdoing the tax
cuts would be considered bribery. A false move in either direction could
undermine sterling, scuppering for good any chance of interest rate cuts.
That would certainly make this week in the equity market look like the calm
before the storm.

FT  07 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Virgin territory for Thorn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,533.1 (-5.2)
The music business has singed a few fingers in its time, as mid-1980s
investors in Thorn EMI, publicly quoted Virgin, and Chrysalis pre-takeover
will no doubt testify. Yesterday, though, all that seemed to belong to a
different era as the stock market responded to Thorn's acquisition of Virgin
music and accompanying Pounds 516m rights issue by marking the bidder's
shares 3 per cent higher.
It is certainly hard to fault any of the financial engineering. Thorn could
hardly have paid with borrowed money, given Virgin's negligible net assets
and the size of the necessary goodwill write off. The two-stage structure on
the new stock, moreover, looks attractive, given that payment of the
promised final dividend of perhaps 21.5p will likely coincide with the
second instalment in October. Regulators being what they are, it would not
be worth betting on the deal being cleared before late summer.
Even so, shareholders have to take a lot on trust to believe Thorn's claim
of quadrupled Virgin profits and earnings enhancement in year two. EMI,
admittedly, has managed to double margins since 1987. It deserves credit for
the strong position it has established in the US, and no doubt has a pretty
shrewd idea of the cost savings from bringing manufacturing in house and
trimming the artist list. Integrating Virgin into its extensive distribution
network will boost volume. Against this, what price a longer than
anticipated climb back from recession on both sides of the Atlantic?
It is easy to get carried away, too, by the valuations which Wall Street in
particular places on the music business. Applying the relatively sober 1.6
times sales which Thorn has paid for Virgin to Thorn's own music business
may suggest that UK investors are a bit grudging. But without any takeover
potential, or an imminent float, it is surely wiser to concentrate on an
earnings stream.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Sharp rise in US employment figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A JUMP in US payroll employment last month was seen by Wall Street analysts
yesterday as signalling a gradual improvement in economic prospects and a
reduction in the chance of another interest rates cut.
Employment in all sectors excluding agriculture rose 164,000 in February,
compared with analysts' expectations of a rise of only 10,000.
However, the politically-sensitive unemployment rate rose from 7.1 per cent
to 7.3 per cent, the highest level for nearly seven years. The unemployment
data are based on a survey of households.
The rise in unemployment, seen by political analysts as a key measure of
economic health, is embarrassing for President George Bush who is
campaigning in southern states ahead of the critical 11 Super Tuesday
primaries next week.
With the economy the central campaign issue, Mr Bush is trying to convince
disgruntled middle-income Americans that growth is about to resume after
three years of stagnation.
Financial markets, on the other hand, focus on the payroll employment
figures which they view as more reliable. The employment figures are based
on a survey of companies.
The sharp rise in non-farm employment, coupled with an increase in the
length of the average working week, was seen as reducing the chance of the
Federal Reserve easing monetary policy.
Indeed, many analysts now fear the Fed will have to push rates higher later
this year.
Mr Jim O'Sullivan, economist at J P Morgan, the New York bank, said the
employment figures indicated the 'worst was over', but cautioned that the
economic recovery was unlikely to be rapid. Morgan is forecasting growth of
only 1 per cent at an annual rate in the second quarter of this year.
The rise in payroll employment follows other mildly encouraging signs,
including stronger home sales and a slight improvement in department store
sales. Most analysts expect the economy to grow modestly in the second
quarter, but many fear the recovery will not be robust enough to give Mr
Bush a big lift in the election campaign.
The effect of the rise in employment was partly offset by a revision of
January's figures to show a drop of 149,000 rather than 91,000. Over both
months, the underlying trend was only slightly positive.
Much of last month's employment gain reflected a possibly erratic 133,000
increase in retail jobs, where seasonal adjustments are often unreliable.
There were also small gains in other service sectors such as finance and
real estate. Manufacturing employment was little changed after a 200,000
decline in recent months. Construction shed 30,000 jobs.

FT  07 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rise in Nikkei fails to
brighten sentiment
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo
WHILE movements in the Nikkei average were dominated by activity in the
futures markets, share prices remained mixed overall, construction issues
gaining ground against a weak high-technology sector, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed up 128.57 at 20,992.99, falling 1.6 per cent on
the week. The index fell to a low of 20,841.47 immediately after the opening
and then hit a high of 21,113.54 later on in the session.
Traders said that the Nikkei was not reflecting sentiment in the broad
market. A total of 122 issues fell to new lows since January last year,
dragging the Topix index of all first section stocks down 3.28 to 1,520.45,
the lowest since December 1986. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.55
to 1,157.30.
Volume fell to 250m shares from 300m. Declines led advances by 495 to 455
with 161 issues unchanged.
The market failed to react to the Bank of Japan's tankan - quarterly survey
of business sentiment - announced during the afternoon session. The survey
indicated a further fall in business sentiment because of the weakening
economy, especially in the manufacturing sector.
Traders said that the report was in line with expectations. Since Mr Yasushi
Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, was in Switzerland to attend a meeting at
the Bank of International Settlements, the earliest that the discount rate
could be cut was next week.
Market participants are now focusing on the outcome of a by-election this
weekend in the Miyagi prefecture, in northern Japan, for a seat in the House
of Councillors.
Construction and electrical engineering companies rose on speculation that
the government would bring forward the implementation of its public works
projects. Nishimatsu Construction rose Y40 to Y1,170 and Chudenko added Y40
to Y4,500.
Drug issues which were popular during the past week fell on profit-taking by
dealers ahead of the weekend. Mochida Pharmaceutical fell Y160 to Y4,000 and
Dainippon Pharmaceutical lost Y70 to Y1,900.
Blue-chip issues lost ground on selling by corporations ahead of the March
book-closing. Many companies had reportedly taken a decision to pull out of
stock investments due to heavy losses and the negative image of 'zaitech',
or financial engineering.
Hitachi fell Y25 to Y777, the lowest since the beginning of last year, and
Toyota lost Y40 to Y1,330. Traders noted light bargain-hunting by investment
trusts at lower levels.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 40.38 to 22,630.37 in volume of 101.5m
shares.
Roundup
FALLS in Hong Kong and Manila were the outstanding movements in the region
yesterday. In Bombay, brokers boycotted trading in protest against delayed
settlements, and amid rumours of a payments crisis.
HONG KONG slid as rumours that a senior blue chip was planning a rights
issue continued to circulate. HSBC Holdings, the parent of the Hongkong
Bank, Hutchison and Cheung Kong were all named as possibles as the Hang Seng
index fell 55.39 to 4908.90, 0.4 per cent down on the week in spite of
several record highs over the past fortnight. Turnover fell from HKDollars
2.54bn to HKDollars 2.29bn.
MANILA blamed the US market, uncertainty ahead of the May 11 elections and
politics in the electric power industry - after the country's out-of-court
agreement with Westinghouse Electric on a disputed nuclear power plant - as
the composite index tumbled 38.80, or 3.4 per cent to 1,118.81, 5.5 per cent
lower on the week.
TAIWAN's weighted index sank 45.45 to 4988.08, 0.9 per cent lower on the
week, with construction shares posting the biggest fall on the day.
SEOUL was lifted by financials and big manufacturing stocks as the composite
index rose 6.86 to 626.09, 1.8 per cent higher on the week, turnover staying
buoyant at Won 264bn, but but down from Won343.3bn on Thursday.
BANGKOK saw gains by banks and property companies after investors took
profits in finance issues. The SET index closed 6.80 higher at 807.65 in
turnover of Bt6.99bn.

FT  07 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Spanish equities await further cut in
interest rates - The peseta's strength in the ERM suggests that investors
will not be disappointed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS IN Spanish equities have enjoyed a gentle climb in values so far
this year, but any further progress is widely seen to be conditional on a
continued decline in interest rates.
The Madrid stock market, generally agreed to be undervalued, convincingly
broke through the 260 level 10 days ago. This was achieved on the back of a
cut of 25 basis points on February 25 that brought the Bank of Spain's
intervention rate down to the 12.40 per cent. Wall Street's record-breaking
advance also helped.
Having arrived at this rarefied plane, the index subsequently moved up to
266 before profit-taking eased it back slightly to close at 261.97
yesterday, a rise of 6.3 per cent so far this year, in line with the FT-A
Europe index.
There is a general consensus among market watchers that the timing and the
extent of a new rally will be dependent chiefly on whatever intervention
cuts the Bank of Spain may decide.
'Barring a stock market collapse in New York, the market is going to be
moved by interest rates - by those in Europe and by those in Spain,' says Mr
Salvador Garcia Atance, chairman of Asesores Bursatiles.
Mr Paul Farrow, head of research at the brokers FG Inversiones Bursatiles
believes that a fall in interest rates will mean a general, across the
board, revaluation of equities.
Predicting the next cut by the Bank of Spain involves the analysis of two
sets of data at this point. One concerns the usual domestic indicators, and
especially inflation and wage increase figures, and the other has to do with
the peseta's strength and the pound's weakness in the European Monetary
System's exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
There is not much in the domestic indicators that would recommend a cut in
interest rates in the immediate future. Inflationary pressures, particularly
underlying inflation, remain strong and an ill-tempered bout of labour
disputes in pursuit of sharp salary increases has preceded the annual wage
negotiations which will begin later this month.
A glance at the ERM, where the peseta represents a high ceiling and the
pound a low floor, nevertheless suggests that the Bank of Spain might be
forced to loosen its tight monetary policy for reasons which have nothing to
do with domestic economic considerations and everything to do with with
European good neighbourliness.
The difference between the pound and the peseta, which has recently widened
to 6.22 per cent and thus stretched the ERM band close to snapping point,
means that one or the other currency has to move. The Bank of England cannot
reasonably be expected to raise its rates ahead of the general election and
so the Bank of Spain may be forced to oblige by bringing the peseta down.
February's cut in the intervention rate was 10 basis points greater than
most analysts had expected and it was dictated by the pound's weakness. The
economy minister, Mr Carlos Solachaga, said at the time that the move sought
a 'more balanced situation' in the ERM and the current speculation is that
the minister could be repeating those very same words before the summer.
'Cuts are going to depend on the Germans and on the British,' says Mr Garcia
Atance of Asesores Bursatiles. 'We think it is going to be very difficult
for the rates not to ease by 10-15 basis points, perhaps by 25, over the
next two to three months.'
Confidence is on line because this long-term view is widely shared. 'Taking
a six-month view we are relatively positive,' says FG's Mr Farrow.
Market watchers are biding their time ahead of the next surge. In fact
Iberagentes, the Madrid broking house linked to Credit Lyonnais, is
recommending short-term selling. 'We had forecast a 260-265 index band for
the first quarter and now we think that it has peaked for the time being,'
says the brokers' deputy general manager, Mr Alvaro Villacieros.
Mr Stephen Hughes, the Spanish market analyst for Nikko Europe in London,
sees a period of consolidation before the the next resistance level of 270
is tackled and believes that, in the longer term, a rise to 285 is
achievable.
Societe Generale's broking arm in Spain is recommending utilities and
defensive stocks. 'Nothing much is likely to happen right now,' says Mr
Francesc Guardans, the company's chief executive.

FT  07 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses extend losses on
economic slowdown fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES mostly extended Thursday's declines yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff, as worries about interest rates on the Continent were joined by
concerns about European economic growth rates.
Some analysts took yesterday's drop in Germany as a correction. But Mr
Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at BZW, said that Europe did have
to consider the continuing slowdown in the German economy and the effect on
its neighbours.
'Our figure for west German growth this year is only 0.75 per cent, and that
requires a brisk upturn in the second half,' he said.
FRANKFURT fell by more than 1 per cent, the DAX index closing 18.85 lower on
the day and little changed on the week at 1,745.95. This followed a
midsession decline of 2.63 to 711.73 in the FAZ, up 0.3 per cent on the
week.
Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt, MM Warburg in Hamburg and James Capel in London
saw this as part of a brief correction before the DAX tested the 1,800
level.
But Mr Bell's Frankfurt colleague, Mr Jurgen Rothig, saw the market going
down in the near-term. Interest rates were going to stay at record high
levels for the foreseeable future and company earnings were poor, he said.
February inflation data yesterday from two key states, showing
month-on-month rises of 0.6 and 0.7 percentage points, were another bad
sign.
German shares are on a 1992 p/e of some 16 against 13 per cent for Europe as
a whole, according to BZW, not outlandish given the strong D-Mark and heavy
provisioning habits which keep earnings per share artificially low.
Volume fell from DM7.9bn to DM5.6bn yesterday as the Bundesbank's average
bond yield rose 3 basis points to 8.08 per cent. Yesterday's falls were led
by blue chips, Allianz dropping DM33 at DM2,425, Deutsche Bank DM9.50 at
DM727 and Daimler DM9 at DM765.
PARIS suffered from a bout of nerves after Wall Street's overnight fall.
Good US job data in the afternoon failed to lift spirits. The CAC-40 index
fell 6.13 to 1,966.91, down 0.8 per cent on the week. Absenteeism linked to
school holidays kept turnover at FFr2bn.
Elf fell for the third day in a row following the government's sale of a 2.3
per cent stake next week. Dealers expect the new stock to be priced at
FFr360 per share. The stock fell FFr4.90 to FFr365.10.
Alcatel was the most active stock, losing FFr3 to FFr614 on profit-taking
after its gains earlier in the week. Euro Disney was also active, picking up
FFr1.2 to FFr160.
Havas fell FFr5.90 to FFr495.10 on domestic selling while Air Liquide,
popular some weeks ago, added FFr11 to FFr760.
ZURICH fell on profit-taking ahead of the weekend. Further worries about
high Swiss interest rates hit banks and dragged the rest of the market
lower.
The all-share SPI index fell 10.2 to 1,136.7, down 1.1 per cent on the week.
Bearers in CS Holding led the active list and fell SFr40 to SFr1,990 in
spite of a 57 per cent jump in profits at Credit Suisse, its main
subsidiary.
Alusuisse bearers fell SFr21 to SFr877 after Russia cut aluminium export
tariffs for the fourth time this year. Earlier this week Alusuisse
attributed part of a 62 per cent 1991 profit slump to cheap aluminium
exports from the Soviet Union.
MILAN, predictably, fell yet again as parliament's failure on Thursday to
pass a modified car insurance reform weighed heavily on insurance stocks.
The Comit index fell 5.57 to 514.87, down 3.9 per cent on the week, in
turnover estimated at less than Thursday's L89.5bn.
In the insurance sector, Fondiaria fell L735 to L34,000 while Generali
closed L580 down at L29,900, reaching L29,700 in the after market.
Among banks, Banco di Roma and Banco di Santo Spirito showed a small
recovery after recent losses linked to their share-exchange plans.
AMSTERDAM closed mixed in moderate volume, with trading concentrated in
Heineken and Philips. The CBS Tendency index closed at 128.0, down 0.1 on
the day but up 1.1 per cent on the week.
Heineken closed Fl 10.40 up at Fl 177.00, just below an all-time high of Fl
177.50 hit earlier in the day, following news this week of a 12 per cent
rise in 1991 net profit and a bonus share dividend. Its smaller rival,
Grolsch, gained Fl 4 at Fl 196.
Philips closed 80 cents lower at Fl 187.20 on news that it was involved in a
refinancing package for its loss-making video subsidiary, Super Club. After
the close, Philips said that it was issuing new shares to finance a buy-out
of Super Club minority investors.
STOCKHOLM overcame an uncertain start and advanced in heavy trading. The
Affarsvarlden General Index rose 2.6 to 983.2, up 4.6 per cent on the week.
Turnover eased, but was still heavy at SKr533m after SKr554m.
BRUSSELS closed lower in slow trading ahead of the end of the forward market
account on Monday. The Bel-20 index closed down 7.55 at 1,215.02, up 0.4 per
cent on the week, in low turnover of BFr530m after BFr982m.
A big agency cross in Petrofina showed up on London's Seaq trading system; a
block of 260,000 shares changed hands in London, worth Pounds 47.5m and
equivalent to 1 per cent of Petrofina's share capital. Smith New Court was
said to have executed the trade. The stock eased BFr75 to BFr10,750.
COPENHAGEN saw DDL, the part-owner of Scandinavian Airlines System, put on
DKr400 to DKr2,860 following SAS's announcement on Thursday that it hopes to
sell its 40 per cent share in the Inter-Continental hotel chain, writes
Hilary Barnes. The CSE index put on 0.62 to 344.01.
ISTANBUL fell slightly after a quiet session. The 75-share index closed at
3,620.77, down 6.29 on the day and down 1.2 per cent on the week.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Appointments: Powell: pulling together
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Just over a week after National Westminster announced losses on its UK
lending portfolio of Pounds 1.45bn, word comes that it is setting up an
international advisory board headed by Sir Charles Powell, a non-executive
director of NatWest since October.
Diversionary tactics? No, says the bank; the project has been long in the
gestation. According to NatWest chairman Lord Alexander, the 11-member board
will be there to 'strengthen our capacity to interpret international
developments and draw the right conclusions for how we conduct our
business'.
Indeed, the project was Lord Alexander's idea, though Sir Charles says he
made most of the approaches. 'On the whole we had a very gratifying batting
rate. Where we didn't, it tended to be conflict-of-interest problems,' says
Mrs Thatcher's former foreign policy adviser. Conflicts arose mostly in
Germany where it is difficult to find a senior industrialist who is not
locked onto the board of several banks; the solution was chief executive of
Krupp, Gerhard Cromme.
Other board members include John Whitehead, former co-chairman of Goldman
Sachs, Howard Davies, controller of the Audit Commission, Paul O'Neill,
chairman and chief executive of Alcoa, and Peter Woo, chairman of Wharf
Holdings in Hong Kong.
'This is very much a working board which will meet in London,' Sir Charles
asserts, contrasting it with 'the chamber orchestra function' of a lot of
American equivalents - smart rather than functional.
Sir Charles himself gets his travel in other ways; he is an executive
director of Jardine Matheson, and on the board of at least three other
companies within that group.
*****
Scholes, the Cheshire-based electrical products company, yesterday announced
that its newly appointed group managing director Barrie Lawson had 'ceased'
his job with effect from 26 February.
Lawson joined the company less than two months ago from GPT, where he had
been director, telecoms systems. He had been in line to take over as chief
executive; Reg Harrington, who currently combines the roles of chairman and
chief executive, favours splitting the functions.
Scholes' finance director Bill Riches refused to comment yesterday either on
the circumstances surrounding Lawson's departure or the reason for the delay
in the announcement. 'The board are very very disappointed that things did
not work out. We went to extreme lengths to try to select the right man.'
Asked how Scholes intended to avoid a repeat performance, he said that was a
matter for the board to decide.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Supply disruptions boost zinc -
Week in the Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ZINC market has responded to further disruptions to supplies this week,
brushing aside yet another increase in London Metal Exchange stocks and news
that the Russians have sharply reduced export tariffs.
Three-month zinc broke through the Dollars 1,200-a-tonne level on Wednesday
when Grupo Minera Mexico said its zinc refinery had declared force majeure
on deliveries because of a strike. The refinery, which is in central Mexico,
was scheduled to produce 96,000 tonnes of zinc this year.
Last week Minero Peru's Cajarmaquilla smelter, which is the largest in Peru
and produces 93,000 tonnes a year, declared force majeure because of
problems with its power supply caused by a drought. Traders believed that it
was delivering up to 95 per cent of its orders, however. Late on Thursday
Minero Peru said the force majeure would be lifted next week.
Market sentiment was further boosted by news of a strike at Asarco's New
market zinc mine in Tennessee, which produced about 29,000 tonnes of zinc
concentrates last year.
On the bearish side of the equation Russia was reported yesterday to have
cut the export tariff on zinc. In addition LME warehouse stocks, which rose
by 3,050 tonnes on Tuesday, advanced by a further 2,875 tonnes yesterday to
a record 209,175 tonnes.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst with Ord Minnett, the London brokers, yesterday
described the fundamental factors in the zinc market as 'robust,' pointing
out that prices had increased by 10 per cent over the last couple of week's
in spite of the rising level of stocks and the threat of more imports from
Russia. Zinc - usually behind aluminium and nickel in any recovery - should
see an accelerated drawdown in stocks once the economic situation recovers
in the second half of the year, he suggested.
Cash zinc closed at Dollars 1,206 a tonne yesterday, down Dollars 10 on the
day but a rise of Dollars 20.50 on the week.
LME aluminium stocks have continued to climb inexorably to a new record of
1,130,825 tonnes, rising 4,325 on Tuesday and 11,450 tonnes yesterday. The
increase - mainly Russian metal  - was hardly unexpected, but the cash price
retreated to Dollars 1,278 a tonne yesterday, a fall of Dollars 20.50 on the
week.
The London gold market suffered a fit of the jitters early in the week
following the Indian government's weekend Budget statement proposing a
relaxation of a 22-year ban on gold imports. Monday saw the market
immediately retreat below Dollars 350 a troy ounce on Middle Eastern selling
before recovering to close Dollars 2.35 down at Dollars 350.85.
The Indian proposal would allow expatriates to import five kilograms of gold
in a bid to end smuggling, which has been the main source of supply. About
200 tonnes are smuggled each year, mainly through Dubai, in order to avoid
import restrictions.
Mr Andy Smith, analyst with Union Bank of Switzerland, said the situation
was reminiscent of 1990 when gold fell Dollars 23 an ounce on Middle Eastern
selling within seven days of the Indian budget. That year it removed
controls on the internal market, sending local prices down 10 per cent.
Mr Smith pointed out that,while the Indian proposals were an incentive to
buy in the longer term, in the short term many Middle Eastern suppliers were
facing reduced margins on their Indian sales and might be tempted to sell.
On Tuesday the Bombay gold market, re-opening after a holiday on Monday, saw
an immediate 5 per cent fall in prices.
Yesterday the London gold market closed at Dollars 349.70 an ounce, down
Dollars 3.50 on the week.
The coffee markets have continued to decline. The London May robusta coffee
contract closed at Dollars 803 a tonne yesterday, down Dollars 15 on the
week after having failed to sustain a rally as high as Dollars 844 on
Wednesday.
London appears to be taking its direction from the New York arabicas market,
which has this week been monitoring talks between Latin American producers
who have been meeting in Costa Rica to discuss ways of restoring economic
clauses to the international coffee agreement.
The countries at the meeting said they had lost Dollars 6bn in export
revenues since the International Coffee Organisation's export quota system
broke down in 1989. They will be seeking support from Brazil, the world's
biggest producer, which has yet to make up its mind over market support
measures for coffee.

FT  07 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities await the Budget account
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST day of the pre-Budget trading account in UK equities featured
significant activity in specific stocks as the institutions balanced their
portfolios ahead of Mr Norman Lamont's speech next Tuesday afternoon.
Traders were surprised by the disclosure of another fund-raising move,
although Thorn-EMI's rights issue call for Pounds 516m was well-received in
a market taking a favourable view of the group's purchase of Virgin Music.
Trading volume in equities remained high, although Seaq-reported deals of
538.4m shares slipped below Thursday's 608.4m. But traders maintained that
the all-important retail business total, which reached Pounds 1.1bn on
Thursday, probably declined yesterday; detailed statistics on retail
business for Friday's equity trading session will not be available until
Monday.
With the latest public opinion polls indicating that public ratings of the
Conservative and Labour parties remain close together, the stock market had
little definitive lead. The pound remained nervous in the wake of Thursday's
fall, with the sterling/D-Mark rate finally unchanged in London. Some
analysts in the City of London have now resigned themselves to the view that
the UK general election expected early in April will produce a 'hung'
parliament, with no political party winning an overall majority in the UK
parliament; this would imply the likelihood of an other general election in
the UK later this year, with a further period of uncertainty.
Government bonds steadied after two sessions of falling prices and recovered
about  1/8 of recent falls. But the bond sector remained nervous, reflecting
the growing worry over the level of Public Sector Borrowing Requirement and
the sudden downturn in sterling on Thursday.
The FT-SE Index closed 5.2 down at 2,533.1, having moved erratically between
2,542.7 and 2,528.6 during the session. The mood was helped in late dealings
by a fairly steady performance on Wall Street, which shed only 2.68 on the
Dow Average in early deals following the announcement of the US employment
data.
The pre-Budget account which closed last night has seen the Footsie drift
lower by 9.2 as investors have shown caution ahead of Tuesday's Budget
speech.
At least two trading programmes were identified in the London market. In
addition to busy trading in Thorn-EMI, which was bought strongly when the
stock at first gave ground on news of the Virgin Music deal, there was ready
institutional support for a number of other significant deals.
Retail business in equities has risen sharply this week as investment funds
have repositioned themselves ahead of Tuesday's budget speech.

FT  07 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Virgin deal welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Thorn EMI see-sawed after the leisure group emerged as
the successful bidder for Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Music Group.
Volatility in the shares increased as the market initially recoiled at the
prospect of a Pounds 516m rights issue but buyers then became increasingly
enthusiastic about prospects for a rapid expansion of Thorn's music
recording and publishing businesses.
Thorn shares, which have come under sustained pressure in recent days amid
hints that it was the front runner to acquire the Virgin businesses,
initially fell sharply from an overnight level of 770p, but then picked up
strongly to touch 811p before closing the session a net 22 higher at 808p.
Turnover in Thorn shares reached 5.5m, well ahead of usual levels of
activity.
Mr Peter Joseph at Smith New Court said that although the deal was 'a sound
strategic move for Thorn' he thought the group had 'paid a full price.' He
said there now looked to be little upside in Thorn shares over the next 12
months.
Ms Lisa Gordon at County NatWest was more enthusiastic about the deal; 'It
was struck at a sensible price and there is tremendous scope for margin
improvements with Virgin on board.'
SmithKline deal
Much of the early activity in the traditionally heavily traded
pharmaceuticals area of the market was confined to the two classes of stock
in SmithKline Beecham after large-scale switching between the two categories
of shares in the group .
SmithKline ordinary shares initially edged ahead to 904p before coming off
sharply and ending the session a net 7 lower at 900p while SmithKline units,
marked down from an overnight level of 4138p to 4100p at the outset of
trading subsequently rallied to close 13 easier on balance at 4125p.
Dealers said Salomon Brothers, one of the big US investment banks had
operated a switch, selling 4m of the ordinaries at 903p and buying a block
of 800,000 Units at 4135p, in a deal worth around Pounds 7m.
The uninspiring presentation at midweek to US institutions by Mr John
Browne, BP's head of exploration and production, continued to affect BP
shares which slipped 3 more to 262p. Turnover was 12m.
Oil sector specialists said there was no doubt that much of the hefty
American buying for the past two weeks had been triggered by hopes that the
BP director would deliver encouraging exploration news and confidence in the
group's dividend policy. Shell eased the same amount to 442p on 3.4m shares.
The BZW sell note on National Power and PowerGen exerted further downward
pressure on the stocks although both attracted considerable support at the
lower levels and closed above the worst. National Power, sold down to 217p,
rallied to end a net 2 off at 221p with a heavy 8.4m shares traded, while
PowerGen settled 3 off at 233p, after 229p, with 4.5m shares traded.
There was aggressive two-way business in the Scottish generators where
Scottish Power, on turnover of 6.8m shares, held at 103p and Scottish Hydro
ended the day slightly firmer at 105 1/2 p on 4.1m traded.
Political worries hounded the regional electricity and water sectors. The
Electricity Package lost 48 to Pounds 2800, responding to wide-ranging
losses among the sector's constituents.
Switching operations dominated activity in the banks. Abbey National, hit in
midweek by large-scale switching out of the stock into the big-four, where
many analysts see scope for recovery, rallied strongly and closed 7 firmer
at 293p. Barclays fell heavily to touch 363p during early trading, upset by
suggestions that the group may soon lose its premium debt rating, but later
picked up strongly to close 3 higher on balance at 370p as dealers took the
view that the recent bout of selling had been overdone.
A rise of 5 to 588p in Guinness bucked the general trend in the drinks
sector as rumours continued that Mr Warren Buffett of Salomon Brothers is
using his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway to build up a stake in the
company. It was suggested that he has sold part of his 10 per cent stake in
Coca-Cola to invest in Guinness.
Nervousness about the political situation weighed against the brewers in
general. Bass continued on a downward course, losing 6 to 542p, on fear that
the company's main operating arms will underperform.
Strength in the dollar supported food manufacturers such as Cadbury, up 6 at
466p, and Unilever, 4 higher at 946p. On the other hand Tate &amp; Lyle, with
its US sugar business was unchanged at 428p. United Biscuits eased 1 to 411p
ahead of next Thursday's results, on turnover of 1.1m shares. Analysts
expect the world's second largest biscuit manufacturer, after Nabisco, to
have increased profits to Pounds 206-210m in 1991 from Pounds 197.7m the
previous year. A rise in the dividend to 14.9p from 14.4p is also generally
forecast. It is hoped that increased overseas sales will offset a subdued
performance by the recession hit UK operations.
This week's proposal by Hillsdown holdings to float Fairview New Homes, its
housebuilding subsidiary, provided continued support, lifting the shares 3
to 168p. Dalepak retreated further, falling 5 to 385p, failing to sustain
the level of 433p seen on Monday when preliminary talks to buy part or all
of the company were announced.
Fear of a price war among do-it-yourself stores pushed Kingfisher down
another 5 to 521p, but WH Smith and Ladbroke, also involved in the DIY
business, through Do It All and Texas, gained a little ground. WH Smith 'A'
shares rose 2 to 465p and Ladbroke put on 3 to 232p. Analysis of the sector
by Credit Lyonnais Laing suggested that Kingfisher is the most exposed to a
price war. The investment house has downgraded its forecast of Kingfisher's
profits by Pounds 5m to Pounds 250m.
Profit-takers were seen at British Aerospace where the shares retreated 9 to
327p on turnover of 4.7 million. Sentiment was also affected by the view
that benefits from the anticipated Al Yamamah 2 defence contract may be
'further out in the distance'.
BTR weakened 6 to 390p in nervous trading ahead of next Wednesday's figures,
however TI Group which reports results on Thursday were wanted and the
shares firmed 7 to 627p.
Among pharmaceutical stocks, Medeva gained 6 to 288p after Goldman Sachs
recommended the stock on two year investment horizon. Mr Paul Krikler at
Goldman Sachs said 'the company has successfully built its position in the
US and UK and we can expect further moves into Europe in the coming years.'
A series of agency crosses was partly responsible for big gains in
Burnfield, 19 higher at 182p and Jones Stroud, 20 to the good at 230p.
The proposed massive job cuts did little for BT whose shares settled 2 off
at 334p on turnover of 6.7m; the partly-paid were 1 1/2 easier at 120 1/4 p
after 12m shares were traded.
Reuters, given a severe mauling in midweek after the failure in London,
Chicago and New York of testing of its Globex financial futures trading
system, dropped 11 more to 1159p, after 1156p.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TRADING in FT-SE futures was volatile with independent traders
'wrong-footed' by changing market direction writes Joel Kibazo. Dealers were
first caught out at the beginning of the session, after the March contract
on the FT-SE opened at a disappointing 2537 following the poor overnight
close on Wall Street. However buying from several houses soon left
independent traders short, triggering a squeeze which sent March forward to
2549.
Mid-session selling by the big institutions not only caused a retreat in
March but also left dealers with long positions which were only cleared as
market waited for Wall Street's opening. When New York came in lower than
expected, the March contracts once against turned south but the unexpected
turnaround on Wall Street again left locals in London out in the cold.
March closed at 2547, some 8 points above its estimated fair value premium
to cash of about 6. Turnover was just over 4,000 contracts. In LTOM trading
was lower Volume at 26,676 was down on Thursday's impressive 36,401. The
Euro footsie was the busiest option trading 2180 contracts. Amongst stock
options Hanson traded 1747 contracts, followed by Glaxo Holdings.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Appointments: A lady poised to develop her chamber
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Janis Bailey, who learned about business information systems with Hewlett
Packard in Palo Alto, California, is the new managing director of
Chambernet, a new Belfast-based electronic business information network
owned by the Association of Chambers of Commerce and 41 individual chambers
from around the UK.
Bailey, who accompanied her husband to California when he won a Fulbright
scholarship to Stanford, found on her return to Ireland in 1982 that there
were few interesting openings for her newly acquired skills.
So she took an MBA at Queen's, where she had earlier obtained a Diploma in
Library and Information Services. She joined Price Waterhouse in 1988 as a
senior consultant to develop marketing services.
Chambernet, to be launched in May, is designed to provide detailed
information on member companies' products, markets and personnel. Bailey,
who claims to 'quite like' living in Belfast, is excited to have found an
outlet for her business information experience, and is keen to develop
Chambernet via links with similar services in Europe, and possibly the US.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Rate hopes subside
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER busy day on the UK money market saw continuing jitters and
evaporating rate cut hopes prompt operators to take money back and reduce
their exposure risk.
Rates moved firmly into line behind a 10 1/2 per cent base rate, reflecting
widespread resignation that the long-awaited cut will not come next week, or
even before the general election, owing to continued sterling weakness.
Nervousness was fuelled by an opinion poll showing the Conservatives running
neck-and-neck with the
UK clearing bank base lending rate 10.5 per cent from September 4, 1991
opposition Labour party, threatening a hung parliament and a long period of
political uncertainty.
The three-month interbank rate was unchanged at 10 1/2 -10 3/8 per cent,
with the yield curve looking flat all the way to the 12-month end, which
eased  1/16 to 10 3/8 -10 5/16 per cent
The March short sterling contract firmed slightly to 89.60 down from 89.58,
while the June contract ended unchanged at 89.79.
Most market participants had cut their book right back, and were awaiting
Tuesday's Budget to re-assess the situation. This hampered the authorities'
efforts to relieve a large shortage - first put at Pounds 1,450m, and raised
to Pounds 1.5bn at midday.
The shortage, due mainly to treasury bills and maturing assistance of Pounds
1,239m and bills for repurchase worth Pounds 237m, apparently lay not with
the discount banks but the clearing banks, which can always cause problems.
The discount houses seemed to have contributed as much as they wished to in
the early round, when the Bank purchased only Pounds 10m of band 1 bank
bills outright at 10 3/8 per cent, and Pounds 200m for repurchase by the
market on March 26 and 27 at 10 7/16 per cent.
At midday, the Bank purchased only Pounds 207m of band 1 and 2 bank bills,
and Pounds 164m for repurchase.
In the afternoon, the situation improved as the Bank was able to purchase
Pounds 668m of band 1 and 2 bank bills outright, and provided late
assistance of Pounds 180m to take the day's total up to Pounds 1,429m.
This kept overnight rates around 11 1/4 -11 per cent, dropping to around 9
per cent towards the close.
German call money rates were unchanged at 9.60/65 per cent, but traders said
activity was hampered by strikes by some bank workers.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: More good news for dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar crept cautiously higher in late European trade yesterday after
rumours of intervention by the Bundesbank and Federal Reserve proved false,
and dealers turned their attention back to a surprisingly strong US February
employment report, writes Neil Buckley.
The dollar had opened at DM1.6685/95 but spent a nervous morning waiting for
the employment data, and later came under pressure as the Swiss National
Bank finally intervened against both the dollar and the D-mark to support
the ailing Swiss franc.
It rebounded to a DM1.6777 high when the non-farm payroll figure showed a
large increase of 164,000, higher than the most optimistic estimates.
At this point, the SNB was reported to have intervened once more,
concentrating this time on aggressive dollar selling. This sparked rumours
of wider intervention which knocked the dollar back to DM1.6570 before the
market realised they were untrue and the dollar began its upward climb
again. It closed at DM1.6695 in London.
Volatile trading in New York left it at DM1.6690 by midday.
'The payroll data were much stronger than expected and seemed to confirm the
view that the US economy is in the early stages of recovery,' said Mr Gerard
Lyons, chief economist at DKB International. 'The Fed now has little scope
for easing interest rates.'
In Japan, a disappointing Tankan survey provided more evidence of economic
weakness. The Bank of Japan is now widely expected to ease interest rates,
possibly after March 13, when the lower house is due to approve next year's
budget.
Efforts by Mr Hiroshi Yasuda, the deputy finance minister, to talk the
dollar down by warning of possible coordinated intervention by the G7
countries had little effect, and the dollar looks set to remain in its new
range above Y130. It closed yesterday little changed at Y131.75, from
Y131.85
The Swiss National Bank's intervention managed to strengthen the Swiss franc
against the D-mark from SFr0.9110 on Thursday to SFr0.9090 yesterday.
The Bank of Canada also acted to underpin its currency by raising its prime
rate by 75 basis points to 8.25 per cent.
In the EMS, the peseta went through its ceiling to 6.33 per cent above its
pivot against bottom-placed sterling, before slipping back to 6.23 per cent.
Sterling had another shaky day. It closed steady against the D-mark at
DM2.8700, but had earlier dipped below DM2.8660 to touch its effective floor
against the D-mark. Dealers said that only the threat of intervention around
that level moved the currency back up.
Against the dollar, sterling firmed very slightly to Dollars 1.7185 from
Dollars 1.7165 on Thursday.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE winning bidder for the Mexican bank Somex, which was privatised on
Sunday, has pulled out of the deal after key investors baulked at paying the
agreed price of Dollars 846m for nearly 82 per cent of the bank.
The move will not surprise too many observers of the Mexican banking scene.
The purchase price had been widely described as too high. It represented 29
times last year's earnings and was 4.6 times the bank's book value.
Mr Eduardo Creel, who headed the winning financial group, said some of his
investors had shown 'doubts with respect to the reasonableness of the bid
presented,' and his group would thus not make the first payment due on the
bank. Mr Creel and his team thus forfeits its deposit of 50,000m pesos
(Dollars 16.1m).
The finance ministry has awarded Somex to the second highest bidder,
investors from the brokerage Invermexico, who had offered Dollars 605m for
81.62 per cent of the bank, 21 times earnings, and 3.3 times book value.
In the past nine months the government has sold 12 banks in auctions for
30.75bn pesos at an average of 21 times historic earnings.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AKER, the Norwegian cement, oil and gas technology group, yesterday reported
a steep decline in profits before extraordinary items to NKr92m (Dollars
14m) from NKr632m for 1991 on turnover little changed at NKr13.6bn against
NKr13.4bn.
The group has been hit by losses in the oil and gas division, which suffered
a NKr300m charge for the loss of the Sleipner platform, plus a move into the
red by cement and building materials.
Of the total Sleipner charge, NKr150m represents a realised loss while the
remainder is a provision for future costs. 'Uncertainty continues to
surround the final financial outcome of the Sleipner loss,' Aker said
yesterday.
The oil and gas technology division net loss, before extraordinary items,
was NKr79m against a profit of NKr339m. However, its order reserve rose to
NKr13bn by the end of last year compared with NKr8bn at the end of 1990.
The division expects to increase turnover this year and is looking for a
significant recovery. Profits are expected to be better than those which
would have been recorded for 1991 before the Sleipner charge, the company
said.
Cement and building materials suffered a NKr79m net loss, before
extraordinary items, against a profit of NKr369m. The division saw staff cut
by 704 to 4,269 and capacity cut by 850,000 tonnes. The division expects
profits to fall further this year.
Included in group figures for 1991 is a NKr241m gain from the sale of Aker's
20 per cent stake in Noco, a small Norwegian oil company.
Aker has made organisational changes at Norwegian Contractors. the unit
responsible for the construction of Sleipner. Mr Jan Moksnes replaces Mr Ulf
Henriksen as managing director. Mr Tom Ruud, group president, takes over as
NC's chairman, replacing Mr Gregers Kure.

SAISON, the Japanese retail and consumer credit group, yesterday confirmed
plans to make the Inter-Continental Hotels chain a wholly-owned subsidiary
by acquiring the 40 per cent held by Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS).
The cash-strapped airline, which bought the stake for Dollars 500m two years
ago, was chosen as a partner for Seiyu, a Saison company, in the hope of
broadening the international appeal of the chain and to help finance the
cost of a refurbishment programme.
Inter-Continental, which Saison acquired for Dollars 2.15bn, has reported
operating profits for the last three years but financing costs have pushed
it into the red.
The hotel chain said that there will not be a sell-off of the group's
assets.

FT  07 MAR 92 / International Company News: Renault to raise fresh cash for
Agentina arm

RENAULT, the French state-owned car maker, is to raise fresh cash for its
loss-making Argentinian arm, to help it increase production for the South
American common market, due to come into effect in 1995.
The group currently owns 72 per cent of Renault Argentina, with the
remaining 28 per cent held by local private investors. It plans to inject
the 72 per cent stake into a new holding group, to be owned two thirds by
outside investors and one third by Renault.
The price of the shares, and hence the amount of fresh capital the exercise
will attract, has yet to be fixed, said a Renault official. Renault made
35,000 cars of the 200,000 sold in Argentina last year, by far its largest
market within the region.
It made a FFr330m (Dollars 59.13m) loss there last year, a legacy of the
high inflation that crippled Argentina until the sweeping economic reforms
of President Carlos Menem had time to take effect.
Renault officials stress that they have faith in the reforms, and that they
did not plan to restructure the group's business in Argentina. However, they
do not feel they can launch aggressively into neighbouring countries without
local partners.
The plan for a South American common market, or Mercosur, was agreed a year
ago between Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Para -guay.
They aim to curb trade barriers between each other and set joint rules on
anti-dumping, investment and intellectual property.

1991 fall to 11%

AN improved second half allowed Anglo American Industrial Corporation (Amic)
to restrict the decline in full year 1991 earnings to 11 per cent.
Profits at Amic, the industrial arm of the giant Anglo American group,
improved by 5.6 per cent in the second half following a 25.4 per cent
reduction in the first six months. Full year net earnings fell to R401m
(Dollars 139m) from R451m.
Turnover was 5.5 per cent higher at R6.46bn, but earnings at the operational
level were 24 per cent down at R434m. Income from associate companies and
investment and interest income also dropped.
Mr Graham Boustred, the retiring chairman, said the results reflected a
deepening domestic recession and further deterioration in world markets.
Of the main profit contributors, both Highveld Steel and AECI, the chemicals
company, were hard hit, with Highveld's attributable earnings dropping to
R96m from R150m while earnings at AECI dropped to R187m from R238m. Earnings
also fell at Boart International, a key supplier to mining markets, to
R48.2m from R66m.
Companies that managed to lift earnings included Mondi, the forest products
group, and Scaw Metals. Mondi's attributable earnings rose by 18 per cent to
R110m and Scaw lifted earnings to R84m from R78m.
Mr Boustred said the group was budgeting for a modest increase in earnings
this year. The 1991 dividend is being held at 350 cents per share.

sales advance

<TEXT>
ALENIA, the Italian state-owned aerospace and electronics group, suffered a
sharp drop in net profits to L56bn (Dollars 44.7m) last year from L97bn in
1990, despite a 15 per cent rise in group sales to more than L4,800bn from
L4,175bn in 1990, writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
At parent company level, the company only broke even last year after setting
aside L138bn in depreciation charges and provisions. As a result, the
dividend, paid by the parent company, is being cut to L60 a share from L90
the previous year - itself reduced from L130 in 1989.
Alenia blamed its earnings fall on the worldwide downturn in defence and
civil aviation orders, as well as adverse exchange rate movements between
the lira and the dollar. Despite the difficulties, the order book edged up
to L11,600bn last year from L10,500bn in 1990.
The group, which was formed from the merger in December 1990 of the Selenia
defence electronics concern and the Aeritalia aerospace business, has been
trying to slim down in response to the tougher business climate.
Staff numbers remained virtually static at around 30,000 last year. However,
last November Alenia reached agreement with the government and unions to cut
the workforce by about 3,000 over the next three years.

FT  07 MAR 92 / International Company News: Credit Suisse profits surge 57%
despite downgrading
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT SUISSE, still smarting from the loss of Moody's triple A rating in
January, has reported a 57 per cent surge in 1991 net income to SFr848m
(Dollars 556m), raised its dividend and forecast higher profits in the
current year.
Mr Robert Jeker, chief executive of Switzerland's third largest bank, said
the 'very satisfactory operational performance' re-established the long-term
earnings trend and showed that 1990's profit slump was an exception.
'We foresee a further increase in profits this year,' Mr Jeker said.
However, he warned that the very high level of provisions for bad debts in
1991 - SFr1.1bn, 61 per cent above the previous year's figure  - was likely
to persist this year because of weak economic conditions in Switzerland and
elsewhere.
Mr Jeker insisted that the downgrading of Credit Suisse's long-term debt by
Moody's was having no influence on the group's business. 'All analysts know
that our bank is solid and one of the best in the world,' he claimed.
Last year, group total assets rose 4 per cent to SFr155.6bn and
shareholders' equity rose 2.5 per cent to SFr8.4bn before the planned
allocation to reserves of SFr240m from 1991 earnings. Mr Jeker said the
group's capital adequacy provisions were SFr2bn in excess of the Swiss legal
requirement.
Capital problems centre on CS Holding, the company set up in 1989 to hold
Credit Suisse and most of its financial and industrial affiliates. The Swiss
Supreme Court has ruled that CS Holding must meet bank capital requirements
for all its subsidiaries. CS Holding plans to spin off up to 20 per cent of
the shares of Credit Suisse to help raise its capital reserves.
The restoration of the Credit Suisse dividend, to SFr23 per share after last
year's reduction to SFr20 per share, will also help.
Net interest income of the Credit Suisse group rose 14 per cent to SFr2bn
and commission income jumped 21 per cent to SFr1.5bn as investment fund
operations were buoyant. Trading income soared from SFr213m to SFr1.3bn,
nearly a third of it coming from interest rate instruments, mainly via the
London subsidiary, Credit Suisse Financial Products.
Mr Jeker said Credit Suisse's international operations contributed 34 per
cent of last year's gross profit compared with only 18 per cent in 1989.
'Even if we cannot extrapolate from this trend, it is nonetheless a strong
indicator that business is thriving in deregulated financial centres in
countries where market and operating conditions are optimal,' he said.

TRELLEBORG, the Swedish mining and industrial group, yesterday reported a 78
per cent fall in profits after financial items to SKr512m (Dollars 84m) for
1991, but decided to maintain an unchanged dividend of SKr6.50 a share,
writes John Burton in Stockholm.
The board proposes a one-for-five rights issue to raise SKr913m. The funds
would be used for investments in foreign mining operations as well as to
finance possible acquisitions.
Sales for the group fell by 15 per cent to SKr21.5bn, reflecting the
slowdown in the construction industry and weaker metal prices.
Mining units Boliden Mineral and Boliden International suffered losses of
SKr62m and SKr23m respectively.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Thorn EMI - Virgin: Down-to-earth ideas or flights of fancy?
 -Richard Branson's unrealised horizons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I'VE NEVER worked for a company that I didn't own and it will be a bit
strange.' Mr Richard Branson was adjusting yesterday to his new role as
president for life - but no longer owner  - of Virgin Music Group, which he
created 20 years ago.
His colleagues say that he had scarcely been involved in running the music
business for the past few years, and he agrees. Nevertheless, he concedes
the Pounds 510m sale was a wrench. But after 14 months of negotiations,
mainly with the winner Thorn EMI, and with interjections from the world's
largest media companies, his mind was clear.
Where does the deal leave him? For a start, about Pounds 380m richer, after
deducting the 25 per cent share of Fujisankei Communications, the Japanese
group which was a partner in the music business for the past three years.
The price marks a triumph in retrospect over the stock market's view of his
creations. He floated Virgin Music, plus the Megastores record shops at
Pounds 248m in 1986, but, battered by the October 1987 stock market crash
and the market's scepticism of Mr Branson's ability to deliver long-term
profits growth, the value fell to Pounds 142m.
In exasperation, he took the businesses private at the original flotation
price - three years later, Thorn has more than doubled his money.
But the deal also marks a turning point in his commercial life. Virgin Music
was the largest of the businesses he created and by a long way the most
profitable.
The main business he retains is Virgin Atlantic Airways, the airline he
created eight years ago. He also keeps the Megastores and several computer
games businesses.
The challenge he faces is whether he can grow those businesses to match the
music group's success, or whether, as his critics say, they will remain
expensive hobbies.
Mr Branson has fiercely denied that he was prompted to sell the record label
because the airline was in need of cash. Nevertheless, it did not escape
from the double hit of the Gulf war and fierce competition on transatlantic
routes. Last year Voyager Travel Holdings, the holding company for the
airline, saw its pre-tax profits cut from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 800,000.
Within this, Virgin Atlantic made a Pounds 3m pre-tax loss, after taking a
Pounds 6m profit on selling an aircraft. This loss was offset by a Pounds
3.3m profit on the tour operator linked to the airline.
Part of the squeeze came from winning the right last year to fly out of
Heathrow Airport, which brought heavy start-up costs - and head on
competition with British Airways and American carriers.
Although much larger, with hundreds of planes in their fleets compared to
Virgin's eight, these airlines have accused it of cherry-picking the most
profitable routes.
Despite this vigorous commercial and public relations battle, Mr Branson has
said that the airline could meet its immediate cash needs from its own
resources.
However he concedes that the airline needs more cash to fulfil his latest
dream - to apply for routes to Johannesburg, Los Angeles and Chicago, and to
take advantage of currently depressed prices to buy aircraft to fly those
routes.
To support these plans he has been negotiating to raise Pounds 55m by
selling a 20 per cent stake in the airline. Despite yesterday's deal, he
said: 'We've got a long way talking to two parties and it might be
embarrassing to drop the talks now. We'll always see partners as part of our
financing plans.'
For the same reason, he may continue to search for a buyer for a 20 per cent
stake in the continental record shops.
But however ambitious his plans for the airline and stores, they will only
absorb part of the sudden influx of cash.
His latest dream is to run upmarket business rail services along British
Rail's tracks, if the forthcoming white paper on rail permits this
competition. His vision is remarkably precise - all seats will have
seat-back video - although he emphasises Virgin has not begun detailed
plans.
He is, famously, not short of enthusiasm for new ventures, and yesterday's
deal has given him the money to try them out. The next few years will show
whether he can build a second half-billion pound business.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Thorn EMI - Virgin: The tough path to world leadership in
music - The strategy behind Thorn EMI's purchase of the Virgin record
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT for life is usually a title which company directors bestow on the
aged founder when he can no longer remember their names, or which Third
World despots bestow on themselves.
Thorn EMI has different reasons for keeping Mr Richard Branson on as
president for life of the Virgin Music Group, which, it announced yesterday,
it is buying for Pounds 510m. The first is sentimental. Mr Branson had
expressed a desire to retain his links with the music business and became
quite emotional when the deal was finally concluded in the early hours of
Friday morning.
The second is Thorn's recognition that its money is being spent on nothing
more than a group of music executives and the stars they have signed. Virgin
has no manufacturing or distribution facilities. The trick is to get the
stars to stay on, and Mr Branson promises to help.
The deal, which will bring Thorn such artists as the Rolling Stones, Phil
Collins, Genesis and UB40, catapults the UK music, rentals and light
fittings company into the first rank of world music groups.
Mr Colin Southgate, Thorn's chairman, says that before the Virgin deal his
company was the world's fourth largest recorded music group - with a market
share of about 14 per cent. The Virgin purchase should give the enlarged
group a worldwide market share of about 18 per cent, putting it alongside
PolyGram and Time Warner, the two world leaders.
In the ownership of music copyrights, Thorn, which has 800,000 titles -
including Singing in the Rain, Over the Rainbow and Happy Birthday to You -
is already the world leader, along with Time Warner. The Virgin purchase
adds another 25,000 titles, including the works of Fine Young Cannibals,
Tears for Fears and the Pet Shop Boys.
Mr Southgate will not be drawn on how important it was for Thorn to clinch
the Virgin purchase. Although the final deal was a considerable reduction on
the initial asking price of Pounds 800m, he does not want anyone to think
his eagerness led to him paying too much. Mr Southgate had, however, been
negotiating with Virgin for 14 months and his success in clinching the deal
against rival bids from Bertelsmann of Germany and other competitors was
crucial to the group's long-term strategy.
Since taking over as chief executive five years ago, Mr Southgate has sold
more than 60 companies - ranging from a computer chip maker to a television
set manufacturer - and rebuilt Thorn around two core businesses: the rental
of electronic and kitchen appliances, and music.
He has insisted there was no point in staying in an industry unless Thorn
was likely to be a world leader in it. The path to world leadership in music
has, however, not been an easy one. Mr Southgate has been forced to watch as
some of the world's last remaining independent record labels have been
snapped up by his rivals. Thorn was regarded as the front-runner to buy
Geffen, the US label, in 1990, but it went instead to MCA. Virgin was the
last of the large independents; had Thorn failed to acquire it would have
remained in the world music second division.
Although Mr Branson says he will help the enlarged group retain its
performers, he has had little to do with the day-to-day running of Virgin
Music. Of greater importance is the retention of Virgin executives such as
Mr Ken Berry and Mr Simon Draper. Both are staying with Virgin, which will
be run separately from Thorn's other music businesses. Mr Berry will have a
long-term contract with Thorn. Mr Southgate will not specify how long but
says it is longer than three years. Mr Draper will have a rolling contract
but with a clause restricting him from setting up in competition should he
leave Thorn.
An executive with a rival music company wonders how effective these ties
will be; the music industry is notorious for the temperamentalism of those
involved in it. 'In the case of the artists, it is going to be a matter of
money', the executive says. Virgin's deal with the Rolling Stones, concluded
last year, is thought to be safe. Virgin's payment of between Dollars 30m
and Dollars 40m (Pounds 22.7m) is believed to have been more than Dollars
10m more than the next highest bid. Mr Branson revealed yesterday that the
contract with the Stones provided for its continuance if Virgin was sold to
Thorn EMI. If Virgin had been sold to any other company, the Stones would
have had the right to renegotiate the deal.
Thorn believes that Virgin's profitability can be improved in three ways.
The prices of Virgin's products, which are slightly lower than Thorn's,
could be increased. Thorn will take over Virgin's manufacturing and
distribution when existing contracts expire. Mr Southgate says this should
add Pounds 20m to profits over the next two years.
He adds that the negotiations with Geffen taught him an important lesson
about the management of a music company's roster of artists. Geffen ran a
lean roster, dropping artists who were not contributing much or who were
past their peak. He believes the Virgin roster could do with similar
treatment.
Although the purchase puts Thorn at the top of the world music business, it
remains significantly different from the other leading groups. There are no
links between Thorn's music business and its other activities. The other
large groups see music as part of a larger, integrated business, taking in
consumer electronics and other media such as film.
PolyGram is 80 per cent owned by Philips, the Dutch electronics giant.
PolyGram announced last year that it would spend Dollars 200m expanding its
film interests. Time Warner has large film interests. Japanese consumer
electronics companies have invested heavily in both music and film. Sony
owns CBS Records and Columbia Pictures. Matsushita has acquired MCA and
Universal Pictures.
Mr Southgate dismisses the claimed logic behind these mergers and purchases
 -that there is an intimate connection between the development of new
consumer electronics gadgets and the music and pictures that are played on
them. Executives in rival companies also argue that the links between music
and film are becoming stronger and that leading artists are demanding a
presence in both.
Thorn is no longer involved in consumer electronics manufacture and Mr
Southgate argues there is no reason why it should be. If a consumer
electronics company is to succeed with a new type of music player, it needs
the support of the entire music industry - not just its own company. Sony
failed to make a success of its Digital Audio Tape (Dat) player, despite
owning CBS. 'The idea that you have to be a consumer electronics
manufacturer to own a music company hasn't got through to my thick skull
yet', Mr Southgate says.
He says, too, that film companies continue to approach Thorn for help with
sound tracks, even when they have a sister music company. 'The artistic guys
in the film business don't like to be told who to work with', he says.
A longer term threat to the enlarged Thorn music business is one which
affects the whole industry: the prospect of slower growth. World sales of
sound recordings doubled from Dollars 12bn in 1981 to Dollars 24bn in 1990,
boosted largely by the explosive growth of the compact disc. CD unit sales
in 1990, the last year for which data have been collated, totalled 770m, a
28 per cent increase on the previous year. The cassette tape, while still
the most popular format, is in decline, while the vinyl long-playing record
has disappeared in advanced economies such as the US and Japan.
Music company executives believe, however, that as worldwide household
penetration of compact disc players increases, CD sales growth will start to
slow. There are new musical formats on the horizon, such as the Digital
Compact Cassette (DCC), which looks like a conventional cassette but which
produces sound similar to that of a CD. Sony also plans to introduce a
miniaturised, recordable CD.
Mr Southgate dismisses the threat of a slower-growing CD market and says
Thorn is prepared to produce music in whichever new format proves acceptable
to consumers.
Others in the industry believe that slower sales growth, allied with the
huge fees demanded by world-class artists, could drive at least one of the
big music groups to the wall. By acquiring Virgin and increasing its
worldwide reach, Thorn has probably reduced the likelihood that it will be
one of the casualties.

FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: NatWest gives Swiss role in search for rich
pickings - The expansion plans of Coutts &amp; Co in a competitive market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS no shortage of bankers for the rich these days, especially in
Switzerland. But National Westminster Bank, through its Coutts &amp; Co
subsidiary, is making a fresh bid to become one of the leading companies in
this niche market.
Over the past two years, NatWest has reorganised its international private
banking activities, combining three subsidiaries into one new organisation,
Coutts &amp; Co AG, based in Zurich.
Mr Jean Pierre Cuoni, the Swiss banker who heads the operation, says one of
his main strategies for growth is to build on the NatWest customer base. 'In
theory, we should serve every NatWest client who becomes a millionaire,' he
says.
It was Mr Cuoni who encouraged the rationalisation of the NatWest
international private banking business. He was hired in 1988 to find a new
focus for Zurich-based HandelsBank NatWest, then a full service Swiss bank
which NatWest bought from Nestle in 1975.
The bank had been strong in corporate and securities lines, but the
prospects for a foreign-owned bank in these businesses in the late 1980s did
not look promising. Mr Cuoni, who had spent 28 years with Citicorp, mainly
in the private banking area in Switzerland, suggested HandelsBank should
concentrate on building up its private banking business.
'However, there were already Coutts' international operations and NatWest
International Trust Holdings in this field. It was hardly optimal to have
three managements, three brand names and three strategies going after the
same market.'
In a move that surprised many, NatWest announced early last year that it
would put all three in a new organisation under Mr Cuoni's control with
headquarters in Zurich, and 17 offices in other world capitals and tax
havens.
'Switzerland is still the centre of cross border international private
banking,' Mr Cuoni says, pointing out that the bulk of the money that flowed
out of the Middle East at the time of the Gulf war went to Switzerland.
He believes that the Coutts name and the Swiss knowhow will prove a winning
combination.
With more than Pounds 11bn under management, the group is closing on the
biggest Swiss private banks. But it is still far behind the big three
universal banks, Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corporation and
Credit Suisse in this area.
Profits are not disclosed but Mr Cuoni says, 'we are making good money'.
He acknowledges that Coutts is seeking to grow in difficult times. 'At the
moment, few big fortunes are being created. There are no great flows of
funds as there were in the 1970s. Within a few years, it will start to come
from eastern Europe, but now if you want to build your business, you have to
take market share from others.'
As a result, competition is getting much tougher. Mr Cuoni believes that
ultimately only a dozen banks will survive with a worldwide role in
international private banking.
'It is expensive to be in this business. You need extremely good investment
management products and technology, and that all requires heavy investment.'
Promotion too is expensive in this rarefied market. This year, the 300th
anniversary of the founding of Coutts, the bank will establish the Coutts
Art Foundation in Zurich to promote contemporary artists.
And what about suggestions that Switzerland is losing its attractiveness for
the rich of the world?
'I think there is an awareness here that the future battle will be won on
performance, not on the advantages of location. Still, Switzerland has a
head start, with something like half of the cross border private banking
business in the world.
'The Swiss are absolute market leaders in delivery of fast and error free
service. That is what the clients want, so I am fairly optimistic about
Switzerland as the epicentre.'

Net revenue for the year amounted to Pounds 10.25m (Pounds 10.97m), equal to
earnings of 7p (7.5p). A fourth quarterly dividend of 1.9p makes a 6.7p
(6.4p) total.
The board expects to pay quarterly dividends of 1.675p for the current year,
making a total of not less than 6.7p.

FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Jobs to go as receivers are called in at
Monotype
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONOTYPE CORPORATION, the typesetting systems company which is one of the
oldest names in the printing industry, has been put into administrative
receivership.
About 100 of Monotype's 300 employees in the UK have been made redundant at
the company's base in Redhill, Surrey.
The receivers, Mr John Talbot and Mr Anthony Brierley of accountants Arthur
Andersen, intend to keep the company's worldwide distribution network while
they look for a buyer for the business as a going concern.
Monotype provides integrated publishing systems. It produced the initial
hot-metal Monotype typesetting machine in 1893, and changed to
phototypesetting in the 1950s.
The company has an annual turnover of Pounds 30m, but said that after
unsuccessful attempts to reduce losses and obtain additional funding, the
directors had no alternative but to request its bankers to appoint
receivers.
Monotype was floated on the USM in 1986 and moved up to a full listing in
1988. In 1990 King Black Associates, a US-based investment group, paid
Pounds 34.2m for the company - topping an offer from the late Mr Robert
Maxwell.
Two of Monotype's UK subsidiaries, GB Techniques and Sinclair Imaging
Systems, are not in receivership - although the receivers are expected to
put them up for sale.

FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Trafalgar House court victory
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland &amp; Scottish Resources yesterday lost its appeal against Trafalgar
House in their protracted wrangle over the Ocean Emerald oil rig.
The Court of Appeal confirmed the High Court's ruling in January that
Trafalgar House can keep control of the rig, which its Davy division is
building, until it is able to draw on a Pounds 118m letter of credit with
the project's bankers or until it is paid in full by MSR.
Until the legal fight is resolved, former shareholders of Davy, which
Trafalgar House acquired last year, will get none of the Pounds 54m, or 45p
a share, second instalment for their shares from Trafalgar House.
Trafalgar House is planning to write to the former shareholders next week.
The rig was physically completed in December but a huge amount of
documentation and certification work has still to be completed before the
financial transaction on the rig can take place.

FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Company doctor for Lep if banks approve
refinancing plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID James, who is known for his corporate rescue work, is to become
chairman and chief executive of Lep Group, the freight forwarding and
security company, if its banks and shareholders approve a refinancing plan
involving a Pounds 180m debt-for-equity swap. Lep's shares rose 4 1/2 p to
14 1/2 p.
In the last two years Mr James has been involved in the financial
reconstructions of both Eagle Trust, the mini-conglomerate embroiled in the
Iraqi supergun affair, and Davies &amp; Newman, owner of the Dan-Air airline. He
expects to devote half his time to Lep.
Mr James said he was confident Lep's operating subsidiaries would survive if
the refinancing went through, though he would have to look at the strategy
for the parent company once he joined the board.
Lep's problems began to emerge a year ago when some off-balance sheet
property finance came on balance sheet and the company's debt rose to Pounds
400m. Last autumn Lep admitted that its debt had risen to Pounds 470m,
profits collapsed and a standstill agreement was signed with its banks. In
January Lep announced there would be substantial write-offs relating to its
property exposure and a debt-for-equity swap was suggested.
It is now proposing that Pounds 180m of its Pounds 530m debts should be
converted to equity. Details of the conversion have yet to be fixed but
given the company's market capitalisation of Pounds 20m the banks are likely
to end up with a substantial portion of Lep's shares.
There may be an opportunity for existing shareholders to buy some of the
shares issued to the banks. ADT, the security group, holds 27 per cent of
Lep's equity.
Interest payments would be deferred on about Pounds 130m of debt, and
facilities extended for another three years. Banks would also put in new
money to finance working capital.
A meeting of shareholders to consider the proposals is expected in May. Mr
James would take up his role after that.
If the plan goes through, Lep would retain National Guardian Corporation,
its US security business which was put up for sale last year in an earlier
attempt to cut its debt. Mr John East, finance director, said that Lep could
not find a buyer prepared to pay the price Lep wanted for National Guardian.
National Westminster Bank is head of the eight-bank steering committee,
which has agreed the refinancing in principle, and there are another 22
banks in the group.

FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Reduction for Maxwell pensioners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 4,000 Maxwell pensioners are to see their pension payments cut
after June this year. The pensioners may suffer falls in income of a half to
three-quarters.
These are the first people to be told of reductions in their pensions as a
result of the Pounds 450m shortfall in the various Maxwell pension schemes
discovered after the death of Mr Robert Maxwell, the publisher, last
November.
A similar number of people who have not yet retired will see the value of
their deferred pensions fall as well. The people affected are the 8,500
members of the Maxwell Communication Works Pension Scheme (MWS) who have
never worked for Mirror Group Newspapers. Another 2,500 members of the
scheme who have worked for MGN will not be affected.
MGN became responsible for the MWS scheme in 1989 when pension schemes from
nearly 90 companies, nearly all engaged in the printing industry, were
consolidated into one scheme. MGN became the 'principal employer' for the
scheme, although only about 800 of the members were working for MGN at the
time.
The MWS scheme had assets of Pounds 155m but a substantial proportion of the
schemes assets were diverted, leaving a small fraction of the total. Since
the losses were discovered MGN has been financing the pension payments.
However, MGN says it can no longer afford to finance these payments without
jeopardising the pensions of its own employees.
MGN said yesterday it would institute an appeals procedure and open a
telephone hotline for pensioners who feel they have been wrongly excluded.
The MWS scheme will continue to pay reduced pensions from its remaining
assets and any assets recovered will go towards making up those shortfalls.
MGN said pensioners would be entitled to the state guaranteed minimum
pensions.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Letter: Soft commissions provide a vital motive force in
stockbroking reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CLIVE SINCLAIR-POULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest your editorial on soft commissions ('Soft on soft
commissions', March 3).
Since Big Bang, commissions have been fully negotiable and so are set at a
level and a rate to meet the needs of the client. To ban soft commissions
would mean that such negotiating cannot take place and so abandon one of the
motivating forces behind stockbroking reform.
Soft commissions could be abused if the ultimate client was not aware of
their use. Under Securities and Investments Board rules, however, the
disclosure requirements are such that the client would be fully aware of
their fund manager's approach to soft and how much they used it. With
consultants now fully aware of the benefits of soft, they should ensure that
their clients are provided with full information. With these rules and
commercial disciplines in place disclosure is no longer an issue.
What you ignored is that some integrated houses' approach to soft
commissions has led to a potential abuse of another cornerstone of Big Bang:
best execution. That prompted SIB to question the integrated houses' ability
to achieve best execution and so the entire review of the strengths of soft
commissions and agency broking. By using an integrated house, fund managers
are locked in and have little independent control over the price they can
trade at. I believe that, without best execution, soft commissions should
not survive and that the integrated houses approach has been a cynical
attempt to use a weak definition of best execution to garner business.
You also ignore that benefits have passed on to the ultimate client. In
another Greenwich Associates survey, they showed that the average fund
management fee in the US (where soft is used much more) was 0.38 per cent,
while in the UK it is only 0.19 per cent. Soft commissions should be used to
control costs and so assist the ultimate client.
Finally, you ignore what should be the real questions raised by soft
commissions. Why are agency brokers used, and how do the 87 per cent of
commissions which are not soft benefit the ultimate client?

FT  07 MAR 92 / Letter: London fails to match Tokyo as a civilised city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From A P MOODY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I challenge Mr Colin Amery's statement ('A test for taste and
political judgment', February 24) that 'as a civilised city to live in,
London certainly scores higher than either New York or Tokyo'.
I will concede New York. In the absence of any universally agreed
measurement of 'civilised', I suggest that, when applying yardsticks in the
arts, science, culture, good government and, not least, the customs and
manners of its inhabitants, Tokyo is significantly more civilised than
London.
With regard to the first three categories (arts, science and culture) not
only by definition is Tokyo the most civilised city for its natural
inhabitants, the Japanese, but it also provides an ever-broadening array of
such activities serving the many constituents of its foreign community.
With the last two yardsticks, good government and the customs and manners of
its inhabitants, the interests of the local and foreign residents interlock.
Government provides a city that functions impeccably and the local
inhabitants observe standards of civility and courtesy that are largely
unknown in London or in any other city in the world.
Avoiding subjectivity, I suggest the most objective data possible on what
constitutes 'civilised' is a measurement of its opposite - that is, the
occurrence of violence between a city's inhabitants. The comparison between
Tokyo and London provides unquestionable proof that a higher level of
civilisation prevails in the former.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Letter: Bleak picture of Rhondda Valley leaves out local
vision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILIP J HEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Cassell's article ('Good vibrations in Birmingham, but who will
help Rhondda?', February 27) paints a bleak picture of the Rhondda Valley.
No one would argue that this area and others within the South Wales valleys
have their economic problems, the majority of which are the result of the
decline of the traditional industries of coal and steel.
However, it is important that readers see matters in context.
The Welsh Development Agency is responsible for what is Europe's largest
land reclamation programme.
Vast areas of the valleys, once scarred and redundant, have been brought
back to profitable use. By the mid-1990s, all major sites of dereliction
will have gone. Working with local authorities, and in some cases with the
private sector, the WDA is helping to create towns and landscape which will
make the valleys a more attractive place for investment. The policy is
already paying dividends.
So far this financial year, private sector companies have committed
themselves to invest Pounds 102.6m in 36 new or expansion projects in the
valleys - a significant increase on both counts on comparable figures for
the previous year.
These companies - even during a recession  - are demonstrating that the
valleys have a brighter future.
Our own faith in a rebuilt local economy is exemplified by - among other
projects - the ongoing construction of the first office accommodation we
have ever undertaken in the Rhondda. Fittingly, the 25,000 sq ft project is
under way on the landscaped site of old coal working at Clydach Vale.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Letter: Action groups at Lloyd's set out to assist, not to
destroy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From VAL POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read Tom Benyon's letter ( 'Lloyd's must be resolved without
bitterness, abuse and rancour', February 25) with interest.
It conveyed the welcome message of a desire to control forces which have
been let loose and, fanned by some sections of the press and an alliance of
cross-party politicians, threaten to get out of control.
The Association of Lloyd's Members helped to create action groups to assist
the loss-review inquiries in the discovery of the facts behind stricken
syndicates' losses and then possibly to pursue their rightful recovery
through the courts.
The apparent Outhwaite settlement confirms this course of action to be a
valid procedure, and the action groups cannot be blamed for using tactics
which they consider to be appropriate.
However, a word of caution: action group members presumably have no wish in
so doing to destabilise the Lloyd's institution and, in particular, to
destroy its customers' confidence.
To do that would surely raise the stakes to an unacceptably high level.
Action group members who feel that there is a risk of this should register
their views with their groups' committees.
Mutualisation is suggested as an alternative. The Lloyd's Council cannot
impose this retrospectively on the majority of Names; nor does the E &amp; 0
underwriters' agreement to an out-of-court settlement mean mutualisation by
the back door. That is the response of a relevant policy to a claim disputed
and subsequently settled.
If a substantial majority of Names feel that a solution to the current
crisis is through mutualisation, they must make their views known.
The sums are likely to be substantial, however, as I suspect the Task Force
has already discovered.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Letter: Fresh skills required when boardroom beckons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JACK SAVIDGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, At last, your article 'The boardroom beckons' by Charles Batchelor
(March 3) offers a potential board member practical insight into the
appointment process. Let me add a few items to Henry Short's 10-point plan.
These are drawn from the reality of serving as a non-executive board member
for more than 25 American private and public, high-tech and no-tech
companies.
The job is not easy: American litigators are just around corner, the toil to
facilitate change takes patience, and often the cross-cultures of the
boardroom are tedious. However, if we do it well, the share value for the
smallest shareholder will be increased. The coupling of effective directors
to management through the boardroom is the most under-utilised process of
our corporate world.
My additions to Short's list:
Understand the history and status of shareholder ownership.
Take steps to establish the business background of the existing board
members.
Negotiate your director fee before appointment.
Mr Batchelor says that a director 'should be informed' to participate at
meetings. The commandment I follow is: 'The director knew, or should have
known.' That really demands doing your boardroom homework.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Leading Article: What to do with tax cuts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW SHOULD canny FT readers respond to whatever tax cuts may be offered by
Mr Norman Lamont in Tuesday's budget? Should they spend the money, in
anticipation, or should they remain in a frugal state of mind?
Frugality would be much the wiser course, for three reasons.
Mr Lamont's budget will be one of two fiscal manifestos on offer, each of
which has, on recent polling data, an equal chance of being enacted;
the Labour version of the budget will be bad news for many FT readers; and
even the Conservative version may offer less than meets the eye.
The figures for next year will drown in red ink. Worse, that red ink will
stretch far into the future, even if the Treasury dares not say so. Both
sides will try either to explain or to forecast the prospective deficits
away. When presenting a forecast for the public sector borrowing requirement
in 1992-93 of perhaps as much as Pounds 30bn (5 per cent of gross domestic
product), before deducting privatisation receipts of Pounds 8bn, Mr Lamont
will point to the state of the economic cycle. Meanwhile, John Smith will
claim that Labour will 'borrow to build'.
Treasury forecasts will, no doubt, show declining public sector borrowing
requirements for subsequent years. Such forecasts should be viewed with
suspicion. The Treasury's forecasting record has been poor over the past few
years. Continued poor fiscal performance in the medium term must be deemed
quite likely.
Accept, for the moment, that the starting point will turn out to be a
deficit next year within spitting distance of 5 per cent of GDP. What are
the chances that the deficit will subsequently decline, without
discretionary tax increases?
Real growth
The government forecasts for the real growth of general government spending
between 1991-92 and 1994-45 were slightly over 3 per cent a year in real
terms. Everything suggests that this is likely to be an underestimate.
Since economic growth has been worse than expected, unemployment will be
higher. Public sector pay is being treated generously. Public spending plans
also always overshoot. Moreover, having permitted a Pounds 5.6bn increase in
the planning total for 1992-93 and a Pounds 13bn increase for 1993-94, by
comparison with plans presented a year earlier, Mr Major's government has
already shown itself to represent Thatcherism, minus tight control over
public spending. Meanwhile, Mr Smith represents a party that believes
passionately in public spending. He is unlikely to do better.
More fundamentally, pressures for more public spending are becoming intense.
Hospitals, schools, roads, public amenities, public sector pay, pensions,
childcare, child benefit, all clamour for attention. It took a torrid
economic expansion and the personality of Mrs Thatcher to stem the tide.
Neither Mr Major nor Mr Kinnock looks likely to do as well.
Revenue figures
Turn, then, to revenue. Here all depends on the prospective rate of economic
growth. If the UK economy is in a recession, with economic growth at faster
than trend rates in prospect, then there will be no problem. Revenue
normally grows faster than real GDP. The effect on the budget deficit is
particularly marked when growth exceeds trend, since unemployment-related
spending then falls. Should the economy grow at, say, 3 per cent a year from
now, then growth in revenue is likely to exceed the likely growth in public
spending.
Things are unlikely to turn out that well. The still deflated state of the
US economy, despite a discount rate of 3.5 per cent, holds a warning for the
debt-deflated UK economy where short-term interest rates are 10.5 per cent.
German short-term interest rates are likely to fall over the next year, but
a decline of more than a percentage point seems unlikely. Finally, the
interest rate differential vis-a-vis Germany is already at an historic low.
Should the trade deficit deteriorate and the credibility of the ERM
commitment be questioned, then the interest rate differential might rise
once more.
One city economist, Mr Bill Martin of Phillips and Drew, has estimated what
no economic growth in 1992, followed by growth of 1 3/4 per cent a year
between 1993 and 1996, might mean for the public finances. The conclusions
are sobering. Without adjustment of either taxation or spending, the PSBR
reaches 7-8 per cent of GDP by 1994 and stays at that level thereafter.
Gross public debt would exceed 60 per cent of GDP by 1996.
Labour might claim that the red ink was caused by increased investment. The
Conservatives might point to cyclical factors. Neither argument would wash.
A PSBR on anything like this scale would demand retrenchment. Tax cuts might
be on offer next week. A prudent tax-payer should view them as temporary,
whether advertised as such or not.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Man in the News: Former rebel with a pacifist cause - Alija
Izetbegovic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The route from Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, northwards towards
Croatia, is marked not only by road signs but by Serb Orthodox church domes,
Moslem mosques, and Catholic spires.
Despite the religious and cultural diversity of the industrial heartland of
Yugoslavia, there are few political slogans or flags extolling the Bosnian
parties representing these three communities. It is a world apart from the
other side of the River Sava, where flags proclaim the nationalism of
President Franjo Tudjman's ruling Croatian Democratic Union.
Unlike the neighbouring presidents of Serbia and Croatia, Mr Alija
Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of Bosnia, has refused to play the
nationalist card since winning office in November 1990. Mr Izetbegovic is
astute enough to know that nationalist symbols can divide, not unite, the
fractious communities over which he presides.
But holding Moslems (44 per cent of the 4.3m population), Serbs (33 per
cent) and Croats (17 per cent) together in a fragile peace has been put to
the test this week. Territorial ambitions by Serb and Croat nationalists in
Bosnia-Hercegovina have brought the republic to the brink of civil war.
Armed gangs of Serb extremists formed barricades around Sarajevo on the
pretext of seeking justice for the murder of a Serb at a local wedding. In
reality, they were protesting against the overwhelming vote for independence
from the rump Yugoslav federation by Bosnia's Moslems and Croats.
The sight of the barricades sent ripples of panic and fear through the
capital's bazaars - once ruled by the Turks, and later the Hapsburgs, and
where Serbs, Croats, Moslems and Jews have co-existed for centuries. But Mr
Izetbegovic, determined not to be intimidated by the Serbs, or provoked by a
younger generation of Moslems urging him to take a tougher line, adopted an
almost Gandhi-like, pacifist response.
After talks with Serbian leaders, and peaceful demonstrations, the
barricades were lifted. It was a telling example of how this once rebellious
writer's adherence to a philosophy of patience and tolerance can cool
tempers and defuse an explosive situation.
It would have been understandable had this small, soft-spoken, 66-year-old
writer and lawyer used his office to seek redress for present and historical
grievances against Moslems. In the mid-19th century, his ancestors were
expelled from Belgrade, capital of Serbia, after a constitutional clause was
enacted banning Moslems, Jews and gypsies from living in the city.
Mr Izetbegovic's grandparents settled in Samac, on the Sava, then moved to
Sarajevo. There, the young Alija, born in 1926, witnessed several Serbian
massacres of more than 100,000 Moslems during the second world war. At the
age of 20, he had a brush with the communist authorities for his political
activities, for which he received a three-year prison sentence. On release,
he completed his law studies at Sarajevo university, and worked as a legal
adviser for two large Bosnian enterprises.
In 1983, he was sentenced again - this time for 14 years, commuted to five -
for writing the 'Islamic Declaration', a political tract which sought to
reconcile European democratic principles with (Sunni) Islamic teaching. He
was released in November 1988 and founded the Moslem-based Party of
Democratic Action which won the most seats in the republic's first free
parliamentary elections in November 1990.
'He is aware of the bloody history of the Balkans,' says a close friend from
his university days. 'He knows that instability in Bosnia-Hercegovina has
always provided opportunities for satisfying the territorial ambitions of
Croatia and Serbia. Both have traditionally vied for influence and expansion
into this republic.'
That partly explains why Mr Izetbegovic has declined to side with either
Bosnia's Serbs or Croats. 'He tries to have good relations with both
communities so as to preserve the traditions of co-existence in Bosnia,'
says another government minister. Other officials argue that the Moslems
will be forced to seek their own state to protect themselves from Croat and
Serbian territorial ambitions.
Mr Izetbegovic rejects this idea. 'Our home is in Europe, and not in a
fundamentalist state. My aim is to have an independent, democratic republic
which conforms to European standards.'
His friends support this view. 'I used to think that Izetbegovic was
politically nave, that he would be trampled upon in such a way he would be
radicalised,' one of them says. Another friend says: 'I slowly realised that
he had a different sense of time, preferring to negotiate, rather than
react. He believes there is always a tomorrow, and that time is on his
side.'
Over the past few months, it often seemed that time was running out for
Bosnia's Moslems. President Tudjman and President Slobodan Milosevic, the
Serbian leader, have been fomenting instability in Bosnia-Hercegovina so as
to divide the republic among themselves, Mr Izetbegovic says simply: 'This
should not happen.'
At the same time, the federal Yugoslav army has been withdrawing from
war-torn Croatia and moving into Bosnia. The republic risks becoming a huge
garrison for discontented, mainly Serbian, soldiers who might be tempted to
side with Bosnia's Serbian population if there is an outbreak of violence.
Mr Izetbegovic is sanguine, however. 'We will talk to the generals. I am not
so sure that the army will side with the Serbs.'
This strategy of negotiation has paid off so far. This week, General Milutin
Kukanic, head of the federal army garrison in Sarajevo, declined to join the
Serb barricades.
Mr Izetbegovic is hoping, with the army on the sidelines temporarily and a
referendum to support him, that the European Community will recognise
Bosnia's independence. He believes this will prevent Croatia and Serbia from
trying to divide Bosnia and setting up cantons based on ethnic communities -
an impractical objective given the complex ethnic patchwork of the republic.
'Our independence must be recognised, and it must be backed by the
deployment of United Nations peace-keeping forces as soon as possible,' Mr
Izetbegovic said recently. So far, the UN is deploying 13,000 troops to keep
the peace in Croatia; only the administrative headquarters will be in
Sarajevo. 'If the UN forces were sent, the tension would decrease,' the
president says.
This weekend Mr Izetbegovic will again put his case for the recognition of

colleague of the president. No doubt, he will get a sympathetic hearing. But
it may be that that is all he will get.

FT  07 MAR 92 / In defence of his realm: George Bush is vulnerable on his
right flank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First there was Nelson Rockefeller, then Richard Nixon, briefly Gerald Ford
and last Ronald Reagan. For 25 years, these lions of the Republican party -
three presidents and one who might have been  - were George Bush's political
patrons. He served them well and was rewarded with posts from Beijing to
Langley, Virginia. Even when finally elected in his own right four years
ago, as qualified, by dint of public service, as any man ever to make it to
the White House, he did so principally as keeper of the Reagan flame in a
mean campaign designed by those who had long served his predecessor.
Now Mr Bush is on his own. He can blame Congress, Saddam Hussein and
Japanese food for his troubles, and he might even think privately that the
men around him are no longer lean and hungry. But it is his own presidency
he is defending, not somebody else's. It follows he has to define his
presidency - and therein lies the rub, because he is not doing it very well
in this election year.
He is mostly not doing it well inside his own party. This is less surprising
than it appears, for the challenger, Pat Buchanan, is, in his way, as much
party mainstream as the president. For, ever since Barry Goldwater's shock
troops howled down Nelson Rockefeller at the Cow Palace in San Francisco in
1964, the activist soul of the party has been on its right flank.
Goldwater was extreme enough - and beaten badly enough in 1964 by Lyndon
Johnson - for Nixon and Ford to keep the right at bay, though Reagan nearly
ousted Ford for the nomination in 1976. But, once Reagan was in office, the
hegemony of the right was not in dispute. The agenda was theirs, they licked
the envelopes, mounted campaigns and pushed through the sort of policies
that Mr Bush himself, when trying to thwart Reagan in 1980, once derided as
'voodoo economics'. Pat Buchanan now leads them and George Bush seems to
think that he cannot do without them. The trouble is that they neither like
nor trust Mr Bush; they never have, because he has never really been one of
them.
Yet it must be surprising that the president should be rendered so
vulnerable by a political tide which, no matter how pugnaciously swept along
by Mr Buchanan, surely has passed its national high-water mark. The country
may be angry, but there is no evidence it now wants Mr Buchanan's
alternative agenda. The public's plague is on all political houses in
Washington, not just the white one at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It is surely
no coincidence that the Democrats doing best in their primaries - Clinton,
Tsongas and Brown  - do not live in the nation's capital.
George Bush's problem seems to be that he does not quite know how to deal
with this. It might be thought that his coolness under pressure during both
the Gulf war and last August's abortive coup in Moscow would have taught him
some lessons. But the current approach is a frantic, frenetic defence of his
realm built more on the expediency of the moment than any sense of what he
wants to do or thinks is right. It is not so much the absence of 'the vision
thing' as what he offers instead that is sometimes alarming.
Thus, in confessing this week that he was wrong in 1990 to drop his election
pledge never to raise taxes, his principal justification was that he had got
a lot of political flak for doing so, and, ipso facto, must have been wrong.
His critics had a field day - 'flip, flop and flip' joked the Washington
Post. 'In a single utterance, he managed to tarnish his own good deed and
reveal an appalling lack of conviction,' declared the New York Times.
The willingness to cave in to pressure from special interests - as when the
fundamentalist right induced the president to get rid of the mildly liberal
head of the National Endowment for the Arts on the grounds that he condoned
pornography - is not exactly the principled George Bush Saddam Hussein came
to know and love.
His sometimes farcical attempts to reveal a common touch are threatening to
become the stuff of political legend, comparable to Jimmy Carter's epic
battle with a swamp rabbit. The fractured syntax even exceeds the worst of
Ford and Reagan and is becoming shrill. Mr Bush is being laughed at, not
with, always a dangerous sign for any politician.
There is another barely subcutaneous concern about the president, which is
the state of his health. He pursues politics, policies and leisure like
there is no tomorrow, but he only has to collapse one more time and what is
now politely called vulnerability may come more to resemble terminal
frailty. But none of those Republicans in the wings - James Baker, Dick
Cheney, Phil Gramm - can or will make a pre-emptive move. Dan Quayle does
not have to.
And yet, for all the actual and potential disasters and faux pas, Mr Bush
remains the favourite to win in November. Pat Buchanan cannot knock him off
the Republican perch and the Democrats cannot be certain they have yet found
the candidate to fly rings round him all over the country. Meanwhile, 'the
American people', invoked this year as in every election for their wisdom,
tolerance and nobility, wait, and wait, and wait.

FT  07 MAR 92 / MPs urge Army review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARMY CHIEFS are hopeful that the next government will reconsider the scale
of planned troop cuts after a critical report by MPs yesterday called for 'a
fresh assessment' of manpower requirements, David White writes.
Ministers have repeatedly warned that only a significant worsening of the
international situation would justify a change in plans announced last year.
The Commons defence committee said it feared the Army reductions - from
156,000 to 116,000 - had been 'taken too far' and might leave insufficient
leeway for the Army to deal with an unexpected crisis. Even peacetime tasks
might cause 'unacceptable strain'.
A particular source of concern was how units assigned to Nato's new Rapid
Reaction Corps would cope while being liable for six-month emergency tours
in Northern Ireland.
The committee, chaired by the Conservative MP Mr Michael Mates, said it did
not propose 'another major upheaval' on the lines of the Options for Change
review. The report called into question the way regiments had been selected
for merger or disbandment, and upbraided ministers for refusing to account
in detail for the rationale behind the decisions.
Senior Army officers believe it may be possible after the general election
to revise the target figure of 116,000 by several thousand.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Campaign for more support to aerospace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AEROSPACE industry, struggling under defence cuts and the downturn in
civil business, is launching a campaign to coincide with the start of the
general election to seek greater government support.
On Monday the Society of British Aerospace Companies will send a series of
briefing papers to potential parliamentary candidates from all parties
warning them of the plight of the aerospace industry and the repercussions
on jobs and technology in industry as a whole.
The society warns that aerospace industry employment will fall as much as 25
per cent - or about 44,000 jobs  - between 1989 and this year because of
defence cuts and the civil aerospace recession. It estimates employment in
its 240 member companies will fall from 194,000 jobs in 1989 to about
150,000 by the end of this year. 'Further job losses will take place in
small companies providing services and goods to the aerospace industry.'
A society official said yesterday that aerospace workers were voters in 340
constituencies. Of these, two thirds were regarded as among the top marginal
constituencies in the forthcoming election.
Sir Ralph Robins, the chief executive of Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine
group, yesterday stressed that the UK aerospace industry required the same
'level playing field' as rival aerospace industries, which were facing the
same pressures of defence cuts and a downturn in civil orders.
He told the Aviation Club of Britain: 'Some of our foreign friends receive
considerable help from their governments. Either we have to stop these
governments doing this or we must join them and help our industry in the
same way.'
The society is pressing for a closer dialogue between companies and
government to ensure that the UK maintains the optimum defence industrial
base and leading edge technological competence in spite of restructuring.
Among other industry demands are increased government investment in new
space and civil aerospace projects and the increasing of government launch
funds for civil aerospace projects to include components and avionics.
It says the government should support aerospace companies considering
investment outside their traditional activities.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Current account deficit cut to Pounds 4.4bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER THAN expected invisible earnings in 1991 cut Britain's current
account deficit to Pounds 4.4bn, the smallest annual shortfall since 1987.
Provisional figures released last month put last year's current account
deficit at Pounds 5.8bn, but hefty revisions in the fourth-quarter figures
led to yesterday's improved figure which compares with a Pounds 15.4bn
deficit in 1990.
The current account deficit in the fourth quarter of 1991 was revised down
to just Pounds 642m from an earlier estimated shortfall of Pounds 1.6bn. The
surplus on invisible earnings, which cover trade in services and various
financial transfers, was revised up to Pounds 1.9bn from Pounds 900m. The
invisible surplus for 1991 as a whole was Pounds 5.7bn.
Although the Treasury welcomed the 'sharp recovery in invisibles',
economists were more cautious, pointing to 'unsustainable' features in the
fourth-quarter figures that reflected one-off changes rather than underlying
improvements in the economy.
Much of the improvement to the invisibles balance in the fourth quarter
stemmed from lower government payments to the European Community. The UK
government received a payment of Pounds 500m back from the EC in the fourth
quarter so that the UK's overall payments to EC institutions dropped from
Pounds 1.6bn in the third quarter to Pounds 1.1bn in the fourth.
There was a big jump in earnings from interest, profits and dividends within
the invisibles balance to Pounds 1.1bn, from Pounds 599m in the third
quarter.
However, economists said this was another potentially unsustainable figure.
Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist at the Nomura Research Institute, said the
sharp increase in net interest income from overseas was the result of a fall
in the amount of profits paid to overseas investors which in turn reflected
a fall in UK profits last year.
Further breakdown of the invisibles showed that the surplus in services,
such as banking and insurance, shrank to Pounds 1.3bn in the fourth quarter
from Pounds 1.5bn in the third.
The Central Statistical Office said the smaller surplus was mainly a result
of a poor performance by Lloyd's, the London insurance market.
Overall exports of invisible items totalled Pounds 28bn, down from Pounds
28.8bn in the third quarter. Imports totalled Pounds 26bn, down from Pounds
27.7bn in the third quarter and down from Pounds 29bn a year ago.
A break down of capital flows showed that UK investment overseas slowed.
However, inward investment increased with a strong uptake of government
bonds.
The balancing item, which represents the discrepancy between the current
account deficit and recorded capital flows into Britain, was a record Pounds
14.7bn

FT  07 MAR 92 / Nigeria government braced for test over exchange rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S military government braced itself for its toughest test since
taking office in 1985 as the official rate of the naira fell from 10.6 to
17.8 to the US dollar.
The central bank set the rate for the last time yesterday. From Monday it
will be implementing Thursday night's decision to let the naira float, but
yesterday's fixing has already closed the gap between the official and
parallel rates.
This meets one of the main conditions of a new stand-by agreement with the
International Monetary Fund currently being negotiated in Lagos.
The current IMF agreement, due to expire in April, was effectively suspended
in mid-1991 after the government slipped from agreed economic targets.
A new agreement would pave the way to further rescheduling of Nigeria's
approximately Dollars 30bn external debt.
Both the business community and western creditor governments have been
stunned by the boldness of the government decision.
'It was a coup de theatre and the IMF was in the audience,' commented one
astonished western diplomat.
At this week's foreign exchange auction, now discontinued, the country's 120
banks bid for Dollars 407m at between 12.75 and 14 naira to the US dollar.
The central bank said yesterday it would sell at 17.8 naira, and gave the
banks until close of business on Monday to follow through their bids or
reduce the amount of dollars sought.
Most banks will have to cut back their applications, particularly in the
light of the liquidity squeeze government is expected to introduce. Bankers
had expected the central bank to conform to past practice and establish the
rate within the range of bids.
Praise from abroad for the government's action will be tempered by
continuing concern at levels of public expenditure, particularly on
large-scale projects such as the Ajaokuta steel complex and the on-going
construction of an aluminium smelter complex.
At home, many Nigerians are greeting the devaluation with a mixture of
incredulity and anger. Local press reports, based on a government briefing
two weeks ago, had led them to believe government would take steps to
strengthen the naira.
Anger stems from the belief that there will be a sharp rise in the cost of
living.
Government officials say any rise will be modest. The majority of
manufacturers pay for most of their imports and raw materials with foreign
exchange bought above official rate, and consumer prices already reflect
this. Locally grown staple foods will hardly be affected, say officials.
Candidates in the elections for a civilian president, due to take place at
the end of the year, are unlikely to come to the military government's
assistance.
Many have promised a return to a 'realistic rate for the naira', conjuring
up the oil-boom era of the late 1970's when the naira was worth more than
one dollar.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Price rises threaten wages row in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES are still rising in Germany despite slackening economic growth,
threatening to exacerbate the gathering confrontation over wages between
employers and trade unions.
Hesse and Bavaria, two of the country's economically most important regions,
reported an acceleration in inflation rates for February. In Bavaria, the
annual rate was 4.7 per cent (4.3 per cent in January). In Hesse, it was 4.6
per cent (4.1).
These high regional rates do not necessarily mean the overall west German
inflation rate, which stood at 4 per cent in January, will be at these
levels. The more heavily-industrialised state of North Rhine-Westphalia
reported a rate of 4.3 per cent for February.
While inflation has been picking up, economic activity is hesitant. The
economics ministry said west Germany's manufacturing order inflow rose 5 per
cent between December and January, but the combined level for both months
was down by 2.9 per cent on the previous year.
Industrial production figures showed a similar trend, rising in January over
December by 6 per cent but falling on a two-monthly basis by 1.2 per cent on
the year.
The February unemployment figures were also mixed. In west Germany, the
total eased 11,640 to 1.86m people, a rate of 6.1 per cent against 6.3 the
previous month. But the improvement mostly reflected mild weather.
In east Germany, the jobless rate was down to 15.9 per cent, or 1.29m
people, from 16.5 per cent (1.34m), helped by government job-creation
programmes.
In spite of the slackening economic situation, wage claims have been high. A
moderate 4.9 per cent settlement was reached for Ruhr coalminers yesterday,
but this came as no surprise, in view of the difficult state of the
industry.
Public-sector workers are holding out for 9.5 per cent after an offer this
week of 3.5 per cent, while banking unions have called members out on strike
to back their claim of 10.5 per cent against the employers' 5 per cent
offer.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Kohl faces double challenge on Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government yesterday faced a twin onslaught on its efforts to win
clear parliamentary approval for European economic and monetary union (Emu):
from the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and the Bundesbank.
Responding to a groundswell of public concern about the prospect of 'losing
the D-Mark' in a future single European currency, the SPD revealed plans to
demand a full parliamentary debate and decision on Emu, before a single
currency is introduced - either in 1997 or 1999.
Mrs Heidemarie Wieczoreck-Zeul, the SPD spokesman on Europe, said the debate
should also consider whether the European Parliament had really been
'substantially strengthened' in its powers.
The move by the SPD, whose support for the EC treaties is essential to
obtain a two-thirds majority for the related changes in the constitution,
would be tantamount to giving the German Bundestag virtually the same
'opt-out' right as that obtained by Britain during the negotiations at
Maastricht.
It goes much further than the move already mooted in both houses of
parliament, the Bundestag and Bundesrat, that they should be given another
chance to 'take stock' of the treaties before the final phase of Emu -
without any power to stop the process.
Mrs Wieczoreck-Zeul said there must a declaration by the Bundestag, attached
to the ratification of the EC treaties, that there would be no 'automatic'
move from phase two to phase three of Emu.
The SPD tactics are likely to be finalised by a meeting of the party
leadership on Monday, but they do stop short of the outright rejection of
the EC treaties advocated by Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the deputy leader and
premier of the Saarland.
His hostile attitude was roundly criticised yesterday by many party members,
who remain overwhelmingly committed to the goal of greater European
integration.
Instead, the Bundestag would demand the right to reconsider whether the
convergence criteria for currency stability had been met by all
participating countries.
Meanwhile Mr Otmar Issing, a leading board member of the central bank,
yesterday said the Emu treaty might not provide adequate safeguards for
future monetary and price stability.
Mr Issing, head of the Bundesbank's economics division, said it was
'questionable' whether the rules on budget discipline would be strict enough
to ensure monetary stability.
'This aspect, and the question about the relationship between monetary union
and political union, should be dealt with more thoroughly at a later date,'
he said, implying, like the SPD, some need for re-negotiation.
Any such move would be fiercely opposed by the German government, whose
staunch defence of the treaty was spelt out on Thursday by Mr Horst Kohler,
state secretary in the Finance Ministry and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's leading
adviser on international economics.
Mr Issing also warned that it seemed 'almost impossible' for Italy, Greece,
Ireland and Belgium to comply with the rules on state debt and public sector
deficits, necessary to join Emu, 'in the foreseeable future'. That might
mean strong political pressure to relax the rules, thus endangering the
stability of the system.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Bush looks to South Carolina for crucial lift to his
campaign: Even in one of the president's best states, his advisers warn they
may be unable to cut Buchanan's share of the vote to below 30 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR years ago South Carolina gave a crucial lift to Mr George Bush on his
road to the presidency.
The southern Atlantic state, home of the late Mr Lee Atwater, Republican
party chairman and Bush campaign manager, produced for Mr Bush a primary
victory over his main challengers, Senator Robert Dole and Mr Pat Robertson,
the revivalist preacher.
Later, in his general election battle against Governor Michael Dukakis, Mr
Bush won 62 per cent of South Carolina's vote, one of his highest scores
anywhere.
Today, Mr Bush needs an even more emphatic victory as he seeks an early coup
de grace over his outspoken right-wing challenger, Mr Patrick Buchanan.
The Bush campaign no longer has Mr Atwater to guide it, but it still has the
vigorous support of Governor Carroll Campbell, South Carolina's dominant
politician.
Mr Campbell also spearheaded Mr Bush's campaign in the neighbouring state of
Georgia, where Mr Buchanan won 30 per cent of the vote in last week's
primary. Even with the behind them, Mr Bush's advisers are warning they may
still be unable to cut Mr Buchanan's share of the vote below 30 per cent.
But Bush campaign officials also acknowledge that, with Governor Campbell's
strong backing, South Carolina ought to be one of the president's best
states.
Campaigning this week in Columbia, South Carolina's state capital, Mr Bush
declined to attack his rival by name. But he cautiously criticised the
protectionist theme Mr Buchanan has emphasised in his campaign. Closing the
US's borders to trade could put 125,000 export-oriented jobs in South
Carolina at risk, Mr Bush warned.
In the textile mills around Greenville and Spartanburg, however,
protectionism may win Mr Buchanan some votes. Senator Ernest Hollings, South
Carolina's Democratic senator since 1966, has long advocated textile import
quotas.
Senator Hollings has recently taken to Japan-bashing in a remarkably
tasteless fashion: responding to Japanese politicians who called American
workers lazy and illiterate, he noted that these same American workers had
produced a bomb and tested their handiwork at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
President Bush has refused repeated invitations to condemn Mr Buchanan's
overt appeals to racial politics. This reluctance may have little effect in
today's primary, but in the November general election it could cost him the
support of black voters, who make up 30 per cent of South Carolina's
population and who helped re-elect Governor Campbell in 1990.
Mr Buchanan, however, will have to share the racist vote with Mr David Duke.
South Carolina is the first state in which the former Ku Klux Klan leader's
name is on the ballot. Mr Duke's campaigning has been lackadaisical,
however, and he is not expected to win a big share of today's vote.
Mr Bush is competing with Mr Buchanan for South Carolina's large Christian
fundamentalist population. In 1988, one Republican primary voter in three
identified himself or herself as a born-again Christian.
Both Mr Buchanan and vice-president Dan Quayle have campaigned at Bob Jones
University, the Protestant university at Greenville, and Mr Buchanan has
made hay with a Treasury move to make churches submit lists of large donors
to the Internal Revenue Service.
Among the Democratic candidates, Governor Bill Clinton is expected to repeat
the formula with which he won Georgia's primary last week: strong
endorsements from local politicians, an overwhelming majority of black
voters, and a strong appeal to lower and middle-income whites.
Senator Tom Harkin, however, has sought votes in South Carolina's industrial
areas, and campaigned in the state last week with Mr Jesse Jackson, who
swept the Democratic caucus here in 1988 with 55 per cent of the votes.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEWLY-CREATED 10-nation Council of Baltic Sea States ran into
difficulties yesterday when Estonia and Latvia raised the controversial
issue of the delay in Soviet troop withdrawals from their territories.
The problem arose despite the insistence by Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Danish
foreign minister and conference co-chairman, that the council, set up to
bridge the gap between western Europe and the former communist states
bordering the Baltic, should not duplicate the work of existing
international organisations.
Security matters fell outside the scope of the new organisation, he
stressed.
That did nothing to deter the Estonian and Latvian foreign ministers, Mr
Lennart Meri and Mr Janis Jurkans, from protesting against what the former
described as the 'illegal stationing' of Soviet troops on their territories.
They did so in the presence of Mr Andrej Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister,
whose country is among the founder-members of the Baltic Sea grouping.
'At a time when the cold war, or rather, the third world war, is approaching
its end, Estonia is still fighting her last battle of the Second World War,'
Mr Meri said.
He did not see why Soviet forces, redeployed from Germany and other central
European states, were now concentrated on the Estonian border, in Karelia
and the Kola Peninsula.
At a time when Estonia was rebuilding its democratic institutions, Mr Meri
said: 'It is not a comfortable situation when our parliament can be reached
in less than 15 minutes by Soviet paratroopers'.
After the meeting, Mr Kozyrev tried to turn the discussion to his advantage
by stressing that Soviet troop withdrawals from the Baltic states and
elsewhere were as much a social and economic problem as a political and
military one.
The resettlement of soldiers' families was worthy of financial aid from the
council's member countries, he suggested.
Another Russian-backed proposal, to appoint a special commissioner for
national minorities and human rights in the Baltic Sea region, aimed
specifically at protecting Russian minorities there, also appeared to
trespass on work already undertaken by the 48-nation Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE).
Even protection of the marine environment, in which the Baltic Sea states
have a special interest, is already covered by an existing organisation, the
Helsinki Commission, grouping most of the states making up the new Council.
The Baltic Council, which will meet at foreign minister-level once a year,
and be run by officials in the intervening period, will not be given a
specific aid budget.
The aim is to identify common projects to help transform Russia, the east
European states and the Baltic republics into free-market societies and
prepare them for closer relations with the EC, but aid will continue to be
given bilaterally or channelled through existing international bodies.

FT  07 MAR 92 / Major defends Tory record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major, the prime minister, will today set the stage for the most
closely fought British general election since 1974 by launching a vigorous
defence of the government's economic record.
With a final draft of his party's election manifesto completed late on
Thursday night, Mr Major will tell a Conservative local government
conference in London that the average citizen's lifestyle has improved
immeasurably over the past 13 years.
His stress on increased prosperity since the Conservatives' took power will
be backed with figures showing the sharp rise
in young people taking up places in higher education and the spread in
ownership of consumer durables across the population.
But the Labour opposition yesterday seized on BT's plans to cut 25,000 jobs
to put rising unemployment under the political spotlight in the run-up to
next week's Budget.
At a hurriedly-called Westminster news conference, senior frontbenchers
called on the prime minister to take 'the urgent action necessary' on
training, jobs and investment.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade secretary, said 125,000 jobs had been lost
since the New Year and independent forecasts now showed 400,000 more were at
risk.
Mr Major is expected to highlight the government's education policies and
its new national lottery scheme, announced yesterday, as fresh evidence of
its determination to extend choice and improve the quality of life.
But the speech to some 300 Tory councillors is not intended to herald the
general election campaign, now thought most likely to be announced on
Wednesday - just 24 hours after a tax cutting Budget. His rallying call to
the party is expected to come at Torquay next Saturday when Mr Major
addresses the Tory Central Council.
Government ministers were last night welcoming new figures showing a sharp
reduction in Britain's current account deficit last year to its smallest
annual shortfall since 1987. However, City economists were treating the
figures warily, claiming the downward revision from a provisional Pounds
5.8bn to Pounds 4.4bn was the result of 'unsustainable' features that
emerged in the fourth quarter of last year.
Labour's warnings come as part of the opposition's strategy to 'box in' Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, as he puts the finishing touches to what is
thought certain to be a tax-cutting budget.
Labour strategists believe that even if the Budget were to include many of
the measures the Opposition has been demanding, the government is vulnerable
to attack for failing to act earlier.

FT  07 MAR 92 / The FT Schools 500 (7): A tale of two schools - Spot the
differences between similar institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE face of it, St Edward's School, Oxford and Sedbergh School, Cumbria
are distinguishable by little but location - the first abutting a city
centre, the second on the edge of the Lake District in northern England,
nothing but dales in sight and 40 miles from the town of Lancaster.
Both are middle-ranking public boarding schools; both were built by the
mid-Victorians (though Sedbergh was founded in 1525). They each have about
500 pupils, are organised into seven or eight houses, and have virtually
inter-changeable staffs.
Both charge boarding fees of around Pounds 3,400 a term, and their living,
sports and cultural facilities are comparably modern or modernised. They
operate a similar public school regime of prefects, chapel, house matches,
compulsory games, and compulsory Combined Cadet Force training for younger
boys. Their headmasters were even recruited from the same stable -
Winchester.
Yet the differences between the schools are marked, and reverberate across
boys' public schools as a whole.
St Edward's decision to admit girls to its sixth form in 1983 is the most
obvious divergence: they now make up a third of its sixth-form, with their
own boarding house but otherwise fully integrated. Sedbergh has set its face
firmly against going co-ed. Roger Baxter, its headmaster, is convinced 'it
was the right decision for us - by doing nothing we have found a niche.'
Girls do not seem to have wrought too dramatic a change in the ethos at St
Edward's. They comprise less than one-eighth of the school and, being mostly
recruits from private girls' schools, they were breathing much the same air
long before arrival.
It is arguable that Sedbergh compensates by having a far broader social mix
than its southern counterpart. A richer foundation, it pays up to a third of
the fees of 35 per cent of its pupils, and takes five assisted places pupils
a year. About a third of Sedbergh's intake comes from the state sector
(compared with 2 per cent at St Edward's), and the school has a boarding
house for 50 11- to 13-year-olds to facilitate the transition.
Undoubtedly, however, girls have strengthened the sixth form at St Edward's
 -in size (250), appeal and academic results (an average A-level score
mid-way between B and C).
David Christie, the school's ebullient Warden (headmaster), insists: 'We are
less elitest than the likes of Winchester, and proud of it'. But he is
ambivalent about the concept of 'value added'. 'The words imply a stuffing
process, rather like pate de foie gras', he says: what matters is not the
value schools add to exam results, but rather the contribution they make to
broader pupil development - 'enrichment', in the jargon. 'Education needs to
be seen as a whole process: league tables reduce it to exam passes.'
Sedbergh gains less glamorous, but respectable, A-level results: its average
pass is just below grade C, and 83 per cent proceed to higher education (90
per cent at St Edward's).
'You need to weigh that against the breadth of our intake', says Dr Baxter,
a former university lecturer. His sixth form is small - 150-strong - with
only a tiny post-16 entry. A sixth-form centre is under construction to make
A-level pupils less house-bound, but the isolation still needles some. 'If
we didn't have two girls' schools nearby, life would be pretty unbearable',
says one sixth-former.
Nonetheless, Sedberghians are proud of being 'up north' - 'none of those
southern, pale namby-pambies up here' - and with no competing independent
schools nearby, isolation offers other attractions besides the Lakes.
About 80 per cent of St Edward's pupils come from within an
hour-and-a-quarter's drive of the school; a majority of Sedbergh's hail from
Cumbria and North Yorks, but a large minority live farther afield. Dr Baxter
regularly visits prep schools three and four hours' drive away: 'it's a
competitive market, and you have to keep cultivating old ties these days.'
Tradition - and traditional values  - are more powerful forces 'up north'.
St Edward's has an almost cosmopolitan feel. It is not just girls, the city
and a more fluid entry: chapel is largely voluntary, and Christie talks of
the school's 'basically Christian outlook' in the same breath as provision
for Moslems and Buddhists.
Only a tiny proportion of pupils had fathers at the school. By contrast, at
Sedbergh about a seventh of the intake are sons of past pupils, and most of
the sixth formers asked seemed intent on sustaining the link with their
offspring. Two of the seven housemasters are Old Boys: 'the first place many
Old Sedberghians show their fiancees is Sedbergh', remarked the wife of one.
The house system is stronger than 'down south'. All meals are taken in the
houses; housemasters recruit many of their pupils directly; they also run
their own budgets - with staffs of 20 or 30 each.
Independent education is big business. Both schools have annual budgets in
excess of Pounds 6m a year, and both are engaged on large-scale capital
projects. Sedbergh is building its new centre; St Edward's is about to
embark on a Pounds 6m development plan, complete with appeal director.
With five reputable private schools nearby, St Edward's has the competition
on its doorstep. But Dr Baxter feels no more secure from the pressure up
north. 'If as many in the south looked north, as in the north looked south,
we would be flooded, of course', he is quick to add.

FT  07 MAR 92 / The FT Schools 500 (5): Bridging a great divide - A monk
engaged in worldly-wise debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IDEA of a Benedictine monk presiding over the country's principal
independent schools forum may leave you a trifle apprehensive. But a few
minutes in the company of Father Dominic Milroy, headmaster of Ampleforth
College, North Yorks, and chairman of the Headmasters' Conference, puts paid
to any such secular prejudice.
Father Dominic, 59, was educated at Ampleforth, England's premier Catholic
boarding school, and has spent almost all his life since teaching there.
Narrow-minded is, however, the last adjective to describe him: he is more
engaged in - and engaged by  - the contemporary education debate than many
of his wordly-wise public school colleagues.
'I do not think it would be right for schools to exempt themselves from
public quality control,' he begins, complimenting the FT on the scope and
approach of its survey of independent schools. He dismisses any idea that
institutions will distort their admissions because of league tables. 'No
self-respecting head would do that.'
His concern is not about what such tables reveal, but about what they - and
attempts to quantify 'value added' - are incapable of revealing. 'We are not
just about A levels, however weighted, but about forming adults - people
able to concentrate, able to live balanced lives, resolving clashes between
work and family, and able to discern what is good and what is less good.
'Schools should be environments for growth first and foremost: a pupil's
true achievement should not only be at school, but in the future', he says,
adding: 'Many of Ampleforth's great heroes are boys who would not have
passed the 11-plus.
To Father Dominic, future relationships with the state sector are top of the
private school agenda. 'The independent sector has increasingly been
thinking with the maintained sector', he says. 'The trend in education, as
elsewhere, is towards a mixture of the old kind of welfare state economy
with the freedom of individuals to control their own budgets and
expenditure.'
He sees the assisted places scheme - under threat from Labour  - as 'one way
of preserving the complementarity of the two sectors'. But he identifies
others - such as Kenneth Clarke's plan for teachers to be trained in schools
across the two sectors - and sees such policies as 'natural and to be
encouraged.'
Doing his own bit to bridge the divide, he is active in the Secondary Heads
Association - 'the mutual respect is increasing all the time'  - and is
chairman-elect of the Conference of Catholic Secondary Schools and Colleges,
which spans the two sectors. 'We are all heads basically concerned with the
same things: and we all rightly see our own schools as special.'
In any case, he adds, an improved dialogue is important not just across the
public/private divide, but between independent schools themselves.
He recognises, though, that the British boarding tradition is 'a very
peculiar phenomenon', with an uncertain role beyond the 1990s. 'There is
much less of an automatic option for boarding than there was', he says, but
sets this against the fact that those who do opt for boarding 'are generally
far more committed than before - and take the decision with their son or
daughter. The large boarding schools are pretty sophisticated and enriched
establishments - quite able to adapt as they need to.'
The net effect? Possibly decline, he concedes, although it is difficult to
tell how much of the current pressure is recession-driven. In the longer
term, 'it depends in part on how the advantages of boarding are perceived in
a society that is increasingly mobile and unstable in family terms.'
Father Dominic is similarly ambivalent about the future of co-education,
greeting the FT's findings on the academic strength of single-sex schools
with a wry smile.
'In many schools, co-education is still in an embryonic stage, but we won't
be racing to join them,' he says, pointing to the traditions behind schools
like his.
Which brought us back to the FT 500. Father Dominic recalls that his
predecessor at Ampleforth was once asked what happened to the boys that did
not do well at school. 'Oh yes, they usually end up employing our scholars',
came the reply.

FT  07 MAR 92 / The FT Schools 500 (6): A mission beyond grades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALL AT the wrong number for your Harley Street doctor, and you might
stumble on a few hundred boisterous schoolgirls by mistake. They are the
pupils at Queen's College, London, packed into a terrace of 18th-century
houses slap in the middle of the prestigious lane of doctors and dentists.
It is an unusual school from the inside, too. Elegant plaster mouldings
adorn modernised science labs. The decor seems to pass most of the pupils
by. But the day school's 400 girls relish the location ('just off to Oxford
Street shopping', blurted one sixth former), and the higgledy-piggledy lay
out seems to work. Regent's Park, around the corner, is the school playing
field.
Founded in 1848 by F D Maurice, founder of the Christian Socialist movement,
Queen's was one of the first schools with an avowed mission to to provide
'higher' education for girls. 'We were ahead of our time, and in some ways
still are', says Lady Celia Goodhart, the college's principal.
Queen's marries high standards with a degree of informality unusual for an
independent school. There is no uniform ('perish the thought', says one
teacher), few rules besides those requiring attendance and participation,
and very easy relations between the staff and the 420 pupils.
Lady Goodhart has no thought of going co-ed. 'The demand for girls' schools
is strong, there is plenty of evidence that girls - particularly those
aiming for higher education - perform better in single-sex schools, and
anyway admitting boys would do little to advance our mission.'
Lady Goodhart's unusual career path typifies the school. She taught there in
the 1960s, and returned two years ago after bringing up a family and
spending a decade in the higher reaches of the now-defunct SDP. 'I am just
getting into my stride,' she says, 'and have plenty of ideas for putting us
firmly on the map.'
Judged by A level performance, Queen's ranks towards the bottom of the FT
table. It is also fairly expensive (Pounds 4,500 a year). That is a feature,
perhaps, of its comparatively low pupil-teacher ratio (9.3:1) - a problem
bedeviling small schools in the day as much as the boarding sector.
Even so, most pupils go on to higher education, and the school is confident
that, given its intake, it would perform well in any 'value added' test. The
deputy head's use of tables comparing A levels with GCSEs and entrance-exam
scores are inconclusive, but persuasive.
As in most girls' schools, the bias against straight science is marked. But
Queen's tries to encourage girls to keep maths and/or one science going
after GCSE. With some success: more than half do so, 'and I hope to see that
number rise further', says Lady Goodhart.
The school gives every impression of life and vitality: its common room
appears easily the match of its more prestigious counterparts, and it
maintains a steady entry into Oxbridge.
The school therefore serves as a warning: life, purpose and real achievement
are certainly not lacking at 323 in the FT 500.

FT  07 MAR 92 / The FT Schools 500 (4): Fees: the lesson is, start early -
How parents can fund the heavy burden of charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST YEAR'S Budget recognised the difficulties families face in paying
independent school fees.
It produced two concessions - National Savings Children's Bonus Bonds, and
Friendly Society Baby Bonds - which added to the opportunities to save
tax-efficiently on behalf of children.
These measures were overdue. School fees inflation over the last decade has
consistently been around double the rate of increase of the retail prices
index, and the FT's new survey gives no reason to expect this to change.
Saving could be sustained while the economy was growing, but now parents are
feeling the pinch.
This can be seen particularly in the high rate of surrenders of the life
assurance policies which are frequently used as savings vehicles to pre-pay
for school fees.
Anthony Murrell, director of the school fees consultant Fraser Marr, reports
that his own company has seen as many surrenders in the last year as it had
in the previous ten put together. The cause, he says, is rooted in the
consumer boom of 1988. 'Just as people took out mortgages at cheap rates and
now find they cannot afford them, so they also started commitments to pay
for school fees plans. They are being abandoned as well.'
The increase in fees has led to an improvement in the technology used to
plan for their payment. Advanced software programs now include up-to-date
records of the fees currently charged by all the independent schools in the
country.
You can then feed in different projected rates of inflation. Murrell
suggests, in the light of school fees' ability to out-distance inflation,
that you should project inflation of 10 per cent, even if you are confident
that RPI will stay well below this.
'Baby bonds' allow you to save up to Pounds 18 per month on behalf of a
child, with a friendly society. The fund in which it is invested pays no
tax, and the lump sum when the bond matures (after at least ten years) is
also untaxed. Several friendly societies have very competitive investment
records, making this an attractive way to help save for school fees.
National Savings Bonus Bonds are arguably even better, particularly for the
risk-averse. They allow you to invest up to Pounds 1,000 on behalf of a
child aged under 16 at the outset, and guarantee a compounded annual return
after five years of 11.84 per cent.
Programs can also recommend the amounts of money you will need to put into
the various tax-efficient vehicles now on offer to meet your school fee
requirements.
If you have just started a family, and want to start out on the road to an
independent education, you have a number of routes. Three basic sources of
income are open to you: income, capital, or as a last resort, a loan.
Paying out of income
You will probably have to start when the children are very small. The
standard life assurance route, rich in commission for advisers, means that
you should start at least eight, and preferably ten years before the first
fees need to be paid.
This allows time to take out a 'qualifying' endowment policy, which attracts
top-rate income tax relief on the lump sum payable at the end. The proceeds
of the endowment then meet the fees, possibly after being put into an
annuity.
Endowments offer a sum 'guaranteed', and the life cover they provide is also
helpful when planning for children. But they have the disadvantage of being
inflexible. If you have difficulty keeping up the premiums on an endowment,
Murrell suggests that surrender should be your last option. Options he lists
include:
Making the policy 'paid up' - you do not add to the money in the endowment,
but wait for the amount you have already amassed to mature in the usual way.
This can offer a decent return.
Selling the policy to a marketmaker - this normally gives you a better rate
than an insurance company surrender value, and is useful if you need cash
quickly. Borrowing against the policy - many companies offer competitive
loan rates of around 12 per cent. This allows you to complete the endowment,
although it can drastically affect the maturity value.
Taking a premium holiday - if you have chosen an office with a sufficiently
flexible contract, this is probably the best option, provided you are
confident your income will pick up again in the near future.
A regular unit trust savings scheme, held in a Personal Equity Plan, would
set you free from all these complexities. This is free of both income and
capital gains tax (unlike an endowment), and is likely to produce superior
growth. The case for using it, at least as a supplement to an endowment, is
strong.
Paying Out Of Capital
This is an option only if you (or more likely your parents) happen to be
wealthy. Capital schemes make most sense if started early, and take
advantage of tax concessions for charities by paying into an educational
trust. The trust must be made out in the name of one child, but can be paid
out to any school at a month's notice, so it can accommodate moves between
schools.
The schemes certainly cannot be described as risky, as they use life
assurance funds to grow to the fixed required level of fees. Once the lump
sum has been paid, it should increase in value until the first fees have to
be paid. Then the insurer will purchase an increasing annuity, which pays
the fees each year.
Royal Life and SFIA (the School Fees Insurance Agency) both offer these
schemes, while similar plans are available from Equitable Life (complete
with an ambitious range of annuities) and Save &amp; Prosper.
All make life much easier by removing the hassle. Usually the insurers will
write out the cheques to the schools, so you can pay your money while the
child is infancy, and need literally never bother about school fees again.
Using A Loan Scheme
In the current climate this does not look appealing. But if you have made no
prior plans it could be the only option.
The Independent Schools Information Service offers a loan plan in
conjunction with NatWest Bank, which lets you borrow new amounts for each
term's fees, while interest of 2.5 percentage points above base rate accrues
on the outstanding funds. You have to buy an endowment to ensure that the
loan is ultimately repaid. This means that you part with more than the total
amount of money the school receives, whereas with pre-planning, you pay
less, in nominal terms at least, than is eventually paid to the school.
Advisers - including John Bridel of Towry Law  - suggest that you could get
a cheaper loan by remortgaging your house. As a rule, home-secured loans
offer the cheapest credit.
But the current repossessions crisis in the housing market should remind
everyone of the health warning which must be pinned on such a scheme. Shop
around before committing yourself to debt, and make sure the terms are an
improvement on the Isis scheme.

FT  07 MAR 92 / The FT Schools 500 (3): The search for an education for life
 -How to assess a school's 'added value'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW DO you measure a school's added value? Is it possible to do it in any
systematic way? With league tables now a way of life, those questions are
likely to dominate educational discourse for years.
The key issue is the extent to which raw test and examination results
reflect a 'true' measure of pupil achievement. Numerous ideas are on the
table for improving them. The Audit Commission favours comparisons between A
level and GCSE results; a recent paper published by the National Commission
on Education suggests 'correcting' raw scores by allowing for quantifiable
measures of social deprivation and academic potential; some independent
schools are already doing their own value added tests, comparing GCSE and A
level results with common entrance and/or IQ scores.
This survey gives insufficient information for tests of that type. But it is
not just exam-score value that schools add: all but the most austere
cramming institution claims a broader educative role for itself than that.
That said, what else do schools claim to add?
Our survey asked two questions to elicit views. We asked head teachers,
first, which activities they thought distinguished their schools from others
in the independent sector; and second, on which three aspects of secondary
education they placed most emphasis. One head snorted that he was 'not going
in for such airy and cliched platitudes', but most responded - and the
collective picture is striking.
The consensus on the 'three aspects' is summed up in one three-line
response: 'maximising academic potential; extra-curricular activities;
caring and civilised community.' Low staff:pupil ratios appeared frequently;
so did the number of scholarships. Virtually none mentioned the need for a
broad social mix.
Some elaborated on the 'civilised community'. For Yarm School, Cleveland,
'Discipline Without Regimentation' was the key; the head of Bury Grammar
School for Girls wants to create a supportive environment 'where education
is fun'; while Marlborough stressed the need to cultivate a sense of 'duty
to plough back into society the benefits of a privileged education.'
Cultivation of a Christian ethos is emphasised by a fair proportion of
schools. Normally it is in the context of pastoral care and 'values'. But
many Catholic schools lay it on more heavily (Downside School, Bath, prides
itself on its standing 'as part of a worldwide Benedictine family'), and for
Ackworth School, West Yorks, one of the few Quaker institutions,
'recognising the value of silence in widely differing situations' is a
priority.
As to extra-curricular activities, answers to the first question were most
revealing. Music, drama and 'the great outdoors' featured generally, with
several schools boasting recently-opened theatres. Combined Cadet Forces
still regiment a large proportion of boys, and the Duke of Edinburgh's award
is followed far and wide.
But sport generally heads the list - in all types of schools. It is not so
much the prominence of sport that is stressed, but the the range of sports
on offer (Millfield claims the most - 30), and the modernity of the
facilities for their pursuit.
Surprisingly few schools claim overseas links - as opposed to trips - as
particular points in their favour. But the concept of Shrewsbury's 'European
Liaison Officer' will doubtless spread widely, as will variants on Latymer
Upper School's annual exchange with a Hamburg school. Involvement in the
European Youth Parliament figures frequently.
For many schools, comparative advantage is sought in the unusual - or even
positively idiosyncratic. Caterham School boasts a Kenyan Wilderness
Expedition; Clifton a 'resident scientist'; Bradfield a classical Greek play
 -performed in Greek  - once every three years; Charterhouse a four-day
poetry festival and international poetry competition. However, Badminton
School, Bristol, must take the biscuit, with: 'constructing a real
aeroplane.'
Links with local business hardly feature at all, though some mention young
enterprise schemes and a few highlight work-shadowing projects. Highgate
School, London, takes the pressures of modern life most seriously: it lays
on an 'urban survival course' for all fourth and fifth formers.
How do the heads themselves think parents should go about weighing up the
merits of rival schools?
Go and look, talk to everyone, and do not be over-impressed by the marketing
hype, is the general response. But Philip Johnston, headmaster of Queen
Elizabeth's Grammar School, Blackburn, offers a basic yardstick: 'Check the
boys' toilets, the way the staff dress, the cleanliness of the school, and
the head master's availability to meet 'normal' parents.' Who, one wonders,
are the 'abnormal' parents?
STRENGTHS: THE SCHOOLS' VIEW
'Sixth form council of pupils and staff decide punishments for serious
discipline offences: 'Bionics', a sports club for the disabled, held
every fortnight.' (Malvern Girls)
'Sixth form 'flat experience' on a budget. They must cater for themselves
for a week. This is a trial run for student life.' (Lawnside)
'We select our prefects by job description, application and interview, and
all have a chance to apply.' (Laurel Bank)
'Wide range of mother tongue and foreign language offerings.' (International
School)

FT  07 MAR 92 / The FT Schools 500 (2): Read the questions first]
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MANY EXAM candidates find it a tiresome instruction, but most pupils accept
that it is wise to 'read the examination paper carefully before attempting
to answer the questions'. If only all of the 500 head teachers who
participated in our survey had done the same when filling in our
questionnaires . . .
Some returns made very strange reading. Twenty schools claimed to be
commanding fees in excess of Pounds 15,000 - twice that charged by Eton. And
several we thought had excellent academic records barely scraped into the
top 200 on the data they supplied.
We telephoned those schools with major anomalies and corrected their
entries.
One headmaster dismissed school league tables based on A and B grades as
'crap' at a meeting of the Headmasters' Conference (later dispelling alarm
at his schoolboy language by explaining that this stood for Cumulative Ratio
of Academic Performance). There was even talk of boycotting newspaper
surveys.
Another head talked of foul play. Some schools, he claimed, had excluded
failed A levels when working out the percentage of top grades.
Although we have no evidence to support these claims we were disturbed by
the many discrepancies between our own figures for the percentage of A and B
passes, which we calculated from raw data, and those published elsewhere.
Differences of 2 or 3 per cent were common. Some were as high as 7 per cent,
and this made a considerable difference to a school's final rank position.
And 20 schools in our top 100 have been omitted from other league tables of
similar size.
Another area of concern expressed frequently by educationalists is that
league tables ignore the question of 'value added' (see article on Page 4).
Independent schools cater for children with a very wide range of abilities.
League tables of examination performance suggest that a selective school
with outstanding A level results is better than one achieving average
results with less-than-averagely academic pupils.
A level results do, nevertheless, provide an objective measure of a school's
academic performance. While schools continue to provide details of their A
levels results in a form that is neither easy to interpret, nor to compare
with other schools, league tables such as the FT 500 are an invaluable
information source for parents.
This supplement is the culmination of six months' intensive research. The
first two months were spent testing the water. What did parents want to
know? How much information were schools able and willing to give? How could
we ensure the information we received would be representative and
comparable? And how could we ensure a good response rate?
We started by circulating a draft questionnaire to 50 experts, including all
members of the Independent Schools Joint Council, head teachers' and
teachers' associations, examining bodies, educationalists, the Department of
Education and Science, plus individual head masters and head mistresses,
teachers and parents.
Head teachers of schools that had performed well in league tables in the
past were quick to reply. Others were pleased to be included for the first
time.
Peter Owen, headmaster of Rushmoor and chairman of the Independent Schools
Association, best summed up the problems of school league tables: 'Two C
grades and a D grade from one pupil may be a far greater achievement for the
individual and the school than a very bright pupil getting three A grades.
And a pupil with good grades from one school may have received a very narrow
education compared with another pupil with the same grades from a different
school.
'In the end, a good school academically is not the one with the best
results. It is the one that gets the most out of their pupils in all ways,
whatever the ability of those pupils may be.'

FT  07 MAR 92 / The FT Schools 500 (1):  Public schools that made the grades
 -How this special FT survey assessed the sixth form performance of almost
500 fee-paying schools in Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN DE BONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'ARE WE not setting the agenda for parental choice on far too narrow a
front?' Joan Townsend, of Oxford High, is not the only head teacher to
express reservations about school league tables. Yet the Headmasters'
Conference compiles its own table of examination results - although this is
not made available to parents of prospective pupils.
Tony Evans, head of Portsmouth Grammar (rated sixth in this FT 500 schools
survey) revealed the ambivalence of head teachers in his autumn term report
to parents: 'The A level results were very satisfactory, the overall pass
rate being 93 per cent, 59 per cent achieved at grades A and B. This placed
the school eighteenth in the Headmasters' Conference. However, I would wish
to repeat my comments at prizegiving that education is broader and more
humane in its purpose than the acquisition of the top two A level grades
alone.'
Independent schools clearly recognise the competitive value of a good
academic record, and most include detailed examination results in their
prospectuses. The problem for parents is that the information is often
presented in an inconsistent form, making meaningful comparisons difficult.
Our tables on Pages 7 to 11 address this problem by giving comparative data
on nearly 500 independent secondary schools in England, Wales and Scotland.
It is the biggest and most comprehensive survey of its kind, and although
not every school in the UK is included, we have taken pains to include all
which replied and which teach A Levels (or Highers in Scotland).
Previous surveys have ranked schools only on the performance of their best
pupils - schools were compared on the percentage of A and B grades attained
at A Level.
Our survey is the first to assess the results of all A level candidates in
the second year sixth form using the points system used by the Universities
Central Council on Admissions (UCCA). This quantifies performance of all
grades on the following scale: grade E, two points; grade D, four points;
grade C, six points; grade B, eight points; and grade A, ten points. We have
added all the points obtained to produce a combined UCCA points score for
each school.
Dividing a school's total UCCA points by the number of subjects entered
gives a measure of the success rate. For example if every pupil achieved an
A grade in every subject, the average UCCA score per entry would be 10. If
the average grade were a B, the score would be 8 and so on.
It would not, however, be fair to use this score per entry as the basis for
ranking all schools. This is because schools entering only their best pupils
for a narrow range of subjects would have an unfair advantage over schools
with a broader entry policy. On this measure, the Yehudi Menuhin School came
out second, beating Eton and Winchester. Previous attempts by newspapers to
rank schools according to their A and B grades are open to the same
objection.
An alternative measure of success is the average UCCA points score per
pupil. This, after all, is what most universities look at when assessing
candidates for entry. However this measure unfairly discriminates against
schools which limit the number of A level subjects to three and use the
extra time for optional subjects, which are not examined. Schools which
routinely enter pupils for four A levels could achieve a maximum of 40
points per pupil compared with only 30 for those entering an average three
subjects.
We have combined scores for performance per pupil and performance per entry
in an index which gives equal weight to both. This index therefore provides
some measure of academic excellence and of breadth.
Our tables also list separately the performance per entry, performance per
pupil and the average number of A
Turn to Page 2
Schools 500 From Page 1
level entries per pupil in each school. Although we have given a separate
ranking for each school (with some ties), many of the scores are close
together, so schools within a range of about 20 places may be broadly
comparable in academic standard.
Obviously, the ranking measures no more than standards at A level. Some
schools may have wider academic merits which the table does not capture. We
have, however, rejected the idea of broad groupings or league tables,
because these make arbitrary discriminations between schools at the bottom
of one league and those at the top of the next.
In spite of claims that General Studies is an easy exam which boosts the
results of schools that include it in their A level syllabuses, our detailed
findings show otherwise. We compared individual schools' average UCCA points
per entry both including and excluding General Studies. While some scores
went up when General Studies was included, others went down and many stayed
the same.
However, a good education cannot be measured by statistics alone, as Gillian
Ellis, headmistress of Streatham Hill and Clapham High (101 in our table)
emphasised:
'I accept that league tables are here to stay and in theory I welcome the
'debunking' which you are setting out to do. However, you are still
concentrating on facts and figures and nowhere can I see the questions which
would elicit the 'value added' factor.'
However, not the least of the virtues of the FT 500 is that it enables
parents to make their own judgments of value added. (For further details,
see the piece by Andrew Adonis on Page 4)
Many of the top schools in our survey admit only bright pupils, and many
schools with less impressive examination results do excellent work with less
gifted children. Their achievements should not be overlooked.
Chris Symington, financial director of Bury Lawn School, (rank 400) was not
alone in expressing concern about comparisons. 'We take the first children
to register, regardless of their ability. Our sixth form is also
non-selective and last year a large number remained, whereas anywhere else
they would not have even considered staying past the age of 16.'
Sibford, Banbury, is an example of another type of school that should not be
judged solely by its A level achievements. All students work for the City
and Guilds Diploma in Vocational Education, and while some also take A
levels its headteacher, John Dunston, sees the school as providing an
alternative path for those students for whom a three-A level course in not
appropriate. The A level results of specialist schools teaching, for
example, music and dance should also be treated with caution.
'We provide an unusually supportive atmosphere for children of all abilities
and strive to build in each of them a self esteem which may not be possible
in a more pressured, traditional academic environment.'
Whatever the value of academic scoring, schools should not be judged on just
one year's results. Gary Best, headmaster of Kingswood School, Bath (342),
supplied the previous two year's examinations results to illustrate the
point:
'Every year for the past decade, the number of A and B grades has been at
least 40 per cent of the grades attained. This year they were less than 20
per cent because of the pupils' poorer academic standard in comparison with
our norm.'
HOW SCHOOLS COMPARED
Our three top ranked schools - King Edward's (Birmingham), King Edward VI
High (Birmingham) and Portsmouth High - are all day schools. Looking further
down the list, day schools continue to lead the field: they account for 70
per cent of the schools in our survey; eight are in our Top Ten table, 15 in
the top 20, and 78 in the top 100. Winchester (4), Eton (7) and Wycombe
Abbey (13) were the top three boarding schools.
Single sex schools outranked co-educational schools. Boys' schools were on
top, holding seven of the first ten places, including the lead position
(King Edward's). Half the boys' schools in our survey admit girls to the
sixth form, but interestingly these were less well represented in the top
100 than those with boys-only sixth forms.
Girls' day schools came second, third and sixth in our top ten (King Edward
VI High, Portsmouth High and The Queen's School, Chester). The third, fourth
and fifth ranked boarding schools were for girls - Wycombe Abbey (13
overall), St Mary's, Calne, (17) and St Swithun's, Winchester (20), as were
11 of the 22 boarding schools in the top 100.
Nearly a quarter of the schools in our table were co-ed. None appeared in
the top 20 and only eight in the top 100. The King's School, Canterbury (55)
had the distinction of being the only co-educational boarding school of the
37 in our survey to get into the top 100.
Schools belonging to the Girls' Public Day School Trust deserve mention. Ten
of the 20 GPDST schools in our table are placed in the top 100 and two were
in the top ten - Portsmouth High (3) and South Hampstead High (15). GPDST
schools are among the least expensive day schools in our survey.
Girls at Portsmouth High had the additional distinction of achieving the
best A level grades: on average they gained nine UCCA points per examination
entry - midway between an A and B grade. Fifteen other schools scored more
than eight UCCA points per A level. The majority of schools in our survey
had commendable A level results - all but 14 schools in the top 200, for
example, scored an average of six or more UCCA points (between a B and C
grade).
Pass rates for the majority of schools were also impressive. A quarter had a
pass rate of between three and four A levels per pupil; a further half of
between 2.5 and three. Pupils at the Hellenic College, London (68) and Derby
High (112) averaged a remarkable 4.2 A levels each.
We have tried to compare schools on the proportion of pupils going on to
higher education. As any parent will find, reliable data is hard to come by.
Pamela Parsonson, headteacher of Francis Holland, London (255), for example,
quoted a figure of 54 per cent, adding that an unusually high proportion of
pupils were taking a 'year out' and that 80 per cent was a more
representative figure. However, many other schools simply supplied a figure
for the previous or a typical year.
Eight schools with good academic records chose not to complete our
questionnaire: Bedford High, Bristol Grammar, Cheltenham College (148),
Harrow (82), Hulme Grammar, Oldham (113), Norwich High (93), Notting Hill
and Ealing High (95) and Stockport Grammar (32). A few schools are unranked
in our table due to insufficient information.
We asked members of the public to write to them on our behalf asking for
their prospectuses and exam results. We have based their entries (listed in
the tables in italics) on these and other published information.
It is virtually impossible to draw performance comparisons between English
and Scottish schools. Instead of A levels, most pupils in Scotland sit five
Scottish Highers (though some take A levels as well). Some also sit the
Certificate of Sixth Year Studies (CSYS) in up to three subjects.
Furthermore, UCCA does not have a points system for Scottish examinations
(though Highers are recognised for entrance to English
Turn to Page 3
From Page 2
universities). Scottish schools are therefore listed in a separate table.
Variations in the examination courses offered by the different schools
prevented us from rating Scottish schools. However, where a significant
number of pupils have sat exams, we have given average points per Higher (A
= 8; B = 6; C = 4; D = 2) and average points per CSYS (A = 10; B = 8; C = 6;
D = 4; E = 2). We have also given average UCCA points per A level entry.
The three points systems are not comparable - a grade A at A level is not
equivalent to a grade B CSYS - and comparisons should not be made across the
three columns.
How deep parents have to dig into their pockets for their children's private
education appears to have more to do with the lavishness of a school's
facilities and endowments than its examination results.
Although Winchester charges almost twice the average fee for day pupils,
most of the fees of our top 20 schools are fairly typical and some, such as
Haberdashers' Aske's, Elstree (19) and Portsmouth High (3), are well below
average.
Fees vary widely around the country. The average fee at day schools in
Berkshire and Wiltshire is over Pounds 6,000 a year - double that in
Humberside, Tyne and Wear and South Yorkshire.
Half the schools in our survey charge the same fees for weekly boarders as
they do for full boarders.
The fees quoted in our table are those set at September 1991. Schools vary
as to what they include in their basic fees. Some schools anticipated rises
during the year. Most predicted a rise of around 10 per cent next year. Some
have a range of fees for different age groups (we have quoted the lower
end).
Increasing the amount of comparative information available to parents is
essential if they are to make an informed choice of school. Our survey
should go a long way to help parents narrow the choice.
Perhaps the last word, like the first, should come from Joan Townsend of
Oxford High: 'I am glad to see a newspaper collating more information than a
few brute grades, but depressed by the thought of the deluge to come from
elsewhere.'

FT  06 MAR 92 / Echoes of Just Cause as Noriega's star rises: The 1989
invasion of Panama may become an issue in this year's US presidential
election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HENRY HAMMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS the drug trafficking conspiracy trial of General Manuel Antonio Noriega,
the former Panamanian leader, creaks to a conclusion - yesterday marked its
69th day - speculation is growing that he might be acquitted on at least
some of the main counts.
Simultaneously, the possibility grows that the 1989 US invasion of Panama
might become an issue in this year's US presidential campaign.
President George Bush's Desert Storm victory last year no longer resonates
with voters. A rejection by the jurors in the Miami trial of all or most of
the charges against Gen Noriega would mean that the rationale of an earlier
foreign policy action - Operation Just Cause, which sought the general's
capture - would be open to question.
Although it is open to debate how the jury will react to what they have
heard, the general's prosecutors do not appear to have had a good week. For
this, they can blame a dead man, a self-styled political refugee and a fiery
Panamanian woman legislator.
The dead man - Mr William Casey, the Reagan-era director of Central
Intelligence - cropped up when a former CIA Panama station chief testified
that Mr Casey had met Gen Noriega in Panama days after Gen Noriega held a
Havana tete-a-tete with President Fidel Castro in 1984.
Gen Noriega told Mr Casey what Mr Castro had to say about Central America
and exchanged gifts with the intelligence chief - Mr Casey's book for the
general, some of the general's private stock of Cuban cigars for Mr Casey.
This evidence appears to have bolstered the defence claim that Gen Noriega
was an important US ally.
The self-styled political refugee - Mr Rodolfo Castrellon, Panama Air Force
officer and former ambassador to Israel during the Noriega regime  - denied
a key element in the government's case that the general was involved in a
conspiracy with the Medelln drugs cartel.
Mr Castrellon contradicted a claim by a government witness that a group of
Colombian cocaine chemists captured by the Panamanians had been returned to
Colombia on a champagne flight via executive jet - demonstrating Gen
Noriega's cosy relationship with Colombian drug interests.
Mr Castrellon, who has sought political asylum in the US claiming fear of
persecution in Panama, was the air force officer who arranged the return
flight. He identified photographs which showed that the aircraft used was an
old cargo aircraft and the passengers wore chains.
The Panamanian legislator - Mrs Balbina Herrera  - had been identified by
one of the government's earliest witnesses - former drug dealer Mr Max
Marmelstein - as a 1983 contact with whom he arranged landing rights for
drug-carrying aircraft in Panama.
But Mrs Herrera furiously branded that testimony a lie and said that in 1983
she was working as a junior-grade economist in an institute of the
Department of Education which provided scholarships to Panamanian secondary
and university students.
None of this testimony would, of itself, damage a strong prosecution case.
The government's problem is that there are doubts about how well the overall
case against the general is holding up.
Panamanian journalists covering the trial report widespread belief in
Panama, where the trial receives more attention than in the US, that Gen
Noriega may be acquitted.
Last week, Panamanian vice-president Guillermo Ford told a Miami audience
that the his government had decided that, were the general to be freed,
Panama would seek his extradition. Mr Ford acknowledged, however, that no
criminal charges had been laid against Gen Noriega in Panama.
The jurors will be instructed by the judge that they should vote to convict
only if they find the general's guilt proved beyond reasonable doubt.
But some attorneys who have been following the case think the jurors will
decide their verdict based more on their attitude toward the government as
an institution than on the complex evidence they have heard in the months
since the start of the trial last September.
If that view is correct, another week like this one could mean problems for
the government side.

FT  06 MAR 92 / The little town in Sicily which refuses to bow before the
Mafia / A report on a community's common front against extortion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE carnival in Capo d'Orlando, a prosperous resort below the mountains of
the rugged north-eastern coast of Sicily, has been a special occasion this
year. The townspeople have been celebrating a great victory over the local
Mafia. Capo d'Orlando is the first community in Sicily to organise a common
front against Mafia extortion and denounce those seeking protection money.
And after a historic trial last November, 15 mafiosi are behind bars.
'We refused to be intimidated,' says Mr Francesco Chirieleison, who runs a
large jewellery shop off the main square. He was one of 27 businessmen who
united to denounce the Mafia in December 1990. 'If you pay up, you are
finished; and we have shown what happens when you are unafraid to break
omerta (the traditional Sicilian law of silence). The state has responded
because there was no omerta.'
Although Italy is caught up in a campaign for general elections on April 5,
in Capo d'Orlando the fight against the Mafia dominates all issues. 'The
fight is far from over,' says Mr Nino Messina, the long-serving Christian
Democrat mayor.
Two carabinieri in bullet-proof jackets control cars entering the town. Mr
Tano Grassi, a leading member of the Capo d'Orlando anti-Mafia association,
is standing as a candidate for the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS),
formed from the former Communist Party which has always campaigned bravely
against the Mafia. He has a fulltime police protection.
Along the coast at Santa Agata di Militello, 20kms away, two shops were
fire-bombed last week in separate incidents in an attempt to intimidate
traders who have taken heart from Capo d'Orlando and formed an anti-Mafia
front leading to the arrest of four racketeers. At Tortorici, a small town
in the mountains behind Capo d'Orlando where traders have taken a similar
stance, the Mafia reacted by burning down a new police station.
Mr Chirieleison says the anti-Mafia association does not recognise political
parties. 'If you get the political parties involved, they will want your
vote and it will only be manipulated,' he says. 'The politicians have helped
create the Mafia because they've allowed the state to be weak; and the Mafia
thrives where the state is absent.'
The politicians, however, have rushed to recognise Capo d'Orlando. The town
has received more politicians and officials in the past three months than in
the entire post-war period. In the wake of the assassination last September
of Mr Libero Grassi, a Palermo businessman who publicly refused to pay Mafia
protection money, this community has been lionised as a symbol of resistance
to the ever-growing power of organised crime.
But the police in particular recognise that stopping extortion in Capo
d'Orlando is a modest step. Throughout the island the law of silence
prevails.
There are no witnesses to Mafia killings. In the big cities like Catania and
Palermo nine out of ten businesses pay protection money while the 180-odd
Mafia clans are reckoned to control at least 60 per cent of all public
contracts.
'We need more jobs, especially in the interior, to create a new culture of
honest work,' says Mr Messina. The mafiosi who began trying to impose their
law on Capo d'Orlando three years ago come from the impoverished isolated
mountain communities.
'The elections won't change things much. Besides we've had so many of them
and I can't see the vote pattern altering much,' adds Mr Messina.
Eastern Sicily consistently records one of the highest Christian Democrat
votes throughout Italy, and Sicily is solidly behind the party. In the last
general elections of 1987, Capo d'Orlando recorded a 44 per cent vote for
the Christian Democrats, 10 percentage points above the national average.
'The Christian Democrats get the vote because the voters see them as the
party of power and hope they might call in some favour, and traditionally
the Church has been behind them - even if this is the party which has been
most compliant towards the Mafia,' says a PDS activist.
The PDS has no illusions about faring badly in Sicily. It reckons it has
lost votes as a result of the collapse of the Communist party; but also its
support has been eroded by the appearance of a protest party, La Rete,
headed by Mr Leoluca Orlando, the former Christian Democrat mayor of
Palermo.
To the caustic comments of many a Sicilian, Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader of
the north Italian populist movement, the Lombard League, has decided to flex
his political muscle by declaring himself a candidate for Catania on an
anti-Mafia ticket. Significantly the anti-Mafia platform has been implicitly
taken on board by the Christian Democrats in their poster campaign in Sicily
with the slogan 'The right to exist'.
But the propaganda campaign is limited to the big cities in seeming
recognition that Sicilian voters are either indifferent or committed and the
money is best spent elsewhere in Italy.

FT  06 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls firm on dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELIEF greeted news of a maintained dividend by Rolls-Royce, as the company
reported a 71 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 51m, the bottom end of
expectations. The dividend was maintained at 4.7p, making a year's total of
7.25p.
Release of the figures saw the shares race forward and at the day's best
they were 12 up, as analysts pointed to a better cash position than had been
feared. The slow recovery in the spares business attracted attention at an
analysts' meeting with the board, however, and after this the shares
relinquished earlier gains to close only 6 up at 146p. Turnover was heavy at
16m shares.
Mr Clive Forrestier-Walker at Charterhouse Tilney said: 'This is a good
result in a difficult year with a sustained recovery in prospect over the
next few years.' The range for current year forecasts is between Pounds 100m
to Pounds 150m.
Raine surprises
Raine Industries, the housebuilding group, delivered two surprises to the
market by its acquisition of Walter Lawrence, the Hertfordshire-based
builder, and its proposed Pounds 33.5m rights issue to help fund the deal.
Raine launched its agreed offer for Lawrence via a one-for-two share swap.
Raine shares fell heavily after the news, closing 14 off at 110p on turnover
of 567,000, but those of Lawrence more than doubled at one point to 50p
prior to ending a busy session at 46p, up 23.
Yesterday's developments accompanied Raine's interim results which showed
profits struck after a Pounds 3.4m write-down of its near-3 per cent stake
in YJ Lovell, the construction group.
Raine built the stake last summer before Lovell announced a rights issue and
before its share price plummeted in response to heavy losses, dividend
omission and disclosure that it had breached its banking covenants.
Power downgrades
Barclays de Zoete Wedd (BZW), the investment bank, appeared to have been
largely responsible for hefty turnover and share price falls in National
Power and PowerGen. The latter dropped 7 to 236p on 5.5m shares traded while
the former was also 7 down at 223p on 2.6m shares.
Mr Chris Rowland, electricity industry analyst at BZW, in a detailed and
bearish review of the two generators, evaluated their prospects after 1993,
when they will lose protection of the existing contracts with the regional
electricity companies.
'We believe the inevitable consequences of a period of lower margins for the
two companies in the mid-1990's will be much reduced levels of profitability
with dividend security threatened,' said Mr Rowland.
He considers both shares overvalued by one third relative to the market. He
predicts that National Power profits will drop from an expected Pounds 560m
for 1993 to Pounds 250m for 1994 and those of PowerGen from Pounds 370m in
1993 to Pounds 170m in 1994.
Ladbroke steady
Reporting trading figures from its interests ranging from hotels to
betting-shops, Ladbroke turned in satisfactory results, the shares adding 5
to 229p in very heavy volume of 7.3m. Analysts declared themselves pleased
with the disclosures from the normally somewhat reticent group, including
the details on the property and hotel businesses. A dividend increase above
expectations also helped sentiment.
Improving hotel occupancy figures, particularly abroad, an improved outlook
for the betting industry, and satisfaction that the group had gone some way
towards addressing its property write-downs inspired most houses to upgrade
profit forecasts for 1992. County NatWest is looking for a gross Pounds
245m, Hoare Govett Pounds 250m, Smith New Court Pounds 275m, with no
capitalisation on property, and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is on Pounds 230m, net
of any hotel disposals.
Prudential, removed from County NatWest's list of 30 best buys, fell 4 to
239p. Composites were given a mauling, as marketmakers chopped their prices
to head off any attempted selling. Low levels of turnover in the stocks,
proved they had been successful. Royal Insurance was the weakest performer,
sliding a further 10 to 176p.
Insurance broker Lloyd Thompson, due to report interim figures soon, drew
strong support and closed 10 higher at 240p.
Singer &amp; Friedlander were nudged up 3 to 44p after James Capel, the
stockbroker moved into the market to buy up to 33.55m shares at 40p a share
for cancellation. Volume in Singer shot up to 63m, indicating that most of
the stock had been bought in. A large line of Singer stock, some 7.7m
shares, changed hands late on Wednesday. Specialists said the rise in
Singer's share price reflected the increase in assets per share after the
stock buy in.
The recent resilient performance of BP shares was reversed yesterday as US
institutions reacted to claims of an uninspiring presentation in New York on
Wednesday evening, by Mr John Browne, BP's head of exploration and
production activities. News that BP Canada had passed its interim dividend
was an added depressant.
The BP Canada news was described by one oil specialist as 'immaterial in
cash terms to BP but nevertheless a story that has ruffled feathers on Wall
Street'.
With the US buying spree at least temporarily at an end, BP shares retreated
to 262p before steadying and ending the session a net 4 1/2 lower at 265p.
Turnover of 9.3m shares, although ahead of average activity levels, was well
down on recent sessions.
The smaller oil stocks suffered from the effects of a programme trade made
up entirely of second line exploration issues. These included Clyde, 2 off
at 56p, Goal, 3 1/2 down at 55p, Premier, a penny easier at 23p and Monument
Oil &amp; Gas,  3/4 off at 31 1/4 p.
More speculation over the possibility of Thorn EMI wining the battle for
Virgin's music division again undermined the shares which fell 12 to 785p.
Good volume in Granada Group pushed the shares 7 higher at 255p as the
market reflected on Wednesday's AGM and upcoming institutional presentation
on BSkyB. Turnover reached 4.9m.
A rally by Unilever was against the market trend, rising 8 to 942p in
reaction to speculation that the company will sell off its animal feeds
business.
Results from United Biscuits are due next Thursday. The shares fell 7 to
412p despite a forecast from County NatWest that 1991 profits will rise 4
per cent to Pounds 206m.
The recent decline by Bass continued, with the shares losing another 13 to
548p, declining from 579p at the end of last week. Analyst Mr Christopher
Wickham, at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said it was hardly surprising that
Bass has been hit by profit-taking after a good run. He fears that the
company's major divisions, with the possible exception of soft drinks, are
probably performing worse than last year.
Recent bid rumours supported Boddington, with the shares rising 4 to 188p
ahead of the results on March 25.
BAA retreated 15 to 563p after James Capel weighed in with a profits
down-grading. The broker reduced its profits forecast by Pounds 20m to
Pounds 185m for the year to March 1992. Miss Yasmin Harrison, at James
Capel, believes 'there will be further write-downs in BAA's Central London
properties and slower-than-expected traffic recovery'.
Simon Engineering powered ahead, jumping 19 to 271p after County NatWest
included the stock on its list of 30 best buys.
The leaked opinion poll pointing to a substantial Labour lead over the
Conservatives in key marginal constituencies, triggered a minor shakeout in
the utilities areas of the market. But dealers emphasised there were no
signs of the big institutions hitting the panic button to sell the sectors
ahead of the election; 'there was no shortage of sellers but much of it was
straightforward profit-taking,' said one dealer. Turnover figures confirmed
this, with Anglian Water slipping 11 to 358p on meagre activity of 813,000
shares.

FT  06 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falls sharply in the wake
of bond yields rise
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US SHARE prices fell sharply yesterday in the wake of another rise in bond
yields and rumours that a major property developer was in trouble, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 27.06 at 3,241.50,
having spent the day in negative territory. The more broadly based Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 2.81 at 406.52, while the Nasdaq
composite of over-the-counter stocks dropped 8.32 to 621.97. Turnover on the
NYSE was 208m. The day's economic news - a 21,000 fall in weekly jobless
claims - provided little comfort, and once again the bond market, and
another rise in bond yields, set the tone for equity sentiment. The day's
trading was also cautious with investors wary, ahead of today's employment
figures for February which could decide whether the Federal Reserve cuts
interest rates again to get the economy moving.
Bank stocks were harmed by rumours of financial distress at Olympia &amp; York,
the big Candian property developer, which denied the rumours. Chase
Manhattan fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 22 1/2 , Chemical lost Dollars 1 1/8
at Dollars 31 1/2 and J P Morgan slipped Dollars 1 to Dollars Dollars 59.
Retailers were in the spotlight following the release of February sales
figures that showed increases across the board, although the data were
distorted by the extra leap-year day. Wal-Mart jumped Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 53 1/4 after reporting a 20 per cent gain in sales, JC Penney rose
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 62 7/8 (sales up 10.5 per cent) and Woolworth fell
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 29 1/8 (sales rose 3.1 per cent).
After a delayed opening due to an imbalance of sell orders, Gap fell Dollars
2 5/8 to Dollars 45 3/4 in turnover of 3m shares after the clothing retailer
reported fourth quarter profits of 59 cents-a-share, and full-year profits
of Dollars 1.62-a-share. Although the results were no worse than expected,
the latest sales figures for February were below some analysts' forecasts.
Baltimore Bancorp plunged Dollars 1 to Dollars 6 3/8 it restated its 1991
fourth quarter loss to Dollars 7.42-a-share because of an increase in loan
loss provisions.
Canada
TORONTO real estate and financial shares led a broad market decline as
rumours spread of financial difficulties facing real estate giant Olympia &amp;
York Developments.
Based on preliminary data, the composite index tumbled 42.09 points, or 1.17
per cent, to 3,545.55, with declining issues trampling advances 405 to 207.
Volume was 27.4m shares worth CDollars 337.7m against the previous day's
25.5m shares valued at CDollars 279.3m.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Congress may rule on sale of
defence metals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSH Administration may be ordered by Congress to sell off as much as
Dollars 1bn (Pounds .50bn) in fiscal 1993 in surplus metals and materials
stored in the US National Defence Stockpile.
The Pentagon said last week that, with the end of the Cold War, it could
drastically pare the stockpile, now worth about Dollars 9bn. Its
never-attained 'goals' would be cut from Dollars 19.1bn in supplies to
Dollars 3.3bn.
Congressman Charles Bennett, the 81-year-old chairman of the defence
subcommittee overseeing the stockpile, said that the Pentagon has never even
sold off the Dollars 1bn in 'excess and outdated' materials that it was
authorised to sell during each of the last five years. A departmental
inspector general's report found that stockpile managers sold only Dollars
231m in excess materials from fiscal years 1988-91.
'Bureaucratic incompetence,' Mr Bennett grumbled. Now he will introduce
legislation to force the Pentagon to sell Dollars 1bn in materials in the
next fiscal year.
For years the Reagan and Bush Administration either ignored the stockpile or
tried to sell off its more marketable metals in order to raise money for the
budget. Silver auctions, conducted in the 1980's, produced an explosive
reaction from the mining industry and they were discontinued.
Silver is now being sold off slowly in the form of commemorative coins.
Proceeds are supposed to go into a stockpile transaction fund for the
purchase of new materials.
Mr Bennett agrees with the Pentagon that what is now needed is 'a lean
stockpile attuned to the needs of modern military technology and combat.'
However, he has not yet decided if he will agree to a Pentagon request for a
moratorium on acquisitions while the department makes further studies.
The Pentagon has already decided that goals should be based on the
supposition of a three month war with a one-year mobilisation period, rather
than a three year conventional global war.
Unless Congress agrees to the ban on purchases, the Pentagon has said that
this year it will buy jewel bearings, columbium group metals, indium, rubber
and tantalum metal, at a total cost of Dollars 31.7m.
In fiscal 1992, it has asked for new legislative authority to sell: 3m
pounds of cobalt worth Dollars 45m; bauxite worth Dollars 17.2m; 5,000 short
tonnes of nickel worth Dollars 31.3m; and 50,000 short tonnes of zinc worth
50,000. It will continue to sell off its tin (12,000 tonnes) and silver
(9.4m troy ounces in the form of commemorative coins) slowly, to avoid
disrupting the markets.
In this fiscal year, it wants also to sell asbestos, bismuth, fluorspar,
graphite, industrial diamonds, iodine, manganese, mercury, mica, quartz
crystal, silicon carbide, thorium nitrate, and talc.
Ultimately, the Pentagon plans to sell off all its aluminium, copper, lead,
mercury, nickel, rayon, silver, and zinc. It hopes to dispose of much of its
bauxite, cobalt, chromite, and platinum group metals.
The Pentagon says it plans research and development in new materials,
initially involving light metals and alloys.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese copper imports signal
rising demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METALS MARKET analysts are keeping a careful watch on statistics emerging
from China because some believe that the country might well this year return
as a big buyer.
Already persistent rumours suggest the Chinese are looking for between
50,000 and 100,000 tonnes of copper in 1992. That would have a substantial
impact on the predicted supply surplus - forecast to be between 100,000 and
200,000 tonnes.
China's total copper imports were only 40,251 tonnes last year, but Codelco,
Chile's state-owned producer, said it sold 15,000 tonnes to China last month
and expects to do the same in January.
Traders suggest that imports are not, however, confined to refined metal.
The Chinese have also bought copper scrap, blister and concentrates.
Mr Euan Worthington, analyst at the S G Warburg financial services group,
says copper has been in short supply in China for many years as none of its
mines are very substantial. In 1990 mine output is estimated to have reached
only 360,000 tonnes. Refined copper production was 490,000 tonnes.
Geologists have recently found six large copper deposits but some observers
believe that the country will not be self-sufficient in copper until the end
of the decade and could become an increasingly important importer, says Mr
Worthington in Warburg's latest International Mining Outlook report.
Other metals are also likely to feel the impact of China's recent dramatic
economic growth. According to the World Bureau of Metal Statistics, at the
recent peak, in 1985, China's net imports of aluminium totalled 482,500
tonnes; those of copper were 356,000 tonnes; and those of zinc were 269,000
tonnes.
Lead net imports were at their highest in 1984 at 6,400 tonnes. As for tin,
China's export performance makes a substantial difference to the market's
health. In 1985, for example, it exported 7,300 tonnes of tin. In 1989 this
doubled to 15,900 tonnes.
'The potential for base metal demand from China to increase is huge - a
position that will be tempered only by the availability of foreign exchange
and the existing infrastructure,' says Mr Worthington.
Mr Worthington points out that, along with copper, aluminium has been
identified as a metal of major importance and, although China's nine
smelters have the capacity to produce nearly 1m tonnes a year, it is still a
net importer - 72,000 tonnes last year, down 59 per cent from 1989.
He says that it is very difficult to obtain a true picture of China's metal
production and consumption.
World Bureau statistics show 1990 demand for aluminium at 650,000 tonnes but
other sources suggest it was as high as 950,000 tonnes.
China is the fourth-largest non-ferrous metals producer in the world, in the
wake of the US, the former Soviet Union, and Canada.
The China National Non-ferrous Metals Industry Corporation was established
in 1983 and controls more than 300 base metals mines, of which about 11 are
large-scale, 1m-tonnes-per-year ore producers.

prospect

   KAMPALA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UGANDA may become a major cobalt producer by means of a Dollars 45m (Pounds
25.5m) deal now being discussed by the French mining group BRGM and Barclays
Metals to extract the stockpiled by-product of an abandoned copper mine in
the south west of the country, Reuters reports from Kampala.
Jeff Thomas, managing director of Barclays Bank Uganda, said in an interview
that the proposal was a further sign of confidence in the country's economic
recovery process. Mr Thomas said that the joint venture would release the
world's largest stockpile of the strategic material. He also confirmed that
talks were now at an advanced stage. 'We are now only awaiting government
go-ahead', he added.
If the deal goes ahead, Uganda will become one of the world's major cobalt
producers, along with Zaire and Zambia, which together account for about 70
per cent of global output outside former eastern bloc countries.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts continue to slide on fears over
Budget funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bond prices continued to drop yesterday on political worries
and concern over the funding implications of the forthcoming Budget.
Long-dated gilts fell by almost half a percentage point, partly on rumours
that an opinion poll due out today would show the opposition Labour party
five points ahead of the Conservative party in some key marginal seats. The
Labour lead in the opinion poll, which appears in the Local Government
Chronicle, was confirmed later yesterday.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 opened at 114 7/8 and traded
at 114 7/16 by late afternoon. The Liffe gilt futures contract fell from
96.16 to 96.06 - an important resistance level - but then recovered some of
the ground to end at 96.10. Trading volumes were heavy at 51,000 contracts.
Traders said sterling's weakness in the foreign exchange markets undermined
shorter-dated gilts, with the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 falling to 100 3/4
from 100 29/32 .
A decline in weekly jobless claims that exceeded market forecasts and
nervousness ahead of today's February employment data depressed US Treasury
prices at both ends of the yield curve yesterday.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  9/16 at 100
13/32 , yielding 7.957 per cent. The two-year note was also sharply lower,
down  7/32 at 99 17/32 , yielding 5.611 per cent.
The market was subdued primarily because many participants, especially on
the retail side, were reluctant to commit themselves to active trading ahead
of the key February employment report, which is due out today.
Prices slipped lower on the news that initial claims for state unemployment
insurance fell 21,000 in the third week of last month. The figures suggested
that today's February employment numbers would be broadly positive, and when
added to other recent data, indicated that the long-awaited economic
recovery may be underway.
JAPANESE government bonds ended stronger on short-covering after a report
that the Bank of Japan may cut the official discount rate by 75 basis points
after March 13.
According to a report from Johnson Smick International, the Washington-based
consultancy, the discount rate may be cut by 0.75 of a percentage point from
its current level of 4.5 per cent between March 13 and March 20.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, is due to return to
Japan on March 11 and many traders believe the central bank is unlikely to
cut interest rates while he is out of the country.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB opened on a firmer note at 5.445 per
cent, and closed at 5.40 per cent. The Bank of Japan's quarterly survey, due
out today is expected to show that Japanese companies still have a bearish
outlook on the economy, which would provide the central bank with an
incentive to ease rates.
STRONG industrial output figures for former West Germany announced yesterday
helped to push German government bond prices lower.
Industrial production in the area rose a provisional 5.9 per cent in January
from the previous month after a drop of 4.2 per cent in December. The figure
was much higher than expected.

FT  06 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Coles Myer angered by
downgrading

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOODY'S, the US credit rating service, yesterday downgraded the debt rating
of paper issued by a subsidiary of Coles Myer, Australia's biggest retailer,
provoking an immediate and fiery response from the company.
The downgrading affects about ADollars 1bn of paper issued by Coles Myer
Finance, reducing its rating from A1 to Aa3.
Moody's said the action was based on a view of a weak Australian economy,
more selective consumers and stronger competition.
These factors would 'make it difficult for Coles Myer to both regain the
grocery market share it has lost during the last few years and attempt to
increase profitability and cash flow', the agency said.
'The rating action also recognises management's steps to improve operations,
cut costs, maintain profitability and regain lost grocery market share.'
Mr Brian Quinn, Coles Myer managing director, last night described the
Moody's downgrading as extremely hard to justify. He said it was
'extraordinary' that a credit change had been issued one week before release
of the company's interim results.
'I would have thought the responsible course of action would have been to
wait and find out the facts of our performance before making a pre-emptive
judgment,' he said.

<TEXT>
THE Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) yesterday reported a net profit of
ADollars 1.1m for the six months to December 31, Reuter reports from Sydney.
It said higher revenue and a fall in expenditure had helped it return to
profit from last year's loss of ADollars 4.1m.
Revenue rose to ADollars 41.15 from ADollars 36.78m a year earlier while
expenditure fell to ADollars 36.84m from ADollars 41.28m.
The rise in revenue reflected increases from settlement fees, membership
charges and listing and company fees, Mr Laurie Cox, chairman, said. The
reduction in expenditure came from staff cuts and savings on equipment
costs.
The ASX said market capitalisation grew to ADollars 261bn during the period
from ADollars 196bn a year earlier. It said the strength of the market was
reflected in equity capital raisings which amounted to ADollars 5.5bn in the
six months, up from ADollars 3bn.
The largest capital raising was a partial float of the Commonwealth Bank of
Australia which raised ADollars 1.3bn. A rights issue by the National
Australia Bank raised ADollars 1bn. The ASX said 111 main board companies
had been delisted in the six months but 17 had been listed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IMPROVED lending margins helped Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce post an
11 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings, in spite of a rise in loan loss
provisions.
Canada's second biggest bank lifted earnings to CDollars 221m, (USDollars
187.2m) or CDollars 1.01 per share from CDollars 199m, or 98 cents a year
earlier. Return on common equity fell to 13.5 per cent from 14.2 per cent
due to increased preferred share financing. Return on average assets rose to
0.71 per cent from 0.67 per cent.
Net interest income rose to CDollars 922m from CDollars 818m, reflecting a
widening in interest rate margins to 3.05 per cent from 2.8 per cent.
The protracted domestic recession has led the bank to raise loan loss
provisions to CDollars 188m from CDollars 128m. CIBC estimated loan losses
for the year at CDollars 750m, against CDollars 613m in fiscal 1991.

FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: ITT 'unlikely to spin off
Hartford'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rand Araskog, chairman of ITT, said yesterday he was not considering a
break-up of the US conglomerate and was also most unlikely to spin off ITT's
Hartford insurance company as a separate unit.
Mr Araskog was speaking to reporters and analysts in the wake of ITT's
announcement this week that it will sell its remaining 30 per cent stake in
Alcatel, the French telecommunications group, to partner Alcatel Alsthom.
Shares in ITT have risen sharply following the Alcatel deal and publication
in late February of an interview with Mr Araskog in the Financial Times.
This quoted him as saying the company wanted to make itself more exciting to
investors.
It added that he had been considering the theoretical possibility of
separating its financial services operations and its manufacturing
operations.
Mr Araskog said yesterday that spinning off Hartford was 'not in the realm
of likelihood in my time.' He said the business was a critical part of ITT
and its largest single revenue and profit producer.
During the FT interview, conducted in early February, Mr Araskog had said:
'Now there is always the question as to what would happen if ITT became a
service company on the one hand and a manufacturing company on the other.'
Asked if he meant by this a possible split up, he replied affirmatively, but
went on to note that up till now the board had taken the view there were
good strengths back and forth within the group.
Yesterday, he promised analysts 'strikingly new and different things' from
ITT but refused to be drawn on what these might be, beyond hinting that it
might mean the company being a larger player in fewer areas.

FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: FDIC rejects Drexel proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the agency which oversees the US
thrift industry and which has filed multi-billion civil suits against Mr
Michael Milken, former head of the junk bond department at Drexel Burnham
Lambert, yesterday rejected a 'global settlement proposal'.
Under this, the mass of civil litigation arising from the collapse of the
once high-flying US investment bank would have been settled in one swoop. To
achieve the settlement, Mr Milken had offered to contribute another Dollars
500m to a settlement pool, while 200 of his former colleagues at Drexel
would provide Dollars 300m in Drexel employee partnership interests. The
pool to be split between the numerous claims would then amount to Dollars
1.3bn.
The FDIC was one of the largest and most powerful claimants, and its
rejection, if sustained, could throw the settlement plan into question. In a
letter, the FDIC said that it had voted to reject the proposal 'because it
did not provide for adequate or sufficient information upon which the board
could base an informed judgment'. The FDIC said it did not have enough
information about the relative contributions of the various settling
individuals, and their financial status. There have been suggestions that
the FDIC was worried that, if Mr Milken remains a rich man after the
settlement, it would been seen to have struck a poor bargain.
The Florida Department of Insurance weighed in yesterday with a lawsuit
against Mr Milken. The insurance regulators are seeking more than Dollars
225m on behalf of policyholders at Guarantee Security Life Insurance
Company, a small life company with about 57,000 policyholders.
It was seized by the regulators in August, 1991, and declared insolvent. The
Florida authorities have sued Merrill Lynch, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, and other
GSLI advisers with malpractice and aiding management in breach of fiduciary
duty.
In the suit against Mr Milken and his brother the insurance department
alleges that the duo violated federal securities law and Florida law by
manipulating the market in junk securities; 'misrepresenting and concealing
their actions to encourage participation by investors such as Guarantee in a
rigged market'; and aiding and abetting others in breaching their fiduciary
duty.
Meanwhile, the formal hearings which could approve a plan of reorganisation
for Drexel Burnham Lambert, which has been in bankruptcy since early 1990,
began in the US courts yesterday.

FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: General Cinema lifted by gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Cinema, the retailing, publishing and theatre group that last year
acquired Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (HBJ), the Florida-based publisher, said
net earnings in the quarter to January 31 were lifted by a Dollars 419.6m
after-tax extraordinary gain.
The one-time benefit was due mainly to the purchase of HBJ debt at a
discount as part of the acquisition.
Net income for the first quarter was Dollars 27.7m or 35 cents a share,
compared with a loss of Dollars 11.1m and 14 cents in the three months to
January 31, 1991. With the extraordinary item General Cinema's net profit
was Dollars 447.2m.
Revenues declined to Dollars 883m from Dollars 886.6m a year ago. Operating
profits were Dollars 44.3m against Dollars 45.9m last time.
Mr Robert Tarr, chief executive, said the results were the first indication
of General Cinema's earnings potential following the HBJ acquisition.
Interest expenses fell to Dollars 22.4m from Dollars 87m a year ago.
Operating earnings from the 63 per cent-owned Neiman Marcus department store
chain were Dollars 10.8m, against Dollars 13.2m - these earnings will be
consolidated into General Cinema's second quarter.
Operating profits from General Cinema's retail division were Dollars 25.6m,
down from Dollars 30.5m. Publishing income increased to Dollars 9.9m from
Dollars 5m while theatre income dropped to Dollars 6m, from Dollars 8.3m.
On Wall Street, General Cinema rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 21 3/8 .

<TEXT>
THE GAP, the fast-growing US fashion chain, yesterday announced a sharp 49
per cent improvement in fourth-quarter profits, to Dollars 83.9m after tax,
compared with Dollars 56.5m in the same period a year earlier.
The profits advance came on sales of Dollars 803.5m, against Dollars 624.7m
in the three months to February 2, 1991. However, part of the rise derives
from the expansion of the chain - which operates 1,216 stores - while
same-store sales increased by 12 per cent.
The fourth-quarter figures leave The Gap with profits of Dollars 229.9m
after tax for the year. In 1990-91, the figure was Dollars 144.5m.
Net sales for the year were Dollars 2.52bn, up from Dollars 1.93bn last
time. Comparable store sales increased by 13 per cent.
Although at the earnings per share level, the results were roughly in line
with expectations, The Gap shares fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 45 3/4 on
the news.
The Gap figures came as many big US retailers posted their sales figures for
February - showing a mixed bag of results, particularly when the effect of
the Iraq conflict on last year's figures is borne in mind. The Gap revealed
a 7 per cent improvement from comparable stores. The star remained Wal-Mart,
the Arkansas-based discount retailer which posted an overall sales gain of
34 per cent, and a sharp 20 per cent rise on a same store basis.
At Neiman Marcus, the rise was 5.7 per cent; at JC Penney, 8.6 per cent;
Dayton Hudson, 6 per cent and Sears Roebuck, 8.9 per cent (all on a
comparable store basis).
Not everyone fared this well; at May Department Stores, same store sales
were up by 4 per cent overall, while Woolworth managed a modest 3.1 per cent
from domestic comparable stores.
RH Macy plans to close five I Magnin stores, all its Fantasies by Morgan
Taylor speciality stores and several other stores in its speciality store
divisions in order to improve operating performance, Reuters reports from
New York.
After the closures, it will have 19 I Magnins.
Macy said that it will focus the chain in the west coast and desert resort
areas.
The company said that it will close three of its 37 Aeropostale speciality
stores, about 15 of its 35 Charter Club speciality stores, and all its 34
Fantasies stores.

LIFE SCIENCES International, the scientific instruments company, bucked the
continuing recession in the US, its largest market, by reporting a 29 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 18.5m for the year to December
31.
Sales increased from Pounds 74.5m to Pounds 91.8m. Trading margins continued
to strengthen, rising from 16 to 17.8 per cent.
Mr Christopher Bland, chairman, said the results demonstrated 'the
recession-resistant characteristic both of our divisions and the markets
they serve.'
Shandon, the tissues analysis business, showed a substantial increase in
profits. Mr Bland said the company's earnings had also benefited from an
effective treasury operation.
Net debt of Pounds 8.3m, following the Dollars 46m (Pounds 26.1m) purchase
of Neslab, a New Hampshire temperature control company, decreased to Pounds
2.4m at the year end, representing 7 per cent of shareholders' funds.
Although the company's tax charge increased to 27 per cent from 25 per cent,
it still remained lower than the average because of the struct-uring of the
company's acquisitions.
A final dividend of 2.2p, makes a 3.35p (2.9p) total. Earnings per share
rose to 8.8p (7.6p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jupiter Tyndall Group announced that the proposals for the merger of CST
Emerging Asia Trust and Pacific Horizon Investment Trust, both managed by
Jupiter, have been withdrawn.
The board of CST, which has been advised by Robert Fleming, rejected the
draft merger proposals for three principal reasons:
The value realisable by CST's shareholders as a result of the proposals was
uncertain and unlikely to exceed 85 per cent of net asset value;
PHIT's portfolio and performance, in terms of the decline in net assets per
share since launch, provided no grounds for selecting PHIT as a merger
partner;
And the cost of the proposals would be excessive and significant in relation
to the assets of CST and PHIT.

Reducing costs and minimising exposure to bad debts and adverse currency
movements helped enhance margins at Holders Technology, the supplier of
tools, materials and equipment to the printed circuit board industry.
Pre-tax profits were static at Pounds 380,000, against Pounds 378,000, on
turnover down from Pounds 3.73m to Pounds 2.98m.
Mr Rudolf Weinreich, chairman and chief executive of this USM-quoted
company, said that the UK economy had made no improvement, discernible
either to Holders or to its customers, in the second half. Given this he
regarded the result as 'satisfactory'.
Indeed the recession had spread to the Continent and had stifled progress in
Germany and the Netherlands.
Earnings rose fractionally to 8.56p (8.51p) per share; the proposed final
dividend is unchanged at 4p to make a maintained total of 6p.

FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Readymix declines to IPounds 3.63m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'1991 was a year of mixed fortunes' for Readymix, the Dublin-based concrete
and building materials group, with pre-tax profits declining from IPounds
4.85m to IPounds 3.63m (Pounds 3.38m).
Moreover, the company said that 'the final outcome was somewhat better than
could have been anticipated from the first six months, when profits fell 25
per cent to IPounds 1.76m.
It added that the year had seen 'a return to more normal levels of
construction activity after the exceptionally buoyant conditions experienced
in 1990'. In terms of profits and earnings per share, 1991 had been the
company's second best year.
Turnover slipped to IPounds 31.7m (IPounds 32.2m). While major road
projects, sanitary services and industrial development had maintained
'reasonable levels of demand', housing, agriculture and commercial
developments were weak.
Earnings shed 2.78p to 8.05p per share and the final dividend is lifted to a
proposed 2.2p for a total of 2.75p (2.5p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS of MTL Instruments Group rose from Pounds 3.77m to Pounds 4.61m
pre-tax for 1991. The 22 per cent improvement was achieved on the back of a
Pounds 4m rise in turnover to Pounds 18m.
The USM-quoted company, a maker of electrical instruments and control
systems, is raising the year's dividend by 21 per cent to 3.4p with a
proposed 1.9p final. Earnings amounted to 16.6p (13.69p) per share.
An extraordinary credit of Pounds 552,000 represented a pension scheme
surplus in respect of a pension fund established for one of the founder
directors.

FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Pentland triples annual dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER

<TEXT>
PENTLAND GROUP, which made its fortune from an investment in Reebok, the US
sports shoe maker, yesterday tripled its dividend for the year after
announcing higher-than-expected profits.
The company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.6m for 1991. The figure is
not comparable with 1990 because of the disposal of the Reebok stake in
February and December. The sale raised about Pounds 388.9m and contributed
to extraordinary profits of Pounds 207m.
Because of the sale, the company restated its accounts for 1990, treating
Reebok as an investment. Following this change, 1990 pre-tax profits on
continuing operations were reduced from Pounds 55.3m to Pounds 8.7m.
Earnings per share were 4.71p (2.36p). A recommended final dividend of
1.3125p makes a total of 2.25p (0.75p).
The company had net cash of Pounds 273m at December 31 and in 1991 earned
Pounds 6.3m in interest income (charge Pounds 7.9m). Mr Stephen Rubin,
chairman, said: 'It really is good to be cash rich in the current climate.'
Pentland completed two acquisitions last year and is continuing to look for
targets.
In August, it paid Pounds 46.1m for a 20.05 per cent stake in Adidas, the
German sporting goods company controlled by Mr Bernard Tapie, the French
entrepreneur. Mr Rubin said Pentland had an option to take a further 5 per
cent between 1993 and 1996. The stake has not been equity-accounted and is
being treated as an investment.
Pentland would probably like to increase its stake further if the chance
arose, for example if Mr Tapie needed to sell another tranche. But Mr Rubin
admitted the matter was outside his control.
Speedo, the swimwear brand of which Pentland bought the worldwide rights and
various distributors, is being built up. Distribution has been extended to
eight new countries.
Pentland's shares gained 4p to 101p.

FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Confidence on a wing and a prayer in
current turbulence - Rolls-Royce's long-term approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOSSES incurred in its core aero-engine business last year did not
appear to dampen Rolls-Royce spirits yesterday.
Indeed Sir Ralph Robins, chief executive and deputy chairman, said the
company was plugging on with its long-term strategy of expanding the range
of its commercial jet engines, coping with the reduction in the defence
market, and broadening the group's operations in other industrial power
sectors to reduce dependence on the aerospace market.
Both Sir Ralph and Lord Tombs, chairman, made it abundantly clear that
Rolls-Royce was not seeking any strategic alliance with either General
Electric (GE) and Pratt &amp; Whitney, its two principal US competitors.
Instead, the UK company was determined to 'go it alone' and to continue
broadening its market base to secure a 30 per cent share of the commercial
jet engine market by the mid-1990s.
Rolls-Royce, like other aerospace companies, suffered last year from the
combined effects of the post-Cold War decline in military business and the
slump in civil aviation. Short-term prospects remain uncertain. Sir Ralph
conceded yesterday that there was little chance this year of a recovery in
civil aero-engine spares business which has traditionally been a significant
source of profits for aircraft engine manufacturers.
However, the company believes it is now in a better position than in the
past to take advantage of a recovery in the commercial aircraft business
because of its expanded range of civil engines. This is reflected in its
order book which has grown from Pounds 2.8bn in 1987, when the company was
privatised, to Pounds 6.6bn last year. It has also taken vigorous action to
reduce costs with 7,000 job cuts last year and plans for a further 3,000 job
reductions this year.
The company's broader civil engine product line has helped Rolls-Royce
increase its share of both the US and Asia-Pacific commercial engine
markets. The company is expected to win soon a big engine order from Cathay
Pacific, the Hong Kong-based airline, and is also competing for a big engine
order from Japan Air Lines and Korean Air.
However, its weakness remains in Europe, where it has failed so far to make
any significant market inroads with big continental European carriers, apart
from British Airways. The company is still smarting from last year's loss of
BA's engine order for the UK carrier's fleet of Boeing 777 widebodies which
went to GE.
Lord Tombs expects that the recent aero-engine joint venture Rolls-Royce
established with BMW, the German luxury car maker, will eventually enable
the company to increase its European penetration. The current talks between
Deutsche Aerospace and Fokker, whose jet engines are supplied by
Rolls-Royce, could also boost the prospects of the Rolls-Royce Tay engine.
At the same time, the UK company, which has already sold engines to Iberia,
believes it has potential sales opportunities with airlines like Lufthansa,
Swissair and Alitalia.
Lord Tombs also defended yesterday his decision six years ago to break off a
co-operation agreement with GE. Although some analysts still argue that
there is not room for three big engine makers in the market, Lord Tombs
argued that the GE deal would have limited the UK company's longer-term
aero-engine prospects and ultimately turned Rolls-Royce into a GE
sub-contractor.
By concentrating on developing its own expanded range of engines and
maintaining a strong balance sheet to weather the cyclical downturns, Lord
Tombs believed Rolls-Royce was now in a far stronger position to compete in
the cut-throat aero-engine market. He added that the company had spent
Pounds 2bn on research and development to develop its expanded engine range
during the last six years. This includes the Pounds 600m the company is
investing in its new heavy thrust Trent engine to power the new generation
of widebody aircraft.
Broadening the company's base in other industrial power sectors had also
started to pay dividends.
Indeed, the industrial power division produced the bulk of profits last year
and now accounted for about 40 per cent of the group's overall turnover.
Both Lord Tombs and Sir Ralph insisted yesterday that the company should be
viewed as a long-term business. 'When we were floated we said investors
would have to be patient; that we needed a strong balance sheet to weather
the cold spells in the industry,' Lord Tombs said.
Yesterday's figures and the aerospace industry's uncertain short-term
prospects suggest that investors will have to continue being patient.

FT  06 MAR 92 / O&amp;Y to raise CDollars 160m from sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York, the property developer owned by Toronto's Reichmann family,
is to raise about CDollars 160m (Pounds 78.4m) by selling its controlling
interest in Interprovincial Pipe Line, which operates the world's longest
network of oil pipelines.
Separately, O&amp;Y has redeemed CDollars 240m of a CDollars 500m commercial
paper programme, after some investors stopped reinvesting in the issues
following its downgrading last month.
The Dominion Bond Rating Service cut the rating from R1 middle to R1 low,
which is towards the bottom of its investment grade ratings.
The downgrading resulted from the weakness of the shares on which the
programme is secured - namely Trizec, the property company, Trilon, the
financial services holding company, and GW Utilities, a holding company.
Over the next two to three months, O&amp;Y will wind up the programme which is
used as a source of general funds.
O&amp;Y's subsidiary, GW Utilities, said yesterday it was selling its 63.5 per
cent stake in Interprovincial to an underwriting group led by ScotiaMcLeod
of Toronto for CDollars 26 a share, or CDollars 655m. Most of the net
proceeds of CDollars 625m will be used to pay down debt. GW Utilities said
it also plans to declare a special dividend of about CDollars 4.50 a share.
O&amp;Y owns just over 35m shares in GWU, or 89 per cent.
The Interprovincial sale marks the latest in a series of cash-raising
measures by O&amp;Y to offset financial strains in its property operations,
which include London's Canary Wharf project as well as large holdings in New
York and other North American cities.
O&amp;Y is a private company and declines to disclose details of its financial
situation. It received special dividends of CDollars 175m last month by
spinning off much of Interprovincial's US assets into a limited partnership.
Interprovincial's shares were trading at CDollars 27.75 before yesterday's
announcement. The underwriting group plans to offer the shares bought from
GW Utilities to the public on an instalment basis.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Ladbroke declines 29% to Pounds 210m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUCED property values and a decline in betting-shop income lay behind a 29
per cent fall in annual pre-tax profit, from Pounds 296.5m to Pounds 210.4m,
at Ladbroke Group, the UK leisure concern.
Early 1991 was marked by warnings from Mr Cyril Stein, chairman, that the
Gulf crisis had wiped out first-quarter profit in the Hilton International
hotel chain. He was more upbeat about the start to this year.
Ladbroke, which raised Pounds 464m in a debt-reducing rights issue in
August, was also affected by recessions in the UK and US, with the property
division the worst hit. It fell to a loss after interest of Pounds 12.4m,
compared with Pounds 45.2m profit. Most of the turnround was accounted for
by write-downs in values.
A small profit was made in the second half through sales.
Group operating profit declined 15 per cent to Pounds 312.2m on flat
turnover of Pounds 3.79bn. Interest charges, including a supplement for
convertible bonds, rose to Pounds 101.8m from Pounds 69.4m. There was a
compensating reduction in capitalised interest to Pounds 34.1m, from Pounds
70.9m, as projects were completed and let.
Hotels - 153 in 50 countries - remained the group's biggest contributor to
operating profit at Pounds 163.8m, more than Pounds 10m down on 1990, with
turnover reduced to Pounds 758.1m. The figures were helped by Pounds 43.7m
of profits from hotel sales against Pounds 20.8m last year.
Operating profit from Ladbroke's betting businesses fell 30 per cent to
Pounds 64.5m on turnover of Pounds 2.25bn (against Pounds 2.3bn). The main
area of weakness was credit betting, which suffered a 'loss of high-staking
punters'.
Star performer was Texas Homecare, the DIY chain second to Kingfisher's B&amp;Q.
Retail operating profit rose 20 per cent to Pounds 47.5m on sales of Pounds
652.9m. Mr Stein said Texas increased market share to about 25 per cent of
the DIY superstore sector and improved its margins.
Net debt, benefiting from the issue proceeds fell to Pounds 1.12bn from
Pounds 1.49bn, and gearing was 38 per cent. Capital spending came down from
Pounds 490m to Pounds 220m, with Pounds 180m planned for this year.
Writedowns in property and hotel values taken straight to the balance sheet
amounted to Pounds 18.2m and Pounds 56.2m respectively.
After a final dividend of 6.23p, the total rises 5 per cent to 11.15p. This
is 1.4 times covered by earnings per share of 16.12p, down from 24.49p.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Rolls-Royce pre-tax profits fall 71% to Pounds 51m: Shares
rise as group maintains dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine and industrial power group, yesterday reported
a 71 per cent drop in pre-tax profits last year but expressed confidence in
its long-term prospects by maintaining its dividend.
The decline in defence spending and the slump in the civil aviation industry
were responsible for the sharp decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 51m last
year from Pounds 176m in 1990.
The company's core aerospace activities lost Pounds 6m last year, against a
profit of Pounds 81m the year before. The group's industrial power
activities also reported lower profits of Pounds 73m last year, down from
Pounds 102m in 1990.
The decline in profits also included a Pounds 58m restructuring charge to
cover the 7,000 job cuts the company made last year. Sir Ralph Robins, chief
executive, confirmed yesterday the company expected to reduce its workforce
further this year by 3,000.
Group sales declined 4 per cent last year to Pounds 3.5bn from Pounds 3.67bn
the year before. Sales in the aerospace division fell 13 per cent to Pounds
2.033bn but increased 11 per cent in the industrial power division to Pounds
1.482bn.
The company decided to maintain its final dividend at 4.7p a share making an
unchanged total dividend for the year of 7.25p a share. Although the company
has had to resort to its reserves to cover the dividend payment, Lord Tombs,
chairman, said the decision reflected the company's confidence in its
future. Earnings per share were 2 1/2 p, against 13.9p in 1990.
The decision to maintain an unchanged dividend after speculation of a
possible cut helped lift Rolls-Royce shares which closed 6p higher at 146p
in a generally weak market.
'We have continued to strengthen our position in highly competitive
international markets,' Lord Tombs said.
The company maintained a strong balance sheet with year-end net cash of
Pounds 52m (Pounds 170m in 1990) and an increased order book of Pounds 6.6bn
(Pounds 5.7bn in 1990).
Research and development spending was Pounds 216m - lower than the 1990 peak
of Pounds 237m. Lord Tombs said he expected annual R&amp;D spending to average 8
per cent of turnover.
The group's industrial power activities now accounted for more than 40 per
cent of sales. Military business had declined to around 20 per cent of group
sales last year.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Barclays may lose its premium debt rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS Bank, the biggest UK bank, is expected to lose its AAA rating for
long-term debt, following the decision yesterday by two of the world's
leading credit rating agencies, Moody's and IBCA, to review their ratings of
the UK bank.
The AAA rating is the highest possible and is given to the world's strongest
banks. Barclays had been the only UK bank to retain its premium rating: its
nearest rival, National Westminster, has an AA-plus rating.
It is rare that a bank retains its original rating when the rating agencies
put it under review. 'Barclays is going down to AA-plus,' predicted an
analyst.
Moody's of the US and IBCA, the European-based rating agency, are among the
world's leading rating agencies. The other leader, Standard &amp; Poor's of the
US, downgraded Barclays to AA-plus a year ago.
IBCA said the decision to review Barclays' debt rating followed analysis of
full-year results unveiled on February 26. These showed a 30 per cent fall
in pre-tax profits to Pounds 533m and a sharp increase in loan-loss
provisions.
The rating agency conducted a similar review last year but decided to
maintain the top rating on the grounds that economic recovery would cut
domestic loan losses. However, the economic upturn did not arrive.
Mr David Andrews, an IBCA director, said Barclays' costs were running at a
higher level than some rivals.
Barclays' ratio of costs-to-income, a key measure of productivity, rose to
67.8 per cent, from 65.7 per cent in 1990. The cost-income ratios of the
other three UK clearing banks fell last year.
Moody's said its review would focus on the impact of a deterioration in the
quality of Barclays' loan book and also on the strength of its balance
sheet.
In 1991, Barclays made provisions of Pounds 1.758bn to cover the risk of
losses on loans. Only NatWest suffered a bigger bad debt charge. However,
Barclays' bad debt provisions were smaller than all the other banks as a
proportion of its UK portfolio of loans.
Some analysts fear that its rivals may simply be suffering from bad debts
earlier than Barclays and that Barclays may continue to suffer from high
loan losses longer than them.
Moody's also said it would assess Barclays' 'competitive environment and its
domestic and international strategies'.

FT  06 MAR 92 / BIS chief warns of world financial crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WARNING that the world might be at risk of financial crisis came last
night from Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of the Bank for
International Settlements, the central bankers' bank.
Mr Lamfalussy said at the City University in London that a crisis could be
triggered by the pace of financial deregulation over the past few years,
unstable asset prices and a lack of transparency in financial systems.
Mr Lamfalussy, highly respected in the international financial community and
a long-time advocate of prudence in monetary and fiscal policy, said the
changes in the financial world in recent years had created 'fertile ground
for full-blown crises'.
He said the removal of regulatory barriers which had provided new sources of
finance for many individuals and organisations had brought 'numerous
benefits' from the vantage point of users of financial services.
But the downside was the 'systemic risk' that such a process involved for
shaking the foundations of stable money and asset prices on which the
financial services industry was based.
In a world in which huge amounts of money could be shifted between
organisations in seconds using modern telecommunications networks, 'you have
prime ingredients for an environment in which financial asset prices become
more unstable, adding to the dangers of increased fragility'.
Mr Lamfalussy also said he was worried by the 'increasing opaqueness' of
many financial systems.
The scope for off-balance sheet accounting and 'creating hitherto unknown
linkages' between different parts of the financial services industry
produced an environment which may have had a part in the emergence of the
Maxwell and Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandals, he said.
With many aspects of the world financial system tending towards instability,
Mr Lamfalussy said it was essential for national central banks to create
conditions of sound, non-inflationary growth.
'They should actively contribute to the creation of a macroeconomic
environment which minimises the risk of a global crisis,' he said.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Rogue PC virus starts to spread a day early
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR millions of personal computer (PC) users around the world, turning on
the familiar desktop machine this morning could be a moment of truth. The
widely feared Michelangelo computer virus is set to strike today, wiping out
data files on infected computers. It was already reported yesterday to have
hit some US companies.
The level of concern over Michelangelo, however, varies from country to
country. While anxiety is muted in the UK, it is widespread Germany and in
the US where data files in PCs at more than a dozen companies were yesterday
reported to have been destroyed.
'Users have come in and turned their systems on and everything's gone,' said
Mr John McAfee, chairman of the Computer Virus Industry Association, a US
monitoring group. An Argentine newspaper, the Bariloche, was reported to
have lost computer data files.
In the UK, Mr John McIntosh of PC Security, a consultancy specialising in
antiviral software, played down the risks. He said he expected a few victims
today but not a flood. The level of infection was about equal, he thought,
to the notorious 'Friday the 13th' virus which wiped out records at the
National Institute for the Blind last year but did little other damage.
There can be little cause for complacency, however. Viruses have caused
damage - in time and trade lost - measuring in six figures.
Those who have yet to take precautions against Michelangelo face the choice
of risking destruction of files stored on computer hard disks, or giving up
an essential business tool for 24 hours. Only when the computer is turned on
is the virus activated. Michelangelo is triggered by the 'clock' inside a
personal computer.
The Michelangelo virus is the latest in an epidemic of rogue programs
created by computer hackers.
It is set to attack today, on the anniversary of the Italian Renaissance
artist's birth.
Computer stores have been overwhelmed in the past few days by demand for
'disinfectant' programs designed to eradicate the virus. But just how
widespread the infection may be is unknown.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAUNCH of a government booklet on sexual harassment backfired yesterday
as Mr Robert Jackson, employment minister, incurred the wrath of the Equal
Opportunities Commission by claiming that wolf whistles and pin-up calendars
were 'acceptable in certain circumstances'.
The timing of Mr Jackson's comments is unfortunate, given the government's
current efforts to strengthen its appeal to female voters.
New policies on after-school care for children and extra help for families
under stress were launched last weekend. On Tuesday Mr Jackson lectured
business on 'morally wrong' discrimination as he publicised a new government
equal opportunities guide.
At yesterday's launch of the sexual harassment booklet, Mr Jackson said it
was impossible to provide a checklist of actions that would constitute
harassment because that could 'lead down the road of political correctness'.
Wolf whistles and pin-ups might be acceptable in a 'totally all-male
environment where no woman will stray', he said.
Following Mr Jackson's comments, the EOC said: 'We can't think of any
circumstances where it would be acceptable.' A resolution from the European
Community, to which Britain had been a signatory, specifically mentioned
pin-ups and wolf whistles as things that were likely to be offensive to
women, the EOC said.
Ms Clare Short, Labour MP and campaigner against pin-ups, said Mr Jackson's
words 'exposed the government's complete hypocrisy'. The launch of the
booklet had been 'in order to buy women's votes', she said. Pornography in
the workplace gave women the message they should not be there, she added.
Mr Jackson confessed it was not until last summer, when he had sat next to
the chief executive of a large company at a function, that he had taken the
issue of sexual harassment seriously. The chief executive had told him of
his own company's experiences of dealing with a case.
According to Mr Jackson, there was no detailed information on the incidence
of sexual harassment at work although 'anecdotally' it appeared to be quite
a significant problem.
The EOC said there was no need to rely on anecdotal evidence: surveys
already showed the extent of the problem.
Mr Jackson is no stranger to the gaff: his most famous faux pas was in 1990
when he told security staff at Heathrow airport that the case he was
carrying was 'full of bombs'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The currency markets gave a nasty hint yesterday of what could happen if
government support really starts crumbling in the opinion polls. Sterling
fell below DM2.87 at one stage, even though the German currency was again
lower against the dollar. The risk has resurfaced of a vicious circle with
sterling weakening on political worries which are then compounded because of
the government's inability to cut interest rates. It matters little that the
bogeymen appear to be the white socks brigade in the City rather than
foreign investors, who are much less frightened by Labour than they were in
the 1970s. The chancellor must be feeling even more boxed in as he puts the
final touches to next week's Budget.

is crisply written, and highlights Steetley's strengths; but at this late
stage few will be convinced by the company's case for an independent future.
Its argument that Redland is buying valuable market shares in aggregates on
the cheap, though, merits further attention. Redland has done its level best
to undermine the asset revaluation, but even with a disappointingly low
figure of 394p, which is questionable on the inclusion of landfill and
surplus ACT, the bidder is arguably not paying a big premium for control.
Turning to the more meaningful question of earnings potential, the issue is
when Steetley will again achieve the profit levels of the last five years.
Given a fair wind - and assuming that landfill realises its full potential -
this is certainly possible by 1994. At least a more generous cash
alternative from Redland may be needed to convince doubters that it is not
worth waiting to see.

FT  06 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: PolyGram
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Philips may have omitted its dividend last week, but there is no denying the
contribution to its finances from PolyGram. Small wonder it says it has no
intention of reducing its 80 per cent stake. Despite an acquisition spree
last year, the music and entertainment subsidiary increased its earnings by
a quarter and yesterday raised its dividend by a fifth. Its US businesses
made an operating profit, while the return from the 30 per cent stake in
Really Useful Group more than covered the investment's six-month financing
costs.
It is curious that worldwide recession did not put more of a brake on
consumers' appetite for music and video. But PolyGram appears capable for
the moment of competing with the world's entertainment giants, even though
its integrated marketing strategy is still in its infancy. In the long term,
the picture is less clear. With global stars demanding huge contracts which
rank them as corporations in their own right, the stakes are ballooning to
the point that a shakeout seems inevitable. PolyGram's list of new talent is
long enough to suggest it has a good chance of survival. Assuming Philips
holds on until it thinks otherwise, investors should take their cue from the
parent.

FT  06 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Ladbroke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The initial impression from Ladbroke's results is not encouraging. The 29
per cent fall in pre-tax profits would have been greater were it not for
Pounds 44m earned on the sale of two provincial hotels in the UK. Net
borrowings would have risen by about Pounds 100m without the Pounds 464m
rights issue. The racing business, which should be richly cash generative,
had a bad year, leaving Texas Homecare as the only good performer.
That said, the hotel division is now showing signs of recovery, though
activity is not back to the 1990 level. Ladbroke's policy of selling off
hotels while retaining a management contract will alleviate the cash burden
of expanding this sector - a further Pounds 40m or so of sales is expected
this year. Similarly the company also managed to generate profits of Pounds
20m last year by disposing of property at prices above current downgraded
book values.
Indeed, if Ladbroke really has been as conservative as it claims in valuing
its property portfolio, then the worries which have led its shares to
underperform the market by 30 per cent over the past two years may finally
be on the wane. But, despite the sales, its portfolio is still large, valued
at roughly Pounds 1bn, and one whose value has mostly to be taken on trust.
With a holding that includes 500,000 sq ft of unlet space in the UK and more
than 800,000 in the US, Ladbroke is still a hostage of the property market.
Despite the 2 per cent rise in its shares yesterday it would not do for
investors to get carried away until that market improves.

FT  06 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Forward thrust at Rolls-Royce
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,538.3 (-20.1)
The story that came out of Rolls-Royce yesterday was certainly not that of a
defensive company humiliated at the hands of British Airways. Chairman Lord
Tombs is a wily old bird, of course, and employed unusual openness in his
effort to show that last year's widely publicised order setback was in
contrast to progress elsewhere. Even so, it is hard not to be impressed by
his forecast that civil engine deliveries next year will be more than double
the number achieved in 1987, by the steady growth in Rolls' market share,
and by the relentless if inescapable attack on costs.
Investors should always bear in mind that engine salesmen are among the
world's great optimists, and ought to brace themselves for at least another
year when Rolls' industrial power tail will wag the aerospace dog in profit
terms. That said, the shares look an interesting bet on the recovery and
even with a lower yield look more exciting than the likes of BICC and GKN,
which also maintained their dividends this week. Increased payouts look a
long way off in those two companies, but given a fair wind there is just a
chance that Rolls might get its cover back above two times in 1993.
Demand for spares will ultimately receive a boost from the bigger installed
engine base, as well as a cyclical kick. The company is wisely not setting
any store by 1992, but given the 9 per cent growth in monthly traffic which
its old friends at BA reported yesterday compared with February two years
ago, Rolls might conceivably be too prudent this time.

FT  06 MAR 92 / The lure of oil's final frontier: Prospects for foreign
investors in the oilfields of the former Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the Caspian Sea to Sakhalin Island in Russia's far east, western oil
companies are eyeing hungrily the world's last oil and gas frontier. Home to
an estimated 40 per cent of the world's remaining unexploited reserves, the
oil and gas fields of the republics of the former Soviet Union, are
encouraging a queue of potential foreign investors.
'This is one of the last areas of the world where there are huge quantities
of oil and gas to be discovered,' says an executive at one oil company.
Foreign industry executives are examining the potential for investment. Mr
John Wakeham, the UK energy secretary, today winds up a tour to two former
Soviet republics where he led a party of British businessmen eager to pursue
deals in the energy sector.
Such western visitors have found a receptive audience. For Russia and three
smaller republics - Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan - foreign
capital and expertise is vital to develop their oil fields and secure a
valuable source of hard currency.
In a typically Soviet paradox, one of Russia's most lucrative industries and
its biggest export earner has been run down by decades of under-investment
in equipment and by inefficiencies arising from centralised management from
Moscow.
The result has been a marked decline in the sector. Crude oil output in
Russia, which accounts for 80 per cent of production in the former Soviet
Union, is expected to fall to 400m tonnes this year from 450m tonnes in
1991, and 505m tonnes in 1990. Exports projected at 100m tonnes this year
will be 50 per cent down on last year's level, and half what they were in
1990.
Having rid itself of ideological barriers to capitalism, Moscow is now
taking steps to encourage the investment in the oil industry which is badly
needed to arrest its decline. But the rush by western oil companies into the
republics has so far yielded only a few big deals - and they are still on
paper.
To date, foreign investment in the oil sector is estimated at Dollars 200m -
a relatively small figure by the standards of the international oil
industry. There are only 20 relatively small oil joint ventures registered
in the Russian republic, of which only 16 are operating.
Despite the government's efforts, a host of political and legislative
obstacles still stand in the way of large-scale investment.
First, there is the intractable problem of the instability gripping Russia
and other republics as they endeavour to make the transition to a capitalist
economy. The Russian government, which started to implement an ambitious
programme of market reforms in January, may yet fall. Any benefits it may
grant foreign investors may be removed.
'Before they put vast amounts of money into this country, foreign companies
are going to need assurances that the environment is stable enough to
justify the investment of billions of dollars,' says Mr Byron Ratliff, a
Moscow-based oil expert for Price Waterhouse, the management consultancy.'
Until the political system is stabilised, the search for high returns and
quick paybacks will take precedence over the long-term investments in
development that the industry needs. Opportunities provided by the sheer
waste of oil - a third is lost through leaky pipes, wasteful refineries, and
inefficient factories - means that most investment in the near future will
continue to concentrate on small but highly profitable projects. Such
projects include replacing pipes and reopening wells which have been closed
for lack of spare parts.
Problems of uncertainty extend into the legislative arena. The absence of
complete taxation legislation, and of precise rules on production-sharing
has contributed to the challenge of doing business in Russia's oil industry.
The law on mineral rights passed last month filled many gaps by setting out
basic rules on ownership of resources and the share-out of royalties between
federal, regional and local authorities. But the interpretation of these
rules will be problematic as long as conflicts remain between federal and
local government.
The confusion over where real power lies is vividly illustrated by the
squabbles surrounding the awarding of a feasibility study into the huge
reserves off Sakhalin Island in the Far East. After long delays due to
arguments between federal and local authorities, the contract was awarded to
a US-Japanese consortium composed of McDermott, the engineering company,
Marathon Oil Company and Japan's Mitsui. But after a protest by the island's
governor, Mr Valentin Fyodoconsortium, the Russian government's choice has
been referred to parliament, which is expected to produce its views next
Monday.
The problems arising from disputes about where authority lies apply in many
of Russia's oil-rich areas. While Tatarstan, an oil-rich autonomous republic
within Russia, plans to hold a referendum on whether to declare independence
on March 21, the largest oil-producing region in Russia, Tyumen, does not
even pretend to obey Moscow. Local oil barons who run the state-owned
enterprises in Tyumen, have boycotted the Russian government's plans to
incorporate all producers into a consortium.
But despite the many serious problems, it is already possible for foreign
oil companies to clinch substantial deals. Elf-Aquitaine, the French oil
group, which last month became the first and only company to sign
production-sharing deals - enabling it to develop oil fields without the
participation of a local partner - is in many ways a model of success. It
appears to have obtained the best of both worlds, as rival companies will
privately admit.
Elf plans to spend between Dollars 400m-Dollars 500m on exploration costs in
each of its two deals - based respectively in Kazakhstan's Aktiubinsk area
and the Saratov-Volgograd region in Russia. If exploration at these sites
goes well over the next few years, Elf plans to invest heavily in
production.
'Either you sit back and wait until everything is perfect, or you start
playing. We chose not to wait,' said the Elf executive in Moscow. 'In the
absence of legislation, we have been forced to put together a certain number
of rules under which we expect to play the game for another 30 years.'
It has, for instance, tailored its deals so that the local partners pay all
tax bills, whatever they may be in future, from their own share of the
profits.
But even if Elf's success is followed by dozens of other deals, foreign
investment is only part of the solution for the ailing oil industry of the
former Soviet Union. Dr Yevgeny Khartukov, an oil industry analyst who heads
the World Energy Analysis and Forecasting Group, a research institute in
Moscow, says the industry must also be taken out of state control.
He says a priority is to give managers the freedom to manage, and to train
them to operate in a market environment. 'They do not understand what
foreign partners expect of them. They are pure technocrats, not
businessmen.'
He also says that workers need better pay and conditions. 'After decades of
feeling privileged compared to other sectors, the oil workers realise they
too are poor. They have no access to the wealth they produce.'
To deal with some of the discontent and waste, Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's
deputy prime minister, proposes to unleash market forces upon the industry.
Last week he announced plans to free the price of oil for deliveries to the
state in mid-April. Faced with a strike threat, the government last month
allowed oil enterprises to sell 40 per cent of the oil they produce on the
country's fledgling free market. After halting spontaneous privatisation -
whereby oil managers simply took over state assets for themselves - the
government is now promising orderly, privatisation to create independent oil
companies.
Reform will take time but is unlikely to be reversed. Even if the current
government falls, the incentives for its successors to protect foreign
investment will remain strong. As for the internal squabbles over control of
resources, these may diminish over time as lines of authority become more
clearly defined and as oil industry assets are moved out of state hands.

FT  06 MAR 92 / King Kong antics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British politicians like their parliaments supine. One party supplies a
prime minister, he or she chooses a cabinet and off they go. They
nationalise, privatise, introduce a poll tax, take it back, reshape
education, health and the social services, and reshape them again, muddle,
cancel, restore, cut, spend, bribe and never forget to work away at the
fulfilment of the Treasury's purpose, which is to run the economy into the
ground at regular intervals. This is called 'strong government'. King Kong
is strong; the great ape should be draped around Big Ben.
The game may change on April 10. The House of Commons could come to life.
For that to happen, no party must have an overall majority. Most of this
year's polls suggest that that would be the outcome of an April 9 election.
Custom calls this a 'hung parliament' but, in truth, it would be a live
parliament. It is hung if you can only conceive of the imposition of the
will of one party. It is live if you regard coalition government as the
norm. It is hung if you are Anglo-Saxon; live if you are continental.
Yet I place no great hopes on this impending return of the living dead. Most
British politicians cannot think other than in terms of one-party rule. At a
symposium at the London School of Economics on Wednesday, Mr Vernon Bogdanor
reminded us that the four hung parliaments of this century - 1924, 1929-31,
1974, and 1976-79 - produced minority Labour administrations dependent on
Liberal support. Their performances ranged from the ineffective to the
disastrous. Labour used the Liberals as a convenience.
The long-term objective of the Liberal Democrats, putative partners for
1992, is the destruction of the Labour party so that they may replace it. Mr
Paddy Ashdown's troops will therefore be lucky if they are invited to
support Labour.
At Wednesday's symposium, which was organised by the tactical voting
campaign, Common Voice, Professor Ivor Crewe sketched six possible outcomes
to the next election. Half make the Tories the largest party, the other half
give the edge to Labour. In Outcome I the Tories have 315 seats, just 11
short of the 326 they need. They can try a deal with either the Liberal
Democrats (20 seats assumed in this model), or the Ulster Unionists (13
seats), or they can rule without any of them, on the assumption that the six
smaller parties will not have a common interest in uniting to overthrow the
Conservatives. In reality, a Tory deal with the Liberal Democrats, following
the loss of the Tory majority, would be too cynical even for politicians
desperate to cling to power, while the Unionists are unpredictable. So the
Tories might govern alone until they saw a chance to win a second election.
By Outcome III, the Conservatives are down to 303 seats. To thump their
chests atop I place no great hopes in the impending return of the living
dead
Big Ben they need the support of at least two other parties (Liberal
Democrats plus Ulster Unionists, or plus Scottish Nationalists, or plus
Welsh Nationalists). Forget it. Fractions of percentage points separate the
contestants in all of these scenarios. Calculations IV-VI result in a
similar variety of choices for a Labour party with the largest number of
seats. In every one save I and, just possibly, II (Tories 309), Mr Neil
Kinnock becomes prime minister.
Some proponents of constitutional reform place hope in that. Labour is
dangling the promise of a Scottish assembly, regional assemblies, and a
senate to replace the House of Lords. All would be elected on some form of
proportional representation. Labour campaigners for PR believe that the
party will be converted to electoral reform for the Commons at the party
conference in October. If so, the Liberal Democrats would by then differ
from Labour only in that they are not tied to the unions and, in
consequence, are more robust in their appreciation of market principles. A
Labour-Alliance coalition in 1983 or 1987 would have betrayed the principles
of both parties; Labour was at the time unilateralist, socialist, and
anti-Europe. It is now none of those things. Since Mr Kinnock's party has
moved nine-tenths Alliance-wards, it could claim that a coalition between
its MPs representing, say, 40 per cent of the vote and the Liberal
Democrats' representation of, say, 20 per cent would reflect current
majority opinion in Britain. Call it 50 per cent plus, since many of today's
potential Liberal Democrat voters would abstain or vote Conservative rather
than let Labour in.
Mr Ashdown's terms are well-known: coalition, a four-year pact, PR, and the
building of the fourth Trident submarine. Labour would not easily be tied
into such a deal if its sole purpose was to repeat the experience of 1974,
when Mr Harold Wilson used the Liberals to keep him going after the February
election until he could get an overall majority in October. You have to be a
childish wide-eyed optimist to believe that Mr Kinnock would want anything
else.
Yet there are some who believe that he and his colleagues can learn from
history. Past Lib-Lab pacts have ended in failure for Labour. The necessary
conditions for a successful future understanding are that Labour abandon its
dreams of becoming the natural majority party of government, while the
Liberal Democrats grasp the point that they cannot hope to destroy Labour.
If personal ambitions are a bar to this kind of accommodation, history
suggests that it may yet come about.
I first postulated such a 'grand alliance' in this space on July 2 1987.
Most of its building-blocks, which then seemed out of reach, are now in
place. The principal remaining requisite is a conversion of the likely
consenting parties to permanent multi-party government. It is more likely to
be met in a live parliament with Labour and the Liberal Democrats in
opposition than with Labour in power. For in government, Labour might not
need to change. Out once more, it would have to.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Budget '92: Dragons still to slay - Tory hopes hinge on next
week's Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next Tuesday is make or break day for Mr Norman Lamont. Rarely has so much
been riding on a parliamentary occasion as on the chancellor's second Budget
on March 10.
Barring an unexpected and surely self-destructive last-minute attack of the
dithers by Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Lamont's speech will
effectively launch the campaign for the general election that is expected on
April 9. The Budget itself will become part of the Conservative manifesto
and so compete for electoral support with rival budgets from Labour and the
Liberal Democrats. Besides salvaging the battered political fortunes of the
chancellor and his party, it must also offer a credible prospect of lifting
the UK out of the longest recession since the second world war.
Given the bleak economic background, Mr Lamont has fared moderately well
through a notably porous pre-Budget purdah. He and other Treasury ministers
have joined in the party rough-and-tumble while coyly ducking questions
relating to the Budget. Meanwhile, the pre-election campaign has allowed
speculation to run riot about what the chancellor might or might not do on
the big day, conveniently anaesthetising the reservations of financial
markets.
It would have been a brave soul who forecast a tax 'giveaway' of Pounds 2bn
when the chancellor began his Budget planning just two months ago. Now talk
of a fiscal boost of between Pounds 3bn and Pounds 4bn is commonplace, and
even considered cautious by some. After speculation that the Budget deficit
or Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) could soar from about Pounds
12bn this year to Pounds 30bn in 1992-93 - some 5 per cent of gross domestic
product - it is likely that anything between Pounds 24bn and Pounds 26bn
will leave the markets unfazed.
But while the chancellor's financial room for manoeuvre has grown, he
probably has less scope for action politically. The Labour party's charge
that he is planning to 'borrow to bribe' voters appears to have struck a
chord with the electorate and won back some of the ground lost by Labour to
the Conservatives in January when Mr Lamont launched an attack on Labour's
plans to tax higher income earners. It can have been no comfort to the
chancellor and his advisers that a Thatcherite rump, centred on Mr Cecil
Parkinson, the former Tory party chairman, and the monetarist economists Sir
Alan Walters and Professor Patrick Minford, has also castigated the idea of
borrowing more to finance tax cuts.
So Mr Lamont will have a lot of dragons to slay when he delivers his speech.
His cabinet colleagues will be expecting what one minister this week called
a 'Budget for victory'. The chancellor's appeal to the voters must manage to
draw the sting of Labour's own shadow budget, which is due for publication
the following week, and quell the anxieties of Thatcherites and Tory
monetarists. It must also satisfy financial markets, and offer them a
convincing intellectual justification for next year's sharply increased PSBR
and high borrowing in later years, if, as expected, the government's
previous goal of balancing the Budget over the economic cycle no longer is
sustainable.
Britain's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism and the
convergence rules attached to the Maastricht Treaty on Economic and Monetary
Union have greatly eased Mr Lamont's task in making his financial judgment
for the Budget.
The constraints imposed on interest rate reductions by the ERM and Germany's
tight counter-inflationary monetary policy have been matched by a growing
tolerance of fiscal activism in financial markets. As a result, PSBR
projections that would have shocked the City when sterling was a
free-floating currency have left the market for government gilt-edged
securities largely unruffled and protected the pound from speculative
assault through the pre-Budget period.
However, the chancellor will be aware that markets are fickle. Although he
may be able to drop or fudge the government's balanced budget commitment,
the City will be anxious that he does not erode the government's revenue
base in future years. Drawing the line between profligacy and prudence will
still require careful judgment.
In his assessment of the economy, he must decide whether his Budget can
continue to be based on expectations of economic recovery - albeit delayed -
or whether Britain is facing something more serious than a cyclical
recession, such as a depression triggered by the accumulation of debt in the
1980s. He knows that the Budget will come too late to have any direct effect
on the economy by election day. But his speech must offer a plausible path
out of the recession.
Although Mr Lamont was mistaken a year ago in believing that the economy
would pick up from mid-1991, there is nothing to suggest he has revised his
belief that the ingredients of recovery are in place. Indeed, lower bank
base rates and a sharp 8.6 per cent jump in general government expenditure
planned for 1992-93 mean that the government's policy stance has eased
substantially since Mr Lamont's first Budget. Recovery now lies largely in
the hands of the consumer, who, if in work, is benefiting from low
inflation, modest real wage increases and falling mortgage rates.
Of more immediate importance will be the Budget's political judgment. That
will determine whether Mr Lamont will enjoy a niche in history and an
honourable place in the Conservative pantheon or be blamed for defeat at the
polls.
With the Budget set to become part of the Conservative election manifesto,
he must choose whether to emphasise the differences between Conservative and
Labour economic policies or appeal to as broad a cross-section of voters as
possible.
The mood of the electorate is a problem. Neither the Tory campaign against
Labour's tax plans nor the flood of news stories pointing to income tax cuts
in the Budget appear to have caused any great enthusiasm for tax give-aways.
A Mori poll in last week's Sunday Times found that 69 per cent of the
electorate would prefer Mr Lamont to spend more on public services against
only 26 per cent who wanted tax cuts. When asked which tax cuts people would
prefer, an overwhelming 72 per cent favoured what would be a humiliating
reversal of last year's increase in VAT to 17.5 per cent from 15 per cent.
Nearly 60 per cent backed a big increase in tax-free allowances rather than
a cut in the basic rate of income tax from 25 per cent.
On the other hand, the Conservatives suffered no electoral damage from
lowering the burden of income tax in their two previous pre-election Budgets
in 1983 and 1987. The obvious conclusion is that electors are more
altruistic when talking to opinion pollsters than when filling in their
ballot papers.
Taken together, the financial, economic and political background to the
Budget points to a balanced package of tax cuts rather than a radical Budget
that could offend as much as it might please. Although Mr Lamont is a more
unpredictable politician than his downbeat public image might suggest, the
record of his chancellorship and his own instincts and convictions will tell
against any package that is overtly risky.
These factors and fears of eroding the tax base would count against anything
as radical as two pence off the basic income tax rate or permanent increases
in depreciation allowances to boost investment.
The motor industry has some claim on the chancellor's generosity because
last year's Budget extended employers' national insurance contributions to
company cars with effect from July this year, in a move that will boost
government revenues by Pounds 550m in 1992-93. But one penny in the pound
off the basic rate of income tax, some increase in income tax allowances by
more than the statutory 4.5 per cent indexation, and temporary help for
businesses, most probably through easing the burden of the uniform business
rate, look the most likely give-aways, offset in part through higher excise
duties on alcohol and tobacco.
In this health-conscious age, the government can probably escape serious
electoral damage from a Budget day assault on beer and tobacco. And Mr
Lamont is sure to have other fiscal lollipops up his sleeve. One strongly
tipped possibility is a national lottery. Another may be help for Britain's
hard-pressed film industry, which, if nothing else, would give the
chancellor some flattering photo-calls between Budget and election days.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Arts: David Byrne - Ronnie Scott's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A solo appearance before an invited audience armed only with acoustic guitar
and a clutch of backing tracks brought David Byrne to London for the first
time since Talking Heads were officially consigned to the annals of rock.
His early-evening session at Ronnie Scott's on Tuesday was convened
nominally to display the wares on his new solo album Uh-Oh (Sire), yet
seemed just as much a declaration of Byrne's independence now as a performer
as well as a song writer. There was the statutory scattering of new tracks,
but also fond backward glances to Talking Heads and a clutch of cover
versions.
It was an absorbing, delightfully low-key affair. There is nothing contrived
about Byrne's platform manner these days; the big suits and the stylised
gestures of the Heads' concerts really have gone for ever. The presentation
between the songs was minimal and almost apologetic, though in performance
the vocal role-playing and vehement attack are still summoned at will.
The new material harks back to the sounds and melodic shapes of late Talking
Heads - to the multilayerings of Naked especially - though the synthesisers
are now mixed with the brassy salsa rhythms of Byrne's Brazilian
expeditions. The best of the songs seem as strong as anything he's written
for a decade, and he has retained the knack of capping a routine one with a
naggingly insidious chorus. Pared down for the concert, one could relish the
words more vividly than on the album - in the ironic paean to transsexualism
'Now I'm your Mom', the distinctly menacing 'Walk in the Dark', or the most
Heads-like of all, 'Tiny Town'. Byrne, one suspects, is a better guitarist
than he or anyone gives him credit for, and one rarely missed the intricate
arrangements that cocoon the recorded versions.
Nostalgia aside, the Talking Heads numbers were the least successful part of
the show, save for a robust 'Road to Nowhere'; perhaps Byrne has yet to
rekindle his enthusiasm for all that history. The covers, though, were a
delightful surprise - numbers borrowed from Wire and the Texas Tornados
(their discomfitingly witty 'Who were you thinkin' of?') and, of all people,
Neil Young: a really sharp version of 'Rocking in the Free World' wound
things up. It certainly provided food for thought. Perhaps Young will now
return the compliment and give his version of 'Psycho Killer', which really
would keep us all awake at night.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Arts: As You Desire Me - New End Theatre, Hampstead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is a genuine rarity that gave me a great deal of pleasure: an almost
totally forgotten play by Pirandello that has the master's touch and at
times fairly crackles with suspense about what is real and what is not.
As You Desire Me was written in 1930 and last performed in London in 1948.
It is set in a mixture of Berlin and northern Italy, 1928, when the scars of
the first world war were still deep and it was still too early to predict
with certainty that the Weimar Republic contained the seeds of the second,
though I must say that in his scenes of German decadence Pirandello came
remarkably close to seeing the way the country was going.
Cia or the 'unknown woman', as she is normally referred to, is a dancer in a
sleazy German cabaret. She is the mistress of a German writer, whose crazed
daughter is as infatuated with Cia as he is. She has forgotten her past
because of the devastation of the war. Then an Italian friend of her husband
turns up, asking her to go home. The German lover shoots himself, but not
fatally. The rest of the play moves to the Italian family villa in Udine.
I shall not go further into the plot because I do not want to give away the
suspense. Suffice it to say that it revolves around whether Cia really is
the missing wife. On one level, of course she is, but the point is that she
has changed and is not the same person she was 10 years before when dragged
away by the troops and officers at the end of the war. Here we are on
familiar Pirandello territory: what is real and what is an illusion? It may
not be the best the piece he wrote, but it is the real thing: no imitator
could have done it.
Some of the vignettes are superb: the performance of the crazed daughter
(played by Janet Steel), for example. So are some of the physical details: a
mark on Cia's leg that may or may not have been deliberately removed. The
suspense is intellectual: note the sudden chill when the German lover,
arriving in Italy, seems to have proved through female psychology that Cia
is not Cia after all.
The production in the tiny New End Theatre seemed to me slightly
under-rehearsed. It began nearly 20 minutes late, had two intervals instead
of the one that was billed, and there was some fluffing of lines. The acting
is uneven, sometimes even by the same character. Ruth Kettlewell as the old
aunt, for instance, frequently looks and speaks as if she was born to play
Miss Marple; at other times she is curiously wooden. The women, on the
whole, are better than the men.
Cia is played by Sandra Fox. This is a magnificent part, including the
cabaret dancing, and with a little more rehearsal it should be a magnificent
performance. Even now it is thoroughly gripping. The direction is by Derek
Wax and one can only salute the enterprise in unearthing the play and
producing a new translation by Kate Nelson. It runs at Hampstead until March
29 and it deserves more.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Technology: Blinded by the light - Michiyo Nakamoto explains
why recordable compact discs are proving so elusive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crisp, clear digital sound of compact discs, those shiny, silvery plates
that bounce little rainbows off their surface, has fundamentally changed the
way we listen to music.
The problem for audio buffs, however, is that having become used to the
superior quality of digital recordings, they still have to make do with
dull-sounding conventional analogue tapes if they want to make recordings at
home.
It is not that the manufacturers have been blind to the potential for this
market. Audio tapes that can be used to record music at home, digitally, are
already on offer.
Sony's digital audio tape has been on the market since 1986 and Philips is
launching its digital cassette player this autumn. The quality of sound
which digital tapes offer is just as good as that of CDs.
But digital tapes are still tapes, with the attendant problems that anyone
who has played their favourite tune over and over again is familiar with. So
the search has been on for recordable CDs, which would provide random access
to any music track.
The CDs that are currently available are of the 'read only' type. They are
pre-recorded digitally and cannot be recorded on once they have left the
factory.
To record on a disc, laser technology uses heat to make marks of light and
dark. To read what is recorded on a disc, the laser beam goes over the disc
and picks up the light and dark marks on it as digital signals, which it
then converts into sound signals.
Recordable CDs would have to be made in a form that would allow the laser
beam in a CD player to make marks on the disc and then read back what was
written.
There are two technical problems faced by manufacturers making recordable
CDs.
The laser in the compact disc player picks up certain data from the disc,
such as the number of tracks and the length of each, before it will play the
disc. This is known as the table of contents.
But since recordable CDs, which are blank, do not have a table of contents,
the laser cannot pick up the information. Any existing CD player would
refuse to play such a disc. This is a problem for Philips and Sony since
they are committed to allowing any new CDs to be used on existing players.
The other technical obstacle has been that the industry standard for CDs
requires them to have 70 per cent reflectivity (the disc has to reflect 70
per cent of the light that hits it) after they have been recorded on.
In order for a laser beam to write on the CD, however, the surface needs to
be dark enough to absorb the heat from the laser beam. The reflectivity
needs to be 15 to 20 per cent.
To put a recordable CD on the market, manufacturers have had to come up with
a material that has a low enough reflectivity to be recorded on but that
will still end up as a shiny disc with a reflectivity of 70 per cent so that
it can be played back.
The first of these two problems has been overcome by including a function in
recordable CD players that will put a table of contents on the disc after it
has been recorded. Thus any CD that has been recorded on can then be played
on a conventional player.
The problem of reflectivity has been solved by Taiyo Yuden, a Japanese
electronics company. Taiyo put a chemical layer just above the layer of
metal coating in the CD on which the laser beam would make its marks and off
which it would read them. The chemical layer is easily activated by heat.
When the laser beam hits this layer it reacts with the heat and works on the
underlying metal coating to make the necessary marks.
Taiyo's recordable CDs have been on the market for professional use and for
use in computers at a cost of about Y4,400 (Pounds 20). The disc has a life
expectancy of 100 years, says Taiyo.
However, the company has no immediate plans to manufacture recordable CDs
for the consumer market, largely due to the high price of recordable players
which still sell at about Y1m.
It is also unlikely that the price of the recordable discs will fall in the
foreseeable future on a par with pre-recorded CDs. The high price is mostly
due to the complex manufacturing process and mass production may not
automatically bring the price down.
Plasmon, a Cambridge-based manufacturer of optical discs, and Ciba-Geigy,
the Swiss chemical company, have agreed a joint development project to
produce a second type of recordable CD which would use what they claim is a
more stable chemical than that used by Taiyo. Plasmon is hoping to bring the
price down to Pounds 5 within five years.
Meanwhile, others are working on rewritable CDs.
Sony has opted to develop magneto optics, a technology that uses light, heat
and magnetism, for its minidisc system of small recordable CDs.
Matsushita, on the other hand, has opted for the 'phase change' approach
based on laser technology, which it already employs in recordable and
rewritable systems for computers.

FT  06 MAR 92 / The Property Market: Warsaw: Paris prices, Albanian
standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International companies seeking office space in Warsaw beware. The Polish
capital's commercial property market has been characterised as one with
Paris prices, Albanian standards and Tokyo's lack of space.
Indeed, in a league table of European centres with the highest offices
rents, both Warsaw and Czechoslovakia's capital Prague surprisingly figure
in the top five.
Prime rents in both cities are running at between Pounds 35 to Pounds 40 a
sq ft - easily a match for Paris or a very depressed City of London property
market.
The reason for these unexpectedly high rents is that there are too few
buildings being chased by too many tenants. Western companies wanting to
open representative offices in Warsaw, to take advantage of the
liberalisation of the Polish economy, have struggled to find appropriate
accommodation.
There are currently only two office schemes under construction in Warsaw's
city centre. One is an 800,000 sq ft office complex being developed by Golub
Epstein Partnership of the US, National Bank of Poland and the European Bank
of Reconstruction and Development. The project will cost Dollars 120m.
The land for the project was provided by National Bank of Poland which will
eventually take a third of the space. EBRD has provided Dollars 65.6m of
loan finance and Dollars 3m of equity, representing 12 per cent of the total
equity of the joint venture. The second large development is a 170,000 sq ft
office and shop complex by Ibau, an Austrian developer.
Presently, there are no other buildings available which would provide a
stand-alone corporate headquarters. Coca Cola, one of many western companies
which have opened offices in Warsaw, is looking for a site to develop its
own building.
The drinks company currently occupies a floor in the Palace of Culture and
Science, a massive Stalinesque monument which is as impressive outside as it
is tawdry inside. Lifts are slow and old, the large corridors are drab and
the viewing platform at the top, providing one of the best views of Warsaw,
is spattered with graffiti.
From this vantage point it is possible to identify several large sites where
developments are planned by international investors but which have still to
get under way. These include a 150,000 sq metre hotel, office and retail
centre planned by CA Real Estate of Sweden.
Gleeds, a firm of British chartered surveyors which has established offices
in Warsaw (and in Prague), says German Austrian, US, Swedish and French
companies have been among the most active foreign contractors and developers
in the local market. The British, he says, have been less aggressive. One
exception is Trusthouse Forte, the UK hotel group, which is building a
five-star 208-room luxury hotel in Warsaw.
Gleeds, which operates out of offices in the Palace of Culture and Science
(it pays rent monthly in a mix of D-Marks and US dollars), says the slow
rate of development is disappointing though understandable.
One reason is that Polish companies and individuals do not have the money to
invest in building while international developers are hesitant to invest
given Poland's unstable political and economic environment.
Yet for those who are prepared to take the plunge the potential rewards  -
based on present level of rents - are good. Construction costs, too, should
be low so long as local companies can overcome a tradition of inefficiency
and delay.
Poland with a population of almost 40m is one of Europe's biggest countries.
Excluding the former Soviet republics, only Italy, Germany, the UK and
France have larger populations. Most international companies will want to
have some kind of representative office to serve such a large market.
Yet developers which are prepared to take the risk can face long delays and
inefficiency as they try to find their way through a minefield of politics
and bureaucracy in a community which has little experience of how to manage
the planning, design, finances and physical construction of a large private
sector development.
Mr Phil Hudson, partner of East 8, the UK property consultants which advised
the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development on its Warsaw
investment, said: 'The biggest problem is finding the right person to make a
decision. Those with authority often prevaricate. People who do not have
authority are prepared to promise you the earth. Even when you think a
decision has been made, it can be changed.'
Western financial and engineering consultants operating in Warsaw say petty
corruption is endemic, feeding off the confusion that greets Poles and
international developers seeking to win approval for schemes.
Identifying potential sites is not a problem. Old Warsaw was almost
completely destroyed during the second world war. The rebuilt city contains
large area of open space (cynics say it was to make it easier for the secret
police to see what the local population was up to). These large open areas
should provide opportunities for a new wave of development so long as
finance and planning can be arranged.
Determining ownership of potential sites is another headache. Families have
the right to reclaim land and buildings acquired by the former communist
regime. But finding out the identity of owners can be difficult.
Gleeds tells of a young expatriate architect of Polish descent who claimed
an estate in north Warsaw, previously owned by his grandfather. The young
man had lost his father's birth certificate proving his relationship to the
grandfather. The claim was eventually agreed but only after long delays and
much research.
Mr Roman Dziekonski, vice-president of the city authority, is trying to
improve planning procedures. He wants to create a development zone within
Warsaw similar to that in London's Docklands. This would offer planning and
fiscal incentives and would also attempt to short-circuit red tape.
Mr Dziekonski is regarded by international developers and consultants as one
of the few bright lights in the central and local government firmament,
following the resignation last month of Poland's finance minister, Mr Karol
Lutkowski.
Slow decision-making, political uncertainty and a series of highly
publicised banking scandals have delayed several potential foreign
investments. Up to 40 possible foreign purchases are in the pipeline in
sectors such as car production, pulp and paper, cement and brewing.
Recent investors include Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss/Swedish electrical
group, which already employs more than 10,000 people in Poland and has taken
a 10 per cent stake in the recently privatised Elektrim trading company.
Unilever, the UK/Dutch consumer goods group, and Benckiser and Henkel, two
German detergents manufacturers, have also separately acquired controlling
interests in Polish companies.
Companies looking for a presence in Poland will certainly want to buy or
rent quality office space. Those looking for accommodation in Warsaw include
a leading French manufacturer and a top British financial institution. Those
like SmithKline Beecham, the British pharmaceuticals group, which already
have small offices in Warsaw, are looking for larger accommodation.
In any event, demand from potential occupiers is likely to stay firm; at the
same time the risks for developers will remain high.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Management: Sum total adds up to more than figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may seem a naive question to ask in a newspaper such as this, but should
finance necessarily be the common language of a company? You would certainly
think so from the horrified reaction of some people last week to a study
which demonstrated the ignorance of many non-financial managers in Britain
about a series of basic tools and concepts: such fundamentals as
depreciation, discounted cash flow and even the difference between a
balance-sheet and a profit and loss account.
Paradoxically, the conclusion that finance is all-important has probably
been drawn by most people from a sustained correspondence in the FT over the
past month about Akio Morita's declaration that accountants should not run
manufacturing companies in Britain - or, presumably, anywhere else.
The bombastic chairman of Sony complained that too much of British industry
is in the hands of accountants who do not understand the engineering that
goes into their own products. Quite so.
Predictably, the resulting correspondence has ranged the accountants against
Britain's downtrodden engineers. Between these two extremes, the seemingly
level-headed centre of the debate was epitomised by a managing director who
wrote last week that 'the only real common ground between disciplines in any
business, whether in engineering or not, is finance'.
On the face of it, his argument may indeed appear sensible. But I beg to
differ with it.
Finance need not be the common language of a company - certainly not the
only one. Have we struggled in vain through our various business experiences
of the past decade, learning nothing from 'In Search of Excellence', Total
Quality Management, and various versions of the maxim 'put the customer
first'?
If 'Excellence', the best-selling business book of the 1980s, taught us
anything other than that good management is a lot more complicated - and
short-lived - than many people thought, it is this: that successful
companies have a powerful set of beliefs (or 'values') that are shared
across the organisation, from top to bottom and side to side.
Few, if any, of these beliefs are financial: they are certainly not
expressed in financial terms.
Then there is TQM. Many aspects of it are expressed in financial terms, but
by no means all of them are. It also involves various non-financial
measures: of quality performance, of customer satisfaction, and so on.
And what about Customer First (or 'Close to the Customer', if you prefer
that version of the jargon)?
For a value such as this really to permeate a company, what is needed is not
so much financial literacy as an understanding both of consumer psychology
and of basic marketing concepts such as positioning and segmentation.
Yet many people in such companies - including accountants and even some
sales executives - are woefully ignorant of the real meaning of such
terminology.
Is this any more serious than the ignorance of financial concepts shown by
the respondents to last week's study?
My answer would be no, they are both equally serious: that marketing should
be just as much the common ground between disciplines as is finance.
So, too, in a manufacturing company, should be engineering, electronics,
chemicals or whatever. Can anyone imagine, say, a Sony or Apple manager who
does not understand electronics - regardless of his or her background?
Which brings us to the question of whether specialists of one sort can be
expected to learn another's language, and embrace it as a real part of their
thinking processes.
That engineers can, given the right training, live and breathe finance - and
marketing - is patently obvious from the accomplishments of so many of them
at and near the top of successful companies in Japan, Germany, Sweden and
also the United States.
The same almost goes for marketing people: once trained, they are certainly
adept at thinking finance, though they find engineering a bit harder.
But accountants? With notable exceptions, there is only limited evidence to
suggest that the fraternity can really learn to 'breathe' either marketing
or engineering.
In part, this is because accountancy is essentially a control discipline,
whereas marketing and engineering are at least partly creative - or should
be.
Arch controllers who have plumped at an early age for the safe (well,
safe-ish) waters of accountancy find it harder to think creatively - in the
proper sense of the word - than creative people find it to master the skills
of control.
All of which leaves us with the conclusion that finance is important, but
not all-important. Just like marketing and engineering, in fact.
Hence, the idea, advocated in the current issue of the Harvard Business
Review, of a 'balanced score-card' of measures, which complement a financial
perspective with ones on customer satisfaction, internal company processes,
and the organisation's innovation and learning activities.
The only totally common ground between disciplines in business is not
finance, but people.
But that does not mean that everyone in a company should understand the
often arcane language of personnel any more than that those unfortunate
personnel managers in last week's survey - a quarter of the sample - should
lie awake worrying about the proper definition of DCF.

FT  06 MAR 92 / BA sets up regional business after union deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS is setting up a business to run its domestic regional
services called British Airways Regional. This follows agreement with BA's
unions to reduce annual staff costs on its regional network by Pounds 8.25m
from the beginning of next month.
BA said the cost-cutting package would improve profitability and safeguard
about 1,000 jobs in its domestic regional services based at Birmingham,
Manchester and Scotland.
The agreement comes after several months of negotiations. It does not
include BA's shuttle services between London Heathrow and Manchester,
Belfast, Glasgow and Edinburgh, as well as services between Heathrow,
Newcastle upon Tyne and Aberdeen and transatlantic services from Manchester
and Glasgow.
British Airways Regional will operate 23 BAe One-Eleven jet aircraft at
Birmingham and Manchester and 13 BAe ATP turboprops based in Scotland.
Mr Robert Ayling, BA's director of marketing and operations, said the launch
of British Airways Regional was a new phase in the company's short-haul
operations which marked a further 'significant step in BA's determination to
control costs'.
Up to 500 staff at the Swindon headquarters of Galileo, the international
travel booking network owned by a consortium of European airlines, could
lose their jobs after the company's merger with its US equivalent Apollo.
Mr Pieter Bouw, president of Galileo and chairman of KLM, the Dutch airline,
said yesterday that most of the cost savings after the merger would be
through job losses. He said that most of these would be in data processing
at Swindon.
Galileo said that 500 of the 800 staff at Swindon were 'technical'. The
remainder are in marketing.
The technical headquarters of the combined operation, which supplies
on-screen travel booking to more than 25,000 travel agents around the world,
will be in Denver, Colorado.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Bank denies conspiring to stop DTI investigation of NatWest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England yesterday denied allegations that it had conspired with
National Westminster Bank to prevent the Department of Trade and Industry
launching an inquiry into the clearer's role in Blue Arrow's Pounds 837m
rights issue of shares.
'The most that we did was to encourage the DTI to delay any inquiry until it
had the conclusions of NatWest's own investigation,' the Bank said
yesterday. It was responding to a suggestion made in this week's Economist
magazine that the Bank 'tried hard to persuade the DTI not to open a formal
inquiry'.
The Bank said: 'On April 13 (1988) the DTI told us it was considering
launching a formal investigation . . . They then agreed with us it was
sen-sible to await the outcome' of NatWest's own inquiry.
The Bank said evidence that the Economist gathered from the recent Blue
Arrow trial was capable of a different interpretation from the one put on it
by the magazine.
It confirmed that it gave advice to NatWest on how to present the
conclusions of the bank's investigation into the Blue Arrow share issue. The
investigation was supposed to uncover why NatWest failed to comply with
Companies Act requirements that it should disclose its huge exposure to Blue
Arrow shares, which it acquired when the rights issue flopped in September
1987.
The Bank said its advice was not that NatWest should absolve itself of
blame. It said it advised NatWest that the report should say there might
have been a deliberate attempt to circumvent the act.
An earlier draft of the internal report, according to the Bank, had
concluded that NatWest had merely made an 'honest mistake' in not disclosing
the exposure. 'We wanted the report to leave open the question' of whether
the non-disclosure was deliberate or accidental, the Bank said.
Separately, NatWest yesterday refused to make any comment in response to the
Economist's detailed analysis of the role played by its chief executive, Mr
Tom Frost, in the months before the DTI launched its formal inquiry in
December 1988 and during the DTI inquiry.
'There is still the possibility of a second Blue Arrow trial', the bank
said. 'Our lawyers tell us it would be inappropriate to comment'.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major accused as MPs split over
BCCI - Treasury Committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR is accused of ignoring warning signs about fraud at the
collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International in a series of Labour
additions to a Commons' report to be published next week.
Labour MPs on the Treasury committee, who failed to get the amendments
included in the main report, are expected to split publicly with
Conservative members when it is published on Wednesday.
They are concerned that Mr Major, who was chancellor when evidence of
deceitful accounting at BCCI emerged, should not escape some responsibility
for the affair.
The amendments, which almost amount to a 'minority report', were tabled by
Mr Brian Sedgemore, Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch.
He has received support - although with significant qualifications - from
his Labour colleagues Ms Diane Abbott (Hackney North and Stoke Newington),
Mr John Garrett (Norwich South) and Mr Giles Radice (Durham North).
They failed, however, to out-vote the Conservatives and one Liberal Democrat
on the Tory-dominated committee.
The main report is highly critical of the Bank of England for delaying
action against BCCI. Mr Sedgemore's amendments go on to implicate Mr Major,
in the belief that the Bank of England should not be used as simply a
'fall-guy' for Treasury ministers.
The Bank is responsible for banking regulation, but the Treasury has a broad
role in overseeing its actions.
Mr Sedgemore has compiled a diary of 33 warning signs between 1985 and
BCCI's closure in July last year, which he says were available to the Bank
of England. Of these, 19 occured during the period when Mr Major was
chancellor, he says.
The colourful language of the amendments clashes with the moderate style of
Mr Terence Higgins, Tory chairman of the committee, in the main report. The
Labour MPs believe many of Mr Sedgemore's points are valid.
The Bank of England received a report on BCCI from accountants Price
Waterhouse in April 1990 which said some accounting transactions at the bank
had been false or deceitful. The report was followed by a shake-up at BCCI
and a restructuring of its balance sheet.
According to evidence given by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the
Bank of England, Mr Major was told about the restructuring but not the
contents of the April 1990 report. Only after a Price Waterhouse report to
the Bank in June last year was there sufficient evidence of fraud at BCCI to
justify its closure.

'adventure'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PEOPLE of Britain were offered an 'adventure' yesterday, as Mr Neil
Kinnock launched a magazine called Your Land, My Land, featuring
contributions from Labour-supporting celebrities, Alison Smith writes.
Labour's leader is pictured with Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, Dr Penelope Leach,
baby-care writer, businessman Mr Philip Hughes, novelist Mr Ken Follett,
scientist Sir Martin Rees and Ms Douanne Alexander-Moore, a businesswoman.
Mr Kinnock said he wanted Britain to 'greet the year 2000 as a fair and free
society, a strong and productive economy and a confident and creative
people'.
Mr John Major had no vision for Britain, he continued, and his rhetoric
about creating a 'classless society' did not match his record.
The 10,000 print run of the glossy magazine will be distributed to
constituencies across the country, and individual articles are also being
offered to trade and professional publications. The contributors will be on
parade at Labour rallies during the campaign.
Among the celebrities appearing yesterday, Mr Follett said his vision was of
a Britain 'fizzing and popping with fun', while Sir Anthony Scrivener QC, a
former chairman of the Bar Council, wrote that his vision included a Bill of
Rights - something that is not currently Labour party policy.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: An olive branch with dangerous
roots - Tim Coone and Ralph Atkins examine Sinn Fein's latest search for
political acceptance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR British and Irish ministers meet in Dublin today amid hopes of a new
panorama opening on Northern Ireland.
After a seven-month lapse the four main political parties in Ulster are due
to hold a symbolic first meeting of 'round-table' talks on the province's
future on Monday. Church leaders have met paramilitary chiefs in an apparent
effort to broker a ceasefire.
These are small changes, but enough to refocus attention on the role of Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the IRA, which has not been invited to the
talks.
The IRA is threatening to disrupt the British general election with a
bombing campaign. Ironically, its efforts coincide with a diplomatic
offensive by Sinn Fein to win a place at the negotiating table.
At their recent congress in Dublin the 'Shinners' launched their first key
strategy document for years, Towards a Lasting Peace, calling it an 'olive
branch' to Ulster Unionists and the British and Irish governments.
Both governments, the main political parties in both countries and Catholic
and Protestant churches have condemned Sinn Fein for its association with
the IRA, and its stance on armed struggle, which Mr Gerry Adams, party
president and MP for West Belfast, spelt out again at the congress.
Mr Adams said: 'Irish people have the right to use armed struggle in the
context of seeking Irish independence and in conditions of British
occupation of the Six Counties. Whether Irish people wish to exercise that
right is a matter for them.'
Sinn Fein has been firmly told that it will not be accepted at the
negotiating table until it changes this equivocal stance. Peace overtures
from Mr Adams are viewed with profound scepticism, if not anger. A Labour
government in the UK would be equally antagonistic.
Sinn Fein maintains that it has no formal links to the IRA, although the
overlap is undeniable. It has social welfare programmes for IRA prisoners
and many members have been interned or convicted for paramilitary
activities.
The extent to which the party's political leaders influence the military
commanders of the IRA is open to question. Mr Adams says Sinn Fein and the
IRA make their decisions independently.
He and others in the party sometimes appear uneasy about civilian
casualties.
In an overt criticism of IRA tactics he told the congress: 'I repeat my firm
conviction that attacks on Protestants are wrong for exactly the same reason
that attacks on Catholics are wrong.' It was the loudest applause he
received throughout his speech.
The 'olive branch' Sinn Fein is offering is for the British and Irish
governments to make 'the ending of partition their policy (goal)' and that
this be carried out 'in consultation and co-operation with' the Ulster
Unionists.
Mr Adams did not rule out the possibility of a halt to the IRA's military
campaign as a means of bringing Sinn Fein into the talks. 'At some point
before, during or after this process, demilitarisation has to play a role,'
he said.
He believes the British government's strategy is not to involve Sinn Fein in
talks 'as it wants to defeat the Republicans'. But he said the British
government had talked to Republicans in the past.
British ministers regard hinting at talks with Sinn Fein as dangerous - it
would inflame Ulster's fiercely defensive Unionist community, ending for
some time any chance of progress in 'round table' talks.
It would also undermine the logic of the sophisticated and expensive
military operation against the IRA.
The British government argues that when new, workable forms of government
for the province are found, Sinn Fein's most powerful argument - that
Northern Ireland can never work in its current format - will have been lost.
So far, ministers have not succeeded in that aim.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Naval chief backs fourth Trident
sub - Defence Committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SENIOR naval officer responsible for Britain's strategic nuclear
deterrent programme yesterday gave firm support to the principle of building
a fourth submarine for the Trident submarine fleet.
Rear Admiral Ian Pirnie, chief of the Ministry of Defence's Strategic
Systems Executive, told the Commons defence committee that remarks he made a
year ago were misinterpreted. He said his advice to ministers had always
been that four submarines were needed.
He made his remarks as the first Trident submarine, HMS Vanguard, was being
lowered into the water at Barrow-in-Furness.
He said it was possible to show 'on paper' that three submarines could be
sufficient to keep one on patrol at all times. But that would allow for 'no
contingency at all or insurance against any form of material defect, refit
delays, or anything else.'
Cancellation of the fourth submarine would save about Pounds 400m or 4 per
cent of the total cost of the fleet. 'For that 4 per cent we increase our
submarine availability by 50 per cent,' he said.
MoD officials would not say how soon the contract for a fourth vessel might
be signed. They told the committee the first submarine would enter service
on schedule in late 1994 or early 1995.

News in Brief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday said that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, had
been forced into a humiliating climbdown to salvage the schools bill on
which the government was defeated by peers earlier this week, Alison Smith
writes.
Opposition party managers said that they had agreed to take the remaining
stages of the legislation next week only on the basis that the government
would not reverse the defeats.
Without opposition agreement, the government would not have been able to
secure the legislation if there is an election on 9 April, and the move was
seen as a further sign that the government was clearing the decks for an
election next month.
Peers insisted that the chief inspector of schools, rather than individual
governing bodies, would be able to choose private sector inspection teams,
and that local authorities should still have an automatic right of
inspection.
*****
TAXATION: The Conservatives last night accused Labour of retreating on its
pledge not to increase value added tax.
Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's environment spokesman, said the party was
'committed to measures such as varying the rates of VAT so that
environmentally benign goods face reduced rates of tax, while
environmentally damaging goods carry an increased mark-up'.
Labour party officials said last night that Mr Gould's comments did not
imply VAT rates would rise - only that there may be an increased
differential between products.
*****
POLLING: The Liberal Democrats yesterday released opinion poll results
showing it 'neck and neck' with the Tories in ten constituencies they hope
to win.
Mr Chris Patten, Tory chairman, was a 'probable' loser in his Bath
constituency, Mr Des Wilson, the party's election campaign director, said.
The other constituencies polled by PS Opinion Research since Christmas were
Cheltenham, Colne Valley, Conwy, Edinburgh West, Falmouth &amp; Campbourne,
Hazel Grove, Littleborough &amp; Saddleworth, Portsmouth South and Richmond and
Barnes.

BRITAIN'S biggest holiday companies are producing misleading brochures two
years after the Association of British Travel Agents introduced a code of
practice on the subject, according to a study by Holiday Which? magazine,
Michael Skapinker writes.
Thomson, the UK's biggest tour operator, described Faliraki on Rhodes as a
former fishing village which had retained its atmosphere. Holiday Which?
said it was 'a sprawling, Costa-style resort'.
Enterprise, part of Owners Abroad, the second biggest holiday company, told
potential visitors to some apartments that shops, tavernas and nightspots
were within easy reach. In fact it was half a mile's walk to the nearest,
solitary bar.
Airtours, the third biggest operator, published a brochure with a picture of
a beach on the same page as a description of a hotel. Holiday Which? found
the beach was 12 miles from the hotel.
The magazine found brochures from other operators with photographs taken in
such a way as to hide unsightly features.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Unions attack 'Tory hijack' of women's issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIVIL SERVICE unions yesterday accused the government of 'hijacking' and
watering down proposals to improve the position of women civil servants in
order to push them through hurriedly as pre-election publicity.
The charge followed the launch yesterday by the government's ministerial
group on women's issues of a revised programme for equal opportunities
action for women in the Civil Service
Ms Judy McKnight, women's officer of the NUCPS Civil Service union, said the
programme for action was a 'watered down' version of what had been agreed
after the 1984 management-union review of the position of women civil
servants.
She said: 'Key points of good practice included in the 1984 programme were
cut out.' Full consultation by the government would not have guaranteed the
unions all their goals but would probably have led to a 'meeting of minds'
on some things.
The Cabinet Office said it had met unions in February and their 'most
helpful comments' had been noted. Many, including those on sexual
harassment, were in the programme.
The government had announced its intention to publish the programme last
October and was not rushing publication, the Cabinet Office said.
The FDA top civil servants union said it had called for challenging, precise
targets, department by department, for women in senior grades. The programme
refers to 'informed projections'.
The FDA said the Cabinet Office was sympathetic to the idea of targets for
women in middle to senior grades, and that proper consultation might have
achieved some progress.
The Council of Civil Service Unions, a grouping of Civil Service unions,
said: 'While of course we welcome any programme of action to achieve
equality of opportunity for women, the CCSU is very concerned at the
unseemly haste with which this document, which we have been involved in
negotiating, has been hijacked by the government, intent on pre-election
publicity stunts.'

MR ASIL NADIR, former chairman of Polly Peck International, accepted that
there had been a non-disclosure in the company accounts of donations to the
Conservative party, according to a statement from his lawyers Pannone March
Pearson.
Mr Nadir did not understand the reason for this and the donations were
lawful, the statement said.
Labour MPs are demanding that the Conservative party should repay the Pounds
440,000 it received from the collapsed Polly Peck empire.
Mr Nadir is due to go on trial in the High Court in March next year on 25
charges of theft and false accounting. His lawyers are worried that the
controversy over the payment could affect the conduct of the trial.
In the Commons Mr Dale Campbell-Savours (Lab Workington) called on Mr John
MacGregor, leader of the Commons, to ensure action was taken to hand the
money over to the receivers administering the companies concerned.
Mr MacGregor stressed that the Conservative party had received the money
'entirely legally and in good faith'.
He reinforced earlier comments by Mr John Major, the prime minister,that
during the last general election campaign the contribution which the Labour
party received from the Transport and General Workers' Union exceeded all
the donations made by companies for political activities.
Conservative backbenchers denied Labour charges that the Conservative party
was 'in receipt of stolen cash'.

FT  06 MAR 92 / School cuts alleged despite rising rolls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INNER LONDON councils are cutting education budgets this year even though
pupil numbers are rising rapidly, according to a report by Ernst &amp; Young,
the accountants, for the Labour-dominated Association of London Authorities.
The report, based on six Labour-controlled councils, revealed reductions in
real terms in all six education budgets. With a 12 per cent increase in
pupils remaining at school beyond 16, the ratio of secondary pupils to
teachers had increased by 7.5 per cent.
In most boroughs, cuts of up to 75 per cent in adult education and youth
services have been imposed to protect schools. Four of the six boroughs -
Camden, Haringey, Hounslow, Islington, Lewisham and Newham - have failed to
allocate books and equipment to match increased numbers.
The ALA blamed the cuts on the government's poll-tax capping rules. However,
the report says that in spite of cuts 'the integrity of borough education
services has been maintained'.
The Association of Metropolitan Authorities said the position was similar in
other inner-city authorities. It also alleged that the government's special
education grant of Pounds 56.5m - intended to finance the 7.8 per cent
teachers' pay settlement announced last month - had been divided unevenly,
which particularly hit West Midlands and Greater Manchester.
The AMA issued figures supporting its claim that the grant was distributed
on the basis of school expenditure generally - not according to the number
of teachers employed.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Baccalaureate urged instead of Scots exam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCOTTISH education system will have its biggest shake-up for decades if
the Scottish Office implements recommendations to scrap the Higher exam and
introduce a system that included a baccalaureate.
A report by a committee chaired by Professor John Howie of St Andrew's
University said yesterday a baccalaureate would provide greater depth and
breadth of study than the Higher. There would be a vocationally-oriented
'Scottish certificate' for the majority.
Unlike English pupils, who may study three A-levels in the sixth and seventh
years of secondary school, Scottish pupils take up to five or six Highers at
the end of their fifth year, often in a combination of arts and science
subjects.
Highers, as well as being an important aspect of Scottish differentiation
from England, have been praised because up to 70 per cent of Scottish
youngsters stay on at school after the age of 16, compared with about 35 per
cent in England.
Prof Howie said the breadth of Highers was illusory because many pupils
obtained only one or two. 'Even the more able students display less breadth
of attainment than their European counterparts,' he added. Highers presented
little chance of studying in depth and pupils often rushed through them in
little more than two terms.
Vocational education suffered from a lack of esteem, with academic education
and excessive flexibility leading to arbitrary subject choices. The Scottish
upper secondary system was 'seriously wanting in many respects', he said.
The baccalaureate, for which pupils would study for three years up to the
sixth year, would have arts and science 'lines' but the common core would
include English, modern languages, mathematics, science, social subjects,
arts and information technology.

<TEXT>
DEFENCE industry employees may have call-up clauses written into their
contracts if proposals from the Ministry of Defence are implemented.
The plan would also affect civilians working for the MoD.
The aim of the scheme, part of a set of proposals in a consultative document
on the future of Britain's reserve forces, is to enable the government to
call automatically on certain categories of reservists to take up non-combat
duties in support of the armed forces in the event of war.
More than 40 UK defence companies sent employees to Saudi Arabia and other
Gulf countries to support equipment used by UK forces in the campaign
against Iraq a year ago.
Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, said yesterday: 'This will be a tidier
way of people going out in support of our country.'
Proposals also include an 'ever-ready' force of specialist reservists who
would voluntarily accept a liability for early call-up in time of crisis. Mr
King said this would involve several thousand people, such as medical staff
and linguists.
Changes are also planned in the law covering the call-up of reservists and
protection of their civilian jobs while they are serving.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Companies face claims on leases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY COMPANIES will face rent bills for offices they abandoned long ago if
they assigned their leases to businesses which later failed, according to
Lambert Smith Hampton, the firm of chartered surveyors, Ian Hamilton Fazey
writes.
It says landlords can claw back rents and costs at current prices from
previous lessees, even though many years have elapsed since they assigned
the lease.
Mr Tom Marshall, who heads Lambert's Manchester offfice, said companies in
the south-east were in greater danger because of the surge in rents in the
latter half of the 1980s.
Mr Marshall cited a company which took a 25-year lease on 12,000 sq ft of
offices in central London in 1974 at Pounds 12.50 per sq ft. It assigned
this 10 years later to a profitable company which could afford a reviewed
rent of Pounds 40, which rose to Pounds 62.50 in 1989.
The assignee failed last year so the landlord sent its demand to the
original lessee, which was still liable. Lambert said the company could face
costs of nearly Pounds 4m.
It points out that a result of companies becoming aware of the problem could
be that balance sheets might look less healthy because contingent
liabilities would have to be declared and provided for.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Sales of new cars show further steep decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK NEW car sales in February were 12 per cent lower than in the same month a
year ago as the 2 1/2 -year recession in the industry was deepened further
by uncertainty about possible changes in car taxation in next week's Budget.
New car registrations in February fell to 109,414 from 124,342 a year
before, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reported.
Sales were the lowest for the month of February since 1976, and have plunged
by 42.4 per cent in the past three years from 189,850 in February 1989.
Sir Hal Miller, SMMT chief executive, said the continuing decline underlined
'how urgently a boost for new car sales is needed if jobs and production are
to be safe-guarded'.
The Retail Motor Industry Federation, which urged the government to act next
week to cut the 10 per cent rate of special car tax, warned that '28
consecutive months of falling sales have inevitably resulted in job losses
and business closures'.
Registrations of new cars in the first two months of the year were 263,096 -
8.6 per cent lower than a year ago.
Ford new car sales tumbled in February by 30.3 per cent to 21,732. The
company, which is under severe pressure after record financial losses last
year, held on to its market leadership by the narrowest margin. It sold only
149 cars more than Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors.
The Ford marque retained its lead only after staging an extraordinary spurt
in sales in the final days of February. It achieved 35.2 per cent of its
February sales in the final five days.
The company has insisted that it took no measures last month to 'buy market
share', but in the last five days it captured daily shares of 24.9 per cent,
24.1 per cent, 32.3 per cent, 36.4 per cent and 26.4 per cent. After the
first 20 days of the month it held only a 16.1 per cent market share and was
in third place behind both Vauxhall and Rover.
Ford said yesterday: 'We cannot understand why we had this sudden surge in
sales. It was not something that was inspired by the company.'
Vauxhall, which has enjoyed a sharp revival in its fortunes in recent years,
increased its share of UK new car sales in February to 19.7 per cent from
17.4 per cent a year ago, while Ford's share fell to 19.9 per cent from 25.1
per cent a year earlier.

Ford, as a group General Motors, which includes Saab and Lotus, led the UK

FT  06 MAR 92 / Zikes] It's that inventor again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HOLDSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR CLIVE SINCLAIR, the prolific inventor, yesterday launched an electric
bicycle which travels at a top speed of about 12mph, Ian Holdsworth writes.
The Zike was unveiled seven years after the spectacular flop of Sir Clive's
electric tricycle, the C5. The ill-fated C5 tarnished the reputation of the
man who dominated the UK pocket calculator market in the 1970s and virtually
created the home computer market in the 1980s.
'One thing we learnt from the C5 which we couldn't have predicted was that
people felt insecure because it was low down,' Sir Clive said. 'What we have
now is a true bicycle.' The Zike travels for up to an hour under its own
power or for longer with help from the pedals and can be recharged in an
hour.
Several companies made electrically-powered bicycles in the 1980s but these
were generally encumbered with heavy batteries and bulky motors. They
usually weighed about 75lbs.
The Zike is much lighter. It uses a nickel-cadmium battery and a motor based
on a new form of magnet. Both weigh about a third of their predecessors and
are concealed in the frame. Using aircraft-style alloys instead of steel,
the Zike weighs 24lbs.
It is assembled for Sinclair Research in Birmingham by Tudor Webasto, a
maker of car sunroofs, and will be sold in Britain from May for Pounds 499.
Sir Clive sees two main markets. 'One is for people who want to use it to go
to the shops or for local commuting and the other is for young people for
whom it might be their first powered vehicle.'
Since Sir Clive's company, Sinclair Research, sold its home-computer
interests to Mr Alan Sugar's Amstrad for Pounds 5m in April 1986, it has
acted only as a holding company for other Sinclair ventures.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Indicator dashes hopes for early recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FLICKER of hope for economic recovery in the UK was extinguished yesterday
when the longer leading indicator, which records turning points in economic
activity about 10 months in advance, fell 0.6 per cent in January.
In its Quarterly Bulletin last month the Bank of England pointed to an
upturn in the leading indicators as evidence that conditions which in the
past had accompanied recovery were in place.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that the decline in optimism
recorded by the Confederation of British Industry in recent months led to
January's fall of the longer leading index to 102.6 from 103.2 in December.
The index turned upwards in May 1990 and rose until October 1991.
The shorter leading index, indicating turning points about four months in
advance, also fell in January. The CSO said this was the result of less
positive responses to the CBI surveys of new orders and expected change in
stocks of raw materials.
There was slightly better news for the government in a survey showing that
an upturn in consumer spending was under way. But the report, by Business
Strategies (BSL), an economic and business consultancy, said the upturn was
likely to be sluggish with consumer confidence remaining fragile.
BSL estimated that the overall fall in consumer spending last year was 1.9
per cent, the sharpest reduction in spending since 1948.
Mr Peter Dixon, senior economist at BSL, said: 'Although consumer spending
is beginning to recover, the pace of recovery is being held back by rising
unemployment and continued weak house prices.'
The report said that the recovery was being led by the east Midlands and the
north of England.
Mr Dixon predicted that leisure and other services would recover first and
consumer durables would be slower.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Lime Street turns sour for Names: The plight of investors
introduced by the agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GEORGE Pakozdi chuckles about his most recent demand for Pounds 300,000
from Lloyd's of London. 'It might as well be Pounds 3m,' he says. 'I went
through a period when I couldn't laugh, but you can't cry all the time. They
can only shoot me once.'
Mr Pakozdi, a dentist living in Toronto, far from the ancient traditions of
the London-based insurance market, is a Name.
He is one of hundreds of people who were introduced to Lloyd's through Lime
Street Underwriting Agencies, a company which is now insolvent and whose
creditors will meet today to vote on winding it up.
The lessons of Lime Street - named after the address of Lloyd's itself  -
are not necessarily typical of how Lloyd's worked during the 1980s, but they
illustrate how badly things could go wrong.
From its headquarters in a restored house in Houndsditch, on the edge of the
City, Lime Street recruited about 450 Names with nearly Pounds 200m in
assets. It acted as a members' agency by enrolling them in syndicates -
groups of Names that underwrite insurance contracts.
Lime Street Names now constitute a significant proportion of applications to
the Lloyd's hardship committee, which is considering the cases of
individuals without the assets to pay their obligations.
Many were enrolled in syndicates such as Gooda Walker 290 and 387 and
Feltrim 540, which are among the syndicates with the largest losses. Lime
Street Names comprise more than 70 per cent of all those on the 387
syndicate for 1989.
The history of Lime Street begins in 1976, when Mr Robin Kingsley, a Name
and a broker, branched out on his own. He created two members' agencies,
Lime Street Underwriting Agencies and Kingsley Carritt Underwriting
Agencies, which later merged.
A relation said: 'Robin wanted more than anything to be a Name. Lloyd's was
a god, a religion, an obsession to him.'
One underwriting agent who always avoided doing business with Mr Kingsley
said: 'He looked very sleek, with a double-breasted suit and a tan. He drove
a Rolls-Royce from a very early age. I'm sure he had friends, but I never
liked him.'
He recalled an occasion when many syndicates were losing money in the 1960s.
Mr Kingsley had earned a profit from his own syndicates. 'Robin walked past
me, stopped, pulled out a cheque, showed me the amount and gloated.'
Mr Kingsley specialised in excess-of-loss (XoL) and London market excess
(LMX) syndicates, which write reinsurance business - taking on risk from
syndicates seeking cover against catastrophic events. Reinsuring syndicates
normally reinsure their own risk with other LMX syn-dicates.
The theory was that any catastrophe which caused big losses on XoL
syndicates would lead underwriters to push up premiums, allowing syndicates
to achieve high rates of profitability.
Mr Kingsley was a pioneer of personal stop-loss insurance, an equivalent of
reinsurance for individual Names. The 1973 Finance Act made premiums for
personal stop-loss tax deductible. Mr Kingsley ran a substantial recruitment
campaign to attract Names. Like his father, he was a keen tennis player and
a member of the All England Lawn Tennis Club at Wimbledon. He persuaded
players including Mark Cox and Buster Mottram to join.
He also found people whose financial position was more precarious, however.
One London antiques dealer who had known him as a regular customer for more
than 15 years said that when he bought his house - his only significant
asset - and while he was still committed to substantial school fees, Mr
Kingsley increased pressure on him to become a Name.
The dealer obtained a valuation on his house of Pounds 298,000, and then
went to a building society which provided the Pounds 100,000 guarantee
Lloyd's required. This Name joined in 1988, never made a profit and
estimates his losses to date are more than Pounds 400,000.
He said: 'When we asked about the effect of a big disaster, Kingsley would
say: 'This will only cost you a gin and tonic.' He did of course say we
could lose everything, but it was always played down.'
He says he did not read documents sent to him by Mr Kingsley once he had
joined. 'I know it sounds pretty stupid, but we didn't understand anything.
As far as we were concerned it was a respectable organisation, and we had
known him for so long.'
Until the regulations were changed to forbid the practice in the late 1980s,
Mr Kingsley offered Names commission if they found new recruits. Many
members of his own family also became Names.
In the early 1980s he began what Mr Pakozdi calls 'annual pilgrimages' to
the US and Canada. On his first trips he flew economy class. By last year he
was planning to go by Concorde - but the trip was cancelled when Lime Street
ran into financial difficulties.
In Toronto he recruited a dentist and paid him a small sum to arrange
regular meetings with prospective Names, including fellow dentists (like Mr
Pakozdi), doctors, accountants, lawyers and business people.
The dentist's savings were wiped out in losses from his syndicates and, at
70, he has had to come out of retirement and resume his practice.
Mr Pakozdi says Mr Kingsley's gatherings were 'very professionally done. He
paid for the bills. Well, I guess we really did in the end. The bill came a
year later. The food wasn't that good.'
Existing Names were also encouraged by Mr Kingsley to increase their
capacity - the amount of money they pledge to different syndicates. 'It was
not a question of whether you wanted to increase your capacity, but by how
much,' says Mr Pakozdi. 'He would say rates (premiums) are hardening
(increasing) - it's a fantastic time to take advantage - strike while the
iron is hot.'
Some Names were persuaded by the apparent ease of making their assets (often
their house) work twice for them at a time when they needed extra income. Mr
Kingsley offered expertise, a spread of syndicates, personal stop-loss
insurance and the fact that the syndicates were reinsured. He was also a
member of many of the syndicates himself.
For many Names there was the advantage of being able to write off losses
against tax. Some were comforted by the prestige and tradition of Lloyd's.
All were impressed by figures showing profits stretching back over seven
years made on typical syndicates.
Many Lime Street Names never saw profits. Most were caught unawares in 1990
when they discovered the enormous losses for 1988 and estimates for 1989.
The demands for money have started to exceeded the upper limit of
reimbursement allowed under their stop-loss policies.
Some could not afford the costs of resignation - Pounds 250 plus VAT per
syndicate and other bills to the corporation and members' agents - let alone
contemplate legal action.
Others continued to underwrite on the brink of bankruptcy, hoping that one
more year would bring recovery.
Mr Colin Francis, who made money as a landlord and lost it through Lloyd's,
said: 'It was a mixture of flattery and greed. I was turned into a docile
fool by the mystique of Lloyd's'
He says he is technically bankrupt, has had to rent out his Kensington house
and is living with friends in north London.
Names recruited by Mr Kingsley claimed they asked to be put on low-risk
syndicates and said they never understood the high risks of the syndicates
on which they were being placed. Some said instructions to be moved to less
risky syndicates were ignored.
But they have little written evidence to back their case. Mr Francis said:
'Everything with Mr Kingsley was done over a glass of wine or lunch.'
Mr Kingsley refused to comment on the detailed complaints made by his Names.
Earlier this week he said simply: 'People have totally different conceptions
of high risk when they lose money.'
The Names feel the regulation conducted by the Lloyd's Corporation has let
them down, and have written documenting their complaints against Mr Kingsley
and his companies. But Lloyd's will not even say whether an investigation is
under way.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Lloyd's may face more litigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK, RICHARD LAPPER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH LEGAL action could be taken within the Lloyd's of London insurance
market following a meeting today liquidating one of its most troubled
agencies.
A group of Names - individuals whose assets back underwriting in the market
 -will fight for representation on the creditors' committee of Lime Street
Underwriting Agencies in the hope of recovering some of their losses, which
total millions of pounds.
The Lime Street agency, which handled the Names' affairs, put their assets
into some of the worst-performing syndicates in the recent history of
Lloyd's.
Initially 35 Names out of the 450 Lime Street members will seek
representation on the committee on the grounds that they would be creditors
in the event of future legal action against the agency.
Mr Guy Sutton, solicitor with Norton Rose, the firm which is advising the
Lime Street Names Association, said Lime Street Names were 'among the most
wounded by events at Lloyd's'.
The insurance market reported its first losses for 20 years last year when
it reported on the 1988 underwriting year.
Lloyd's will face a deficit of more than Pounds 1.3bn when it reports its
1989 results in June.
Many Lime Street Names are members of stricken catastrophe reinsurance
syndicates managed by agencies such as Feltrim, Gooda Walker, Rose Thomson
Young and Devonshire.
The Names wrote to Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, last December to
request an investigation into Lime Street and its associated companies.
However, Lloyd's has refused to inform the Names whether it is conducting an
investigation, saying any such matters are confidential.
Meanwhile Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, tabled a motion in the Commons
yesterday urging an inquiry into the relationship between the Lime Street
agency and associated companies; Mr Robin Kingsley, a director of Lime
Street; and syndicate 387.
Mr Hain said that in 1988 and 1989 Lime Street Underwriting 'contributed 70
per cent of Names' premium capacity' of Gooda Walker syndicate 387, which
specialised in stop-loss insurance - reinsurance for Names.
The Names stand to lose more than seven times the amount they had committed
to the syndicate.
He alleged that Mr Kingsley, a Name working in the market, reduced his
commitment to several troubled syndicates between 1988 and 1990 at a time
when other outside Names found it impossible to 'escape' from those
syndicates.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Chinese join leisure venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHINESE government plans to invest in a leisure development outside
Coventry in co-operation with private Saudi Arabian interests.
Coventry City Council said yesterday it would take part in the redevelopment
of Coombe Abbey Countryside Park, for which the Chinese will provide nearly
Pounds 6m for the Pounds 19m scheme. This is the first Chinese involvement
in a UK leisure venture and a rare expression of interest in the British
property industry.
Beijing is understood to have invested in US leisure developments. In the
late 1980s a Chinese regional government planned to set up a trade centre in
London Docklands, but the project foundered.
Coombe Abbey, where the buildings date back to the 11th century, is owned by
Coventry City Council. The abbey needs immediate expenditure of Pounds 2m to
make it weatherproof. The council said a venture involving external funding
would be the only way to secure its future.
The countryside park will include a hotel, conference and visitor centre, a
golf course and a health farm. Its owners will be the city council; Lumley
Castle Hotel, a Durham company; and a new company set up by the Chinese
government with support from the Saudi Arabians.
The total cost will be met by a Pounds 7m loan from the European Investment
Bank, a city council stake of Pounds 2.3m of which part will be European
Community funding, the Chinese-Saudi Arabian investment and bank loans.

FT  06 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Insurance 'key to boost investment'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT insurance could provide an important bridge between the needs of
many developing countries to improve their infrastructure and the reduced
willingness of banks and rich-country governments to provide credit.
This is a central conclusion of a report published today by the
Helsinki-based World Institute for Development Economics Research of the UN
University*.
The study, whose authors include Sir Kenneth Berrill, former chairman of
Britain's Security and Investment Board and Mr Frank Vibert, deputy director
of the Institute of Economic Affairs, draws attention to the growing desire
of developing country governments and those in eastern Europe to use private
sector capital to develop infrastructure.
A lack of credit from banks and export credit agencies has hit investment in
indebted developing countries. 'Traditional financial flows to developing
countries have been hit for six, and it's important other types of flows are
stimulated,' Sir Kenneth said yesterday.
Private insurance is currently obtainable against risk that investments may
be confiscated, expropriated or nationalised, against 'creeping
expropriation' - discriminatory measures by a government that make it
impossible in practice to carry on a business. However, most private
insurance is available only for a maximum 3 years and excludes war risk.
Official bilateral insurance, provided by 20 rich country governments,
offers long-term cover up to 15 years and against the three traditional
classes of political risk: war, expropriation and government curbs on
remittance transfers.
Such insurance has so far been used modestly: while officially insured
export credits to the developing world total Dollars 240bn, officially
insured investment totals about Dollars 18bn.
Existing investments are not covered and there are often quantitative limits
and gaps in geographical coverage. In theory private and official insurance
supplement one another, but in practice there is 'no neat dovetailing'.
It suggests a pooling of private sector and government sources of investment
insurance. Furthermore: 'The regional development banks, particularly in
east Europe, Latin America and Africa, might wish to set aside a part of
their capital to provide new capacity in the market probably through
offering a supplementary insurance facility.'
One drawback of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency - an investment
guarantee organisation linked to the World Bank - is its inability to
provide guarantees for existing investments.

deal

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OPPORTUNITIES for a compromise still exist within the deadlocked trade
liberalisation negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt), a close political adviser to Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl said
yesterday.
Mr Volker Ruhe, the secretary-general of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union (CDU), said the Uruguay Round deal must be based on agreement of the
European Community to limit its agricultural exports. At the same time the
US must agree not to move in on European markets with substitute products.
Speaking on his return from a high-level trip to Washington, during which he
had talks with a range of senior US administration officials, Mr Ruhe said
that it was vital for Germany that an agreement should be reached in April.
'If we don't, there is the danger of a strong resurgence of protectionism in
the US,' he said. 'That would hurt us all."
The significance of his trip is that it comes just two weeks before Mr Kohl
is himself due in Washington for talks with President George Bush, just one
month before the April 19 deadline set for the Gatt negotiations.
Mr Ruhe suggested that Germany's position, as the largest trading nation in
the EC, and a net agricultural importer, was actually closest to that of the
US, followed closely by the UK. He admitted that France, as a major
agricultural exporter, faced a very difficult challenge in the Gatt round.
"France is obviously in a very difficult situation,' he said. 'Many people
would like to push France into the limelight. That does not help. We must
come to a common position. It would not help us in Germany to go it alone."
His insistence that the US must agree not to boost its own agricultural
exports to fill the gap left by EC voluntary reductions is clearly intended
as an effort to lower the French resistance.

THE unsettled trading relationship between the US and Canada will be further
strained today after an expected ruling by the US Commerce Department that
Canadian provinces are subsidising exports of softwood lumber, reports
Bernard Simon in Toronto.
The finding, which would strike one of Canada's biggest exports to the US,
is expected to bring a barrage of protest, not only from Canadian lumber
producers, but also from the government in Ottawa.
The lumber ruling, coming on the heels of a controversial US Customs Service
decision earlier this week to deny duty-free access to Honda cars assembled
in Ontario, is bound to intensify political pressure on Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney to retaliate against US exports.
Mr Mulroney's government has made liberalised trade with the US one of the
planks of its economic policies, but is increasingly concerned at what it
perceives as aggressive protectionism in Washington. Two-way trade between
the US and Canada totalled CDollars 175bn (Pounds 84.5bn) in the first 11
months of last year.
Canadian sawmills sell about CDollars 3bn of lumber a year in the US,
accounting for a quarter of the market.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUJITSU, Japan's largest computer manufacturer, announced yesterday it plans
to sell its highest performance supercomputers in the US, a move the company
expects to create a political backlash.
'We have seen some Japan bashing, and we will possibly now see some Fujitsu
bashing,' said Mr Thomas Miller, vice-president of sales and marketing for
Fujitsu America's supercomputer group.
Fujitsu's entry into the US supercomputer market and efforts to expand sales
in Europe, pose a challenge to Cray Research, the leading US supercomputer
manufacturer and world market leader.
Initially, Fujitsu will try to limit political criticism by focusing its
marketing efforts on the US private sector. Japanese suppliers have been
effectively excluded from the public sector under pressure from Congress and
the Bush administration.
Last November, Fujitsu was forced to withdraw an offer to donate a
supercomputer to a Colorado-based international environmental research
project.
If Fujitsu is successful in the private sector it seems unlikely to ignore
the US public sector for long. Publicly funded sales represent about
two-thirds of the total US supercomputer market.
The US is under increasing pressure to open its public supercomputer market
to Japanese companies following an undertaking by the Japanese government to
allow US companies to bid for public computer purchases in Japan.
Fujitsu is also pre-empting charges that it will offer steep discounts in
the US as a way to garner sales of the ten models it plans to sell there.
'Our US prices will range from Dollars 2m to Dollars 17m, and are based upon
world-wide pricing at fair market values,' Mr Miller said.

<TEXT>
MOTOROLA of the US and Alps Electric of Japan have reached an agreement seen
as a possible forerunner to other collaborative deals between Japanese and
western companies.
The arrangement means that products based on the two companies' joint
semiconductor research in Europe can be brought to world markets this year.
Alps, an electronic components manufacturer, is the world's largest
independent maker of tuner modules used in television sets and video
cassette recorders (VCRs).
The US semiconductor and communications group will supply Alps with an
integrated circuit (IC) that the two companies designed and developed at
their research facilities in Switzerland and the UK.
The IC, which significantly reduces the size of the tuner module, is already
being manufactured at Motorola's semiconductor plant in Toulouse, France.
It will be used in Alps's next generation tuner modules to be manufactured
at the Japanese group's plant in the UK and Japan and supplied to television
and VCR manufacturers worldwide.
For Motorola, the deal, worth in excess of Pounds 25m over the next five
years, represents a significant step forward in winning over the Japanese.
The US group has often been critical in the past of the closed nature of the
Japanese market. But Japanese consumption of semiconductors is growing, in
Europe and worldwide.
'Semiconductor manufacturers have to learn to support Japanese customers
because, if you don't, you miss out on a huge market,' says Mr Barry Waite,
senior vice-president and general manager of Motorola's European
semiconductor group.
Motorola already supplies Japanese electronics manufacturers, such as Sony,
in Japan.
For Alps, the agreement with Motorola brings it close to achieving a
self-imposed target to buy 20 per cent of its domestic semiconductor
requirements from overseas manufacturers, says Mr Kyoshi Watano, managing
director of Alps UK.
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), under pressure
from the US, has asked leading corporations to buy 20 per cent of their
semiconductor consumption from foreign manufacturers.
With increasinginternationalisation of industry, 'what you are seeingfrom
Alps is not untypical of what you will be seeing from other (Japanese)
companies,' Mr Waite says.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Kerrey pulls out of presidential race
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE field of contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination narrowed
yesterday when Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska said he was ending his
campaign.
Mr Kerrey had been widely expected to be a popular candidate when he
announced last September that he would seek the presidency. But he has won
only a single state primary, and has failed to raise enough money to
continue campaigning.
'We had plenty of enthusiasm. Unfortunately we didn't have plenty of money,'
he said.
His withdrawal leaves the Democratic campaign as, in all likelihood, a duel
between former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts and Governor Bill
Clinton of Arkansas.
One other campaign, that of Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, appears in danger.
Also short of money, Mr Harkin has yet to win a primary, but hopes to keep
his presidential bid alive at least until the Illinois and Michigan
primaries of March 17, where his trade union support could help him.
In the Republican race, President George Bush yesterday flew to campaign in
South Carolina against Mr Patrick Buchanan, his right wing challenger, for
tomorrow's vote.
He attacked Mr Buchanan, who has embarrassed him by repeatedly winning 30 to
40 per cent of the votes in Republican primaries, for demagoguery.
'Anyone can demagogue but the president must make decisions. Sometimes you
have to make the tough call. The presidency is not a popularity contest,' he
said.
Mr Kerrey yesterday apologised for his recent attacks on the two Democratic
frontrunners.
'I have exercised political hyperbole on occasion and called them
unelectable, but with each passing day it is clear to me that the only
unelectable politician running for President of the US is George Bush,' he
said.
Mr Kerrey has in recent weeks bitterly attacked Mr Clinton for escaping the
Vietnam war draft, and said that Mr Bush would use this issue to 'open him
up like a soft peanut' in the presidential election.
Yesterday, however, he said that, if Mr Clinton won the Democratic
nomination, he would 'campaign feverishly to make certain he wins the
election in November'.
Enthusiastically supported by many of his colleagues in Congress, Mr Kerrey
brought to the race a gallant war record, a touch of film star glamour, a
reputation for standing up for his principles, and a biting tongue.
In addition, his principal policy plank - a proposal for a national health
insurance scheme - appeared to be high among voters' preoccupations.
But Mr Kerrey has seemed unable to move beyond health care and his war
record to articulate a vision of why he wanted to become the country's next
president.
His only victory came in South Dakota, next door to his native Nebraska. In
the seven states which held primaries or caucuses on Tuesday, his best
performance came in Colorado, where he won 12 per cent of the vote ' still
leaving him in fourth place behind former Governor Jerry Brown of
California, Governor Clinton and Mr Tsongas.
Nor were his prospects any better for next week's Super Tuesday contest; the
11 states which vote then seem likely to be split between Mr Tsongas and Mr
Clinton.
Mr Clinton is expected to dominate Super Tuesday because of his greater
appeal in the seven southern states voting that day.
But Mr Tsongas should win Rhode Island and his home state of Massachusetts,
and could gain a significant boost by upsetting Mr Clinton in Florida.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Democrat-dominated House of Representatives prepared yesterday to vote
on a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 850m) budget resolution that would double the
size of the 'peace dividend' by cutting defence spending more than President
George Bush wants, and lay the ground for a political battle over the US
budget.
Mr Tom Foley, the Democratic House Speaker, predicted it would approve a
budget plan that would shift money saved on reduced defence spending into
domestic programmes such as road-building and healthcare. 'Our budget is
realistic,' he said.
But the debate will measure the strength of support for preserving the 1990
budget agreement, in which Mr Bush and Congress agreed on higher taxes,
coupled with tight spending caps.
While President Bush said this week that he made a mistake in agreeing to
the 1990 budget compromise with Congress, he has nothing to gain by
overturning it now. The tax increases are already in place, and abandoning
the agreement would take away the spending curbs which he insisted on.
The US will need to cut federal spending and raise taxes to bring its budget
deficit under control, Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the
International Monetary Fund, said last night in an unusually frank critique
of US economic policy.
He said the Bush administration's budget projections showed that the 'fiscal
situation is worse than almost everyone thought.' The adjustment required
was so large that a 'combination of expenditure cuts and revenue measures
should be considered.'
He gave a heavy hint that the Federal Reserve will soon need to consider
increases in interest rates if it is to sustain progress in reducing
inflation.

CANADIAN banks will raise their prime lending rates today for the first time
in two years, Bernard Simon reports from Toronto.
Shortly after the Bank of Canada lifted its bank rate yesterday for the
fifth consecutive week, the banks announced they were raising prime rates
from 7.5 per cent to 8.25 per cent. The upward move reflects the Bank of
Canada's efforts to slow a fall in the Canadian dollar which has slid from a
peak of 89.30 US cents last November to below 84 cents earlier this week.
Mr Donald Mazankowski, finance minister, said yesterday that the rise in
interest rates should not be seen as a long-term trend. The government is
anxious to lower interest rates to help pull the economy out of recession.

VENEZUELA'S president yesterday announced a broad range of measures aimed at
easing widespread discontent with his government and providing a stronger
political base.
Mr Carlos Andres Perez, in a nationwide address, said his government would
call on Congress to organise a Constituent Assembly to draft a new
constitution within a short time. The new national charter will provide for
regular referenda.
A return to price controls on a limited number of items, such as basic food
products, motor gasoline and electric power rates was also announced. The
administration will ask Congress to approve a luxury tax and will revise
certain other taxes.
Measures, as yet unannounced, will be taken to control inflation and
regulate monetary liquidity. Investors are worried controls may be applied
to interest rates, which were freed from tight government regulation in
early 1989. The number of ministers will be reduced from 26 to nine and a
'cabinet of national unity' named, Mr Perez said.
In an effort to calm outcries over corruption, the president revealed
initiatives including the replacement of five out of nine members of the
Supreme Court, legislation on judicial reform and legal action against
individuals believed to have defrauded past governments.
Mr Alirio Parra, one of Venezuela's most experienced oil experts, has been
appointed minister of energy and mines.

FT  06 MAR 92 / China envelops colony's economy / A report on an ever-closer
economic relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE stock market is any indication of Hong Kong's future economic
prospects, its performance in the first two months of this year presages
great things for the colony's irrepressible economy.
The market has risen nearly 15 per this year - a rise explained almost
wholly by one word: China. China now holds the key to Hong Kong's economy in
a way it has not since before the Korean war.
Hong Kong's real gross domestic product grew by 'only' 4 per cent last year;
the government is expecting growth of 5 per cent this year while private
sector economists are expecting it to rise by 5.5 per cent. The basis of
this expansion are expected to be trade, investment and strong consumer
spending.
Mr Hamish MacLeod, financial secretary, said in his budget on Wednesday that
trade, the backbone of the economy, was expected to be buoyant with exports
growing by 14 per cent. Inflation, however, was forecast to remain high with
the gross domestic product deflator rising at an annual rate of 8.5 per
cent, and consumer prices expected to rise at a faster rate of above 10 per
cent.
Hong Kong's problem with inflation seems likely to remain. There is an
extremely tight labour market, with unemployment just 1.4 per cent and on a
declining trend, and the government has plans to import 25,000 workers this
year.
The inflation problem is also a consequence of the deep structural changes
in the economy. Hong Kong is becoming integrated into the southern Chinese
economy and a consequence of this is a shift to non-traded services away
from traded goods.
This marks a return towards the situation of the pre-Korean war period when
China accounted for about two thirds of the colony's trade. Today, it is
Hong Kong's biggest trading partner, accounting directly for over 30 per
cent. Much of this trade includes re-exports related to 'outward processing'
 -the export and import of goods, partially manufactured in either Hong Kong
or China and finished in either, for the international market.
In 1991, Hong Kong exported goods with a value of HKDollars 765.8bn (Pounds
56bn). Of these HKDollars 534.8bn were re-exports, more than 80 per cent of
which related to trade with China. As Nomura Research Institute recently
observed, Hong Kong is adopting a 'head office' role (marketing and finance)
and China the role of the factory.
The explosion in trade with China has sent shock waves throughout the
colony's economy. Employment in services related to trade, among other
things, has risen from 19.6 per cent in 1980 to 31.5 per cent at the end of
last year.
There has also been big investment by Hong Kong business in southern China
since China opened its door to foreign investment in 1979. Capital has
flowed into southern China, mainly neighbouring Guangdong.
By the end of 1990 Hong Kong had contracted to invest Dollars 23.4bn (Pounds
13.2bn) directly in China, representing 63 per cent of total contracted
foreign investment. Of this Dollars 11bn has been put to work, mainly in
Guangdong and its special economic zones, creating an estimated 2m jobs in
manufacturing in that region.
The rise of manufacturing there has led to a fall off in manufacturing
employment in the colony, as low and semi-skilled manufacturing jobs have
been exported north. In the reverse of what has been happening to employment
in services, Hong Kong's manufacturing labour force has fallen from 890,000
(or 37.5 per cent of the workforce) at the beginning of the 1980s to 655,000
at the end of 1991 (23.4 per cent of the workforce.)
However, although services might be providing growth to the colony's
economy, Hong Kong is far from becoming a wholly-services based
'post-industrial' society as some economists assert. The colony's
manufacturers have shown themselves to be formidable managers of their
sector's apparent 'decline'. Manufacturing industry's share of GDP has
remained remarkably constant on the back of sustained productivity
improvements and investment in new technology.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Miyazawa sidelined by scandals: The waning popularity of
Japan's prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POPULARITY of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, has sunk
so low that officials running an important by-election campaign for his
ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) have asked him to stay away.
The prime minister, who came to office just five months ago with an
ambitious domestic and international agenda, has been reduced to
near-impotence by political scandal and the agonisingly long argument over
whether Japan's rice market should be opened up.
Mr Miyazawa had hoped to make his mark as a leader who dealt successfully
with the challenge of enhancing Japan's contribution to world affairs.
Instead, he is most likely to be remembered for his inability to defuse
three separate scandals: the aftermath of the Recruit stocks-for-favours
affair, the Kyowa bribery case, and the unfolding drama of Sagawa Kyubin, a
transport company with links to gangsters.
The scandals, according to opinion polls, are uppermost in the minds of the
electorate in Miyagi, a farming district in northern Japan, who vote on
Sunday in a by-election for the lower house of the Diet (parliament). Rural
constituents are also angry with the LDP for hinting that Japan might open
its rice market to imports.
Mr Nobuo Onodera, the LDP candidate, and his campaign managers have asked Mr
Miyazawa and Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, to stay away from the
hustings.
'The bottom line is that they are just not wanted here. We told them not to
come,' said Mr Takayoshi Kono, a campaign manager.
The seat was left vacant by the death of the incumbent, an Social Democrat.
The opposition won the seat only in 1989, at the height of the Recruit
affair; Miyagi had been an LDP stronghold, and the party had hoped to win it
back.
Given the passions aroused in rural Japan by the rice issue, the campaign
would never have been easy for the LDP. But Mr Onodera, a popular local
politician and a former head of the prefectural assembly, hoped to succeed
by proclaiming his opposition to liberalising the market.
However, the scandals seem to have cut much of the ground from under his
feet. According to opinion polls, even LDP supporters plan to register their
anger by voting for a candidate sponsored by Rengo, the Japanese trade union
organisation.
Even though many Japanese have got bored with the endless flow of
allegations of political corruption, recent events seem to have inflamed
their anger once more. Interest was focused this week on a case dating back
to 1982. The Tokyo High Court, a court of appeal, acquitted Mr Fumio Yokote,
a former Diet member, of taking bribes from the National Federation of
Thread-Plying Industry Co-operatives Associations, a textiles grouping.
He had been convicted of taking Y2m (Pounds 8,780) from the association in
1982 in return for using his influence with government officials to secure
subsidies for the industry. The high court overturned the conviction on the
grounds that the only evidence against Mr Yokote was the testimony of two
alleged bribers.
The judge said their evidence was suspect because they had themselves been
charged with bribery in connection with other incidents and therefore may
have altered their evidence in the hope of securing lighter sentences.
The judgment and reasoning has provoked criticism. Daily Gendai, the tabloid
newspaper, said in a report yesterday that 'the judgment makes clear that
without a reform in the law, political reform is impossible'. An Asahi
newspaper editorial urged the public prosecutor's office not to be
discouraged by the verdict from pursuing future scandals with the greatest
vigour.
The scandal which has most directly hurt Mr Miyazawa is the affair in which
Recruit, a publishing company, tried to curry favour by handing out
cut-price stock.
Mr Miyazawa was finance minister when the scandal broke in 1988 and resigned
for his (minor) involvement. He admitted his secretary had accepted
cut-price shares. But now he is prime minister, opposition parties want to
re-examine his role in the affair by questioning one of his aides in the
Diet.
Mr Miyazawa has also been tarnished by the affair involving Kyowa, a steel
frame maker and property developer, which allegedly bribed Mr Fumio Abe, a
former minister and close associate of the prime minister. Mr Abe has been
charged with accepting about Y90m in bribes in return for disclosing
planning information.
In investigating links between Sagawa Kyubin and Inagawakai, a leading
criminal organisation, the public prosecutor's office has found evidence of
large flows of money to politicians. However, it has yet to find any hard
evidence of wrongdoing on the politicians' part.
If the LDP loses in Miyagi, its hold on the Diet's lower house will remain
unaffected. But a loss will do nothing to improve its prospects in the July
elections to the upper house, where the LDP lost its majority in 1989.
Under Diet rules, the party with a lower house majority can force many kinds
of legislation through the upper house. But bulldozer tactics run counter to
Japanese custom and practice.
Rather, the ruling party is expected to take account of public opinion as
expressed in elections, including by-elections, and adjust its policies
accordingly. Since 1989, this has produced a virtual impasse on important
legislation in the Diet, particularly in the field of political reform. The
LDP has discussed numerous plans, but Diet members have, not surprisingly,
found it impossible to agree on measures which would hurt their finances.

THE southern African governments pushing for a relaxation of the world ivory
trade ban announced yesterday they would drop demands for export permission
now if granted more control over their elephant herds, writes Robert Thomsom
in Tokyo.
Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana and Malawi made this proposal to the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) in Kyoto as it became
clear most of the 114 member states opposed lifting the ivory ban. Ivory is
one of the most emotive issues at the conference, which will also toughen or
relax protection of a wide range of other flora and fauna, and attempt to
set clearer standards for assessing if a species is endangered.
Instead of a total ban on ivory trade, the four governments want a
'voluntary moratorium' for a 'reasonable period.' They asked for 'time to
put in place a trading system that would not encourage illegal opportunities
for ivory trading' but made clear they expected limited trade to be
legalised in the longer term. Dr Simon Lyster of World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF) said the four countries were moving 'in the right direction.'

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chinese government yesterday turned up the heat on Britain's colonial
rulers of Hong Kong when a senior official objected to the government's
budget presented on Wednesday.
Mr Lu Ping, director of Beijing's Office of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs,
said in Guangzhou (Canton) yesterday that Mr Hamish MacLeod's budget
violated a stipulation in the Basic Law, Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution,
that government spending should be kept within the limits of the revenue it
raised.
He said it appeared as if the Hong Kong government had first determined its
expenditure needs and then sought ways of finding the revenue to fund
itself.
Although Mr Lu's comments had a familiar ring, a Hong Kong government
spokesman said he found Mr Lu's statements 'strange.'
The budget had been planned along normal lines and kept to the colony's
policy of not allowing the growth in expenditure to exceed the growth rate
of the economy.
He further stated that the budget was not in conflict with the Basic Law and
that even if it were it was of no concern of the Chinese government.
The Basic Law was a constitution which came into effect after the Chinese
government resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong, and not before, he said.
But Mr Lu's intervention is of a piece with Beijing's attempts, since the
signing of the airport agreement last September, to gain greater influence
over decision making in the colony before it is handed over to China in
1997.
In the airport agreement Britain formally recognised China's right to be
consulted over policies which straddle June 1997.
Since then the Chinese government has attempted to further its involvement
in the colony's affairs, notably through the creation of a 40-strong
'consultative' group of local worthies to advise it on Hong Kong matters.
China has also objected to the 'corporatisation' of Radio and Television
Hongkong, the semi-official broadcaster in the colony.

<TEXT>
THE Pakistani government was last night seeking to hold together the ruling
coalition in the troubled province of Sind following the death yesterday of
Mr Jam Sadiq Ali, the chief minister.
His 18-month rule was notorious for a political vendetta against opposition
activists led by Ms Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister. At the same
time, Mr Ali managed to hold together an alliance of independent MPs and a
smaller regional party to form the government in Sind even though Ms
Bhutto's Pakistan People's party emerged as the largest single group after
elections in October 1990.
Sind is the home base of Ms Bhutto, and events there are also seen as
crucial for the Pakistani economy.
The coalition plans to nominate the provincial minister for co-ordination
and home affairs, Mr Muzaffar Hussain Shah, as the next chief minister.
However, Ms Bhutto met party aides in Karachi, as government leaders were
attending Mr Ali's funeral, to see whether her party could now form a
government.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S central bank last night announced an effective float of the naira
as part of the most radical economic initiative since the government
launched its structural adjustment programme in 1986.
The decision will help restore the faith of Nigeria's creditors in what has
been a flagging reform policy, resolve a major policy difference with the
International Monetary Fund and lead to a shake-up of the banking sector.
But as the impact of what is expected to be a devaluation of 30 per cent of
more sinks in, President Ibrahim Babangida may face strong domestic
criticism. In a nationwide broadcast, Alhaji Abdulkadir Ahmed, governor of
the central bank, said that the value of the naira would be determined by
'going market rates'.
Currently there is an 80 per cent spread between the official and parallel
rates for the naira, bought and sold under a complex multi-tier system.
Bankers said the impact of what they described as a decision to float the
naira depended in part on the effectiveness of the liquidity squeeze and
promised curbs in government spending. But they expected an effective
devaluation of at least 30 per cent.
The broadcast comes as negotiations for a new stand-by agreement with the
International Monetary Fund get under way. Nigeria is hoping to renew an
18-month SDR319m facility and pave the way to further rescheduling of its
Dollars 34bn external debt later this year. The announcement ends two days
of uncertainty and speculation about the president's commitment to the
country's structural adjustment programme, undermined by an unrealistic
exchange rate and government overspending.
The uncertainty began when last Wednesday's weekly foreign exchange auction
conducted by the central bank, now to be discontinued, ended without the
customary declaration of the official rate. Although called an auction, the
rate was in fact set through informal consultations in the banking sector.
Nearly all applicants received a share of the foreign exchange made
available. Many of the country's smaller banks have made substantial profits
by doing little more than sell their quota at considerable premiums.
The governor criticised this abuse. The quota system now ends, although the
central bank will meet last Wednesday's applications. Banks will be free to
buy foreign exchange from any source, and sell within a margin of 1 per
cent.

THE African National Congress yesterday rejected proposals from the South
African government that members of black opposition groups should join the
existing cabinet to form a multi-racial interim government, writes Patti
Waldmeir in Johannesburg.
Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, said agreement had been reached
on the principle that a multi-racial interim executive should be appointed
by the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the all-party body
which is negotiating a post-apartheid constitution.
But this should not take the form of additions to the existing cabinet.
Rather, a multi-party body should be appointed over the heads of the
cabinet. This body would have veto powers over cabinet decisions and over
parliament.
The government had said on Wednesday that Codesa had achieved a 'major
breakthrough' on the issue, and that blacks would join cabinet soon.
Despite the disagreement, the two sides have recently made big progress in
bilateral discussions.

<TEXT>
THE BANK of Israel warned yesterday that 1991 profits at the country's
leading commercial banks would be wiped out by politically inspired
legislation which took effect yesterday enforcing extensive write-offs of
agricultural debts.
Central bank and finance ministry officials criticised a Knesset bill passed
on Wednesday which provided for the automatic write-off of 20 per cent of
the debts held by the 500 Moshavim collective farms, along with 21 Kibbutzim
settlements and 31 private farms, including that of Mr Ariel Sharon, the
housing minister.
The Moshavim farms are estimated to have outstanding bank debts of about
Shk2bn (Pounds 484m). The banks were already expecting to have to write off
more than Shk500m, but treasury officials said this was now likely to rise
to more than Shk1bn.
Mr Amnon Goldschmidt, the supervisor of banks at the Bank of Israel, said he
had told the banks, owned but not managed by the government, to incorporate
the write-off in their 1991 accounts, due to be published later this month.
He said the effect would be to strip the banks of any significant net profit
for 1991.
Although he added there was no threat to the overall stability of the banks,
officials said the bill would damage investor confidence in the system at a
time when the government is trying to sell off its shareholdings. Mr
Goldschmidt instructed the banks to include a full explanation of the affair
in their annual accounts especially for the benefit of foreign clients and
potential investors.
The legislation, passed easily despite objections from Mr Yitzhak Moda'i,
the finance minister, was pushed through with a clear eye on the farming
vote in the June general election. It was proposed by a member of the Labour
opposition which has strong ties to the collective agricultural sector.
It provides for appointment of an arbitrator to assess farms debts and
freezes any property confiscation in lieu of debts.

<TEXT>
THE German government yesterday launched a passionate defence of European
economic and monetary union in an attempt to counter a rising tide of
domestic criticism of the Maastricht treaty.
In an outspoken speech Chancellor Helmut Kohl's principal economic adviser,
Mr Horst Kohler, answered point by point the doubts raised by leading state
members of the governing council of the Bundesbank, and by politicians on
both left and right.
He presented the treaty as a great success for German economic and monetary
policy. 'We managed to achieve far more in my view, in the economic and
monetary union, than could ever have been expected at the beginning of the
negotiations.'
And it was achieved, he stressed, because the negotiating brief was agreed
'word for word' with the Bundesbank.
Mr Kohler, who is the state secretary in the Ministry of Finance, Mr Kohl's
'sherpa' for the summit meetings of the Group of Seven leading
industrialised nations and the leader of Germany's negotiating team in the
Emu talks, delivered his public address to a meeting in Karlsruhe.
He said that Germany was not bound to join a monetary union if its partners
did not interpret the economic preconditions for control of inflation and
government spending 'according to the spirit and letter of the treaty'.
He cited Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former president of the Bundesbank, as
supporting an immediate monetary union between Germany, France, the
Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. 'So why should it be wrong to realise a
monetary union, with comparable convergence criteria, at the latest by
1999?' he demanded.
He insisted that no German politician, given the fundamental passion of the
German voter for monetary stability, would accept any watering down of those
criteria.
He also rejected fears about the future stability of the Ecu, compared to
the D-Mark, insisting the currency would be bound by even more austere
stability requirements than the German currency.
At the same time he ruled out any budget increase of the size proposed by Mr
Jacques Delors, European Commission president, to help finance the
consequences of the Maastricht treaties.

A BREAKDOWN of wage negotiations between the German government, the 16
federal states, and trade unions representing 2.3m public sector workers
looked increasingly possible last night after union leaders rejected a
government pay offer of 3.5 per cent as 'absolutely unacceptable'.
Mrs Monica Wulf-Mathies, leader of the OTV trade union, was described by
reporters covering the talks in Stuttgart as 'raging' after the offer was
tabled by Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, on behalf of the
federal, state and local authorities. Unions representing 240,000 postal
workers, and 110,000 on the railways also rejected the package, which comes
in response to their pay claim of 9.5 per cent, plus increased holiday pay.
Alongside the pay negotiations of the nation's 4m engineering workers, which
began on Wednesday, the public sector deal is seen as critical to a wage
round which could tip the German economy firmly into recession. Already the
ill-organised banking workers are organising strikes, although without any
apparent effect as yet on the banking system.

FT  06 MAR 92 / BCCI may change Basle Concordat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS to stamp out lax regulation of international banks, in the wake of
last year's collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, are
being debated by regulators from the world's 11 most powerful central banks.
'It is an attempt to freeze out lax central banks,' said one central banker.
A draft document outlining tough new standards on inspection and supervision
of banks is being discussed in Basle by the Bank for International
Settlements committee on banking regulation.
Banks with headquarters in any country which did not enforce the new
standards would be banned from operating through branches in the main
industrial countries, if the proposals are accepted.
The hope is that this sanction would in turn oblige all central banks to
adopt the new standards.
The standards would insist that central banks have the resources and
expertise to verify whether banks with headquarters in their countries are
being run properly, taking account of the banks' offshore activities.
'Exactly how we monitor whether a central bank is enforcing those standards
is going to cause a lot of controversy,' the central banker said.
The standards, which will be debated for many months, would be an amendment
to the Basle Concordat on international banking supervision, a non-legally
binding agreement signed in 1983 by the Group of Ten leading industrial
countries together with Switzerland.
'There is a general consensus that the Concordat needs hardening, as a
response to BCCI,' the banker added. 'The proposals put before the committee
are the starting point for a debate.'
There have been criticisms that no central bank took proper responsibility
for verifying the soundness of BCCI, which had operations all over the
world. If the new proposals had been in effect, that responsibility would
have fallen on Luxembourg, BCCI's home country. 'There is going to be plenty
of argument about the new standards,' said a central banker.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR LEON Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner, yesterday launched a
strong counter-attack against his critics on two fronts - rejecting calls
for an independent European merger authority, and warning against the
creation of monopolistic 'Euro-champions' through mergers.
In a speech to a mainly German audience at a competition symposium in
Innsbruck, Austria, Sir Leon said that to wave through anti-competitive
mergers would be to subject European industry to 'a cruel deception'.
It was better to follow the Japanese example and encourage fierce
competition on the domestic market, he added.
Sir Leon's speech was partly aimed at his colleague Mr Martin Bangemann, the
EC industry commissioner, who is from Germany, and at Mr Wolfgang Kartte,
head of the German cartel office, who represent the two sides of the debate
on competition and industrial policy.
Mr Bangemann - who hit out last month at the influence of competition
'ayatollahs' on EC policy - believes that Sir Leon should sometimes take a
more lenient and less legalistic attitude to borderline merger cases. Mr
Kartte, for his part, has attacked the Commission for not being rigorous
enough.
In a passage obviously aimed at Mr Bangemann, who is also responsible for
the single market, Sir Leon said that the Commission's 17-month-old merger
control task force would continue to examine takeovers according to the
existing market situation.
'You cannot just assume, because we would wish it that way, that the whole
of the European Community is the true market for a product,' he added.
Mr Bangemann has criticised Sir Leon for recommending rejection of the
proposed Franco-Italian takeover of De Havilland, the Canadian aircraft
manufacturer, last October.
The European Commission has asked the German government to come up with an
urgent restructuring plan for the ailing east German shipbuilding industry,
as a condition for lifting the EC's ceiling on state aid to the shipyards,
writes Andrew Hill. Government grants to shipbuilders are covered by
legislation that outlaws production aid worth more than 9 per cent of
contract value.

FOREIGN MINISTERS from all 10 independent states bordering the Baltic Sea
agreed yesterday to revive historic trading and cultural links between them
and to create a community with its own specific identity, but closely linked
with existing European organisations, writes Robert Mauthner in Copenhagen.
In his opening statement, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign
minister, said he expected that, 10 years from now, all the countries in the
Baltic region would be either members of the European Community, or closely
linked to it. 'It means that it will be possible to speak of a Baltic
Community as a region within the European Community,' he said.
'Co-operation in the Baltic region should facilitate the linkage of the
European Community with the non-member countries of the region.'
The fundamental aim of the German-Danish initiative, which has brought
together Germany, Russia, Poland, all the Scandinavian states and the three
newly independent Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, is to
bridge the divide between western and eastern Europe and to tie the former
communist states into the free market system.
The conference yesterday decided to establish a Council of the Baltic Sea
States.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Poland's centre-right government led by Mr Jan Olszewski was
put in question yesterday when it lost a key economic policy vote in the
country's politically fragmented parliament.
The two-month-old government saw its policy document setting out the
guidelines for the budget rejected by 171-138 when a coalition of free
market liberals, former communists and the populist KPN party combined to
vote against it.
The guidelines sought to combine a commitment to financial stringency with
the promise of combating Poland's recession and thus drew fire from both the
monetarist wing in parliament and its opponents.
The vote came as the International Monetary Fund is anxiously looking to the
government to stick to its promise enshrined in the document to keep this
year's budget deficit to within 5 per cent of gross domestic product.
Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the finance minister, is due in Washington on March
16 for talks on the government's economic plans.
President Lech Walesa, meanwhile, demonstrated yesterday that he is able to
command a majority in parliament, where nine main parties jockey for
influence.
He won a comfortable majority for Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, his candidate
to head the National Bank of Poland, the central bank. The post has been
vacant since last summer when a banking scandal forced the previous
incumbent to resign.
The vote reversed a decision last December when parliament rejected Ms
Gronkiewicz Waltz on the grounds that the 39-year-old academic specialising
in banking law had insufficient experience for the job.
Yesterday's vote showed, however, that parliament had lost the stomach for a
long drawn-out confrontation with the president, who insisted that Ms
Gronkiewicz be accepted.
At the same time parliament's challenge to Mr Olszewski, the prime minister,
does not oblige the government to resign. But it may require a cabinet
reshuffle to broaden support for the budget vote to pass.
However, it does leave the finance minister without a clear basis on which
to construct the budget, which is to be ready by March 23.
The vote also shows that the government will be hard pressed to secure a
majority in the budget debate a month later, unless he reshuffles his
cabinet and broadens his support in parliament.
Should Mr Olszewski's cabinet fall over the budget the political initiative
would pass to President Walesa who could propose a non-party cabinet and
seek to impose it on a divided parliament.

MR Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, took his first decisive step
towards the market after three months of hesitation yesterday, naming a
reformer, Mr Volovymyr Lanovyi, as minister for the economy with a brief to
prepare a programme of radical change.
Government officials hinted that Mr Lanovyi's powers might be enhanced by
also making him deputy prime minister and creating a special presidential
economic reform team under his direction.
Mr Lanovyi, who as minister for privatisation offered an ambitious
privatisation package which was finally approved by parliament earlier this
week, has the credentials and the ambition to become a Ukrainian version of
Poland's Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, spearheading radical reforms.
However, he could be hobbled by a lack of real authority and opposition
within what remains a largely conservative cabinet.
Hardliners have also been promoted in Ukraine's slow motion cabinet shuffle
and yesterday a reformer, Mr Oleksandr Savchenko, lost his job as deputy
governor of the Ukrainian National Bank in a struggle with its conservative
head.
The balance of power lies with Mr Kravchuk, whom parliament granted expanded
executive authority yesterday.
Mr Kravchuk said that in the past year GDP has fallen by 21 per cent, the
government deficit has climbed to Rbs60bn and the rouble overhang - money in
savings accounts which consumers are unable to spend - has risen to
Rbs130bn.
Mr Kravchuk is also beset by a crisis in agriculture, traditionally the
mainstay of the Ukrainian economy.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Shooting threatens Moldova peace

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CEASEFIRE in Moldova was threatened yesterday when a truck driver
transporting militiamen was shot dead by machinegun fire in the
self-proclaimed Trans Dnestr republic, home of the Russian-speaking
minority.
The shooting came shortly after the ceasefire came into effect between the
Moldovan authorities, dominated by ethnic Romanians, and the minority based
in the republic on the east bank of the river Dnestr. At least nine people
have been killed in clashes over the past week.
As in the more severe conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the underlying tensions
are growing and neither side believes it is losing. In other respects,
however, the conflicts are quite different and illustrate the complexity of
conflict with which the former Soviet Union is now faced.
The Trans Dnestr conflict stems directly from the breakup of the Soviet
Union while Nagorno-Karabakh has been a source of tension between Azeris and
Armenians for centuries.
Moldova (formerly Moldavia) was finally taken under full Soviet control in
1944.
The Soviet leadership sought to stifle any attempts to preserve its former
links with Romania - calling Moldovan a separate language from Romanian, and
constructing a separate history for the Moldovan people.
Industry was largely situated on the left bank of the Dnestr, in the sliver
of the republic next to Ukraine, and largely staffed by Russians and
Ukrainians. Ukrainians and Russians together represent some 27 per cent of
the population, with Moldovans accounting for 64 per cent.
The little republic (4.5m people) was slow to respond to the stirrings of
reform. When it did, in 1989, a language movement quickly put the hardline
Communist Party on the defensive and it lost power in 1990 to the present
nationalist government, headed by President Mircea Snegur, the former
secretary of the Moldovan Party's central committee.
From the beginning of the nationalist movement, it was clear that the
Russian and, to a lesser extent, the Ukrainian minorities would be hostile,
reacting to laws establishing Moldovan as the official language and to calls
for renewed union with Romania with strikes and demonstrations, and, finally
last year, proclaiming Trans Dnestr independent under a Russian president,
Mr Igor Smirnov.
During the August coup last year, the Moldovan government stoutly rejected
it and the Trans Dnestr authorities welcomed it, siding with the Soviet army
in its brief efforts to impose military rule.
Thereafter, the two sides have gathered military forces. The Trans Dnestr
side has been augmented by Cossacks from nearby areas returning to their
traditional role as defenders of Russia's borders. The daily Izvestia
reported yesterday that the Cossacks appear to have appointed themselves
mercenaries for the Russians (they are paid from Rbs2,000 to Rbs5,000 a week
by the Trans Dnestr authorities).

FT  06 MAR 92 / BT to cut 25,000 jobs over 12 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT, the telecommunications group, plans to cut its workforce by up to 25,000
in the 12 months from April in response to growing competition and the
recession.
It will be one of the largest programmes of job losses in the recession.
The company intends to achieve the staff cuts through voluntary redundancy
or natural wastage. The current workforce of 218,000 typically experiences
natural wastage of 5,000-10,000 a year.
BT plans to write to all staff in the next few days giving them the
background to its decision to step up its programme of job cuts. It made no
official comment yesterday.
However, one executive said job losses would be higher than the 15,000
expected in the current financial year to the end of March and the 19,000 in
the previous year. He said 25,000 was at the 'upper end of the range'.
Redundant staff will include managers, as well as engineers, operators and
other staff.
Mr Tony Young, general secretary of the National Communications Union, which
represents many BT staff, said he was appalled at the suggested scale of job
losses. 'Clearly, the effects of the recession and the regulatory framework
imposed by the government are having a devastating effect on what should be
one of the UK's growth industries.'
Mr Young said the union would co-operate only if job losses remained purely
voluntary. It is negotiating a new voluntary redundancy package with BT.
BT has had a long-term programme of reducing staff numbers in a drive to cut
costs and improve efficiency.
It was reported 18 months ago that the company had drawn up a plan to cut
80,000 jobs over five years - a figure BT derided at the time. However, the
job cuts of the past two years and the planned reduction for next year mean
the company will have cut 60,000 jobs over three years and will be well on
the way to exceeding the 80,000 target.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Whitehall row foils freezing of Libyan assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISAGREEMENT within the British administration was responsible for the
failure to freeze Libyan assets which have been moved outside the reach of
UK jurisdiction, officials in Whitehall have confirmed.
Stiff, and ultimately successful, opposition to Foreign Office support for
such a move was mounted by the UK Treasury which feared that freezing
Libya's assets could damage London's position as an international financial
centre.
Official figures due for release next Tuesday are expected to show that
Libyan funds in London, which stood at more than Dollars 1.5bn at the end of
March 1991, fell to about Dollars 400m by the end of last year.
The inter-departmental tussle took place soon after November 14, when two
Libyans were indicted in the US and Scotland for the 1988 bombing of a Pan
Am airliner.
The Foreign Office became aware that Libya was moving its funds out of
London, and asked the Treasury to take steps to freeze them.
But, in a series of tense meetings and telephone calls, held over a weekend,
Treasury officials argued strongly against the freeze.
The Treasury's case was based in the first instance on legal grounds. The
Emergency Laws (Re-enactment and Appeals) Act 1964 stipulates that foreign
assets in Britain can only be frozen by Treasury order if their outflow is
to the economic detriment of the UK.
The Treasury solicitor argued that an assets freeze under this law would be
open to challenge. Ministers were ultimately convinced that the assets could
not be seized without special legislation, and that by the time such
legislation had passed there would be no assets left to seize.
The Treasury judged that an outflow of Libyan assets from London could not
be considered detrimental to the UK economy, largely because they were
comparatively small. Moreover, the Treasury traditionally has taken the view
that freezing foreign assets in the UK is action that should only be taken
as a last resort, such as in times of war or when there is international
agreement on such action through the United Nations.
Iraqi assets were seized after the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, but
that was done in implementation of decisions taken initially at EC level and
subsequently in the form of UN Security Council resolutions.
In the Libyan case, officials concluded that there would be no hope of
mobilising an international consensus for such action quickly enough to be
effective.
Underlying the Treasury's resistance to the proposed assets freeze was the
fear that it would undermine London's position as a financial centre.
A unilateral freezing of another country's assets, without any backing in
international law, could prompt other nations to shift their funds abroad.
Switzerland would be an obvious beneficiary of such action.
But the UK financial authorities also feared that rival financial centres in
the European Community, such as Paris, Frankfurt or Amsterdam, would be
quick to profit from a British freeze of Libyan assets.
Because of the tough competitive environment in which London operates and
the importance of the City for the UK economy, it was argued that Britain
could not emulate the US, which has frozen Libyan assets.
A British official yesterday firmly rebutted any suggestion that the plan
for a freeze had come from the US. It was, he said, a purely British idea,
and had not been discussed with the US government because it never became
British policy.

FT  06 MAR 92 / National Lottery plans to be unveiled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS for a national lottery to raise funds for arts, sports or cultural
projects will be unveiled today by Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary,
writes Ralph Atkins.
His announcement to the Commons appears to have been deliberately brought
forward as part of efforts to build momentum ahead of an announcement about
the general election.
Proposals for a lottery had previously been expected to be set out in the
Tory election manifesto.
Home Office ministers have for some time indicated support for a lottery but
their plans are thought to have met resistance from the Treasury because of
the impact on the football pools business. Estimates for how much a lottery
could raise range as high as Pounds 1bn a year.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Westminster poll fever mounts: Speculation on date of
election announcement overshadows NHS offensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT attempt to take the offensive over its National Health Service
reforms was swamped yesterday by a bout of feverish speculation as to when
an April 9 election would be announced.
As Mr John Major clashed with Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, on the
health issue at question time, MPs debated reports that the prime minister
would call an election next Wednesday - only 24 hours after the Budget.
Mr Major held a Downing Street summit last night with members of his
election 'A' team of cabinet ministers, including Mr Chris Patten, Tory
chairman, to finalise the Conservative election manifesto. Mounting
excitement at Westminster was fuelled by a new poll showing the two main
parties exactly level on 38.5 per cent with the Liberal Democrats at 18.5
per cent.
A Gallup 'snapshot' poll for The Daily Telegraph was accompanied by a Gallup
9000 poll of 10,405 voters, showing the Tories on 38.9, or a statistically
insignificant 1.3 points ahead of Labour in soundings taken over the past
month.
Whatever the parties' true positions, the polls show Labour support has not
grown fast enough to prompt reconsideration of an April 9 date.
As analysts predicted the narrowest election race for decades and stock and
money markets dipped on fears of a change in Downing Street, the day's
events were dominated by bar room tacticians trying to calculate the
strategic advantages to the Tories of making the election announcement 24
hours earlier than most had expected.
One theory had it that an early election call, backed up by a prime
ministerial address to the nation on television, would switch attention away
from the Budget statement and Labour's counter attack. It would also detract
from Mr John Smith's right as shadow chancellor to a 10-minute television
'reply' to the Budget,
Tory campaign officials insisted no final decision had been taken on timing
and that the issue had not even been raised during a political discussion
after yesterday's cabinet meeting. Downing Street said Mr Major had
scheduled a normal weekend in his Huntingdon constituency.
But there was evidence of a government clearing its desks for an election as
ministers announced nearly Pounds 400m of spending on projects ranging from
roads for Scotland to grant aid for technical schools.
The 'business as usual' message cut little ice in the Commons where Mr John
MacGregor, Leader of the House, came under opposition fire for announcing a
normal statement for next week's business.
In fact, as soon as the election is called, he will have to cut short the
traditional four-day Budget debate, introduce a truncated Finance Bill, and
ensure remaining business is rescheduled or abandoned. The Commons must be
prorogued by the night of Monday March 16 for an April 9 election.
In the Commons, Mr Kinnock promised a Labour government would end tax
concessions for private health insurance and use the Pounds 60m annual
saving 'to fight cancer'. The prime minister retorted that Labour's promises
would have more credibility were it not committed to a minimum wage which
would cost the NHS Pounds 500m.

FT  06 MAR 92 / British Gas to buy Ulster's biggest power station
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent and JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS is to buy Ballylumford, Northern Ireland's largest power
station, and build a pipeline to bring natural gas to the province for the
first time.
The privatisation of Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE), details of which
were released by the government yesterday, will raise Pounds 353m for the
company's four power stations, Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary,
said in a Commons written answer yesterday.
The sale of the power stations, effective from March 31, will form the first
stage of the privatisation of NIE.
The company's supply and distribution business will be sold to the public in
November.
British Gas will pay Pounds 132.4m for Ballylumford, in County Antrim, which
generates half of Northern Ireland's electricity. Although the 1,000MW
station runs on oil, British Gas has undertaken to convert it to gas, which
will be imported through a new pipeline from Scotland.
Two other power stations will go to a consortium of the US power company,
Applied Energy Services, and Tractebel, the Belgian power conglomerate.
The consortium will pay Pounds 214m for Kilroot, a 520MW station in County
Antrim, and the 240MW Belfast West coal-fired station.
NIE's fourth station, the 420MW oil-fired Coolkeeragh plant in Londonderry,
will be bought by a management-employee team from NIE for Pounds 6.5m.
Mr Richard Needham, Northern Ireland minister, said he was particularly
pleased by the sale of Ballylumford to British Gas, since it meant customers
in the province would not only have gas-fired electricity for the first time
but might hope to have the choice of gas in their homes in the future.
British Gas said it was delighted with the success of its bid, which would
help to expand its power generation business, along with plans for other
power stations in Bristol, London, and overseas.
The company has set a subsidiary, Premier Transco, to build and operate the
new pipeline, and a second company, Premier Energy Suppliers, to market
natural gas in Northern Ireland.
Mr Needham said the privatisation, which has faced strong local opposition
from politicians, trade unions and other groups, would be a great confidence
boost to the Northern Ireland economy.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Appointments: Experience as well as pedigree
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Bio-technology's boss Keith McCullagh calls it 'the brain drain in
reverse'; the young and innovative Oxford-based pharmaceutical company has
lured Peter Lewis from Marion Merrell Dow, the big American drug company,
onto the board as its new head of research and development.
Lewis will oversee everything from basic research through to the
registration of new drugs. Unlike many biotechnology company heads,
McCullagh does not believe in hiring straight from academe - and Lewis has
the industrial experience as well as the intellectual pedigree. At Merrell
Dow since 1984, Lewis, who is English, was one of the few executives to be
promoted to head office in Kansas City at the time of the 1989 merger - most
of the senior management in the combine coming from Marion. He was latterly
responsible for clinical, medical and development research.
McCullagh says the new recruit, who is 47, complements the skills of
research director John Gordon, a pharmacologist whose strengths are in
pre-clinical development. 'As chief executive I had been acting head of
research and development, so now I have more time to devote to the
commercial development of the company,' says McCullagh.
British Bio-technology has three drugs in clinical trial this year -
p24-VLP, designed to delay the progression of Aids, which will shortly be
tested on HIV-positive patients; a drug that may prevent the spread of
primary cancers, and an anti-inflammatory treatment for asthma.
And why would Lewis be interested in moving back to Britain and a small
company with nothing actually on the market? 'Because he is enormously
enthusiastic about the drugs we have in development,' is McCullagh's answer.

FT  06 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A BIG seller in stock index futures early in the session triggered heavy
falls in the March contract on the FT-SE and in the underlying cash market,
writes Joel Kibazo.
March started the session at 2,560 and was squeezed higher to 2,564 within
minutes of the market's opening.
However, a sizeable offer of the contract at around 10am started in what one
dealer called 'panic selling', sending March into retreat to trade at a
discount to fair value for most of the session thereafter and also leading
the underlying cash market lower.
The tentative opening on Wall Street and large buying from one securities
house failed to halt further falls in the contract.
March closed at 2,542, some 3 points below its estimated fair value premium
to cash of around 6. Turnover at 7,500 was an improvement on recent levels.
In LTOM, turnover was also healthy, reaching 36,401 contracts. The FT-SE 100
index option was particularly busy, trading 10,736 lots. Among stock
options, Land Securities led the league table with 3,063 lots dealt. This
was followed by BAT at 2,364, and Rolls-Royce, which reported full-year
figures, at 2,258 lots traded.

FT  06 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities upset by political concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL and economic factors returned to centre stage in the London stock
market yesterday, competing with the flow of corporate results for the
attention of investment fund managers.
An opinion poll, unconfirmed but clearly leaked in the UK press, indicated a
five point lead for the Labour opposition party in key marginal electoral
constituencies, and set the background for a weak stock market. Equally
disturbing was a fall in sterling and in UK government bonds, both
challenging confidence in prospects for the cut in base rates which has been
virtually built in to stock market calculations.
The market opened lower, with confidence additionally bruised by the 21
point fall in the Dow Industrial Average overnight, and soon began to follow
the downward trend of other European bourses. At the day's low point, the
FT-SE Index was 23.5 down at 2,534.9 but London steadied when Wall Street
cut its loss to 1.57 early in the new session. The final reading showed the
FT-SE at 2,538.3, down 20.1.
Trading volume remained high, boosted by completion of the trading programme
which surfaced at the close of the previous session, and also by a handful
of large corporate trades. The trend was established early when Singer &amp;
Friedlander, the merchant bank, followed up the deals reported late on
Wednesday by announcing that it was operating the authorised purchase of up
to 33.6m shares.
The company reporting list was again heavy and, on balance, favourable to
the market's confidence. Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine group, supported the
recent trend by maintaining its dividend payment in spite of a heavy fall in
profits. Results from Ladbroke, the leisure and hotels group, were also well
taken in the market.
But the mood of the equity sector sounded less than happy as strategists
weighed up the outlook ahead of the budget speech on Tuesday and the UK
general election expected to follow soon after. Government bonds, a full
point off on Wednesday, shed a further half point at one stage yesterday as
investors continued to shy away from warnings regarding the level of the
Public Sector Borrowing Requirement.
Pharmaceutical stocks, which exert considerable influence on the Footsie,
looked steadier at first as the sector tried to rally from its weakness on
Wall Street. But by the close, most of the leading names were easier, and
the sector lacked the support from the US which will be needed for a genuine
recovery in London. Wellcome, however, continued to stabilise after the
setback provoked by the Foundation's decision substantially to reduce its
stake in the equity.
The bout of nerves surrounding base rate hopes showed itself in a round of
losses among store and similar consumer issues, whose fortunes are closely
linked with hopes that a revival in consumer spending will lead the way out
of recession in the UK.
Seaq volume increased sharply to 608.4m shares from 530.5m in the previous
session. Wednesday's retail, or customer-originated, business was worth
Pounds 1.2bn, once again indicating a return to healthier trading levels in
the London equity market. Trading volumes have increased significantly in
the past two sessions, both featured by weaker share prices.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Appointments: Tyree quits Salomon for Lehman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
American Daniel Tyree, who has left Salomon Brothers after 17 years, is to
become vice chairman of Lehman Brothers International, where he will be
running the day-to-day aspects of the investment bank's London-headquartered
business.
Tyree, 43, who insists he left Salomon because he was 'ready for a change
after 17 years', says he looked carefully for a firm where he wanted to
spend the rest of his working career.
Among the wave of resig-nations hitting the Wall Street firm, Tyree's is one
of Salomon's more high profile losses. As head of the high yield bond
business in New York for the past two years, he has successfully brought the
firm up the league tables following the demise of Drexel.
Between 1987 and 1989, Tyree was based in London as head of Salomon's
worldwide investment banking operations outside the US.
Lehman says the appointment is designed to supplement its management team in
Europe. Tyree explained yesterday that he would be working closely with
Steven Spiegel, current chairman and ceo of Lehman Brothers International,
who will concentrate on developing the firm's overall European business.

THE CARACAS stock market recovered partially yesterday from Wednesday's 6
per cent drop as President Carlos Andres Perez promised political reform and
suspended price increases on gasoline, electricity, food and medicine,
writes Joseph Mann.
Before the Carnival holiday, equities had been recovering, in local currency
terms, from a failed coup in February. However, the decline in the bolivar
against the dollar accelerated after the failed military rebellion. The
currency dropped 4 per cent on Wednesday but showed some strength yesterday.
Meanwhile, the Mexican stock market is showing the first sign of jitters
this year, writes Damian Fraser. The market opened 0.4 per cent lower
yesterday after a 3.5 per cent fall on Wednesday on news that the government
planned to sell a further 5 per cent in Telmex, the country's telephone
monopoly. News of the offering, which could fetch about Dollars 1.5bn, is
scheduled for May or June.
Mexican equities fell in spite of a drop in interest rates to a record low
of 12.5 per cent, compared with inflation of 17.9 per cent. Interest rates
have fallen thanks to growing credibility in Mexico's exchange rate policy.
Since November the peso has fallen at an annualised rate of only 2.4 per
cent against the dollar.

stocks pull Nikkei lower
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARP falls in leading high-technology issues pulled the Nikkei average
down, although volume rose on continued activity in bio-technology related
issues, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-share average closed down 241.00 at 20,864.42, the day's low,
falling below the 21,000 level for the first time in eight trading days. The
day's high was 21,112.44.
Volume rose to 300m shares from 230m, hitting the 300m mark for the first
time since January 31. Traders attributed the increase in activity to large
lot index-linked trading by foreigners and buying by individuals.
Declines led advances by 699 to 255 with 150 unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks fell 13.49, and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
eased 1.14 to 1160.30.
Individual investors supported the chemical and foods sectors, which were
the only gainers of the day. In the afternoon session, some investors took
profits on stocks which had gained sharply during the past few trading days.
Mochida Pharmaceutical fell Y20 to Y4,160 and Dainippon Pharmaceutical by
Y60 to Y1,970.
However, active trading spread to other bio-technology related issues, and
renewed interest in Aids-related shares lifted Meiji Milk Products up Y92 to
Y1,020 and Morinaga Milk by Y22 to Y721. 'Investors who are trading on the
drug theme are not the middle to long-term holders, but they are acting as
catalysts for the market,' said Mr Takatoshi Okuyama at Daiwa Securities.
Some investors and dealers are now hoping that popularity in drug issues
will shift to 'environmental protection stocks'. Daicel Chemical Industries,
the organic chemical maker, rose Y14 to Y640 on hopes that its
bio-degradable plastic will contribute to a rise in profits. Mitsubishi
Kakoki Kaisha, a manufacturer of water treatment equipment, was the most
active issue of the day, adding Y60 to Y960.
Concerns over earnings for the current year depressed NEC, which lost Y35 to
Y995, falling below Y1,000 for the first time since October 1985 and
Mitsubishi Electric, down Y13 to Y498, suffering the first dip below Y500
since March 1987. Brokerage houses also declined on worries over current
year profits. Nomura Securities fell Y60 to Y1,340 and Daiwa Securities lost
Y15 to Y860.
Minolta Camera fell Y24 to a 14-month low of Y421. The company agreed to pay
Honeywell Y16.6bn over a patent dispute. Investors were discouraged as the
final settlement amount was larger than previously expected.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 120.41 to 22,170.75 in volume of 141m shares.
Crown, an audio equipment manufacturer, fell Y200 to Y1,010. Osaka
Securities Finance, the securities financing company with close ties with
financial regulators, and sole lender of stock for margin trading in Osaka,
said that it would not finance or lend stocks for trading in Crown shares,
due to their erratic price movements.
Roundup
HONG Kong, which closed at its second consecutive record high, stood out in
a featureless Pacific Rim.
HONG KONG finished off its intra-day high: the Hang Seng Index closed 9.79
higher at 4,964.29 in turnover of HKDollars 2.54bn against HKDollars 2.37bn.
Investors were encouraged in early trade by the details of Wednesday's
budget, although profit-taking later pushed the index lower.
Hutchison Whampoa closed down 50 cents at HKDollars 15.40 on worries of a
possible rights issue, while parent group Cheung Kong finished down 20 cents
at HKDollars 21.40.
SINGAPORE closed weaker as sentiment remained nervous on fears of worse than
expected company results due to be published later this month. The Straits
Times Industrial index ended down 3.08 at 1,456.84 in volume of 34.34m
shares against 44.10m.
Sembawang Shipyard fell 5 cents to SDollars 7.45 in spite of announcing a 30
per cent increase in 1991 net profit.
SEOUL shed most of Wednesday's gains after the government denied that it
planned measures to boost the financial services sector. The composite index
lost 11.24 to 619.23 in turnover of Won343.3bn.
MANILA's decline continued with worries of violence ahead of May's
presidential elections. The composite index fell 2.37 to 1,1157.61 in
turnover of 158.3m pesos against 74.3m pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR continued to consolidate and the composite index fell 4.71 to
593.93 in volume of 29.2m against 35.8m. Analysts said that investors were
now concentrating on the public issue of the power utility, Tenaga Nasional.
BANGKOK was led higher by strong gains in the finance sector. The SET index
closed up 7.69 at 800.85, in turnover of Bt5.65bn.
BOMBAY remained closed for the second consecutive day amid rumours that some
brokers were facing problems in honouring payments. On Tuesday, the BSE
Index extended a three-day rally rising 139.53 or 4.19 per cent, to a record
high of 3,472.78.
AUSTRALIA closed lower for the third consecutive day. The All Ordinaries
Index ended down 6.9 at 1,608.3 in turnover of ADollars 187.8m.
CRA, which reported a 26 per cent fall in net profits on Wednesday, fell 18
cents to ADollars 13.92.
NEW ZEALAND closed with the NZSE-40 index 3.53 lower at 1,465.18 in turnover
of NZDollars 15m. Brierley Investments, which reported a 48 per cent decline
in half-year profits, shed 1 cent to 98 cents.

MOST BOURSES eased back yesterday, as a dull start on Wall Street gave
little incentive to extend recent gains, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS saw profit-taking in recent favourites such as Alactel Alsthom and the
CAC 40 index fell 15.05 to 1,973.04 in turnover of FFr2.24bn.
The television company, Canal Plus, fell FFr47 or 4.1 per cent to FFr1,105
in 48,749 shares on government support for the introduction of
high-definition television, which would not be compatible with Canal Plus's
decoders.
The food retailer Carrefour lost FFr77 or 2.9 per cent to FFr2,603 following
news late on Wednesday that its 1991 profit fell 11 per cent.
FRANKFURT enjoyed selective blue-chip buying which left Daimler and
Volkswagen higher in carmakers, the former leading active stocks in turnover
of DM1.4bn within a day's total of DM7.9bn, up from DM7.8bn on Thursday.
The FAZ index fell 0.61 to 714.36 in midsession, but the DAX closed with a
gain of 5.25 at 1,674.80. Volkswagen rose another DM7.40 to DM376, rising
this time on additional shifts at its Audi subsidiary to deal with strong
demand, especially for its new 80 model.
Meanwhile the tyremaker, Continental, which was the subject of a long
courtship by its Italian counterpart, Pirelli, rose DM7.20 to DM247
following a press report than an Italian businessman, Mr Salvatore Ligresti,
had bought a 5 per cent Conti stake.
MILAN remained weak, and dealers expect prices to be further depressed today
following news late yesterday that a modified car insurance reform had
failed to go through parliament. The Comit index fell 5.26 to 520.44 in
turnover estimated at L75bn after L69.1bn.
Domestic selling pushed Fiat savings shares down by L140 or 3.8 per cent to
L3,590 on fears of a dividend cut. Fiat's ordinary shares fell L62 or 1.3
per cent to L4,870. The cement sector was also under pressure, with Cementir
losing 6.5 per cent or L155 to L2,220.

SFr2,030. Credit Suisse, the latter's major asset, releases its 1991 results
this morning.
AMSTERDAM remained unmoved by a batch of better-than-expected company
results and the CBS Tendency Index closed unchanged at 128.1 in turnover of
Fl 615.3m.
Heineken fell Fl 3.30 or 1.94 per cent, to Fl 166.60 as investors took
profits ahead of the 1991 results which came out after the market had
closed.
BRUSSELS closed lower in moderate trade: the Bel-20 finished down 10.68 at
1,22.57 in turnover of BFr700m. Groupe AG, the insurer, and Generale Bank,
fell as officials of both companies said that a possible merger remained
some way off. The insurer declined BFr95 or 4.2 per cent to BFr2,160 while
the bank shed BFr170 or 2.5 per cent to BFr6,550.
STOCKHOLM's forestry sector, higher on the rising US dollar and pulp price
hopes, helped the Affarsvarlden General index to a further gain of 6.60 to
980.60.
The metals and industrial group, Trelleborg, which reported a 78 per cent
drop in 1991 profits after hours, saw its B shares down SKr7 to SKr119 in
anticipation of the event.

FT  06 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Government puts brakes on Taiwan's
rally - But the stock market speculators might not stay away for long
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUISETTA MUDIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT action to prevent what it saw as a return to the destructive,
speculative fever of two years ago appears to have nipped Taiwan's New Year
stock market rally in the bud.
Analysts say, however, that the country's bright economic outlook and
relative political stability suggest the speculative money might not stay
away for long.
The stock market's 17.2 per cent rise in January was mainly
liquidity-driven, as is traditional in the weeks before the Chinese New
Year, with year-end bonuses and settling of accounts boosting the amount of
money in circulation.
The victory of the Nationalist Kuomintang government in last December's
National Assembly elections also boosted confidence, as fears about
political stability, generated by opposition calls for independence, were
temporarily abated.
Most of the island's top 40 industrial stocks rose in line with the market
in January, with President Enterprises showing a 20 per cent increase and
Uniglory Marine a rise of 41.3 per cent in that month. A notable exception
was Microelectronics, normally a favourite with foreign investors, which has
seen a big fall-off in earnings since this time last year. Its shares rose
by a mere 1.9 per cent during January's rally and have since fallen by
around 10 per cent.
But when trading resumed on February 8, after the week-long Chinese New Year
holiday, the stock market tumbled by 2.9 per cent as domestic investors, of
whom around 85 per cent are individuals, deserted equities in droves. There
were widespread fears that the central bank would tighten monetary policy
after Prime Minister Hau Pei-tsun expressed concern that the stock market
was losing touch with reality.
With the painful memory of the 1990 crash still present, when the weighted
index plunged by 80 per cent, the government's policy towards the stock
market has increasingly been to clamp down at the first sign of overheating.
The central bank's pledge to keep a tighter rein on the money supply after a
20 per cent rise in the M2 measure in January, has had a dampening effect on
the stock market. The central bank has also issued more than TDollars 72bn
(Dollars 2.9bn) of bonds and bills since February 8 in an attempt to mop up
excess liquidity, but, analysts say, with only limited success to date.
However, it was the central bank's decision in mid-February to put a squeeze
on the inflow of foreign equity investment capital, just one year after
opening the market to foreigners, that came as the biggest shock. The
central bank's decision to suspend funds from abroad for purchases of
equities in Taiwan was apparently aimed at relieving upward pressure on the
local currency against the US dollar.
Even so, it aroused worries about investing in the island. The weighted
index fell by 3.3 per cent on February 17 and another 1.9 per cent the
following day to the month's low of 4,766.91, a fall of 11.6 per cent from
the year's high of 5,391.63 on January 30.
The unofficial ban is still in effect, although the bank decided in
principle last week to consider new applications, provided that they were
subject to strict scheduling requirements and a daily ceiling of Dollars 5m.
The central bank has said it is waiting for foreign exchange markets to
stabilise before the inflow of foreign funds into the island can return to
normal.
The stock market has since recovered, the weighted index closing at 5,033.53
yesterday. Analysts say the prospects look good for a solid first half, but
they do not expect the index to rally beyond 6,000. Government plans to
issue up to TDollars 192.5bn of bonds between February and June are intended
to keep up the drain on liquidity.
With such a high proportion of individual investors, however, Taiwan's stock
market is likely to remain volatile and vulnerable to manipulators, who ramp
share prices up and down, followed en masse by individuals who aim to take
profits in their wake.
Mr Steve Champion, of International Investment Trust, says that for the
manipulators to be less effective, more foreign and institutional investment
will be needed. As another analyst said: 'It's still a rocky road to
maturity.'

FT  06 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Jitters fuel trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTACK of political jitters injected life into the UK money market
yesterday, and rates firmed across the spectrum.
A leaked NOP opinion poll showing the opposition Labour party with a
five-point lead in 50 marginal seats kindled fears that the Conservative
government could be toppled in the general election, expected on April 9. A
fall in sterling against the D-mark increased the nervousness, arousing
fears that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, may no longer have room to cut
interest rates without bringing sterling under pressure.
A survey of traders on Wednesday had found eight out of ten still expecting
a near-term cut, with 44 per cent of those believing it would come between
Budget day on March 10 and a likely election announcement on March 16.
Yesterday, however, that optimism seemed to be crumbling, as operators took
back their money in all periods.
The key three-month interbank rate, often a pointer towards future base
rates, moved up to 10 1/2 -10 3/8 per cent, having climbed gradually from
around 10 1/4 per cent two weeks ago. The six-month rate moved out to 10
7/16 -10 3/8 from 10 5/16 -10 3/16 , and the 12-month rate climbed  3/16 to
10 7/16 -10 5/16 .
The March short sterling contract dropped four basis points to 89.59, and
June fell to 89.79 from 89.88.
Overnight rates started around 10 5/8 -10 1/2 but firmed after the Bank of
England forecast the daily shortage at Pounds 500m, but purchased only
Pounds 10m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent at midday, having not
operated in the early round. The forecast was later revised to Pounds 550m,
and the Bank purchased Pounds 47m of band 1 treasury bills and Pounds 138m
of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance of Pounds 180m took
the total for the day to only Pounds 375m.
The overnight rate climbed as a result to 11 1/2 -11 per cent.
German call money rates eased slightly, but the Bundesbank seemed determined
to keep them above 9.60 per cent. Most trade was at 9.60 per cent rather
than Wednesday's 9.65.
Dealers said the Bundesbank was at a delicate stage in pay negotiations, and
hit by inflation fears, but could not raise interest rates because of
foreign pressure. It was therefore keeping market rates tight through its
open market operations.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Heavy selling halts dollar rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEMPTATION proved too much for some investors who decided to take profits
once the dollar hit DM1.68 after another day of climbing, writes Neil
Buckley.
The morning had seen the US currency take a rest after its surge in the
previous three days, but in the afternoon it powered through resistance at
DM1.6740 and DM1.6780 until its arrival at DM1.6800 triggered heavy selling
by investors anxious to guarantee profits before today's US payroll figures.
These will be the focus of attention, with dealers looking for further
evidence of US economic recovery, although nervousness persists that the
figures may disappoint.
The dollar retreated at the close to DM1.6725/30, little changed on the day.
Against the yen, it slid back from a Y132.43 high to Y132.10/20, but was
still above its 132.05/15 start. In New York last night it fell back
slightly to DM1.6707 and Y131.80/90 at midsession.
'There were no economic fundamentals yesterday so the market had nothing to
focus on, but there was still a lot of short-term speculative buying,' said
an economist with a UK bank. 'We're seeing whippy trading in the course of a
longer-term bull run.'
In Tokyo, the dollar had continued upwards, supported by active technical
demand after it broke through key resistance at DM1.67 and Y132. It closed
at DM1.6725 and Y132.00.
Japanese investors were said to be buying large amounts of dollars which
they sold last month, and while some fears about Bank of Japan intervention
remained, dealers believed this would be ineffective.
The D-mark's four-month low against the dollar did not stop it from
continuing its long climb against the Swiss franc, reaching SFr0.9112/24, up
from SFr0.9097/0.9109 on Wednesday. The Swiss currency was the centre of
attention in Europe as rumours abounded that the Swiss National Bank was
holding an emergency meeting. No intervention took place, however.
The SNB also refused to comment on speculation that it was about to create a
new Lombard rate two percentage points higher than the present rate, a
rumour which helped lift the Swiss franc from its lows.
The German currency fell slightly against the French franc and lira, but was
steady within the EMS at around 31 per cent above its central rate.
This was partly due to a strong performance against sterling, which fell on
nervousness induced by an opinion poll that was favourable to the opposition
Labour party.
Sterling closed at DM2.8700/03, down more than a pfennig from the might
before. It remained pinned to the foot of the EMS table, slipping to 44 per
cent below its central Ecu rate from 39 per cent on Wednesday, and sparking
fears that a UK base rate cut might now be too risky.
Against the dollar, sterling weakened to Dollars 1.7165 from Dollars 1.7235.

tea estate

HARRISONS Malayalam, part of the Rs2.5bn (Pounds 54m) RPG group, plans to
set up a tea estate in the West Dinajpur district of West Bengal that
promises to set new standards of productivity in the Indian tea industry.
The company has decided to take the route of clonal plantation in its effort
to achieve a productivity rate of 3,500 to 4,000 kg a hectare, compared with
present yields averaging about 2,500 kg a hectare at its existing
plantations in the south Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The company
is acquiring 1,000 hectares for the Rs150m project, according to Mr K
Ahmedulla, executive director.
Highly productive clones will be supplied by the Toklai tea research centre
and planted at the optimum density of 14,000 a hectare, compared with about
10,000 plants a hectare in most existing tea estates. Planting is to start
by June 1992 and should be completed within seven years. Production is
forecast to reach 3.5m kg a year in ten years.
The company also plans to set up a modern processing factory adjoining the
estate.
The company hopes to produce 15m kg of tea in 1992, up from 14m kg last
year, at its tea estates in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, covering 6,000 hectares.
Tata Tea, India's largest plantation company, and Krasnodar Tea Company have
formed a joint venture in Russia called Tata Krasnodar Industries in which
the partners will have equal holding.
The objective is to promote the export of Indian tea and other agricultural
products to Russia. The company has acquired a tea blending and packaging
plant at Sochi from Krasnodar Tea.
Packet tea produced at the plant will be labelled 'an Indo-Russian Star
Product.'
Tata Tea, which has secured an initial order of 3m kg of black tea, worth
Rs160m, from Agroras, the Russian import agency, will get the tea packed at
the Sochi plant. India has traditionally been dependent on the former Soviet
Union for its tea exports.
Last year the Soviet Union took 109.6m kg of India's total tea export of
203.57m kg, but there is uncertainty about India's tea exports following the
disintegration of the Soviet Union.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Salinas sows seeds for economic
benefits/ A look at the impact of Mexico's far-reaching agricultural reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S president, Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari, likes to propose bold,
sweeping reforms. But many Mexican government officials reckon the president
has launched his boldest and most radical yet in opening up Mexico's
antiquated agricultural sector to market forces.
His reforms, which passed into law last week, will greatly extend private
ownership of Mexican farms and increase the attraction of agricultural
investment for both Mexican and foreign business.
They will also remove the government's powers of distributing agricultural
land and undermine the rural power base which has kept the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in power for the past 62 years.
At the same time they have exposed Mr Salinas's government to the criticism
that it has betrayed the spirit of Mexico's 1910-17 revolution -
encapsulated by the constitutional right every Mexican had to land.
For Mexico's president, however, the risk is worth taking. The country's
inefficient agricultural system, which has suffered from a lack of capital
and declining farm size, is standing in the way of his attempts to modernise
the country's economy.
Mexico's farm sector accounts for 30 per cent of the population but just 8
per cent of GDP. The World Bank has recently estimated that 11m of the 27m
Mexicans based in the countryside live in extreme poverty and says that
'lagging rural and agricultural development' lies at the root of the
problem.
The weakness of the rural sector is largely the result of the agricultural
laws enacted after Mexico's bloody 1910-17 revolution. These laws gave every
Mexican the right to land, and established a system of ejido or communal
farms - where farmers managed their plots of state-owned land but often
shared capital and equipment. Ejido farms now account for about half of
Mexican farms.
The ejido system, and the concomitant commitment to land reform, has
provided land for millions of Mexicans. But it discouraged private
investment in agriculture and the creation of larger, more efficient farms.
Ejido farmers, (ejidatarios) could not sell, rent or mortgage their land,
and thus faced difficulty in raising credit. Many private farmers, unsure if
their land will be taken away from them, were also unable or unwilling to
borrow money.
Under the reforms, the constitional right to land has been scrapped.
Mexico's 3m ejido farmers will for the first time become landowners (rather
than landusers) and, as ejidos, they will also be able to form joint
ventures with both Mexican and foreign agricultural businesses without legal
restrictions.
If they prefer, they can become individual private property owners. At the
same time, private sector farmers who combine to form limited companies will
be able to farm up to 2,500 hectares of irrigated land. Previously they
could only farm up to 100 hectares.
The government hopes that the reforms, and the more secure property rights
they create, will attract new investment in capital and technology. This, it
believes, will raise productivity, increase wages and reduce poverty in the
rural sector.
There are signs that the hoped-for investment will be forthcoming. Grupo
Pulsar, Mexico's largest tobacco group, is planning considerable investment
in agro-industry, according to Mario Rodriguez, director of banking affairs.
'The major factor is the credibility that the changes in the constitution
give private investors,' says Mr Rodriguez.
Other Mexican companies have planned similar joint ventures, building on the
100 or so that had overcome legal obstacles, and are already in place.
Foreign agricultural companies are also changing their attitudes towards
investing in Mexican agriculture.
'In the past, many people did not bother to make fixed capital investments'
says Mr Ken Foster of AmFin, a consultancy company specialising in
agro-industry. He says that lack of capital and legal uncertainties made it
difficult to enforce contracts and were a disincentive to foreign
businesses.
Mr Foster forecasts big demand in investments in labour-intensive crops
(vegetables) and winter crops, such as citrus fruits.
But transforming Mexico's rural sector will take time and, for certain
sectors, the adjustment will be painful. Most of Mexico's desperately poor
2.3m maize farmers will not benefit in the short term. They are unlikely to
find buyers for their poor unirrigated land, unsuitable for fruits or
vegetables.
Moreover, the conclusion of a free trade agreement with the US would spell
serious difficulties for maize farmers. Mexican maize prices are about 70
per cent higher than in international markets.
To reduce the impact, the government has promised a phased liberalisation of
the maize market and is also planning a large infrastructure programme to
raise agricultural productivity and increase irrigation.
The government hopes that an ambitious programme of public investment in
irrigation will complement private investment in value-added crops. Mexico
will gradually import more maize, paid for out of crash crops.
The government's policy of agricultural reform will also bring broader
political risks. In particular, it will reduce the ability of the ruling
party to control the rural vote.
Under the ejido system the PRI could buy support by handing out and taking
away land according to political necessity. Land disputes were settled by
the agrarian reform ministry, which in Mexico meant the PRI.
The task of overseeing the agricultural changes will therefore test
President Salinas's political skills to the full. But the betting in Mexico
is that Mr Salinas will get away with the agricultural changes - as he has
done with all his other gambles to date.
The PRI's convincing win in last year's mid-term elections showed that it
can attract the urban lower and middle class vote. The conservative
opposition party has for some time called for many of the changes now
proposed by the president.
Above all, recent privatisations and buoyant tax revenues have given the
president a war chest of billions of dollars to provide agricultural
irrigation and ease the pain of change.

Zinc prices fell away from three-month highs on the LME on profit taking
following news that the force majeure at Peru's Cajarmarquilla refinery is
to be lifted next week. The market had entered an area of stiff historic
resistance between Dollars 1,220 and Dollars 1,230 a tonne for three-month
metal, which closed at Dollars 1209, up Dollars 11 on the day. In addition
to recent production stoppages, the market is being supported by tightness
of May delivery metal, dealers said. Three-month aluminium repeatedly failed
to erode resistance at Dollars 1,320 a tonne and closed at the day's lows on
merchant selling and long liquidation. Another rise in LME warehouse stocks
is likely today following fresh arrivals of metal in Europe from the CIS.
Nickel was mostly higher on short covering following Wednesday's bounce from
important support at the eight-week low of Dollars 7,400 a tonne. Nymex
platinum futures were higher at midday after a buying spree by locals
triggered some buy-stop orders. New York arabica coffee prices were lower at
midsession but May was holding above support at 68.20 cents per lb. Dealers
said the market was continuing to monitor discussions about price support
measures among producers in advance of ICO talks next month.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BARBADOS Stock Ex-change is launching an unlisted securities market to
assist small companies which are highly geared and in need of capital,
writes Canute James in Kingston.
The requirements for admission to the new market will be less demanding than
those for the main market, according to Mr Anthony Johnson, general manager
of the exchange.
'In the circumstances confronting the Barbadian economy, it is obvious that
many small, innovative business enterprises with growth potential are either
undercapitalised, too highly geared or simply find avenues to raising
capital inaccessible,' Mr Johnson said.
'Such corporate entities should find the unlisted securities market an open
door to marketability and enhanced liquidity of capital issues, thus
preparing the way for advancement to the official list,' he added.
To qualify for admission on the new market, companies must have performed
well for at least two consecutive years, and have a minimum equity of
BDollars 200,000 (USDollars 100,000).

FT  06 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Commercial Union issue declined by many
firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL Union, the UK insurance company, yesterday stirred controversy in
the international bond market, launching a Pounds 100m issue in which
leading sterling underwriting firms declined to participate.
The deal was lead managed by Kleinwort Benson. It was the firm's first
lead-management role in the mainstream of the Eurosterling bond market since
August 1989.
The 10 3/4 per cent bonds were priced to yield 110 basis points more than UK
government bonds of a comparable maturity, seen by many underwriting firms
as insufficient to attract investors. Syndicate officials at rival firms
said that a yield spread of 120 to 125 basis points was necessary to sell
the bonds.
In addition, the government bond market continued to trade lower yesterday
following a full-point drop in prices on Wednesday. The benchmark 10-year
gilt closed the day on a yield of 9.52 per cent, from 9.37 per cent
Wednesday morning.
As a result of these factors, many established sterling bond houses declined
to participate in the deal. Cazenove, the stockbroker which also acts as
broker for Commercial Union, agreed to be co-lead manager to the deal. Other
participants were Commerzbank, DG Bank, Hoare Govett and Morgan Stanley.
The lead manager, which underwrote around 75 per cent of the issue, said
that it found demand from a number of UK institutional investors.
Although Commercial Union has not been hit by the property-related insurance
claims which have damaged many of its rivals, all UK insurers are under
financial pressure. This has discouraged overseas investors from buying
insurance company bonds.
At the close of trading, the lead manager said that the bonds were trading
at 98 5/8 bid, having been re-offered to investors at a fixed price of
99.236. At this level the yield spread was 115 basis points more than UK
government bonds.
Elsewhere, activity was muted with no borrowers willing to launch large new
issues ahead of US employment data released today. British Gas launched a
Ecu200m two-year deal, lead managed by Swiss Bank Corporation and targetted
at retail investors.
Banco Rio de la Plata, one of Argentina's top banks, launched its
anticipated Dollars 100m three-year issue, lead managed by Merrill Lynch.
Participants reported firm demand for the 9 1/8 per cent bonds, which were
priced to yield 350 basis points more than US Treasury paper.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEXICAN government's plan to finance new highways through the sale of
toll concessions is creating the country's first revenue bond market,
Bloomberg reports from Mexico City.
International investors may find the new securities - bonds backed by the
revenue generated by toll roads - attractive, said Mr Javier Magana, a
director of Probursa, a Mexican brokerage.
'If there's a growth area in Mexico it will be infrastructure,' Mr Magana
said. 'It could be an interesting way for foreign investors to diversify
their Mexican holdings.'
Mexico, which had 2,500km of roads when President Salinas took office in
1989, has said it hopes to build another 3,500km for Dollars 10bn during the
president's six-year term.
The government wants to finance road construction by awarding toll
concessions to private companies, or by selling existing roads and using the
revenues to construct new highways in less-developed areas of the country.
Yields on the highway bonds can be attractive. The eight-year bonds for the
Manzanillo-Armeria highway that mature in November 1999, guarantee investors
20 per cent or 300 basis points over the highest yielding short-term
Treasury bill, currently 14.1 per cent, whichever is greater.

FT  06 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Buying into Mexico's new
elite / A report on the privatisation of the nation's banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Sunday night, a group of Mexican investors led by Mr Eduardo Creel, a
former broker who made his fortune in Mexico's money markets, won a
privatisation auction with an astonishing bid of Dollars 846m, or 29 times
last year's earnings.
This was for a medium-sized Mexican bank that has been beset by bad loans
and which many outside Mr Creel's group of investors doubt will thrive.
While 29 times earnings was the highest multiple paid yet in the Mexican
bank privatisation programme, few in Mexico seemed surprised, for the
financial community has become accustomed to such elevated prices. Bancreser
fetched 50 times earnings, but only because profits for the year were
abnormally low.
In the past nine months, the government has sold 12 banks in competitive
auctions for 30.75bn pesos (Dollars 10bn), at an average of 21 times
historic earnings.
Worldwide, a privatised bank is generally valued at around 14 times
earnings, according to First Boston, the investment bank advising Mexico on
the privatisations.
The newly formed financial groups, comprising privatised banks and
brokerages, are now among the biggest groups in the world by market value.
As critics point out, these groups are in effect controlled by just a few
thousand wealthy Mexican investors. Banamex-Accival - the holding company
comprising Banamex, Mexico's largest bank, and the brokerage house Accival -
is worth around Dollars 7.7bn, compared with Dollars 5.84bn for Citicorp.
The government is in the enviable position of being chastised for selling
the banks for too much. Mr Mario Rodriguez, director of banking at Grupo
Pulsar, a large conglomerate, warns: 'No one in their right mind would pay
3.7 times book value and expect their money back in under 75 years.'
Pulsar is waiting for the second round, when it hopes to pick up a bank
cheaply.
Many Mexicans say the government is in fact selling power, or status, to
which money is no object. As Mr Rodriguez says: 'The new bankers are buying
membership to a very distinguished club.'
Another Mexican broker put it differently: 'We have no nobility and this is
the closest thing. It is the search for permanence in an impermanent world.'
The Mexican banks, unlike the money chasing them, date back to the 19th
century. They were nationalised in 1982 by Mr Jose Lopez Portillo, who was
then president.
The banks' buyers are quick to point out more prosaic reasons for the high
prices. They note that in the past, Mexico's financial sector has grown
twice as fast as the economy.
Given the rosy forecasts of average economic growth of 5 per cent over the
next decade, bank earnings should increase by 10 per cent over the same
period. Furthermore, Mexican banks are generally inefficient, use outdated
technology and are overmanned. This, they say, shows that there is room to
cut costs.
Mr Guillermo Ortiz, the Mexican government minister who has masterminded the
bank sales, stoutly defends the prices paid. Mexico, he says, is relatively
under-banked.
He foresees 'a very lucrative market in consumer credit and small businesses
in the future', especially since the government has recently eliminated the
liquidity coefficient (akin to a reserve requirement) on bank lending.
Such arguments persuaded Baring Research, the Mexico branch of the brokerage
Baring Securities, to recommend Banamex-Accival (Banacci), Mexico's largest
financial group, for a 'long-term buy', and forecast average annual growth
of earnings of 12.3 per cent over the decade.
Nevertheless, Barings highlights considerable risks. As the brokerage says:
'This favourable sectoral outlook is clouded by the uncertain outcome of
Mexico's big bang, involving several simultaneous changes in the financial
sector - deregulation, privatisation, broker-bank mergers into financial
groups, and entry of foreign institutions.'
The deregulation of Mexico's financial sector, and the imminent arrival of
foreign banks with the likely passage of the North American free trade
agreement, is likely to introduce considerably more competition, and cut
profit margins. Currently, the spread between borrowing and lending is
around 6 per cent, about twice that in western Europe.
Foreigners are likely to team up with Mexico's stronger banks, leaving the
weaker ones even more vulnerable.
This week Bancomer, the second largest bank, launches the road show for an
international public offering for Dollars 500m, to be shortly followed by a
similar offering by Banamex.
Last week, Banamex formed a joint venture with American Express to provide
financial services in Mexico.
In the fight for the share of the retail market, Mexico's large banks - even
without foreign help - will be at an advantage relative to the medium and
small ones, since their average costs tend to be lower.
As one US bank analyst remarks: 'It's one thing to pay 12 to 14 earnings for
30 per cent market share (for example, Banamex). But paying 20 to 25
earnings for a 3 to 5 per cent market share, without a distinct market
niche: how do you justify that?'
But at this late stage, with just six banks left on the block, passion may
have overtaken reason. The last two banks have gone for record sums, as
competition between frustrated investors has heated up. Many of those still
without banks have promised to carry on bidding high until they win.
The government likes to say the sure winners are Mexico's taxpayers, who
will finally get hold of some of the money hoarded by Mexico's super-rich.
But the strategy is not without its risks.
Financial power has been handed over to a small group of people who already
control much of Mexico's wealth.

FT  06 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: SEC gives go-ahead to
'incubator' exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Exchange Commission, the US watchdog, yesterday gave the
go-ahead to the American Stock Exchange's (ASE) plan to create a new
'incubator' stock market for small companies.
The SEC's approval means that the ASE can launch its Emerging Company
Marketplace (ECM) as planned on March 18. It will list companies with a
market value of less than Dollars 2.5m which are too small to meet the
exchange's regular listing standards.
The ECM will compete directly with the Nasdaq over-the-counter market run by
the National Association of Securities Dealers. The Nasdaq has traditionally
been regarded as the first home for small and start-up companies.
The ASE hopes that between 15 and 20 stocks will be listed on the ECM for
opening day. All the newly listed stocks will be subject to normal
regulatory requirements such as last sale reporting, trading and marketmaker
allocation rules, and surveillance procedures.
The new companies, however, will be exempt from the ASE's rules mandating
independent directors, audit committees, shareholder quorums and common
stock voting rights.
The ASE is setting up the new market to make it easier for very small
companies to raise funds through equity issues. At the moment, newly created
and small companies are finding it difficult to borrow money because US
banks have tightened their credit standards in the recessionary business
climate.
The SEC has already this year proposed changes to make it easier for small
companies to raise money on the capital markets. Those proposals included:
allowing small companies to issue up to Dollars 1m in unrestricted
securities and canvas the public directly for investor interest; widening
eligibility to use a simplified disclosure document for share offerings; and
allowing small companies to file 'junior' quarterly and year-end reports.

mergers'
</HEADLINE>

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY may intervene to force the much-needed restructuring of its troubled
banking system, Mr Tormod Hermansen, the chairman of the state-backed Bank
Insurance Fund (BIF) warned yesterday.
Mr Hermansen said the state would implement a bank restructuring, including
mergers, if the banks do not show signs of stabilising their finances and
returning to profitability during 1993.
The BIF was established last year and since then has seen NKr11bn in state
cash go to Den norske Bank, Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, Norway's top
three banks. Under the state's rescue programme it became the sole owner of
Christiania and Fokus and majority owner of DnB.
Mr Hermansen said the state did not want to keep its shareholdings in the
banks any longer than necessary but that it may take three to four years
before the banks make sufficient earnings to service their equity capital on
a stable basis.
Christiania warned on Wednesday that it needed at least NKr2.5bn in fresh
state funding to meet new capital adequacy requirements. Fokus Bank has also
said it needed additional cash.
Mr Hermansen said that Christiania would get sufficient state funding to
allow it to operate within legal requirements.
Earlier this week the government warned the banks to do more to improve
earnings and efficiency and cut costs.
To this end, Christiania and Fokus said they would raise interest rates on
loans and increase fees for services and products.
DnB said that it was not planning to raise interest rates but would increase
fees.

FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: Anglovaal earnings advance 6%
midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASED earnings from Anglovaal Industries (AVI) allowed the Anglovaal
group, one of South Africa's large mining houses, to record a 6 per cent
increase in earnings in the six months to the end of December.
Although turnover rose by 7 per cent to R4.1bn (Dollars 1.44bn) compared
with the 1990 interim figure, recessionary economic conditions took their
toll with operating profit down by 5 per cent to R376.1m.
Attributable earnings, however, benefited from a 42 per cent increase in
investment income, to R22.5m, and a 17 per cent increase in equity accounted
earnings, to R45.7m, to end higher at R143.1m.
Anglovaal also announced yesterday that it would, through AVI, be lifting
its investment in cement producer Anglo-Alpha to 19.5 per cent.
Under the deal, which involves a restructuring of the interests of the
Anglovaal group and Holderbank Financiere Glaris in Anglo-Alpha, AVI will
acquire Anglovaal's 8.1 per cent direct interest in Anglo-Alpha.
Additionally, the direct interests of AVI and Holderbank in Anglo-Alpha will
be injected into an intermediate holding company, Altur.
AVI will then acquire from Holderbank a portion of its interest in Altur,
equivalent to an effective 11.4 per cent interest in Anglo-Alpha.
Altur will hold 54.8 per cent of Anglo-Alpha's equity, and in terms of a
proposed offer to Altur minorities - who have a 5.5 per cent effective
holding in Anglo-Alpha - Anglovaal's indirect holding could increase to 25
per cent. The aggregate purchase price of R249.1m will be paid for by the
issue of 1.92m ordinary shares in AVI.
Mr Basil Hersov, Anglovaal chairman, noted that while AVI's earnings had
increased by 18 per cent, income from mining investments had been flat
compared with 1990. Interest income declined as rates softened and surplus
funds were used for purchases and to follow rights in the recent AVI offer.
Earnings per share rose by 6 per cent to 240 cents and the interim dividend
is being lifted by 10 per cent to 33 cents a share. Mr Hersov said group
earnings would remain under pressure for the balance of the financial year.

FAISAL Islamic Bank of Bahrain, one of the island's two offshore Islamic

USDollars 9.02m, Reuter reports from Manama.
The bank, which is a subsidiary of the Bahamas-based Dar al-Mal al-Islami
group, said income after paying profits on customers' investments jumped to
Dollars 26.5m from Dollars 17.7m in 1990.
The entire profit was transferred to reserves to help strengthen the bank's
capital base. Paid-in capital was increased to Dollars 50m from Dollars 40m
last year. The bank also approved plans to double its authorised capital to
Dollars 100m.
Assets grew to Dollars 1.3bn from Dollars 1.1bn in 1990.
Faisal Islamic Bank sold 40 per cent of its shares through private placement
to Saudi investors during 1991, leaving Dar al-Mal with a 60 per cent stake.

decline
</HEADLINE>

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRIERLEY Investments (BIL), the New Zealand investment and trading group,
yesterday reported a 48 per cent fall in net profits to NZDollars 90.48m
(USDollars 49.4m) in the first half to December from NZDollars 175.18m a
year earlier.
However, Mr Paul Collins, chief executive, said the group was at a 'turning
point' and more confident about its future than at any time in the past four
years.
During the period the company's debt fell to under NZDollars 1bn from
NZDollars 4bn as a result of sales of long-term assets such as Tozer Kemsley
and Millbourn, the UK car dealership, to Inchcape.
He said that BIL, most of whose assets were in the UK, was 'through the
worst' with its investments in such companies as Mount Charlotte, the UK
hotel group, and its 23 per cent stake in Budgen, the UK supermarket group.
Its other UK investments in United Scientific and GPG were doing well.
Most of its New Zealand investments were performing much more strongly, and
some of these investments could be partially refloated to take advantage of
revitalised interest in equities.
Mr Collins said that earnings for the restructured group were more
comparable with the NZDollars 36.54m earned in the second half of last year.
The result included an exceptional loss of NZDollars 21m on its investment
in Magnum Corporation, the New Zealand based liquor group. BIL was committed
to seeing a profit turnround in Magnum.
However, BIL also announced an unexpected 'exceptional' loss of NZDollars
17m after writing down 4 cents a share to 6 cents on its shareholding in
property group Ariadne, due to the protracted downturn in the sector in
Australia.
Mr Collins said that the improvements in earnings of subsidiaries came from
a reduction in loss-making operations, increased efficiencies, a lower cost
base and more competitive exchange and interest rates rather than increased
sales. BIL was now well positioned to benefit from any upturn in domestic
activity through a much higher conversion rate to profit.
Benefits of restructuring Air New Zealand, its 42 per cent owned associate
were readily apparent with a half-year profit of NZDollars 56m.
Mr Collins defended the sale of Tozer for Pounds 393.5m (Dollars 692.56m)
following payment of dividend and other agreed payments to Inchcape. He said
a Pounds 46m profit was achieved, and there were few other possible buyers
apart from Lonrho, which was unacceptable to the Japanese motor companies.
Mount Charlotte Hotels, the largest hotelier in London, produced a full-year
profit of Pounds 1.5m compared with Pounds 29.1m. 'While the result is
disappointing it represents an exceptional achievement in the most difficult
year in the UK hotel industry since 1960,' Mr Collins said. The trading
profit of Pounds 72.6m, down from Pounds 99.3m, was 'streets ahead of its
competitors', representing a 32 per cent return on sales. He said forward
orders for the summer and autumn periods were well ahead of 1991.
It was a reflection of the value of other assets that BIL would absorb a
NZDollars 180m interest cost on holding Mount Charlotte and still achieve an
increased profit in 1991-92.
The directors are increasing the interim dividend to 8 cents a share from 4
cents.

<TEXT>
AN ABNORMAL profit from the sale of a UK-based financing company saved
Goodman Fielder Wattie, Australia's biggest food group, from a fall in
earnings for the first half to Decem-ber.
The company yesterday declared a 14.8 per cent rise in earnings to ADollars
77.0m (USDollars 57.80m) from ADollars 67.1m on an advance in sales to
ADollars 2.25bn from ADollars 2.16bn.
The interim dividend is being held at 5 cents a share.
However, the result masked a deterioration in the company's continuing
businesses, reflecting the recession in the Australian economy.
Operating profits fell by 9.5 per cent to ADollars 82.8m before an ADollars
22.1m abnormal profit, compared with ADollars 4.9m, resulting mainly from
the sale of Benford, an inter-company financing vehicle used in Goodman's
abortive 1989 raid on Britain's Ranks Hovis McDougall.
The Benford sale was announced earlier this year; however, details of the
transaction remain obscure.
Mr Michael Nugent, chief executive, described the result as disappointing
but in line with his prediction at last year's annual meeting.
'The directors believe that trading conditions will continue to be extremely
difficult and that it is unlikely there will be a recovery in consumer
demand of any substance in the current financial year,' he said.
'The directors believe that a modest improvement in operating profit before
tax and abnormal items should be achieveable for the full year.'
Only two of the company's six main operating divisions achieved increased
pre-tax earnings in the half - European Foods and Ingredients.
The baking and milling, poultry, grocery and frozen food divisions sustained
earnings falls of between 5 per cent and 35 per cent.
The result followed a tax credit of ADollars 2.9m compared with a ADollars
31.8m charge.
Interest costs eased to ADollars 69.2m from ADollars 75.7m.

BRIDGE OIL, the Sydney-based resources group, returned to the black in 1991,
shrugging off the previous year's big write-down of the troubled Aredor
diamond venture in West Africa.
The company turned a ADollars 81.3m net loss into a ADollars 28.7m
(USDollars 21.50m) net profit in the year, and is resuming its dividend with
a 2 cents a share payout.
The result was achieved despite a 4 per cent fall in sales to ADollars
195.8m from ADollars 204.6m. The directors said 60 per cent of the company's
revenue was now derived from the US and the decline reflected lower US gas
prices.
'During the year, the company substantially replaced Australian production
with new reserves,' they said. '(The company) anticipates achieving the same
result in the current financial year notwithstanding the continued high
production.
'There remains a degree of uncertainty as regards product prices. The
present level of product prices in real terms is approximately equal to
those ruling in 1974.
'Average product prices are presently below what was achieved in the
previous year, and therefore unless there is an improvement, the result
achieved in the 1991 year will be difficult to maintain.'
Directors said the Aredor diamond project has achieved a positive cash flow,
but incurred losses of ADollars 1.5m.
Bridge paid back borrowings of ADollars 52m in the year, cutting net
interest-bearing debt to ADollars 218m. This helped to reduce interest
expenses to ADollars 23.5m from ADollars 29.3m.

PHILIPPINE Long Distance Telephone (PLDT), the country's leading

announced 1991 net profits of 4.72bn pesos (Dollars 187m), an increase of 48

However, the profits growth rate was somewhat slower than last year's 55 per

Attributable profits, after deducting dividends due to preferred
shareholders, grew by 52 per cent to 4.5bn pesos. Earnings per share
amounted to 98.90 pesos, up from 64.56 pesos.
Operating revenues rose 29 per cent to 16.6bn pesos due mainly to 'the
installation of more telephones, higher volume of long-distance calls, and
various improvements in the company's service capabilities'.
The company reinvested 95 per cent of its 1991 net profits, effectively
increasing stockholders' equity to 17.47bn pesos.

<TEXT>
IMPROVED lending margins helped Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce post an
11 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings, in spite of a rise in loan loss
provisions.
Canada's second biggest bank lifted earnings to CDollars 221m, (USDollars
187.2m) or CDollars 1.01 per share, in the three months to January 31, from
CDollars 199m, or 98 cents a share, a year earlier. Return on common equity
fell to 13.5 per cent from 14.2 per cent as a result of a large increase in
preferred share financing. Return on average assets improved to 0.71 per
cent from 0.67 per cent.
Net interest income rose to CDollars 922m from CDollars 818m, reflecting a
widening in interest rate margins to 3.05 per cent from 2.8 per cent.
The protracted domestic recession has led the bank to raise loan loss
provisions to CDollars 188m from CDollars 128m. CIBC said it estimated loan
losses for the year at CDollars 750m, compared with CDollars 613m in fiscal
1991.
Non-performing loans totalled CDollars 2.1bn, up from CDollars 1.9bn three
months earlier. Most of the increase was outside Canada.
CIBC is the last of Canada's big six banks to report first-quarter earnings.
In most cases, lower interest rates have offset higher loan losses to
produce an improved bottom line. The Canadian banks continue to boast strong
capital positions and relatively attractive returns compared to many of
their US counterparts.
The strongest first-quarter performance came from Bank of Nova Scotia, which
lifted net earnings by 24 per cent.
Toronto-Dominion Bank, which was the most highly-regarded Canadian bank
throughout the 1980s, has been hit by its heavy exposure to Ontario and
Quebec, and by a number of soured international ventures. TD's first-quarter
earnings dipped by 9 per cent.

NATIONAL Semiconductor reported sharply higher earnings for its third
quarter, ended February 23, helped by a pre-tax gain of Dollars 8.5m from
patent licensing fees.
The US company reported net earnings of Dollars 14.5m, or 11 cents per
share, against net earnings of Dollars 5m, or 2 cents, in the same quarter a
year ago which included a restructuring credit of Dollars 21.1m from the
sale of a production facility.
Sales for the quarter were Dollars 401.8m, up from Dollars 386.8m last year.
'We have achieved our announced goal of improving operating profit by
reducing the break-even point to below Dollars 400m per quarter by the third
quarter,' said Mr Gilbert Amelio, National Semiconductor president and chief
executive. 'Profits from operations improved over the previous quarter and
the comparable quarter a year ago, even though the third quarter
traditionally shows the greatest seasonal weakness each year.'
For the nine months, National Semiconductor reported a net loss of Dollars
147.6m or Dollars 1.49, including a first-quarter restructuring charge of
Dollars 149.3m in connection with its plans to consolidate worldwide
manufacturing operations. Last year, the group recorded a net loss of
Dollars 157m or Dollars 1.59. The 1991 results also included a restructuring
charge of Dollars 120.1m.
Sales for the first nine months were Dollars 1.23bn, down slightly from
Dollars 1.26bn last time.
During the third quarter National Semiconductor announced a Dollars 120m
expansion of its Arlington, Texas, manufacturing facility. 'This is our
first focused major investment in accordance with our restructuring plan,'
Mr Amelio said.
National Semiconductor remains cautious about the current quarter.

THE controversy over the safety of Halcion, the sleeping pill alleged to
have harmful side-effects, was among the main concerns that led to the
downgrading of the long-term debt rating of Upjohn, the US drugs company, by
Moody's Investor Service.
The rating agency said that sales of Halcion were 'falling sharply due to
adverse publicity and regulatory actions'.
Moody's noted that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had recently said
its data supports Halcion's effectiveness, but stressed that deeper
investigation by the FDA and other regulators 'could result in additional
restrictions on Halcion or all drugs of its class'.
Moody's lowered the rating to Double-A3 from Double-A2. About Dollars 520m
of debt is affected. Upjohn has denied that it failed to disclose the
side-effects of Halcion to the FDA and has launched a lawsuit against Dr Ian
Oswald, a Scottish psychiatry professor and critic of Halcion.
Aside from concern about Halcion, which has Dollars 260m of annual sales and
is Upjohn's second biggest drug product, Moody's noted that Upjohn's
marketing exclusivity in the US for Xanax tranquilliser, Ansaid
anti-inflammatory agent and Halcion expires in 1993. Moody's said these
represented a significant portion of Upjohn's pharmaceuticals earnings,
which could fall when the exclusivity ends next year.

FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: IBM senior debt is downgraded by
Moody's
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, for decades the most blue chip of all US
manufacturing companies, has suffered the indignity of having its long-term
debt downgraded by Moody's Investors Service, a leading credit rating
agency.
Moody's cut its senior debt rating from Aaa to Aa2, because its 'credit
quality over the longer term will be adversely affected by shifting customer
requirements and intense competitive pressures'. The blow is likely to be
more psychological than practical since the company's rating is still high
and Moody's stressed that 'IBM remains an exceptionally strong credit'.
Analysts said it was a further sign that IBM, which dominated the global
computer industry, was a diminished force facing pressures from smaller and
nimbler rivals - which it is emulating through a management shake-up and
decentralisation.
The first downgrading of IBM's debt occurred last year at the hands of Duff
&amp; Phelps, another rating agency. S &amp; P retains its top rating on IBM - AAA -
but has had the company on 'negative outlook' since last August. It has said
that a downgrade would be possible if IBM failed to improve profits when it
shipped its new line of mainframe computers, a process which began in late
1990.
IBM said it was disappointed with Moody's action but believed the impact on
its worldwide financing requirements would be minimal.
The company said that in seven of the 10 years from 1980 to 1990 it had been
the most profitable company among the Fortune 500. Although 1991 had been a
difficult year, it had earned pre-tax profits of nearly Dollars 4bn.
Moody's said 'IBM's competitive environment, and its own necessary remedial
actions to adapt to it, will continue to induce volatility in its operating
performance, and that overall returns and margins will stabilise at lower
levels than those IBM has historically reported'.

deficit

<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of
SKr1.2bn (Dollars 198m) for 1991, the second straight year it has suffered a
deficit following its loss of SKr763m in 1990.
The loss reflected extraordinary costs associated with a restructuring
programme as well as a write-off of its involvement in the Inter-Continental
hotel chain. SAS made a small operating loss of SKr9m before extraordinary
costs against a profit of SKr38m in 1990.
But Mr Jan Carlzon, SAS president, expressed confidence that SAS could
return to profitability this year if it succeeds with its cost-cutting
programme, which includes eliminating 3,500 jobs by this summer.
The carrier confirmed it had reached a preliminary agreement to sell back
its 40 per cent stake in Inter-Continental to the hotel chain's controlling
shareholder, Saison Holding, part of the Japanese retail and leisure group.
Mr Carlzon said the airline has lost between SKr1.5bn and SKr2bn from its
unsuccessful attempt to expand its hotel operations after it purchased the
stake in Inter-Continental from Saison in 1989 for Dollars 500m.
The hotel venture was part of Mr Carlzon's strategy during the 1980s to
transform SAS into a complete travel company. But the SAS president decided
last year to concentrate on airline operations as passenger traffic dropped
in response to the Gulf War and the recession.
However, SAS will acquire principal ownership of three European hotels from
Inter-Continental, including the Portman in London, the Dusseldorf
Inter-Continental and Cologne Inter-Continental, which will be added to
SAS's own hotel chain.
The write-off of its shares in Inter-Continental as well as the bankrupt US
carrier Continental Airlines amounted to SKr1.2bn, which helped increase
one-time restructuring and extraordinary expenses for SAS to SKr1.9bn.

<TEXT>
UNIGRO, the Dutch groceries retailer and wholesaler, said yesterday that it
intends to acquire the Spanish supermarket group Grelar Asturias from Banco
de Bilbao y Vizcaya, marking its third acquisition of a stores group in
Spain since 1989. Financial terms were not disclosed.
Grelar Asturias, with annual sales equivalent to Fl 270m (Dollars 150m),
operates 73 supermarkets under the El Arbol name in northwest Spain.
Unigro's two previous Spanish acquisitions - the Sagara group in 1989 and
Penagrande in 1991 - are also located in the Asturias, Cantabria and
Castilla Leon regions of Spain.
The latest acquisition will lift Unigro's Spanish turnover to roughly Fl
900m and give it a market share in north-west Spain of around 15 per cent.
Unigro, which operates supermarkets in the Netherlands under the names Spar
and Super, is also active in Belgium, where it generates annual turnover of
Fl 900m. It had total turnover of Fl 3bn in 1990-1991.
Wessanen, the Dutch foods group best known for its range of cheeses, reports
net profits up by 20 per cent at Fl 105.6m for 1991 following a 5 per cent
increase in turnover to Fl 3.9bn.
The company said all divisions contributed to the improved result.

VOLKSWAGEN of Germany, the leading European car maker, is increasing its
production capacity in Mexico by more than 60 per cent. Mr Carl Hahn,
chairman of the VW management board, said that the capacity of the group's
Mexican subsidiary would be increased to 390,000 from 240,000 cars a year by
1994.
VW is making Mexico its sole production source for the supply of its Golf
range of small family cars to the north American market. Mr Hahn said the
group was seeking to make the supply of Golf cars to the US independent of
exchange rate fluctuations between the D-Mark and the US dollar.
In the first two months of the year the VW group increased its sales of
Volkswagen, Audi, SEAT and Skoda vehicles by 6 per cent to 558,000, said Mr
Hahn. Vehicle sales in Europe also rose by 6 per cent to 413,000. New orders
for VW and Audi cars were at a record level at the end of February, he said.
VW is developing its distribution co-operation with Toyota in Japan, where
47 Toyota dealers have recently agreed to begin selling VW and Audi cars in
Japan.

FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: PolyGram climbs 24.8% to Fl 446m
in tough year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLYGRAM, the music company which is 80 per cent owned by Philips of the
Netherlands, shrugged off the economic downturn in several of its markets to
record a 24.8 per cent increase in net income last year to Fl 446m (Dollars
237m).
The company, which has 20 per cent of its shares listed on the Amsterdam and
New York stock exchanges, benefited from an improved performance in North
America and several popular and classical hits.
North American operating income was Fl 13m last year, compared to a loss of
Fl 48m in 1990. Six of the company's popular albums sold over 3m units each
worldwide last year, compared to two albums in 1990. Top-selling artists in
1991 included Sting, Dire Straits, U2 and Bryan Adams.
Best-selling classical albums included 'Carreras, Domingo, Pavarotti in
Concert' which was recorded in 1990 during the football World Cup in Rome
and has now sold 7m units. PolyGram has also sold 1m copies of the concert
video.
Worldwide sales were up 20.5 per cent to Fl 6.3bn. Net income per share rose
24.8 per cent to Fl 2.62. The full year dividend is Fl 0.60 (Fl 0.50).
Mr Alain Levy, chief executive, said the company last year increased its
share of the worldwide recorded music market from 17.5 to 18.5 per cent.
Sales of compact discs continued to grow at the expense of other music
formats such as cassettes and long-playing records. CDs accounted for 58 per
cent of PolyGram unit sales last year, compared to 48 per cent in 1990.
Cassettes made up 35 per cent of unit sales last year, with vinyl records
accounting for only 7 per cent. The higher price of compact discs meant that
CD sales were 71 per cent of album sales by value, compared to 62 per cent
in 1990. Cassettes made up 23 per cent of sales and vinyl records 6 per
cent.
Mr Levy said, however, that with the increasing number of households owning
compact disc players, CD sales growth would probably begin to slow. But he
added that the introduction of the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) this year
would provide a boost to the music market. DCC tapes look similar to
conventional cassettes but have a sound quality similar to that of CDs.
Mr Jan Cook, chief financial officer, said Mr Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really
Useful Holdings had made a positive contribution to PolyGram's profits.

FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: Siemens Nixdorf lifts turnover
26%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SIEMENS Nixdorf, the loss-making computer subsidiary of the German
electrical and electronics group, boosted sales by 26 per cent in the first
four months of the current financial year to DM3.8bn (Dollars 2.3bn),
according to the chairman, Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig.
Orders were up 14 per cent on the same period of the previous year, at
DM3.7bn, he told the annual general meeting in Paderborn. If this growth
rate could be maintained to the end of the year (September 30), then Siemens
Nixdorf could expect a significant improvement in its results, he said.
However, the subsidiary, rescued by the Siemens group from collapse in 1990,
will still be in the red, thanks to the fierce price competition between
computer manufacturers, he said. Price cuts would cost the company some
DM800m.
In the 1990-1991 financial year, the first year after the takeover, Siemens
Nixdorf posted a loss of DM780m, and turnover fell by 2 per cent to
DM12.1bn.
Bilfinger &amp; Berger, the construction group, says all divisions at home and
abroad contributed to improve profits in 1991, although it gave no actual
figures. It said it planned a dividend in line with profit development. For
1990 Bilfinger posted 1990 a net profit of DM43.5m.

<TEXT>
PREUSSAG, the German steel, trading, energy and metals group, which took
over the Salzgitter state steel company at the end of 1989, continues to
confound the sceptics and report 'satisfactory' prospects for the current
year.
The company intends to maintain its 1990-1991 dividend of DM10 per share
this year, in spite of a downturn in sales of some 7 per cent in the first
four months, said Mr Ernst Pieper, chairman.
Group net profit in the last financial year, to September 30, reached DM425m
(Dollars 254m) on sales of DM25.46bn, the company said, in excess of the
DM400m forecast last December. Net profits on the first four months of the
current financial year stand at DM130m, similar to the level in the same
period one year ago.
'Individual units within the group face difficult economic conditions this
year, but they have a good competitive position compared to other players in
their markets,' according to the annual report. 'That is why we are
optimistic about overall developments, and expect to generate another good
result for the group and the parent in 1991-1992.'
Mr Pieper said the sales figure of DM7.25bn in the first four months
reflected lower prices for steel and non-ferrous metals. However, the
diversification of the group had contributed to the relatively stable
result.
Last year the company benefited from the strong growth in the German
economy. Badly-hit was the group's 51 per cent-owned subsidiary, Metaleurop
SA, which registered a loss thanks to the 29 per cent fall in lead and zinc
prices.

sales slip

<TEXT>
HEINEKEN, the Dutch brewer, posted a 12 per cent rise in net profit in 1991
in spite of a drop in the volume of beer sales caused in part by the Gulf
war.
A stronger second half helped lift Heineken's net profit before
extraordinary items to Fl 409.7m (Dollars 221.5m) from Fl 365.7m in 1990. In
the first half, which bore the brunt of the Gulf war impact, net profit had
risen by less than 1.8 per cent.
Heineken said that the higher-priced premium segment of the European beer
market and the low-alcohol segment had suffered less from last year's
difficult conditions than the overall beer market. This accounts for the
fact that sales proceeds showed a rise even though volume sales fell.
Turnover was up 5.9 per cent at Fl 8.2bn. Heineken declined to give a figure
for volume sales, saying that this would be published in its annual report
on April 2.
'The lower level of sales compared to 1990, resulting from bad weather and
the consequences of the Gulf crisis in the first half of 1991, could not be
fully compensated for in the remaining part of the year,' Heineken noted.
Operating profit rose by 19.2 per cent to Fl 729.9m, outstripping the rise
in net profit, which was held back by an undisclosed 'considerable rise' in
taxes.
Heineken also booked a net Fl 33.2m in extraordinary profits in 1991
stemming from the sale of land in Singapore. A roughly similar amount in
extraordinary gains from the same land disposal is forecast for 1992.
As expected, Heineken left its dividend unchanged at Fl 3.50 per share but
announced a one-for-four distribution of bonus shares to shareholders.
Heineken distributes bonus shares out of its revaluation reserve every three
to four years. Its last bonus issue was in 1989.

FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: Allianz's east German unit
likely to lose DM1.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

<DATELINE>
   MUNICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIANZ, Europe's largest insurer, is likely to make operating losses in
excess of DM1.5bn (Dollars 897m) on Deutsche Versicherungs, its east German
operation, before the business starts trading profitably early in 1996.
The scale of the losses, disclosed yesterday by Mr Uwe Haasen, head of
Allianz's domestic insurance operations, significantly exceeds analysts'
estimates of the cost of Allianz's east German expansion.
However, since the group estimates do not include DM711m paid for Deutsche
Versicherungs or take account of the DM900m poured into the eastern
operations since the acquisition, it is possible that Allianz will not show
a positive return on its east German investment until the next century.
Mr Haasen yesterday conceded that the acquisition was not a 'normal purchase
of a company'. He said it should be seen as a strategic move to 'reoccupy' a
market from which west German insurers have been excluded since the Second
World War.
He argued that the east represented a 25 per cent increase to the German
market, and that over time the insurance needs of east Germans would grow in
line with those of west Germans - at the time of reunification in 1990
Germans in the east spent some 10 per cent of what west Germans spent on
insurance.
Profits would be generated as east German premium rates adjusted to west
German levels, and as productivity was increased, mainly through the staged
reduction of Deutsche Versicherungs 14,000-strong workforce, Mr Haasen said.
Around 10 per cent of the workforce will go this year.
But Mr Haasen warned that the difficulties would not be over, even at the
end of the century, saying it would take longer than that to strengthen the
company's finances by building up reserves.
Mr Haasen indicated that Deutsche Versicherungs's operating losses in 1991
would be in the region of DM550m, following a DM231m loss in the second half
of 1990. Losses this year would be DM350m, dropping to between DM220 and
DM250m in 1993, and DM200m in 1994 before breaking even in 1995.
Pure insurance business in the west is expected to make profits for 1991 of
a similar level to the DM265m of 1990.

FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: John Lewis dips 16% amid tough trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN LEWIS Partnership, the employee-owned department store and supermarket
group, yesterday revealed that it had endured its toughest spell of trading
since the Second World War as profits fell for the third successive year.
At the pre-tax level, annual profits slipped by 16 per cent to Pounds 77.3m
as a result of rising costs and higher interest charges. The company warned
that it expected the 'unhelpful economic climate' to continue.
Some Pounds 30.2m would be shared between the 34,000 employees in the form
of the company's annual bonus. The cash pay-out represented 9 per cent of
annual salary and was the lowest percentage payment since 1958-59 when a 7
per cent distribution was made in preference stock.
On average, each employee (or partner as they are known) will receive a
bonus of Pounds 955 before tax compared with Pounds 1,180 last year.
The company, which runs 22 department stores and 97 Waitrose supermarkets,
increased sales by 6 per cent to Pounds 2.28bn (including VAT) in the year
to January 26. The department stores increased sales by 4 per cent to Pounds
1.13bn while Waitrose supermarkets lifted sales by 8 per cent to Pounds
1.12bn.
Trading profits fell by 9 per cent to Pounds 100.1m as the company's
manufacturing arm was particularly badly hit.
The increase in average borrowings to Pounds 226m resulted in a higher
interest charge of Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 18.4m).
Mr Peter Lewis, chairman, said in the circumstances it had been 'a pretty
solid and certainly very welcome result'.
He pointed out that although the annual bonus distribution was 17 per cent
lower than last year, partners had on average received 5 per cent more pay
in 1991-92 as a result of increases in annual salary.
Everything possible must now be done to curtail the growth in expenses to
align them more closely with increases in revenue, he said.

PRE-TAX PROFITS at Renishaw, the maker of precision metrology and inspection
equipment, fell 24 per cent from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 4.1m in the half-year
to December 31.
Sales fell from Pounds 22.1m to Pounds 21.3m reflecting a depressed
worldwide machine tool sector.
Mr David McMurtry, chairman, blamed most of the profit fall on the decision
to maintain research and development expenditure and investment in
manufacturing which is running at an annual rate of Pounds 5m.
Earnings per share fell to 6.1p (7.6p). An interim dividend of 2.5p (2p) is
declared.

MORE O'FERRALL, the billboard and bus shelter advertising contractor,
suffered 'extremely weak' trading conditions in 1991 and saw pre-tax profits
fall by 40 per cent from Pounds 9.7m to Pounds 5.8m.
However, Mr Russell Gore-Andrews, chairman, said that after a 60 per cent
drop in first-half profits to Pounds 800,000 (Pounds 2m) second-half trading
was 'substantially better'. The shares rose 5p to close at 244p.
The outlook would largely depend on a recovery in the UK market, he said. So
far the first quarter was weaker than last year and there was a hesitancy by
advertisers to commit themselves ahead of the election.
Group turnover fell 3.5 per cent to Pounds 61.7m, but the relatively high
operational gearing in the business meant operating profits fell by 29 per
cent to Pounds 9.2m.
Mr Brian Turnbull, finance director, said the group had cut costs where it
could and capital expenditure had been reduced from Pounds 10m in 1990 to
Pounds 5.8m in 1991, although this was still greater than the Pounds 4.8m
depreciation charge.
The interest charge rose slightly to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 3.3m) as borrowings
increased over the course of the year.
In mid-December the group received the Pounds 13.3m net proceeds of its
1-for-4 rights issue in October, and at the year-end the group's borrowings
had fallen by Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 8.6m, Mr Turnbull said. This
repre-sents a fall in net gearing from 126 per cent to 26 per cent.
A lower tax rate of 29.7 per cent, compared to 33.9 per cent, was achieved
by using tax losses overseas. Mr Turnbull said this would continue in 1992
and beyond. Earnings per share were 14.9p against 24.3p for 1990 after
adjusting for the rights issue.
Mr Gore-Andrews said the group had been confident of keeping its promise of
a final dividend of 10p on the enlarged capital ensuing from the rights
issue, although this left retained profits of only Pounds 16,000 (Pounds
3m).
That gives a total pay-out for the year of 13.2p, unchanged in money terms
but slightly up from the rights-adjusted level of 12.8p.
Operating profits in the UK and Ireland fell 36 per cent to Pounds 7.1m on
sales 8.4 per cent lower at Pounds 38.9m. In Belgium profits were 8.8 per
cent down at Pounds 1.4m, although this hid a good recovery in the second
half after the integration of Visibility, the business acquired in 1990.
A strong performance in France, despite a weak market, lifted profits to
Pounds 855,000 (Pounds 364,000). Losses in the Californian subsidiary more
than offset a recovery in profits from Taiwan in the second half, to give a
loss of Pounds 158,000 (Pounds 42,000 profit) from 'other' areas.
COMMENT
It is hard to get enthusiastic about More O'Ferrall's short-term prospects
after two successive years of 9 per cent falls in UK advertising
expenditure, and a couple of false dawns last year. Media forecasters'
predictions of 10 per cent growth in the advertising market this year may
well prove over-optimistic. And there is also the prospect of a European ban
on tobacco advertising. Tobacco advertisements represent 5 to 7 per cent of
the group's UK turnover and 8 per cent of its Belgian business. Once
business does recover the high operational gearing will mean profits rising
sharply, but this makes forecasting difficult. Assuming some pick up in the
second half of the current year and with the rights money cutting the
interest charge, pre-tax profits could reach Pounds 9m, giving a prospective
p/e of about 12.3. An historic yield of 7.2 per cent sustains interest in
the shares until the expected profit bounce arrives.

FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Power generators under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL POWER and PowerGen will be unable to maintain dividend growth in
the mid-1990s, according to a report published by Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
the stockbroker.
The report is one of the harshest attacks on the two electricity generators
since their privatisation last March.
BZW forecasts pre-tax profits of only Pounds 250m for National Power by the
year ending March 1994, compared with Pounds 500m for the 12 months to March
1992.
For PowerGen, the brokers anticipate a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds
340m to Pounds 170m over the same period.
The report expects earnings per share for both companies to almost halve
over the two years, and dividends to decline from 9p to 7.2p at National
Power and from 9.2p to 7.7p at PowerGen.
BZW believes the main reason for the squeeze on profits will be increased
competition and tighter regulation in the mid-1990s and says shares in both
companies should be sold.
'The shares do not reflect the possible length or depth of a profits
downturn from 1994,' BZW warns.
The stockbroker believes both companies' shares are overvalued by a third
relative to the market.
The generators face the threat of an oversupplied market as new generators
come on stream in the mid-1990s.
Although they are currently protected by contracts to sell electricity put
into place at privatisation, these will expire in March 1993. Then, BZW
forecasts, the market will be oversupplied and returns will fall.
A second threat is Offer, the electricity watchdog. 'Offer is intent on
realising the benefits of competition in generation,' BZW says.
The stockbrokers expect Offer to be tougher than investors anticipate, and
prevent the generators from artificially boosting electricity prices by
closing power stations to tighten supply.
Offer will force the generators to offer these stations to their
competitors, BZW believes.

FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Woolwich plans 40 T&amp;C closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTY OF the 78 branches of Town &amp; Country, the building society which was
taken over by Woolwich Building Society last October, are to be shut down
when the merger of the two societies is completed early in May.
News of the closures, which are likely to make a substantial number of T&amp;C's
800 staff redundant, were announced along with news of a sharp fall in
Woolwich's profits during 1991 because of sharply increased provisions
against bad debts.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy chief executive, said it was impossible to say at
this stage how many T&amp;C staff would lose their jobs.
Woolwich's pre-tax profits fell by 21 per cent to Pounds 136.4m (Pounds
173m). Bad debt provisions were Pounds 72.4m, up from Pounds 32m in 1990. In
addition the society wrote off loan losses of Pounds 23m during the year.
Its assets grew from Pounds 18.2bn to Pounds 20.2bn during the year, but its
two main businesses, savings and mortgage lending, both contracted.
Lending was down to Pounds 3.1bn (Pounds 3.6bn), while net receipts of
savings in 1991 were Pounds 1.12bn (Pounds 1.45bn).
'We decided not to push the boat out in a thin market,' said Mr Donald
Kirkham, chief executive. He said that the Woolwich had held its own in
market share terms.
During the year, Woolwich enlarged its network of estate agencies and took
over T&amp;C. It also developed its European mortgage operations in France and
Italy. Mr Kirkham said these investments were the main reason why the
society's cost-income ratio rose from 53.7 to 59.9 per cent, about 10
percentage points higher than the industry average.
Woolwich's results contrasted with a sparkling 1991 performance announced
yesterday by Yorkshire, the 12th largest society.
Its pre-tax profits rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 52.6m. Total mortgage
lending was up by 15 per cent to Pounds 979m, while the society's assets
grew by 17 per cent to Pounds 4.18bn.
Yorkshire's cost-income ratio dropped to 42 per cent, its lowest ever level.
Loan loss provisions were Pounds 15.3m, up from Pounds 9m in 1990.
The society's strong showing partly reflected the fact that much of its
customer base is in the north of England which has been less affected by the
recession than the south-east.
Mr Derek Roberts, chief executive, said that his society's strong all-round
performance demonstrated that it was well equipped to deal with tough market
conditions. 'Although bad debt provisions are high, the society has been
protected by its prudent levels of growth during the boom years in the
housing market,' he said.

FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Courtney Pope seeks Pounds 5m refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURTNEY Pope Holdings, the shopfitting group where several subsidiaries
were put into receivership or closed to save two profitable ones, is being
refinanced under a new management team.
A Pounds 5.1m rights issue will bring the company back to net worth of
Pounds 2.9m. Alongside the issuing of additional shares to satisfy Pounds 1m
bank debt, the group's indebtedness will be reduced to less than Pounds
800,000.
The new management - Mr George Duncan, Mr Tim Wightman and Mr Nino Allenza -
will own 7.6 per cent of the equity after putting up Pounds 650,000. They
are changing the company's name to that of their private concern, Rubicon
Group.
Courtney Pope has been run by Mr Ronnie Aitken, a company doctor, since
October 1990. Its debts peaked at more than Pounds 13m. During the rescue,
eight subsidiaries were put into administrative receivership and eight
others were closed or sold.
The group's bank debt was reduced to Pounds 4m last year. About Pounds 3m of
the issue proceeds will go to the banks. To settle other liabilities, shares
will be issued to Barclays, which will own 7.5 per cent of the equity, and
NatWest, giving it just over 4 per cent.
The remaining core of the business comprises Versatile, a maker of
shopfittings for and Potrafke (UK), a supplier of moving belt checkouts.
In the six months to November 30, for which the results were also announced
yesterday, Courtney Pope made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 963,000 (loss of
Pounds 3.45m) on sales of Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 32.4m). This followed a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.9m in 1990-91 and a retained loss of Pounds 15.6m.
Earnings per share were 5.5p (loss of 28.6p).
The rights issue price of 85p is after a capital reconstruction which will
turn 10 existing shares into one, making yesterday's closing price of 9 1/2
p effectively 95p.

FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Recession-hit Sema falls to Pounds 14m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS OF Sema Group, the Anglo-French computing services company, fell
from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 14m pre-tax for 1991.
Mr Pierre Bonelli, chairman, said market conditions were the worst the
industry had experienced, but added that he was satisfied with the group's
overall performance.
Turnover rose 10 per cent to Pounds 412.5m, but at the operating level,
profits were little changed at Pounds 16.5m (Pounds 16.7m). Favourable tax
charges left net profits marginally higher at Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 10.4m).
Earnings per share rose from 10.45p to 11.02p and a proposed final dividend
of 1.6p makes a 2.6p (2.5p) total.
The group's trading performance suffered from the same malaise that has
depressed profits at virtually all the large European computing services
companies.
The recession in the UK, France and Germany has forced customers to delay
projects while defence budgets have been steadily declining.
Mr Bonelli said he was satisfied with turnover growth of the UK arm, which
rose 17 per cent over the year from Pounds 123.8m to Pounds 145m.
It was, he said, very profitable but he refused to give pre-tax profit
figures for individual European countries.
Germany proved a black spot where growth was essentially static at Pounds
31.7m (Pounds 31.6m.)
Profitability was also hit by start-up costs associated with the formation
of BAe-Sema, the joint venture established last year to bid for large
defence contracts in Europe, the Far East and the Middle East.
Mr Bonelli said trading in the current year would be tough. He had seen no
sign of an upturn.
Sema's shares closed 4p higher at 239p.

FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: O'Reilly builds stake in Conroy Petroleum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ONGOING battle for control of Conroy Petroleum, the Irish exploration
group, took an unexpected turn yesterday with the announcement that Mr Tony
O'Reilly, one of the country's leading businessmen, has taken an additional
16.3 per cent stake, writes Tim Coone.
Mr O'Reilly has bought out the entire interest of Dundee Bancorp in Conroy
through Columbia Investments, a company which he controls.
Last month Dundee Bancorp and Outokumpu, the two principal shareholders,
successfully ousted Conroy's entire board, including Mr Richard Conroy, the
chairman. The two shareholders were incensed at Mr Conroy's decision last
year to take over Mr O'Reilly's Atlantic Resources, an ailing oil and gas
exploration company.
Mr Brendan Gilmore, the new co-chairman, following Mr O'Reilly's increased
stake, said: 'We are looking forward to a long-term relationship with
Outokumpu at shareholder and board level.'
He said that 'no commitments' had been made regarding future ore marketing
arrangements but added: 'I would hope we would be able to develop a
relationship which would be positive for all the shareholders.'
Mr O'Reilly's beneficial interest in Conroy is now 20.5 per cent and
together with Mr Conroy and 'those who are deemed to be concert parties with
him' now controls a total of 28.9 per cent.
The 9.025m shares held by Dundee were sold at 80p each, a substantial
premium over the previous day's trading when Conroy's shares closed in
London at about 50p.

FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Book discounting policy helps Pentos
advance 7% to Pounds 15.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TERRY MAHER, chairman of Pentos, the book retailing and office equipment
group, yesterday announced a 7 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 15.2m for the year to end-December.
At the same time Mr Maher reopened his campaign against the net-book
agreement, the voluntary agreement which sets minimum prices for most books.
The Pentos chairman revealed the first results since last winter's campaign
against the net-book agreement, when the company offered discounts of 25 per
cent on some 20 books published outside the NBA by Reed International.
Mr Maher said that December sales at Dillons, the main Pentos chain, had
risen by 23.5 per cent compared with 3 per cent for booksellers as a whole.
When newly-opened Dillons stores were excluded and the comparison was
limited to existing shops year-on-year the increase was 8 per cent, compared
to 1 per cent for bookshops as a whole.
The controversial bookseller said that Dillons' share of Reed's turnover had
increased by more than 50 per cent.
Customers who bought discounted titles had bought an average of two other
books and secondary purchases had been worth Pounds 29, almost three times
Dillons' usual transaction value of Pounds 10.
'I believe we have shown as conclusively as possible that professional
marketing works in the book trade,' Mr Maher said.
He yesterday appealed to other publishers to join Reed in publishing books
outside the NBA so that they could be discounted.
So far no other publisher has joined Reed, and most booksellers are very
sceptical about the benefits of discounting.
The group's Pounds 15.2m profits were achieved on net sales of Pounds 204m -
an increase of 19 per cent.
Earnings per share at 9.1p were 2 per cent down, but a final dividend of
2.05p is recommended making a total for the year of 2.75p, a rise of 10 per
cent.
Total sales at Ryman were 3 per cent ahead, and sales in some shops equalled
the previous year.
Office furniture sales fell by 10 per cent and profit was cut by a third to
Pounds 3.7m.
'In the midst of the longest and deepest recession since the Second World
War a profit increase of 7 per cent represents a satisfactory outcome for
1991. In particular Dillons performance was outstanding,' said Mr Maher.
Dillons sales were 37 per cent ahead, or 23 per cent excluding Hatchards
which was included for only part of 1990, he added.
Pentos shares closed up 1p at 138p.

FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Raine to acquire Walter Lawrence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAINE INDUSTRIES yesterday announced it had agreed to acquire Walter
Lawrence in an all-share offer valuing the company at Pounds 28.5m. A
takeover would create the UK's 10th largest house builder, producing about
2,000 homes a year.
The offer was accompanied by an announcement of a 2-for-7 rights issue,
priced at 95p a share, to raise Pounds 33.5m.
The rights issue cash will be used to reduce Walter Lawrence's high
borrowings of Pounds 74m, said Mr Peter Parkin, Raine's chief executive.
If the bid succeeds Raine will be left with net debt of about Pounds 45m,
including acquisition costs, equivalent to 33 per cent of combined
shareholders' funds of Pounds 133m.
Preference shareholders are being offered 100p cash for each share or can
elect to accept a share offer.
Newarthill, which operates Robert McAlpine, the private construction company
and owns almost 18 per cent of Walter Lawrence's ordinary shares and 11 per
cent of the preference, has indicated that it will accept Raine's offer.
Raine's share price yesterday fell 15 1/2 p to 108 1/2 p valuing Walter
Lawrence's ordinary shares at 54p each. Lawrence's shares which were trading
at 23p before the announcement jumped to 46p.
Mr Parkin also revealed that Raine's pre-tax profits had fallen by more than
a quarter from Pounds 8.2m to Pounds 5.8 during the six months to
end-December.
He said the group would be paying a maintained interim dividend of 2p
covered 1.5 times by earnings of 3p (4p). Raine said it intended to pay a
same-again final dividend of 4p for year ending June 30.
Raine said that it had looked at several acquisition opportunities before
alighting on Walter Lawrence. These are understood to have included YJ
Lovell in which Raine acquired a 2.8 per cent stake last year at a price of
about 140p a share.
Lovell's share price has since collapsed, closing last night at 24p. Raine's
interim results include a Pounds 3.4m provision to cover the writing down of
the value of its holdings in Lovell.
The acquisition will increase the geographical spread of Raine's housing
operations to cover most areas of England. Walter Lawrence also has a
Californian housing business taking Raine into the US housing market on the
back of Walter for the first time.
COMMENT
Raine in doing its sums has written down the book value of Walter Lawrence
from Pounds 51m to Pounds 25.5m equivalent to about 50p a share - not far
short of the bid price itself. It will have a combined UK landbank of about
6,000 plots at an average book value of Pounds 12,500. This should produce
gross margins of about 25 per cent and net margins of 10 per cent even if
the market does not improve. There should, according to Raine, be no
dilution of earnings despite the issue of large amounts of paper. It can
always sell the Californian business if things do not go as well as
expected. Walter Lawrence shareholders meanwhile will get a substantial
premium above the Lawrence's recently lack-lustre share price. Raine should
be capable of making Pounds 15m this year producing earnings of 8p with the
prospect of a housing recovery some stage in the future. The rights and the
offer on this basis should be supported.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGER &amp; Friedlander, the merchant banking and property group, yesterday
signalled its resilience to recession in the UK economy by reporting a 13.5
per cent increase to Pounds 15.41m in pre-tax profits for 1991.
Earnings per share were up from 3.92p in 1990 to 4.8p. The dividend is
unchanged at 2.5p. Mr Anthony Solomons, group chairman, said that dividend
cover was below 2 and it would not have been appropriate to increase the
pay-out.
Instead the group yesterday bought 31.5m of its own shares, about 14 per
cent of its capital, in the market for Pounds 12.5m or 40p per share. The
purchase included the entire holding of 24.45m of its shares from the
supervisors of B&amp;C Investment Holdings.
'This enhances the assets and earnings per share for the rest of the
shareholders,' Mr Solomons said.
Group assets grew from Pounds 708m in 1990 to Pounds 744.6m. The group's
banking operations made a profit of Pounds 7.01m, up from Pounds 6.57m.
There was an extraordinary profit of Pounds 4.76m from the sale of a stake
in Takare for Pounds 25.4m.
Singer's shares closed the day at 44p, up 3p.

FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Steetley downgrades its French reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEETLEY, which is fighting a Pounds 600m takeover bid from Redland, its
rival building materials group, yesterday published its final defence
document in which it stressed the high earnings potential of its US and
European businesses.
The document, however, reveals that the group has been forced to cut Pounds
40m from the book value of its French operations following an independent
revaluation.
It says that a reappraisal of reserves owned by Gobitta, the French
aggregates group for which it agreed to pay FFr850m in 1990, had revealed
that there were 94m tonnes, including 79m tonnes of sand and gravel. At the
time of the acquisition Steetley said the reserves of sand and gravel were
nearer 150m tonnes.
The revaluation of assets produced a net asset value per share of 375p,
rising to 394p if the value to Redland of Steetley's Pounds 29m surplus
advance corporation tax is included.
This compares with a bid price worth 386p a share at last night's closing
prices.
Steetley said that French construction activity was forecast to grow by an
average of 2.5 per cent a year between 1992 and 1996. It said cost savings
as a result of rationalising the French operations and lower raw material
costs would produce savings of Pounds 8m in 1993 and Pounds 16m in 1994.
It argued that Redland's offer did not take into account the benefits of
savings or the potential for earnings growth in the UK, US and Spain as
construction markets moved out of recession.
It said that a 15 per cent increase in sales volume in the UK would more
than double this year's budgeted profits.
Mr Richard Miles, Steetley chief executive, said his company's earnings
growth had consistently outstripped that of Redland during the past decade.
'Redland's bid does not even start to value this company's future based on
the ability of its management to produce an outperformance from its high
quality assets.'

FT  06 MAR 92 / Bryant &amp; May faces price freeze: Monopolies body says UK
matchmaker abused its market dominance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRYANT &amp; MAY, the UK match manufacturer, faces a two-year price freeze on
its branded matches after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report found
it had abused its dominant position in the UK market to make excessive
profits.
Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday the MMC had
found that Bryant &amp; May had been able to achieve high prices for matches as
a result of its very high market share. This had led to excessive profits
and higher prices for consumers.
This was the second MMC inquiry in four years into the UK market for matches
and disposable lighters.
Mr Lilley said he had asked the director general of fair trading to seek an
undertaking from Bryant &amp; May on match prices. Before the end of the
two-year price freeze, the director general would review the market to see
whether further controls were needed.
Mr Lilley said he also accepted the MMC's recommendation that Bryant &amp; May
should not in future conclude agreements with its customers on discounts,
exclusive sales, promotion and minimum stocking which were likely to
strengthen its position and weaken that of competitors. The match
manufacturer will also be required to give an undertaking on this.
In 1990 Bryant &amp; May accounted for 78 per cent of the UK match market said
to be worth about Pounds 100m a year, with brands such as Swan Vesta (21 per
cent) and Cooks Household matches (12 per cent).
Mr David Wheeler, managing director, said although disappointed by the MMC
report the company would co-operate with the Office of Fair Trading.
But the company felt the inquiry had been 'a waste of taxpayer's money' and
would have 'very little impact on the public interest.'
'A box of matches costs less than one cigarette and matches represent only
two pence in every Pounds 100 of consumer spending in supermarkets', he
said.
Mr Wheeler added that Bryant &amp; May believed its profitability was due to its
quality and efficiency. He pointed out that one Commission member had
dissented from the report because he felt companies bought from Bryant &amp;
May, as opposed to foreign competitors, due to the quality of its product
and the efficiency of its distribution network.
The MMC inquiry made no adverse findings with respect to lighters. Bryant &amp;
May is the largest supplier of both disposable and semi-disposable
(refillable) lighters. All disposable lighters sold in the UK are imported.
Bryant &amp; May is part of Wilkinson Sword, the consumer products company sold
in 1987 for Pounds 99.2m by Allegheny International of the US to Swedish
Match, the Stockholm-based conglomerate.
The MMC approved the merger saying that if the combined company attempted to
abuse its dominant position UK retailers would switch to foreign
competition.
Since 1987 Bryant &amp; May's profits have soared, although it has only raised
its prices in line with inflation, and the foreign competition has largely
fizzled out.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Letter: Italian Treasury minister explains position on
monetary creation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GUIDO CARLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In a correspondence from Rome, published in your international edition
('Italian public sector deficit overshoots', February 28), you note that the
Italian Treasury 'continues to use its overdraft facility with the Bank of
Italy, though this credit window is due to be closed', as you discuss at
length in a previous article ('Italy's monetary parting of ways', February
19).
As a matter of fact, in the past two years the Treasury has reduced its debt
position vis-a-vis the Bank of Italy: by L1,383bn in 1990, and L9,404bn in
1991. Thus, the reality of the 1980s - when central bank financing of the
budget deficit was, although at a decreasing pace, the major source of money
creation - has been reversed in the past two years. As the data in the table
indicate, in 1990 the growth of the monetary base was due almost entirely to
the balance of payments surplus; in 1991, to open market operations by the
central bank. In both years, the Treasury's contribution to the growth rate
of base money has been negative.
Of course, this is no excuse for delaying the closing of the credit window.
It suggests, however, that at least as far as the direct monetary financing
of the Treasury is concerned, Italy has been satisfying the Maastricht
criteria for quite some time. We wish we could say the same about the budget
figures your article correctly points to.
Guido Carli,
minister of treasury, Rome

FT  06 MAR 92 / Letter: Measuring the depth of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NIGEL WILKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, By arguing that it is premature to suggest that the present recession
has been the longest since the Second World War, Andrew Sentance (Letters,
February 29) neglects to take account of the fact that the recession is, of
course, not yet over.
If we use the definition put forward by Professor Douglas McWilliams
(economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry), that the length
of the recession is represented by the period of time taken for the economy
to reach its previous peak in output, the 3.9 per cent drop in economic
activity since that previous peak will need to be made good by the third
quarter of 1993.
However, not even the CBI is forecasting growth on that scale over the next
18 months, and some hefty subsequent revisions in the official data will be
needed to reduce the length of the recession to within that experienced in
previous post-war recessions.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Letter: Soft commissions and conflicts of interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NIGEL JOHNSON-HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader on soft commissions ('Soft on soft commissions', March 3)
rightly highlights the potential conflicts of interest that can lead to best
execution being compromised when a fund manager is locked into dealing with
a specific broker.
The lack of transparency, you state, opens the door to cross-subsidies and
inefficiencies in the system.
Your comments should really be applied to the large, integrated securities
houses that engage in soft commissions. Yes, best execution is compromised
because the fund manager's orders are locked into one market maker, and yes,
there is a lack of transparency that leads to cross-subsidising of the
loss-making sales arm by the highly profitable market-making arm of the
integrated house (a practice which is questionable under current rules).
Therefore your attack on soft commissions would be more accurate if it were
directed at the integrated houses rather than at soft commissions as a
whole.
As an independent stockbroker offering soft commission arrangements, we are
completely free of any conflicts, and as pure agency brokers we always seek
the best price for any order, wherever that price may be found.
Furthermore, we provide an essential link in the chain that allows
independent research to compete with the apparently endless flood of
indifferent research from securities firms.
Please don't tar us, the specialist independent agency brokers, with the
same brush as you should be tarring those large integrated houses whose
conflicts of interest are giving soft commissions a bad name.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Letter: Eastern Europe: no alternative to shock therapy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDERS ASLUND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Prowse lashes out at 'shock therapists' in general and me in
particular ('The drawbacks of shock therapy', March 2). His arguments are
typical of European socialism of times passed.
Rather than looking into the actual situation of the former communist
countries, he refers parochially to postwar Europe, failing to see how
limited its relevance is. Also, conditions in east Asia were completely
different.
The collapse of communism left Poland, Bulgaria and the former Soviet Union
in hyperinflation. The only cure known is strict macroeconomic
stabilisation, or what Mr Prowse contemptuously calls 'shock therapy'.
Nor does Mr Prowse realise the extraordinary degradation and corruption of
the state administration in the former communist countries. To argue in
favour of intrusive state regulations under such conditions is to favour the
corrupt. An obvious parallel is the end of feudalism in Europe, which was
followed by laisser faire in the 1840s, in the absence of a working state
administration.
My chief lesson from the Polish experience is that deregulation has not gone
far enough. Therefore, red tape and corruption are thriving, blocking
economic recovery.
Finally, Mr Prowse accuses me of not having predicted the current big fall
in production in Russia. Anyone who knows my writing can witness that I have
expected a stark, inevitable fall in Russian industrial production (of some
35 per cent) in connection with the change of system.
While Mr Prowse continues to fight for socialism in the columns of the
Financial Times, the Russian government as well as I and my colleagues are
concerned with helping the Russian people from the frightful plight of
socialism.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Pie in the sky in Rio
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WILL be a miracle equivalent to the saving of Noah from the Great Flood
if this summer's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro achieves its organisers'
aims. The enormous gathering of politicians, officials and green campaigners
must overcome two severe handicaps. It is being hijacked by the Third World,
and it lacks the full support of the United States. This is not to say that
its timing is wrong. In theory, it should reflect both the rise in popular
concern about the environment and the huge re-ordering of political
priorities that has followed the ending of the Cold War. As such, it
represents an opportunity to identify some of the most pressing issues
facing the world.
Yet the final preparatory meetings now taking place in New York are not
encouraging. As matters stand, this much-trumpeted event will do little more
than add to the hot air which is already generating so many worries about
the world's climate. The coming weeks will need some rigorous work by the
organisers if Rio is to produce results.
This is partly due to the enthusiasm with which the summit's backers have
thrown themselves into the task. Just about every issue from the ozone layer
to the ocean depths has been put on the summit agenda; as a result, the plan
of action that participants will be asked to sign runs to many hundreds of
pages. The amount of cash being demanded to support these voluminous
proposals - over Dollars 100bn a year - is totally unrealistic.
North-South balance
It is easy to see where the money would go. The preparatory work has been
increasingly dominated, not by environmental questions, but by the problems
of the poorer countries: their backwardness, the inequalities of the
North-South balance, the barriers to development. These are legitimate
issues, since poverty is as much a source of pollution as industrialisation.
But the Summit must not permit itself to be waylaid into treating the
troubles of the developing world as if they were central to the world's
environmental problems. The purpose of the gathering is to lay the
groundwork for sustainable growth - that is, to permit the world economy to
advance without ruining the environment. These are, at present, matters for
the industrialised nations whose wasteful habits have caused the greatest
damage. The richer countries are central to the debate. They may be obliged
to pay off poorer countries faced with heavy clean-growth costs, although
not to the extent of Dollars 100bn. They must show by example that
environmental good practice need not inhibit economic development.
Narrower focus
The Summit would stand a better chance of succeeding if it narrowed its
focus to a few important issues, and used the spotlight of Rio to bring
pressure for action in those areas. For example, it could attempt to break
the deadlock among industrial countries over energy policy. At the moment,
no single country wants to introduce tough fiscal or regulatory curbs on its
own. The US is the most reluctant, on any terms. Its presidential
campaigners might respond to its environmental movement in this election
year.
Another practical aim would be to devise a more sensible global regime for
trade in agricultural goods. The absurd subsidies which cause widespread
overfarming but also prevent poorer nations from exporting their produce
have a profoundly damaging effect on the natural environment. The Summit
could give a fresh impetus to the issues that have become deadlocked in the
Gatt.
A third goal might be to create a clearing house for environment-friendly
technology. If Third World aid is to be an aspect of the Summit, the richer
nations might consider additional ways by which this technology could be
transferred to the less well off.
The Summit will fail if it does not adopt a businesslike approach to matters
which are all too often coloured by emotion allied to special interests. The
future of the planet is a serious matter. It requires a serious
international forum where the right priorities can be established.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Mr Kohl goes to Washington
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN HELMUT Kohl goes to Washington in a couple of weeks, he will do so as
leader of Europe's most powerful country, as chairman of the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries and, not least, as a politician who is not
facing an imminent election. These assets will not make him more popular
with his hosts. They will merely make them more demanding.
Leading Washington columnists are now writing of Mr Kohl's country as
'economic enemy number 1', along with France. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, his
economics minister, can readily tell Mr Kohl why. Many Americans believe
that he has failed to deliver on promises of support for the Uruguay Round
given at G7 summits. They complain that he places German farmers, his own
obdurate farm minister, Mr Ignaz Kiechle, and, not least, his friend, the
beleaguered Francois Mitterrand, above both his promises and his country's
wider economic interests. Nobody expects constructive contributions from Mr
Mitterrand's France; but they expect more from Mr Kohl's Germany.
If Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt's director general, expected the Draft Final
Act of the Uruguay Round proposed last December to bring about completion of
the round by Easter, it now seems he will be disappointed. The complex
negotiations over market access in manufactures, in agriculture and in
services have many hurdles to jump. More important, matters of fundamental
principle - largely in agriculture - need to be resolved. Like many before,
the Easter deadline looks like being passed.
US protectionists
Some will ask whether this matters. The end of the Uruguay Round may, like
the Italy sought by Virgil's hero Aeneas, disappear into the distance. Yet
the world goes on. The American administration may even prefer not to put
the final results to Congress before the election. Protectionists may not
have swept the board in the presidential primaries, but congressmen will
still stand up for local interests. So why not negotiate for a while longer?
With the round bound to be caught up in the American election campaign, with
frictions certain to grow in many areas of trade, the Uruguay round already
looks a poor bet. The longer it continues the worse becomes the bet. A
never-ending negotiation now looks as likely a fate for the Uruguay Round as
eventual success. But breakdown looks more likely than either.
Agricultural concessions
What makes delay so depressing is that an agreement no longer seems
impossible, even in agriculture. But the alternative notion, that
agriculture can be put to one side, should be forgotten. Too many countries
regard agricultural liberalisation as the main benefit of the round. They
will not accept deals elsewhere without concessions on agriculture.
At present, the ball is in the European Community's court. It is no use for
the EC to complain about the grandiose American demands for complete
liberalisation. These disappeared as soon as the EC came up with an offer,
in the autumn of 1990. The problem now is that EC says it wants changes in
the text presented by Mr Dunkel. But the EC has been unable to agree on the
changes it wants.
The failure to make these demands reflects the EC's stalemate over reform of
the common agricultural policy. The obstacle, as always, is the farm
ministers. It is ludicrous that the EC's position on a matter which vitally
affects its own future and its relations with the rest of the world should
be decided by agricultural backwoodsmen. What is needed, instead, is
involvement by EC heads of government.
Since another failure would damage both Mr Bush's domestic credibility and
American attitudes to its main trading partners, a G7 summit would be too
risky. The first step is, in any case, an EC agreement on the linked issues
of CAP reform and the Uruguay Round. When Mr Kohl goes to Washington he
should be able to tell his hosts that not only has a meeting of EC heads of
government been called, but that he will put his formidable weight behind
the outcome his hosts want and the world needs.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Personal View: The wrong type of relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDITH FREEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Extending tax relief for childcare must be a real temptation to the
beleaguered chancellor.
The logic seems obvious. A shortage of labour and skills is predicted,
despite the recession. Many women with young children wish and/or need to
engage in paid work, but have difficulty in obtaining good, affordable
childcare. Childcare costs must be paid out of taxed income with the added
affront that tax and national insurance must also be paid by the carer.
Where enlightened employers provide childcare it is taxed as a benefit in
kind in the hands of the employee, unless it falls within the restrictive
conditions applying to workplace nursery relief. All considerations seem to
point towards an extended relief.
The politically correct view follows this 'logic'. Its proponents are
vociferous and influential. A recent Gallup poll showed that 81 per cent of
voters favour tax relief for childcare. Yet the logic is spurious and the
concentration of effort on the case for tax relief a distraction from issues
of low pay for women and inadequate public provision for children.
Extension of the existing anomalous relief would produce further anomalies.
Wherever the chancellor drew the line, he would be accused of being unfair.
Confining relief to employer-provided or assisted care, administratively the
most practical approach, would raise a clamour from the self-employed and
those not receiving assistance from employers. Extension of relief to all
childcare costs would be greeted by calls from other equally deserving
carers, such as those caring for elderly parents. Unpaid mothers caring for
their own children would also claim their due.
What of the grounds for tax-deductible childcare? First, equity. A parent
with responsibility for a child incurs a necessary expense on childcare,
which must be paid before any profit is made from earnings. This expense
should be deductible, it is argued, like other costs of earning.
However, many essential expenditures are not deductible, travel and clothing
being prime examples. This is not just some quirk of the tax system. The
legislative requirement that deductible expenditure must be incurred wholly
and exclusively in connection with work done contains claims in a practical
way.
Instead of a free-for-all, with each taxpayer claiming as much as he can get
away with, we have a system of personal allowances that helps every taxpayer
to meet this type of expenditure. A system without limits on deductibility
of expenditures would benefit the extravagant more than the frugal; the
wealthy more than the poor. Similarly, full tax deductibility for childcare
would favour those using the most expensive type of carer, though more than
two thirds of employed parents of pre-school children rely on relatives.
Nannies would still be totally out of reach for many.
For these reasons, any general childcare deduction would have to be capped.
This would, in fact, be the first step to a standard deduction for all
parents. At present, parents without earned income cannot use their
non-transferable personal allowances, unless they have investments. On the
other hand, the benefits of their unpaid labour are not taxed. The current
system is, therefore, probably as fiscally neutral as possible. To introduce
tax relief for childcare expenditure, without assistance for parents at
home, would upset this balance. A much better way than a standard deduction
for all parents is to increase child benefit, which has the added advantage
of being of value to non-taxpayers.
This solution makes no concession to those who argue that the tax system
should provide a work incentive, but they are on sticky ground. If the
demographic predictions are correct, fiscal incentives should be
unnecessary. Employers will need women in the workforce and will have to pay
them accordingly. Tax subsidies for childcare will only undermine market
pressures. Assistance for women in the workforce would be far better
directed at training and other specific areas of need, rather than being
spread across all working mothers, many of whom would return to work in any
event.
Finally, there is the question of supply of childcare, which is the
strongest argument for workplace nursery relief. But the history of this
relief shows that supply issues cannot be kept separate from questions of
equity. It is not possible to ring-fence a relief for employer-assisted
childcare and expect this fence to hold up against the inevitable pressures
from those excluded. If provision of childcare is the objective, there are
more direct and less inequitable ways of achieving this.
Extending tax relief for childcare could win Lamont short-term acclaim;
temptation, indeed, just now. But if he believes he will be around to deal
with the consequences, he should think hard before he goes any farther down
this road.

Remember what happened to National Home Loans after it took a bunch of

subsequently under-performed the market by 97 per cent, the chairman and
chief executive quit, and the nicest thing one can say about the company
currently is that it is 'distressed'.
Well, it now seems that Trinity International, publisher of the Liverpool
Daily Post and Echo, has booked Concorde to ferry another party of
'independent' analysts the 225 miles from London to Liverpool so they get to
next month's Grand National on time. An embarrassed PR man warns Observer
not to jump to conclusions. Trinity is a picture of financial health and
Concorde was flying to Liverpool anyway.
Of course.

Des Wilson, election-campaign manager for Britain's Liberal Democrats, was
in chipper mood when unveiling yet another electioneering poster even though
his party's advertising budget is only Pounds 1.5m or so against Labour's
Pounds 8m and the Tories' Pounds 20m. The Lib Dems' money will go farther,
he claimed, not least because the likes of Conservative chairman Chris
Patten travel first-class on the railway whereas Wilson goes economy.
His main worry apparently lies in the ubiquitous mobile telephone. During
the 1987 election campaign, he said, politicians of all colours were plagued
by journalists who asked questions, then phoned the answers through to
fellow hacks elsewhere who promptly put other politicians of the same party
on the spot.
Wilson quotes former Liberal MP John Pardoe as saying to a couple of
bodyguards in a previous election: 'Forget the assassins. Just shoot the
next journalist who comes close with a mobile phone.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 64-year-old boss of Daimler-Benz Edzard Reuter may be staying another
two years beyond his official retirement date, but it is all change at
vehicle subsidiary Mercedes-Benz.
With Reuter around until end-1995, one person ruled out as his successor is
the combative Werner Niefer, Reuter's deputy and head of Mercedes-Benz. Now
with an honorary professorship and two honorary doctorates under his belt,
Niefer began his career at Daimler aged 15 as a tool-making apprentice. But
he has tripped more recently, not least as the result of an incident in
Italy when he injured a German woman tourist whilst at the wheel of a
Mercedes bus.
Niefer, 63, goes at normal retirement age next year, making way for the
suave self-confident 55-year-old Helmut Werner, now head of trucks, as his
successor and probable Reuter replacement.
Niefer's consolation, it seems, is to pick his successor's senior
colleagues. The supervisory board yesterday formally approved Bernd
Gottschalk, who at 48 heads the Brazil operation, to replace Werner, and
Dieter Zetsche, just 38 and president of Daimler's US truck company
Freightliner, to take over as head of car development. Mercedes was strongly
hinting that Niefer, 'in the interests of continuity', had got the very men
he wanted.
Maybe Werner will have to wait to rise one step further for his own wish
list.

The fact that central bankers rarely appear in the real world does not mean
they can't be just as bitchy as the rest of us. Any reader who doubts it
need only peruse the 800-plus pages of John Fforde's up-date of the Bank of
England's official history.
True, it covers only the 17 years to 1958 and concentrates on the Bank's
role in policy-making. But astute use of the index, concentrating on
'character and abilities', throws up some gems.
Take Sir George Bolton who went on to be chairman of the Bank of London and
South America. 'Although he was a fount of imaginative ideas on all
questions within - or indeed without - his parish, Bolton's judgment was at
times erratic and over-influenced by his personal opinions,' writes Fforde
who, like Bolton, is a former Bank executive director.
Then there was chief cashier Percy Beale who was 'widely considered
arrogant' and packed off to India because he was never going to make it onto
the Court. Lucius Thompson-McCausland, a long-standing economic adviser
nick-named Lucifer, liked nothing better than constructing ingenious schemes
using variables such as 'flabby' and 'taut' money.
Even Roy Bridge, the Bank's famous foreign-exchange dealer, is mentioned in
dispatches for the 'almost clinical interest in good food and wine' which he
picked up on his frequent foreign trips defending the pound.
But perhaps the most poignant note refers to the farewell dinner for Montagu
Norman after the Bank was nationalised. Although he had dominated the Bank
for 22 years, all that Britain's most famous central banker could think to
put in his diary was 'Bk. Goodbye dinner.'
The only clue to the sadness Norman must have felt was a subsequent
conversation he had with Per Jacobsson of the Bank for International
Settlements. Asked whether the nationalised Bank of England was still the
same place, Norman replied: 'They try to pretend it is.'

FT  06 MAR 92 / Arts: Rare operas produced in Lyon and Geneva / Review of
Busoni's 'Turandot' and Berlioz's 'Benvenuto Cellini'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All that remains of the dear old Opera building in the centre of Lyon is its
four stone walls, which will provide the shell for a new multi-storey
theatre complex opening in May next year. The project speaks of a
risk-taking spirit, tons of public money and a mission to extend opera's
contemporary appeal - just the combination which has helped the Opera de
Lyon to maintain a high-quality profile during these past six years of
enforced homelessness.
The current season includes both Puccini's Turandot and Busoni's earlier,
German-language opera of the same name, last revived at Wexford in 1988
after a long period of neglect. Perhaps things are beginning to look up for
Busoni. After four staged performances in the Auditorium Maurice Ravel,
Turandot will be commercially recorded together with Arlecchino, which was
premiered on the same bill in Zurich in 1917. The Lyon production made just
about the strongest imaginable case for the Busoni work.
Staged by Henry Akina and conducted by Kent Nagano, Turandot came over as a
compact, highly-charged blockbuster. Busoni reveals himself as a
master-technician: the dramatic structure is taut, the scene-painting swift
and punchy. Turandot's three riddles - with more than a musical whiff of the
Wanderer-Mime encounter at the beginning of Siegfried - are answered by the
end of the first act, and the whole show is over in 90 minutes.
The music is a pot-pourri of sounds and styles - neo-Romantic harmonies,
oriental pastiche, even some choral variations on 'Greensleeves' - none of
which lingers long enough to become tiresome. The plot, too, is a bit of a
hybrid, largely because Busoni took Gozzi much more to heart than Puccini
did. In Busoni's hands, Chinese antiquity ranks as little more than an
incidental setting for the marriage of Italian commedia dell'arte to
post-Wagnerian music-theatre - a bit like Ariadne auf Naxos, but with a
pronounced air of tragi-comedy.
This collision of cultures was the key to Ric Schachtebeck's designs for the
Lyon production. The stage - a triangular platform free of the usual
proscenium constrictions - was dominated by a pair of expressionist panels,
decorated with three Chinese riddle-motifs and flanked by a sloping
rubbish-dump of masks and theatrical accessories. The costumes ran the gamut
from oriental black head-dresses to ceremonial morning suits, while Calaf
and Turandot looked as if they had dropped in from a 1950s film set. The
performance began with an enigmatic (and unnecessarily long-winded mime,
Altoum appeared in a wheelchair, the male chorus periodically swarmed onto
the stage from trap-doors and the ending was pure Hollywood.
However you describe it - comic anarchy, an operatic Theatre of the Absurd -
the approach somehow made dramatic sense. Akina, a Hawaian who directs the
Berlin Chamber Opera, gave a sharp focus to the key confrontations and drew
strongly-characterised performances from everyone on stage.
After briefly doubling as Queen Mother of Samarkand in the opening scene,
Karen Huffstodt portrayed Turandot as a fiery, glamorous red-head, singing
with ample, steady tone. The elegant young Swedish tenor, Stefan Dahlberg,
gave an equally fearless performance as Calaf. In the bass role of Emperor
Altoum, Franz Hawlata delivered a brilliant cameo and sang beautifully.
Helene Perraguin was a rather pale Adelma, and Bruce Brewer no longer has
the voice for Truffaldino. The choral and orchestral contributions were
beyond criticism: Kent Nagano deserves credit above all for capturing the
exotic, energetic exhilaration of this chameleon-like score.
The new production of Benvenuto Cellini at Geneva's Grand Theatre will not
go down as one of the highlights of the season, but it was a courageous stab
at an impossible work. The challenge of Berlioz's rarely-staged first opera
lies in bridging the chasm between its intimate opera-comique origins and
its exalted ambition. The only unifying element is the music, a reckless
fireball of invention which demands virtuosity and flouts convention. Thanks
to an electrifying performance by the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande under
the eminent Berliozian John Nelson, the originality of the score could be
properly appreciated - its romantic colouring, its impatient energy, its
dazzling profusion of rhythm and cross-rhythm.
But the problems of dramatic structure and proportion remain, as Francesca
Zambello's production illustrated all too clearly. Her solution was to
explore a vein of comic satire running through the work, bathing it in the
visual atmosphere of renaissance Rome. It would certainly be hard to imagine
a wittier Cellini. The stage was framed in the theatrical parentheses of
commedia dell'arte, with a group of mimes discreetly oiling the wheels of
the plot. John Macfarlane's designs, imaginatively lit by Davy Cunningham,
included an ingenious trompe-l'oeil room of cloth walls and flaps for the
opening scenes, the farcical overtones of which were exploited to the full.
There was also a delicious air of mock seriousness about the papal
visitation in the final act.
What the staging lacked was convincing spectacle. The carnival, acted out
beneath a series of tall wooden gate-frames, was feebly animated and
unimpressively sung by the Geneva chorus. The final forging scene huffed and
puffed, but looked artificial. In the end, Zambello failed to resolve the
work's split personality - a Falstaffian love story belatedly recast as a
parable of heroic artistic struggle. It was hard to treat Cellini's final
burst of creativity as anything more than a joke.
The title role was elegantly sung by Chris Merritt, whose bright timbre and
high vocal extension brought out the music's Italianate charm. He is rare
among his tenor colleagues in never seeking to hog the limelight. But his
tubby, somewhat camp stage appearance robbed him of the romantic guise
necessary for the part. As Teresa, the Australian soprano Deborah Riedel
made a strong impression, singing with clear, expressive tone and acting
with a discreet twinkle in her eye. As the crusty old bureaucrat Balducci
and the hapless suitor Fieramosca, Jean-Philippe Courtis and Jeffrey Black
very nearly stole the show with their superbly-realised comic double-act.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Arts: Cruel master of martyrdoms / Review of the pitch dark
world of Jusepe de Ribera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Poussin's 'St Erasmus' the saint's entrails are slowly being winched out
of his stomach, but the sky is still blue and martyrdom seems no more
troublesome than a visit to the dentist. In Jusepe de Ribera the prospect of
death is not so agreeable. His saints inhabit an urgent, brutal and
pitch-dark world in which raking light is the only sign of salvation, and
colour is courtesy of burning coals and flayed flesh.
Counter Reformation art was fond of celebrating the sacrifices of the
saints, and gory mythologies were common in Renaissance art. In Ribera, as
in Titian and Rembrandt, what disturbs is that the protagonists are real
people. Ribera's executioners particularly relish their tasks. In his
'Martyrdom of St Bartholomew' the colluding grins of the executioners draw
one into the mob, which is stringing up the wasted body of the aged
Bartholomew, and into the terrifying confusion and crush where snatches of
action and disembodied faces loom out of the night. The painting is a tour
de force of unsettling diagonal rhythms and of sagging, dry and wrinkled
flesh produced by dragging a bristly brush through richly impasted pigment.
It is also informed by an unusual intelligence. Ribera has selected the
essential moment of bloodlust. Bartholomew has refused to worship the pagan
idol; as it falls to the floor the order is out for him to be flayed alive
and the henchmen are busy tying his legs with rope. As all torturers know,
the anticipation of what is to come is their most effective implement.
Caravaggio offers blood-and-guts violence; Ribera, his closest follower in
Naples, has an unmistakable strain of cruelty.
Was the savagery of his martyrdoms simply a relection of the violence of
life in 17th-century Naples, or an indication of a darker, essentially
Spanish psychology? Jusepe de Ribera, known as 'lo Spagnoletto' - the little
Spaniard - is a problematic artist in many ways. Born in Valencia, he lived
most of his adult life in Naples, then under the dominion of the Spanish
viceroys. His painting, however, is very much part of the Italian tradition.
Precious little is known of his early life or oeuvre, and the range and
virtuosity of his mature work is surprisingly unfamiliar to a general
public.
His relative neglect stems from the fact that he is either renegade or
foreigner to these national schools of painting. His reputation has suffered
too from the numerous copies and imitations of his work made during his
lifetime, and by the capacity of his vast, tenebrous narratives to defy
reproduction.
An opportunity for reappraisal comes at last in the form of an ambitious
all-embracing loan exhibition of paintings, drawings and etchings, conceived
to mark the 400th anniversary of his birth in 1591. Planned to open in
Madrid last October, it instead takes its first bow in the massive
16th-century Castel Sant'Elmo in Naples. The Prado show, which opens in May,
is designed to present the 'pure' Ribera to the Spaniards, drawing together
work primarily from Spanish religious foundations and collections. In
contrast, the Naples show includes school and attributed works which makes
it more experimental, contentious and, above all, thrilling.
Ribera unfolds along a sequence of the fortress's imposing stone vaulted
spaces, the pictures theatrically set against brilliant scarlet cloth. There
are peculiarities in chronology perhaps, and some unlikely candidates for
the hand of Ribera. Unevenness is also due to the spotlighting and to the
dramatically varying states of preservation (or lack of) and restoration of
the canvases.
Nonetheless, the impact of the scale and conception of Ribera at his best is
astounding. There is the compellingly grotesque 2.29m wide 'Drunken Silenus'
where the gross Silenus is lying surrounded by a motley band of horribly
naturalistic satyrs and the goat-horned Pan, and the blood-curdling Apollo
flaying Marsyas. Tityus and Prometheus, both in monstrous scale (their
poses, like that of St Bartholomew, derive from the Antique statue known as
the Dying Gaul) suffer agonies as their innards are torn out by an eagle and
a vulture.
From the Prado comes a great Trinity, a Martyrdom of St Philip and The Dream
of Jacob. Ribera has a startling gift of characterisation whether painting
saints or villains. Humanity is well observed and detail is ever convincing
(another St Bartholomew's assassin holds his knife between his teeth as he
uses both hands to tear flesh).
The show reveals that there is far more to Ribera than martyrdoms and
mythologies. It presents series of half-length Apostles and Philosophers,
and genres illustrating the five senses. There are a few splendid formal
portraits, such as the proudly bespectacled Knight of the Order of Santiago.
Perhaps more unexpected is the tenderness, pure colour and classical repose
of the majestic late 'Mystic Marriage of St Catherine'.
Ribera's elaborate signatures sought to make it clear that he was a Spaniard
rather than a native Neapolitan, his nationality encouraging lucrative
commissions from the ruling elite. By the 1620s he was in effect the arbiter
of taste in Naples. He worked for a succession of viceroys and for the
increasingly wealthy church. It was a position he had worked for and aimed
to maintain. Along with his friends he operated a sort of artistic Camorra
whereby no painter could work in Naples without their consent, and anyone
who proved too proficient was hounded from the city.
Guido Reni fled after his assistant was wounded in 1621, Domenichino was
tormented and finally died, his wife convinced that he had been poisoned.
Annibale Carracci was also reputed to have died as an indirect result of the
harassment of this cabal. When Stanzione painted a much admired Dead Christ
for the Certosa di San Martino, Ribera persuaded the monks to let him
lighten it and in so doing ruined it with corrosive liquid.
The clergy had no qualms about employing Caravaggio, a murderer, and any
number of artists who were known criminals or of ill-repute. There was no
correlation between sacred art and the piety of the patrons or painters.
It is tempting to see in Ribera's essentially Italian art a Spanish
predilection for horrific martyrdoms, oddities, and for a certain religious
sentiment. On the instruction of one of the viceroys, the Duca di Alcala,
Ribera painted his most extraordinary picture, a portrait of Magdalena
Ventura with her bemused husband and son. Nothing strange about that one
might say until one notices the Signora's long black beard.
Ribera's inscription tells us that she is 52, and was 37 when she 'began to
become hairy', and had borne three sons. The artist has made the image as
sensational as possible, depicting Magdalena nursing her child and exposing
a floppy brown breast of a kind never found in any Madonna.
The Naples venue has an additional advantage of the neighbouring Certosa di
San Martino, with its great Pieta by Ribera and series of newly restored
frescoes. There is also access to the Chapel of St Januarius in the
Cathedral. The show continues in Naples until March 12, the Spanish version
is at the Prado Museum in Madrid, May 30-August 25. A much reduced version
of that show goes to the Metropolitan Museum in New York, Septembre
16-November 22.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Arts: Today's Television
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
In its own insidious way British television is so 'politically correct' that
it is inconceivable anybody here could make (or, at any rate, screen) the
British equivalent of Married With Children. In this American sitcom you get
all the familiar permissable jokes about male vanity and men who can't keep
it up - but also jokes about female spongers and feminine scattiness. It is
in such contrast to the prevailing feminist dogma that you wonder how it
gets on British television at all. The answer is that it hardly does: just
in London (other ITV areas occasionally) and late at night; 11.15 today.
Earlier on BBC2 the politically correct shadow arts minister Mark Fisher and
architect Sir Richard Rogers (both keen Labour men) get 45 minutes on Open
Space to travel across London on top of a bus explaining how they could
improve everything with the firm smack of centralised planning.
If what you really want is a bit more about the ghastliness of men and the
universal victimisation of women you could try Episode 2 of Fay Weldon's
serial Growing Rich featuring that typical male, the devil (9.00 ITV), or
the first in a new series of Roseanne, with its fat, foul-mouthed heroine
(10.00 C4).

FT  06 MAR 92 / Technology: Chip's a fast-talker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are few things more irritating than the android-like digitised voices
that are used to give machine instructions. But until recently the only
other way of recording and repeating a message has been the traditional
audio tape.
Now a digital rival has come along which enables conversation or music to be
recorded in its original analogue form. The big advantage of this chip is
that it gives excellent voice reproduction, says Karen Moores, product
manager at Sequoia Semiconductor, the Reading-based distributor.
And, say the companies that are using it, the chip, developed by Information
Storage Devices, of San Jose, California, could find its way into everything
from answering machines and mobile phones to talking dolls and even a
talking scarecrow.
London-based Voice Messaging Systems, for example, launched a package in
January which has been incorporated, among other applications, in fire and
security devices. Instead of just sounding an alarm, the chip can advise on
the quickest route to a fire exit.
Since the chip can be incorporated in packages as small as a luggage tag, it
could be used to label suitcases with the traveller's name, flight number
and destination, says Michael Hurlow, marketing and technical director of
Voice Messaging Systems.
When the next holiday comes around the traveller records over the last
message by pressing a button - in the same way as recording on to a
cassette. Each chip can take up to 100,000 re-recordings.
Ironically, while the rest of the world is replacing analogue technology
with modern digital techniques, the production of the analogue chip taxed
the skills of engineers for years. Some even said it was impossible to
produce.
The difficult lies in storing a correct representation of the sound. With
digital storage just a '0' or a '1' is required - represented by the
presence or absence of an electrical pulse. ISD's chip, on the other hand,
has to hold the information at varying levels between 0 and 2.5 volts.
The trick, says Hurlow, is not only to store the sound but to be able to
repeat it, and that involves precision in the chip's clock. 'If you get a
drift in the clock you can sound very tired or very elated.' Limitations of
the chip at the moment are that it can only store a maximum of 20 seconds of
speech. But by the end of the year ISD will be selling a 75-second device,
says Steve Stephansen, vice president of marketing and sales.

THE use of CFCs in manufacturing is acknowledged to be one of the prime
causes of ozone 'holes' in the stratosphere, and many governments have drawn
up schedules for their elimination.
Thermo Electron Technologies of San Diego, California, has developed a
miniaturised thermoelectric cooling module which employs semiconductor
elements in place of CFCs. These are sturdier than conventional cooling
units.
Potential uses include cooling electronic components in aircraft, air
conditioning systems in cars and producing slimmer wall-mounted air
conditioners for homes.
Meanwhile, NEC of Japan has developed a new technology which aids the
examination of integrated circuit (IC) print boards for organic residues
after they have been washed with substitutes for traditionally-used CFCs.
NEC claims its technology, which uses filtered light from a mercury lamp, is
simpler, quicker and more accurate than earlier alternatives and should
contribute towards the evaluation of CFC substitutes in IC production.

TWENTY-FIVE years ago the now ubiquitous plain paper copier was in its
infancy. Most offices used a stencil machine to run off multiple copies of
documents.
Now a distant descendant of the humble stencil duplicator, called a digital
duplicator, is poised to challenge the copier's supremacy. The digital
duplicator is a blend of old and new technologies. It uses a stencil master
image produced using scanning technology similar to a fax machine.
The result is a single compact unit in which the original is fed in one end
and copies emerge from the other - just like a copier, but with an output of
130 copies per minute it rivals all but the fastest copiers which cost much
more.
The quality of digital duplicating is now equal to, if not better than, that
of a copier, and, like its predecessor, produces high-volume copies
(anything in excess of 15-20 copies) at a low cost.
Riso Kagaku of Japan, which pioneered digital duplicating, has launched a
series of models costing less than Pounds 10,000 which will also take input
direct from a desktop PC or Apple Mac.

WHEN a train goes round a curve the wheel flanges, which help hold the train
on the track, get worn and typically need refurbishing every eight to 12
months.
Denco, the British lubrication specialist, has devised a technique which
extends the lives of rail-wheel flanges by a factor of three or four.
The electronically controlled system, developed in conjunction with British
Rail, is fitted to the train and automatically sprays a measured amount of
weather-resistant lubricant on to precise points on the flanges of both
front and rear bogies.
For environmental reasons the amount of lubricant sprayed each time is very
small, limiting the spread of oil from the wheel flange to wheel tread. With
a typical distance of 200m between spray operations a train can run for
200,000 kilometres before the 6.5-litre oil reservoir need replenishing.
British Rail, which hopes to save thousands of pounds a year using the
system, has placed an initial order for 30 customised sets. A bonus is that
the intrusive squeal from dry wheels running on tight curves should be
eliminated, and track wear should be reduced.

FT  06 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: Director's disqualification case can go ahead
late
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIAL RECEIVER v NIXON
Court of Appeal (Lord Donaldson, Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Balcombe
and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith): February 11 1992
LEAVE WILL be granted to apply out of time for a director's disqualification
order if the court is satisfied there is an arguable case for
disqualification, provided there is adequate explanation for the delay and
it has not prejudiced the person against whom the order is sought. And if
there is a question as to whether that person was in fact a director, it is
sufficient for extension of time purposes that the evidence, taking all
factors together, shows a fairly arguable case that he was a director or
shadow director, in that he controlled the company's affairs beyond the
province of a professional adviser.
The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by Mr David Henry
Nixon, from Mr Justice Vinelott's decision upholding leave granted by the
County Court to the Official Receiver to apply out of time for an order
disqualifying Mr Nixon from acting as a company director.
LORD JUSTICE BALCOMBE said that the Official Receiver had been given leave
to apply out of time for a disqualifying order against Mr Nixon.
Section 7(1) of the Company Directors' Disqualification Act 1986 provided
that the Official Receiver might apply for a disqualification order against
a 'director' of a company being wound up by the court.
Section 2 provided that an application for a disqualification order should
not be made after two years from when the company 'became insolvent', except
with leave of the court.
Tasbian Ltd, an electronics company, started trading in 1982. It was largely
financed by Castle Finance Ltd.
Castle lent Tasbian Pounds 400,000 secured by a debenture. Midland Bank
granted it a Pounds 50,000 overdraft facility, and Barclays Bank lent a
further Pounds 610,000 secured by debenture.
Tasbian made losses in every accounting period to the end of 1985.
In September 1985, Castle introduced Mr Nixon, a chartered accountant and
experienced company doctor. He was to report to Castle on Tasbian's
financial position and advise on and help its recovery. He was also
appointed consultant to Tasbian.
On November 1 1985, he reported to the directors after which a decision was
made to trade out of Tasbian's difficulties. A moratorium of creditors was
proposed, and Castle agreed to subscribe an additional Pounds 400,000 share
capital.
Sometime after February 1986, Tasbian employees were transferred to a shell
company called Hartbrook Manpower Services, which had no other business and
no source of income except payments from Tasbian for the employees'
services. It incurred large NIC and PAYE liabilities.
Negotiations for the take-over of Tasbian by another company foundered.
Tasbian's fate was then sealed. On September 24 and 30 Barclays and Castle
respectively appointed joint receivers and managers.
Mr Nixon had resigned as consultant shortly before the receivers were
appointed.
As at September 24 1986, there were unsecured liabilities of Pounds 1.54m,
leaving a deficiency of Pounds 1.39m.
The Official Receiver's charges against Mr Nixon were (a) that he failed to
ensure that accounts were prepared and delivered in compliance with section
241 of the Companies Act 1985, and to see that the statutory register of
members was properly maintained; (b) that he caused Tasbian to trade while
insolvent; and (c) that he caused Tasbian to operate a policy of non-payment
of Crown monies.
A winding-up order was made on November 10 1986. On December 12, Mr Nixon
had a motor accident but was back at work by January 5 1987. In July 1987,
he was in contact with the Official Receiver, and made a statement to his
examiner on June 2 1988.
Section 6(2) of the 1986 Act provided that for the purposes of sections 6
and 7 a company became 'insolvent' if it went into liquidation when its
assets were insufficient to pay its debts, or if '(c) an administrative
receiver of the company is appointed'.
The question arose whether time under section 7(2), which was two years from
when the company 'became insolvent', ran from appointment of administrative
receivers on September 24 1986, or from the winding up order on November 10
1986.
That issue had been decided in the Court of Appeal in favour of Mr Nixon.
The remaining question was whether the Official Receiver should have been
given leave to apply out of time.
On the appeal, Mr Bannister for Mr Nixon argued first, that there was not
sufficient evidence that he was a 'director' or 'shadow director'.
On an application for leave to bring proceedings under section 7 out of
time, the test was the same as that used on any application for leave to
take some initiating procedure out of time.
If the court was satisfied that the evidence showed a fairly arguable case
on the applicant's part, then on that ground alone, leaving aside the
reasons for the delay and any questions of prejudice to the other party, it
would not refuse leave.
In section 22(4) 'director' was defined as including a shadow director. By
section 22(5) 'shadow director' meant 'a person in accordance with whose
directions or instructions the directors of the company are accustomed to
act . . .'
The matters relied on by the Official Receiver to substantiate his case that
Mr Nixon was a shadow or de facto director were that he was appointed and
paid by Tasbian; he negotiated an informal moratorium with creditors; he
monitored trading and assisted the board; in particular, he negotiated with
the DTI and Inland Revenue; he became a signatory on Tasbian's bank account;
he advised on the transfer of the labour force to Hartbrook; and most of the
directors regarded him as a shadow director.
Some of the matters on which the Official Receiver relied, taken by
themselves, were of little weight, for example negotiating a moratorium with
creditors. But others were much more significant - in particular the
allegation that Mr Nixon monitored Tasbian's trading, and controlled its
bank account; and the Hartbrook hive-down, which Mr Nixon advised and in
implementation of which he assisted.
The evidence disclosed a sufficiently arguable case that Mr Nixon was either
a shadow or de facto director.
Mr Bannister's second argument was that there was insufficient explanation
for the Official Receiver's failure to commence proceedings within time.
In considering an application for leave to commence disqualification
proceedings out of time, the court should take into account (1) the length
of delay; (2) the reasons for delay; (3) the strength of the case against a
director; and (4) the degree of prejudice caused to him by the delay
(Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Desai, CA, November 29 1991).
The Official Receiver said the application was not late by reference to two
years from date of winding-up, but only by reference to two years from date
of the administrative receivership, and the application was made to
regularise what might otherwise be regarded as an out-of-time application.
Also he said, difficulty was experienced in interviewing Mr Nixon because of
the car accident 'and it was not until May 1988 that contact was made'.
That last passage was inaccurate.
The Official Receiver's misunderstanding of the law was not of itself
unreasonable. Against the background of his belief that he had two years
from the winding up to make his application, sufficient explanation for the
delay had been given.
With regard to the inaccuracies, this was public interest litigation. If Mr
Nixon had really behaved so as to render him unfit to be a director, it
would not be right to prelude trial of that question merely because the
Official Receiver had been inaccurate in certain facts.
The appeal was dismissed. Their Lordships agreed.
For Mr Nixon: Edward Bannister QC (Jude Sykes &amp; Harrison).
For the Official Receiver: Philip Heslop QC and Jonathan Crow (Treasury
Solicitor).

FT  06 MAR 92 / Management: Hospitals get the quality treatment / A look at
magic moments in America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN RANDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mike Matzinger, a paramedic, entered the hospital ward carrying a shopping
bag. He was visiting a boy knocked down by a car the previous day whose
school uniform Matzinger had cut during treatment. The paramedic had just
gone out on his day off work and bought a replacement set.
The incident at Williamsport Hospital in Pennsylvania is one of 1,000 'magic
moments' listed by the hospital as the result of its six-year Total Quality
Management programme. Williamsport is a pioneer, but is far from alone in
trying to apply TQM in a health setting.
In the last two years, American health managers have become fascinated by
quality. It now takes second place only to cost containment in a country
where 13 per cent of the gross national product is spent on an largely
insurance-based health care system.
TQM can create big financial savings. Research has indicated that companies
often spend between 25 and 30 per cent of operating budgets rectifying
errors in the production process. Exponents of TQM claim it can save about
half of those costs by getting things right first time.
The whole notion of quality has a particular significance in medicine. Cars
built with defects may be re-worked, but patients who are treated wrongly
will suffer unnecessarily and may not recover at all.
So far, most health care improvements have been administrative. A team of
physicians and managers halved the number of unavailable out-patient records
at the Walnut Creek Medical Center in California by using problem solving
techniques, common in industrial engineering.
Similar successes were reported in an eight-month national demonstration
project. The project matched 21 experts in quality management from
corporations, universities, and consulting firms with management teams from
health organisations.
Each team selected a problem area at their workplace and applied a TQM
solution. The problems included telephone response times, transfer of data
between sites and improved billing; none covered clinical subjects, or broad
corporate change.
After six years of the TQM programme at the Williamsport Hospital, Donald
Creamer, chief executive and president, can produce a list of ment teams' as
part of the hospital's 'Making People Well and Happy' campaign. They
include:
Raising the rate of improvement in post-heart attack patients undergoing
rehabilitation from 66 to 80 per cent.
Achieving significantly lower mortality rates than other hospitals with the
same mix of patients.
Responding to parents' wishes not to be parted from their children before
they are anaesthetised for operations.
Timothy Manello, the hospital's vice president for human resources, says the
programme has depended on involving and looking after staff. There is an
extensive programme of staff training and rewards designed to inculcate
values and standards in all employees.
Apart from monthly awards, the two employees of the year receive Dollars
500, a silver tray and a week's family holiday in Florida.
Another hospital with interesting results is the Department of Veterans
Affairs Hospital in Kansas City. Managers claim that since the introduction
of a Quality Management Programme, they have cut the number of deaths in the
hospital by 20 per cent.
The hospital has a small team of specialist nurses who monitor 15 types of
untoward incidents, including all in-patient deaths. After the team
presented results to physicians and ward teams, clinical and administrative
policies were changed.
These American experiments have lessons for Britain. The National Health
Service Management Executive has invested Pounds 2.5m over the last three
years in supporting local TQM initiatives. This financial year, 12 sites
have shared Pounds 1m.
The projects are now being examined by a team from Brunel University, and
early evidence suggests that the NHS experience compares well with the US.
In my own health district of Worthing in Sussex, some tangible results have
been achieved:
At Shoreham Health Centre, doctors, nurses, receptionists and the caretaker
worked together to improve patient waiting areas, signposting and access to
the premises.
At Worthing Hospital, the porters were issued with walkie talkies to improve
response times.
The ambulance service introduced radio-cassettes to entertain patients
travelling to out-patients' wards.
But despite the hopeful evidence from both sides of the Atlantic, there are
some important questions to be answered before the case for TQM in health is
fully made.
The first is whether TQM can be transported from the private sector into the
public sector.
There seems little reason to think that the main thrust of the approach
cannot be transferred, but there are harder questions about its techniques
for involving staff.
One of the exciting components of TQM is the idea of encouraging staff to
take responsibility: this approach can cut across the bureaucratic style of
public services.
Trust hospitals now have a clear interest in delivering the services
required by customers - purchasing health authorities and fund-holding
general practitioners. They also have more freedom to devise their own staff
reward packages to encourage quality.
A bigger unknown is whether TQM can be applied to clinical areas. The
evidence from the US is so far unconvincing. In theory, there should be no
problem. The systematic, disciplined method at the heart of the TQM reflects
the clinical approach of doctors.
However, doctors may resist because they see it as a cunning way for
management to become involved in monitoring the work of doctors.
Alternatively, they may regard participation in problem-solving teams as a
waste of time or fail to see that many unsatisfactory clinical outcomes stem
from system failures.
A further set of questions surrounds the problem of defining quality in
health care. Is quality to be judged by compliance to agreed procedures? Or
is it by the condition of the patient on discharge? Or is a longer term view
of the outcome for the patient necessary? And what part should the patient's
experience in hospital play in judging quality?
In the industrial setting some of these questions can be answered by asking
the customers to rank quality components. In many cases, this is not so easy
in the health setting.
Despite these difficulties, the potential prizes to be reaped from TQM make
it well worth exploring on a more serious basis in the NHS. If it works
well, it could result in big improvements of the sort witnessed in
successful Japanese and American companies.
At a minimum, it could result in more medical records being found and some
telephones being answered more quickly. Small gains like that should not be
dismissed lightly.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Securities dealer is jailed for fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN AUTHORISED securities dealer who misused clients' funds to prop his
business was jailed yesterday for 2 1/2 years and disqualified from acting
as a company director for five years.
Sentencing Mr Andrew Kimmins at Southwark Crown Court in London, Judge
Anwyl-Davies said: 'It is vital that the public should know that those who
provide financial services are of unquestioned integrity.'
He told Mr Kimmins: 'Your pride would not allow you to acknowledge the
failure for which you were responsible, which drove you to dishonesty with
disastrous results for your clients.'
The judge said the loss to clients had been Pounds 3.5m and a further Pounds
500,000 had been lost by Mr Kimmins's family and associates. He accepted
that Mr Kimmins's dishonesty had not been directed towards his own
enrichment.
Mr Kimmins had pleaded guilty to two charges of fraudulent trading. They
alleged that between November 1986 and December 1988 he was knowingly party
to the carrying on of the businesses of Blade Securities and Blade
Investments, both of Brompton Road, London, with intent to defraud
creditors. Twenty-three other charges were left on the court file.
The judge said Mr Kimmins had signally failed to exercise proper control of
the Blade group, of which he was the chairman, managing director and
majority shareholder.
Through his lack of control, inexperience, bad judgment of people and
unjustified optimism, he had incurred appreciable Stock Exchange losses and
very substantial personal debts.
In mid-1987 Blade Corporation and Blade Securities had been insolvent, the
judge said, but Mr Kimmins had continued to trade, using clients' money to
pay trading debts.
From the end of 1987 there had been no real commercial prospect of money
being available to meet the companies' obligations but Mr Kimmins had
continued to imperil clients' interests by carrying on trading.
In 1988, when authorisation had been needed, he had formed Blade Investments
but had given the Securities Association misleading information about the
debts of Blade Corporation and Blade Securities.
Mr Kimmins's serious breaches of trust, business practice and procedure had
been aggravated by his failure to heed the lessons of the past and the
warnings of accountants, the judge said. His efforts to remedy the wrongs
for his clients had been 'a forlorn venture'.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Accounting guidelines planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCOUNTING treatment of post-retirement benefits other than pensions is
to be scrutinised by the Accounting Standards Board. The board will also
examine reclassifications between fixed and current assets.
The urgent issues task force of the ASB, the UK accounting standards body,
is expected to produce guidelines on these issues by summer. They would
apply until superseded by the more detailed financial reporting standards
being drafted by the ASB.
Members of the task force will consider whether SSAP 24, the existing
guidelines on treatment of pensions, should cover other benefits, such as
private medical care.
The amount at which transfers should be made between current and fixed
assets when revaluations take place will be discussed.
Members are also considering the presentation of long-term debtors in
current assets, and the accounting treatment of low-start finance.
The task force, which was launched last year, has already issued guidelines
on the treatment of goodwill on acquisition, restructuring costs and premium
put options.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Occupational pension funds show average 16.9% return for
1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OCCUPATIONAL pension funds achieved an average rate of return (income plus
capital appreciation) of 16.9 per cent last year, according to the WM
Company, the bigger of the two main performance measurers.
Excluding property, which had a bad year, the funds returned 18.8 per cent.
All the other main categories of investments, UK equities, overseas
equities, UK bonds and overseas bonds, returned between 18 per cent and 21
per cent.
The average return achieved by fund managers in UK equities was 20.0 per
cent, compared with the 20.7 per cent theoretically obtainable on the
FT-Actuaries All-Share Index.
Overseas equity portfolios returned 20.9 per cent compared with 23.7 per
cent on the FT-Actuaries World ex UK Index.
The figures reflect more than 2,000 funds worth Pounds 240bn in aggregate.
WM reports that, as in 1990, companies last year took more out of their
pension funds than was received through investment income and employees'
contributions.
This reflects the continued prevalence of fund surpluses and employers'
contribution holidays.
Total holdings of equities - UK and overseas - reached an all-time high of
77 per cent last year, and was even higher for smaller funds. Cash holdings
fell sharply. Exposure to UK bonds and property also fell.
In the past five years, in spite of the stock market crash of 1987 and a
negative-return year in 1990, pension funds have returned 9.9 per cent a
year on average, comfortably ahead of inflation of 6.4 per cent and slightly
ahead of average earnings growth of 8.8 per cent.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Attack on 'misleading' holiday brochures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S biggest holiday companies are producing misleading brochures two
years after the Association of British Travel Agents introduced a code of
practice on the subject, according to a study by Holiday Which? magazine.
Thomson, the UK's biggest tour operator, described Faliraki on Rhodes as a
former fishing village which had retained its traditional atmosphere.
Holiday Which? said it was 'really a sprawling, Costa-style resort with
high-rise hotels, masses of souvenir shops, fast-food joints and loud music
blaring from bars.'
Enterprise, part of Owners Abroad, the second biggest holiday company, told
potential visitors to some apartments that shops, tavernas and nightspots
were within easy reach. In fact it was half a mile's walk to the nearest,
solitary bar.
Airtours, the third biggest operator, published a brochure with a picture of
a beach on the same page as a description of a hotel. Holiday Which? found
that the beach was 12 miles from the hotel.
The magazine found examples of brochures issued by other operators which
contained photographs taken in such a way as to hide unsightly features
including incomplete building work.
Under a European Community directive on package holidays which takes effect
at the beginning of next year it will be an offence for tour organisers or
travel agents to supply misleading or incomplete brochures.
Abta said its 1990 code had resulted in a 60 per cent decrease in complaints
about misleading brochures. Mr John Dunscombe, Abta's president, said:
'Travel brochures should be totally transparent. Whilst holidays are made of
dreams, we must ensure that these dreams are actually attainable.'
The quality of holiday ferries ranges from filthy facilities and poor
service to elegant comfort, Holiday Which? said. Ferries operated by P&amp;O and
by Sealink Stena featured among those praised as well as among those
condemned.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Parties clash over waiting list
figures - Health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO main parties traded assertions about health service activity
yesterday, as a record fall in the number of people waiting more than two
years for an operation was announced yesterday by Mr William Waldegrave, the
health secretary.
The tension between the parties on the issue was reflected in another rowdy
and fevered bout of pre-election sniping at prime minister's questions in
the Commons.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, attacked Mr John Major for ignoring
complaints by cancer specialists that they were 'unable to treat patients
because of shortage of beds', while Mr Major again insisted that the
government had exceeded the sums suggested by Labour spokesmen when
providing more resources for the NHS.
In a speech to the conference of NHS managers, Mr Waldegrave said that a
second wave of family doctors would become GP fundholders from the beginning
of April, bringing the total in the scheme to more than 3,000 GPs.
He clashed with Mr Robin Cook, the shadow health secretary, over the number
of people treated by the NHS since the reforms came into effect.
Mr Waldegrave said that the first months of government reforms showed the
health service on course to treat 5.6 per cent more acute in-patients than
last year. But Mr Cook said claims of more patient care did not square with
information sent to him by regional health authorities.
There are now just over 20,000 patients waiting more than than two years for
an operation - a reduction of nearly 9,000 since last December.
As part of the Citizen's Charter initiative, the government has set the
target that, from April, no-one should have to wait longer than two years.
Mr Waldegrave conceded that the number of patients waiting for up to a year
had risen, but said that the number waiting more than one year had almost
halved.
At a press conference with doctors who oppose the government's health
reforms, Mr Cook said that the real figures showed that on present progress
the NHS would treat 7.45m patients this year, not the 7.9m patients claimed
by ministers.
In the Commons Mr Kinnock had to struggle to make himself heard above
persistent barracking from Conservative MPs. 'I am telling the truth about
the NHS, and they do not want to hear it,' he protested.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Marginal seats are targeted -
Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR candidates in marginal Tory-held seats are being urged to stress
their backing for a change in Britain's voting system to win crucial
floating voters, the party's electoral reform lobby revealed yesterday.
The Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform (LCER) said such a move would be
crucial in winning vital votes from the Liberal Democrats - the only party
openly committed to proportional representation for the House of Commons.
While LCER did not expect the party's manifesto to do more than repeat its
openness to change, campaign leaders insisted that reminding the electorate
of Labour's new stance would help the leadership pave the way to a national
debate after an election victory. They said LCER would press candidates to
use election leaflets to underline that Labour's working party on electoral
systems would report soon after the election. They recalled that there were
already commitments for new voting methods for a Scottish parliament and a
Greater London authority.
Mr Jeff Rooker, LCER chairman, said: 'Labour candidates across the country
will be well advised to ensure they signal their support at this and every
opportunity.'
His call was backed by Mr Huw Edwards, MP for Monmouth, who used public
support for reform to rebuff a Liberal Democrat challenge at the by-election
last year.
Other electoral reform lobbyists are also gearing up their preparations for
highlighting the issue during the campaign. The Electoral Reform Society
plans to release computer calculations on how the 1987 election might have
been influenced by other voting systems.
The Charter 88 lobby group is planning a 'Democracy Day' the Thursday before
polling, intended to put a critical spotlight on the current
first-past-the-post method.
The aim is to persuade candidates of all the main parties in some 100 seats
to participate in public debates on the issue as the election campaign draws
to its climax.
The poll tax is the single cause given most often by former Tory voters as
the reason for their defection, according to an opinion poll in the 50 most
marginal Tory seats.
The NOP survey shows Labour in a five point lead over the Tories - on 43 and
38 per cent respectively. The Liberal Democrats were up on 18 per cent. It
was carried our for today's Local Government Chronicle and BBC television's
Public Eye.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Companies face claims on assigned leases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY COMPANIES will face rent bills for offices they abandoned long ago if
they assigned their leases to businesses which later failed, according to
Lambert Smith Hampton, the firm of chartered surveyors.
It says landlords can claw back rents and costs at current prices from
previous lessees, even though many years have elapsed since they assigned
the lease.
Mr Tom Marshall, who heads Lambert's Manchester operations, says companies
in the south-east are in much greater danger because of the surge in rents
in the latter half of the 1980s.
Typical leases are for 25 years, and most landlords are institutions which
base rents on assumptions of yield from nearly continuous tenancy.
Mr Marshall cites a company which took a 25-year lease on 12,000 sq ft of
offices in central London in 1974 at Pounds 12.50 per sq ft. It assigned
this 10 years later to a profitable company which could afford a reviewed
rent of Pounds 40, which rose to Pounds 62.50 in 1989.
The assignee failed last year so the landlord, an insurance company, sent
its rent demand to the original lessee, which was still liable. Lambert said
the company could face costs of nearly Pounds 4m, involving two years of
being stuck with the offices - with no prospect of letting in the recession
and eventually having to let at half-price because the market has fallen.
The issue may be complicated by many companies having changed most of their
staff, moved several times, changed accountants or lawyers, or having merged
or been taken over. Lambert Smith Hampton is starting a centralised storage
and retrieval system for leases to identify rental and other liabilities in
the event of the failure of the tenant.
It points out that a consequence of more companies becoming aware of the
problem could be that balance sheets might look less healthy because
contingent liabilities would have to be declared and provided for.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Businesses join opportunities campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING companies in the west Midlands are joining Birmingham Training and
Enterprise Council in a scheme to promote equal employment opportunities.
The scheme, believed to be the first of its type, involves a 'health check'
questionnaire designed to provide an assessment of a company's
equal-opportunities policy and a means of identifying measures that could
help the disadvantaged.
Birmingham Tec has budgeted an initial Pounds 150,000 to help companies that
wish to collaborate on equal-opportunity measures to help employment
prospects.
In Birmingham about 25 per cent of the population comes from ethnic
minorities and a further 12 per cent has some form of disability.
Unemployment among these groups tends to be higher than the average rate. At
the same time there is recognition of the low proportion of women in
management positions.
The origins of the 'health check' scheme can be traced to informal talks
that started three years ago - before the Tec was established - among 10
companies including Cadbury and Rover Cars.
The informal group has expanded to 40 organisations including British Rail,
the BBC, Central TV, Leyland DAF, Lucas, Midland Bank, Midland Electricity,
Royal Mail, J. Sainsbury, Tesco, TSB Bank, West Midlands Gas and WM Travel.
Ashley Ashwood More than 1,000 prison workers converged on Parliament
yesterday to protest against plans to privatise jails. Britain's first
private prison, the Wolds remand centre in Humberside, is due to open next
month.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Optimism on Budget from film industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FILM INDUSTRY is optimistic that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will
announce a tax concession in the Budget on Tuesday to help film production.
Mr Lamont said in last year's Budget that he had studied proposals for tax
concessions but could not accept them. He held the door slightly ajar,
however, suggesting he would be prepared to consider further proposals.
Since then there have been detailed discussions between representatives of
the film industry and the Inland Revenue on possible changes to the rules on
writing off spending on films.
The industry wants accelerated write-offs so that money invested in a film
can be written off when the expenditure actually occurs. There are often
cashflow difficulties in film production because money is usually spent long
before the film is released and starts to repay its investment.
The industry is pinning its hopes on changes to the rules on accelerated
write-offs because that is the main potential concession for which
implications have been explored in detail.
Lord Reay, the Department of Trade and Industry minister responsible for the
film industry, yesterday praised the skills and talent of British film
makers wherever they worked. He said the UK film industry had shown in the
past 18 months that it was 'not nearly as dead as it is claimed to be'.
The minister said he could not comment on specific issues so close to the
Budget, but he appeared to rule out subsidies which would, he said, merely
distort the market.
Earlier this week the Labour Party unveiled a series of proposals for the
film industry, including the launching of a film initiative to increase
investment in British films and the creation of a film investment scheme.
That would provide a framework of fiscal measures to encourage and promote
private investment.

TRUCK DRIVERS are by far the worst offenders when it comes to breaking speed
limits on roads other than motorways, according to figures published by the
Department of Transport yesterday.
Spot checks using electronic detectors showed 78 per cent of the heaviest
trucks exceeding the 50 mph limit on dual carriageways and 72 per cent
exceeding the 40 mph limit on single carriageways.
On motorways, 45 per cent of the heaviest trucks exceeded their 60 mph
limit. But car drivers were worse offenders, with 60 per cent breaking the
70 mph limit.
The most law-abiding were drivers of buses and coaches, 19 per cent of whom
broke their 70 mph limit on motorways and 29 per cent of whom broke their 60
mph limit on dual carriageways. Off the motorways, 38 per cent of car
drivers broke the 70 mph speed limit on dual carriageways and 10 per cent
broke the 60 mph limit on single carriageways. The Scottish Office yesterday
approved Pounds 330m worth of construction starts for major roads projects
in Scotland. They include further work on upgrading the A74 Glasgow-Carlisle
route to motorway and improvements to the M8 Glasgow-Edinburgh motorway near
Edinburgh and in Lanarkshire.

THE continuing impasse over cuts in farm trade subsidies in the Uruguay
Round of trade liberalisation talks has delayed detailed market access
negotiations which will form a vital ingredient of the final package.
By yesterday, four days after the March 1 deadline, only a dozen or so
participants (including the EC) had submitted detailed draft tariff
schedules, and those of the major traders contain important omissions. The
draft schedules are meant to provide the basis for final adjustments of
tariff cuts for each country, with an overall target reduction of one-third,
by the end of this month.
Many officials in Geneva now say privately that meeting the Easter deadline
for completion of the Uruguay Round in its entirety looks increasingly
improbable, if not impossible.
The US and the EC, by mutual agreement, have not included industrial tariffs
in their schedules because they are still in the midst of intensive and
sensitive bilateral negotiations, especially on textiles and sectors to be
covered by 'zero-for-zero' deals. Some other countries have decided to wait
for the outcome of those negotiations before tabling their own industrial
tariff schedules.
But the main problems still concern agriculture. The EC has provided
information on current agricultural protection, including tariff equivalents
for items now subject to import quotas and variable levies. But it has not
proposed reductions in agricultural trade barriers because the EC is
challenging the draft agricultural accord presented last December by Mr
Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt).
Japan, Canada and South Korea, among others, have refused to provide tariff
equivalents for farm imports now protected by quantitative restraints, as
required by the Dunkel draft.

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S rapid and far-reaching economic reform programme won praise
yesterday from trading partners and from Gatt, reports Frances Williams from
Geneva.
A report by Gatt economists on Argentina's trade policies says the reforms
have transformed the country in a few years 'from one of the most cosseted
economies in the world to one of the more open', with gratifying results in
low inflation, economic growth, return of flight capital and rising exports.
At yesterday's debate on the report by Gatt's governing council, Argentina
was described as 'a model' for rich and poor countries alike.
The Gatt report, says Argentina has virtually eliminated quantitative import
restrictions, which in 1986 covered half domestic production.
Average tariffs have dropped from 40 per cent to 12 per cent over the same
period, export taxes have fallen substantially and the government's policies
of deregulation and privatisation have increased competition and opened up
major opportunities for foreign direct investment.
High protection in the car and electronics sectors remains a concern but car
import restraints are due to begin being phased out in 1994.

</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR millions of personal computer (PC) users around the world, turning on
the familiar desktop machine this morning could be a moment of truth. Today,
the widely feared Michelangelo computer virus is set to strike, wiping out
data files on infected computers.
The level of concern over Michelangelo, however, varies from country to
country and seems to be proportional to the amount of interest the media is
taking in its destructive potential. Michelangelo fever is widespread in the
US and Germany but in the UK concern is muted.
Mr John McIntosh of PC Security, a consultancy specialising in antivirus
software, played down the risks in the UK, saying he expected a few victims
today but not a flood. The level of infection was about equal, he thought,
to the notorious 'Friday the 13th' virus which wiped out records at the
National Institute for the Blind last year but little other damage. There
can be little cause for complacency, however. Viruses have caused damage -
in time and trade lost - measured in six figures.
Those who have yet to take precautions against Michelangelo face the choice
of risking the destruction of files stored on their computer hard disks, or
giving up for 24 hours an essential business tool. Only when the computer is
turned on can the virus be activated. Michelangelo is triggered by the
'clock' inside a personal computer.
It is set to attack today, on the anniversary of the Italian Renaissance
artist's birth. In the US, many corporations, universities and government
agencies have taken the precaution of ordering employees to protect their
computer data by scanning IBM-compatible personal computers with special
programs designed to detect and eradicate the virus.
Although the source of this computer scourge remains a mystery, it is the
latest in an epidemic of rogue computer programs created by computer hackers
that are spreading from one computer to another, primarily via shared
'floppy disks'.
Those personal computer users who avoid Michelangelo face another virus
scare next Friday the 13th. Only by regularly scanning personal computers
for virus infections with the latest versions of anti-viral programs can
users be sure of avoiding the scourge, according to computer security
experts.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Four African states offer deal if ivory ban relaxed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSOM

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE southern African governments pushing for a relaxation of the world ivory
trade ban announced yesterday that they would drop demands for export
permission now if granted more control over their elephant herds, writes
Robert Thomsom in Tokyo.
A joint statement by the governments of Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana and
Malawi at the triennial conference of the Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species (Cites) in Kyoto was made as it became clear that a
majority of the 114 member states opposed a lifting of the ivory ban.
The ivory issue is one of the most emotional at the two-week conference,
which will also toughen or relax protection of a wide range of other flora
and fauna, and attempt to set clearer standards for assessing whether a
particular species is endangered.
Instead of a total ban on ivory trade, the four governments want a
'voluntary moratorium' for a 'reasonable period.'
They asked for 'time to put in place a trading system that would not
encourage any illegal opportunities for ivory trading,' but made clear that
they expected a limited trade to be legalised in the longer term.
Dr Simon Lyster, international treaties officer for the World Wide Fund for
Nature (WWF), said the four countries are moving 'in the right direction,'
but that the WWF is concerned by the proposal for a voluntary moratorium on
the ivory trade.
'WWF wants an ivory ban guaranteed by Cites and which can only be changed
with the consent of two-thirds of the parties to Cities,' he said.
A vote on whether to relax controls on elephants is likely early next week,
and many delegates to the conference have yet to make clear whether they
will vote in favour of allowing trade in elephant skins and meat. The four
governments argue that they should at least be allowed to trade in non-ivory
products.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S military government yesterday delayed implementation of a 30 per
cent devaluation scheduled to come into effect on Wednesday afternoon,
deepening the uncertainty about Nigeria's exchange rate policy.
The wide gap between official and parallel exchange rate is disturbing
Nigerians and external creditors alike, and undermining the country's
structural adjustment programme with the International Monetary Fund.
Although the Nigerian central bank paved the way for a devaluation of around
30 per cent on Wednesday, the announcement has been held up as President
Ibrahim Babangida continues to discuss the implications of the move with
senior advisers in Abuja, the new federal capital in central Nigeria.
The president is due to meet a visiting delegation from the IMF next week.
It is expected to tell him that a renewal of the country's lapsed standby
agreement with the Fund is partly dependent on the government's efforts to
close the gap between the official rate for the naira, trading at 10.50 to
the US dollar, and the parallel market which offers 18.
A new agreement is a precondition to the rescheduling of Nigeria's Dollars
34bn external debt. But the president is also under considerable domestic
pressure to resist a devaluation. Such a move, coupled with widespread
public discontent about corruption and economic mismanagement, could present
Gen Babangida with one of his toughest tests since taking office in a 1985
coup.
Yesterday, the central bank continued to withhold the outcome of Wednesday's
weekly foreign exchange auction which determines the value of the naira. The
result is normally declared on Wednesday afternoon.

BRITAIN and the US are exploring a range of new sanctions to take against
Iraq, including seizure of frozen overseas assets, if Baghdad fails to
comply with United Nations resolutions demanding elimination of its weapons
and nuclear programmes.
Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, repeated yesterday the Gulf war
allies had not ruled out a military strike against Iraqi installations and
said 'strong pressure' was building against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
The allies are determined that Mr Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi deputy prime
minister, should be left in no doubt during his visit to the UN next week
that fresh measures will be taken against Iraq unless it is more forthcoming
with details of its weapons and nuclear programmes and more diligent in
destroying what UN inspectors in the country find.
Although the allies will continue hinting that this might include a military
strike, officials stress that every other possible action would be examined
before such a course is taken.

FT  06 MAR 92 / India gets a big bout of Asian stock market fever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'EVERYONE here is watching the stock market 24 hours a day,' says the senior
partner in a Delhi chartered accountants' practice as he surveys his
employees across the desks of an open-plan office.
Stock market fever in the wake of partial deregulation of the financial
sector has gripped India as in the past it gripped South Korea, Taiwan,
Thailand and other East Asian markets.
In the first two days of trading after Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance
minister, presented his budget on Saturday, the Bombay Stock market index
(Sensex) climbed 25.8 per cent to 3,472. Since the beginning of the year it
has shot up 83 per cent.
Some brokers think the bull market could continue soaring through the 5,000
or 6,000 barrier. In South Korea the market at its peak expanded fivefold in
three years.
Others believe shares are already grossly overpriced with companies such as
Tata Iron and Steel (Tisco), India's largest private steel manufacturer,
trading on a price/earnings ratio of 50 and others much higher.
In an effort to cool the market and to prevent what the Ministry of Finance
considers an 'irresponsible' pushing up of prices by the bulls among the
brokers, the Bombay Stock Exchange closed the market yesterday and Wednesday
and has imposed far tougher conditions on trading.
It banned all forward trading in the 86 most actively traded stocks and said
all purchases must be against cash. In addition each broker can now only
purchase Rs1m (Pounds 21,760) of shares a day in any one stock and Rs10m in
the shares of the 86 most traded stocks.
The boom in the stock market coincides with a continuing fall in industrial
output and with a slowing of the rate of economic growth. Industrial growth
is expected to be negative in 1991-92 compared with a growth of 8 per cent
the year before, while the increase in real gross domestic product has
slowed to 2 per cent. The rise in corporate earnings for 1991-92 has also
slowed.
'The market is very excitable and is likely to remain so. A correction is
inevitable and would be healthy,' says Ms Asha Wagle, a director of
Perpetual Chescor, which is promoting offshore funds to invest in the Indian
market.
The government hopes a rise in stock market values will switch savings from
property and gold to productive assets.
The market has climbed since July when Dr Singh took over as Finance
Minister and presented his first budget. Brokers aggressively brought blue
chips in the belief that deregulation must push share prices skywards.
The other main factor that has driven prices up is that mutual funds and
other big purchasers have been flush with money while new issues have been
few. State-owned mutual funds have been draining savings away from bank
deposits. New private sector mutual funds are now being set up to compete
with the state-owned institutions.
But what turned bullish sentiment to fever was the weekend budget which was
unexpectedly favourable to the middle class and the capital markets.
The budget exempted financial assets (shares and bonds) from the calculation
of wealth tax. This helped fuel the stock exchange with funds from the
commodity, real estate, diamond and bullion businesses. It also removed a
damper on the market's upward path.
Mr Sevanti Lal Shah of Stewart and Co says: 'Earlier on the managers of
certain companies usually discouraged a rise in their share prices because
this entailed a bigger wealth tax liability for them. That constraint is no
longer there.'
The finance minister also announced a major measure of deregulation in
allowing companies to fix themselves the price and timing of new share
issues.
Brokers see the lifting of the government's control over the issue price as
a providing a stimulus to the market.
Finally Dr Singh boosted the market by announcing that foreign pension funds
will be allowed to make direct portfolio investments.
The most worrying aspect of market's present dizzy climb is that the Indian
stock markets lack a disciplinary body with the teeth to police trading.
Insider dealing is common. Recent moves to provide a more effective watchdog
through the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) have failed to
reassure critics.

THE plan to despatch 14,000 United Nations peacekeeping troops to Croatia
will proceed despite growing ethnic turmoil in neighbouring
Bosnia-Hercegovina, Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN special envoy said yesterday.
Speaking in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, Mr Vance appealed to the
leaders of the three main national groups - Moslems, Serbs and Croats - for
restraint to avert open conflict in the central republic.
Moslem and Serb militants earlier this week put up roadblocks in and around
Sarajevo, designated as the UN headquarters. This raised fears of an
eruption of violence which might jeopardise the deployment of the
peacekeepers.
The commander and senior aides of the UN force arrive in Yugoslavia this
weekend to prepare for the despatch of the troops, from 31 countries, over
the next month.
City officials believe that the 700 troops to be stationed in the Bosnian
capital will encourage stability in the republic. The peacekeeping operation
is due to last at least a year.
The European Commission said yesterday it would provide 1,500 tonnes of
wheat flour to displaced people in Bosnia, Reuter reports from Brussels.
It said it would transport 200 tonnes of flour a day to the Yugoslav
republic, with distribution managed by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
and the local Red Cross.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Irish Supreme Court yesterday ruled that abortion is legal under the
country's constitution, if it is carried out to protect the life of the
mother.
The ruling follows the Supreme Court's overturning last week of a High Court
injunction which prevented a 14-year-old rape victim from travelling to
Britain for an abortion.
It is likely to have far-reaching effects on Ireland's hitherto strict
anti-abortion legislation.
A 1983 'right-to-life' constitutional amendment formed the basis of the High
Court judgment.
The High Court took the view that under the amendment the unborn child's
right to life prevailed over a perceived threat to the girl's life after she
had threatened suicide.
However, Judge C J Finlay, the Supreme Court chief justice, ruled: 'I am
satisfied that . . . there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the
mother by self destruction which can only be avoided by termination of her
pregnancy'. Only one of the five Supreme Court judges dissented.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission has asked the German government to come up with an
urgent restructuring plan for the ailing east German shipbuilding industry,
as a condition for lifting the EC's ceiling on state aid to the shipyards.
Government grants to Community shipbuilders are covered by special
legislation that outlaws production aid worth more than 9 per cent of
contract value.
An independent consultants' report for the Commission has warned that even
if they are granted aid at last year's EC maximum of 13 per cent, the yards
of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on the Baltic coast will not survive. Officials
would not reveal what proportion of aid the consultants had recommended,
except to say that 13 per cent was 'far from sufficient'.
The east German yards have been beset by strikes for the last week, even
though the Treuhand privatisation agency has come up with a plan which would
keep the core of the industry intact, as demanded by the workers.
As the crisis in the Baltic shipyards grows, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's
competition commissioner, has written to Bonn warning the German authorities
that any attempt to grant aid to the east German shipbuilding industry will
require EC permission.
But the Commission is prepared to recommend a temporary raising of the
ceiling for the shipyards, probably until the end of 1993, provided Bonn
produces a 'realistic restructuring plan designed to ensure that these yards
achieve the same level of competitiveness as the rest of the Community
within an agreed period of time'. The final decision on raising the ceiling
will lie with EC governments.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Brittan attacks critics of EC line on mergers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR LEON Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner, yesterday launched a
strong counter-attack against his critics on two fronts - rejecting calls
for an independent European merger authority, and warning against the
creation of monopolistic 'Euro-champions' through mergers.
In a speech to a mainly German audience at a competition symposium in
Innsbruck, Austria, Sir Leon said that to wave through anti-competitive
mergers would be to subject European industry to 'a cruel deception'.
It was better to follow the Japanese example and encourage fierce
competition on the domestic market, he added.
Sir Leon's speech was partly aimed at his colleague Mr Martin Bangemann, the
EC industry commissioner, who is from Germany, and at Mr Wolfgang Kartte,
head of the German cartel office, who represent the two sides of the debate
on competition and industrial policy.
Mr Bangemann - who hit out last month at the influence of competition
'ayatollahs' on EC policy - believes that Sir Leon should sometimes take a
more lenient and less legalistic attitude to borderline merger cases.
Mr Kartte, for his part, has attacked the Commission for not being rigorous
enough.
In a passage obviously aimed at Mr Bangemann, who is also responsible for
the single market, Sir Leon said that the Commission's 17-month-old merger
control task force would continue to examine takeovers according to the
existing market situation. 'You cannot just assume, because we would wish it
that way, that the whole of the European Community is the true market for a
product,' he added.
Mr Bangemann has repeatedly criticised Sir Leon for recommending rejection
of the proposed Franco-Italian takeover of De Havilland, the Canadian
aircraft manufacturer, last October.
To the dismay of the Italian and French governments, the Commission voted to
block the takeover, although Mr Bangemann opposed the decision.
The controversy over the De Havilland case also revived calls for a merger
control authority which would be independent of the Commission, in the same
way that the German cartel office is independent of the Bonn government.
But Sir Leon said yesterday that the decisions of an independent EC
authority would still have to be approved by commissioners or ministers, who
would then have 'an open invitation' to exercise their political power.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN MINISTERS from all 10 independent states bordering the Baltic Sea
agreed here yesterday to revive historic trading and cultural links between
them and to create a community with its own specific identity, but closely
linked with existing European organisations.
In his opening statement, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign
minister, said he expected that, 10 years from now, all the countries in the
Baltic region would be either members of the European Community, or closely
linked to it. 'It means that it will be possible to speak of a Baltic
Community as a region within the European Community,' he said.
'Co-operation in the Baltic region should facilitate the linkage of the
European Community with the non-member countries of the region.'
The fundamental aim of the German-Danish initiative, which has brought
together Germany, Russia, Poland, all the Scandinavian states and the three
newly-independent Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, is to
bridge the divide between western and eastern Europe and to tie the former
communist states of the region firmly into the western democratic and free
market system.
The conference, which will end today, yesterday decided to establish a
Council of the Baltic Sea States, which will serve as a regional forum for
intensified co-operation and co-ordination of policies in the region,
ranging from trade to the environment, energy, transport, communications,
education, culture and humanitarian aid. A priority of the new council,
which will meet at foreign minister level once a year, supplemented by more
frequent meetings of officials, will be to give technological aid to the
former communist states in the region and to help them set up democratic
institutions.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen said he saw the Baltic Sea region as one of the most
important zones of growth in Europe in the coming decade. It contained a
diverse industrial structure, access to raw materials and a highly educated
workforce.
Everything possible should be done to realise the growth potential of the
region.
Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, stressed that the
new Councils's main task was to facilitate the eastern countries'
transformation into democratic and free market societies, with a view to
their closer association with the EC and the European economic area.

THE German chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl, yesterday said Europe's old political
divide must not be replaced with a prosperity gap and called for a new and
bold effort to help the continent's poorer eastern and central states,
Reuter reports from Helsinki.
Mr Kohl told the Nordic Council, a 40-year-old consultative parliamentary
group for the five Nordic states, that it was time for the EC to prepare a
coherent concept for developing relations with central, eastern and
south-eastern Europe.
He said he had in mind an updated version of the Organisation for European
Economic Co-operation (OEEC) which co-ordinated the so-called Marshall Plan
aid programme in the aftermath of World War Two.
'Adapted to today's challenge, a similar all-European steering instrument
could provide a decisive signal for renewal,' Mr Kohl declared.
He said Europe could not shoulder the financial burden alone and called on
other industrialised countries such as the US and Japan to contribute.
Mr Kohl, guest speaker at a meeting of the Council, said the people of the
old East Bloc must be helped through their current economic problems.
He said crises in Europe and neighbouring regions showed that it was
essential for the 12-nation EC to speak with one voice.

MR Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, took his first decisive step
towards the market after three months of hesitation yesterday, naming a
reformer, Mr Volovymyr Lanovyi, as minister for the economy with a brief to
prepare a programme of radical change.
Government officials hinted that Mr Lanovyi's powers might be enhanced by
also making him deputy prime minister and creating a special presidential
economic reform team under his direction.
Mr Lanovyi, who as minister for privatisation offered an ambitious
privatisation package which was finally approved by parliament earlier this
week, has the credentials and the ambition to become a Ukrainian version of
Poland's Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, spearheading radical reforms.
However, he could be hobbled by a lack of real authority and opposition
within what remains a largely conservative cabinet. As minister for
privatisation, Mr Lanovyi clashed with the prime minister, Mr Vitold Fokin,
who clings to the attitude he developed as Ukraine's central planner.
Hardliners have also been promoted in Ukraine's slow motion cabinet shuffle
and yesterday a reformer, Mr Oleksandr Savchenko, lost his job as deputy
governor of the Ukrainian National Bank in a struggle with its conservative
head.
The balance of power lies with Mr Kravchuk, whom parliament granted expanded
executive authority yesterday.
Mr Kravchuk may be spurred to reform by the deterioration of the Ukrainian
economy, which he described to the legislature yesterday.
He said that in the past year GDP has fallen by 21 per cent, the government
deficit has climbed to Rbs60bn and the rouble overhang - money in savings
accounts which consumers are unable to spend - has risen to Rbs130bn.
Mr Kravchuk is also beset by a crisis in agriculture, traditionally the
mainstay of the economy. Complaining that shortages of fuel and spare parts
are jeopardising the spring sowing, deputies from five agricultural regions
protested in parliament yesterday, threatening civil disobedience if prices
for industrial goods are not cut and the fuel shortage not averted.
Parliament pledged that the Ukrainian National Bank would lend Rbs20bn to
farms this season.

FT  06 MAR 92 / US keeps Hanoi trade embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday agreed to provide humanitarian aid to Vietnam in exchange
for help in finding the remains of American soldiers missing in action (MIA)
during the Vietnam War, but refused to lift its trade embargo.
Mr Richard Solomon, assistant secretary of state, agreed to provide a
minimum of Dollars 3m of government humanitarian aid, on top of around
Dollars 6m of non-governmental help now provided by US charities.
But Mr Le Mai, Vietnam's deputy foreign minister, said he was disappointed
that the US had not lifted its trade embargo.
'I must be very frank in saying that the response from the US government
remains very modest,' he said.
Mr Solomon, however, said that the US was still in the first phase of a
four-phase 'road-map' towards normalising relations with Vietnam.
This first phase includes only the discussion of normalisation, and will
focus on resolving US preoccupations about prisoners of war and servicemen
listed as missing in action in Vietnam.
The US envisages a partial lifting of the embargo in phase two, which is
linked to the establishment of the UN peace-keeping force in neighbouring
Cambodia. A complete end to the embargo would not come until phase three, at
least six months after the UN has arrived and after the last Vietnamese
soldier has left Cambodia. Vietnam publicly withdrew most of its troops from
Cambodia in 1989, although it left behind hundreds of soldiers, including
advisers.
US policy remains fixated by the fate of the MIAs. Polls show that more than
80 per cent of US veterans of the Vietnam War believe some of their comrades
are still held prisoner. The war is still a raw issue for many Americans,
and it is thought extremely unlikely that President George Bush would take
the possibly controversial step of normalising relations with Vietnam before
November's election.

<TEXT>
MR Ramon Mitra, Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives and a
leading contender to succeed President Corazon Aquino in May elections, said
yesterday that he was opposed to the operation of a nuclear power station
which was the subject of an out of court settlement in the US on Wednesday,
writes Jose Galang in Manila.
Environmentalists have aggressively opposed the plant, partly because of its
location near an earthquake fault line in Bataan province, 60 kilometres
northwest of Manila.
'The information I have is that this plant can never be operated,' Mr Mitra
said.
He was speaking after the Manila government reached an out-of-court
settlement with Westinghouse Electric of the US and Burns and Roe, a US
consultant to Westinghouse, on a bribery lawsuit against the US firms in
connection with the construction of the Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.22bn) plant.
The Philippines had accused them of bribing the late Mr Ferdinand Marcos,
when he was president, to win the contract in 1973. The settlement came a
day before the case was due to be heard in a federal court in New Jersey.
The settlement is expected to lead to suspension of the lawsuit, but Mr Rene
Saguisag, a member of the Senate committee advising the government on the
case, said if the agreement was not formalised in six months, or if the
terms were not accepted by the Philippines congress, 'the two parties would
go back to a new trial'.
In Manila, the government announced that Westinghouse would 'pay the
Philippines cash and cash equivalent in the amount of Dollars 100m and
repair, refurbish and upgrade (the plant) to current nuclear safety
standards.' The payment will comprise Dollars 10m in cash and Dollars 90m in
credits and discounts.
In exchange, Westinghouse will operate the plant for 30 years, selling
electricity to the state-run National Power Corporation at a fixed price.

FT  06 MAR 92 / Hillsdown seeks to cure jitters in the City / A report on
whether investors' gloom over the UK food-to-property group is justified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There can be few more striking examples of the change in City attitudes
since the late 1980s than the roller-coaster stock market fortunes of
Hillsdown Holdings, the food, furniture and property conglomerate.
Little known before it went public in early 1985, Hillsdown shot to favour
on the strength of its voracious appetite for takeovers. In 1986, it made
acquisitions at the rate of one a week, and by 1989 it was Britain's fourth
biggest food company.
Hillsdown insisted its dealmaking was guided by a clear strategy of turning
around troubled companies in mature businesses and consolidating them into
sector leaders. Coupled with decentralised operational management and firm
financial controls, the formula sent the company's profits and share price
soaring.
However, City enthusiasm cooled after the 1987 stock market crash. Sobered
investors took fright at Hillsdown's high debt levels, while its forays into
areas such as house-building fuelled suspicions that it had sacrificed
industrial logic for compulsive bargain-hunting.
Hillsdown, which publishes its full-year results on Wednesday, has responded
by making disposals, cutting borrowings and concentrating on food as its
core activity. Yet investor jitters have persisted.
Early last year, a bear raid sent the company's shares tumbling 30 per cent
in two days. Just as market confidence was recovering, Hillsdown saw the
disastrous reception in October of its surprise Pounds 281m rights issue.
Sir Harry Solomon, chairman, said he wanted the cash partly to make
acquisitions. But his failure to name targets alarmed shareholders that he
was wearying of 'back-to-basics' and itching to splash out on an
opportunistic shopping spree.
Today, Hillsdown's share price is 166p, well below the 210p level of the
rights issue, and its price-earnings ratio of 7.0 is among the lowest in the
UK food industry. The knowledge that maturing stock option and earn-out
schemes are set to boost the supply of Hillsdown paper in the next few years
has kept investors cautious.
But is the gloom overdone? The company's rights issue did give it a strong
balance sheet, while its recent acquisition of JP Wood, its main competitor
in poultry production, should allow Hillsdown to rationalise a sector
bedevilled by excess capacity and cut-throat pricing.
Even critics speak well of Hillsdown's skills as a cost-cutter and of the
calibre of senior operating executives. They also commend it for some
financially astute disposals and for continuing to make profits from its
house-building business, which is to be floated off once market conditions
improve.
Still, doubts linger. Apart from Hillsdown's reputation for wrong-footing
the stock market, the question remains whether it has the right recipe for
sustained profits growth in foods in the 1990s.
With Pounds 3.5bn of its total 1990 sales of Pounds 4.2bn in food, Hillsdown
ranks fourth in Europe after Nestle, Unilever, Philip Morris and BSN. It is
Britain's biggest producer of meat and poultry, canned fruit and vegetables,
jams and chocolate biscuits, and is second in tea after Brooke Bond.
Most of Hillsdown's UK products are unbranded because of the high cost of
acquiring companies with top brands and of supporting them with hefty
advertising budgets. Instead, it has sought to combine dominance over supply
in its sectors with efficient, low-cost production.
Hillsdown is Britain's biggest producer of own-label supermarket products,
and Sir Harry says this has led to close relations with leading retailers:
'It's very much a partnership. They spend a lot of time with us in our
plants, and we spend a lot of time with them.'
Sceptics argue that such relationships are far from a marriage of equals,
and that the multiples have no qualms about turning their backs on Hillsdown
when it suits their short-term interests - for example, their willingness
last year to import large volumes of chickens from France at prices UK
producers could not match.
Such incidents also serve as a reminder that a large proportion of
Hillsdown's sales and profits is tied to cyclical businesses exposed to
price competition.
Sir Harry replies that the company is withdrawing from commodity activities
and is steadily moving upmarket by emphasising higher added-value products
and improved customer service.
He also points out that food manufacturing accounts for more than half the
company's food sales and has driven much recent profits growth.
Manufacturing operations include Premier Brands, maker of Typhoo tea,
Cadbury biscuits, Chivers and Hartley preserves and Maple Leaf Foods in
Canada.
Much may depend on how rapidly Hillsdown can shift its business further into
areas where it can establish a defensible competitive advantage. 'It is now
up to us to demonstrate that we are going to pursue our strategy
successfully,' Sir Harry says.
The City may take some convincing. Today's fashion favours food
manufacturers who combine clarity of strategic purpose, predictability and a
proven record of steady growth. Companies such as Cadbury Schweppes and Tate
&amp; Lyle are perceived as models of those qualities while Hillsdown is still
widely viewed, as one analyst says, as 'awfully good at buying and selling,
but not a food company born and bred'.
Though the company says that image does not do justice to its strengths, it
concedes that it has to live with it for the moment. As Mr Kevin O'Sullivan,
finance director, says: 'The fact is that, unlike Cadbury, we haven't been
around for a 100 years. We are a creature of the 1980s.'

FT  05 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow fails to sustain
record-breaking form
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices fell across the board on late computerised selling yesterday
as stock markets failed to sustain Tuesday's record-breaking form, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 21.69 to 3,268.56.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 3.52 at
409.33, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks fell 3.96 to
630.29. Turnover on the NYSE was 208m shares. Declines outpaced rises by
1056 to 602, seen as evidence of the market's underlying weak tone.
Traders expressed disappointment that the Dow failed to break through the
3,300 barrier, blaming the downbeat mood among investors on the rise in bond
yields, which reached almost 8 per cent by midday. A later recovery in bond
markets and a fall in yields failed to help equities, though, and late
program selling left prices decisively lower at the close.
The Dow was hit by declines in two leading stocks. IBM fell Dollars 7/8 to
Dollars 87 3/8 after ratings agency Moody's downgraded Dollars 18bn of the
company's long-term debt from Triple-A to Double-A2, citing changing
customer requirements and intense competitive pressures. Merck fell Dollars
2 5/8 to Dollars 151 1/4 despite attempts by the company to dismiss rumours
concerning possible adverse research findings about its two
cholesterol-lowering drugs. Merck said studies of the drugs continued to
affirm that they worked and were safe. But the statements appeared to have
little effect on market sentiment, and at one stage trading was halted
because of an order imbalance on the sell side.
K Mart initially rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 52 7/8 before easing back to end
down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 51 1/4 after the giant retailer announced
fourth quarter to January 29 earnings of Dollars 479m, up from Dollars 402m
at the same stage a year earlier.
Dial Corporation firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 50 1/4 after the
conglomerate spun-off its GFC commercial finance and mortgage insurance
subsidiary in a de-merger. After the manoeuvre, shares in GFC and the
on-going Dial consumer products company traded on a when-issued basis.
Blockbuster Video fell Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 13 1/4 on the news that a
franchisee was suing the video retailer, claiming it had been deceived by
Blockbuster when the latter bought another video rental chain last year and
began competing head-on with the franchisee. Blockbuster said the lawsuit
was without merit.
On the over-the-counter market, Puget Sound Bancorp rose Dollars 4 1/2 to
Dollars 35 after the Washington state banking group said that it had
received several proposals regarding the sale of the company.
Canada
TORONTO stock prices crept higher on strength in transportation and
financial shares. Based on preliminary data, the composite index gained
10.85 points, or 0.30 per cent, to 3,587.64, and advancing issues edged
declines 300 to 278. Volume was 25.5m shares worth CDollars 279.3m against
the previous 19.5m shares valued at CDollars 213.9m.

exploration discussions
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ has contacted Elf Aquitaine and Total, the French state-controlled oil
groups, to negotiate possible exploration and production-sharing accords in
southern Iraq.
Both groups confirmed yesterday that they had restarted talks, shelved since
the imposition of the United Nations embargo at the start of the Gulf war,
on the exploitation of two large oil and gas reserves north of Bassorah near
the Iranian frontier.
Iraq, in desparate need of foreign exchange to tackle shortages of basic
supplies and to rebuild the economy, approached them to study crude oil
buying contracts in preparation for the possible ending of the trade
embargo.
It then extended the talks to cover exploration and production sharing.
Other western oil groups have also been approached, said Elf and Total.
Both French oil groups emphasised the talks were at an early stage, that
they had not signed commitments and would not sign anything until Iraq had
obeyed its obligations to the UN and the embargo had been lifted.
However, the Iraqi vice president, Mr Taha Yassine Ramadan, yesterday said
oil production would restart soon, and would not necessarily await a UN
security council decision. 'Certain countries realise that it is in their
interests to re-establish relations with Iraq,' he told a Jordanian
newspaper.
Elf said: 'We are simply preparing for the moment when Iraq will become
integrated into the international community. We have signed nothing and will
sign nothing until Iraq is part of the international community.' Total
warned against expecting an early agreement.
The move is the first indication of French willingness to renew trade links
with what used to be its closest ally and main trading parter in the middle
east.

FT  05 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Indian stock market reforms
gather pace - The recent spate of legislation opening up the nation's 21
exchanges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GITA PIRAMAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRUCTURAL overhaul of India's stock and capital markets has been long
overdue. Yet few observers anticipated the government would display such
enthusiasm now that it has finally tackled the job. Recently new guidelines
have been showering down on bemused market participants.
Last month the government ended its monopoly on mutual funds by permitting
private companies to start their own funds.
A few days earlier, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) was
given statutory status as an autonomous body providing investor protection,
prohibiting insider trading, promoting the development of capital markets
and regulating intermediaries.
Meanwhile, pressure on the Bombay Stock Exchange to stop operating like a
cartel is increasing.
These recent reforms are just the tip of the iceberg and more announcements
are expected. The most important and controversial measure under discussion
is the setting-up of a national stock market system.
Although the reforms so far have been generally welcomed, not everyone
supports them. One principal area of concern is Sebi's new status.
On the day the Sebi directive was announced, it was welcomed in corporate
and financial circles. Sebi had finally been given teeth. However, some are
now wondering if these are effective.
One concern is that under the guise of liberalisation, government is in fact
enhancing its own supervisory role. A closer look at the fine print reveals
Sebi can do little without an approving nod from the finance ministry.
At the country's 21 stock exchanges, however, it is business as usual and
the national index has advanced strongly.
The biggest gains have been in Bombay, where more than two thirds of the
country's trading takes place. Volume has doubled in six months.
Trading in Bombay is poised to expand with the imminent listing of the
Rs26bn worth of shares in 21 public sector undertakings (PSUs) recently sold
to financial institutions and mutual funds.
According to Mr Hemendra Kothari, the Bombay Stock Exchange president, the
market's capitalisation is expected to shoot up from the current Rs165,000bn
to Rs275,000bn after the PSUs are listed.
In the meantime the Bombay authorities are trying with limited success to
cool the heated market. None of the curbs on forward trading and speculation
have dented stockbrokers' enthusiasm.
However some of the larger traders are predicting a serious market
correction by April. This is when company results start to trickle in, and
there are many sectors of the economy that have performed well below par.
The majority of today's aggressive brokers, however, tend to dismiss these
downbeat forecasts. The opening-up of the mutual fund business to the
private sector is cited as one reason why stock markets may soon fall
sharply. Several big business houses are expected to promote their own
funds. Many, such as the Bombay-based Essar group, have already done their
homework. 'Our application is ready,' says Mr Ravi Ruia, a director.
Once the new funds flood in, too much money may end up chasing too few
scrips. However many observers believe the markets will remain buoyant
because of an expanding investor population.
Ten years ago, there were 2m investors, most of them businessmen. Though no
reliable figures are available, analysts believe that there are between 14m
and 15m investors in India today.
Currently, the Indian capital market is like a roulette table where everyone
wins. Nobody wants to predict the future.

THE sterling bond market could be in for a bumper year, with UK companies
turning to bond market investors rather than the equity market or banks to

Yesterday's debut bond issue by Cable &amp; Wireless, to finance a heavy capital
investment programme, may set a precedent for other companies this year.
Analysts at Barclays de Zoete Wedd point to a 'retrenchment and refinancing'
among UK companies which has left them well positioned to raise additional
debt finance.*
The corporate sector financial deficit, the amount of debt owed by UK
companies, reached 5 per cent of gross domestic product in 1990, at Pounds
5.23bn. By the end of 1991 the deficit had been reduced to less than 2 per
cent of gross domestic product or Pounds 2.48bn.
Most refinancing was done through the equity market last year, a ready
source of funds in the first half as institutional investors pumped money
into equities in anticipation of economic recovery. In all, Pounds 10bn was
raised from rights issues, strengthening the balance sheets of UK companies.
However, as interest rates fall debt finance will appear more attractive
vis-a-vis equity finance. The cost of equity is already high in historic
terms.
According to BZW, the inflation-adjusted cost of equity capital is currently
11.8 per cent, the highest since 1931 and well above the long-term average
of 7 per cent. The current real cost of equity finance is comparable to that
seen in 1959, which was followed by three years of negative dividend growth.
These considerations are leading some investment institutions to increase
their portfolio weightings in favour of bonds, albeit from a very low base.
'With the relatively high percentage of institutional money likely to be
allocated to fixed interest this year, it looks very much as if equity
investors will become even more choosy,' commented Ms Shira Cornwall,
director of BZW sterling bonds.
Companies making the decision to raise additional debt finance face a choice
between the banks and the bond market. It remains an open question whether
banks will be willing to provide finance at a cost acceptable to companies.
BZW argues that banks' willingness to make new loans is closely linked to
the fortunes of the property market. Large banks are exposed to the property
market through loans to consumers for house purchases and loans to property
and construction companies. Property and construction companies account for
13.5 per cent of Barclays total loan book.
In addition, the value of the banks' property counts as capital, through
property revaluations. Nearly 12 per cent of the Tier I capital of Lloyds
Bank is related to property revaluations.
However, bankers argue that demand for bank finance was so low last year
that lending margins are actually now declining as competing banks chase the
available business.
Even so, many company treasurers recognise that institutional funding from
the bond market has a utility over and above its competitiveness in terms of
cost. Raising core long-term debt from the bond market leaves bank credit
lines free to meet unexpected events.
In addition, companies in property-related sectors are likely to face
special problems in raising new bank finance. BZW expects a number of
long-dated secured debenture issues from property and construction companies
this year.
For the majority of large UK corporations - such as Cable &amp; Wireless -
unsecured bond issues of around 10 years' maturity may be the most
attractive option.
The proceeds of shorter-dated issues can be swapped into floating-rate
funding. In addition, long-dated issues generally carry covenants which tie
the borrower to strict gearing and interest cover ratios.
Moreover, bond issues of 10 years' maturity or less attract overseas buyers,
an important source of sterling funds since the UK currency joined the
European exchange rate mechanism.
Additional overseas buying was reflected in the maturity pattern of new
issues last year. Around Pounds 10.8bn fixed-rate sterling bond issues were
launched last year, double the amount raised in 1990. Around 79 per cent of
these bonds had maturities less than 10 years, much higher than average.

FT  05 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese adopt new rules on
dividends

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S securities industry has adopted new dividend payment rules in an
attempt to pull the stock market out of its continuing downturn, AP-DJ
reports from Tokyo.
The Japan Securities Dealers' Association (JSDA) is to introduce rules
forcing companies seeking to raise funds in the securities markets to make a
three-year pledge to distribute at least 30 per cent of after-tax profit as
dividend payments.
The rules, which go into effect on April 1, are designed to make stock
investment more attractive. The JSDA said companies currently distributed an
average of 22 to 23 per cent of their after-tax profit as dividends.
From April 1, a company which issues new stocks, convertible bonds or
warrant bonds, must maintain its dividend-to-payout ratio at 30 per cent or
more for three consecutive business years.
Highly profitable and fast-growing companies, however, will be exempt from
the new rules if their profit-to-capital ratio stands at 8 per cent or more
and their dividend-to-capital ratio comes to 2.4 per cent or more.
Currently, about half of companies listed on the stock exchange's first
section meet the 30 per cent requirement.
The names of companies that fail to honour their pledges would be made
public, the JSDA said.
New stock issuance has not occurred for nearly two years, amid the market's
prolonged weakness, due to concern about the oversupply of stocks. Heavy
equity-linked financing, conducted while neglecting the profits of share
holders, has been criticised as one of factors behind the stock market
slump.
Investors, such as life insurance companies, have been urging a rise in
dividends over the past year.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts tumble on fears over UK government
borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BUDGET and political worries dealt a sharp blow to the UK government bond
market, with gilt prices tumbling by as much as one percentage point during
the day.
The market fell back on speculation that the March 10 Budget may contain tax
cuts and lead to higher borrowing by the government over the next couple of
years, according to traders.
While a cut in income tax could be seen as increasing the chances of the
Conservative party winning a general election and therefore could be
interpreted as positive for the gilt market, traders pointed out that
instead the market appears to be focusing on the funding implications.
'Already we are expecting a public sector borrowing requirement of at least
Pounds 23bn in 1992-93, so a tax giveaway in the Budget does not look good
for the market,' said one dealer.
Yesterday's drop in the gilt market was futures-driven. The Liffe gilt
futures contract, which opened at 97.26, breached the important support
level of 97.08, which in turn encouraged further selling of futures. The
contract traded at 96.21 by late afternoon. Futures volumes were heavy at
about 49,000 contracts, well above the average level of 19,000.
In the cash market, long-dated issues dropped heavily with the benchmark 11
3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 falling from 116.00 to 114 7/8 . Short-dated
issues were not as badly hit, with the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 slipping
from 101.00 to 100 29/32 .
US TREASURY markets bounced back from early weakness yesterday, aided by
weak auto sales and sporadic short-covering.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  3/32 at 101
1/16 , yielding 7.90 per cent. The two-year note was slightly lower, down
1/32 at 99 13/16 , yielding 5.459 per cent.
Although the market held its ground for the early hours of trading, the
cumulative effect of recent data suggesting the economy was pulling out of
recession - in particular Tuesday's leading indicators and new home sales
figures - eventually took its toll. By midday, the long-bond was more than
half a point lower.
Retail investors were again sidelined, unwilling to return until tomorrow's
important employment report for February. It was the professional dealers
who turned prices around. Against the background of poor 10-day car sales
figures, speculative traders moved to cover short positions, lifting prices
across the board.
GERMAN government bonds drifted lower, taking their lead from the US and UK
markets.
Traders said there was some dismay at the Bundesbank's decision to drain
DM2.5bn from rities repurchase tender. Dealers had expected the Bundesbank
to replace fully two securities repurchase pacts worth DM44.5bn which
expired yesterday, but the central bank allocated only DM42bn.
Technical factors also pushed the market slightly lower, according to
traders, as the March futures contracts were rolled over into the June
contract, which has now taken over as the main contract.
The June bund futures contract opened at 88.83 and slipped back to 88.56 by
late afternoon on a volume of 44,000.
YEN weakness against the US dollar continued to weigh on the Japanese
government bond market yesterday.
The dollar ended at Y131.50, despite intervention by the Bank of Japan in
the foreign exchange markets, up from Y131.03 in New York late Tuesday and
Y129.94 in Tokyo on Tuesday.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 bond moved in a range of 5.435 to 5.475
per cent, but it closed almost unchanged on the day at 5.45 per cent.

THE LARGEST transaction on any trading floor involving foreign exchange

A record 180,800 contracts for French franc options, representing Dollars
8.1bn in underlying value, were traded.
PaineWebber, the US brokerage house, brokered the trade from its Paris
office in two stages. Philadelphia market-makers Mitsui T&amp;B Options and SBC
Derivatives represented more than 60 per cent of the contra side of the
customer trade.
The transaction divided into three lots of options with a June expiration

Each French franc option on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange represents
FFr250,000.
Mr Joseph Rizzello, senior vice-president of the exchange, said the trade
had been handled with relative ease and at good prices, demonstrating the
exchange's deep liquidity.

ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, is to take a 90 per cent stake in Capital Markets
Equities (CME), the Spanish stockbroker, and inject about Fl 25m into the
company, AP-DJ reports from Amsterdam.
ABN Amro said the sale price was in the area of 'tens of millions of
guilders'. It was delaying an official announcement until full approval was
received from the government, which is likely to act within a few weeks.
CME is a subsidiary of Capital Markets Holding, in which ABN Amro holds a 20
per cent stake. In 1991, CME booked net losses of Pta23m, while the previous
year it fell Pta79m into the red.
The deal follows the recent announcement that ABN Amro had agreed to buy
Hoare Govett, the UK stockbroker.

HOPEWELL Holdings, the Hong Kong property and construction group controlled
by local entrepreneur Mr Gordon Wu, yesterday announced a 94 per cent rise
in earnings to HKDollars 700m (USDollars 90.9m) in the half-year to December
1991, from HKDollars 361m in the corresponding period of 1990.
The half-year profit figure included a HKDollars 285m exceptional gain from
the disposal of a partial interest in a Hong Kong property development.
Turnover was down 19.5 per cent to HKDollars 600m from HKDollars 716.9m
Adjusted for a one-for-one rights issue last June, Hopewell's earning per
share fell to 19 cents from 22 cents. Directors declared an interim dividend
of 14 cents a share, up from 11 cents for the previous period. They said
they expected to achieve 'encouraging results' this year.
Directors said that good progress had been made during the half-year on the
construction of a super highway linking Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong
province, with the special economic zones of Shenzhen and Zhuhai.
Detailed design work was underway on plans it has to build an elevated road
and rail system in Bangkok, together with associated property development.
Initial site work will start this month, and full-scale construction is
planned for later in the year.
The company's power stations in Guangdong are currently supplying 12 per
cent of total electricity consumed in the province.
A preliminary agreement has been signed with the Guangdong government to
construct a third power station. The company is now in negotiations with
suppliers.
Its power plant in Luzon, the Philippines, is operating well and it is
planning another to feed into the Luzon grid.

<TEXT>
A LEGAL rumpus broke out yesterday between Blockbuster Entertainment, the
Florida-based video rental chain which recently acquired the Cityvision
group in the UK, and one of its US franchisees, Capitol Entertainment.
Capitol, which is largely owned by the Zale jewellery store family, filed a
civil complaint in the Dallas courts, alleging Blockbuster deceived it when
it purchased the Erol's Video Store chain last year.
It is claiming Dollars 40m in actual damages and Dollars 100m in punitive
damages.
Blockbuster dismissed the suit as 'without merit,' although its shares eased
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 13 1/8 on the news.
At the time of its purchase by Blockbuster, Erol had around 200 outlets.
Some of these were based in the Capitol franchise areas of Northern Virginia
and Maryland.
Capitol, the seventh largest Blockbuster franchisee, alleges the larger
group promised not to acquire Erol until it had deals to sell Capitol the
Erol stores in its territories.
It contends Blockbuster went ahead with the Erol purchase regardless of this
and then offered to sell the relevant stores 'on only the most onerous and
difficult terms'.
Blockbuster then went to operate these stores, claims the suit, devoting a
disproportionate share of advertising funds to Erol.
Blockbuster said yesterday it currently operated around 100 of the former
Erol stores, although it added some were sold on to franchisees other than
Capitol. Blockbuster added that it believed the operation of the former Erol
stores was within its rights under the agreement with Capitol, and the suits
would be vigorously defended.

sales fall

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE continuing controversy over the safety of Halcion, the sleeping pill
alleged to have harmful side-effects, was among the key concerns that led to
the downgrading yesterday of the long-term debt rating of Upjohn, the US
drugs company, by Moody's Investor Service.
The rating agency said that sales of Halcion were 'falling sharply due to
adverse publicity and regulatory actions'.
Moody's noted that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had recently said
its data supports Halcion's effectiveness, but stressed that deeper
investigation by the FDA and other regulators 'could result in additional
restrictions on Halcion or all drugs of its class'.
Moody's lowered the rating of Upjohn's long-term debt to Double-A3 from
Double-A2. About Dollars 520m of debt is affected.
Upjohn has steadfastly denied charges that it failed to disclose the
side-effects of Halcion to the FDA and has launched a lawsuit against Dr Ian
Oswald, a Scottish psychiatry professor who is a leading critic of Halcion.
Aside from concern about Halcion, which has Dollars 260m of annual sales and
is Upjohn's second biggest drug product, Moody's also noted that Upjohn's
marketing exclusivity in the US for Xanax tranquilliser, Ansaid
anti-inflammatory agent and Halcion expires in 1993. Moody's said these
three products represent a significant portion of Upjohn's pharmaceuticals
earnings, which could fall when the exclusivity ends next year.

FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: IBM long-term debt rating cut by
Moody's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, for decades the most blue chip of all US
manufacturing companies, yesterday suffered the indignity of having its
long-term debt downgraded by Moody's Investors Service, a leading credit
rating agency.
Moody's cut its senior debt rating from Aaa, the highest possible ranking,
to Aa2, on the grounds that its 'credit quality over the longer term will be
adversely affected by shifting customer requirements and intense competitive
pressures'.
The blow is likely to be more psychological than practical since the
company's rating is still high and Moody's stressed that 'IBM remains an
exceptionally strong credit'.
However, analysts said the move was a further sign that IBM, which used to
dominate the global computer industry, was a diminished force facing strong
pressures from smaller and nimbler rivals - which it is now trying to
emulate through a management shake-up and decentralisation.
The first downgrading of IBM's debt occurred last year at the hands of Duff
&amp; Phelps, another rating agency, but Wall Street tends to pay more attention
to the views of Moody's and Standard and Poor's.
S&amp;P retains its top rating on IBM - AAA - but has had the company on
'negative outlook' since last August. It has said in the past that a
downgrade would be possible if IBM failed to improve profits when it shipped
its new line of mainframe computers, a process which began in late 1990.
IBM said it was disappointed with Moody's action but believed the impact on
its worldwide financing requirements would be minimal.
The company said that in seven of the 10 years from 1980 to 1990 it had been
the most profitable company among the Fortune 500. Although 1991 had been a
difficult year, it had earned pre-tax profits of nearly Dollars 4bn. It had
also cut its operational expense and gained additional financial stability
through growth in software, rentals, financing and services.
However, Moody's said it believed that 'IBM's competitive environment, and
its own necessary remedial actions to adapt to it, will continue to induce
volatility in its operating performance, and that overall returns and
margins will stabilise at lower levels than those IBM has historically
reported'.
The company's Prime-1 short-term rating in the commercial paper market,
where IBM is an important player, is not affected.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KMART, one the largest US retailers, yesterday reported a 13.6 per cent
improvement in after-tax profits to Dollars 859m in the 12 months to January
29.
The advance was scored on sales up by 7.8 per cent during the year at
Dollars 34.6bn. However, on a same-store basis the increase was far more
modest - 3.7 per cent rise.
At the operating profit level, Kmart posted an 11.7 per cent increase at
Dollars 1.64bn.
During the final quarter of the year, Kmart's progress was slightly ahead of
that for the year overall. Sales were up 8.3 per cent at Dollars 10.6bn;
pre-tax profits rose 20.2 per cent to Dollars 725m; and net profits
increased 19.2 per cent to Dollars 479m.
Yesterday, Kmart shares fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 51 1/4 .
Mr Joseph Antonini, Kmart chief executive, acknowledged that the 'weak
economic environment adversely affected sales of electronics and other
big-ticket categories'.
But he said better profitability in the Kmart fashion division and some
strong sales and earnings gains in the specialist store operations had
produced the improvement.
He added that there were 'early signs that the economic environment is
strengthening'. The company, he said, plans to complete 450 to 500 projects
 -a mixture of new stores and refurbishments - in the current 12 months. In
the past year, it completed 474, opening 55 new full-sized Kmart stores.
Kmart operates over 4,000 retail outlets in the US, Puerto Rico and Canada,
and takes in the Pay Less Drug Store chain, PACE warehouse clubs,
Waldenbooks, and a number of other specialty chains.

FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Minolta settles with Honeywell
for Dollars 127.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINOLTA, the Japanese camera manufacturer, yesterday agreed to pay
Honeywell, the US controls group, Dollars 127.5m to settle a long-running
patents dispute - a move which could have serious repercussions for other
Japanese camera companies.
The settlement follows a Dollars 96m award to Honeywell last month by a jury
in a New Jersey federal court, which ruled that Minolta had infringed a
Honeywell patent on camera auto-focusing technology, although not wilfully.
Honeywell said at the time that the award would allow it to put pressure on
15 other Japanese camera companies with which it is in dispute over
auto-focus technology.
Minolta had been widely expected to appeal against the jury's ruling,
delaying a final settlement for a year or more.
However, it said yesterday it would pay Dollars 127.5m to settle the
lawsuit, including Honeywell's claims for interest, and for a fully paid-up
world licence to manufacture and sell its products under all the relevant
Honeywell patents.
Mr Sam Kusumoto, chairman of the group's US subsidiary, said: 'Reaching a
decision to settle was not an easy one. However, we believe that eliminating
the cost and distraction of prolonged litigation is in the best interests of
our 2,900 US employees, as well as tens of thousands of Minolta dealers who
have supported us in this dispute.'
Japanese camera-makers were surprised at the speed of the agreement, which
sets an unwelcome precedent for them and for some electronics companies who
fear their video camera equipment could be a target for complaint from
Honeywell.
Several Japanese makers, including Canon and Asahi Optical, say they have
been gathering technical information in expectation of negotiations with the
US company, while Nikon, another leading maker, has argued that it had
developed its own technology and would not be affected.
It is unclear how many of the 15 makers targeted by Honeywell will agree to
settle out of court, but the makers have feared that the US company could
take action to limit their sales of related equipment.
The decision has come at a difficult time for Japanese camera companies,
which are expected to report sharply lower earnings for this period.

CARREFOUR, the hyper-market group which last year staged the largest
takeover in the French hypermarket industry, yesterday announced a 10.7 per
cent decline in annual profits.
Net earnings fell to FFr1.21bn (Dollars 210m) last year, from FFr1.35bn in
1990, in line with earlier forecasts.
This contrasts with a 32.3 per cent rise in sales, from FFr75.84bn to
FFr100.37bn over the same period, supported by the inclusion since July of
Euromarche, Carrefour's main rival, which the group bought last June for
FFr5bn.
Profits were hit by a FFr382m exceptional write-down, partly for Euromarche
and partly for Montlaur, a bankrupt supermarket chain acquired last March.
Carrefour also reported a FFr364m capital gain on asset sales over the
period.
The board will recommend an unchanged annual dividend of FFr32.5 per share.
SEB, the French brown goods group which owns the Tefal and Calor brand
names, yesterday bucked the trend in the French corporate sector by
announcing a 34 per cent increase in net profits to FFr312m from FFr233m in
1990, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
Earnings per share increased to FFr109.9 during the year and the board
proposed a dividend of FFr34 per share.

FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Anheuser seeks stake in rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANHEUSER-BUSCH of the US, the world's biggest brewer, which produces the
international Budweiser beer brand, is seeking a 30 per cent stake in the
rival Budweiser Budvar brewery in Czechoslovakia.
Mr Jerry Ritter, Anheuser's chief financial officer, said yesterday the
company had told the Czech government it wanted to end its long-running
trademark battle with Budvar and to co-operate in developing the Budweiser
brands.
Anheuser would help Budvar to expand its capacity - at present only 300,000
barrels a year against Anheuser's 86m barrels - and to market its beer
internationally.
Mr Ritter claimed Anheuser was the 'preferred bidder' among 42 brewers which
were trying to acquire a holding in Budvar when it is privatised.
The US brewer has given assurances it would maintain the independence of the
Czech company and its management, the quality of the beer and the integrity
of the brand.
Mr Ritter said: 'The heritage of the Czech beer is very important to the
expansion of the brand in eastern and central Europe and beyond.
It is quite different from the US Budweiser and we believe the two can be
developed successfully side by side.'
The bid for a Budvar stake marks the first step in what is likely to become
a more acquisitive approach by Anheuser to its international expansion.
While its priority for the next few years is to increase its 44.1 per cent
of the US market to more than 50 per cent, it wants to acquire good quality
brewers and beer brands worldwide.
Anheuser sells 2.5m hectolitres of beer - less than 3 per cent of total
annual production - outside the US. It is brewed under licence in Japan, its
main overseas market, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Denmark and South Korea; and
it is exported from the US to 40 other countries.
Growth in the UK and mainland Europe has been relatively slow.
It has taken the UK operations, accounting for 80 per cent of European
volume and in which Anheuser has recently taken direct control of marketing
and distribution, seven years to become profitable.

NORSKE Skogindustrier, one of Norway's biggest pulp and paper producers, may
be forced to close Papeteries de Golbey, a French newsprint mill, on
environmental grounds, writes Karen Fossli.
The local authorities in Nancy have withdrawn the company's permit for
emissions dispensation, said Norske Skog, which has a 49 per cent stake in
the plant. Papeteries was opened last December and Norske Skog has invested
NKr3bn (Dollars 468.7m) in it.
The other main shareholder is E. Holzman, the German company, with 35 per
cent. Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, two of Norway's three biggest banks,
each own a 2 per cent stake.
Norske Skog said that the mill was not being closed down because of current
emissions violations. He explained that the permit was withdrawn because
French environmental organisations claimed that insufficient impact studies
were undertaken by the company in order to secure the emissions dispensation
permit.
Mr Tingstad said that the company had spent NKr400m on emissions reduction
equipment and that it was seeking a temporary emissions dispensation permit.

CHRISTIANIA Bank, Norway's second biggest bank, yesterday announced huge
losses for 1991 and confirmed that it needed NKr2.5bn (Dollars 385m) in
fresh core capital to meet capital adequacy requirements.
Christiania's accounts for 1991 show net losses of NKr9.17bn, against
NKr1.85bn previously. This follows an increase in loan losses to NKr5.99bn
from NKr2.68bn. It warned of further net losses this year.
Operating losses last year swelled to NKr7.96bn from NKr1.79bn. There was a
charge of NKr2.266bn for losses and write-downs on sales of fixed assets,
against NKr307m in 1990.
Christiania suffered a NKr359m loss on securities trading versus a NKr65m
gain in 1990. The bank saw net interest income fall by NKr592m to NKr2.65bn.
Non-interest income declined by NKr437m to NKr1.12bn.
The bank reduced it staffing levels by 1,000 to 4,511 during the year and
operating costs were trimmed by NKr134m to NKr3.48bn.
A provision of NKr1.173bn was made to the bank's loan loss reserve fund,
increasing it to NKr2.8bn at the end of 1991.
'Although substantial loan loss provisions were made in 1991 for
non-performing loans and especially loss exposed loans there is perceived to
be, based on experience, considerable risk in other parts of the loan
portfolio,' Christiania said.
Non-performing loans increased to NKr13.8bn by the end of last year, or 15.8
per cent of total loans, from NKr9.9bn at the end of 1990.
At end-1991 Christiania met the domestic capital adequacy requirement of 4
per cent of risk-weighted balance sheet items after receiving NKr7.86bn in
state cash.
Mr Borger Lenth, Christiania's president, forecast that the bank could
achieve a profit, before credit losses, in 1992 but Mr Per Ditlev-Simonsen,
chairman, said that Christiania would post a net loss for 1992.
Mr Sigbjoern Johnsen, the finance minister, said that fresh cash transfers
to the state-backed Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) would be discussed by the
government in April in connection with the 1992 revised budget.
The fund, which acts as a safety net to support the banks and which received
a state injection of NKR11bn last year, has been drained to around NKr550m
by heavy claims.

FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Swiss Bank Corporation climbs
24% to SFr1.03bn

<TEXT>
SWISS Bank Corporation (SBC) reports consolidated net profits of SFr1.03bn
(Dollars 684m) in 1991, up 24.7 per cent despite soaring provisions for bad
debts.
Mr Walter Frehner, chief executive of Switzerland's second largest bank,
said at a press conference that the SBC group out-performed its own targets
last year and he was optimistic about achieving further growth this year.
'If our provisioning needs are as expected lower than in 1991, our ambitious
goals could be well within reach,' Mr Frehner said.
Gross operating income jumped 49 per cent to SFr2.8bn, but provisions for
bad loans, including SFr211m against a SFr330m exposure to companies
formerly led by Mr Robert Maxwell, jumped 81 per cent to SFr1.5bn.
The extraordinarily high level of bad loans in the UK and in the US, where
SBC has a large real estate loan portfolio, depressed the contribution of
foreign subsidiaries to group net profit to only 2 per cent.
Net interest earnings were up 10.4 per cent to SFr2.9bn and commission
income gained 14.6 per cent to SFr1.7bn, thanks mainly to fees from
portfolio management operations.
Income from financial operations and trading soared 123 per cent to SFr1.5bn
in large part because of the strengthening of the group's derivatives
business. Mr Frehner said SBC's share of profits from its joint venture with
The O'Connor Partnerships of Chicago was SFr107m, well ahead of
expectations.
Total assets of the SBC group rose 8.5 per cent to SFr207bn, with two-thirds
of the growth arising from the consolidation of Banca della Svizzera
Italiana (BSI), in which SBC now has a 58 per cent stake.
Published capital and reserves rose 4 per cent to SFr12.5bn. Mr Frehner said
there was no justification for Moody's, the US credit rating agency, to
downgrade SBC's long-term debt from its triple A rating. Moody's put SBC on
its watch list in January at the same time as it removed its triple A rating
from Credit Suisse, Switzerland's third largest bank.
BSI is to become the core of a new subsidiary within SBC to specialise in
private banking. SBC will sell four of its Swiss private banking
subsidiaries to BSI and will take over the business of BSI's commercial
branches outside of the Italian language part of Switzerland.
The new bank, to be called SBSI Holding, will have total assets of about
SFr8.1bn and funds under management of roughly SFr33bn.

FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: BSN bid for Exor cleared by
bourse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BSN, the French food group, yesterday received the go-ahead from the Paris
stock market authorities for its FFr6bn (Dollars 1bn) hostile bid for Exor,
the French property company that controls Perrier mineral water.
The BSN bid, unveiled in late February, offers FFr1,420 a share for Exor. It
is a counter-bid against the FFr1,320-a-share offered last year by Ifint, a
company controlled by the Agnelli family of Italy, once thought to be an
ally of BSN.
BSN has joined forces with Nestle, the Swiss food group which is one of its
chief competitors, against the Agnellis in the battle for Perrier. Nestle is
waiting to hear the results of a series of French court cases which are
critical in determining the course of its FFr13.42bn hostile bid for
Perrier.
Last week, Exor and its allies, which include Saint Louis, the French sugar
company, complied with a French stock market authority ruling by tabling a
full bid for Perrier. The Exor camp, which already controls nearly 49 per
cent of the mineral water company, made an unconditional offer at the same
level of FFr1,475 a share offered by Nestle.
The Exor camp is fighting against Nestle's attempt in the courts to freeze
the voting rights on Exor's Perrier shares and to annul the recent sale of
13.8 per cent of Perrier to Saint Louis. The French police are now
investigating suspected irregularities in the Saint Louis share sale.
Perrier's shares yesterday rose to FFr1,531 from FFr1,517 when they returned
to trading after suspension. Perrier is trading above the FFr1,475 a share
offered by Nestle and Exor. Exor's shares fell to FFr1,490 from FFr1,495
when they resumed trading. The closing date for the pending bid by Ifint for
Exor has been extended to April 23 from March 24, AP-DJ reports. Paris
bourse authorities cited the recently accepted competing offer launched by
BSN as the reason for the extension.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stat-Plus Group, the retailer of office and legal stationery, ascribed its
fall in pre-tax profits in 1991 to the 'deepening UK recession'.
This, it said, curbed the number of homes bought in spite of the reductions
in interest rates. Inevitably, conveyancing, one of the company's main
business areas, continued to suffer due to lower transaction levels and a
concomitant low demand for law forms and specialist legal stationery.
Profits fell 16 per cent to Pounds 4.81m (Pounds 5.71m) on turnover
marginally down at Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 11.9m).
However, the final dividend is raised to 4p making 7.125p (6.25p) for the
year. Earnings slipped to 15p (17.2p) per share.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Transfer Technology, which changed its name from Central &amp; Sheerwood last
May following reorganisation and the decision to concentrate on specialised
engineering, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.51m in 1991.
Before the acquisitions of TransTec and the PSS group, C&amp;S made pre-tax
profits for 1990 of Pounds 2.94m. On a pro forma annualised basis 1990
profits would have been Pounds 3.5m.
Mr Geoffrey Robinson, chairman, said the group came through 1991 with much
improved results thanks to tight cost controls, good gross margins and a
strong position in export markets; more than 75 per cent of the TransTec
Group output is exported and in the control technology division over 95 per
cent is exported with an average gross margin of 50 per cent.
The dividend is increased from 10p to 13p with a recommended final of 6.75p,
after adjusting for the consolidation and subdivision of the 1p ordinary
into 50p ordinary shares.
Earnings emerged at 40p (31p).

FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: CRH declines by 25% to IPounds 62.6m as
recession bites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION has finally caught up with CRH, the international building
materials group and one of Ireland's biggest companies.
The group yesterday announced that pre-tax profits last year fell by a
quarter from IPounds 83.5m to IPounds 62.6m (Pounds 58.1m).
However, the figures, accompanied by a 7.5 per cent dividend increase, will
be better than most UK building materials companies will announce during the
next few weeks.
The group has already paid a second interim dividend, in lieu of a final, of
4.3p making a total of 6.45p (6p), which is covered 2.7 times by earnings of
17.46p (23.2p) per share.
This comes at a time when some large construction groups will be able only
to maintain dividend payments by dipping into reserves.
Mr Tony Barry, chief executive, said that the group's resilience had been
due to the broad geographical spread of its businesses divided evenly
between the Republic of Ireland, the UK, continental Europe and the US.
Even so last year was difficult for the group as European and US
construction markets came under pressure.
Operating profits fell in all four divisions as turnover declined by 6 per
cent from IPounds 1.22bn to Pounds 1.15bn.
The biggest falls were in the UK where profits tumbled by 72 per cent to
just IPounds 4.36m (IPounds 15.4m) and in the US where profits fell 29 per
cent to IPounds 13.6m.
The UK's contribution to group operating profits has fallen from about 25
per cent three years ago to 5 per cent last year.
Irish profits, affected by lower domestic construction and reduced exports
to a depressed UK market, fell by 5 per cent from IPounds 42.6m to IPounds
36m.
Continental European profits fell by just 3.1 per cent to Pounds 30.1m
helped by a strong performance from recent German purchases. Profits in
Spain and the Netherlands, however, dipped slightly.
Mr Barry warned that this year was likely to be just as difficult with
construction output forecast to fall further in many of the countries in
which the group operates.
Nonetheless, it was continuing to generate a positive cashflow and its
balance sheet was secure.
Gearing, including convertible capital bonds as debt, fell from 51 per cent
to 37 per cent by end-December.
If the bonds were classed as equity gearing fell from 14 per cent to 5 per
cent, Mr Barry said.
COMMENT
The recession is really biting if a company with CRH's spread of businesses
is starting to feel the pinch. This year does not look like being much
better than the last two. Few building material companies, however, are as
in good a shape as CRH, illustrated by the group's IPounds 41m positive
cashflow last year. A similar position is likely in the current year when
pre-tax profits may be a same again IPounds 62m. This would put the group on
a p/e of 13 which looks cheap given the quality of the businesses and the
balance sheet. The stock (perhaps because it is Dublin-based) has
traditionally traded at a discount to the sector. It deserves better.
CRH's figures, accompanied by a 7.5 per cent dividend increase, will be
better than most UK building materials companies will announce during the
next few weeks.

FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Welpac seeking Pounds 3.54m to fund
acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WELPAC IS planning two acquisitions and a placing and open offer to fund
both the purchases and the further expansion of the company.
The hardware and electrical goods wholesaler and distributor is to buy
Anderson &amp; Firmin, a supplier of gardening hardware products, and a 40 per
cent stake in Kibro Elbert Glove, a maker of gardening gloves, for an
initial Pounds 925,000 and a further maximum of Pounds 225,000.
The second proposed acquisition is of TJ Harwood, a supplier and packager of
door furniture and other hardware products, for an initial Pounds 750,000
for a 51 per cent stake and further consideration of up to Pounds 1.96m for
the balance.
In addition the company is to establish, with Brauckmann &amp; Probsting of
Germany, a joint venture for the distribution of Stanley branded hardware
products in that country.
To gain the Pounds 2.03m cash for the acquisitions and to provide working
capital for the enlarged group and the joint venture, Welpac is to raise
about Pounds 3.54m net via an issue of 20.8m subscription shares. These,
with the 4.34m of the consideration shares issued to the vendors of Anderson
&amp; Firmin, will be subject to a placing and open offer on a 1-for-2.208619
basis at 19p per share.

FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: British Vita launches Pounds 73.4m rights
for possible takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH VITA, the Manchester-based polymer, fibre and foam company, is
raising about Pounds 73.4m through a 1-for-5 rights issue to finance
possible future acquisitions.
Mr Rod Sellers, chief executive, said the company had no specific targets
but wanted to be ready if opportunities, principally in Europe, arose. Mr
Bob McGee, chairman, said: 'We are at a crossroads right now, and we want to
drive on into Europe'.
The rights issue, which is fully underwritten, is being arranged by
Kleinwort Benson Securities and is priced at 212p. The shares fell 7p to
258p yesterday.
The company also announced a slight drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 50.4m
(Pounds 54.2m) for the year to end-December. The fall was due to a lower
contribution from associates which dropped to Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 5.9m). The
company's share of losses from Spartech, its 29 per cent-owned US associate,
totalled Pounds 2.3m.
Sales in the UK and Spain were affected by recession but in Germany, the
company's largest market after the UK, demand remained stable.
Earnings fell to 16.9p (18.8p). The directors are recommending a final
dividend of 3.6p to make a total of 7.05p (6.7p).
Acquisitions made during the year in the Netherlands and US cost Pounds 43m.
Gearing increased slightly to 20 per cent on shareholders funds of Pounds
164m.
COMMENT
Calling on shareholders in current market conditions without a specific
reason is a little cheeky. But judging from the share price, which remained
firm after an initial drop, British Vita has got away with it. That is
partly because of the company's good track record, and partly because even
its problem areas look containable. Its US associate has already been
refinanced and made a small operating profit in the first quarter. Spain
will take longer to turn round, but is small in comparison with the rest of
the group. British Vita's strategy of picking up small acquisitions through
Europe has already proved fruitful, and the company's decentralised
management structure is likely to throw up increasing possibilities. Pre-tax
profits for this year of about Pounds 59m put the shares on an adjusted
earnings multiple of 15. While investors may want to take up their rights,
the shares are fully valued.

FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: British Polythene ahead 16%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Polythene Industries, the UK's largest polythene film products
maker, yesterday announced a 16 per cent increase, to Pounds 10.3m, in
pre-tax profits for 1991.
Mr Cameron McLatchie, chairman, said the results were due to resilience
among its retailing customers like J Sainsbury and to cost cuttings which
improved margins.
But the industrial division, which produces products such as fertiliser bags
and packaging for building supplies, saw falling volumes and tighter
margins.
Turnover, which dipped to Pounds 156.1m (Pounds 158.4m) because of
discontinued operations, was helped by a final quarter contribution from
Courtaulds Plastic Films, taken over in September and renamed Brithene.
A sharply reduced interest charge, down nearly Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.98m,
reflected lower polymer prices, which reduced borrowings, and proceeds from
the October rights issue. Gearing fell to 13 per cent to 50 per cent.
Fully diluted earnings increased 10 per cent to 23.79p per share. A final
dividend of 6p makes a total of 9p (8.25p).
COMMENT
British Polythene's shares have outperformed the market by 70 per cent in
the past year and these results show why. The company is gaining a
reputation for its management and has come through difficult trading
conditions for its industrial products yet has improved overall margins by
18 per cent at the pre-tax profit level. Looking ahead, the company's
recycling business looks interesting, gaining big name customers despite a
price disadvantage following the fall in 'virgin' polymer prices. There is
significant potential for this division should environmental awareness
continue to grow or polymer prices return to historical levels. Forecast
pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.5m for this year put the shares on 16 times
earnings. That is starting to look expensive, but yesterday's 7p advance in
the share price to 415p suggests the City is comfortable at these levels.

FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Templeton Galbraith up to Dollars 69m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JUMP in profits from its treasury activities helped Templeton, Galbraith
and Hansberger, the Bahamas-based fund management group, to announce
yesterday a 9.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in the calendar year
1991.
Operating profits of the company, which reports in dollars, edged only
slightly up from Dollars 55.5m to Dollars 56m (Pounds 31.8m), but other
operating income - consisting of profits on treasury activities such as bond
trading - grew from Dollars 8.3m to Dollars 13.6m.
This helped pre-tax profits rise from Dollars 63.1m to Dollars 69.1m and
earnings per share increase from 36.3 cents to 39.5 cents.
The group also announced a 40 per cent rise in its final dividend to 14
cents (10 cents), making a total of 21 cents per share (15 cents).
The shares rose 10p to 317p on the news.
Templeton is proposing changes in the charging structure of its mutual
funds, the US equivalent of unit trusts. At present Templeton funds have a
high initial charge (the so-called front end load).
Much of the US industry has moved to a lower initial load, with a sliding
redemption charge on investors who sell their holdings within seven years.
The group believes a change in its charging structure will lead to an
increase in sales.
Although funds under management rose 20 per cent from Dollars 15.9bn to
Dollars 19.1bn, this was mainly due to investment performance and rising
markets.
Lower mutual fund sales resulted in a fall in distribution costs from
Dollars 62.35m to Dollars 49.9m. But administrative expenses rose from
Dollars 57.8m to Dollars 69.3m, reflecting increased staff levels and
competitive pressures on pay.
COMMENT
Templeton's shares have risen almost 50 per cent since the group last
announced its annual results and now stand on a historic p/e of about 14,
based on last night's foreign exchange rates. Despite the confident 40 per
cent increase in the dividend, investors might be wondering whether it is
time for the shares to take a breather. The company is about to undertake
what might be a difficult shift in its mutual fund charging structure; its
administrative costs have risen sharply; the bulk of its profits increase
came from the (perhaps unrepeatable) treasury gains; and the US stock market
has had a very good run. That said, the company's financial position is
strong and those who agree with Templeton's bullish views for equities in
the 1990s will not be daunted.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Building a dream on drug marketing: Medeva's two-year growth
to become the world's fifth largest vaccine maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years ago Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith scribbled a mission statement on a table
napkin over lunch with financiers from Credit Lyonnais; before the end of
the century he would build an FTSE-100 pharmaceutical company.
At the time Medeva, the vehicle for this dream, had still to shed the image
of being a speculative stock losing money in its search for a cancer cure;
it was out of favour with the City and its shares languished at half the
price of a heavily under-subscribed 16-for-5 rights issue.
Today, Medeva is the world's fifth largest vaccine maker and the UK's
largest unbranded generic pharmaceuticals manufacturer.
Mr Gowrie-Smith, managing director, has put together a team of
pharmaceutical executives led by Mr Bernard Taylor, former chief executive
of Glaxo, that includes Mr William Gerard, former chief executive of Hoffman
La Roche UK. In 1991, Medeva is expected to have made Pounds 15m profits
from sales of Pounds 80m and the share price has already risen this year by
a third to close at 297p yesterday, a multiple of 34 times 1991 earnings.
What is unique in the UK about Medeva is its attempt to become a significant
pharmaceuticals force without the kind of research and development
programmes undertaken by drug companies such as Glaxo and SmithKline
Beecham.
Its approach is to buy portfolios of drugs, or whole divisions from larger
companies - Medeva's purchase in January of 30 drugs from Glaxo is the
latest example. Medeva then re-markets the drugs, boosts prices and develops
or improves their delivery system.
This marketing-led formula is well-tried in the US by companies such as Ivax
and Forest Laboratories. Ivax was the second best performer on the US stock
exchange last year. Yet some analysts wonder whether Medeva can sustain
growth by simply buying and developing larger companies' older product
lines.
The larger Medeva becomes, they say, the more difficult it will be to find
portfolios of drugs large enough to have earnings impact but small enough
for the likes of Glaxo to be willing to sell. Medeva would increasingly need
to rely on organic growth from its acquired products and that record is
relatively untested.
Medeva's future depends to a large extent on the management continuing to
make sound judgments about what drugs and companies to acquire. Many
analysts believe the Gowrie-Smith/Taylor team can easily run a company with
market capitalisation substantially larger than Medeva's Pounds 580m.
But Medeva's longer-term strategy to exploit international markets and
develop its own products is more troublesome. Mr Gowrie-Smith admits
international growth will be hindered by national regulations and will not
fuel rapid earnings growth for Medeva over the next two years.
Medium-term growth, he argues, will come from the development of its own
products - for example, Medeva acquired the intellectual copyright of an
oral cholera and typhoid vaccine from Wellcome and Mr Gowrie-Smith says this
drug could be registered and in the market in two years.
This strategy moves Medeva and its research team into uncharted territory.
Mr Taylor heads a team that in pharmaceuticals terms is more experienced
than when Medeva's predecessor, Medirace, tried and failed to develop
Contracan, the cancer cure. Mr Gowrie-Smith accepts Medeva is still building
its drug development skill; he says Medeva will have to buy it as part of
its acquisition programme.
Medeva's supporters argue that the company's strategy is as valid now as
when it bought Evans Medical, a maker and distributor of vaccines and
generic pharmaceuticals, in 1990. The purchase turned the company from a
speculative drug developer into a drug manufacturing company with an
earnings stream. The purchase appeared all the more inspired last year when
Contracan was withdrawn from trials, after the US National Cancer Institute
said it demonstrated too little activity to justify further development.
The Evans acquisition also persuaded Mr Taylor to join Medeva. Replaced as
the chief executive of Glaxo by Dr Ernest Mario, Mr Taylor saw Medeva as a
vehicle to exploit opportunities too small for the large Glaxo.
Also in 1990, Medeva bought Thomas Kerfoot, a bulk unbranded pharmaceuticals
producer. Generic pharmaceuticals are the least rewarding of Medeva's
divisions because of intense competition. But had Medeva not made this
defensive acquisition it would now be facing a large cash drain, says Mr
Gowrie-Smith.
Adding Wellcome's vaccine portfolio in 1991 gave Medeva half the UK's
vaccine market by value; MD Pharmaceuticals of California, bought last May
for Dollars 77m, added methylphenidate, an anti-obesity drug. Then last
October, Medeva spent another Dollars 77m on Adams Laboratories, a producer
of of branded generic respiratory drugs.
The strategy, the quick purchases and Medeva's promise of big paper-financed
deals in the next two years has quickened investors' pulses. Yet a few think
Medeva has arrived too late; the US biotechnology and healthcare stock
bubble, on which companies such as Ivax rose, may be about to burst. If it
does, US institutional disenchantment might spill over into Medeva.
There again, Medeva may by that time have used its paper to make another
acquisition, taking the company a step closer to FTSE-100 status.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Deutsche Aerospace may take stake in Fokker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Aerospace, the aerospace arm of Daimler-Benz of Germany, may take a
substantial stake in Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, as part of a
new regional jet programme.
The move would have implications for the European regional aircraft market
which is facing acute competition and is in need of restructuring.
It would also shift alliances between European regional jet manufacturers
scrambling to rationalise activities through new industrial partnerships.
Fokker said yesterday it had agreed with Deutsche Aerospace to discuss a
'more intensified relationship' which would include, at least, co-operating
in the launch of a new 70 to 80-seater regional jet in late 1994, the Fokker
70. Fokker said direct investment by Deutsche Aerospace in Fokker's share
capital was also an option.
In Munich, Deutsche Aerospace confirmed its talks with Fokker but said no
agreement had been reached.
Fokker plans a Fl 500m (Pounds 156m) share issue next month to boost its
capital by 50 per cent. There was speculation yesterday Deutsche Aerospace
could use the issue to invest in Dutch aircraft manufacturer.
If Deutsche Aerospace takes up the entire issue, it would secure a 33 per
cent stake in Fokker's expanded share capital.
Analysts suggested Deutsche Aerospace might also buy out the Dutch
government, which holds 32 per cent of Fokker, giving the German group
control of Fokker.
Deutsche Aerospace's Messerschmitt subsidiary already co-operates with
Fokker by producing the fuselage of the Fokker 100 regional jet.
If Deutsche Aerospace strengthens ties with Fokker, it could mark a
significant shift in strategy which has focused on developing an 80 to
130-seat regional jet with Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy.
The German group appears reluctant to launch its Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds
1.42bn) programme with France and Italy in the difficult regional airline
environment.
Instead, it is considering working with Fokker on the new 70-seater aircraft
while supporting development by the European Airbus consortium of a smaller
125 to 130-seater derivative of the Airbus A320 twin-engine aircraft.
Deutsche Aerospace holds a 37.9 per cent stake in Airbus.
Like the Fokker 100, the Fokker 70 derivative will be powered by Rolls-Royce
Tay engines. Short Brothers of Northern Ireland, part of Canada's Bombardier
group, is expected to participate in the project.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Channel tunnel losses set at Pounds 12m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BICC yesterday became the first British contractor to announce provisions to
cover potential losses on the Channel tunnel project which has risen in cost
since 1987 from Pounds 4.7bn (Dollars 8.27bn) to more than Pounds 8bn.
The group said it had made a provision of Pounds 12m against work already
completed. The amounts were, however, covered by claims against Eurotunnel.
Contractors are claiming more than Pounds 1bn at 1985 prices to cover the
increased costs of building, whether completed or still outstanding. They
say costs have risen because of design changes introduced by Eurotunnel.
Mr Robin Biggam, BICC chairman, yesterday described talks between the
contractors and Eurotunnel as 'frosty'.
Contractors say that by mid-summer they will have insufficient cash flow to
carry on with construction. Transmanche Link (TML), a consortium of five
British and five French companies contracted to design and build the
project, has threatened to halt work unless it is paid sufficient to cover
at least the cost of the works.
BICC's provision is in line with its 10 per cent stake in TML which made a
total provision of Pounds 115m in its accounts for last year to cover work
so far. Other British members of the consortium - Costain, Wimpey, Tarmac
and Taylor Woodrow - are expected to reveal similar provisions in their
annual results in the next few weeks.
None of the five French construction companies in TML has identified
provisions for tunnel losses.
However, Bouygues, Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez, Spie Batignolles, SGE and SAE,
have privately indicated to stockbroking analysts that they have provided
for between Pounds 13m and Pounds 15m each for last year.

FT  05 MAR 92 / White House steps up pressureon Buchanan to withdraw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE White House, smarting from another humiliation at the polls for
President George Bush, yesterday increased the pressure on Mr Pat Buchanan,
his rightwing challenger, to withdraw from the race.
Mr Buchanan, the television commentator and former Nixon speechwriter, won
36 per cent of the vote in Tuesday's Georgia primary, against 64 per cent
for Mr Bush. Mr Buchanan's performance almost equalled his 37 per cent in
New Hampshire two weeks ago.
Mr Buchanan also took 30 per cent of the vote in Maryland and Colorado,
confirming that his campaign is not simply going to fade away.
The White House fears that Mr Buchanan's success has exposed deep divisions
within the Republican party and threatens to weaken Mr Bush when he faces a
Democratic challenger in November's presidential election.
Some Republican party leaders believe Mr Buchanan's eyes are on the 1996
presidential race, and that he does not entertain any real hope of taking
this year's nomination from President Bush. If that is so, they argue, he
must sooner or later make peace with the rest of the party. 'We got the
message. Now it's time for him to get the message: stop dividing the party,'
said a White House official.
But Mr Buchanan yesterday insisted he had no intention of pulling out of the
race. Instead, he said, he would continue his campaign up to the August
convention. 'I think we're now going to go all the way to that Houston
convention,' he said.
Mr Bush has until now dismissed Mr Buchanan's support as a protest vote. On
Tuesday night he chose to interpret his challenger's support as a protest
vote directed at politicians in general, not just his own record in office.
'To those who have been with me in the past but did not vote for me today, I
hear your concerns and understand your frustration with Washington,' he said
in a statement issued from the White House.
Yesterday, however, he acknowledged that people were actually voting against
him.
'It seems to be that way, yes. I think that's a good way to analyse it. But
that will turn round,' Mr Bush said before leaving for Florida and six days
of intensive campaigning.
'People will see that I'm the person to lead this country, just as I was in
the past.'
Republican leaders such as Mr Newt Gingrich, the party's whip in the House
of Representatives, acknowledge that Mr Bush's campaign is still in trouble.
'There's no question Bush has got problems. It's obvious in the returns.
It's obvious in the economy.'
Mr Buchanan has been campaigning heavily in South Carolina, which holds its
primary on Saturday, and is also expected to win support in the conservative
southern states which dominate next week's 11-state Super Tuesday contest.
In the Democratic race, Tuesday's voting in seven states confirmed the
emergence of two clear frontrunners: Mr Paul Tsongas, the lugubrious former
senator from Massachusetts, who won in Maryland, Utah and Washington state,
and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who won heavily in Georgia. Mr Jerry
Brown, the former governor of California, won a surprising victory in
Colorado.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa kept his faltering campaign alive by winning at
party caucuses in Minnesota and Idaho. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska failed
to win anywhere and yesterday cancelled his scheduled appearances in
Florida. He is considering the future of his candidacy.

FT  05 MAR 92 / SIB bows to life companies' lobbying: Plan to require sales
agents to disclose policy charges is dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Invest-ments Board has bowed to pressure and withdrawn
plans to require life assurance sales agents to disclose their own
companies' charges to customers. Such a move would have made it easier for
consumers to shop around.
Instead, the SIB, the City's chief investment regulator, will announce next
week that sales agents only have to tell customers the average cost of
similar policies sold by all insurance companies and make projections about
how much those charges will offset investment returns over the life of the
policy.
Consumers thus will have no easy basis for determining whether they are
purchasing the product of a high-cost or a low-cost producer.
The rules are part of a review of the disclosure regime required for life
insurance companies and others, such as unit trust companies, who sell
retail financial products.
The SIB has been under pressure from the UK's largest insurance companies,
which mainly sell 'with profits' policies, to back off from its original
plan to make each company disclose its own costs.
The with-profits companies have persuaded the SIB that it would be
impossible to guess what costs will be many years into the future.
The SIB is also believed to have backed away from one of its more
controversial plans to require companies to spell out costs simply in pounds
and pence, expressed as either a reduction in investment return or as a
reduction in premiums paid. Instead, it has agreed a formula that will
satisfy some objections of the insurance industry which urged that costs
simply be expressed as a percentage.
The new rules, however, will offer some aid to consumers by requiring
companies to tell prospective customers how much of their premium payments
they will lose if they cancel within the first five years of a policy's
life.
The rules will also require sales agents to disclose the so-called
'cross-over point' - the year in which a policy holder can expect to get
back all premiums paid, albeit without any investment income, if the policy
is terminated.
Because sales agents receive their full commission when a policy is sold,
policyholders are charged selling costs in the early years of their
contract.
This 'front-ending' of costs means that holders of 20-year endowment
policies must pay premiums regularly for seven to 10 years before they are
entitled to a 100 per cent refund, according to figures compiled by Lautro,
the self-regulatory body for life assurance and unit trust sales agents.
The new rules on disclosure are part of a wide-ranging package of reforms
currently under review by both SIB and Lautro. The review follows a judgment
by the Office of Fair Trading that life assurance companies' failure to tell
prospective customers how much they are being charged was anti-competitive.
Consumers, however, will be offered some basis for comparison by new rules
which will require companies to disclose so-called surrender values of
policies, showing just how much of each year's premium is retained to cover
sales costs in the early years of a policy.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Lloyd's inquiry starts as insider row grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR David Walker's independent committee investigating Lloyd's meets for the
first time this morning amid mounting controversy about whether insiders had
an unfair advantage in trading at the insurance market.
Official Lloyd's figures show that nine catastrophe reinsurance syndicates
which face serious losses in 1989 contained a disproportionately low number
of working Names, individuals who have at some time had jobs with agencies,
syndicates and brokers at Lloyd's.
Names are the individuals whose personal assets back underwriting at the
insurance market.
Equally, of the six most profitable syndicates in 1988 - the last year for
which final results are available - five contain significantly more than
their proportionate share of working Names.
However, trends emerging from the data, which Lloyd's is to make available
to all Names, are so far not as clear-cut as these isolated statistics make
it appear.
For example, a number of syndicates attracting large numbers of working
Names performed badly in 1988.
Syndicate 764, an average-sized marine syndicate made a loss of more than
three times its premium income when it increased its reserves against future
claims from asbestosis and pollution. Of its 624 Names, 259 - about 40 per
cent - are working members, giving it the fifth-highest proportion of
apparent insiders in the market.
Taking the 10 syndicates with the highest proportion of working Names in
1988, however, seven returned profits for their Names. Over 35 per cent of
the 581 Names on syndicate 45, which was the market's best performer in
1988, are working members.
Lloyd's has admitted that some syndicates with a greater than average
participation of external Names have incurred heavy losses from catastrophe
business. However, it insists that in the market as a whole working Names do
not benefit to the detriment of outsiders.
It says that the conclusions of a recent extensive investigation into
business practices at Lloyd's, which show that on average outside Names
obtained better results than working Names in two of the last three years,
are still valid.
Further problems with interpreting the data include:
The fact that not all working Names still have jobs at the market. They
include a number of working Names who have retired or who had only fleeting
involvement.
Syndicates that have performed outstandingly well or badly are
unrepresentative of the market's overall composition. All six of the most
profitable syndicates in 1988 were smaller than the average which is
capitalised at about Pounds 27.5m. Relatives of working Names are
categorised as outsiders even though, it is alleged by Lloyd's critics, they
have preferential access to better syndicates and information.
It is believed that some categories of working Names - underwriters - do
better than others, for example, brokers.
The composition of Sir David's committee came under fresh attack last night
in a letter to Mr Coleridge from Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City affairs
spokeswoman.
Ms Mowlam questioned the suitability of Mr John Lock and Mr Leslie Lucas,
two of the four committee members. These individuals 'represent companies
which are deeply involved in the LMX (reinsurance) spiral and any
confirmation of allegations concerning possible malpractice and
mismanagement might have a direct bearing on their firms.'
Mr Lock is chairman of Mercantile and General, Britain's largest commercial
reinsurer. Mr Lucas is chief executive of Norwich Winterthur Reinsurance. Ms
Mowlam also questioned the involvement of Mr Jonathan Foster, a member of
Lloyd's legal department. who is to act as secretary.
The other two members are Sir William Clark MP, chairman of the Conservative
backbench finance committee and a consultant to Commercial Union Assurance,
and Mr Peter Mynors, a senior partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Surely the foreign exchange market is in danger of over doing its love
affair with the dollar. The latest US indicators may point to recovery, but
it is hard to see the economy roaring ahead to the point where short-term
interest rates have to be raised in an election year. Thus, there seems
little justification for extending the surge which took the dollar over
DM1.67 and Y132 in late European trading yesterday.
Some appreciation of the US currency was inevitable as the prospect of still
lower US interest rates receded. It has been fuelled recently by a rise in
Treasury bond yields which has restored their attraction to international
investors. That could continue to underpin the dollar, but a further strong
advance does not seem justified, at least against the D-Mark. The Bundesbank
will hardly relish the inflationary impulse from a weak German currency.
The yen's case is different, not least because Japanese investors seem to
have lost all faith in their own stock market. So the Bank of Japan will
remain under pressure to cut interest rates. That is not the only reason why
yesterday's intervention left the market unimpressed. Local institutions are
covering short dollar positions ahead of the financial year-end. Last but
not least, the yen is scarcely helped by the capital outflow going to redeem
the plethora of equity-linked bonds launched in Europe in the mid-1980s.

FT  05 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: GKN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN's principal argument for maintaining its dividend in the face of a 45
per cent drop in pre-tax profits appears to be that careful cash management
during the recession has left its balance sheet in excellent shape. Gearing
has dropped to 26 per cent from 32 per cent, thanks to a squeeze on both
working capital and capital spending. Yet its total dividend payment for
this year will consume nearly all the Pounds 55m reduction in working
capital, while it is only 0.7 times covered by earnings per share.
That might matter less if there were any real prospect of recovery in the
group's major markets in 1992. As it is, GKN itself scarcely expects any
rise in European car production this year and when recovery eventually
comes, it will bring with it a fresh demand for cash. Stocks will increase
again, and the company will have to rebuild its hire stock which has been
run down because of the recession.
Once investors have got over their relief at the maintained dividend, they
might therefore ponder whether it made sense to mark the shares up by 6 per
cent yesterday. Dividend cover is unlikely to return to its normal two-times
before 1994. Any increase in payout is thus a long way off, although there
may still be some support from a yield approaching 8 per cent.

FT  05 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market appeared a little ungrateful in marking down shares in Cadbury
Schweppes yesterday. Despite the recession, Cadbury's annual results were
better than even last September's interim figures had hinted. Pre-tax
profits rose by 13 per cent although sales were flat. Spending on marketing
and advertising was increased to protect its brands, while a series of
one-off provisions for management restructurings was easily absorbed. The
group's financial position continued to improve; gearing at 40 per cent has
fallen by a third since 1989. After capital spending, tax and dividends
there was a cash inflow last year of more than Pounds 30m.
Given the performance of the typical UK company through this recession, it
would be churlish to describe Cadbury as anything other than a class act.
Old questions such as how the reliance on UK and Australasia for 60 per cent
of trading profit can be reduced still carry some residual weight. The
growth of its European operations is not as vigorous, particularly in
confectionery, as management would perhaps have hoped, but the group is big
enough these days to be patient.
The market may occasionally believe that Cadbury's earnings growth rate is
too low to justify the premium rating of the shares, but the company is
treated as something of a special case. The quality of its earnings and
hopes of eventual takeover place the shares squarely in that select category
which should only be sold in dire emergency.

FT  05 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: BICC's cable from the contractors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,558.4 (-7.0)
The Channel tunnel is more than just a hole in the ground, judging by BICC's
confirmation that the TML consortium lost Pounds 115m in 1991. The figure
itself will have come as little surprise to the market, which is working on
the not unreasonable assumption that the bitter claims dispute with
Eurotunnel will end in the warring parties splitting the difference. What
was more alarming yesterday was BICC's gloomy perception that there is still
no solution in sight.
BICC shareholders, though, may wish to focus their attention on their
company's rather less publicised property black hole. It may well be that
the Pounds 30m provision for projects completed, or close to completion,
turns out to be a conservative one, but the housing land bank and long-term
Spitalfields scheme remain genuine worries for the longer term. BICC is not
the first to have made a hash of property, but it is a sobering thought that
net cash of Pounds 150m was invested in land and property development
between 1987 and 1990.
Without it there would now be a lot more room for manoeuvre in the balance
sheet, which is roughly 80 per cent geared if the convertible is treated as
debt and off balance sheet loans with recourse to BICC are taken into
account.
The immediate outlook is hardly exciting, given that the European cables
business clearly weakened in last year's second half. BICC ought to be able
to make Pounds 130m pre exceptionals in 1992, but it will be some time
before the dividend is increased. At 323p the shares need their 8 per cent
yield.

In the days when there was something called an economic debate, any one of
the books in the adjoining panel would have provided scope for vigorous
discussion. Today when there are too many books, but insufficient time and
attention for them, I have no choice but to indulge in a wrap-up article - a
form beloved by literary editors but which I normally much dislike.
There is, however, a sort of historical progression among these particular
books. John Fforde's official history of the Bank of England covers the
post-war period up to the end of the 1950s. Sir Alec Cairncross has marked
his 80th birthday by writing, editing or contributing towards no fewer than
three volumes. The Legacy of the Golden Age refers to the 1960s and reports
a birthday conference.
The book that he has co-authored on the IMF crisis of 1976 draws on an
earlier first-hand account by Edmund Dell, who was Trade Secretary at the
time and almost the only Cabinet minister who believed in the IMF programme
 -the others believed in lip service at most. Dell's book has a freshness
and on-the-spot quality which no subsequent historian could hope to match.
The nakedness of the British Keynesian economic establishment in the face of
stagflation (unemployment plus inflation) comes out in this episode. Dell
brings out how split and helpless the Treasury had become, with Sir Douglas
Wass, the permanent secretary, and the economists fundamentally sympathetic
to Labour's resistance, and the overseas officials wanting to make fresh
spending cuts for vague reasons of confidence. An ironic feature is that
Dell was more in favour of Denis Healey's pro-IMF position than Healey
himself, who could not wait to declare what he elegantly called 'sod-off
day' with the Fund. As for his later claim that the agonies would have been
unnecessary with better forecasts of the Budget and balance of payments
deficits, Dell remarks: 'One measure of successful economic management is
independence of forecasting errors.'
The most disappointing volume, with the exception of James Buchanan's
contribution, is that in which eminent economists give their 'life
philosophies'. The editor, Michael Szenberg, has somehow caught the wrong
generation. These are the first generation of economists at or nearing
retirement, who aspired to see in their subject a hard science. Many of them
profess to be bewildered, flattered or amazed at being asked for such
essays. They give us everything from a potted history of their own research
to folk wisdom and bizarre homespun metaphysical systems. Their politics
show a yearning for active government or market socialism, even though quite
a few of them have their roots in central and eastern Europe. The long and
variable lags in publishing mean that they have not been forced to take on
board events in their homeland.
Mention of long and variable lags brings me to what, despite all differences
about the ERM, is the one of these books that I would take to a desert
island, that by Milton Friedman. It also has the longest historical sweep
from 'stone money' at the dawn of history to US 'bimetallist' advocates of a
combined silver and gold standard and the choices facing countries trying to
stabilise prices after decades of many-digit inflation; and it gives an
accessible account of Friedman's main positive ideas.
But the student of British economic policy must earn his right to read
Friedman under a palm tree by first reading how monetary policy was seen by
the post-war Bank. Fforde, a former Bank economist and executive director,
attracted attention in the early 1980s with his outspoken objections to the
Thatcher government's monetarism as a form of theology of which the Bank
wanted no part. In this history he shows himself as sceptical towards the
Bank's own pieties.
The whole book can be read as an argument for an independent and accountable
Bank, with much emphasis on the second adjective. But it is an argument
based not on an admiration for the Bank's positive performance, but rather
the opposite. As early as 1945, the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Graham
Towers, wrote to Lord Keynes: 'The half-way arrangement under which the
central bank is neither a department of government pure and simple, nor
directly responsible to the public for its actions, may contain the worst
elements of both worlds.' Fforde himself writes of the Bank's tendering of
advice to the government in private, 'to the probable detriment of public
understanding of important issues'. And its emphasis on its role as an
intermediary between Whitehall and the banking system 'brought little
advantage to either'. Just so.
There is also a mild sort of bete noire in his story in the unlikely shape
of Lucius Thompson McCausland, a self-taught adviser to the Governors, who
had the temerity not to have an economics degree, but who was attached to
'ingenious schemes'. As far as I remember, the 'Maudling Plan' for dealing
with the imagined shortage of international liquidity which he devised in
the 1960s was no worse than any other.
This new history is also a quarry of information on the ill-fated Operation
Robot - a plan to make sterling convertible at a floating rate in 1952,
vetoed by Churchill on Lord Cherwell's advice. The choice between a domestic
and an external monetary constraint is a matter of time and place and I have
always had a retrospective sympathy for Robot, which is quite consistent
with later support for the European Monetary System. A floating and
convertible pound in the 1950s might have brought forward by two or three
decades the dash for economic freedom without the need for the passions of
the Thatcher era.
The part of the book with greatest contemporary relevance is oddly enough
the early part which deals with the Bank's profoundly unsatisfactory
response to post-war nationalisation, when it had an opportunity to seek
clearly defined responsibilities, but confined its attention to the narrower
question of statutory powers over banks. Indeed, my own earliest memories of
the Bank was the passion with which some of the directors felt that bank
lending should be regulated neither by interest rates nor by controls, but
by the Governor and his subordinates talking gentleman-to-gentleman to the
clearing banks. Even then it was obvious that this approach, besides being
repellent, had no chance of surviving the advent of newcomers from outside
the club. But what an abdication from the great issues of the day to
concentrate on this client relationship] Another memory of those days is of
Sir Maurice Parsons, a deputy Governor (who became 'morose, difficult' and
worse after the 1967 devaluation), complaining that I had asked very
politely to see the information on which his sweeping judgments were based.
Indeed, as I recount in my own contribution to the Cairncross inquest on the
1960s, it was the appallingly bad case put up by the advocates of sound
money in the Bank and elsewhere which made me believe at the time in
growthmanship, ie: using rapid demand expansion to stimulate industry into
more vigorous performance. The demonstration that the end result would be
inflation without more growth or jobs came from Friedman, while the Bank was
mainly preoccupied with the immorality of letting down sterling balance
holders.
For a synoptic view of all the post-war era, including the 1980s, we return
again to Cairncross. Has all the agonising been about nothing? Cairncross in
the conclusion to his economic history points out how steady the British
economic growth rate has been, at about 2 1/4 per cent per annum over many
decades. The striking feature is how continental growth rates have fallen
from earlier highs; so that the period started with lamentations about the
British growth gap and ended with disputes about whether the gap had been
closed in the 1980s. In terms of output per head of population the
differences were nothing like as great as popularly supposed. He remarks
that the great failure has been not growth, but the fading of full
employment.
Cairncross adds: 'Most of the reasons why governments intervene relate to
infrastructure, health, the environment, monopolistic influence, and so on,
not to innovation and productivity.' Would this were all]
He is sceptical about claims that events would have been different under
different policies. 'We find in government a convenient scapegoat for
outcomes of which we disapprove.' He believes that national governments will
occupy less and less of the stage; and so far as we look to policies at all,
they will have to come from institutions, which are international in
character. Such institutions seem to me to be even more cumbersome, slow
moving, and bound to last year's fashions than the national variety. But we
shall survive.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Leading Article: A charter for passengers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PASSENGER'S Charter yesterday drew into the platform almost six months
later than scheduled. The reason for the delay was not leaves on the track
or the wrong kind of snow so much as the difficulty of finding money to fund
the scheme. If passengers are to be paid compensation for service failures,
British Rail must either find the money from lower investment or higher
fares - in either case rebounding on the passengers it is intended to help.
The charter therefore emphasises prevention rather than cure.
For example, each of the 15 main commuter routes into London is to be set
'challenging but achievable' targets for reliability and punctuality which
will reflect the investment which has gone into it. Failure to meet the
targets will lead to automatic discounts for commuters on the cost of
renewing season tickets. Each line's progress will be monitored on a monthly
basis, so that managers have the opportunity to improve performance and
avoid payouts.
Hard-pressed commuters on unmodernised lines such as that between Southend
and London's Fenchurch Street station will no doubt welcome any incentive
for BR managers to reduce the level of misery created by continual delays
and cancellations. But the London arrangements will not automatically apply
to commuters in other conurbations where local rail services are the
responsibility of Passenger Transport Executives.
Existing scheme
On other parts of the railway network, yesterday's charter may offer less
compensation than is available under the existing discretionary and
little-publicised scheme. For example, while the charter specifies
compensation for trains which are excessively delayed, no recompense is
offered if trains are unheated in cold weather (as is sometimes available
under the present scheme). And compensation will be in vouchers against the
cost of future travel, rather than in cash.
All of this is understandable if the aim is to persuade rail managers to be
more attentive to passengers' needs without incurring extra expenditure. But
the only long-term solution to the failure of state ownership to provide an
acceptable level of service is to open the railways to private capital and
competitive pressures.
Like the passenger's charter, the government's plans to privatise BR have
been running unconscionably late. In this case, the delay has been to good
purpose, since it has allowed ministers to examine and reject the favoured
strategy of selling off profitable operations such as InterCity complete
with trains and tracks. This would have left each operation as a monopoly,
and made it hard to privatise parts of the network which cannot be
profitable when competing with roads that are free at the point of use.
Piecemeal procedure
Now ministers plan to proceed piecemeal, beginning by removing BR's monopoly
over the provision of rail services. With more than a dozen private
operators queueing up to run trains on the network, an element of
competition could be introduced quickly. That would be followed by the sale
of profitable operations such as InterCity without their tracks. Loss-making
services would be franchised to the bidder prepared to accept the lowest
subsidy. Ultimately, BR itself would dwindle to a track authority, with
responsibility for centralised functions such as safety, timetabling and
ticketing.
This divorce of the ownership of trains from the ownership of track offers a
significant benefit. If the government would accept responsibility for the
latter - as it does for roads - the charging structure for both could be put
on a comparable basis. Much more of the rail network would then offer
profitable opportunities for business.
It would also place UK rail operators in a strong position if the European
Commission proceeds with plans to separate train operation from track
infrastructure across the EC. If British train operators have become
accustomed to competing on the UK railways, they will enjoy competitive
advantage in any deregulated European rail market.

CAPE FEAR (18) Empire
ONCE UPON A CRIME (PG) Odeon Marble Arch
MEN OF RESPECT (18) MGM Oxford St
JOHN CASSAVETES SEASON ICA
Do we need the sight of a great modern film-maker jumping out at us from
behind a camera and saying 'Boo]'? This in essence is the experience
provided by Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear. There are more gratuitous coups de
cinema per minute than there are quills per inch upon a fretful porcupine.
Remaking the 1962 hoodlum-at-large thriller that starred Gregory Peck and
Robert Mitchum, Scorsese provides a lexicon of visual ingenuities. Jump
cuts, painted skies, zoom-in-track-outs, rearing crane shots (even in
intimate conversation scenes), colour mutating to monochrome . . . Yet that
is all the film sometimes seems like: a lexicon. One is reminded of Bruce
Willis's breathless aside in The Last Boy Scout when he and his chum are
attacked by a loquaciously abusive baddie: 'Feels like we're being beaten up
by the inventor of Scrabble.'
Scorsese's game is Movie Scrabble. You win a double-quote-score for wryly
invoking the original Cape Fear, as when an ageing Peck and Mitchum stroll
into cameo roles as sleazy lawyer and Southern sheriff respectively. And you
win a triple-quote-score if, like Robert De Niro as the vengeful ex-convict
who pursues and psychologically torments the defence lawyer who failed him
(Nick Nolte) plus his wife (Jessica Lange) and nubile daughter (Juliette
Lewis), you can pay tribute to as many roles and actors as possible.
De Niro's Max Cady is one part Mitchum - more The Night Of The Hunter than
Cape Fear - to several large parts of Lionel Barrymore and GD Spradlin. With
his Hawaian shirt, airport sun-glasses and loony ebullience, he also
suggests Fred Flintstone on a works outing to Florida. (The nominal setting
is North Carolina but the film was shot, and looks like it, around Fort
Lauderdale). The movie is fun, but is it art? Like any good game of Scrabble
it is at least for a while diverting. From the first image in the titles
sequence - the camera rising from primeval waters to cue jagged letters
against a riverswept background - Scorsese is determined to go Gothic.
Hammer-horror cloudscapes lower over Nolte and Lange's handsome mansion;
deep-focus effects pay homage to Citizen Kane; and fairy-tale ghoulishness
is invoked in the queasy scene where De Niro, luring Miss Lewis's pubescent
teenager to the school basement cum makeshift theatre, plays Big Bad Wolf to
her Red Riding Hood with a mock-up gingerbread cottage behind him. This duel
of innuendo between a shyly ripening girl and a slippery psychopath - we
have already seen him brutalise a woman and bite a chunk from her cheek -
has a quietly hypnotic power.
But typically of this cleverer-than-thou thriller Miss Lewis, unlike her
1962 predecessor, is no innocent. Coming 30 years on to the same story
(based on John D MacDonald's novel The Executioners), Scorsese and
screenwriter Wesley Strick feel they must muddy the Manichean waters of good
guys versus bad. But in doing so, they also muddy its dramatic clarity of
purpose.
Nolte and Lange are an overwritten problem couple with an over-telegraphed
problem daughter. He is a he-man repressed by small-town life, his small
eyes penned in behind wire-rim specs. She is a designer with a Lange-ian
line in tremulous hysteria.
They are clearly in such deep domestic turmoil already - with his
infidelities and her keening reproaches - that the arrival of Mr Madman from
the Slammer would seem a minor addition to their problems. Possibly even a
welcome diversion. As a result the violent finale aboard a drifting,
waveswept houseboat - where De Niro keeps bobbing back to life in the best
ghoul-can't-help-it tradition - has the frivolous excitement of a fairground
ride rather than the visceral horror of a face-to-face with death.
With no sense of emotional hazard there is no sense of suspense. Instead of
a horrified 'Ah no]' in response to scenes, we keep mouthing an admiring 'Ah
yes]' The director who crafted Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and GoodFellas is
here aided by a good cameraman (Freddie Francis) and a great production
designer (Henry Bumstead of Vertigo). But all that results is that the
tunnel-vision intensity the tale requires is ousted by decorative overkill.
This even extends to the star player. De Niro lolls across the CinemaScope
screen as if determined to colonise every inch of it. He snarls and croons
and teases; he savours his Southern accent like fine wine. He is a
vaudeville charmer in a vaudeville thriller. His only saving grace is that,
unlike everyone else in the film, he seems to know it is a deep dark joke
and not to be taken seriously as a spinechiller-turned-psychodrama.
Worse, far worse, is the Euro-comedy Once Upon A Crime. What a title. They
probably came up with it after rejecting Sweet Sistine and Abandon Pope for
this Rome-set plot about a murder, a valuable dachshund and six
second-magnitude stars hurtling about delivering dead dialogue. They include
Cybill Shepherd, James Belushi, Sean Young, John Candy and an
embarrassed-looking George Hamilton wearing boot polish as a tanned,
over-age toyboy.
Did I say Rome? Well, it begins there, then moves to Monte Carlo. But by
this stage the Press show audience was being examined by a doctor for signs
of rigor mortis. Startlingly, or perhaps not, three writers are credited
with having struggled over the script. The best dialogue exchange - 'Are you
finished?", 'No, I'm Swedish' - will give you a measure of the rest. Eugene
Levy directed.
Men Of Respect is Macbeth remade as a Mafia thriller. Dr Jonathan Miller is
to blame for all this. Dear me, the cultural cost of that Rigoletto. Here we
have Rod Steiger and Peter Boyle among the Cosa Nostra bigwigs, John 'Barton
Fink' Turturro as the modern Macbeth ('No man born of woman can do shit to
me') and Katherine Borowitz as a Mafiosa Lady M given to scouring the
bathroom with bleach. Meanwhile Banquo is called Banky, MacDuff Duffy and
Malcolm Mal. When they do Hamlet it will no doubt be Hammy, Ophie and Gert.
William Reilly wrote and directed.
Far better to visit the ICA's John Cassavetes season, running for one more
week. The wild man of American cinema, who died last year, made films that
were like the fearless, flailing revelations of a patient under truth serum.
He wrote his own stories - of marital break-up and nervous breakdown, of
high and low living on the Bohemian fringes - and had them improvised into
life by his handpicked repertory of actor-friends. Ben Gazzara, Peter Falk,
Gena Rowlands, himself: his favourite stars kept being recycled in plots
that were as untidy as Columbo's mac and as challengingly, endearingly
human. Shadows, Faces, A Woman Under The Influence, The Killing Of A Chinese
Bookie. The best is here. Catch it while you can.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Arts: The Pocket Dream - Albery Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charlie Chaplin used to say that all he needed to make a comedy was a park,
a policeman and a pretty girl. A short-staffed performance of A Midsummer
Night's Dream at the Albery finds Mike McShane and Sandi Toksvig reduced to
a similar minimalism in their very funny Pocket Dream. The play is based on
the single idea of short-handed Shakespeare, and has just enough stamina to
last the evening.
Shortened Shakespeare is nothing new: the 'Skinhead Hamlet' runs to three
pages in the Faber Book of Parodies; and in the theatre, Tom Stoppard's
Dogg's Hamlet and Cahoot's Macbeth are distinctly succinct. What The Pocket
Dream offers is a cast of five taking on 18 parts and delivering most of the
essentials of Shakespeare without ever trespassing on seriousness.
The play starts in crisis; 16 of the cast have repaired to the local pub,
the theatre manager has placed the evening's box office on a greyhound in
Catford, and the audience (played here by the audience) wants either a show
or its money back. The Stage Manager (Sandi Toksvig) and the Front of House
Manager (Mike McShane) decide the performance must continue. Add the PE
teacher boyfriend (Lee Simpson) of the leading actress (Louisa Rix), an
overdone leading man (Phelim McDermott) and an ursine stage-hand (Clive
Mantle), and high jinks ensue.
The plot follows Shakespeare, but the atmosphere on stage is made so
informal by Toksvig and McShane, that the funniest moments of the evening
come from watching them get back on terms with the real play. The gags range
from the smutty ('I haven't had my legs this wide in years') to the witty
('I have never been so insulted' - 'Oh, you should get out more'); there is
even space for the Buster Keaton falling wall gag. The set is supposed to be
basic provincial repertory, although the artificial grass seems unkind.
However, the show belongs to McShane, the bulk of the evening. From the
first unwilling speech wrested from him ('I'm outta here'), he threatens to
descend to new levels of anarchy each time he appears.
Toksvig, who co-wrote with Elly Brewer, dovetails the backstage madness into
the Shakespeare, manages some lively slapstick as Puck on a trapeze, and
strikes up a fine rapport with both McShane and the excellent Clive Mantle.
The audience has a chance to assist in the debacle of Pyramus and Thisbe,
principally in the form of sound effects which have the stalls on their feet
in an extravagant Mexican lion's roar, the galleries barking and the dress
circle waving torches. There are even some lines to be spoken collectively;
so if, as Prince Philip reportedly said, one can be forgiven a great deal if
one can quote Shakespeare in an economic crisis, then absolution is at hand
in the Albery.

FT  05 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Tribunal explains ruling in case of
women brokers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDUSTRIAL tribunal battle between currency swaps broker Ms Liliane
Preisler and her boss, Miss Cindy Buggins, ended yesterday with the judgment
that neither party had impressed the hearing's chairman 'as entirely
reliable witnesses of truth'.
The tribunal ruled at the end of last year that Ms Preisler's treatment by
City-based Euro Brokers Capital Markets over her maternity leave had not
constituted sexual discrimination. It agreed, however, that she had been
constructively dismissed and was owed money by her employers.
Yesterday the tribunal provided detailed reasons for its decision. In
particular, it found that Ms Preisler had not been discriminated against
when six of her best clients were taken away from her during her nine
months' maternity leave. The redistribution of her client list 'was a proper
exercise of management authority'.
The case received much publicity because of the clash of personalities
involved and the glimpse it gave of high-earning City life. Ms Preisler
received a basic salary of Pounds 70,000, plus bonuses and perks. This
amounted to an estimated annual income of Pounds 150,000.
The tribunal said that 'when Ms Preisler returned to work, although Miss
Buggins wanted to keep her, she was nevertheless determined to cut her down
to size and render her more tractable, in which endeavour she failed by
pushing her too far'.
It added: 'Whether this was also the reason for the removal from her list of
her more important customers, it is impossible to know.'
Ms Preisler alleged she was passed over for promotion because of her
pregnancy, but the tribunal agreed with her boss that she was not a suitable
candidate for promotion.
Ms Preisler, who says she is owed more than Pounds 30,000 in unpaid bonuses
and maternity entitlement, has proceedings pending in the High Court. Her
award from the tribunal has been limited to one month's salary - which will
probably reach the maximum amount of Pounds 10,000 a tribunal can award.
Euro Brokers has yet to decide whether it will appeal against the tribunal's
findings.

FT  05 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): AEU threatens to 'walk out' of TUC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AEU engineering union could leave the Trades Union Congress, Mr Gavin
Laird, the union's general secretary, warned yesterday as he revealed that
his members and those of the EETPU electricians' union had voted
overwhelmingly to merge.
Speaking on BBC radio he said the AEU 'may walk out of the TUC front door'
if other unions behaved 'stupidly' over terms to readmit the EETPU after a
three-year absence. His comments marked the first skirmish in what is likely
to be a year of heated negotiations between the TUC and the merged
organisation, which will be Britain's second-largest union.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of the Nalgo local government union,
said the EETPU would have to give up members it had 'poached' from other
unions before it could be readmitted to the TUC. Leaders of the Amalgamated
Engineering and Electrical Union - as the new organisation will be called -
 -have said they will not hand over members.
In the merger ballots 86.5 per cent of AEU voters and 84.5 per cent of EETPU
voters favoured merging. The turnout was 36 per cent among 595,000 engineers
and 41 per cent among 349,000 electricians.
The merger, to go ahead in May, will have significant implications for
industrial relations in manufacturing. It is expected to ease demarcation
disputes between craft workers and simplify bargaining.
In the next few months the most likely visible effect of the merger will be
on the TUC. Leaders of the AEEU have promised members a vote on affiliation
within a year.
Mr Paul Gallagher, EETPU general secretary elect, who will take over Mr
Laird's role as general secretary in the enlarged union in two years, said
yesterday that the TUC would have to demonstrate that the Pounds 1.3m annual
affiliation fees were worth it.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, welcomed the merger and said he
hoped to conclude talks with the AEEU quickly. One national trade union
centre was essential for exerting maximum influence.
Outstanding issues include whether the EETPU should pay affiliation fees for
its time out of the TUC and whether it should withdraw from the two
single-union deals for which it was expelled.

FT  05 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Nalgo delegates back plan for merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of Nalgo, the local government union, said yesterday that delegates
at a special conference had overwhelmingly backed plans for the creation
through merger of Britain's largest union by the summer of next year.
Motions to block the plans were withdrawn and the union's leadership said
that the passing of amendments on the way the union collects subscriptions
was unlikely to delay the merger significantly.
The conference's decision to retain branch collection of subscriptions will
irritate Nupe and Cohse, the other unions involved in the merger. Both
collect subscriptions nationally and want the same system in the new union.
However, yesterday's decision will allow branches to opt for central
subscription. Nalgo believes this would enable it to forge a compromise with
the two partners.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, Nalgo general secretary, said he expected the merger
plans to go to a vote of his 1.4m members by autumn. An amalgamation could
then go ahead in July next year.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Forth Ports set to raise Pounds 35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is ex-pected to raise Pounds 35m through the Stock Exchange
flotation of Forth Ports Authority, the trust port operator on the Firth of
Forth. The share offer for the port - the seventh biggest in the UK in terms
of the volume of cargo handled - will open on March 12 and close on March
18.
The sale is the only public flotation so far in the privatisation of the
trust ports. It was boosted this week by the decision of the Scottish Office
to negotiate a lease on a Pounds 35m building in Leith, the port of
Edinburgh, which will be developed on port land by a subsidiary of Forth
Ports.
Some 1,400 civil servants will move to a 290,000 sq ft building from New St
Andrew's House in the centre of Edinburgh, which has been found to contain
asbestos. The Scottish secretary and top civil servants will remain in
nearby St Andrew's House.
Forth Ports operates the ports of Leith, Grangemouth, Burntisland,
Kirkcaldy, Methil and Granton. Much of its activity involves chemicals and
crude oil. Turnover last year was a record Pounds 32.4m.
The directors of Forth Ports decided to attempt a flotation to ensure its
management team remained intact, something which might have been threatened
if it had been privatised.
The government, which gave its permission in January, will take the
proceeds.
Last year Forth Ports made pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.6m. With the capital
reconstruction, which involves converting current cash balances into gearing
of 34 per cent, the company would have had pro forma results of Pounds 6.2m
pre-tax profits, earnings per 50p share of 13.42p and net assets of Pounds
32.7m.
The directors see prospects for growth from a generally stable level of
activity, although turnover will fall this year because of a decline in
orders for British Pipe Coaters, which treats pipes at Leith.
British Linen Bank, the merchant banking arm of Bank of Scotland, is
offering 27m 50p ordinary shares likely to be priced at about Pounds 1.30
each. A further 3m shares, making 10 per cent of the company, will be
reserved for employees.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Crowded commuters unmoved by scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMUTERS ON Britain's worst railway line were yesterday unimpressed at
joining the chartering classes. Those on the crowded 16.40 London Fenchurch
Street to Stanford-le-Hope in Essex wanted a good service, not discounts on
overcrowded, unreliable trains.
The line from London to Shoeburyness via Southend has been given the lowest
targets to meet under the passenger's charter - targets it met last year.
As the 16:40 rattled through south Essex, commuters were reading leaflets
about the charter. Few seemed impressed, although one said: 'At least
they're trying to do something.'
Miss Maria Wickenden, a telecommunications supervisor from Stanford-le-Hope,
was lucky enough to get a seat. She said the line's reputation for
timekeeping was so bad that some employers will not hire people who commute
on it.
Yesterday morning had been typical - the 7.01 to London was cancelled and
the next train was late. She arrived in London at 8.50 - 20 minutes late.
The cancellation cost her Pounds 5.30 because she could not use her weekly
discount ticket.
Mr Terry Tubby, a self-employed roofer from Aveley, Essex, said: 'The
charter has been set up to help them, not us. It's easier than sorting out
the real problems that ordinary working people face every day. They don't
know what it's like, those nobs in their chauffeur-driven cars.
'At the moment the service is not too bad. The only problem is there are no
seats. There's nothing in the charter about that.'
The 16.40 pulled in to Stanford-le-Hope on time.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Managers win battle for control of BTG
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANAGEMENT of Brit-ish Technology Group, the state-owned technology
transfer organisation, yesterday won the battle for control of the group
after privatisation.
Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, said the government was 'to
enter a period of exclusive negotiation for BTG with a consortium led by
management and employees'. The negotiations are expected to take only days.
The management triumphed over a group led by Mr John Ashworth, director of
the London School of Economics and supported by a US technology transfer
company, Research Corporation Technologies.
The Anglo-American group is understood to have bid more than Pounds 50m  -
at the top end of the range of expectations.
The successful management-led team is believed to have bid Pounds 23m plus
further payments depending on royalty income over the next decade. The total
paid will almost certainly be substantially less than Pounds 50m.
Mr Lilley said that 'the terms of (BTG management's) bid maximise the
proceeds consistent with the best prospect of the continuation of BTG's
existing technology transfer activities'.
The winning consortium includes CIN Venture Managers, part of the British
Coal Pension Fund, as well as merchant banks and academic institutions from
the UK and other European countries.
The remaining negotiations concern the relative involvement of these groups.
The sale has taken four months and was conducted on the basis of sealed bids
amid criticism that BTG would have to release commercially sensitive
information to its US rival.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Labour may continue with full fleet of Trident subs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLEAR hint that a Labour government might consider going ahead, after all,
with a full fleet of four Trident nuclear missile submarines was given
yesterday as the first of the vessels was ceremonially rolled out of its
construction hall.
The 16,000-ton Vanguard submarine was built at VSEL's shipyard in
Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.
Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow foreign secretary, said Labour's decision on the
fourth submarine would be based on whether it would cost more to cancel it
or to complete construction. Speaking on BBC radio he said that only as a
government would Labour have access to confidential analyses on the number
of submarines required.
'Until we are persuaded that a fourth Trident is needed we will operate on
the basis of not having a fourth Trident, unless cancellation costs are
greater than completion costs,' said Mr Kaufman.
He added that the party had so far seen 'no convincing clear defence
argument' that a fourth submarine was needed. He accused the government of
having 'absolutely no idea' what it wanted to do with the Trident force.
The contract for the fourth submarine is still under negotiation and is not
expected to be placed before the general election. But the vessel is already
a quarter built, with more than Pounds 140m already spent on it.
VSEL yesterday challenged estimates that Pounds 450m would be saved by
cancelling the submarine, putting the potential savings at less than Pounds
250m.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Tractor makers told to halt information exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission yes-terday ordered several leading tractor makers to
stop sharing sensitive information on sales in the UK, alleging this
collusion had helped the companies solidify a share of about 88 per cent of
the British market.
Four big tractor companies - Ford New Holland, John Deere, Massey Ferguson
and Case International - and four with smaller operations in the UK - Fiat
Agri, Renault, Lamborghini and Deutz of Germany - have been sharing business
information since 1975 through a computer network.
Some manufacturers last night acknowledged that information on the
registration of vehicles was being exchanged through a third party, but
denied that the information swap involved pricing details.
Renault, the French state-owned vehicle producer, said it regretted the
Brussels move. It added that information had only been exchanged to help
identify the scale and nature of a difficult market.
The commission has ordered manufacturers to scrap the system or scale it
down so it does not interfere with free competition. It decided not to
impose a fine as it judged that the information-sharing did not amount to a
fully-fledged cartel.
Brussels said the tractor makers were effectively eliminating competition.
'You can't exchange company-specific figures,' said the commission, adding
that these 'should be secrets which help companies compete, even to lead
each other up the garden path'.
Members of the information exchange would also be in a position to act to
exclude outsiders, the commission feared.
The commission's move followed a long inquiry, and took account of the fact
that the UK tractor market is declining, relatively small, and highly
concentrated.
Since the inquiry started, Ford New Holland has merged with Fiat Agri.
In certain types of tractors sold in the UK there were only three or four
suppliers, and no significant imports from outside the EC.
The commission said the oligopolistic structure of this market contrasted
with that of the UK car market, where prices were generally above those on
the Continent, but which was subject to considerable pressure from Japanese
imports. Yesterday's decision carried no implications for the UK car market,
the commission said.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Further lead case on swaps is settled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER lead case in the long-running litigation over interest-rate swap
agreements has been settled out of court, Raymond Hughes writes.
Samuel Montagu, the investment arm of Midland Bank, yesterday settled with
Welwyn Hatfield District Council in Hertfordshire, from which it was
claiming Pounds 1.26m under two swap deals. Welwyn has also settled its
third-party claims for Pounds 181,538 and Pounds 1.06m from the London
boroughs of Hackney and Islington respectively. The terms were not
disclosed.
It is the third of the six lead cases to be resolved without a trial. Last
month Samuel Montagu settled with Birmingham City Council, while Barclays
Bank and its investment banking subsidiary Barclays de Zoete Wedd reached
agreement with the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham - both on
undisclosed terms.
A lead action in which Citicorp Investment Bank is claiming Pounds 521,323
from Sandwell Borough Council, West Midlands, is due for trial on Monday. In
third-party proceedings Sandwell is claiming Pounds 269,246 from the London
Borough of Hackney, while Hackney has a claim for interest against the
London Borough of Brent.
The remaining lead cases of Chemical Bank and National Bank of North
Carolina v Hammersmith and Fulham are scheduled for after Easter.
The lead cases were selected because they covered the majority of legal
points that arose after the Lords' ruling last year that interest-rate swap
agreements between banks and local authorities were invalid.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Late arrival at rail charter ball: BR's delayed compensation
system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO CHEERS were all the Central Transport Consultative Committee, the
statutory rail users' watchdog, could muster for the passenger's charter
unveiled yesterday. Even that modest praise was all but drowned by criticism
from other quarters.
On a positive note, the charter is believed to be the first attempt by any
railway in the world to introduce a systemised compensation scheme for
season-ticket holders.
But in spite of attempts to keep the charter simple, the arrangements are
complex, potentially confusing and riddled with loopholes. They will in many
cases give passengers the same or worse compensation than they receive under
BR's existing arrangements.
The long delay in producing the charter - originally due last autumn - is
indicative of the difficulties which the government and BR have met in
trying to live up to the expectations of the Citizen's Charter.
At root was the problem of cost. Without government funding, BR could not
afford to be more generous with compensation unless it put up fares or cut
investment - in both cases this would hit the people it was trying to help.
Even so, BR has budgeted for an increase in the compensation fund from
Pounds 7m a year to Pounds 10m-Pounds 15m, but the right to automatic
refunds and the extension of benefits to commuters means the money will have
to be spread among a far higher number of potential claimants.
The result is that many are likely to find themselves worse off than they
were before. Under the old system, BR could afford to be generous with
compensation because so few people knew it was prepared to give any.
The biggest strain on resources will come from Network SouthEast commuters.
These have been among the worst victims of poor performance because they
have lacked the evidence to support their claims of persistently bad
timekeeping.
Now Network SouthEast will not only keep the records for them but put up
posters declaring the results and invite claims if certain performance
targets are not met.
The targets will be dif-ferent for each of Network SouthEast's main routes.
Recently modernised routes such as the Great Northern will be expected to
run 99 per cent of scheduled rush-hour trains and get 90 per cent of them to
their destinations within five minutes of the scheduled time.
If they fall short on punctuality by more than 1 percentage point or
reliability by more than 3 percentage points, they will offer a 5 per cent
discount on season-ticket renewals. If they fail on both, the discount will
be 10 per cent.
One loophole is that the worst performing lines will have much softer
targets. The unmodernised London, Tilbury and Southend line, for example,
will be required to run only 97 per cent of trains and deliver only 80 per
cent within five minutes of the scheduled time.
The Consumers' Association said: 'Performance standards as low as 80 per
cent reveal the truly abysmal expectations BR has of its service. It's like
admitting that one-in-five passengers is guaranteed to step off a train
angry and late.'
BR's defence is that fare increases will be lower on the unmodernised lines.
Further, it denies that the targets are too soft - four Network SouthEast
lines would have failed on the basis of last year's performance, it says.
Asimilar scheme will be introduced for commuters elsewhere on the system.
InterCity and Regional Railways will be expected to run 99 per cent of
trains and get 90 per cent to their destinations within 10 minutes of the
scheduled time (five minutes for short routes). If performance falls short
on a route its commuters will get discounts on the same basis as on Network
SouthEast.
Compensation for people making one-off journeys has become, if anything,
less generous. Travel vouchers will become the normal form of recompense,
cash refunds being offered only in exceptional circumstances.
Delays of an hour or more will earn a voucher for 20 per cent of the ticket
price paid - a claim for anything more than this will require special
pleading.
However, claims for delays of anything less than one hour, say 50 minutes,
will be automatically disqualified unless a special case can be made.
Commuter services operated by local authorities in all the metropolitan
areas outside London are excluded from the compensation arrangements
although it is hoped that they may be brought into the scheme later.
Some measures are likely to achieve widespread support. Rail staff in
contact with the public will be required to wear name badges; performance
figures will be monitored by an independent auditor; and trains with buffet

FT  05 MAR 92 / IoD reports continued fall in business optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS optimism among company bosses fell in the first two months of this
year, the Institute of Directors said yesterday.
A survey of 322 directors from all sectors of business showed that last
month only 43 per cent were more optimistic about their company's prospects
than they were six months ago, compared with 48 per cent in December and 56
per cent in October. Those who were less optimistic rose from 12 per cent in
October to 24 per cent last month. Economic optimism also declined, but by
less than between October and December.
Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the IoD, said: 'Confidence peaked last
October, the month after the last interest rate reduction, and has been
declining ever since.'
Mr Morgan said the Budget might boost business but he did not expect to see
any significant change in expectations until uncertainty was removed by the
general election.
Insufficient demand emerged as the main worry among directors, with 43 per
cent rating it above cashflow problems. The 28 per cent reporting an upturn
in orders reversed a rising trend, from the 38 per cent in December.
Optimism varied throughout the three regions into which the IoD divides the
country. The north - which includes Scotland - registered much greater
optimism about company prospects than the Midlands - which includes Wales -
or the south, which covers the south-east, the south-west and East Anglia.
The Midlands was the only region where optimism about the economy rose
between December and February. Those saying they were more optimistic rose
from 35 per cent to 37 per cent compared with a fall from 40 per cent to 33
per cent in the north and from 36 per cent to 30 per cent in the south.
Investment levels fell from an upturn in October to levels recorded through
most of last year. In February 45 per cent of directors reported their
companies to be investing, against 44 per cent in December and 56 per cent
in October.
Labour's proposed minimum wage would raise unemployment by at least 150,000
and add more than Pounds 2.5bn a year to employment costs, the Confederation
of British Industry said yesterday.
The CBI said Labour's plans threatened to destroy a number of industries
which are already struggling in the recession. There was particular concern
about textiles, clothing footwear, tourism and agriculture.
The economy is about to pick up, according to a survey of business opinion
by the Institute of Purchasing and Supply, a trade body which represents
industrial buyers. Its index of economic trends, stood at 50.8 last month,
compared with 47.2 in January.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Lloyd's reveals proportion of working Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S has issued figures which outline the proportion of working and
external Names on all the syndicates in the insurance market and the
aggregate values of those participating for each of the past six years.
Lloyd's is to make the data - covering 1986-91 - available to all Names.
In a recent letter addressed to Sir William Clark MP, Mr David Coleridge,
Lloyd's chairman, explained the decision by saying the information 'should
not be available on a selective basis'.
Sir William is a member of the independent four-man committee which is to
investigate alleged malpractices at the insurance market under the direction
of Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board.
Table 1 lists nine syndicates, expected to be shown to have been among the
worst performers in 1989 when full results for that year are reported in
June. All the syndicates have a below average proportion of working Names.
In the Lloyd's market as a whole approximately 12 per cent of Names are
categorised as working members.
This suggests insiders may have steered clear of these hard-hit syndicates.
Table 2 lists the 10 syndicates which provided Names with the best returns
after expenses in 1988, the last year for which results have been reported.
It shows that working Names were substantially over-represented on these
syndicates - accounting on average for more than 18 per cent of syndicate
members.
Each of the six most attractive syndicates is of below-average size,
however, with one (number 952) capitalised at less than Pounds 500,000,
compared with a market average of about Pounds 27m.
Table 3 lists the 10 syndicates with the highest propor
While seven of them produced positive returns for their members, the table
suggests that a high proportion of working Names is no guarantee of
profitability. Syndicate 764, with more than 41 per cent of working Names,
registered particularly heavy losses.

FT  05 MAR 92 / An inspector should call a lot more often
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT WEEK will be one of the toughest in the short life of Imro. The
parliamentary committee investigating pension reform is expected to target
Imro and the City system of self-regulation for their failure to prevent the
pillage of the Maxwell pension funds.
Imro's job is to protect people whose money is being managed by professional
advisers. Yet last year Mr Robert Maxwell siphoned away more than Pounds
400m from his companies' pension funds while they were managed by Imro
members. More than 30,000 employees and pensioners now face uncertainty and
perhaps poverty.
In a hard-hitting report, due to be published on Monday, the social security
select committee is expected to criticise Imro fiercely both for the
standards of its initial vetting of members and for its subsequent
supervision.
Imro is one of several self-regulatory organisations created by the
Financial Services Act 1986 (FSA). It was authorised to start operating in
April 1988 by the Securities and Investment Board and most of its present
1,250 members were admitted in the first wave of applications.
In Imro's own view its vetting of members is rigorous. It scans the
applicant's 'business record and reputation', the 'honesty and integrity of
its directors' and its financial resources. Imro's statement to the select
committee calls the application a 'substantial hurdle' for prospective
investment managers.
It is a hurdle few have failed to leap, however. Imro has refused membership
to fewer than a dozen applicants.
Among those it authorised in 1988 were two companies controlled by Mr Robert
Maxwell, Bishopsgate Investment Management (BIM) and London &amp; Bishopsgate
International Investment Management (LBI). BIM, which was wound up in the
High Court yesterday, was the route through which much of the pension money
vanished.
Other public company assets were diverted through LBI on their way to
private Maxwell companies.
In the view of some MPs on the committee there were two reasons why Imro
should have exercised particular care: Mr Maxwell's business reputation, and
his intention that BIM and LBI would manage the pension money for companies
also controlled by Mr Maxwell.
By 1990 BIM ran 80 per cent of the Pounds 700m central pool of pension money
for most of the UK-based Maxwell companies and LBI was one of the managers
for the balance.
Imro told the committee that 'a feeling of unease' does not justify it in
refusing membership. 'The law is concerned to ensure that entrance into the
market . . . cannot be stifled by dislike.'
It said that in the Maxwell case it had concluded that 'neither (Mr Robert
Maxwell's) business reputation nor the 1971 Department of Trade and Industry
inspectors' report (which judged Mr Maxwell unfit to run a public company)
represented sustainable grounds for refusal.'
Although that is scrupulously impartial, if Imro is to let in members about
whom it feels uneasy then its subsequent supervision needs to be vigilant.
Yet in Imro's own words, once an applicant is deemed to be 'fit and proper',
Imro's supervisory system 'has to necessarily assume that . . . by and large
. . . the relevant law will be respected.'
Imro's statement to the select committee says that it applied its normal
supervision to the Maxwell fund managers - but that no system is proof
against fraud.
Its visits to LBI and BIM and the regular returns which they submitted threw
up a series of administrative irregularities, but none that caused Imro
'great concern' and it received rapid written assurance that they had been
corrected.
Looking at Imro's account, there are several areas of weakness, however.
The first is the infrequency of its visits. Imro made one formal assessment
of each Maxwell fund manager, LBI in February 1989 and BIM in November 1990.
If it had repeated the visits at any point last year it might have detected
the abuse. It now appears that Mr Maxwell stripped pension funds of their
money in just 10 months between February last year and his death.
Imro says that it has tried to visit members every two years and that it has
seen each member at least once in its four year life. Mr John Morgan, Imro's
chief executive, accepts that Imro has had a 'protracted development phase',
taking longer to set up its administration than it expected.
In defending its slow start, Imro points out that it was the only SRO not to
be based on a previously existing body, and had no experience of the
investment houses for which it suddenly became responsible.
A second question is whether the meetings between Imro and LBI directors
last year on the subject of stocklending should have caused Imro more
disquiet. LBI was the manager of First Tokyo Investment Trust, a trust
tracking the Japanese stock market. LBI regularly lent out the trust's
investments to LBI's parent London &amp; Bishopsgate Holdings, and Robert
Maxwell Group, Mr Maxwell's main private holding company.
Stocklending is a legal and common practice to increase a fund's income.
However, it is normally carried out through specialised brokers with outside
investment houses and traders.
Stocklending proved to be the most important mechanism by which Mr Maxwell
was able to transfer pension-fund investments out of the care of investment
managers and into his private companies.
Imro reports that during March and April last year LBI's compliance officer
inquired about Imro's rules on stocklending and met with Imro staff, who
discerned no problems.
In May last year LBI took over First Tokyo and the offer document said that
the stocklending might have jeopardised First Tokyo's status as an
investment trust. This led Imro to investigate in July and August whether
First Tokyo shareholders had been damaged by the stocklending - an inquiry
which was out of its normal routine of supervision. It again found its
inquiries satisfied.
The First Tokyo case is crucial partly because of the timing - Mr Maxwell's
theft of funds was well under way by the middle of last year. But it also
gave Imro a reason to look closely at a member whose chairman had a
troublesome reputation and wide-ranging power.
The case points to a wider issue: Imro's reluctance to do more than make
'running repairs'. If Imro had added the Maxwell fund managers' record of
small irregularities to its initial grounds for uneasiness about their
chairman, First Tokyo might then have prompted it to probe more deeply.
To help prevent future Maxwells, Imro will have to be prepared to be more
intrusive in its inquiries - and to probe some members more deeply than
others, because it has more cause to be uneasy.
In Imro's view it has become more vigorous in the past year. It fined six
members for administrative irregularities last year, and following a change
in its rules in November began to publish their names. The most recent fines
 -between Pounds 75,000 and Pounds 100,000 - have been heavier than in the
past. According to Mr Morgan visits may now become more frequent.
But it will need to persuade its members that it is not simply trying to
cover embarrassment over Maxwell with a flurry of activity. If it
successfully makes the necessary transformation it will need to accumulate a
long record of success to compensate for its failure to spot the theft of
pension funds in one of the biggest business frauds of this century.
'Imro will take steps to strengthen its supervision'
'What went wrong was the confusion - the imposition of very heavy duties on
trustees of pension schemes by the Financial Services Act'
'It seems to me that (a pensions act) is inescapable. It's a bit
simple-minded to argue that a few good ideas will solve anything.'
'The trustees (of the Maxwell company schemes) either persuaded themselves
or were persuaded that they had no obligation to oversee the investment
activities'
'The future role of Imro in any new scheme is to continue to govern the
investment management of portfolios'
John Morgan Imro chief executive

FT  05 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Patten confirms Polly Peck donation
 -Party Finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, ANDREW JACK and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative party yesterday confirmed it had received donations
totalling Pounds 440,000 from companies within the collapsed Polly Peck
empire of Mr Asil Nadir which had not been disclosed in the company
accounts.
The party indicated that it did not intend to return the money.
Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, would not comment on what action
he might take, saying it was a hypothetical question on a matter that would
be going before the courts.
The donations were not disclosed in Polly Peck International's accounts
covering the period 1985-1990, possibly in breach of company law.
Mr Patten appeared to confirm that the money had already been spent, saying
that 'since it was donated either side of the 1987 election, it would be
surprising to discover it was still under the mattress'.
He emphasised that the Conservatives 'had acted entirely in good faith
throughout', and had answered all questions put by the administrator.
The revelation sparked calls from Labour MPs for a Commons statement by Mr
Patten. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, wrote to the Serious Fraud
Office pressing again for an inquiry into Polly Peck's contributions to the
Conservative party.
An early day motion tabled by Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, accused
the Tories of being 'in receipt of stolen cash'. It called on Mr Major 'to
arrange for the return to Touche Ross, the administrators of Polly Peck, the
Pounds 440,000 of contributions made to his party by Asil Nadir, the
chairman of the company, without disclosure in the company accounts'.
The 1985 Companies Act requires that the directors' report contains details
of donations to political causes over Pounds 200. There are no such entries
in the accounts of PPI for periods between 1985 and 1990, although Touche
Ross unearthed evidence of such payments soon after one of its partners was
appointed as joint administrator.
It said the partner, Mr Christopher Morris, who has special responsibility
for discovering any creditors' claims, had been advised there was no way he
could request repayment of the money.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories try to calm nerves over
election - Public Opinion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT managers tried to steady party nerves yesterday as senior
ministers damped rumours sweeping Westminster that Mr John Major could
announce the election as early as today.
Senior party figures commented disparagingly on an NOP poll which is said to
show a 5 point Labour lead in about 50 marginal seats.
The survey is said to show Labour on 43 per cent with the Conservatives on
38 per cent, and the Liberal Democrats on 18 per cent.
Calming speculation about an election announcement today, ministers said a
statement on next week's parliamentary business, dominated by Budget
arrangements, would go ahead as planned.
One reason for the rumours could have been Mr Major's visit to Buckingham
Palace last night to attend the presentation of the Queen's Awards for
Industry, on top of his customary audience with the Queen on Tuesday.
Tory managers put the best face they could on the NOP poll, emphasising the
difference between a poll based on small samples in 50 seats and one
involving larger numbers across more sampling points.
They insisted that the Tories had better party organisation in the
marginals, and that the 'incumbency' factor would favour sitting Tory MPs.
NOP would not comment on the findings, but said that the interviews, with 20
people in each seat, were carried out last Wednesday. The survey was
commissioned by the Local Government Chronicle and the television programme
Public Eye.
At Westminster, the Tories turned the campaign back to Labour's effect on
the economy, as Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, presented City
forecasts predicting higher public sector borrowing and inflation and lower
growth under Labour.
The message will be driven home in a party political broadcast tonight using
the slogan that Labour would mean the double blow of 'more taxes and higher
prices'.
Labour responded that the Tories had not included the most recent estimates
indicating better employment and growth and lower inflation at the end of a
first-term Labour government compared with a further Conservative term.
The Local Government Bill, which introduces the new council tax, cleared its
final Commons stage last night and is due to receive Royal Assent tomorrow.
Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, told the House that
regulations closing the legal loophole preventing computer evidence being
used to establish non-payment of poll would be introduced as soon as the
bill became law.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Political Notebook: Fratricide born of monetary confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE two quite separate political debates about the case for fiscal
prudence or otherwise in next week's Budget.
The first is the obvious one which will continue to dominate the election
battle between the Conservatives and Labour. But a more fascinating - and
equally vociferous - argument has started on the right of the Conservative
party. It looks likely to run well beyond the general election - win or
lose.
Guardians of the Thatcherite torch have taken to expressing themselves as
unenthusiastic as Mr Neil Kinnock for a cut of a penny or two in the basic
rate of income tax at the expense of another few billion on public
borrowing. This has raised eyebrows among those brought up to believe that
Mrs Margaret Thatcher was more determined than most to give voters the
chance to spend more of their own money.
More seriously, it has infuriated nervous ministers who see an old-fashioned
bribe as the best and perhaps only chance of winning an April 9 election.
The first signs of a row surfaced in some unguarded remarks by Mr Cecil
Parkinson. The former cabinet minister is now chairman of Conservative Way
Forward, a pressure group set up to defend the free-market wisdom of the
1980s. He argued that the government's reputation for economic prudence,
albeit slightly frayed, was far more important to the voters than a
pre-election cut in income tax. With borrowing at well above Pounds 20bn Mr
Norman Lamont should err on the side of caution.
His comments provided the cue for a stream of less temperate attacks on Mr
John Major from Thatcherite acolytes, most notably Professor Patrick Minford
of Liverpool University and Professor Sir Alan Walters, her former economic
adviser.
What has given such voices resonance at Westminster is the perception that
they articulate Mrs Thatcher's own thoughts - offered privately at
gatherings of her supporters in the No Turning Back group.
The former prime minister has said she intends to keep her counsel during
the campaign - she does not want to become the scapegoat for a Labour
victory. Privately, she has scarcely disguised her horror at the prospective
borrowing requirement.
Her starting point is that governments cannot borrow their way out of
recessions. She recalls the 1981 Budget - when Sir Geoffrey Howe raised
taxes at the same point in the economic cycle in defiance of 364 Keynsian
economists - as proof positive.
From there the argument becomes more complicated. Mr Madsen Pirie, the
director of the free-market Adam Smith Institute, is among a number of
erstwhile true believers who have broken ranks to press the case for tax
cuts.
Ironically, Conservative Way Forward has itself published a pamphlet in
which two election candidates reach the same conclusion.
The result is confusion. At least one No Turning Back member (whose own view
is that the political imperative of tax cuts long ago rendered academic the
theoretical arguments) has taken to describing his soulmates as 'all over
the place'.
The apparent contradictions can be reconciled. Mrs Thatcher and her allies
have not suddenly decided that taxes are a good thing. Quite the reverse.
She is as strong as ever in her defence of the individual against the state.
Instead, the debate about the Budget is a proxy for two much more
fundamental rows over economic management.
One centres on Mr Major's decision to add Pounds 11bn to public spending in
the autumn. The other is that familiar bete noire of the right, the exchange
rate mechanism.
For those who have kept faith with 'sound money', Mr Major committed two
mortal sins. The first was to subordinate interest rate cuts to maintaining
sterling's rate in the exchange rate mechanism. The second was to seek to
compensate for that by relaxing the public-spending purse strings.
The successful monetarism of the 1980s, the argument runs, has been replaced
by the failed Keynsianism of the 1960s and 1970s. It is a theme that Mrs
Thatcher is likely to return to when she takes up her seat in the House of
Lords after the election.

FT  05 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour would use full PSBR increase
 -Alternative Budget Proposals

THE FULL amount of any increase in public sector borrowing through next
week's Budget would be allocated to the economic programme of an incoming
Labour government, the party said yesterday.
The decision, confirmed in a pre-Budget briefing by Mr John Smith, could
mean a substantial cash boost to the party's own public spending plans,
possibly raising available resources by as much as Pounds 4bn.
The shadow chancellor claimed the depth of the recession and the need for
investment meant 'it is necessary and desirable to increase government
borrowing.'
But he went on to add: 'It must be borrowing for the right purpose.
Borrowing to build a stronger economy and lasting wealth for our country and
for the generations that follow us.'
Unlike a Tory 'tax bribe', Labour would use the money for investment to
build the productive capacity that 'provides the means to pay off our debt'
and to balance the budget in the longer term.
Party officials have been careful, however, not to rule out the option of
using some of the extra borrowing to modify their own tax and spending
plans, due to be announced a week after next Tuesday's Budget, when a
general election is widely expected to be under way.
By promising to take up the full PSBR rise, Labour would be implicitly
accepting the government's view on what constitutes a prudent rise.
But campaign strategists believe that the Opposition will still be able to
level the 'imprudence' charge by making the distinction between PSBR rises
to promote investment-led growth and a windfall Tory tax cut for voters.
If the City and the markets judged the Tory PSBR proposals as reasonable,
then they could not consider them unacceptable from Labour, one party
official said.
Under Labour's plans as currently published, about Pounds 4.4bn in new
spending on recovery measures and increased pensions and child benefit would
be entirely met by tax rises and the removal of the upper earnings limit on
national insurance contributions (NICs).
Comparing the government's autumn economic projections with new figures from
independent forecasters, Mr Smith said it was 'very clear' that a Labour
government would take office in quite different economic circumstances than
first expected.
That comment may provoke some to conclude that Labour is preparing to modify
its plans to raise top tax rates and to phase in its proposal on NICs.
Mr Smith would not be drawn on the detail of his 'shadow Budget', scheduled
to be presented on March 17 as a significant component in Labour's election
campaign. It is clear that the document will be a comprehensive budget
statement, possibly almost as fulsome as that tabled by the government a
week earlier.
The shadow chancellor agreed, however, that there was scope and 'a strong
case' for an immediate  1/2 percentage point cut in interest rates.
