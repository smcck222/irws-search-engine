FT  03 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farmers recite litany of
problems - Drought and politics fail to discourage South African managers /
Farmer's Viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST Thursday afternoon I went to a prayer meeting in a field. The
congregation consisted of between two and three hundred black workers from
the adjacent citrus farm and a dozen or so white South African managers. The
Pastor was also white and spoke with a distinctive Glasgwegian accent.
The service began with the singing of a hymn by a small choir of boiler
suited black labourers, both men and women. The tune was familiar enough but
the rhythm, the harmony and the clapping could only have been African.
There followed impassioned prayers by the Pastor and others who felt so
moved, for the rain which was so desperately needed for their crops.
Indeed, there had been similar prayer meetings on the farm on the previous
three Thursday afternoons but still those prayers had not been answered.
The so-called rainy season had yielded only about one third of the 1000 or
so millimeters expected in this part of the Transvaal and in the meantime
daytime temperatures had soared to more than 40 degrees centigrade.
The workers, some of whom were newly independent black farmers operating
through a co-operative structure, were facing seriously reduced yields and
quality of the fruit they had grown, largely for export to places like the
UK, and the reservoirs used for irrigation water were almost empty. So they
had paused in their work to seek Divine intervention.
The previous day, I had been 150 miles further south at a cattle auction on
a farm near the town of Ermelo. It was an annual sale of breeding stock of
the Drakensberger breed developed from indigenous cattle to withstand
drought and to thrive on the low quality grazing of the 5000 foot altitudes
of the High Veldt. The animals have the black colouring and many of the
characteristics of the Aberdeen Angus.
On the way to the farm I had seen crops of maize decimated by the drought.
Normally, at this time in the South African late summer, crops of maize
should be seven feet tall and be carrying at least a couple of cobs apiece.
This year, however, most were barely three feet high and the leaves were
brown and scorched. Few plants had any cobs at all.
It was no surprise, therefore, to find that few buyers had turned up at the
auction. They had no feed either and the trade was bound to be depressed.
In the event, prices for the quality animals, bred by one of South Africa's
top breeders, were down about 30 per cent on those achieved at the same sale
last year and the vendor was relieved to be rid of them. He too was
desperately short of feed because of drought and the previous week another
breeder had been forced to call off an auction at which there were no bids.
Lack of rain is only one of the current preoccupations of South African
farmers. Another is the March 17 referendum on continued reform towards
majority rule: still another is the depressed state of the South African
economy and last but certainly not least is the performance of their team in
the World Cup cricket tournament in New Zealand.
Paradoxically, all of these factors seem to have combined to create a
generally optimistic mood in spite of the problems both present and
potential.
I have so far only travelled through the predominantly English speaking
Natal, and the Transvaal but I have yet to meet or hear of a farmer, or
anyone else for that matter, who does not support the De Klerk line on
reform.
Afrikaans speaking areas may well think differently, but I have not yet been
to them.
Reasons for supporting the President's policies are really quite simple,
according to those I have met. They see it as inevitable. They readily
concede that apartheid has not worked and that it has cut them off from the
rest of the world. They blame the present depression in their economy on the
withdrawal of investment from South Africa by the US and others and they see
reform as the only way to attract it back and to reduce inflation and
interest rates.
Some farmers I have spoken to claim to be paying up to 28 per cent on
borrowed money. They reckon they could survive the drought well enough
without such a punitive overhead.
The combination of the two problems at the same time, however, will, they
fear, cause several of their neighbours and friends to go bust. For the
record, I have not been able to find anyone who thinks it will happen to
him; it is always the fellow down the road.
There remains the question of what will happen to the abundant supply of
cheap black labour come majority rule. Will black men and women still be
prepared to work on farms for the equivalent of Pounds 25 per month plus the
provision of main meals and very basic housing for their families? Indeed,
will some future government of South Africa allow the present structures to
continue? The farmers I have met are confident that they will still be in
place as owners and employers for many years to come. They are convinced,
they say, that a black government will recognise that it cannot do without
their organisational expertise and will make it possible for them to
continue much as before.
Furthermore, they believe that they have treated their black workers so well
in the past that they will be loyal in the future, whatever that brings.
In the meantime, however, many of the farms I have visited feature
multi-wire, six feet electric fences surrounding the farm house for
protection against marauders.
It is always explained that this is because of the mounting violence and
theft by urban based blacks and that the rural workers are one big happy
family whose children have grown up with their own. Clearly, however, they
are hoping for the best while preparing for the worst.
Meanwhile, back at the cattle auction, the auctioneer interrupted the
bidding to announce that South Africa had just beaten Australia in the World
Cup. For the rest of the sale, euphoria reigned and I would swear that
prices improved slightly.
In a sports mad country like South Africa, the mere fact of being allowed
back into world competition could well be significant in influencing the way
people vote on March 17.

FT  03 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Dutch market shows top
February gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DUTCH government bonds outperformed other government bond markets last
month, helped by better-than-expected inflation figures and the prospect of
lower levels of issuance during the rest of the year, writes Sara Webb.
JP Morgan's government bond figures for February show Dutch state bonds
gaining 1.4 per cent in local currency terms, with the 10-year yield spread
over German government bonds narrowing by over 10 basis points.
The Dutch Treasury completed about one-third of its annual borrowing needs
in January, so worries about future levels of supply have diminished.
Hopes of a cut in interest rates boosted UK government bond prices, which
gained 1.38 per cent in February and 4.04 per cent since the start of the
year, making gilts the top-performing bonds so far this year.
Japan was the worst-performing bond market last month, gaining only 0.21 per
cent in yen terms and falling 2.58 per cent in US dollar terms.
Australia was the top-performing bond market last month in US dollar terms.
The market was helped by a slight strengthening of the Australian dollar
against the US currency due to budget uncertainty.
Australian bonds gained 1.16 per cent, although since the start of the year
they have fallen by 2.98 per cent.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall sharply on rise in US
business index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MUCH bigger-than-expected rise in the National Association of Purchasing
Management's index of business activity sent Treasury prices plunging
yesterday across the maturity range.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1 1/4 at 101
3/32 , yielding 7.897 per cent. The two-year note was also markedly weaker,
down  11/32 at 99 7/8 , yielding 5.426 per cent. The price movements
flattened the yield curve, narrowing the spread between the yields on the
two-year note and 30-year bond from 255 basis points to 247 basis points.
Prices held their own at the opening, but nose-dived after the NAPM
announced that its February index had risen from 47.4 per cent to 52.4 per
cent, an indication that the manufacturing sector of industry expanded last
month.
The rise in the index was way above market forecasts, which even at the most
bullish end had expected that the figure would remain below 50 per cent, and
prompted many dealers to start liquidating long positions built up during
last week's short-lived rally.
The big rise in the index deflated hopes for another interest rate cut, and
backed up arguments by Federal Reserve officials that the economic recovery
was underway.
UK government bond prices fell by as much as a quarter of a percentage point
yesterday as hopes of an imminent cut in the base rate began to fade.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt fell from 116 1/2 to 116 9/32 , while the
Liffe gilt futures contract moved in a range of 97.31 to 98.08, trading at
98.03 by late afternoon, down from the opening of 98.07.
The market expects the Bank of England to announce further gilt issues this
week now that its Pounds 1.25bn tap is exhausted, with short-dated issues
the favourite candidates.
German government bonds drifted lower yesterday in thin trade, following the
US market's weakness. Traders said the low volumes are due to the Carnival
holiday, but added that in the absence of significant economic data, the
market is waiting for progress in the wage negotiations.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.26 and traded in a range of
88.12 to 88.28 on a volume of about 27,000 contracts which is well below the
daily average.
Japanese government bonds ended the day lower on light volumes as
participants wait for signs of an easing in monetary policy.
Traders said that in the short-term attention would focus on the Bank of
Japan's quarterly 'Tankan' survey of business sentiment and on the US
employment figures - due to be released on Friday.
The Tankan is expected to show that economic growth is slowing down.
However, dealers believe that the Bank of Japan is unlikely to cut the
official discount rate until next week at the earliest as the central bank
governor, Mr Yasushi Mieno, will be out of the country from March 5 to March
11. Meanwhile, dealers expect government debt to trade in a narrow range.
The benchmark No 129 issue opened with a yield of 5.365 per cent and ended
at 5.395 per cent on a volume of about Y230bn, well below average.

FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Intel continues legal battle
against chip companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEL, the leading US semiconductor manufacturer, is continuing its
aggressive legal assault against imitators of its microprocessor chips.
The company has filed patent infringement suits against Chips &amp;
Technologies, another Silicon Valley semiconductor company which sells
semiconductor devices to personal computer manufacturers.
Last summer, Chips &amp; Technologies announced plans to sell a family of chips
based on its version of the 386 microprocessor, Intel's top-selling product.
Intel alleges Chips &amp; Technologies 386 and a related 387 co-processor chip
violated Intel patents.
Chips, which does not have its own manufacturing plant, sub-contracts
production of these devices to Texas Instruments, one of the largest US
chip-makers. Chips and Texas are also reported to be in talks about a
possible licensing agreement related to the microprocessor devices.
However, Intel's suit, filed on Friday, attempts to block any such agreement
between Chips &amp; Technologies and third parties. Intel is seeking a temporary
restraining order to prevent transfer of the microprocessor technology. It
also asked for an injunction to prevent sale of the semiconductor devices
and for unspecified damages in connection with the alleged patent
violations.
Chips &amp; Technologies rejected Intel's allegations. 'Intel's lawsuit is a
continuation of its policy to exert a monopoly over the microcomputer
industry,' said Mr Gordon Campbell, president and chief executive of Chips &amp;
Technologies.
Intel is also involved in intellectual property disputes with Advanced Micro
Devices and other US chip-makers. Mr Campbell alleged the Intel suit was 'an
attempt to delay the adoption of our superior microprocessors by the
computer industry.'
'Because of our belief that Intel would misuse the legal process, Chips took
extraordinary precautions in designing our microprocessor and co-processor
products,' Mr Campbell said. He claimed all Chips' products were designed
from scratch and Chips' microprocessors and co-processors substantially
outperform the equivalent Intel microprocessors.
'We will take whatever actions are necessary to strongly defend our
intellectual property and our right to conduct business,' Mr Campbell said.
Intel and Chips &amp; Technologies are holding talks which began before Chips'
introduction of its 386 microprocessor.
'During the course of these discussions both companies had agreed to
standstill agreements. On Friday, Intel abruptly and without warning, filed
this lawsuit and requested a temporary restraining order,' said Mr Campbell.

FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Child World freezes credit
payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHILD WORLD, which claims to be the second largest discount toy retailer in
the US, revealed yesterday that it has stopped paying trade creditors and
landlords of its 125 stores.
The troubled company said payments were being 'delayed,' although a
spokesman declined to say when they might restart.
Child World, based in Massachusetts, made the delayed payments public in
conjunction with an announcement that it was 'entering discussion on new
sources of equity financing'. It maintained the object of holding up
creditor payment was to 'ensure that day-to-day operations continue to run
smoothly'.
The retailer added that its banks had entered 'an amendment and limited
waiver' in relation to an existing credit facility, which constrict the
facility to the amount outstanding for the next fortnight, in order to give
time for the discussions to take place.
Child World's financial problems last came to head in late-1990 when
payments to creditors were also temporarily halted. However, in June 1991,
the retailer's former owner - CNC Holding - sold its 82 per cent interest in
the struggling company to an investor group led by two former executives of
Toys 'R' Us, the largest retailer in the field.
Under the deal, toy manufacturers were to receive sums over a number of
years. This schedule had begun and was continuing until the current freeze
of trade creditors payments became operative.
Speculation that Child World, which operates stores under the Child World
and Children Palace names, might be unable to make payments circulated last
December, but a payment was made mid-month.

<TEXT>
TRAVELERS Corporation, the large US insurer, has said that it is still
looking at ways of improving its capital position.
The company has been hit by property-related losses, and has already cut
dividends to preserve capital.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Travelers said the
strategies might include offerings of securities to one or more investors;
divestitures and investments in Travelers or certain of its subsidiaries.
Travelers, however, said this process had been going on since 1989 and there
was no guarantee that such actions would go ahead.
Assets have already been sold - including Dillon Read, the investment
banking business, last November. For 1991 Travelers unveiled improved
results, with the group posting a Dollars 318m net profit compared with a
Dollars 178m loss in 1990.

FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Equitable surplus shrinks
further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITABLE Life Assurance Society, the third largest US insurer, yesterday
revealed it saw its surplus shrink by another Dollars 290m in 1991 - ahead
of the Dollars 250m 'surplus note' capital injection which Axa, the French
insurer provided in early summer.
The 'surplus' is essentially the policyholders' cushion, and changes from
year to year are the best measure of a mutual company's profits or losses.
After adding in the Dollars 250m surplus note injection and the mandatory
securities valuation reserve, Equitable's statutory capital stood at Dollars
1.65bn at the end of 1991, compared with Dollars 1.69bn in 1990.
Equitable is currently a mutual insurer - that is, one which essentially
belongs to its policyholders. It is in the process of converting to
shareholder-owned status, and Axa is expected to acquire a very large
minority stake at that stage, in return for a total Dollars 1bn investment
made last July.
Equitable said yesterday it would 'soon' be mailing the hefty documentation
on this to more than 2m eligible policyholders entitled to vote on the
matter. The documents have been awaited for several days, now and two-thirds
of those voting must be in favour.
The figures produced by Equitable for 1991 are particularly complex because
of the demutualisation scheme. Instead of just providing 'statutory'
numbers, filed with the insurance authorities, Equitable is also disclosing
how its figures would look of a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles) basis. GAAP accounting, which is more conservative, is used by
all publicly-held US corporations.
Under GAAP, Equitable shows a Dollars 898.1m loss, with Dollars 307.8m
coming from continuing operation, Dollars 561.9m from discontinued
operations and a Dollars 28.4m charge for demutualisation costs. The loss
for discontinued operations refer to the guaranteed investment contracts, an
expensive form of contract, where Equitable has now written off its losses.
The write-off was taken in one year under GAAP, but spread under the
statutory system.
A Dollars 370m write-up of the Alliance Capital subsidiary was also
disallowed under GAAP.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEXICAN government has sold nearly 82 per cent of the equity in Banco
Mexicano Somex, the country's sixth largest bank, for Dollars 846m,
equivalent to 29 times last year's earnings, and a record 4.63 times book
value.
A group of investors headed by Mr Eduardo Creel, the former Inverlat broker,
and Mr Vicente Aristegui, the former Chrysler Mexico chief, paid Dollars
3.42 a share for a controlling 51 per cent at 5.2 book value.
The group has the option to buy a further 30.62 per cent of Series B stock
at a lower price, which would bring total revenues from the privatisation to
Dollars 846m.
Somex has assets of Dollars 5.38bn, and had profits last year of Dollars
36m. It has 329 branches across Mexico, less than half the number operated
by Banamex, Mexico's largest bank. The bank has had difficulties with poor
loans and a high proportion of subsidised (and often non-performing)
mortgage loans.
The second and third bids for Somex were at 4.15 and 3.73 book value
respectively, greater or equal to the winning bids for the four largest
banks already sold.
*****
ARGENTINA began yet another foray into the world equities market yesterday
when the government kicked-off an international marketing campaign to sell
its 30 per cent stake in Telecom Argentina, one of the country's two
privatised telephone companies, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires.
The sales offensive began in Paris and will end in San Francisco on March
14, a few days before the offer closes. The government has set a minimum
price of Dollars 640m for the shares, but they are expected to fetch Dollars
800 to Dollars 900m.
Telecom was created in November 1990 when the national telephone network was
privatised and split in two. Telecom, which operates in northern Argentina,
is managed by the French and Italian state telephone companies.
The flotation is expected to repeat last December's successful sale of the
government's 30 per cent stake in Telefonica de Argentina, which runs the
phones in southern Argentina. It raised Dollars 850m for the government, due
largely to strong demand in Argentina.
Telecom reported net profit of Dollars 52.3m on sales of Dollars 862.4m in
1991.

MR YA'ACOV Nimrodi, the Israeli businessman who last week bought the daily
newspaper Ma'ariv from the administrator of Mr Robert Maxwell's Israeli
assets, has sold on half his holding in a deal which gives a rival publisher
a large stake in the company, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem.
Mr Nimrodi sold a 22 per cent stake in Ma'ariv Modi'in, publisher of
Ma'ariv, for Dollars 3m to the Schocken family, which publishes the rival
Ha'aretz and Hadashot daily papers.
Another 22 per cent stake in Ma'ariv was sold by Mr Nimrodi to Mr Jack
Lieberman, an Australian with investments in Israel, and a local partner.

FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Safren lifts net profit and
payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPROVED cash management, a lower tax bill and a solid performance from
hotel and leisure subsidiary Kersaf helped Safren, the South African
diversified shipping, travel and leisure group, to lift net profit for the
six months to December by 11 per cent, writes Philip Gawith.
Turnover rose by 9.3 per cent to R2.3bn and operating profit by 6.4 per cent
to R337.8m (Dollars 119m). A lower tax charge, however, boosted attributable
earnings by 11.1 per cent to R133.3m. Earnings per share rose to 248.3 cents
from 224.5 cents, and the dividend was lifted to 65 cents a share from 60
cents.
Safren recorded a R63m extraordinary loss against a R30.3m profit a year
earlier. This was the result of a R78.5m write-off on a 49 per cent stake in
Compagnie Maritime Belge Transport (CMBT) taken by shipping arm Safmarine
last year. Earnings after extraordinary items thus dropped to R70.3m from
R150.3m.
Mr Buddy Hawton, chief executive, said the group knew at the time of
purchase that CMBT was making substantial losses which would take three to
four years to correct. Staff cuts and the closure and disposal of
unprofitable operations had given rise to 'material additional costs of a
non-recurrent nature'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RELIANCE Industries, the Indian textile and petrochemicals group controlled
by Mr Dhirubhai Ambani, and Reliance Petrochemicals (RPL), its associate,
have merged, creating the largest private sector corporation in India.
The merger, which took effect from March 1, is intended to give Reliance
more leverage to raise funds from the capital markets and to create a group
to rank in the world's top 500 companies.
In deciding to merge the two companies, the Ambani family which controls
both, have taken advantage of the recent lifting of controls that put limits
on the size of Indian companies - and hence their ability to compete
internationally.
Under agreed merger terms, 10 RPL shares are to be exchanged for one
Reliance Industries share. Reliance Industries holds 21 per cent of RPL.
Reliance Industries reported Rs20.9bn (Dollars 798m) sales last year and
Rs1.2bn of pre-tax profits. RPL, a new company established as greenfield
downstream petrochemicals company, is to report sales and profit figures for
the first time this year.
Kleinwort Benson estimates that consolidated sales of Reliance could leap to
Rs42bn in financial 1993 and pre-tax profits climb to Rs4.7bn (Dollars 179m)
as major new investments come onstream.
In combining the two companies, Reliance believes it will be in a stronger
position to raise further funds from the capital markets. RPL's
petrochemical complex at Hazira is costing Rs15bn - almost double original
estimates. Reliance says a gas cracker due to be completed at Hazira will
cost Rs12bn - though outside estimates put it much higher.

<TEXT>
DIGITAL Equipment is offering early retirement to about 7,000 of its US
employees, or over 10 per cent of the computer company's US workforce, in
its latest effort to reduce costs and 'downsize the corporation'.
Digital has been struggling to reduce employment for two years in the face
of flat sales and depressed profitability. The company employs about 119,500
people worldwide, including 60,300 full-time workers in the US.
The early retirement programme, the first of its kind offered by Digital,
applies to all US employees over the age of 50, with five years or more
service with the company, and is voluntary.
A spokeswoman said that the voluntary programme was in addition to existing
Digital severance programmes.
Since September 1989, when the job reduction programmes were initiated,
about 12,450 people have left the company, excluding normal attrition and
retirements.
All but 5,550 of these job cuts were mandatory.
For its second fiscal quarter, ending in December, Digital reported net
losses of Dollars 138m on revenues of Dollars 3.5bn.
Digital has taken a total of Dollars 1.6bn in restructuring charges over the
past two years to cover the cost of plant closings, consolidations and work
force reductions.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has cleared the Agnelli family's agreed bid for
Exor, which controls Perrier, the French mineral water producer, but only on
condition that the Agnellis limit their influence over the mineral water
strategy of BSN, the French food group which has launched a counter-bid for
Exor.
Yesterday's announcement was the first indication of Brussels' attitude in
the complex battle for Perrier. The Agnelli/Exor deal was cleared mainly
because Ifint, the Agnelli bid vehicle, no longer owns any mineral water
brands.
The Commission would not comment on its response to any of the other bids
and counter-bids in the sector. But it seems likely that other pending
mergers - notably Nestle's bid for Perrier, which the Commission is already
looking at, and the BSN/Exor deal, which has not yet been notified to
Brussels - will pose more problems than Agnelli/Exor because both bidder and
prey hold strong positions in the lucrative mineral water market.
If any of the bids prompts 'serious doubts' about its effect on the EC
market, the Commission will mount a full inquiry, and could, if necessary,
block the merger or impose conditions.
Although the Agnellis have no direct involvement in the sector, the
Commission was concerned about the indirect effect of the family's 5.8 per
cent stake in BSN, which owns the Badoit mineral water brand, and the
influence of Mr Umberto Agnelli, who has a seat on the BSN board.
From now on, Mr Agnelli - brother of Mr Gianni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat -
will be unable to take part in discussions and decisions on BSN's mineral
water strategy. Nor will the Agnellis be allowed to exchange information
with BSN which might 'influence competitive behaviour' in the mineral water
sector.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, yesterday reminded the
Agnellis that the Commission had the option of opening a separate inquiry if
the Italian family won control of Perrier and strengthened its links with
BSN.
That seems unlikely at the moment, since BSN - which wants to acquire the
Volvic mineral water brand from Perrier - is now allied with Nestle, in the
opposite camp from the Agnellis, and has forbidden the Italians from
increasing their stake.
Commission officials said yesterday that although Brussels' merger task
force was keeping an eye on the whole Perrier situation, each bid would be
considered separately, assuming it was large enough to trigger an automatic
inquiry in Brussels.
Meanwhile, the Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs, a body that regulates the
French stock market, yesterday gave the go-ahead to the counter-bid for
Perrier unveiled last week by a group of investors led by Exor.
The Exor group, which already controls nearly 49 per cent of Perrier, made
its offer for the rest of the shares to comply with a CBV ruling. It is
offering FFr1,475 a share for the remaining stock, the same as that offered
by Nestle.
The CBV also decided to allow Perrier and Exor's shares to resume trading on
the Paris stock market tomorrow.

FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Steinhardt in Dollars 587m bid
for Integrated Resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STEINHARDT Managers, the New York-based investment company, yesterday
announced that it had made a Dollars 587m cash bid for Integrated Resources,
the troubled financial services company in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
The Steinhardt bid matches a similar offer for Integrated from the Pritzker
family of Chicago, whose holdings include the Hyatt Hotel chain.
The new offer comes a few weeks after Bankers Trust, the US banking group,
pulled out of a deal to acquire Integrated for Dollars 565m, reported to be
because negotiators could not agree on the terms of the liabilities the bank
would have assumed under the takeover.
Steinhardt said its bid was submitted on behalf of the company and
'affiliated entities' last week.
It would not comment on the details of the offer, but said it expected its
proposal to be subject to significant negotiations and modifications.
Any acquisition of Integrated would have to be approved by the bankruptcy
court and creditors as part of a reorganisation plan that brings the company
out of Chapter 11.
Integrated, which specialised in syndicating property tax shelter
partnerships, went bankrupt in February 1990 with liabilities of at least
Dollars 1.5bn.
Since then, the company has been talking with a number of potential bidders
while attempting to formulate a reorganisation plan.
Steinhardt Partners is an investment and fund management firm run by the New
York money manager Mr Michael Steinhardt.
The company was in the news last year after it was discovered that
Steinhardt was one of the customers which, along with securities house
Salomon Brothers, acquired more than 90 per cent of a May 1991 auction of
government securities.
Government authorities are investigating whether there was any collusion
between Salomon and its customers to corner the market in the May issue.
Some market participants claimed they lost millions of dollars because of
Salomon's dominance of the two-year note issue, and their complaints
eventually led to the discovery of illegal bidding by Salomon's bond trading
desk in previous auctions.
The investigation, however, has so far uncovered no evidence of such
collusion, and Steinhardt Partners has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

1.27m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Harrington Kilbride, the magazine group which came to the main market in
December, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.27m in 1991.
This was in line with the prediction of not less than Pounds 1.25m given by
Mr Kevin Harrington, founder and managing director, in the prospectus.
The rise from Pounds 1.01m was achieved on turnover up 50 per cent to Pounds
9.19m (Pounds 6.11m).
Among the company's titles are Baby, Royal Dempster's and several business
journals.
Earnings emerged at 10.2p (8.1p) per share and, as was explained in the
prospectus, there will be no dividend, though a payment at the interim stage
of the current year is envisaged.

Alphameric, a loss-making computer equipment company, has secured its
survival by raising Pounds 4.3m through a placing and open offer.
Directors warned recently that without the cash injection the group would be
unlikely to be able to continue trading. Over 50 per cent of the shares
offered were issued to existing shareholders with the balance going to new
institutional and private shareholders.
Alphameric, which specialises in custom keyboards, electronic point of sale
and satellite data broadcast systems, said it had a healthy forward order
book with contracts from Alcatel and Groupe Bull of France, ICL, IBM,
Microvitec, Linwood and Reuters.
In the first six months of the current year the company incurred a loss of
Pounds 377,000.

Turnover rose to Pounds 6.93m (Pounds 6.67m) and pre-tax profit reached
Pounds 630,000, against Pounds 616,000.
Order intake for the opening two months of 1992 was encouraging. If that
trend was maintained full year results would show further improvement, and
would confirm the group was continuing to obtain a greater share of an
exceptionally competitive market.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Doeflex, the maker of specialist plastic materials, overcame its difficult
first quarter to produce an increase of 13 per cent in operating profit over
1991.
However, pre-tax profit declined 3 per cent, from Pounds 1.28m to Pounds
1.24m, reflecting additional interest costs associated with the purchase of
the freehold of the Swindon factory.
Turnover improved marginally to Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 18.1m). The group was
not immune to the depressed conditions in the construction and DIY markets,
but significant growth was coming from products introduced over the past two
years.
Earnings per share worked through at 10.59p (10.21p) and the final dividend
is 2.7p for an unchanged total of 4.02p.
Gearing at the year-end was 118 per cent but a favourable cash flow was
expected this year.

<TEXT>
J Billam, the specialist engineering group, lifted pre-tax profit from
Pounds 117,000 to Pounds 306,000 in 1991. Turnover, however, showed a 15 per
cent reduction.
That reflected the considerable time spent on reducing head office overheads
and tightening control over costs and working capital. Gearing was cut from
70 per cent to 47 per cent.
Turnover came to Pounds 5.85m (Pounds 6.9m), producing an operating profit
of Pounds 508,000 (Pounds 432,000), which was boosted by a cut in interest
charges to Pounds 95,000 (Pounds 139,000) and a reduction in the exceptional
charge to Pounds 107,000 (Pounds 176,000).
Earnings per share trebled to 13.3p (4.2p). The final dividend is 2.64p to
make 4.28p (4.04p).

Unidare, the Irish maker of welding consumables and equipment, conductor
cables and wire products, maintained its profit in 1991 with the help of
exceptional credits.
Pre-tax profit came to IPounds 5.09m, or Pounds 4.72m, compared with Pounds
5.07m previously. There were IPounds 231,000 credits, being surplus on sale
of land less rationalisation costs.
Turnover rose to IPounds 101.4m (IPounds 99.7m) with the UK accounting for
two thirds. The wire division suffered a significant setback; the welding
side was hit by the slump in demand for capital equipment but buoyancy in
construction of offshore oil production platforms and in pipe fabrication
underpinned the performance of the division.
Unidare Environmental, involved in electric space heating products, swung
from losses to a small profit.
Earnings per share were 28.33p (26.23p). The final dividend is 10.9p for a
total of 15p (14.2p).

DALEPAK FOODS said yesterday that it was in preliminary discussions to sell
part, or all, of the company.
The announcement was prompted by a 71p increase to 433p in the company's
share price.
Stockbrokers de Zoete &amp; Bevan have approached a number of possible buyers
following the decision by Mr Jonathan Ropner, Dalepak chairman, to sell his
20 per cent shareholding. .The five other executive directors own just under
30 per cent of the group.
The sale is likely to make multi-millionaires out of the directors as the
group is valued at about Pounds 50m.
Although de Zoete &amp; Bevan stressed that the talks were at a 'very, very
preliminary stage', the group is expected to be sold to one buyer.
Dalepak made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.02m for the year to end-April and
analysts are forecasting continued profits growth over the next two years.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 40m missing from AGB pension fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT Pounds 40m is missing from the AGB Pension Scheme. This was confirmed
by Clay &amp; Partners, the pension fund trustee which is winding up four
private Maxwell pension funds.
Mr Alan Fishman of Clay said that the fund for the employees and management
of AGB Research, the market research company, would have access to about
Pounds 20m in assets. There should have been more than Pounds 60m.
About Pounds 8m is in the form of assets managed by two external investment
managers, Invesco MIM and Legal &amp; General and is seen as secure and readily
available. An estimated Pounds 12m is held in the Maxwell Common Investment
Fund managed by Bishopsgate Investment Management, but may not be available
for months or even years.
Mr Fishman believed it would take Pounds 16m to meet the entitlements of the
AGB fund pensioners, Pounds 23m for remaining members and a further Pounds
14m for bulk transfers covering groups of people who have moved because of
restructuring or sale of a division.
If pensioners had first priority they would be likely to get their payments
in full but the benefits of those still working would be cut substantially.
If the courts decided that the bulk transfer payments should be made ahead
of pensioners the position would be very different.
'In this case, current pensions will have to be cut back and the remaining
members will receive no benefits,' Mr Fishman warned yesterday in a letter
to fund members.
The detailed breakdown of likely assets of the private pension funds comes
in the wake of last week's announcement from Robson Rhodes, provisional
liquidator to Bishopsgate Investment Management, that Pounds 237m had been
recovered out of the Pounds 695m sought.
Mr Fishman found that the circumstances of the individual private Maxwell
funds varied.
About Pounds 2.3m has been recovered of the Pounds 3.2m assets of the
Maxwell Media Pension Plan. This means that current pensions are likely to
be met in full although the benefits of remaining members will be
significantly cut.
The Headington Pension Plan, however, has a holding of about Pounds 1.8m,
instead of the Pounds 11m. In this case there is not enough money to cover
payments to pensioners, unless other assets are recovered.
Mr Kevin Maxwell is to be forced to answer questions from the receiver of
Adviser (188), the family company which began the collapse of the Maxwell
empire when it defaulted in December last year on a Pounds 56m loan from the
Swiss Bank Corporation.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Curious similarity leads GrandMet to
Dollars 500m suit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT'S THE difference between a 'Curious Kid' and a 'Burger King Kid'? Far
more than a hamburger may rest on the answer.
Grand Metropolitan, the food and drink group which owns the US-based Burger
King chain, has become the target of a US lawsuit which claims that the
cartoon characters used to promote the Burger King Kids Club were copied
from an earlier cartoon called 'The Curious Kids'.
The plaintiff is CK Company, a general partnership linked to a small New
York-based company called Gould &amp; Reichman and which holds the copyright to
the Curious Kids characters.
The damages claimed are anything but modest. CK is asking for Dollars 500m
(Pounds 286m).
The nub of the CK case is that the Burger King Kids have mimicked many of
the Curious Kids features.
One character in both strips is in a wheelchair; one is an Afro-American
boy; there are three Caucasian boys in each, and two Caucasian girls.
The Curious Kids have a dog called Morty, the Burger King Kids one called
Woofer. Both 'gangs' play musical instruments, and have one boy and one girl
vocalist - Kid Vid and Boomer in the case of Burger King, or David and
Tracey for the Curious Kids.
CK brought similar allegations to Burger King's attention in July 1991, when
they were investigated. GrandMet has not seen the suit, but believes it is
without merit.
The lawsuit says the Curious Kids were devised 'to teach elementary science
concepts and reading skills and focus on social issues.' The Burger King
Kids Club is used as a marketing tool.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Deal simplifies ADT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL ASHCROFT, the controversial head of ADT which yesterday sold its
indirectly held 49 per cent stake in Cope Allman Packaging, might be
forgiven for crowing.
The sale places a Pounds 117m price tag on the stake which many analysts
have found extremely difficult to value. Not only does it reduce ADT's debt,
more importantly, it clarifies parts of ADT's often complicated
relationships with affiliate companies which have created misunderstanding
and suspicion among shareholders, and markets in general.
Yesterday's 37p rise in the share price to 500p reflects the value of the
deal to ADT.
It is possibly the first good news ADT has had to announce after last year's
public fight with its largest shareholder, Laidlaw, and a grim period of
watching the falling values of investments in companies like Lep and
Christies.
ADT is not receiving the Pounds 117m in cash immediately. At completion
Bowater will pay Pounds 58m in cash with a further Pounds 9m over three
years. In addition Bowater will give ADT a Pounds 50m transferable and
interest bearing loan note.
After the cash, this aspect of the deal is the most valuable to ADT. Instead
of holding Pounds 102m in loan notes of uncertain value from Quoteplan, the
subsidiary which owned Cope Allman, it now has marketable Bowater paper.
ADT sold its 49 per cent stake in Quoteplan to Sechura, its Canadian
affiliate, in 1990 for CDollars 90m, (Pounds 43m), financed by loan notes
from ADT.
At the last interim stage, ADT wrote down the value of its Sechura loan
notes. As a result it is understood ADT will have to make only a small
write-down on these notes. Sechura, where Mr Ashcroft and his wife now have
a 29 per cent stake, will then be an empty shell with no assets and no
liabilities.
The end of ADT's Sechura chapter should go some way to clearing up what had
become something of a hallmark of the Ashcroft way of management - the
shuffling of assets between ADT affiliates and related companies which pass
the auditors' scrutiny but leave shareholders and the City somewhat
suspicious.
In the 1990 accounts, for example, ADT did not take a 49 per cent share of
Quoteplan's Pounds 10.3m net attributable loss into its own profit and loss
account. Instead it took a profit on the sale of Quoteplan to Sechura.
The sale also profitably ends Mr Ashcroft's involvement with Quoteplan which
started with a failed bid in 1983 and led to a leveraged buy-out in 1988 at
a time when debt financing was readily available.
Had Quoteplan been floated at some future date - the intention was to float
last December but market conditions were not propitious - ADT might have
shared a slice of a larger pie.
But few shareholders worried about ADT's debt would begrudge Mr Ashcroft
acceptance of Bowater's offer. Had he not, ADT would still now be the
largest creditor to a debt-laden business, neither a fashionable position to
be in these days nor consistent with Mr Ashcroft's new strategy of reducing
gearing.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Director quits top post at Ashley Group
</HEADLINE>

   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Ashley Group, the window blind distributor and food retailer in
Spain, jumped 8p to 50p yesterday following the resignation of Mr Anthony
Butler, the chief executive.
Mr Butler resigned following disagreements over group strategy. Ashley has
been under pressure from some institutional shareholders to make changes
since it released a profits warning in October, leading to a fall in the
share price from about 100p to 32p last month.
Yesterday's steep rise was also due to bid speculation concerning Ashley's
break-up value. But Mr Chris Tipper, finance director, said: 'We've had no
form of notification of any stake building in the company and we have not
seen any evidence.'
Mr Butler's successor has not been named and Mr James White, chairman, said
the senior management structure of the group was now under review. The
company is also concentrating on trying to improve its supermarkets business
in Spain, Mr White said.
Mr Butler built up Ashley through acquisition after joining in 1988 from Dee
Corporation, which later changed its name to Gateway.
Ashley moved into food retailing in Spain with the acquisitions of Digsa in
1988 and Dismo in 1990. Ashley also built up its window blind network with
acquisitions in the UK, Germany, France and the Netherlands.
But after rapid growth in the late 1980s, Ashley's pre-tax profits for the
year to end-August were flat at Pounds 13.7m.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Asda set to appoint Lazards as adviser
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Asda, the Leeds-based grocery chain, is likely to see a further
strengthening of its board this week as Mr Archie Norman, the
recently-installed chief executive, continues to construct a new management
team around him.
The company also seems set to appoint Lazards as its new financial advisers.
Asda confirmed yesterday that Warburgs had been removed as financial
advisers partly as a result of its involvement in advising Asda's arch
rivals, J Sainsbury and Isosceles (which runs the Gateway chain).
The move follows a close review of Asda's relations with all its
professional advisers.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Brooke says Ulster talks may start soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS and Northern Ireland's main political leaders yesterday said
round-table talks could start soon but were unable to set a firm date.
The outcome of talks between Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary,
and the party leaders in Belfast undermined hopes that anything other than a
symbolic first meeting could start before the election.
Mr Brooke expressed optimism that talks could start 'as soon as possible'.
However, in spite of the optimism created by the unexpected deal between
Unionist and nationalist leaders late last week on resuming talks, it
appears significant details have still to be worked out.
Mr Brooke will meet Irish ministers on Friday when he will set out the
Northern Ireland parties' positions and test whether any fresh conditions
they may have proposed for talks are acceptable to the Dublin government.
The local leaders also want written assurances from Mr John Major and Mr
Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, that talks will continue on the same basis
whatever the general election result.
A starting date of next Monday for talks seems improbable. The talks, which
collapsed in July, are unlikely to restart in earnest until after the
election, which is expected to be called by the end of next week.
Meanwhile, Northern Ireland clergymen who met Loyalist paramilitary leaders
last month said they would be prepared to meet representatives of Sinn Fein,
the IRA's political wing, in the interests of peace.
Separately, Cardinal Cahal Daly, the Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland,
said on BBC Radio that he would not be surprised if individual priests were
meeting the IRA 'because of the tremendous desire for peace there is in all
sections of the community.' However, he stressed that the church would not
act as political intermediaries.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Chatlines could be forced out of business by Oftel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE controversial telephone chatline industry faces the threat of being
driven out of business by Oftel, the telecommunications regulatory body.
Oftel said yesterday it intended to revoke a code of practice under which
the chatlines operate on April 6. The effect would be to stop BT and Mercury
Communications from providing the chatline-service companies with
telecommunications facilities, bringing the industry to a halt.
Chatlines, which allow individuals who ring premium-rate phone numbers to
talk to other people who ring that number at the same time, have been
criticised on the grounds that they encourage big phone bills.
The services are charged at 48p a minute and there have been persistent
reports of customers used to small bills being presented with demands for
hundreds of pounds after their children have abused the service. There have
also been cases of burglars phoning the lines from their victims' houses.
Oftel's move has been triggered because a fund designed to compensate
customers who face high bills as a result of unauthorised use of their
phones has run up a Pounds 600,000 deficit.
The Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone
Information Services, which regulates chatlines and runs the compensation
fund, said it had asked 12 chatline companies to clear the deficit about a
month ago, but only two had paid.
The committee said it was not clear why the others were not paying.
Oftel said it was no longer satisfied that the code of practice made
'adequate provision for compensating those who suffer as a result of the
provision of chatline services'.
BT, however, has agreed to pay compensation to any of its customers who have
outstanding claims which would have been paid by the fund if it had had
enough money.
Oftel expects the chatline companies to challenge its action in court by
trying to get an injunction. The Independent Chatline Association, which
represents the industry, had no comment to make yesterday.
Chatlines have been controversial since their introduction about five years
ago. BT was forced to abandon its own service following a public outcry. The
current regime of a code of practice and a compensation fund followed an
investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE PEOPLE died in ethnic violence in Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday after
Serb gunmen opposed to independence for the Yugoslav republic disrupted the
capital, Sarajevo, with barricades.
The violence heightened fears of a civil war in the republic, which managed
to stay on the sidelines during the recent bloody conflict between Serbs and
Croats in breakaway Croatia.
With tension high, Bosnian authorities persuaded Serb militants to pull down
at least some barricades last night, but gunfire rang out in the streets as
agreement was being announced.
The makeshift barricades of buses and lorries sprang up just hours after the
close of voting in a referendum on independence for the republic of Serbs,
Croats and Muslims.
Provisional results showed more than 90 per cent voted for independence,
though with only a 60 per cent turnout. The Serbs, a third of the
population, boycotted the referendum.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's Serbs and a close ally of Mr
Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, said on television: 'We are not
going to accept an independent Bosnia-Hercegovina.'
Tanjug news agency said one person was killed and two others wounded when an
evening peace march by 1,000 young anti-Serb demonstrators carrying candles
was fired on from a barricade. A hospital doctor said four people were shot
dead earlier in the day.
As some barricades came down, it was unclear whether a blockade of the city
was being lifted entirely.
Earlier, on the outskirts of the city, a masked gunman at the barricades
said Serbs had sealed off the city to 'punish the murderers' of a Serbian
man, killed at a wedding party on Sunday.
Serbs make up 31 per cent of the 4.3m population of Bosnia. Moslems comprise
44 per cent and Croats, 17 per cent.
'Serbs, Moslems and Croats lived here in peace for years. We never thought
that this could happen,' said Mr Samir Dzubic, a newspaper vendor, and the
son of a Serbian father and Moslem mother. 'Everything is now being
destroyed.'
The European Community, which said it would accept the outcome of the poll
provided half the electorate voted, condemned the violence.
The EC recognised the independence of the two former Yugoslav republics of
Slovenia and Croatia on January 15. It made recognition of Bosnia
conditional on a republic-wide referendum.
Mr Karadzic, in Belgrade for talks with the Serbian-dominated rump
presidency of Yugoslavia, said 'if the conflict develops into a civil war,
then the Irish problem would look like a seaside holiday.'
The presidency wants Bosnia to remain part of a smaller Yugoslavia - without
Slovenia and Croatia.
Moslems and Croats want to live in an independent Bosnia. However,
nationalist Croats want to be part of a greater Croatia, and nationalist
Serbs want to join with neighbouring Serbia. If Bosnia was formally split
between both republics, it would leave the Slavic-speaking Sunni Moslems
without a home.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Coal contract talks near agreement: Deal may safeguard pits
but pressure is on to keep electricity prices low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL and the electricity generators are close to resolving the
deadlock over crucial contracts which will decide the future size of the UK
coal industry.
Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, the privatised generator, said
yesterday the negotiations were 'very constructive and moving forward'. He
added: 'We look forward to an early conclusion. There may even be an
agreement before the election.'
Mr Neil Clarke, chairman of British Coal, agreed that a deal before the
general election should not be ruled out. It could cover several years, make
possible cheaper electricity, and ensure the future of British Coal. The two
companies are understood to have had a meeting yesterday.
PowerGen and National Power, the other privatised generator, are easily
British Coal's biggest customers. But it is understood that National Power
is further from agreeing terms with British Coal.
The new contracts, which will replace existing three-year contracts on March
31 next year, have become a political issue in advance of the proposed
privatisation of British Coal.
The two sides have found it hard to agree a price and the generators have
threatened to cut the 65m tonnes a year they buy from British Coal, in
favour of cheaper imported coal.
Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, is under pressure to find a
compromise between a secure future for British Coal and low electricity
prices for consumers.
He has tried to smooth the negotiations by holding discussions with the
regional electricity companies. But both generators deny he has discussed
the contract directly with them.
Mr Clarke said yesterday he was 'mystified and angered' by claims that
British Coal was planning to close all but a dozen profitable pits in
preparation for its privatisation.
Mr Clarke indicated that the price in the new contract might be higher than
the 150p per gigajoule, the unit of energy from coal, which has been
suggested and closer to British Coal's present costs of 163p-164p.
He said British Coal's costs could fall significantly between now and the
start of the new contract, allowing the company to drop its price over a
period of years.
The contract was likely to be structured in two stages, he said, to give
British Coal time to adjust.
National Power has indicated it would like a price of around 130p per
gigajoule, and has pointed out that the Scottish electricity industry
recently imported 8,000 tonnes of coal at 100p per gigajoule. The political
pressure to restrain electricity prices is already intense. Prices to
industrial consumers are set to rise by between 15 and 20 per cent and in
some cases more.
Mr Clarke yesterday warned of the serious threat to miners' jobs by the
expansion of gas-fired power generation.
He said that by the mid-1990s gas-fired generating capacity would be
equivalent to 21m tonnes of coal, putting at risk some 21,000 miners' jobs.
And towards the end of the decade, gas-fired capacity could be twice that
figure, Mr Clarke told a meeting of the Coal Industry Society in London.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been many months since the UK market saw three flotations and the
same number of management buy-outs announced on the same day, let alone a
rights issue and double acquisition as well as a healthy clutch of less
valuable deals. But the notion that old times have returned for London's
work-starved corporate financiers should be treated with caution. Although
yesterday stood out, it was in stark contrast to the recent dearth of
deal-making. Most companies are delaying investment decisions ahead of the
election. That is contributing to the stubborn slowness of recovery, which
in turn is compounding political doubts. And with the two main parties
running neck and neck in the polls, the election may not resolve this
uncertainty.

There seems no stopping the share price of Banque Bruxelles Lambert. Up by
more than a quarter since bid gossip began in early December, the bank's
paper was again in demand yesterday despite a firm denial of takeover
interest from International Nederlanden Group. ING's statement, to be fair,
does not rule out further purchases to add to its 9 per cent stake, but
speculators are playing a dangerous game. While the assumption is that
Groupe Bruxelles Lambert's Mr Albert Frere holds the ring with effective
control over a 32 per cent stake in BBL, a lot depends on the still unknown
intentions of his powerful allies at the French insurance group UAP.
Creeping control by one side or the other still looks more likely than an
all out fight.

FT  03 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street's calm reaction to yesterday's much-improved manufacturing
purchasing managers index for January is the latest reminder that US equity
prices are discounting plenty of economic recovery. After January's
unexpectedly strong rise in construction spending, the market appears to
have concluded that it will take either a nasty set of employment figures
later this week, or poor retail sales for February, to restore the
possibility of a further interest rate cut.
In the meantime, evidence of recovery is gradually coming from a broader
range of sources. The central issue now is the extent of the revival from
what looked like the beginnings of a dip last November - not least because a
robust rise in the economy could yet be evident in time to tip the political
scales in George Bush's favour. The employment component of yesterday's
purchasing managers index shows that jobs were still being shed last month,
albeit at a slower rate. Fear of unemployment remains the dominant sentiment
among consumers. While that is the case, the US economy is poorly positioned
for a sustained recovery, if only because the unwillingness to spend - also
confirmed in yesterday's figures - will be hard to shift. But perhaps that
matters less than the fact that recovery is visible at all.

FT  03 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Bowater
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something of a fin de siecle feel about two highly leveraged
packaging businesses simultaneously returning to the big company fold. Add
in the names of Mr Michael Ashcroft and Mr Roland Franklin and the effect
for some will be pure 1980s nostalgia.
Turning to the more serious matter of making money in the 1990s, Bowater's
purchase of DRG Packaging and Cope Allman Packaging makes good strategic
sense. Between them the acquired companies increase their parent's presence
in the profitable niche markets of healthcare and pharmaceuticals packaging,
while providing a substantial platform for expansion in continental Europe.
DRG and Cope, in turn, will have access to Bowater's financial resources and
should thus be able to make good the years of capital expenditure neglect.
While cash strapped buy outs generally leave little scope for further
working capital reductions, it would be surprising if Bowater does not get
to work quickly on margins. And thanks to the way the deal is structured,
there should be no earnings dilution in the first year. Yet there is little
room for the shares to disappoint. They have outperformed the market by two
thirds over the last two years, but more to the point are trading on a 16
per cent premium to the market's prospective multiple for 1993 on the most
optimistic forecasts for profit.

FT  03 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Taking Wellcome on trust
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,554.3 (-7.8)
It would be difficult for any investor to resist the temptation to take
profits on a holding that has risen nearly sevenfold since flotation in
1986, and more than doubled in the last year alone. While most might have
chosen merely to top-slice, however, the Wellcome Trust never really had the
option of anything but a blockbuster sale if it was to avoid creating an
overhang of Wellcome shares. So it is difficult to read any real lessons
from the size of the deal for Wellcome shares in particular or for the
pharmaceutical sector in general.
That said, the trust could hardly admit to doubts about whether the
company's growth prospects were enough to justify a multiple of 36 and a
yield of 1.3 per cent. Such doubts are real, though, even if in the short
run they may not matter too much. There will be technical factors
underpinning the shares despite the loss of scarcity value which took 5 per
cent off their value yesterday. UK institutions will doubtless want to
correct their underweighting in Wellcome.
Demand should also be high from overseas investors, particularly those in
the US who have hitherto been deterred by the lack of liquidity in the
stock. Since Wellcome generates less than 10 per cent of its sales in the
UK, the offering should be relatively well absorbed, whatever the investment
climate that follows the election.
Yet the difficulty remains that of picking the moment when exponential
growth has simply run its course. Wellcome's forecast yesterday of a 30 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits for the first half of its current financial
year indicates it is still able to provide the growth that its price
requires. How much longer that will hold is largely a matter of faith. The
trust will be sitting on a tidy profit, whatever happens.

FT  03 MAR 92 / All the ingredients for a long shelf life: Can Wal-Mart,
America's discount retail group, sustain its explosive growth?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 8.30 on a cold winter's morning in Dover, Delaware, employees of a new
114,000 sq ft Wal-Mart store are whooping and hollering. 'Give me a W,'
shouts a store manager, leading the pre-opening ceremony. 'W,' yells the
throng of shop assistants. 'Give me an A,' . . . and so on.
Outside, the locals press against the glass and debate what effect the
arrival of America's most successful discount retailer will have on their
town. 'Tough on Ames,' mutters one lady, referring to a rival general
merchandise retailer which has already filed for bankruptcy. Sure enough,
100 yards down the road, Ames has sparsely stocked shelves and only four
customers.
Already an aggressive store expansion programme has taken Wal-Mart's sales
from Dollars 2.44bn in 1982 to almost Dollars 44bn last year - making it the
world's largest retailer in turnover terms. Last week it reported a 24.6 per
cent increase in profits in 1991 over 1990 to Dollars 1.6bn. Now Wal-Mart,
which sells goods from detergents to golf clubs, is muscling into food
retailing and experimenting with own-label. It is also engaging in a row
with trade representatives, and offering suppliers a direct computer link to
individual stores to cut lead supply times.
In so doing, the group is starting to lay down rules for the retail sector
in a way that no US chain has done before. 'Wal-Mart is the biggest single
influence in US retailing,' says Ms Dorothy Lakner, an analyst with
Oppenheimer, the US financial services group.
Perhaps not just in the US. Retailing does not cross national boundaries
easily, but ideas do get swapped. The international spread of discount (or
'value') shopping, for example, is evident in the arrival of Germany's Aldi
group and the Danish Netto chain in the UK.
Wal-Mart's position today is all the more impressive when put in
perspective. In 1950, Mr Sam Walton, a former trainee with the J C Penney
retail group, lost the lease on a Ben Franklin-franchised variety store in
Newport, Arkansas. After complex negotiating, he secured a new property in
the tiny northern Arkansas town of Bentonville. Here, he opened the first
Walton's 5 &amp; 10, a small general goods store.
Forty years later, Bentonville is still the headquarters for more than 1,700
Wal-Mart stores, about 208 Sam's Warehouse Clubs and four hypermarkets.
These are served by 20 distribution centres, employ 365,000 people, and
capital expenditure runs at more than Dollars 2bn a year. Mr Walton, now 73,
and his four children ranked third last year in Fortune's list of the 500
richest Americans.
For years, observers have tried to define the ingredients of this success.
Their answers usually mention Wal-Mart's traditional small-town base - where
land costs are low, and shrinkage (or 'lost' stocks) and other operational
problems are more manageable.
Then there is the meticulous attention to cost, and the fact that prices
are, indeed, kept very low. (In Dover, a quart of bleach costs 89 cents in
Wal-Mart and Dollars 1.14 at Ames.) This is partly because Wal-Mart's staff
is non-unionised, and 40 per cent work part-time, saving the company
insurance and holiday expenses, while executives occupy shoe box offices.
Success is also attributed to the company's willingness to innovate or, at
least, to poach successful ideas. Warehouse clubs are a good example. These
barns, which sell a limited range of goods at wholesale prices to
'membership' customers, were developed by a Californian retailer in the
mid-1970s. Wal-Mart latched on to the notion within a decade - well before
competitors like K mart, which subsequently bought the PACE club chain.
Not all schemes work so well. Wal-Mart borrowed the hypermarket concept from
Europe, and built four - all at least 220,000 square feet. Now it says they
are too large to manage efficiently, and will not add more.
But whatever the key to Wal-Mart's past success, the question is whether the
group can sustain its explosive growth, as competition grows from the likes
of Dayton Hudson's Target chain and K mart.
The first expansion route is geographical. Wal-Mart is concentrated in the
south and mid-west, only recently tackling the north-east and west and
taking tentative steps into Mexico. 'There's so much opportunity out there,'
says Mr David Glass, Wal-Mart's chief executive. 'We have gone from Dollars
32.6bn in sales in 1990-91 to almost Dollars 44bn last year, and I can
envisage us layering on Dollars 10bn-Dollars 12bn this year.'
One potential problem with this strategy is that it may raise costs. 'If
they want to go after the New York, Los Angeles or Chicago markets, it's a
different ball-game,' says Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Heinz, a Wal-Mart
supplier. 'Real estate becomes expensive and there are all sorts of union
problems.' Used to hearing such concerns, Mr Glass shakes his head, pointing
out that Wal-Mart already has stores around Houston, Dallas, and even in
Chicago's suburbs.
As well as new sites, however, Wal-Mart's long-term plans depend on new
product areas - notably food retailing. Sam's Clubs have already taken the
Wal-Mart group into bulk food items in a big way. But now the company is
experimenting with 'supercentres', which combine supermarket facilities with
general merchandise. It plans to double the number to about 20 this year.
Manufacturers, meanwhile, may have shuddered at Wal-Mart's experiments in
selling colas, cookies and snacks under the Sam's Choice name. In general,
US shoppers view own-label products as cheap but inferior - giving brand
manufacturers considerable clout. But Sam Walton is a household name, and
Sam's Choice may convey more sense of quality.
Wal-Mart itself is ambivalent about the potential. '(The targeted own-label
segments) are generally difficult products to merchandise,' says Mr Glass.
'You buy soft drinks regionally, you buy them at all kinds of prices. Other
categories are simply those where there has been a big increase in brand
prices, and you're getting consumer resistance.'
So is Wal-Mart saying that when suppliers fail to meet its requirements, it
will crack the whip by introducing competing own-label products? 'Oh no;'
Wal-Mart's chief executive looks pained. 'We wouldn't do that - we believe
we are partners with our suppliers.'
But underlying such expansion tactics is a more fundamental question. How
far can any retailer grow before operations become unmanageable and
standards slip?
It is a conundrum to which no one has an answer. Wal-Mart has surpassed K
mart and Sears Roebuck, which seemed to stall when their merchandise sales
reached some Dollars 30bn during the 1980s. Asked about estimates that
Wal-Mart could see annual sales of Dollars 100bn this century, Mr Glass says
this is 'do-able'. 'But that's a pretty ambitious plan,' he adds quickly,
'because no retailer has ever done Dollars 100bn before, and I'm not sure
that any of us know what you'd have to do to be able to achieve it.'
Retail analysts suggest that part of the answer may lie in technology, and
Wal-Mart seems to agree. It makes much of the 'retail link' scheme, which
plugs suppliers into point-of-sale data in individual stores. Although only
a fifth of its 5,000 vendors have been persuaded to invest so far, overall
average lead times are said to have fallen from double figures a year ago,
to nine days.
The retailer also suggests that increased efficiency is the reason for a
recent move to eliminate manufacturers' representatives, the traditional
middlemen, from negotiations with suppliers. 'If you have a manufacturer and
you do Dollars 50m with him one year, and say you'll probably do Dollars
100m next . . . many of them have trouble relating to that,' says Mr Glass.
'Where you have a third party involved it becomes particularly difficult.'
The representatives, for their part, protest that they are essential to
small manufacturers, and have tried to take the matter to the Federal Trade
Commission, the US competition watchdog. They also hint that Wal-Mart's real
aim is better terms from manufacturers.
Whatever the merits of the argument, most observers suspect that the
discount chain will win - at least, where larger suppliers are concerned.
Already, Procter &amp; Gamble, probably Wal-Mart's largest supplier, is reported
to have a team living in Bentonville.
And if anyone doubts the seriousness of Wal-Mart's ambitions, they should
visit its computer room. 'I don't think many people know this exists,'
confesses one employee, opening the door on a room the size of a football
pitch. Bentonville may just have seen the future.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Texts for the Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tories badly need a text. When Mrs Margaret Thatcher was leader, voters
knew what she stood for. They made a choice. At the general elections of
1979, 1983 and 1987 her party attracted 42-44 per cent of the vote, enough
to give her three smashing victories. Nobody is clear about where Mr John
Major stands, which is one reason why the Conservatives have recently been
unable to approach the 41-43 per cent required if they are to have a hope of
winning a working majority.
Poor Mr Major. When he took over, most people wanted a complete break with
Thatcherism, while most of his party workers sought continuity. He replaced
the poll tax and re-aligned Britain's stance within the European Community.
He developed the Citizen's Charter, a sensible set of rules for improving
relations between producers and consumers of public services. In
desperation, and too late, he has become a proponent of a large budget
deficit in times of recession. For the rest, he has been obliged to offer
warmed-over Thatcherism.
Leave aside the merits of the above decisions. The Conservatives' problem is
that, taken as a whole, they do not appear to have a mission. It will take
all the power of Mr Chris Patten's magic pen to produce an election
manifesto that does not resemble a mish-mash of familiar slogans about
choice and responsibility, laced with a few one-off wheezes that have
managed to pass the Treasury.
Mr Patten may draw inspiration from a forthcoming book, Modern Conservatism,
by David Willetts (Penguin, Pounds 5.99). Mr Willetts, a former private
secretary to Mr Nigel Lawson, served in Mrs Thatcher's policy unit before
becoming director of studies at the Centre for Policy Studies. His
questioning of the welfare state (notably on family policy) once sounded
extreme, but in recent years, perhaps since deciding to stand for
parliament, he has moved towards the Conservative mainstream.
Did I say mainstream? Has there been any such thing since 1979? Hold on. The
explanation is coming. The modern Conservatism of Mr Willetts' title has, in
his view, been the mainstream since the end of the Second World War. It
combines a commitment to freedom, and free markets, with an acceptance of
'large parts of the welfare state, but on sound conservative grounds'.
To what will be the astonishment of those who think otherwise of Mrs
Thatcher and her brains' trust, he quotes the One Nation group of Tory MPs -
'one of the most significant movements of the 20th-century parliamentary
Conservative party, and one of the most misunderstood'.
The founders of the group 'were actually much less interventionist than the
inter-war generation of Conservatives'. In 1950, One Nation, the group's
first publication, argued for liberalising planning control and deregulating
Mr Willetts seeks to reconcile free markets with the sense of community
the construction industry. The group's 1954 pamphlet on economic policy,
whose authors included Enoch Powell and Angus Maude, favoured a return to 'a
more competitive system'.
The 'One Nation' concept thus rehabilitated, Mr Willetts offers no balm to
wets, who 'believe in a bigger role for government and looser financial
policies', as against his preferred drys, who 'believe in less government
intervention but within the framework of a sound financial policy'. (What
will he call Mr Major after the Budget? Wet behind the ears?) The erratic
forces in post-war Tory history were those supreme wets, Harold Macmillan
and, following his U-turns, Edward Heath. Mrs Thatcher turns out to be a
traditional Conservative, One Nation thinking included. What makes her
different is her character, reflected in her energy, her ability to
illustrate by practical example and her decisions on which issues to fight.
Mr Willets seeks to reconcile free markets, 'which deliver freedom and
prosperity' with a recognition of the importance of community, 'which
sustains our values'. He rejects the economic liberal, or 'rigorous
free-marketeer', who 'sees life as a giant supermarket'. Conservatives are
bound by loyal ties to historic communities, and an understanding of the
rule of law. They do not accept markets and the price mechanism everywhere.
'You cannot sell your children. You cannot sell your vote . . .'
Other values prevail. 'A shared cultural tradition, limited government, the
free market, the welfare state and loyalty to the central institutions of
the nation-state, are the integrating forces in which a Conservative
trusts.' These are not left-wing values; in particular, he warns that 'there
are perfectly good Conservative arguments for publicly financed education,
health care and a social security system which have nothing to do with
equality'.
Mr Major's ministers are wrestling with just such arguments right now. Mr
Willetts' book is therefore an important text. It could bridge the gap
between pre-and post-Thatcher conservatism. What it does not do is explain -
to my satisfaction at least - how contemporary Tories reconcile their
beliefs in freedom and community with their rejection of Scotland's
aspirations for home rule, their destruction of local government (which Mr
Willetts seems to deplore), and their blind refusal to link constitutional
reform with the protection of the individual and the community from an
overmighty executive. Perhaps the reason is that the Tories expect to be the
executive most of the time.
Co-incidentally, the One Nation group has just produced a pamphlet, One
Nation 2000, which aims 'to create a Britain in which the growing prosperity
of the fortunate is reflected in the better welfare of the disadvantaged . .
.' It argues for policies that go beyond 'giving most weight to the
individual as the key element in society'. Something more is needed, it
says, 'on which to build the policies of the 1990s'. Now there's a text for
Mr Patten.

FT  03 MAR 92 / The appliance of commerce: Wellcome's increasing presence in
the international pharmaceuticals market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What would Sir Henry Wellcome think? The company he founded in 1880 to make
'compressed medicines' or tablets, has become one of the world's
fastest-growing pharmaceuticals businesses.
Now, with the proposed sale by the medical charity, Wellcome Trust, of much
of its controlling stake, the company will fully enter the commercial world.
It will have to satisfy the more rigorous demands of institutional
shareholders but will have greater management freedom to run its business.
Since 25 per cent of Wellcome's shares were floated on the stock market in
1986 it has become one of the largest public companies in the UK. The Trust,
to which Sir Henry bequeathed the company, has seen the value of its
shareholding grow to a point where it feels it must reduce its 73.6 per cent
shareholding to diversify its investments.
At the time of the flotation Sir Alfred Shepperd, the chairman and chief
executive who retired in 1990, insisted that the group was a commercial
business, run to make profits. Since then the company has become a much
stronger competitor in the world drugs industry.
As one industry observer put it: 'The company had a pretty closeted past.'
Research scientists could enjoy working at Wellcome as though it were an
academic institution. The company would pursue the scientifically
fascinating rather than the commercially promising.
But that has all changed. Mr John Robb, chief executive of Wellcome, has
been pursuing a restructuring programme aimed at sharpening the business and
increasing profit margins. The strategy is nearing completion and he now
supports the Trust's plans to sell a large part of its stake. Previously he
had feared such a large sale would have been disruptive.
As part of this programme, several tough decisions have been taken. The
group gave up work on TPA, a blood clot dissolving drug. That was hard, Mr
Robb says, after more than Pounds 40m had been spent on it. But Wellcome
realised it would be difficult to make a commercial success of the product.
Other measures have included the sale of peripheral activities where margins
were low. These included businesses, such as vaccines, to which Wellcome had
a strong sentimental attachment. There have been cuts in overheads,
including about 10 per cent of the 400 jobs at its London head office.
Wellcome has also made a much more determined effort to market its drugs.
As a result the company's fast profit growth, which had slowed in the
1989-90 financial year, has resumed. This year pre-tax profits are forecast
to top Pounds 500m, a rise from Pounds 402.9m in 1990-91. And the balance
sheet is strong, with net cash of about Pounds 200m at the end of August
last year.
The story of Wellcome's stock market career has been dominated by Retrovir,
its high-profile Aids drug. Launched in 1987, it is still the only widely
used treatment for the condition. The company's share price has fallen and,
more often, risen with the ebb and flow of news about Retrovir.
But there is more to the company's drugs profile. It has arguably the best
record of any UK drug company for turning research and development into new
products. It has accelerated the rate at which it launches new drugs,
developing a product almost every year for the past decade.
Wellcome's strength in research and its dominance of the anti-viral market
have been the basis of its growth. But the therapeutic power of its products
had not been matched by its salesmanship.
Its best-selling drug, Zovirax, used to treat herpes, shingles and now
chicken pox, was launched in 1981. Only now, as its patents are approaching
the end of their lives, is it realising its full sales potential of about
Pounds 500m a year. Since Mr Robb joined the company in March 1989 as deputy
chief executive, co-marketing deals and higher prices for Zovirax have
improved profit margins.
Both Retrovir and Zovirax faced the problem of being launched into a new
market, although the publicity surrounding Aids has meant a greater public
awareness of Retrovir. Its sales growth since its launch has outstripped
that of Zovirax in the initial years. 'Retrovir, too, was not as well
marketed as it might have been,' says Mr Jonathan de Pass, an industry
analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
The possibility that Wellcome is failing to maximise drugs sales and,
therefore, profits is also reflected in the company's 25 per cent gross
profit margin - lower than that of its competitors in the drugs business,
ICI, Glaxo or Fisons.
Wellcome's newfound marketing priority is important, too, in its
non-prescription drugs business. It is noted for its cough and cold
remedies, Actifed and Sudafed, and for other over-the-counter (OTC) products
that can be bought without a prescription, such as Calpol, a pain reliever
for infants. Aggressive marketing is also preparing the ground for the sale
of Zovirax as a treatment for cold sores, without a prescription.
Mr Robb denies that the business of selling low-technology OTC cures is out
of place in a research-driven company. He says: 'A significant position in
OTC will become increasingly important as pressure on prices of prescription
drugs increases.' As margins are squeezed on prescription drugs Wellcome can
turn to OTC drugs as a stable source of income.
While Glaxo, for example, disposed of its OTC drugs several years ago, Mr
Robb sees OTC as a means of extending the profit-earning life of a drug.
When a prescription drug loses its patent, rivals can produce the same drug
cheaply. But the hope is by turning a prescription drug into a branded
consumer product premium prices can be maintained. Already Zovirax is being
sold over the counter in New Zealand. SmithKline Beecham has a similar
philosophy. It has earmarked its ulcer treatment, Tagamet, once the world's
best-selling drug, for OTC sales to treat upset stomachs. Wellcome is
seeking a partner to expand its international OTC business. It hopes to
announce a deal this year.
Wellcome's need for marketing partners is not confined to OTC drugs. While
it is strong in selling anti-viral drugs, its new products - essential for
the group's profits growth - are in areas where it has little experience.
These include epilepsy, muscle relaxants (for operations), hepatitis-B and,
eventually, the potentially big market of migraine treatments. These new
drugs will need to compensate for the eventual decline of Zovirax.
Investors considering whether to buy the shares released by the Trust will
have to decide whether the promise of products in the pipeline will enable
Wellcome to continue its strong stock market performance.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Glasnost, Saudi style
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL reform and Saudi Arabia are not words which normally trip off the
tongue together. Oil revenues may have transformed the kingdom's economy
over the past few decades with astonishing speed. But in political terms it
surely remains one of the most conservative nations on earth, with a system
of power that has scarcely changed since the state was established 60 years
ago and a populace that seems disinclined to rock the boat.
Now at long last change of a modest and tentative variety is in the air. On
Sunday, King Fahd, fifth ruler of the state founded by his father,
Abdul-Aziz, issued three pieces of legislation that promise the first steps
towards broadening participation in government, and codifying the kingdom's
system of law. In particular, he promised the establishment of a
Consultative Council, whose 60 members he will appoint within the next six
months and which will be able to question government ministers.
The result will certainly not be democracy; nor is any real diminution
likely in the absolute power exercised by the House of Saud. But the
reforms, if implemented in the spirit which King Fahd appears to intend, may
help make the exercise of that power seem less arbitrary, provide a platform
for serious debate on the kingdom's future, and - perhaps - make the state's
affairs seem a shade more transparent to outsiders. Evolution in any of
these directions would be welcome - not least to foreign investors and
traders, for whom the kingdom is among the most opaque and unpredictable
places to do business.
Smooth succession
Just as important to Saudis and outsiders who prize stability in a country
that contains a quarter of the world's known oil reserves, the king has
probably helped to smooth the succession within the royal family by setting
up what amounts to an electoral college of 500 younger princes.
Sunday's move was not exactly precipitate. Fahd has been promising to set up
an advisory council since well before he became king in 1982; indeed, he has
raised and then apparently shelved the idea so often that the more
modern-minded of his subjects could be forgiven a certain scepticism about
his current intentions.
Nevertheless, there are reasons to believe that the king is now in earnest.
For one thing, he is not acting in isolation: among other Gulf states, Oman
has established its own consultative assembly in the past year and Kuwait -
which had a relatively well-established parliamentary tradition until its
National Assembly was suspended in 1986 - plans to hold elections this
autumn.
Greater openness
Demands for reform within the kingdom have been unmistakeable ever since the
Saudis invited the US-led military coalition to defend their territory after
Iraq invaded Kuwait. The presence of US troops emboldened the
western-educated bourgeoisie of civil servants and businessmen to demand
greater openness on the part of the government.
The ruling family, as ever, is engaged in a balancing act: its sensitivity
to criticism from the religious right means it will only go so far to
accommodate the modernisers. But in speaking out on Sunday in favour of
citizens' personal freedoms, King Fahd showed a heartening willingness to
take on the Islamic extremists who late last year were again causing
disruption in Saudi streets and homes.
The test now, assuming the Consultative Council goes ahead, will be the list
of members. They will have to represent the broadest range of opinions in
the kingdom, from reactionary religious fundamentalist to western-educated
technocrat, if the Council is to command credibility. Ideally, the Shia
Moslem minority in the kingdom's eastern province would also have a voice.
What is clear is that a system which relies on individual petition as the
basic means of communication between ruler and ruled is no longer adequate
for Saudi Arabia's needs, and that Saudis will welcome the establishment of
a more representative body. The king, for his part, will find that freer
expression bolsters rather than threatens his throne.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): When the salesman is less
than frank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frankers, the machines which stamp your mail and automatically calculate
your postal charges, have attracted more than their share of unscrupulous
salesmen over the years, writes Charles Batchelor.
But there are signs that the industry is tightening up its standards.
This was the conclusion of a review of the franking machine market carried
out by What to Buy for Business*, a monthly consumer report on business
equipment and services.
There was a sharp fall in the number of complaints from franker users
compared with a previous survey in 1990, the latest edition of the magazine
reported.
Despite this improvement, businesses which use franking machines (and other
items of office equipment) should still keep an eye open for sharp practice,
it warned.
A common claim from rogue salesmen was that a machine was no longer usable
because it was obsolete, overworked or could not be repaired.
Some salesmen claimed, untruthfully, that the Post Office had withdrawn
approval for a particular model. In fact, the Post Office has never
withdrawn approval for any franking machine, the magazine said.
A common scare tactic was to claim that a machine was overcharging because
of its deteriorating condition or that it would cost more to repair than to
replace.
Users should check such claims with the service engineer, who is more likely
to give unbiased information, or with the Post Office. There should be no
need to replace equipment which is in working order, however old or
unfashionable it may look.
Frankers have an average working life of about eight years and one user said
his was 20 years old.
Salesmen sometimes claimed that the lease on a machine had to be renewed,
often years before the actual expiry date. Some salesmen even attempted to
tell businesses which had bought their machines that the lease was up.
One claimed that the users were not allowed to own a machine and tried to
take it away for replacement with one which was leased.
Since office staff change and new employees may be unaware of the financing
arrangement for a machine, details of the length of lease or whether the
franker has been bought should be displayed on the machine with a note of
where the paperwork can be found.
A good way to get rid of salesmen was to ask them to put the claims in
writing, the magazine suggested.
Companies leasing a new franker should read the contract carefully and not
sign in a hurry just because a discount is offered.
The manufacturers have been making efforts to improve the quality of their
service so, if you are dissatisfied, What to Buy advised: complain.
*No 132/March 1992. What to Buy for Business, Central House, 27 Park Street,
Croydon, Surrey CR0 1YD. Tel 081 680 2828. Twelve issues Pounds 105.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Union complains of rise in attacks at
benefit offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIOLENT attacks on staff in unemployment benefit offices and Jobcentres have
increased by 50 per cent since the removal of protective screens began in
1989, the CPSA Civil Service union said yesterday
The union warned that long-standing industrial action could intensify unless
the removal process was halted.
Publication of the figures is the latest move in the dispute over the
government's decision to move to open-plan offices without security screens
or counters. The industrial action, which started in April last year, has
cost the union Pounds 1m.
The CPSA dispute involves about 100 benefit-office staff who have have been
on strike for nearly a year in Bristol, Newcastle upon Tyne and London.
There was also a one-day national strike last November and other lightning
strikes.
The union wants security arrangements in offices to be negotiated locally,
with independent assessment of risks at offices before security arrangements
are altered. It has called on the Health and Safety Executive to act.
Mr John Macreadie, CPSA general secretary, said: 'At the same time that
counters and security screens are being removed, the frustration of
claimants and job seekers is growing. We have a lethal cocktail of anger and
despair and this is no time to strip our members of security.'
The union said there had been 233 attempted and actual physical assaults in
1990. It predicted that the level would turn out to have been maintained
last year and would rise. Before screens and counters were removed, the
number was 155.
The employment department disputed the union figures, saying there were 118
physical assaults in 1989, 161 in 1990 and 152 last year. Its figures do not
include attempted assaults.
The Bifu bank workers' union last week produced figures showing that raids
on banks and building societies in London had doubled over the past year.
Bifu is pressing for more and better security screens.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Boost for Tecs on specialist training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAINING and Enterprise Councils will from next month be given financial
incentives to train people with reading or numeracy difficulties.
Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, made the announcement at the
launch of Grand Metropolitan Trust's training centre in east London. The
trust is one of the largest providers of training to young people and the
adult unemployed, and many of its clients have special needs.
Government funding through Tecs of training for people with special needs
has been criticised, particularly by voluntary groups which have provided
most of such training.
Provision for people with special needs has suffered disproportionately from
cuts in training budgets, it is claimed, because Tecs have favoured
candidates who can get qualifications most quickly. Part of Tecs' funding is
related to the qualifications trainees achieve.
Mr Howard said: 'From next month achievement by those with severe literacy
or numeracy needs will be recognised.' This will be because the acquisition
of new qualifications which certify numeracy and literacy will count towards
the output-related part of funding.
Astra Training Services, created in a management buy-out of government
skillcentres, has raised nearly Pounds 20m from new investors including
Schroder Ventures, the venture capital group, which is investing Pounds 5m
in return for an equity stake.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Inequality reported in acting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTRESSES are paid less than half as much as actors, according to research
into the broadcast media published yesterday.
The report, which was commissioned by Equity, the actors' union, found that
on average men earned Pounds 53,814 and women Pounds 26,591 per year in
television, film, radio and commercials in the past three years.
The research found that median pay, a more realistic guide because of the
wide spread of earnings, was Pounds 15,000 for men and Pounds 8,350 a year
for women.
Men played two lead roles for every one played by a woman on television and
three for every one on radio. Men were paid significantly more than women
for comparable roles.
The report also found that women's employment began to decline after the age
of 30. In the age group 40 to 49 years, there are two men working for every
woman.
Ms Juliet Stevenson, star of the acclaimed film Truly, Madly, Deeply, said:
'There only seems to be room for a handful of women in middle age but men in
middle age can sustain careers all over the place.'

FT  03 MAR 92 / Lords to hear test Sunday trading case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE LAW LORDS agreed yesterday to hear legal arguments from Sir Patrick
Mayhew, the attorney-general, in a critical test appeal on Sunday trading,
in spite of opposition from the retailer directly involved in the case.
The appeal, brought by Kirklees Borough Council, West Yorkshire, seeks to
overturn an appeal court judgment in April which made Sunday trading
restrictions in England and Wales virtually unenforceable and led to the
current Sunday opening by supermarket chains.
In the Lords appeal, which began yesterday, the attorney-general intervened
on the side of local authorities attempting to restore their ability to
enforce the Sunday trading laws pending a conclusive ruling from the
European Court.
Mr Andrew Collins QC, representing Wickes Building Supplies, the DIY
retailer, accused Sir Patrick of 'muddling' his legal and political roles.
The attorney-general had not chosen to take the case over as he could have
done, and had indicated in the Commons that enforcement of the laws was a
matter not for him but for the local authorities. In his legal role it was
appropriate that the attorney-general should assist the law lords, but in
his political role he had 'no business' supporting Kirklees.
Mr Stuart Isaacs, QC for Kirklees, said the Court of Appeal ruling last year
had emasculated the Sunday trading law. Local authorities were in a cleft
stick, with retailers saying the law could not be enforced, and pressure
groups insisting that it must be.
The appeal, expected to last four days, is the second in a year to reach the
Lords concerning the alleged incompatibility of the Sunday trading laws in
England and Wales with the provision of European Community law on the free
movement of goods.
The previous case was referred to the European Court in May. A hearing has
yet to be fixed and a ruling is unlikely before the end of the year.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Bank staff press for staged deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNION representing most staff at Barclays Bank has asked the company to
offer a staged pay deal after its members rejected an offer worth an average
of 3 per cent.
Under the proposal from Barclays Group Staff Union, the present offer would
be implemented immediately and backdated to February, the settlement month.
It wants a further rise to follow later in the year.
The Barclays pay talks are among the first of the year in the
financial-services sector, and negotiations are being watched closely by
Midland and National Westminster banks and other companies in the sector.
The offer is one of the lowest in the sector in recent years, and the Bifu
financial services union, which also has members at Barclays, is advocating
industrial action.
The proposed deal will be compared with a settlement at Abbey National,
another of the sector's pace-setters, under which salaries of 'effective
performers' would be backdated to February 1 by 5.4 per cent.
The Barclays offer, covering non-managerial staff, would lead to rises of
between Pounds 230 and Pounds 535 a year. Unions estimate they are worth
between 2.5 per cent and 4 per cent.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Furniture workers consider a merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FTAT, the furniture union, has held exploratory talks with several large
unions including the TGWU general workers' grouping about a merger.
Mr Colin Christopher, FTAT general secretary, said the recession 'has
knocked us sideways'.
The union lost 10 per cent of its membership last year and expects to go
into deficit next year for the first time since the mid 1980s. Many larger
unions would be interested in a merger because of its 32,000 members and
considerable assets.
'We are still financially sound, but we have to look to the future and that
might have to include a merger,' Mr Christopher said. 'We are just fishing
around at the moment.'
He believes the greatest industrial logic lies in a merger with the Ucatt
construction union. But talks between the two have been called off because
of organisational difficulties within Ucatt.
FTAT has also spoken to the MSF technical union and the GMB general union,
and talks are planned with the Usdaw shopworkers' union.
Mr Christopher said FTAT would be 'a very attractive asset' for any large
union, but stressed that, because of their craft tradition, members would
not want to lose their identity in a merger and would expect to be offered
their own section.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Legal action to recover losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER THE past two years several thousand Lloyd's Names have taken legal
action to recover insurance losses. They are suing their agents or the
Lloyd's Corporation, the body which provides regulatory and market back-up
services.
Actions settled recently
Some 500 Names on Warrilow 553 won a Pounds 4m out-of-court settlement
including legal costs on February 7 (represented by Elborne Mitchell).
A group of 987 Names on Outhwaite syndicate 317/661's 1982 year won a Pounds
116m out-of-court settlement on February 12 (Richards Butler).
Actions under way
A group of 33 Names is suing Lloyd's alleging it negligently failing to
close the Oakeley Vaughan agency before the syndicates it managed ran up
heavy losses (Michael Freeman).
About 175 Names from Aragorn syndicate 384's 1985 year agreed to take legal
action last week in a bid to recover insurance losses (Macfarlanes).
Writs have been issued and served in three other cases. More than 400 Names
on Pulbrook syndicate 90's 1982 year; more than 320 of the 570 Names on
Pulbrook 334 in 1985; and more than 400 of the 800 Names on Poland
syndicates 105 (1985 year) and 108 (1986 year). All three groups are advised
by solicitors DJ Freeman and are alleging breach of contract and
misrepresentation by members' agents and negligence by managing agents.
At least 91 US Names allege Lloyd's breached US securities laws when they
were recruited. They are represented by Proskauer Rose, the New York firm.
Cases in Denver and Chicago are being fought by individual Names. In Canada
about 70 Names - represented by the Toronto law firm McCarthy Tetrault - are
in the midst of a case against Lloyd's. They are appealing against a verdict
in Lloyd's favour on a preliminary issue, but have so far successfully
prevented banks from drawing down their deposits.
More than 600 Names on Feltrim, Devonshire, Gooda Walker and Rose Thomson
Young syndicates, represented by Michael Freeman, are issuing motions to
seek an injunction preventing Lloyd's from drawing down their deposits.
Injunctions are against agents - following the decision by Lloyd's to
contest the action. Agents have agreed to freeze deposits until court
hearings. These are expected around March 26.
Possible actions
Gooda Walker Names Association has asked both Withers and Michael Freeman to
represent its members.
Feltrim Names Association (Richards Butler).
Devonshire Names Association (Norton Rose).
Rose Thomson Young (Withers).

FT  03 MAR 92 / Lloyd's ball bounces in the solicitors' court: A look at the
complex collection of cases being prepared on behalf of anxious Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are busy times for Mr Michael Freeman, senior partner in a small
solicitors' firm in London's West End.
Last week he was in the House of Lords arguing a technical point of law
arising from a legal action he is conducting on behalf of 33 Lloyd's Names
from the defunct 1981-82 Oakeley Vaughan syndicate.
The Names - individuals whose capital backs underwriting at the Lloyd's
insurance market - claim Lloyd's was negligent in not closing down Oakeley
Vaughan and that it failed to warn them of an unfavourable internal report
on their syndicate and its underwriters.
Mr Freeman was also busy co-ordinating an action on behalf of more than 600
Names to prevent Lloyd's drawing on the cash deposits or bank guarantees
individuals put up to cover loses when they become Names. This move
threatens to compromise the market's ability to meet claims.
The position was complicated by the decision of Lloyd's to defend the
action. but Mr Freeman has to issue individual writs on behalf of each of
the Names involved.
Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, has warned Names that the actions
will fail and add legal costs to the bills they already face. He has also
said that Lloyd's would meet insurance claims over the next month that would
otherwise be met from the funds deposited by Names, and that Names would
eventually have to meet the cost. Faced with heavy losses, many Names cannot
afford a protracted legal battle.
Many lawyers in the City feel that Mr Freeman's action is unlikely to do
more than delay the inevitable - but this may not matter.
What Names want most, say many lawyers, is some form of settlement which
avoids the need for them to take protracted legal action and offers
financial help with their losses. They argue that Lloyd's faces legal action
from disgruntled Names on so many fronts that it could crash unless a rescue
package is mounted soon to provide the cash to meet outstanding claims.
Mr Guy Sutton, a partner with City solicitors Norton Rose, is co-ordinating
claims by 150 Names who belonged to the Lime Street members' agency, which
has ceased trading. Their claims are typical of potential lawsuits by Names.
The allegations about Lime Street include failure to follow instructions,
professional incompetence in placing husband and wife Names on the same
high-risk catastrophe reinsurance syndicates, and the placing of Names on a
higher proportion of high-risk syndicates than was prudent.
Some Lime Street Names have joined actions against the syndicates run by
Feltrim and Gooda Walker. Most of those actions - like the recently settled
Outhwaite litigation - turn on the issue of underwriting negligence. For the
rest the only course has been to instruct Norton Rose to write to Lloyd's
and request an inquiry into Lime Street.
That letter was sent in December, and Lloyd's has set up five inquiries into
the biggest loss-making syndicates in 1988, the latest year to report. But
Norton Rose says Lloyd's has done nothing about Lime Street except refer the
case to its professional conduct department.
Mr Sutton believes the crisis at Lloyd's is so serious that the government
or the Bank of England will have to step in and provide the cash needed for
Lloyd's to pay claims. That would be followed by a rescue scheme allowing
Names to escape liability for some losses and pay the remainder over a
period of time.
He says a rescue package is unlikely to come from 'mutualisation' -
spreading losses among Names who have made money in recent years. They will
be reluctant to pick up the tab for others they feel have been misinformed,
misled or just plain foolish.
'It is very important for the City that Lloyd's survives,' Mr Sutton says.
'To be honest, if it wasn't for the fact that we are facing an imminent
election I would have expected some kind of rescue to have been organised by
now.'
Lawyers themselves have not escaped without blame. There is a view growing
in the City that the only people who stand to gain from the present
situation were the lawyers. Cynics suspect that in these recessionary times
lawyers are only too willing to encourage actions against Lloyd's.
This is a little unfair. One thing law firms do not lack in a recession is
litigation work. Firms involved in the Lloyd's lawsuits are also, with the
possible exception of Michael Freeman, recognised insurance experts.
Norton Rose is one of the UK's top 10 law firms by size, and is rated in the
top three for commercial litigation. Richards Butler and DJ Freeman are also
in the top 50 by size, and Elborne Mitchell is in the top 100 in London.
Few Names faced with losses could afford the Pounds 250 to Pounds 300 an
hour normally charged by these firms. Because the Names' circumstances vary
so much there is no prospect of clubbing together in a group action.
If lawyers become bogged down in protracted litigation on behalf of Names,
there is a very real prospect that, if they are paid, it may be at a vastly
reduced rate. That would render the work barely profitable.
Many of the Lime Street Names who clubbed together to instruct Norton Rose
to write to Lloyd's have joined the litigation against Lloyd's launched in
November by New York lawyers Proskauer Rose under the US 'no win, no pay'
contingent fee system.
In the UK it appears to be in everyone's interests to reach an out-of-court
settlement. If the government does not mount a rescue scheme, there may be
much to be said for the suggestion from Mr Ian Hay Davison, former deputy
chairman and chief executive of Lloyd's, that an effective arbitration
process might provide the best way out.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Judge rules against three Names in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEGAL ruling in the US against the Lloyd's of London insurance market was
overturned in a Chicago district court yesterday. Judge Charles Norgle
overturned a decision made last September by magistrate Ms Joan Gottschall
in favour of two Names, Mr Kenneth Bonny and Mrs Francesca Bonny. A third
Name subsequently joined the action.
Several cases are being brought against Lloyd's in the US by loss-making
Names - individuals whose capital backs underwriting at Lloyd's.
The three Names whose cases were heard yesterday alleged that agreements
signed with Lloyd's and the agents who handle their affairs should not be
enforced because Names' rights to the protection of US securities laws take
precedence.
The court upheld Lloyd's contention that under the agreements any dispute
must be heard in an English court. A Lloyd's motion to dismiss the entire
case is pending before the same judge. Last autumn a federal judge in Denver
found that the US courts had no jurisdiction over similar plaintiffs'
claims. An appeal has been lodged against that ruling.
The US courts have still to hear a third case brought against Lloyd's and a
group of agents by 91 US Names.
In the UK a High Court judge will today hear a motion by Lloyd's to have
litigation between it, members' agents and Names transferred to the
commercial court. Several hundred Names are seeking injunctions to prevent
Lloyd's drawing down their deposits in order to meet cash calls.
The agents have agreed to freeze the deposits temporarily pending a full
court hearing which is expected to begin later this month.
Meanwhile Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investments
Board, is expected to begin his investigation into alleged malpractices at
Lloyd's this week.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Shetland opposes separate self-rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHETLANDERS have little interest in seeking separate independence from
Britain if Scotland were to become independent, Mr Edward Thomason, convener
of Shetland Islands council, said yesterday.
The question has become significant because an independent Shetland could,
along with an independent Orkney, lay claim to a large part of the North Sea
oil and gas fields. If England also drove a hard bargain, a Scottish
government could have less than 10 per cent of North Sea oil revenues.
The airing of the Shetland question comes in the latest North Sea oil report
by County NatWest WoodMac, the broker.
It says the maximum North Sea oil revenues Scotland could expect over the
next five years would be Pounds 17bn, at this year's prices, out of a total
Pounds 18bn.
This assumes that the border between the English and Scottish sectors was
drawn due east from Berwick-on-Tweed. If the direction of the land border
between England and Scotland was continued into the sea and if Shetland and
Orkney took their share of the oilfields then Scottish revenue could be as
little as Pounds 1.5bn.
Some 65 per cent of Scottish business leaders want no change in
constitutional arrangements, according to a survey by Euram Consulting, the
executive recruitment agency.
Of the 35 per cent of replies from 515 questionnaires, 23 per cent wanted a
form of Scottish parliament with tax-raising powers to replace the existing
regional councils, 2 per cent wanted a tax-raising assembly on top of the
regional councils and 6 per cent wanted total independence.

FT  03 MAR 92 / PSBR study may blunt Kinnock claims on tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY might have unwittingly handed the government a way of escaping
Labour party charges that it will be 'borrowing to bribe' the electorate in
next week's Budget.
By citing a German 'golden rule' for public finance Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, could justify more than doubling the government deficit in
1992-93 if he so wished.
An analysis of UK public-sector capital spending in the latest issue of the
Treasury Bulletin suggests that even a public-sector borrowing requirement
(PSBR) of close to Pounds 30bn in the coming financial year  - against an
expected Pounds 12bn for this year - could be justified as covering
government investment.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, last week contrasted Tory plans for
'borrowing to bribe' the electorate through tax cuts and a higher PSBR in
the forthcoming Budget with Labour's commitment to 'borrowing to build'
through higher government investment in public services.
But the Treasury study shows that on one definition the government should be
able to claim that sharply higher borrowing expected for 1992-93 will do no
more than cover public-sector capital spending. In that way, Britain would
be conforming to what economists call the 'golden rule'.
This rule, a cornerstone of German fiscal policy, stipulates that the amount
the government borrows should not exceed the amount it invests in any given
period.
Next year's official target for the PSBR is one of the most closely guarded
Budget secrets. But there is no doubt that it will be sharply higher than
the total for the 1991-92 financial year. The final figure is generally
expected to be between Pounds 24bn and Pounds 30bn.
Problems arise, however, when an attempt is made to relate British PSBR
figures to measures of investment because, according to the Treasury, there
are at least four sets of statistics that can be used to define
public-sector capital spending.
Three sets of statistics show that public-sector investment in recent years
has been well below the likely PSBR for 1992-93.
However, the Treasury has compiled a fourth set of statistics - known as
'public-sector asset creation' - in which it calculates that public-sector
investment totalled Pounds 29bn in 1990-91 and estimates its outturn in the
current financial year at Pounds 28.6bn. These levels are roughly in line
with next year's expected PSBR.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Government U-turn on plans for A1
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday announced its conversion to the idea that the A1
road between Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh should be upgraded to dual
carriageway, James Buxton writes.
The transport department and the Scottish Office previously said the section
did not justify upgrading with only 20 per cent of traffic between England
and Scotland using it - although there are plans to upgrade the A1 from
London to Newcastle from dual carriageway to motorway.
Yesterday Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, and Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, Scottish Office roads minister, said they had concluded
that 'it would be desirable for the A1 to be fully dualled from Edinburgh to
Newcastle'.
Work on the project is due to start in May but no date was given for
completing it.
The ministers pointed out that construction work on making a section near
Berwick-on-Tweed dual-carriageway would begin by the end of May and that
other such schemes were being developed. Four small projects to ease
overtaking at blackspots on the Scottish section of the route are to be
studied. The total cost of schemes in progress or under consideration is
about Pounds 110m.
Campaigners on both sides of the border who have recently highlighted the
number of accidents on the single-carriageway road said that the statement
was 'little more than a pre-election gimmick'.

<TEXT>
ANY CHANGE to the uniform business rate in the Budget should not be allowed
to delay poll tax bills, Mr Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Labour-dominated
Association of Metropolitan Authorities, urged yesterday.
Mr Beecham wrote to Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, seeking
reassurance that 'the government is not planning a repeat of last year's
billing fiasco by implementing a late change in the national non-domestic
rate which would not affect the amount of poll tax to be paid, but which
could cause weeks of delay in sending out the 1992-93 poll tax bills'.
The Department of the Environment said that any potential change to the
business rate need not affect billing because the level of money from the
business-rate pool could be held steady by the government.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Computer software research wins Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is putting more money into research on ensuring that computer
software does what it is supposed to do and does not do anything that could
endanger life or the environment.
Yesterday it said an extra Pounds 6m would be made available to the
four-year Safety Critical Systems Programme run by the Department of Trade
and Industry and the Science and Engineering Research Council.
The funds are part of a Pounds 25m package announced yesterday to improve
software technology and applications, and brings to Pounds 36m the value of
the safety-work scheme.
Computer software is notoriously difficult to test for errors because of its
complexity and the number of different ways a computer can react to
differing circumstances. Fears that software controlling sophisticated
machinery may contain undetected errors have been highlighted by the crash
in January of an A320 Airbus, controlled by complex computer systems, even
though no errors were found in the software.
The DTI announced yesterday that Pounds 11.7m would be made available for
research into 'co-operative' working - allowing people in different
locations to work on the same information at the same time.
A further Pounds 7.5m was pledged to work on open, or industry-standard
systems to make different manufacturers' computers compatible. These are
increasingly seen as the pattern of the future.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Attorney-general urges quicker
trials - Fraud Cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR PATRICK MAYHEW, the attorney-general, yesterday called for speedier
justice in fraud trials.
In the Commons he said that recent cases involving Blue Arrow and Guinness
had lasted 'far too long'.
Mr John Morris, the shadow attorney-general, suggested that Lord Mackay of
Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor, should ask the Lord Chief Justice to set up
a committee of judges and barristers to consider changes in court procedure
and, if necessary, amending legislation.
Mr Morris said juries were 'unequalled in deciding dishonesty', but the
burden being imposed upon them by lengthy trials was becoming unfair.
He questioned why there had to be such a large number of charges and,
sometimes, of defendants, as well as long opening speeches and insufficient
identification of the issues for the jury until nearly the end of the trial.
Sir Patrick, who strongly defended the prosecution authorities, said the
lord chancellor would 'heed' the views expressed by Mr Morris.
He stressed that in the Blue Arrow case there had been only one charge, yet
comment upon it had included an assertion that there had been a 'scattergun'
approach by the Serious Fraud Office.
Sir Patrick said there had been five charges in the Guinness II trial, and
that in none of the most recent 20 cases had there been more than 22
charges. Some charges had been alternatives and every effort had been made
to bring matters into 'clear focus'.
Sir Patrick added that Mrs Edna Wijeratna, leader of the jury in the second
Guinness trial, had indicated in a letter in yesterday's Financial Times
that the prosecution had made 'a very good job of identifying the structure
of the case'.
Backbenchers from both sides of the Commons warned last night that changing
MPs working hours to ensure that the main business of the day is concluded
by 10 pm could result in 'making life easy' for the government.
Mr John MacGregor, leader of the House, confirmed that no changes will be
introduced before the general election.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: When an MP's past does the talking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN the most cautiously spoken politicians carry a past which might make
them blush now.
'Prices, of course, can only be controlled in two ways: either by government
subsidy or by government dictate,' Mr John Major wrote in the Hampstead and
Highgate Express during the February 1974 election when he was the Tory
candidate in the Labour seat of St Pancras North.
'I believe it is right to retain every method - including statutory powers -
to prevent inflation soaring still higher,' he told the paper in the October
campaign that year.
Though the problems and context may have changed, a politician's defence of
his party's record in power is reassuringly familiar from the current
economic debate.
'The Labour party are intent on blaming the Conservatives for each and every
price rise, despite the fact that they are well aware that most of the price
rises are the direct result of increasing prices overseas,' Mr Major argued
for the Heath government.
Reading the 'Ham and High' for 1974 also offers some signs of the Major
campaigning technique being honed. During his February campaign there was a
report that a Conservative typing error mistakenly attributed to the
Communist candidate Mr Major's own comment that 'Strife not conciliation is
the Communist policy'.
By the second time he fought the seat such problems seemed to have been
ironed out and the value of the photo-opportunity learnt. He arrived at
Camden Town Hall to pay his deposit, clutching a wad of Monopoly money 'to
emphasise to people that if Labour win an overall majority and implement
their policies then sterling will be as valueless as toy money'.
While his February election article was largely devoted to trade unions and
inflation, the one for October covered a doorstep issue. 'I have lost count
of the number of people who have said to me: 'Oh, yes, I know about
inflation, but I don't think any of you can do much about that. What really
worries me is the appalling 214 bus service . . .',' he wrote.
The politician's traditional lament about media bias, on the other hand,
seemed to come almost instinctively.
'I have found, since I became a prospective Conservative candidate in 1971,
that if I make an extreme comment it is far more likely to be printed than a
moderate statement,' he complained in February.
Describing himself as 'wary of being hyper-sensitive on this issue', he
still commented of the 'Ham and High' that 'no one who reads the editorials
could possibly doubt the political persuasions of the editor'.
Much of the 'Reds on the mantelpiece' rhetoric seems a world away from
politics now, but at least one of Mr Major's remarks may strike a chord with
voters looking ahead to this general election.
Musing on his defeat in the February poll, he said: 'There was a real
absence of feeling on the doorstep - no hostility, but also no enthusiasm.'

FT  03 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Parties clash over immigration
plans - Asylum Policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMMMIGRATION threatened to fight its way on to the election agenda last
night as Mr Roy Hattersley, the shadow home secretary, accused the Tories of
wanting the asylum bill to fail in order to capitalise on the race issue.
His charges came during a debate on asylum policy in which Mr Kenneth Baker,
the home secretary, said Labour was planning to relax rules preventing
overseas nationals resident in Britain from marrying to pass on UK
citizenship rights.
Opening the debate, Mr Baker forecast a 'very substantial' rise in would-be
spouses seeking entry to the UK if Labour changed the criteria used by
immigration officers.
He went on announce measures to crack down on fraudulent benefit claims by
asylum-seekers by restricting their income-support order books from 26 to
six weeks, payable only at nominated post offices.
Mr Baker said: 'For the bona fide asylum seeker, this will not be a
hardship. However, it will act as a deterrent for those intent on fraud.'
But his tough stance immediately provoked a defensive response from Mr
Hattersley. Insisting that Labour would introduce new objective criteria for
entry applications, he said it was wrong for decisions to be left to the
discretion of immigration officers.
The shadow home secretary gave notice that the Opposition suspected the
Conservatives wanted to shelve the bill in order to keep immigration alive
as an issue for the election.
'It may well be that you want the Asylum Bill to fail, and if that is the
case you can prevent its passage,' Mr Hattersley told the home secretary.
Pointing out that Labour had made clear it was ready to support updated
laws, he pressed for an Asylum Bill which deals with bogus applicants but
protects the genuine.
Mr Baker told the Commons that last year there were 44,000 asylum seekers
receiving income support.
The problem of multiple applications for asylum and social security had now
reached 'quite unacceptable levels,' he said.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Government defeat on inspectors -
Education Bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT may be forced to abandon efforts to hand responsibility for
the inspection of schools over to school governors after being 'ambushed' by
Labour peers last night.
In the surprise result of a vote on the Education (Schools) Bill, the Lords
decided by 95 to 67, a majority of 28, to amend legislation intended to
allow parents to choose school inspectors.
A second government defeat pushed through Labour's alternative proposal to
pass control from local education authorities to the national schools
inspectorate.
The vote represents a serious embarrassment to the government, which has
repeatedly trumpeted the controversial changes as a cornerstone of its
policy to shake up education by devolving powers to parents.
Commenting later, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, said: 'We will
have to decide what to do.
'If the Bill is of a form consistent with the Parent's Charter we will take
it through the Commons. If it is not, we will try to amend it.'
Labour has been widely expected to make political capital from attacking the
concept of 'privatised' inspections as a triumph of political dogma over
common sense.
Nonetheless, the government's defeat is an unwelcome reminder to its
business managers of the Conservatives' vulnerability to surprise attack.
While the Opposition may support other clauses, there are now doubts as to
whether there will be time to reverse last night's defeat if an April 9
election is called.
Before the vote, Baroness Blatch for the government warned the peers that
the amendment sought to 'tear the heart out of the bill'.
Afterwards, Mr Jack Straw. Labour's education spokesman, said: 'The bill was
a piece of wreckage before this defeat and now it is well on the way to
being sunk.'
Government ministers must now decide whether to attempt to reverse the
defeat next week, to accept the changes, or to abandon the inspection
elements in the bill.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Rip Van Roy's radicalism is
re-awakened - Campaign Profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Roy Hattersley's weaknesses are so widely caricatured, so publicly
displayed and so universally and joyously celebrated that his strengths tend
to be underestimated - even, perhaps, by himself.
Labour's deputy leader is endlessly pilloried for his self-confessed crime
of intellectual snobbery and his fondness for good living.
He might be more aptly reprimanded for being unconvincingly
self-deprecating, overweaningly loyal and for failing to throw his
indisputable weight around.
Urbane and provincial, imperious and blokish, fop and slob, Mr Hattersley is
known both for quoting stunningly obscure philosophers and supporting
Sheffield Wednesday.
These Jekyll and Hyde qualities are reflected in his two conflicting
reputations. While in Westminster, he is often depicted as almost too
semi-detached. Yet, he has also spent much of the last two months
energetically stomping the regions to sell a soundly old-fashioned vision of
socialism.
At little-reported Labour gatherings from Blackpool to York, he has reminded
his audiences that the party was in danger of forgetting its basic goal: the
redistribution of opportunity, privilege and wealth through a decisive
tipping of the political scales in favour of the powerless.
Back in London, Citizen Roy is more than aware that such robust sentiments
are out of place. Yet he doggedly refuses to substitute his eloquent quill
pen for the ubiquitous fax.
After all, when it was de rigeur to be left, he was unfashionably right. Now
that it is politically correct to be a pragmatic yuppy, he is irritated at
that old-style Labourism is seen as an embarrassing throwback to a past it
is now electorally advisable to forget.
'It is as if Roy has nodded off for a decade or so, then woken up to find
himself a leftwinger,' one youthful admirer observed recently.
Roy Sydney George (note the appropriate combination of no-nonsense Yorkshire
and pampered Hanoverian) Hattersley was born in Sheffield in 1932.
A grammar school boy whose mother once served as lord mayor his class
credentials do not run to claims of clogless deprivation. Rather, he seems
to have been a product of that sturdy municipalism lovingly recorded by JB
Priestley and Keith Waterhouse. At times, he was, in his own words, 'a
terrible prig'.
From Sheffield's council chamber, the young Hattersley ascended effortlessly
to Westminster, entering parliament as the first Wilson government took
office in 1964.
But though his sharpness was quickly spotted by the late Tony Crosland, he
failed to reach the Cabinet until Jim (now Lord) Callaghan appointed him
prices and consumer-protection secretary in 1976.
His critics at the time claimed that he failed to stand up for his
pro-European principles by resigning from Labour's front bench. They also
charged that he was opportunistic in backing the front-running Callaghan
leadership bid rather than for his old friends and allies, Roy (now Lord)
Jenkins and Crosland himself.
Such attacks fail, however, to take account of Hattersleian realism - the
same judgement that persuaded him not to take to the lifeboats when the
Social Democrat tide was running full flood.
A tribal man, Mr Hattersley's Labour loyalties are as fierce as his love of
Yorkshire and Coronation Street - sentiments as schmaltzy as a Hovis
advertisement, perhaps, but no less genuine for that.
In the long years of opposition, attitudes have subtly changed. His
hopelessly romantic bid for the leadership has been fully redeemed by his
loyalty to Mr Kinnock since. His less than shining period as shadow
chancellor - engaged in unappetising sumo wrestling with Mr Nigel Lawson -
was widely deemed a flop.
But in his current job as shadow home secretary, Mr Hattersley is regarded
to be enjoying a new lease of life. 'Roy is having a renaissance,' said one
colleague. 'He has discovered that the party likes him.'
Though by no means intimate either with the party leader or his shadow
cabinet colleagues, he is praised for a readiness both to consult and
devolve.
At times accused of spending more time on his books and journalism than his
political duties, Labour's growing band of constitutional reformers have
been impatient with his caution on a Charter of Rights and electoral reform.
Under pressure, however, he has appeared to be shifting, if at glacial
speed. Labour now argues that it will support a broad statement of rights,
to be backed up by individual legislative acts.
And while Mr Hattersley still opposes proportional representation for the
Commons, his even-handedness in allowing Professor Raymond Plant to conduct
his inquiry into electoral reform without interference has been noted.
So how would a Hattersley Home Office behave? The answer, if Labour's policy
menu is to be believed, is rather dramatically. With the party at best
expecting a narrow majority, its priority commitments to legislate for a
Scottish parliament in its first session and introduce a freedom of
information bill will put an often merely reactive dep+artment at centre
stage.
Close friends also claim that Mr Hattersley is deadly serious in his promise
to reform the House of Lords. Potentially, he could emerge as the last and
greatest reforming home secretary of the century - there can be no doubt he
is greedy for the job.
To his most unforgiving critics - the champions of Labour's new breed of
Browns and Blairs - it is his haughty aloofness and intellectual arrogance
are fatal flaws.
Yet there is a sense of humour, an all-roundedness to the man which is a
refreshing contrast to the grisly orthodoxies of the modern
technocrat-politician. His recent relentless hounding of the editors of the
Daily Express and the Daily Mail have added to the general jollity of
Westminster life.
On Star Chamber, the jokey C4 television programme that has 'personalities'
interviewed by a computer, Mr Hattersley was asked what animal best
described him. He replied: 'A Labrador dog. Because it's complacent,
affectionate and sometimes it actually sort of stands up on its feet and
resents people interfering with it.'
Unlike a well-known department store chain, Mr Hattersley is ever knowingly
undersold.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour reverses Tories' poll
advantage - Public Opinion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK, the Labour leader, is a step closer to becoming prime
minister, if the latest Financial Times compilation of opinion polls is an
accurate forecast of UK voting intentions.
The slim advantage for the Opposition party over the Tories would be
sufficient to deprive the Conservatives' of an overall majority in the
Commons. If Mr John Major resigned, Mr Kinnock could try forming a minority
government or agree a pact with the smaller parties at Westminster which
would hold the balance of power.
The latest weighted average, which takes account of the differing sample
sizes of the seven polls covered, puts support for Labour about half a
percentage point ahead of the Tories - almost reversing a similar lead the
Tories had in the survey last week.
If the results are transformed into numbers of MPs, the distribution of
support for the two main parties would still make the Conservatives the
largest party with 305 seats. Labour, however, would have only three seats
fewer. The Liberal Democrats would have 19, up one from last week.
Since last week's poll of polls Tory support has slipped by about one
percentage point while the Liberal Democrats have risen by about the same
amount. Labour's standing has remained at about 39 per cent. The survey,
however, highlights how evenly balanced support for the two main parties
remains, despite frenetic campaigning since the beginning of the year. The
difference between the two is well within the margin of error.
The only clear trend is a steady rise in support for the Liberal Democrat
party, although its standing is still not high enough to suggest its
parliamentary representation will stay as high as its current 22 MPs. Labour
at present has 230 Commons' seats and the Conservatives 367.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Walters joins criticism of income
tax cuts - Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, IVO DAWNAY and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of income tax cuts paid for from borrowing came under fire from
two opposing directions yesterday, as a leading free-market economist joined
Labour in warning that reductions would inevitably be followed by rises.
The Conservatives are confident that tax remains one of their strongest
cards, and yesterday again highlighted claims that both taxes and prices
would rise under Labour.
Sir Alan Walters, formerly Mrs Margaret Thatcher's economic adviser,
condemned as a 'fraud' Budget tax cuts paid for out of borrowing.
'A feel-good Budget may win the election for the Tories but the cost to
Britain will be substantial,' Sir Alan wrote in London's Evening Standard
yesterday.
'The Thatcher reforms will be further eroded as the government commands more
and more of people's savings in order to pursue the hare-brained ideas of
Heseltine and the social soporifics of Patten and his 'compassionate
Conservatives'.'
Sir Alan's attack follows a warning from Professor Patrick Minford, director
of the Liverpool Macro Economic Research department, at the weekend that the
UK's economic policy was paralysed by the exchange rate mechanism.
Labour returned to claims that a fourth-term Tory government would extend
value added tax to goods and services presently zero-rated or exempt which
they had not specifically pledged to protect: these included transport
fares, house purchases and postal services.
The Tories denied that they had any plans to switch the tax burden further
from earnings to spending than the shift implied by a basic income tax
target rate of 20 per cent with no corresponding reduction in indirect
taxes.
Mr Chris Patten, Tory party chairman, predicted higher taxes and prices
under a Labour government - the 'double whammy'. Labour's policies 'knocking
the economy for six' will be the theme of a Tory party political broadcast
on Thursday.
Yesterday the party cited a range of independent opinion to support its
case. The average of the forecasters' predictions was an interest-rate rise
of 2.5 per cent, and a fall in share values of 387 points.
Labour yesterday sought to counter suggestions that it is the 'anti-car'
party by publishing a charter for motorists aimed at giving better consumer
protection and improving road safety.
Transport spokesman John Prescott denied that an incoming Labour government
would axe the Department of Transport's Pounds 20bn roads programme to pay
for a substantial increase in expenditure on public transport.
The debate within the Conservative party over the Budget took another twist
yesterday with the publication of a report calling for radical reductions in
taxation, Philip Stephens writes.
The report, by the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward group, argues that
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, should abolish the current 40p top rate of
tax on March 10, cut the basic rate of tax by 1p and abolish or dramatically
reduce inheritance tax.
The paper also calls for longer-term action to reduce capital gains tax and
National Insurance. It argues that the government should meet its target of
a 20p basic rate of tax during the next parliament.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community agriculture and trade ministers yesterday renewed their
attempt to arrive at a common stance on the Uruguay Round world trade
negotiations, following failure of EC and US negotiators to make significant
headway on their differences over farm subsidy cuts last Friday.
The ministers were still in a closed meeting last night, and believed to be
still divided on what priority to give the numerous differences the EC has
with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) formula for
concluding the Round.
The EC is split into two main camps. The UK, France, Denmark, the
Netherlands and Belgium wanted to renegotiate the Gatt prescription that the
volume of subsidised farm exports be reduced by 24 per cent over the next
six years, in addition to a 36 per cent cut in export subsidies.
The others, a slight majority going into yesterday's meeting, emphasise
instead that compensation to farmers for subsidy cuts under both the Round
and EC farm reform should be included in the 'green box', for subsidies
which do not distort production and trade.
EC negotiators last Friday made some progress with the US on the 'green box'
issue, with the Americans seeking further clarification on the effect direct
compensation payments would have on production.
But the question of restraining export volumes 'is still untouched,' a
Commission official said.
The US is said by some officials to be seeking to take the matter to the
Group of Seven industrialised nations for resolution, and the US delegation
that was here last Friday is understood to have continued to Bonn.
Germany is the current president of the G7, and has openly mooted a special
summit to conclude the Uruguay Round.

trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday vetoed a bill that would have linked China's
tariff status to its good behaviour on human rights, trade and weapons
proliferation.
There is virtually no chance that Congressional leaders will muster the
two-thirds vote in both houses needed to override the president's veto.
Congress wanted to attach political conditions to China's enjoyment of Most
Favoured Nation (MFN) status governing the tariff levels on its goods sold
in the US.
These conditions would require China to show 'substantial progress' on human
rights, arm sales and trade policy before its MFN status could be renewed
again.
Although the House of Representatives passed the measure by 409-21 last
November, the Senate held off a vote, looking for a politically opportune
time to bring it forward.
Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader and one of the bill's strongest
backers, brought it up last week when Mr Bush was under attack from both
left and right in the presidential primaries.
Even so, the senator was unable to get the numbers he needed and the measure
passed by only 59-39.
In a message to Congress, Mr Bush said he approved of the aims of the
legislation, but disagreed with the method of achieving them.
'There is no doubt in my mind that if we present China's leaders with an
ultimatum on MFN, the result will be weakened ties to the West and further
repression,' he said.
In going ahead with his threatened veto, Mr Bush defied criticism by the
Democratic party's presidential candidates, who want US foreign policy to be
linked to human rights.
They are expected to try to use the issue against him in the November
presidential election by portraying him as a 'moral wimp', afraid of
standing up to China.
The issue will not be laid to rest. In May, the president must say once
again if he will renew China's MFN status in June.
Once again the Democrats, and many Republicans, can be expected to try to
place conditions on the renewal, using the opportunity for a further attack
on the president's foreign policy.

US steel companies are positioning themselves for the March 31 expiration of
the US 'voluntary' steel restraints (VRAs) if the date passes without a
multilateral agreement to lower trade barriers and limit government
intervention in the steel sector.
Speciality steel producers last week announced their support for a
three-year extension of the VRAs and threatened to file anti-dumping and
countervailing duty cases if their protection expires without a multilateral
agreement.
The producers, along with the United Steel Workers of America union, have
requested an early meeting with President George Bush. With speciality steel
concentrated in a few key electoral states, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana,
politics in this election year could bring the president to their point of
view, if a Multilateral Steel Accord (MSA) fails.
In a letter to Mr Bush, they said they represent the industry's high-value
and high-technology segment which must not be lost. 'Our products have
unique characteristics, which makes them critical to the economic and
industrial well-being of the US. There are few sectors in the industrial
economy that could function without speciality steels.'
The American Iron and Steel Institute, whose members produce three-quarters
of the United States's raw steel, have reaffirmed their support of a
'strong' multilateral agreement. It said the threat of subsidised and dumped
imported steel would be 'very real' without an agreement by March 31.
A working paper for an MSA, presented last week in talks with Japan, Canada
and the EC, prohibits the use of steel subsidies, except for a worker
adjustment programme, structural adjustment schemes in the case of permanent
plant closing, and environmental programmes.

architect, and BAA, the UK's main airport operator, for detailed design of
the passenger terminal and concourse complex of the colony's new HKDollars
46bn (Pounds 3.2bn) airport.
The HKDollars 536m contract is a two-year fixed price, lump sum order. The
predominantly UK group competed against seven other contenders.
The cost of the new airport led to debate in political circles yesterday.
One local politician claimed the PAA's decision to increase the distance
between the airport's two runways from 900 metres to 1,525m would cost an
extra HKDollars 10bn.
Mr Richard Allen, the authority's chief executive officer, said the distance
was the minimum between two runways to enable their independent operation.
Savings would be made on building costs because the island being created for
the airport would be 1,248 hectares in area, not 1,275 hectares as
previously planned.
Costs would be kept under constant review. If there were any overruns, the
consortium was contractually bound to redesign at its own expense to bring
them back into line.
The award of the contract coincided with the release of a master plan for
the new airport covering development up to 1997, 2010 and 2040.
By 1997, the airport should consist of one runway and two terminals and
handle 35m passengers a year.
Later phases of development include another runway and two more airport
terminals. Under the plan, by 2040 the airport will be able to handle 87m
passengers a year.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Mexico's growing intimacy with World Bank: The relationship
between the world development institution and its biggest customer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN President Carlos Salinas decided to overhaul Mexico's antiquated
agrarian laws, officials from the agriculture ministry called their friends
in the World Bank to ask them for advice.
The World Bank wrote issue papers; the Mexicans responded in kind. Draft
laws were written and re-written. Eventually a constitutional amendment was
drawn up, and passed late last year. The laws governing the new
constitutional article were passed last week.
Such intimate collaboration hardly raises an eyebrow in Mexico these days.
The World Bank has closely advised Mexico on most of its economic reforms in
the past decade - on trade opening in 1985, on the debt deal in 1989, and
now on education, agriculture and the environment.
In the last fiscal year, which ended June 30, the World Bank approved more
non-poverty loans for Mexico than any other country. Approvals totalled
Dollars 1.882bn, an impressive Dollars 927m more than Brazil, for instance.
World Bank involvement in Mexico came into its own in the mid-1980s, when
Mexico came to depend on World Bank money - its largest source of foreign
capital. From money followed advice. In 1985 Mr Fred Berger, then the bank's
chief Mexico economist, wrote a five-page memorandum that, according to one
bank official, 'had a substantial impact in helping them change their trade
policy'. Mexico soon afterwards announced it was going to join the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and received three tranches of Dollars 500m
trade adjustment loans to ease the pain.
But what happened afterwards explains why the Mexican state has become the
darling of the bank's economists (and its major shareholder, the US). Mexico
went much further in reducing its trade barriers than the bank required.
As in other policy areas, including agriculture, the World Bank influence
only came to bear because the Mexican government was itself convinced of the
need to press ahead with the reforms. Mr Rainer Steckhan, director of the
Mexico and Central America department at the bank, stresses 'It was a
home-grown programme; that was the secret'.
Working together, the World Bank-Mexico team has proved to be extremely
effective in achieving its goals. The 1989 debt deal - which, with hindsight
has clearly been crucial to Mexico's successful economic stabilisation - was
very much part of the Salinas plan. But the accord was facilitated by the
bank.
In June 1989, the bank - strongly supported by the US Treasury - approved
three loans for Dollars 500m each in record time. This (plus similar
International Monetary Fund loans) was designed to be a big show of support
for Mexico, says a bank official, and a warning to the commercial banks that
Mexico would be lent money even if it was in arrears in interest payments to
them. With a deal struck, the bank then put up Dollars 2bn in enhancements
to support the debt reduction. All along there was a lot of
behind-the-scenes advice between the bank staff and the Mexicans.
Since then the bank role in Mexico has changed, although it is no less
important. In June last year, it approved what should be its last adjustment
loan to Mexico, an agricultural sector loan of Dollars 400m. Such adjustment
loans are meant to encourage structural reform of the economy, or the reform
of specific economic sectors.
In future, World Bank money will be geared to broad-based project lending,
such as on primary education, drainage, irrigation, sanitation and so on.
'We have shifted emphasis,' says Mr Steckhan, 'in line with shifting Mexican
needs.'
The bank is now working with the government on how to support the
agricultural sector if, as is likely, barriers to maize imports are
eliminated as part of the the North American Free Trade Agreement. The bank
will target money - and advice - on improving the quality of land through
irrigation, while simultaneously offering income supports to the hardest-hit
farmers.
The World Bank's role in the reflecting both changes in priorities in both
Mexico and the bank, and has not been without friction. Mexico City's
environmental planning office complains about the mountains of paperwork the
bank requires before going ahead with a loan. The bank in turn would like
the government to use more market-based mechanisms - such as taxes on
pollution - in its effort to clean the city's air.
Nevertheless, the bank is at the point of approving a loan of up to Dollars
200m to help Mexico City clean up its air, money which will partly fund
lead-free gas, new buses and taxies, and more technical studies.
The Mexican government is understandably sensitive to accusations that it is
marching to World Bank running orders. Mr Angel Gurria, Mexico's
under-secretary of finance, readily concedes the bank economists can be
influential, but only because they are able technicians, often 'the best
people in the world'. As he says: 'If you are convinced you are doing the
right thing, often they will tell you how to do it better'.
But he says: 'It is not credible that the World Bank forces the Mexican
government to do anything'. As Mr Gurria points out, the bank only has the
capacity to make between seven and 10 Mexican loans a year, while Mr Gurria
can think of scores of projects the bank would like to finance. So if the
bank turns down one project because it does not like government policy in
that area, Mr Gurria will just offer another project, and so on, until the
target Dollars 2bn of loans is used up.
A more significant reason is that the bank does not need to force Mexico to
do anything; the two sides agree on almost everything. Mr Gurria says that
World Bank economists and Mexican officials often spend weekends together
brainstorming on policy issues. Many are the graduates of the same US
universities, and friends.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Environment pledge by Heseltine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN
Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is prepared to speed up its programme to reduce emissions of carbon
dioxide, provided other countries do likewise, Mr Michael Heseltine, UK
environment secretary, said in New York last night.
Addressing the international preparatory conference for the Earth Summit in
Rio de Janeiro in June, he said the UK was prepared to give more to the
Global Environment Facility, run by the World Bank, to help developing
countries tackle their environmental problems. In the past year Britain has
given it Pounds 40m.
Mr Heseltine announced that Britain was considering stabilising carbon
dioxide at 1990 levels earlier than its existing target year of 2005. Carbon
dioxide is the main greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming.
The European Community target is to stabilise these emissions by the year
2000 and Britain has been criticised as the only member country to have a
later target date.
Mr Heseltine's undertaking was conditional on non-EC countries speeding up
their efforts. In particular, he wants the US to set national targets for
greenhouse gas emissions.
Michael Littlejohns, UN correspondent, adds: Mr Heseltine later took issue
with an estimate by Mr Maurice Strong, conference secretary general, that
developing countries needed at least Dollars 125bn a year in foreign aid -
Dollars 55bn above the present level - to carry out environment programmes.
Calling this unrealistic, Mr Heseltine said: 'I would not dream of providing
a figure of that sort at this stage of the negotiations.'

<TEXT>
MR JAMES BAKER, the US secretary of state, intervened personally to support
the granting of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 570m) of US government loan guarantees
to Baghdad after he received complaints during an October 1989 meeting with
Mr Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister.
In the Washington meeting, Mr Aziz demanded the Dollars 1bn of guarantees
and complained to Mr Baker that the US handling of the scandal over improper
Iraqi loans from the Atlanta, Georgia branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro (BNL) was making Iraq 'very unhappy'.
The disclosure, made yesterday in a congressional statement by Mr Henry
Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee, seems likely to further
fuel controversy over the role played by Bush administration officials in
assisting the financing of Iraq in the months leading up to the August 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
Declassified US government documents released by Mr Gonzalez show that at
the time of the Baker-Aziz meeting, the US Treasury and Federal Reserve
already suspected BNL Atlanta of providing loans to Iraq that helped Mr
Saddam Hussein to finance his development of nuclear, chemical and ballistic
weapons projects.
Mr Gonzalez also released documents showing that Mr Baker swiftly contacted
other cabinet members to argue for the Dollars 1bn of Iraqi loan guarantees,
while Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, lobbied the
Treasury and Office of Management and Budget.
Approval for the Dollars 1bn of further US loan guarantees was given in
November 1989.

THE Reagan administration's director of Central Intelligence, the late Mr

a month after the general visited Cuba to meet President Fidel Castro.
The hitherto unreported meeting was acknowledged by Mr Donald Winters, CIA
station chief in Panama from June 1984 until the summer of 1986, testifying
yesterday for the defence in Gen Noriega's drug trafficking trial in Miami.
Mr Winters said yesterday the CIA had 'encouraged and appreciated' the
assistance of Gen Noriega, particularly in passing on information about Cuba
and President Castro. His testimony forms part of the defence effort to
portray the general as a US ally.
Mr Noriega's meeting with Mr Casey was one of at least four with CIA
officials held immediately before and after his overnight visit to Havana on
July 5 1984.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Jakarta's push for growth is postponed: Emerging problems
for Indonesia's economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE BOLDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO YEARS ago, Indonesians referred to 'the take-off era' as being a matter
of fact and only months away. But a rapid push towards a developed economy
has become a more distant ambition as the country tackles reality.
After tremendous growth and economic liberalisation, Indonesia faces
long-term problems that are products of its size, diversity and ethnic
composition and other short-term ones derived largely from the speed of its
economic success.
It is also entering an uncertain time as it awaits a decision from President
Suharto, who is 70 years old and has been in office for 25 years, on whether
he will stand for a further five-year term next year. There is every
indication that he will.
Whether he stays or goes, the government, with one eye on developments in
eastern Europe, knows that pressures for change to the rigid and
authoritarian political system are likely to grow.
The military, which has been the president's principal power base and has
had a guaranteed role in political decision making, the government
administration and the economy, is having to face the fact that it is not
ideally equipped to hold such a position in the modern, industrialised
nation that Indonesia is striving to become.
Mr Jusuf Wanandi, who heads the Jakarta based Centre for Strategic and
International Studies, says: 'In a modern society the armed forces' role has
to change. You can't be the best artillery man in town and the best
politician.'
Political certainty has been important to Indonesia in its drive for foreign
investment and aid since the late 1960s. General elections in June, though
billed locally as 'the feast of democracy', are unlikely to provide any
upset. Golkar, the part political party-part bureaucratic organisation which
is in effect a government election machine, will win, though possibly not
with quite as much as the 73 per cent of the vote it received five years
ago.
Questions about Indonesia's political future are mounting just as its
leaders are beginning to confront economic realities.
The remarkable success in diversifying the Indonesian economy after oil
prices crashed in the mid-1980s has prepared the ground for a modern
export-led economy, but it has also created new pressures and drawn
attention to obstacles.
After big increases in foreign investment and imports just as non-oil
exports growth was slowing, the World Bank said in its annual report on
Indonesia last year, 'developments during 1990 demonstrate how aggregate
demand pressures could build up and generate balance of payments
difficulties and inflationary pressures.'
Inflation in 1991 was nearly 10 per cent and the current account deficit
rose to over Dollars 5bn, almost double the previous year's figure. A tight
money policy sent interest rates soaring, contributing to a rapid fall of
the fledgling stock market.
Infrastructure problems, most particularly the lack of electric power on the
main industrialised island of Java, have become increasingly acute.
Indonesia has Dollars 70bn in foreign debt. The World Bank said sustained
growth will require 'continued high levels of financial support from the
donor community'.
Indonesia's technocrat managers are aware that they have to act to get
things under control and some difficult decisions have been made. Last
October, about Dollars 80bn worth of planned infrastructural and
petrochemical projects were cancelled because of concerns about the amount
of foreign borrowing that would be needed to finance them.
The 1992-93 budget announced earlier this year also sought to bring the
economy into line and contained no pre-election give-aways. On the contrary,
taxes and tax collection are to be enhanced in an effort to promote greater
self-reliance. Foreign borrowing will be cut by 8 per cent, fuel subsidies
will be abolished and the real increase in spending is to be kept to a
modest 3 per cent.
The more intractable long-term problems, however, are difficult to address.
The government has the constant headache of finding jobs for the more than
2m people who enter the workforce every year and, more significantly, of
educating and training them in skills needed in an industrial economy.
Technical training is poor and good quality managers are hard to find.
As a result, Indonesia attracts investors in labour intensive industries
such as textiles and footwear where wages are low and where the workforce
can contribute little in terms of purchasing power.
Indonesia's geography also presents problems. In Jakarta, the growing number
of glittering office blocks reflect Indonesia's new economic sophistication.
But more than 2,000 miles away in the province of Irian Jaya, naked
tribespeople wander the rugged mountains barely ekeing out a living.
Bringing those people and others scattered in isolation around the huge
archipelago into the development process is a daunting task.
Telecommunications, transport and electricity links are poor to non-existent
in some provinces. The heavily centralised political system means decision
making is slow and regional needs are often misunderstood.
Dr Doradjatun Kuntjoro Jakti, an economist at the University of Indonesia,
says there is a need to use tax and trade incentives to create special areas
for development in places such as Irian. 'We should give them special status
to capitalise on the rise of the Pacific era' he says.
Disparities in wealth are not only regional. The growing 'social gap'
between the new rich and the poor is a cause for concern most particularly
because it fuels existing ethnic tensions. Most of Indonesia's big business
conglomerates are owned by members of the small ethnic Chinese community and
resentment of their wealth among indigenous or pribumi Indonesians runs
high.
The Chinese are well aware of that and of the fact that when an attempted
communist coup triggered a wave of bloody vengeance in 1965 their race was
singled out for attack. The temptation to deposit their wealth outside
Indonesia is therefore difficult to resist.

<TEXT>
'YES] Ja] South Africa': President F W de Klerk, who set off yesterday on a
two week whistle-stop tour of the white South Africa has clearly decided to
keep his message simple in campaigning for the country's referendum. He has
little choice.
For President de Klerk has precious little good news to sell to white
voters, who will decide two weeks from today whether to abandon the
privileges of centuries in favour of multiracial democracy, or revive the
fantasy of apartheid by voting no to political reform.
His manner is polished and professional; with an easy smile and a twinkle in
his eye, he charmed the Afrikaner youth of Stellenbosch yesterday, as he
strolled through the university campus and lunched at the canteen.
But charm is not enough to make his message palatable - even in
Stellenbosch, the seat of Afrikaner learning and home of verligte
(enlightened) Afrikanerdom.
Repeatedly, Mr de Klerk promised voters on his day-long tour of the western
Cape that his government would guarantee justice, stability, security and
economic development - and crucially, that he would prevent blacks from
dominating whites in a mirror image of apartheid. Many want to believe him;
but most - at least in this region - will vote yes whether they believe him
or not. The alternative is simply too frightening.
For the strength of Mr de Klerk's campaign lies in conjuring up apocalyptic
visions of a no vote in the referendum: this would bring the pro-apartheid
Conservative Party to power, plunge South Africa into international
isolation, probably provoke race war and destroy the already-weak economy.
Weekend newspaper adverts said it bluntly: Vote no and turn South Africa
into Lebanon.
Mr de Klerk adopts a high moral tone in his public meeting; at Stellenbosch
town hall, he spoke of justice for all South Africans, of a civilised
society where citizens of all races can live as one nation. He appealed to
the voters of Stellenbosch not to reject the 26m South Africans who are not
white. He sketched a vision of a country enriched by its ethnic and racial
diversity.
But he spent at least half his address answering the main thrust of the
Conservative party campaign to date: red-baiting. He denied that his party
has entered into a de facto alliance with the African National Congress,
which is itself closely allied to the South African Communist party.
That message went down relatively well in Stellenbosch, which one adviser
described as 'tame country for F W'. But it could well prove otherwise when
Mr de Klerk takes his roadshow to more dangerous turf: the working-class
suburbs of Johannesburg, the ultra-conservative Orange Free State; the
northern Transvaal, home of Mr Andries Treurnicht, the Conservative leader,
as the campaign finale.
For South Africans certainly want to end their international isolation -
South Africa's participation in the current cricket world cup has proved
wildly popular at home, even if the national team has lost its last two
matches. They want sanctions to end and international lending to resume. But
it is a moot point whether they really want the 'one nation, one South
Africa' which F W de Klerk promises. Whatever his assurances to the
contrary, many fear domination by blacks and the loss of economic privileges
built up under apartheid. Two weeks is a very short time to persuade them
otherwise.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Saudi ruler faces up to change: A look at an historic
development for the kingdom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE the physical infrastructures of the oil-rich monarchies of the Gulf
have been transformed in the past three decades, their political
institutions have been notably resistant to change, and nowhere more so than
Saudi Arabia.
The announcement on Sunday by King Fahd of several decrees, including the
formation of a Consultative Council, therefore marks what is for the kingdom
an historic development, even if for the western world it may appear to be
little more than a cosmetic change.
There is nothing new in the idea of a consultative council. King Fahd first
mooted the proposal ten years ago on his accession to the throne. However
its introduction has been spurred by the pressures on the kingdom caused by
the Gulf war.
The war accelerated trends already visible in the Saudi economy and in its
political life. It is these that King Fahd is now seeking to answer.
Saudi Arabia is still a wealthy country but much less so than it was. Gross
domestic product last year was only two-thirds of the level in 1981. It has
run a budget deficit for each of the past ten years, and in 1991 borrowed
abroad for the first time.
Although oil income increased sharply in 1991, as output topped 8m barrels a
day to compensate for the drop in supplies from Kuwait, revenues are still
well below the level of the early 1980s.
With foreign currency reserves available to the government standing at less
than Dollars 10bn, there is little room for economic manoeuvring. In other
words, Saudi Arabia has acquired many of the characteristics of other world
economies and will require more sophisticated management.
However, there remains one substantial difference. The ruling family in
Saudi Arabia feels obliged to provide virtually all public services free of
charge. Modest attempts at finding alternative sources of revenue have
failed to win public support and the government has recoiled from the risk
of unpopularity. Some local economists argue that the nettle will have to be
grasped before too long, especially if the defence establishment's appetite
for more sophisticated weaponry is not curbed.
A consultative council with the power to suggest new laws would obviously be
a convenient vehicle through which potentially divisive measures could be
introduced.
The council also has the potential to answer wider political demands. Saudi
Arabia's fast-growing population is being far better educated, and is
frustrated by the incompetence, waste and sometimes corruption at official
level. At the same time, the interests of the religious right, the natural
political enemy of the liberals, have been broadened. Both challenged the
ruling family in after the Kuwait invasion.
The most obvious symbol of the liberal challenge came from 45 women who
drove cars through the centre of Riyadh in defiance of the law.
Taking advantage of such a large western presence in the kingdom, including
hundreds of journalists, they hoped to shame the government in allowing
greater freedoms. Not only did they fail in their attempt but they also
stirred up the religious right who were furious at this attempt to undermine
their own perceived authority on social issues.
One of the main anxieties of the religious establishment has been that the
consultative council would be the structure used by the liberals to gain
political advantage. Faithful to his extremely cautious nature, King Fahd
has delayed for at least six months the naming of the 60 members of the
council, thus rendering impossible any attempt at assessing its political
complexion. However it can be assumed that it will be an exercise in
political balance.
This same principle is also extended to the ruling families. In a further
decree announced on Sunday King Fahd has to an extent formalised the method
of nominating future monarchs The process will remain very much within the
family, but it does appear to answer the criticisms of some members who
feared they were being ignored.
Political evolution in Saudi Arabia is under way but the pace of likely
development can best be measured against the enormity of events required to
get it started.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Iraqis to put case before UN delegates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN Iraqi delegation led by Mr Tariq Aziz, the country's deputy
prime-minister will come to New York next week to speak to the UN Security
Council on March 11 about scrapping Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction,
UN diplomats said yesterday.
The Security Council said last week Baghdad had less than two weeks to
explain its position and comply with ceasefire accords mandating the
scrapping of all weapons of mass destruction.
President Saddam Hussein would otherwise face undetermined 'serious
consequences,' the council said.
British officials said the meeting would show Iraq that anger at its
prevarication over the UN resolutions is shared across the 15-member council
and 'that it's not just the case that the whole show is being run by the US,
backed by Britain and France'.
Iraqi is expected to argue that the economic embargo against Baghdad should
be lifted in parallel with compliance with the UN resolutions. The Security
Council will insist, however, that the embargo must remain in force until
Iraq has complied in full with its orders.
In Baghdad, Mr Aziz said Iraq had pursued the 'objective, accurate
implementation of (UN) measures'.
He said he would tell the council Iraq would approve if the UN aimed to
implement Resolution 687. 'But if your objective is to annihilate Iraqi
industry and deny Iraq the chance of becoming a prosperous industrial
country, that would be a different matter.'

RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree yesterday that supports the
restoration of a German autonomous republic on the Volga river, Russian
television said, Reuter reports from Moscow.
'The document draws attention to the necessity of urgent measures to
rehabilitate and, step by step, to restore the statehood of Russian Germans
inside the Russian Federation,' the television said.
Soviet leader Josef Stalin accused the Volga Germans, descendants of workers
brought to Russia by Tsar Peter the Great and Empress Catherine the Great in
the 18th century, of collaborating with invading Nazi troops in 1941.
All were deported to Siberia and Central Asia, and now more than 800,000
ethnic Germans are scattered across Russia. The decree suggests the first
step is to set up a German national district in the Volgograd and Saratov
regions.
Mr Yeltsin promised to restore the German republic when he visited Germany
last year.
President Yeltsin will start a two-week working holiday in the Black Sea
resort of Sochi,his press secretary said.

The former Soviet army prepared yesterday to withdraw a rifle regiment
caught up in the crossfire between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, Reuter reports.
A military convoy entered Stepanakert, the enclave's capital, to help in the
pullout of the 366th rifle regiment, which cousuffered three dead in recent
fighting. The pullout could usher in a new stage in the four-year conflict.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Russia seeks bigger role in IMF
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
RUSSIA, promising further radical economic reforms, served notice yesterday
that it would fight for a much bigger role in the International Monetary
Fund than the West is prepared to give it.
Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky, responsible for negotiations with international
organisations, said Russia was seeking a quota of 4 to 4.2 per cent of the
IMF's capital. The size of the quota determines the amount of Fund resources
available to individual members.
The Group of Seven leading industrial nations, whose influence is key in IMF
decision-making, are proposing a 4.5 per cent quota for all former Soviet
republics, including 2 to 2.5 per cent for Russia. Before a proposed IMF
capital increase, this would rank Russia in 11th place, sandwiched between
the Netherlands and China. The IMF expects its experts to agree with the G7
figures for Russia.
But Mr Kagalovsky, whose country is also seeking a seat on the IMF board,
said that such calculations were 'erroneous' because they were based on
working out a quota for the former Soviet Union and then dividing it among
the 15 republics.
One compromise solution would be for the Fund to promise Russia a greater
share of IMF funds in return for a lower ranking. The issue is delicate
because national pride means that Russia, as heir to the former Soviet
superpower, sees itself as closer to the US and Germany than to the
Netherlands.
The quota will be one of the main issues in membershp negotiations between
now and April 27, when Russia and the other republics are expected to
receive the green light for joining the Fund. Russia will be using as a
bargaining chip its bold programme of economic reforms for 1992, which
follows IMF recommendations to the letter.
The main points of the programme are as follows:
The removal of price controls on most goods and services by end of March
except for rents, transport and services, domestic use of gas and
electricity
The freeing by April 20 of the domestic price of oil to reach an estimated
Rbs2,000-2,500 (Dollars 19.6-Dollars 24.5) a tonne (compared with Rbs350);
this will be accompanied by a 50 per cent tax on domestic sales, presumably
to be paid by the seller. Mr Kagalovsky said he expected domestic energy
consumption to fall by 10-15 per cent after the price liberalisation. The
government aims to slow inflation to 1-3 per cent by the end of the year
after an expected jump in prices overall of 50-75 per cent in April
Reduction of the budget deficit to one per cent of GNP by the end of this
year (according to Mr Kagalovsky) to be achieved mainly through a cut in
subsidies to enterprises and military spending
Restoration of value added tax of 28 per cent on all types of goods
(following its removal from certain food sales) and its introduction for
imports from July 1 1992
A unified regime of export taxes for energy and raw materials
Introduction in mid-summer of system of one fixed exchange rate for the
rouble for all current transactions, plus one rate for capital movements.
One western embassy recently calculated that there were at least 10 exchange
rates in force in Russia at the moment
Further tightening of the central bank's monetary-credit policy including an
increase in reserve requirements for commercial banks to 20 per cent in
April
Progressive tax on pay rises by state enterprises which exceed set norms
more focused social subsidies for the worst off and the unemployed
Mr Kagalovsky warned that the scope of the programme would have to be cut
back if Moscow failed to receive sustantial foreign financial assistance.
He said this should include a stabilisation fund of Dollars 5bn-Dollars 6bn
(Pounds 2.86bn-Pounds 3.34bn) which is being put together by individual
western states, not by the IMF, for the rouble, and further debt relief to
free resources for social welfare, stabilisation funds, and increased
imports.
Britain has agreed to help Russia become a member of the International
Monetary Fund, marking a further step forward in economic cooperation
between the two countries, writes Peter Norman.
Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, announced yesterday that Britain would
represent Russia's interests during the IMF's consideration of its
membership application.
The move follows a request for British help from Mr Yegor Gaidar, the
Russian finance minister.
Russia's application will be discussed soon by a committee of the IMF board
of directors, which will also consider details such as the size of Russia's
membership quota in the fund. Russia will make an initial presentation of
its case to the committee and then leave Britain to argue the Russian case
in detail. It is normal procedure for an applicant to appoint an existing
IMF member to act on its behalf in this way.
Britain's goal is to secure Russia's membership of the IMF at the next
meeting of the fund's policy-making interim committee at the end of April.
Mr Lamont, the UK chancellor, said he was 'delighted' that Mr Gaidar asked
Britain to represent Russia.

<TEXT>
THREE people were shot dead yesterday as animosity between Moldova's
Romanian-speaking majority and ethnic Russians flared into violence again,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
Moldova's Interior Ministry said the head of a local Russian-speaking
militia was among those killed in a shoot-out with police near a textile
mill in Dubossary, in the breakaway Dnestr republic proclaimed by
Russian-speakers.
The town was the scene of fighting between police and the militia last
December in which at least five people died.
The Moldovan government, which promotes closer ties with neighbouring
Romania, refuses to recognise the region's secession. It said the incident
was contrived by 'the leaders of Dnestr's separatist forces backed by
reactionary forces' to undermine Moldova's UN application.
Tension has run high for the past two years between ethnic Romanians and
Russian-speakers who fear they will be overwhelmed if Moldova, a member of
the new Commonwealth of Independent States, tightens its links with Romania.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Brussels urged to be patient over IMF aid to CIS states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC foreign ministers yesterday told Brussels to be patient in letting the
International Monetary Fund take the lead in organising macro-economic aid
to former Soviet republics.
But the ministers broadly endorsed the call by Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC
external affairs commissioner, for the Community to extend EC ties to all
members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) - in Asia as well as
in Europe - and to relax conditions which have so far blocked the Ecus
1.25bn (Pounds 887m) food aid loan to the CIS.
Mr Andriessen, fresh from touring four CIS republics last week, told
ministers that the EC should show the world a lead in stabilising the
longer-term economic future of the CIS. Specifically, the EC should widen
the scope of the aid-to-CIS conference which it will chair in Lisbon in May
to deal with structural, not just emergency, aid.
Some Commission officials feel that the IMF will provide too little, too
late to prevent further economic and political de-stabilisation in key CIS
republics, and therefore it was up to Brussels to mobilise a wider aid
effort of the kind that the US-sponsored Washington conference in January
has so far failed to generate.
But Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said most ministers felt
macro-economic aid should be left to the IMF, which is due to admit CIS
republics as full members next month. 'The enemy here is confusion,' said Mr
Hurd. 'In the CIS there are too few institutions, while we have too many,'
he said.
The EC should not get in the way of the IMF which was far advanced in its
work with the leaders of, at least, Russia, he claimed.
After visiting Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan as well as Belarus and Ukraine last
week, Mr Andriessen told ministers that Central Asia and Kazakhstan 'are so
inter-dependent with the other former Soviet republics that they will stand
or fall together.'
Thus, Brussels should not be seen to demote central Asian reublics to second
place, behind European CIS republics, but should negotiate trade and
co-operation deals with all.
One possible way of tying central Asian states to secular Turkey, rather
than fundamentalist Iran, Mr Andriessen suggested, was for the EC to lend
them money to buy goods from Turkey, in the same sort of triangular trade
operation that Brussels is conducting in Eastern Europe.
Pleading for the EC not to let its food aid get caught up in red tape, Mr
Andriessen said the Community should be ready to waive some of the
guarantees it has been demanding for its Ecus 1.25bn food loan. The
Commissioner suggested that if Ukraine and Russia could agree on a 20/80 per
cent split of responsibility for repayment of past Soviet debt, the EC
should accept this.
The Commissioner got wide backing from foreign ministers. But any change in
the loan terms will have to be agreed by their more stoney-hearted
colleagues, the finance ministers, when they meet in two weeks' time.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Bowater to pay Pounds 444m for two packaging companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWATER, the UK printing, packaging and industrial films group, is to buy
two specialist packaging companies for Pounds 444m. The purchases of DRG
Packaging and Cope Allman Packaging would be financed mainly through a
Pounds 333.5m rights issue, Bowater said yesterday.
The move will strengthen Bowater's position in the medical and
pharmaceuticals packaging sector and expand its business in mainland Europe.
Mr David Lyon, Bowater chief executive, said the opportunity to buy both
businesses had arisen because of their over-extended financial position. The
companies had been the subject of acquisitions, funded by high levels of
debt, in the late-1980s.
'If we had not gone through a recession of this depth then we do not believe
that these businesses would have become available. They would have gone for
public flotations,' he said.
Bowater's acquisitions may signal the start of a series of similar deals as
companies which took on substantial debts to fund leveraged deals during the
bull market era of the 1980s seek to escape their financial constraints.
DRG, which will be bought for Pounds 212m, was the subject of a
controversial takeover bid in 1989 when Mr Roland Franklin, the corporate
raider and one-time associate of Sir James Goldsmith, paid Pounds 697m for
the Bristol-based packaging group.
The Pembridge Investments takeover vehicle has subsequently sold most of the
assets it acquired for Pounds 622m. The company yesterday accepted that the
acquisition had not been a great success for its backers.
Cope Allman, which will be bought for Pounds 232m, was formerly run by
Quoteplan, which is 49 per cent owned by ADT, the security and car auction
business run by Mr Michael Ashcroft. Quoteplan paid Pounds 210m for Cope
Allman in 1988 but quickly encountered tough trading conditions as recession
hit both sides of the Atlantic.
Mr Lyon said he believed the recession would continue to produce more
acquisition prospects for Bowater.
'There will be some businesses that will remain weakened and there may be
the opportunity for some add-on acquisitions that we can sensibly make. We
want to have enough headroom to spend another Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m on
acquisitions,' he said.
Bowater's 1-for-3 rights issue is priced at 605p, against yesterday's
closing share price of 765p, down 3p. The issue has been fully underwritten
by Morgan Grenfell. The broker is Hoare Govett.
The UK-based Bowater demerged its US operations in 1984. They are run as a
separate business, Bowater Inc.

FT  03 MAR 92 / EC faces long battle over budget increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers yesterday prepared for a protracted
wrangle over the Commission's plans to increase Community revenue by nearly
a third over the next five years.
The 1993-97 finance package is causing deep unease among richer member
states, in particular Germany and the UK, the two largest net contributors,
which have balked at such an increase.
But foreign ministers kept their powder dry when Mr Jacques Delors, the
Commission president, gave a spirited defence of the finance package, which
calls for an increase in the budget from Ecu66.6bn (Pounds 47bn) now to
Ecu87.5bn in 1997, at 1992 prices.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, foreign minister of Portugal which currently holds
the EC presidency, produced snorts of disbelief among member states'
diplomats when he described reaction to the package as 'indubitably very
encouraging'.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, who was the most openly sceptical
about the plan, said: 'People are reserving their fire,'
Member states stand to pay significantly more under the plan, and their
ministers used the closed meeting to map out a negotiating timetable. This
looks set to run well into the UK presidency in the second half of this
year.
The budget increase is designed to accommodate the greater spending on
regional aid, and to help Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland prepare for
monetary union, agreed among the 'cohesion' aims at Maastricht summit in
December.
The rest is to finance farm reform, the EC's growing foreign policy
commitments, and a sharpened research effort to strengthen industry.
Mr Hurd reiterated Britain's contention that the EC can get two-thirds of
the increase Brussels is seeking without raising the revenue ceiling.
He added that farm spending should fall, not rise; that no figure was agreed
at Maastricht on funding the four poorest countries; and that the increased
research and training effort amounted to sanction for the Commission
'picking winners' in industry.
Mr Delors rejoined by saying that, while the plan was not 'the bill for
Maastricht', he had understood the summit to have agreed that 'cohesion was
one of the supporting pillars of the Community'.
He appealed for members not to sink to what he called 'budgetary guerrilla
warfare,' telling journalists afterwards: 'We are building a Community, not
a financial clearing house.'
According to a senior Spanish official, Mr Delors told ministers that, if
they wished to cut, they should look at fiscal transfers to the southern
countries last.
Farm reform, he said, needed short-term headroom to finance long-term
change.
He again maintained that spending on improving industrial competitiveness
and on Community foreign policy was money the individual member states would
have to pay out anyway.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Price of houses shows fresh fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES fell sharply again last month, according to Nationwide Building
Society.
The fall in prices is likely to dispel remaining government hopes that an
upturn in the housing market might encourage a greater feeling of well-being
among voters before the general election.
Nationwide, the UK's second-largest building society, says the average price
of a home has fallen by 4.1 per cent in the past 12 months, from Pounds
57,661 to Pounds 55,308. Prices have fallen by 3.5 per cent since November
after a brief rally in the autumn. In February, prices fell 1.2 per cent
after a drop of 1.1 per cent in January and 1.2 per cent in December.
The new figures coincide with claims from the Association of London
Authorities that more than two-thirds of Londoners who were first-time
buyers in 1988 are now saddled with mortgages above the value of their
homes. In five boroughs - Croydon, Newham, Waltham Forest, Tower Hamlets,
and Barking &amp; Dagenham - more than four-fifths of 1988 buyers are now in
this position, the association says.
However, Mr Peter Munday, Nationwide's business development director, said
there had been a rise in interest from potential purchasers since the
beginning of this year. But this was taking time to work through to firm
sales.
The government announced plans at the end of last year to waive stamp duty
on house sales of up to Pounds 250,000 and introduced measures to stem the
number of homes repossessed from borrowers unable to meet mortgage
repayments.
Mr Munday said the moves would help to rebuild flagging confidence. But 'the
key to the return of long-term stability in the housing market lies in a
general improvement in the economy, greater confidence in employment
prospects and the removal of election uncertainty,' he said.
Estate agents and housebuilders have recently reported a big rise in visits
to houses for sale. However, many expect activity to subside during the
election campaign when public attention is likely concentrate on the
shortcomings of the economy. In a survey by the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors last month, agents reported that higher interest by
would-be purchasers had failed to translate into higher sales.
Housebuilders, which have been cutting prices heavily to generate a
much-needed cashflow from higher sales, appear to have been more successful
in promoting purchases. But most stress that confidence among potential
purchasers remains fragile.
In spite of the lack of confidence, many people still believe that buying
their home is a good investment, according to a survey by Alliance &amp;
Leicester Building Society.
The society says 92 per cent of those planning to buy a house this year
thought it would be a good investment.

FT  03 MAR 92 / MPs hit at City over pensions regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITY'S system of self-regulation over pension funds will bear the brunt
of fierce criticism by a cross-party Commons committee next week over its
failure to prevent the disappearance of several hundred millions of pounds
from companies controlled by the late Robert Maxwell.
In particular, the Select Committee on Social Security is expected to single
out the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro) for allowing Mr
Maxwell to control a fund management company that gave him personal access
to his employees' pension funds.
The MPs are expected to recommend radical changes in UK pension law. They
may possibly call for pensions to be run by trustees employed by independent
companies unrelated to the employer, rather than the present system where
employers often select trustees.
MPs contend that, in its testimony to the committee, Imro had failed to
persuade them that it had exercised good judgment in authorising Mr
Maxwell's companies to operate as fund managers or that it had supervised
them properly.
The comments come as Imro's latest report to its members reveal that 66
members - roughly 5 per cent of the total - are under investigation because
investors' money may be at risk.
Maxwell company pensioners have targeted Imro's failure to spot the Maxwell
abuses in a fresh campaign to win compensation from the government. The
Maxwell Communication Pension Plan Consultative Committee is urging all
members to write to their local MPs citing Imro's decision to authorise Mr
Maxwell's Bishopsgate Investment Management as a 'fit and proper body'.
The report will also criticise some City bodies, particularly actuarial
firms, for failing to take sufficient responsibility over the affair.
The Commons committee's report had been scheduled for publication on
Thursday but the volume of additions sought by MPs and the time spent
yesterday debating its broad thrust has forced a delay until Monday.
The committee, which will meet again tomorrow, is hoping to make its
conclusions more powerful by agreeing as much as possible without dissent
among members.
The pensions industry, shaken by the revelations about the Maxwell affair,
is supporting calls by politicians for reform.
The National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF), the industry's largest
trade association, has called for changes in the composition of boards of
trustees and changes in rules over custodianship.
During weeks of testimony, actuaries, accountants, lawyers and former
pension fund trustees told the committee that they did not know the true
state of the pension funds' finances or their investment policies. They also
said they had no responsibility for investigating further.
The Institutional Fund Managers Association, the trade association
representing those who invest pension funds, has endorsed the NAPF
proposals.
The Institute and Faculty of Actuaries last week called for a review of
pension law, saying that the current trust law governing pension funds may
no longer be sufficient.
Mr Roy Brimblecombe of Clay and Partners and chairman of the institute,
said: 'One of the problems with trust law is its absence of teeth.'
MPs on the committee have yet to decide whether the role played by banks in
some of the share transactions involved was sufficiently culpable to merit a
wider attack on the City. The committee is also understood to be considering
calling for a compensation scheme for pensioners.
In addition, the committee will report to the Commons on the failure of Mr
Ian Maxwell and his brother Kevin to reply to a questionnaire sent by the
committee to the pension trustees.

FT  03 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Early losses reduced in late trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UK stock market depressed initially by weakness in the pharmaceutical
sector was rallying steadily at the close as the dollar improved in the wake
of the latest data on the US economy. Trading volume was thin for most of
the session, although business in the blue chip internationals increased
after Wall Street opened.
Investment sentiment remained cautious ahead of the UK budget, due a week
today. UK public opinion polls continued to overshadow the stock market,
with the latest polls suggesting a weakening in public ratings of Mr John
Major, the UK prime minister.
London share prices fell sharply at first as traders took on board the
implications of two unexpected fund raising operations in the equity market.
Plans by the Wellcome Foundation to reduce its stake in the quoted drug
company from 73.6 per cent to under 50 per cent had been widely foreshadowed
in the UK press at the weekend. But confirmation by the trustees indicated
an international share placing on a very substantial scale - a minimum of
Pounds 2.5bn at current share prices.
Also disclosed yesterday morning were plans by Bowater for a Pounds 333.5m
rights issue in London. UK traders had been assuming that there would be no
significant cash calls ahead of the UK budget which is due a week today. The
stock market dipped by 20 FT-SE points in early trading but was then rescued
by a firm opening in the stock index futures, which later, however, lost
support.
The first hour of market trading, traditionally the most active of the day,
brought only miniscule business, however; the Seaq total did not reach 1m
shares until mid-morning.
In these slack conditions, a temporary widening in the premium on the FT-SE
March futures contract and a trading programme involving stocks across the
full market range reduced the loss in the Footsie. However, the market
remained on the downside throughout the day and it was not until the US
dollar responded favourably to the latest survey of opinion among US
Purchasing Managers that London established a convincing rally.
At its final reading of 2,554.3, the FT-SE Index was only 7.8 off. Boosted
by demand for Reuters and some other international stocks after Wall Street
opened with an early gain of six points on the Dow, volume in London
improved in the second half of the session. The Seaq network finally
recorded trading of 438.6m shares, against 449.7m on Friday, when retail
business was worth Pounds 962.8m.
However, traders said that there was little direction in the market as a
whole. Wellcome's news brought a heavy fall in the shares which represented
a fall of three points on the Footsie. Some other pharmaceutical issues,
also significant constituents of leading market indices, were unsettled by
the prospect that cash might be raised in order to meet the Wellcome
placings. However, the sector rallied well at the close.
Overall views of the stock market remained little changed. A relatively
generous budget speech is expected, together with a cut in UK base rates.
However, the market is held back by uncertainty over the outcome of the
general election. This was again reflected yesterday in losses in the water
industry stocks, considered to be at risk should a Labour government be
elected.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS of the proposed placing of a sizeable chunk of Wellcome shares in the
market cast a shadow over trading in stock index futures, writes Joel
Kibazo.
March went into retreat shortly after its opening at 2,567 and was pushed
lower by a big seller around 10am, causing the contract to fall to 2,556.
Buyers, mainly looking for protection against further falls in the
pharmaceutical sector, were however seen at the lower levels helping steady
trading in the index.
Dealers concentrated on spread trading in the early to mid-afternoon before
a big buyer of a 150 lots triggered a squeeze late in the session sending
March forward.
A firm firm opening on Wall Street was also said to have helped the advance.
March closed at 2,569 around 11 points above its estimated fair value
premium to cash of around 6 points. Turnover was a poor 4,686.
In traded options, turnover improved to reach 29,978 contracts, with the
FT-SE 100 index option accounting for 10,778 lots.
Midland Bank was the busiest stock option. It traded 1,536 lots, followed by
Hanson with 1,339 lots dealt. British Gas, Wellcome and Lonrho were also
busy.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Appointments: Eyeing Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
From burgers to eyewear? Richard Snead, until now managing director of
Burger King in the UK, was also pretty sceptical when the US Shoe
Corporation approached him to head up one-hour optical retailer
Lens-Crafters' British operation.
'I wasn't about to leave a very promising career at Burger King to mind
eight stores (the extent of the current network in Britain),' says Snead, an
American who has spent 13 1/2 years at the burger retailer now owned by
Grand Met, and who, since 1989, has been in England masterminding among
other things the integration of Wimpy into the Burger King chain.
But his family likes living in the UK, and Snead, 40, was won over by the
notion of being 'a key player' in advancing the LensCrafters concept
internationally. With a little sensitivity to the differences of the UK
marketplace, he thinks the optician's success in the US can indeed be
replicated across the Atlantic, and also has his eye on continental Europe
once the UK is mastered. And, for the cv, the coming of the single European
market means that 'this is the most exciting place for a businessman to be.'
His predecessor, Angus McPhie, who opened the first shops in the UK in 1990,
returns to parent company US Shoe in America.

FT  03 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters in ADR flurry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LATE surge in shares of Reuters, the global data information group,
followed news that US investment houses are currently running heavy short
positions totalling 2.74m American Depository Receipts (ADRs). Such a
situation in the ADR market implies an underlying short position of around
8.2m Reuters shares.
Barrons, the US investment magazine, published a list of the 10 heaviest
short market positions among US brokers which included Reuters. After being
marginally easier for much of the London session, the stock began to push
ahead as Wall Street opened yesterday.
US brokers were among those chasing the stock higher in late trading in the
UK, attempting to close what are seen as dangerously exposed share
positions. The stock ended a busy session 26 higher at 1197p, its best level
since mid-July 1990; turnover reached just short of 1m shares.
Specialists said the shares were also being stimulated by high hopes for
Reuters' Dealing 2000 foreign exchange trading system which is expected to
go 'live' later this month. The group's Globex system is about to undergo
trials.
Wellcome setback
Concern over the the proposed dilution of Wellcome shares saw the
pharmaceutical group tumble in turnover of 4.1m. Wellcome Foundation, the
charitable trust, yesterday confirmed weekend reports that it intends to
seek permission to sell at least 24 per cent of the drugs group in an
international placing - leaving the trust with a stake of under 50 per cent.
It said its long-term aim was to maintain a share of 25 per cent of the
equity.
'Wellcome has always benefited from the premium attached to the rarity of
the shares available for trading,' said Mr Didier Cowling at Nomura. 'The
proposed reduction of that premium has taken the top off the shares, but
also hit the rest of the sector on concerns that there could be switching
into Wellcome.'
Worries over greater liquidity in Wellcome dragged the pharmaceutical sector
down in early trading. However, strong US buying pulled selected stocks back
in busy afternoon trading, with Glaxo Holdings rising 4 to 785p, and
SmithKline Beecham 'A' shares adding 5 to 923p.
Bowater rights
The market was taken completely by surprise by a hefty Pounds 333m rights
issue from Bowater to help fund a brace of acquisitions for more than Pounds
400m. The cash-call and purchases accompanied near-static profits and a near
9 per cent hike in the final dividend.
Dealers, taken aback by the magnitude of the rights issue, chopped the
Bowater share price to 744p as the news emerged. But it later rallied
strongly, eventually closing only 3 easier at 765p, with specialists
enthusiastic about the acquisitions, DRG Packaging and Cope Allman
Packaging.
Bowater's manoeuvring gave a substantial boost to ADT, the security alarms
group which held a minority stake in Quoteplan, which in turn owns Cope
Allman Packaging. ADT will receive Pounds 117m. ADT shares, which fell to a
five-year low of 281p as recently as December last year, jumped 37 to 500p
on the news.
Fisons firmer
Shares in Fisons rose ahead of today's results, buoyed by renewed bid
speculation and market sentiment that the stock is undervalued. Without a
chief executive and with the shares looking fairly cheap, weekend press
speculation was carried over into the market yesterday that either ICI or
Hanson - both old favoured candidates - could be possible predators. The
shares added 7 to 393p.
A mixture of US and Japanese buying, via Goldman Sachs and Nomura, sustained
the English power generators, but water stocks suffered from selling
generated by the latest opinion polls and profit-taking after their recent
good performances . Of the footsie stocks Anglian and Severn Trent weakened
8 to 363p and 338p, North West 7 to 372p and Thames 6 to 376p.
Nomura was said to have been responsible for downward pressure on GEC,
seeing an early improvement to 217p whittled away to settle slightly easier
at 215 1/2 p. Downgrading the shares from a 'hold' to a 'sell', Nomura's
Miles Saltiel said GEC shares had run ahead of themselves and outperformed
the market by 23 per cent since last July, reducing the yield premium from
46 per cent to 21 per cent. He said the stock had benefited from a stream of
new contracts which he did not expect to continue.
Hopes of a big boost to sales of its telephone alarm systems for the elderly
and disabled saw Tunstall shares run up 10 to 220p.
Midland Bank outpaced the rest of the banks sector. The shares climbed 11 to
278p responding to talk of broker upgradings, recovery hopes and lingering
takeover speculation. Turnover in the shares was a hefty 6.5m. Lloyds also
made good progress, adding 7 at 420p.
The battle between brokers in the UK and the US to get the upper hand in BP
continued yesterday with 15m shares changing hands. Most UK investment
houses have been aggressive sellers of BP since it revealed disappointing
preliminary figures last month, as opposed to US investment banks which have
been heavy buyers of the shares. The stock was 4 down when Wall Street
opened but subsequently rallied to end the session unchanged on balance at
266p.
British Aerospace continued to shine following last week's two-day analysts'
visit to the company. The shares gained another 9 to 325p with 4.2m shares
traded.
Kwit-Fit gained 6 to 192p after Albert E. Sharp, the Midlands stockbroker,
said that profits would rise to Pounds 32m and the dividend by 22 per cent;
Ford's move into its business sector was 'unlikely to impact significantly'
on Kwik-Fit said Sharp.
ASW Holdings retreated 7 to 131 after reporting a 94 per cent profit setback
to Pounds 2.3m. Mr Robert Sassoon at County NatWest believes the company
will be forced to cut the interim dividend. Because of the 'slow improvement
in the pricing environment'. Sentiment in ASW left British Steel half a
penny off at 71 1/2 .
News of accountancy practice worries at MTM cast a shadow over Siebe, the
shares falling 15 to 579p. The company is said to follow similar policies.
Press reports that P&amp;O had won a Pounds 1bn contract to build the second
phase of the Disney theme park outside Paris lifted the shares 2 to 368p.
Chemicals group MTM plunged 60 1/2 to 226p after it announced that its 1991
results would be delayed by three weeks over the auditors valuation of
certain fixed assets. MTM warned that its profits - expected to be in the
region of Pounds 23m - would be 'substantially below current City
expectations'.
Entertainment group European Leisure slipped 2 to 5p as it warned of
continuing difficulties in its trading performance.
Speculation rose that Thorn EMI had emerged as favourite to buy Virgin's
music division. The shares slipped 2 to 807p.
Preliminary talks have taken place with potential purchasers of all or a
major part of Dalepak, according to the company. This lifted the shares 71
to 433p.
Food retailer Ashley Group, jumped 8 to 50p as the resignation of Mr Anthony
Butler as chief executive encouraged speculation about a consortium bid for
the company. Suggestions of a possible price war, involving the big
supermarkets, knocked 5 off J. Sainsbury and Tesco to 387p and 265p
respectively. A research document from Goldman Sachs warned that the
introduction of US style warehouse clubs into Britain, with heavy
discounting on bulk purchases, poses a potential competitive threat to food
retailers.
Do-it-yourself store owners took a hammering on fears of a price war
following a series of press adverts offering a sharp reduction in prices.
Boots' fall of 7 to 472p was a reflection of the depressed pharmaceutical
sector rather than its position as a major retailer.
The first day of trading in Rosebys saw shares in the household textiles
retailer finish at 124p, compared with the placing price of 115p.

FT  03 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Political decisions influence
Brussels and Milan bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICS upset Milan but lifted Brussels yesterday, while holidays kept
senior bourses quiet, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN was dealt a serious blow by President Francesco Cossiga's refusal to
sign a bill to liberalise car insurance premiums. The Comit index fell 3.63
to 532.40.
Analysts said that the bill was now unlikely to become law ahead of the
general election in April or, because of its unpopularity, to be taken up
again by the next government. In any case, the EC is expected to force Italy
to liberalise its car insurance market in 1994.
They added that Mr Cossiga had shattered the only real investment theme in
the Italian stock market. The one glimmer of hope was that the authorities
would compensate the insurers with an above-inflation rise in car insurance
premiums this year.
There was widespread selling of insurers, which had been expected to see a
turnround in profits as a result of the reform. Sai and Lloyd Adriatico,
both heavily exposed to the car insurance market, fell L400 and L290
respectively to L13,400 and L15,410. But Generali, which fell L260 to
L30,690 at the fixing, improved slightly after hours.
In banks, Santo Spirito and Banco di Roma continued to weaken after last
week's share exchange news. Indifferent 1991 results also weighed on the
sector.
BRUSSELS rose to a two-year high on weekend news that Belgium's mainstream
political parties had reached an accord on forming a new government.
Cyclical shares were particularly favoured as the Bel-20 Index rose 18.66 to
1,229.21 in turnover of BFr1.5bn.
In the insurance sector, Groupe AG rose BFr90 to BFr2,200 and Royale Belge
picked up BFr140 to BFr4,570, on speculation that they would both merge with
banks.
FRANKFURT had a quiet day as carnival closed Dusseldorf and turnover dropped
from DM6bn to DM3.5bn. The DAX index closed 2.74 higher at 1,747.87 after a
decline of 0.46 to 709.29 in the FAZ at midsession.
Volkswagen, depressed in 1991, closed DM6.50 higher at DM368.10, up 28 per
cent from its 1992 low. Allianz, the insurer, strong recently after deeply
discounted rights issue terms, put on another DM20 to DM2,420.
Among second-liners, Rutgerswerke, the chemicals group, dropped DM20 to
DM400 on profit-taking after a 29 per cent rise in the previous four weeks.
PARIS had a quiet day, the CAC-40 index ending 3.71 down at 1,979.67 after
trading in a 13-point range. Turnover was thin at FFr1.5bn, reflecting
school holidays. Leading blue chips were largely unchanged, but there was
some activity in smaller stocks.
A block of 150,000 shares in TF1 was put through the market at FFr380 and
there were rumours that the sellers were the Maxwell group or GMF, an
insurance company.
But rumours that the buyer was Bouygues were dismissed by analysts because
the construction company was limited to its 25 per cent stake.
TF1 closed down FFr11 at FFr379 in total volume of 155,687 shares. The
television company is known to have an unstable shareholding structure and
analysts expect the fight for control to resurface.
AMSTERDAM closed slightly lower in dull trade. The CBS Tendency Index
slipped back 0.4 to 126.2. Buhrmann Tetterode fell 90 cents to Fl 43.10
before its results, which came out after the close, showed a 25 per cent
fall in net profits. The paper and office equipment group also said that the
dividend would be cut.
Fokker, which announced on Friday that it was paying its first dividend for
five years, rose 30 cents to Fl 32.00. Heineken, which reports 1991 results
on Thursday, fell Fl 1.20 in early trading but recovered to close down 10
cents at Fl 168.80.
OSLO corrected last week's fall and the all-share index closed up 6.60 or
1.6 per cent to close at 418.91 in turnover of NKr252.5m. Norsk Hydro gained
NKr4 to NKr141.5 while Saga Petroleum A rose NKr0.50 to Nkr71.50. Den Norske
Bank, which was suspended for three hours on Friday, rose NKr0.90 to
NKr7.30.
COPENHAGEN's CSE index slipped 2.19 to 345.34 in relatively lively trading,
writes Hilary Barnes. Speculation that Mr Poul Schluter, prime minister
since 1982, may be forced to resign later this year reinforced the market's
negative mood.
Investors took unkindly to Carlsberg's rights issue, although it was priced
at a deeply-discounted DKr200, the B shares falling by DKr22 to DKr318
yesterday.
STOCKHOLM said that high liquidity among institutional investors, falling
Swedish interest rates and strong foreign interest were behind a rise in the
Affarsvarlden General index of 9.5 to 950.9.
Volvo B rose SKr4 to SKr382, and Procordia restricted A by SKr7 to SKr200.
The rise followed a newspaper report saying that Volvo and the Swedish state
might each sell their 42.7 per cent voting stakes in Procordia.
MADRID was overshadowed by results from Telefonica which reported a 33 per
cent increase in 1991 net profits. However, unease over the group's
short-term prospects depressed the stock which closed down Pta30 or 2.5 per
cent at Pta1,1175. The general index fell 0.15 to 266.36.

FT  03 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: HK at record high after difficult
period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG came back to lead the world last week, after a period of edginess
and some profit-taking in mid-February. Its best day was last Thursday when
the Hang Seng index rose by 2.1 per cent, but on Friday it closed higher
again to leave the index at yet another record high.
Thursday's gain came on better-than-expected results for Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank's Australian subsidiary and the failure of the US Senate to
pass, by a two-third majority, a law seeking to apply conditions to China's
Most Favoured Nation trading status.
But brokers and analysts say that a more relaxed attitude to the US dollar
by international investors has been important for the market. Because Hong
Kong dollars are freely convertible for US dollars at a fixed rate, the
local market offers investors access to what are effectively US assets.
Domestic brokers say that buying interest was broadly based on Thursday.
Local, mainland Chinese, European and US investors were all in the market.
Particularly aggressive were mainland Chinese investors who have not been
seen to be active for a long time.
In London, Mr David Bates of Asia Equity has seen a strong trend of US
institutional buying last week, indicating a large switch of US money into
Hong Kong.
The 'atmospherics' surrounding the Hong Kong market appear to many in the
market to be propitious. The southern Chinese economy is growing rapidly and
that is to the benefit of a lot of Hong Kong companies which have
investments there.
On a more fundamental basis, analysts are expecting earnings growth for Hong
Kong companies of between 16 and 18 per cent this year. To many the market
still appears to be undervalued.
The Asia Pacific region also took in the worst performer in the FT-Actuaries
World Index series last week, namely Singapore. Mr Bates says that there has
been a switch from Singapore to Malaysia and Hong Kong over a period;
meanwhile, last week saw a budget categorised as a non-event. 'Corporation
tax was cut by a percentage point,' he adds, 'but people thought that the
package would be a lot more generous.'
The major equity markets made a restrained, but positive showing last week
and the World Index reflects this with a rise of 0.6 per cent, Europe
leading other regions with a 1.1 per cent increase.
Spain came out top in Europe following record midweek highs on Wall Street,
and the cut in the Bank of Spain's intervention rate by 25 basis points.
Mr Stephen Hughes at Nikko Europe in London, says that Madrid's most recent
rally has been based mainly on the strong performance of a limited number of
blue chips. He notes that the banking sector has underperformed
significantly, and that a short-term consolidation will be necessary before
the market pushes on again.

FT  03 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Drug stocks rise again
on individual buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUED STRENGTH in drug-related stocks, on the back of buying by
individual investors, pushed the Nikkei average up yesterday, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed up 149.01 at 21,487.82. After falling to the
day's low of 21,342.62 immediately after the opening, the index reached the
day's high of 21,550.86 during the morning session on arbitrage-related
buying.
Volume edged up to 200m shares from 180m. Advances led declines by 564 to
370 with 182 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
rose 6.58 to 1,561.07 and in London trading, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost
1.45 to 1,192.76.
The drug sector was the largest gainer of the day, rising 4.04 per cent,
followed by mining and food. The market focused on Aids-related issues,
which traders dubbed as 'dream stocks', unaffected by the slowing economy
and sluggish company earnings.
'It is the first thematic activity of this year, and indicates that
investors have started to take a cautious interest,' said Mr Nick Cant at
Baring Securities.
Reports that the major securities houses - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi
 -were going to support the market by setting up investment trusts for
institutional investors failed to boost the market.
A business daily reported that companies, which cannot hold their own
shares, would be able to buy their own stock through the funds. However, the
brokerages later denied such plans.
The market is waiting for Friday's publication of the Bank of Japan's
quarterly survey of business sentiment. Market participants had hoped that
publication would coincide with a cut in the discount rate. But recent
pressure by leading politicians to ease monetary policy is likely to have
caused the Bank of Japan, which is keen to protect its independence, to dig
in its heels.
Kaken Pharmaceutical was the most active issue of the day, rising Y10 to
Y1,490. Mochida Pharmaceutical gained by its daily limit of Y450 to Y3,770.
The issue did not trade until the final 20 minutes due to the lack of
sellers.
By contrast, the air transportation sector was the largest loser, falling
2.3 per cent. Japan Airlines fell Y24 to Y852 on last Friday's projections
of a pre-tax loss for the current year. All Nippon Airways fell Y40 to
Y1,180.
Nichiboshin, a non-bank financial institution, fell Y47 to Y485 on concerns
about its bad loans to real estate companies.
Electronics issues fell on light foreign selling. Hitachi lost Y5 to Y835
and Sony retreated Y10 to Y4,070.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 193.49 to 23,149.06 in volume of 53.7m
shares. The index rose above 23,000 for the first time in 12 trading days as
investors sought drug-related issues.
Roundup
THE RISE in Toyko helped lift part of the Pacific Rim.
HONG KONG ended off the day's highs as profit-taking and news of a rights
issue eroded initial gains. The Hang Seng index added more than 50 points
shortly after the opening but closed up 23.13 at 4,952.19. Turnover eased to
HKDollars 3.02bn from HKDollars 4.06bn.
Jardine International Motor Holdings fell 45 cents at HKDollars 5.70 after
news that it hoped to raise Dollars 56.3m through a one-for-four rights
issue.
SEOUL staged a technical rebound in response to last week's loss. The
composite index, which hit a high of 626.73 before profit-taking emerged,
ended 8.15 higher at 620.65 on a turnover of Won292.9bn after Won194.3bn on
Saturday.
SINGAPORE fell as investors took stock of Friday's budget in which the
government forecast slower earnings growth this year.
The Straits Times Industrial index closed down 16.93 or 1.14 per cent at
1,460.50 in volume of 48.5m shares.
KUALA LUMPUR closed broadly lower in cautious trading. The composite index
fell 3.13 to 601.93.
BANGKOK's SET index closed down 3.75 at 779.10 in turnover of Bt7.36bn.
Bangkok Bank shed Bt56 to Bt632 on profit-taking while Bangkok Land gained
Bt10 to Bt216.
JAKARTA eased 0.56 to 280.43 in volume of 4.2m shares against 5.65m. Inco,
the nickel producer, fell Rp50 to Rp3,550.
TAIWAN's weighted index gained 1.95 to 5,144.37 in turnover of TDollars 39bn
against TDollars 37bn. Investors remained cautious ahead of constitutional
reforms due to be implemented soon.
MANILA was further depressed by a fall in Philippine Long Distance Telephone
in New York on Friday. The composite index ended down 11.84 at 1,171.83.
AUSTRALIA rose in quiet trading and the All Ordinaries index closed up 11.3
at 1,625.4 in turnover of ADollars 169m. Coles Myer gained 18 cents to
ADollars 11.66 while News Corp put on 26 cents to ADollars 17.40. BHP rose
two cents to ADollars 13.64.
NEW ZEALAND was lead higher by active overseas interest in Telecom which
rose 8 cents to NZDollars 2.54. The NZSE-40 index gained 7.52 to 1,500.73.
BOMBAY's BSE index soared a record 315.57 or 10.5 per cent to a new high of
3,333.25, boosted by Saturday's budget. The budget scrapped wealth tax on
share investments, allowed foreign pension funds to buy stocks directly, cut
import and excise duties and made the rupee partially convertible. The
exchange authorities also lifted a ban on forward dealings in shares,
imposed in January to curb excess speculation. This allowed freer market
operation, brokers said.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rises on strong figures
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR recovered strongly after subdued trading as unexpectedly robust
economic data helped revive market optimism over the US economy.
The closely-followed National Association of Purchasing Management index
showed a surprising increase to 52.4 for February, its highest since October
1991, and well above both market expectations and the January figure of
47.4. This coincided with a 1.3 per cent rise in construction spending for
January, compared with the 0.6 per cent predicted.
'The markets had been positioning themselves for a number below 50 on the
NAPM index,' said Mr Peter Luxton, senior economist at Barclays. 'Today's
figure is seen as an important indicator and could point towards a recovery
in the second quarter.'
The dollar had earlier tested downside support towards DM1.63, as the market
anticipated some mixed data ahead of Friday's crucial employment report. It
had, however, gained some strength from the disclosure by US treasury
under-secretary Mr David Mulford that the yen had been discussed at the
meeting of G7 deputy finance ministers at the end of last week, but that no
decision had been taken on correcting its weakness.
The dollar rose to close at DM1.6450/60 from DM1.6443/50 before the data
were released and a DM1.6400/10 start. In Tokyo, it had closed at DM1.6427
after quiet trading within very narrow bands.
Gains on the yen were, however, restricted as speculation continued about
heavy sell orders around the Y130.00 mark. The dollar closed up slightly at
Y129.70/75, after a Y129.50/60 start. It had ended in Tokyo at Y129.58/62.
The D-mark lost ground against most main currencies after the rise in the
dollar, but made small gains against the Swiss franc despite statements from
the Swiss National Bank that it was still concerned about the currency's
recent losses.
The peseta remained well below its EMS ceiling, although it recovered
slightly to 5.88 per cent above its pivot against sterling, compared with
5.77 per cent on Friday.
Its softness against the D-mark dropped sterling's floor in the EMS below
DM2.87, from above DM2.88 last week, and the market has taken the
opportunity to push sterling gradually lower, although it has remained above
the very bottom. Most traders, however, have discounted the idea that this
could provide room for an imminent UK rate cut.
Sterling moved little, drawing no encouragement from weekend opinion polls
putting the opposition Labour party slightly ahead, or the still gloomy
economic outlook.
It finished slightly up at DM2.8799, having opened at DM2.8778, although it
dropped as far as DM2.8734 at one stage. It closed down against the dollar
at Dollars 1.7507, from an opening of Dollars 1.7580, although it briefly
topped Dollars 1.76 just before the US economic data were released.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Trading still slow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY market rates remained little changed after a quiet day's trading
caused by continuing political nervousness.
There was, however, no repeat of the liquidity problems seen on Friday.
While the overnight market had been uneasy at the outset, with early
estimates putting the shortage for the day at Pounds 1bn, money soon
cheapened as the market moved quickly to sell out the gap.
The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of around Pounds 900m, and
took out much of this as it purchased bills worth Pounds 800m for resale to
the market on March 23 at 10 7/16 per cent.
At midday, the shortage was revised to around Pounds 1bn, and the Bank
compensated by purchasing Pounds 130m of band 1 bank bills and Pounds 70m of
band 2 bills, both at 10 3/8 per cent.
When the forecast was revised upwards again to Pounds 1.15bn, the Bank
bought a further Pounds 120m of band 1 bank bills and Pounds 10m of band 2
bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. It provided late assistance of Pounds 60m.
As a result, overnight rates, which had earlier topped 11 per cent, first
eased to 10-9 3/4 per cent, and later dropped as far as 5 per cent late in
the day, before lifting to close around 9-8 3/4 per cent.
Period rates, meanwhile, showed little change is expected in the basic
market situation before the Budget on March 10. Most traders had already
decided there would be no base rate cut until then, and some now believe
there may be no cut before the general election.
The key three-month interbank rate was unchanged at 10 3/8 -10 1/4 per cent.
The March short sterling contract dropped six points to 89.72.
German call money rates remained at 9.55/65 per cent despite a sharp rise in
reserves. Traders said the liquidity that had left the market on Wednesday
for pension payments largely flowed back on Thursday, but the market was
uncertain about the timing of employee wage payments.
In the US, the Federal Reserve injected reserves into the system through
overnight repurchase agreements. The federal funds rate came under pressure
from the settlement of two- and five-year note auctions, with funds trading
at 4 5/16 per cent at the Fed's operations time, above the presumed 4 per
cent target.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bank points to farm upheaval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RADICAL changes sweeping UK farming have been highlighted by a report
which estimates that more than 9,000 farms have gone out of production in
the last five years.
Most of the 1.4m hectares released has been swallowed up by other farms,
according to the report by National Westminster Bank. The average UK farm is
now 152 ha and has increased by 41 ha since 1987.
The bank compiled its figures from questionnaires returned by 26,000 farmers
who work more than 20 per cent of the UK's farmland.
It believes that there will continue to be considerable concentration in the
industry as the largest farms expand and the smallest ones shrink.
Farmers under the age of 45 showed the greatest tendency to expand, and also
the greatest move towards diversification, which the agriculture ministry
has urged on the industry in the face of sharply falling farm incomes.
More than half of all farms had diversified, with more than a third
favouring contracting for other farmers. Second most popular diversification
was the provision of holiday accommodation, followed by horse livery.
The agriculture ministry is also urging farmers to co-operate in marketing.
The bank survey found that while 16 per cent of arable and root crop
enterprises are involved in co-operative marketing, only 12 per cent of
livestock farmers are similarly involved.
The larger the farmer, the more likely he is to be involved in co-operative
marketing, said Mr Brian Montgomery, senior executive of the bank's
agricultural office.
The report suggests that there will be a 'missing generation' in the
industry as nearly half the farmers questioned did not name a successor.
'Overall, a picture emerges of an industry in flux. Bedevilled by
uncertainty but, with the right level of encouragement, poised to make the
necessary structural and attitudinal changes,' the report concludes.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Eurobanana poses threat to Gatt
talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROBANANA is threatening to emerge as the agricultural commodity which
puts the definitive skids under the already very shaky Uruguay Round world
trade talks.
On Wednesday, the European Commission will attempt to decide whether to make
bananas grown in the Community's outlying territories and former colonies
subject to growing competition from much cheaper bananas from Central and
South America.
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is supervising the five
year-old Uruguay Round, requires all farm products to have import tariffs,
which would then be reduced during the next six years if a deal on trade
liberalisation is reached by the Easter deadline Gatt has set.
The EC has not set a tariff for the so-called 'dollar bananas'. The
Community limits the entry of these predominantly Central American and
Colombian bananas, and in addition charges a 20 per cent quota on them
except in Germany. That is to protect high cost producers in the West
Indies, and overseas territories like Guadeloupe and Martinique belonging to
France, or Spain's Canary Islands.
The Commission - and the Council of Ministers (of the 12) - is divided
between those who want a derogation, or temporary exemption, from the Gatt
rules, and those who want to set a very high tariff on dollar bananas, to
allow protected banana producers time to adjust. The tariff advocates are
calling for a duty of Ecu353 per tonne - the difference between the highest
import price from EC banana zones and the lowest import price from the
dollar zone in 1986-88 - on top of the standard 20 per cent duty.
So far, however, only about one third of the 17-strong Commission appears
ready to agree. France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece seem certain to
oppose the proposal.
Of the 3.3m tonnes of bananas the EC consumed in 1990, 2m tonnes came from
the dollar zone, with the rest split evenly between EC output and imports
from former colonies. Two of every three bananas eaten in the UK come from
the Windward Islands.
The EC faces a genuine conflict of obligations. Under a banana protocol to
the Lome convention through which the Community assists mainly African and
Caribbean countries, it has treaty obligations to preserve the advantages
enjoyed by their banana exports. It is also obliged by next year to
introduce a single market in the fruit under the '1992 programme'.

Gold market jitters yesterday followed the Indian government's weekend
Budget statement which announced its intention to tap that country's huge
private gold holdings, dealers said.
Middle East selling sent gold down to Dollars 349.75 a troy ounce in London
yesterday morning. It recovered later to Dollars 350.85, down Dollars 2.35
an ounce from Friday's close.
Mr Andy Smith, analyst with Union Bank of Switzerland, said that the
proposals, ie. to lift a ban on gold imports and allow Indians living or
travelling abroad to import 5 kg of gold, were likely to hit the Bombay
premium for smuggled gold.
The situation was reminiscent of 1990 when gold prices plunged Dollars 23 an
ounce on Middle Eastern selling within seven days of that year's Indian
budget.  That removed controls on the internal market and swiftly sent local
prices down 10 per cent.
About 200 tonnes of gold are smuggled into India each year to avoid import
restrictions, mainly through Dubai. Mr Smith said that, while in the longer
term India's budget proposals were an incentive to buy gold, in the short
term many Middle East suppliers faced reduced margins on their Indian sales
and might be tempted to sell.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Asarco completes mine expansion
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASARCO, one of the world's leading producers of non-ferrous metals, has
completed a Dollars 224m (Pounds 128m) expansion of its Ray mine in Arizona
ahead of schedule. The expansion raises Ray's annual copper output by 58 per
cent, to 182,000 short tons (2000 lb).
Asarco has also achieved its strategic goal of moving from being a custom
copper smelter to become a fully integrated copper producer. The company
will be self-sufficient in copper concentrates this year and even have a
small excess, according to chairman Mr Richard Osborne.
Asarco mines will produce 285,000 tons of copper in concentrates in 1992 and
its smelters are scheduled to use about 262,000 tons. However, the excess
will probably be needed at the company's Hayden smelter, which has been
running at record rates since last August.
In 1985 Asarco provided only 25 per cent of its concentrate requirements
from its own resources. A 30,000-tonnes-a-day mill at Ray will be brought
into full production in a few months.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pasminco sets deadline for
European assets sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PASMINCO, the Australian lead-zinc group, expected to sell its European
assets - put up for sale last week - in six months, said Mr Peter Barnett,
managing director, yesterday. The assets include Pasminco's smelter at
Avonmouth - the sole domestic source of zinc in the UK - and 50 per cent of
the Budelco smelter in the Netherlands.
Several companies had already indicated an interest, he said after talking
to analysts in London. Mr Barnett later left for Helsinki to talk with
Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish group.
He will then fly on to Japan because Mitsui and Sumitomo have expressed an
interest. Metallgesellschaft, the German group, also wanted details.
Mr Barnett said the European assets would not necessarily be sold as a
package. However, Pasminco's three companies at Bloxwich in the UK West
Midlands, which make a number of zinc alloy products, would be sold with the
Avonmouth smelter because their operations, which employ about 850 in total,
were tightly linked.
Analysts said that Pasminco should easily find a buyer for the Avonmouth
smelter, which recently completed a Pounds 10m programme to expand its
annual capacity to 105,000 tonnes of zinc and 50,000 tonnes of lead bullion.
However, there were doubts about the 200,000-tonnes-a-year zinc smelter at
Budel in the Netherlands.
Budelco, jointly owned by Billiton, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group,
will run out of storage capacity for jarosite, an iron-bearing waste product
from electrolytic smelting, in 1995. The Dutch authorities want proposals
for the future of the smelter this year.
The partners have said they are willing to contribute F310m (about Pounds
100m) towards necessary environmental changes.
Mr Barnett said the partners had discarded as uneconomic a scheme to
reprocess the jarosite into an inert slag for building material. They were
now looking at a project to treat the jarosite with other waste materials,
such as water sludges, from the locality at a new waste treatment plant.
There were still technical and economic issues to be resolved.
One option was to close the Budel smelter, which employs 600. But 'closure
would be a great pity because it is one of the most efficient zinc smelters
in the world,' Mr Barnett insists. Potential buyers might 'look on this as
an opportunity to invest in a world-class smelter and a new waste treatment
plant.'
Avonmouth's performance had improved in two years and both smelters were
well located for the European market.
The sale would enable Pasminco to reduce its debt and to focus its attention
on its Australian operations.

FT  03 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Philippine bank defers GDR
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE state-controlled Philippine National Bank (PNB) yesterday deferred a
plan to issue global depository receipts (GDRs) for foreign investors.
Instead, it announced a 2.27bn pesos public offering of 10 per cent of its
outstanding capital, or 8.03m shares, under the government's continuing
privatisation programme.
The offering, which will reduce the government's holding in the bank to 57
per cent, is set for a March 16-27 roadshow. The shares will be listed on
the local stock exchanges on March 30.
Mr Edgardo Espiritu, president of PNB, the country's largest commercial
bank, said the proposed GDR offering had been deferred until after the
national elections in May, or 'until perceptions by foreign investors
regarding Philippine stock issues improve.
'We feel it more advantageous to concentrate on the local market for the
time being,' Mr Espiritu said.
The GDR issue, which was to have been sold in Europe, the US and Japan, was
expected to represent about 10 to 11 per cent of the bank's outstanding
shares. At present, foreign ownership in PNB stands at about 15 to 17 per
cent, according to Mr Espiritu. Philippine laws limit foreign holdings in
local commercial banks to 30 per cent.
The public offering follows the successful sale on January 27 of 67 per cent
of Philippine Airlines, the national carrier, to a group of prominent local
business groups.
It is part of a privatisation programme launched in 1987 by the government
of President Corazon Aquino. The programme has proceeded at a pace much
slower than earlier expected.
A feature of the PNB offering is a so-called 'greenshoe option'. A first in
the local capital markets, the greenshoe option allows the underwriters to
compensate for any variance in the offering's price, to be announced only at
the end of the offer period, and the market price to which the underwriters
are committed.
The underwriting syndicate, composed of member-firms of the Investment
Houses Association of the Philippines plus universal banks that do not own
investment houses, may buy additional shares at the offer price from PNB or
at market prices from the stock exchanges to offset any big variance, PNB
officers said.
PNB is setting aside up to 15 per cent of the offer for underwriters who may
avail of the greenshoe option. A similar volume is also being allocated for
existing shareholders.
Including these latter allocations, the total public offering is expected to
amount to 13 per cent of outstanding capital, or about 10.4m shares, bank
officers estimate.
PNB recently reported 1991 net profits of 4.02bn pesos, an increase of 21
per cent over the previous year. Gross revenues rose 29 per cent to 13.8bn
pesos.
PNB shares, which have a book value of 146 pesos each, currently trade on
the local stock exchanges at a range of 285 pesos to 290 pesos, or a
price/earnings ratio of nearly 6.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAKAGI Securities, a third-tier Japanese broker, has announced the closure
of its London-based affiliate.
The move comes as the slump of the Tokyo stock market is forcing second and
third-tier brokerages to review operations and cut costs. Medium-sized
brokers expanded overseas and domestic operations in the stock market boom
of the late 1980s and made extensive investments in capital investments.
Many medium-sized brokers, which depend heavily on revenues from trading
commissions, are now facing a severe decline in income and profits because
of the low trading volumes in the stock market. According to the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, average daily volume for February fell to 196m shares, the lowest
figure since June 1982, when activity fell to 172m shares.
Second and third-tier securities houses will also be hard-hit by the
financial deregulation expected to be implemented as early as next year,
when the rules separating banks and brokerages will be eased. Mergers and
acquisitions among the smaller brokers are expected to increase due to the
rise of competition in the securities industry.
Tokai Bank, a leading Japanese commercial bank, is to send officials to help
reconstruct Central Finance, its consumer credit affiliate.
Japan's non-bank financial institutions face problems due to the surge in
bad debts caused by the slump in the property and stock markets.
Central Finance was involved in last year's bank loan scandals. It had made
loans up to Y30bn to an Osaka restaurateur on fake deposit certificates by
an Osaka-based credit association used as collateral.
Tokai said it would send seven officials and lend Y110bn to the company.
Central Finance will set up a separate subsidiary in an effort to recover up
to Y100bn of loans.

FT  03 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Turkey to launch Dollars 150m
issue
</HEADLINE>

   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE APPETITE of international investors for high-yielding sovereign bonds
will be tested again today, with Turkey expected to launch a Dollars 150m
five-year issue.
Lead-managed by Bankers Trust International, the bonds will be priced to
yield 255 to 275 basis points more than US Treasury bonds, close to the
yield of Turkey's outstanding bonds in the secondary market. Bankers were
yesterday anticipating a yield spread at the tighter end of this indicated
range.
The deal, which will carry an investor put option after three years, will be
Turkey's first public Eurobond issue since the Gulf crisis began in August
1990. The deal is the first part of a Dollars 1bn funding programme planned
this year.
Elsewhere, Uruguay is expected to tap the international bond market with a
Dollars 75m three-year issue in three months, adding to the roster of Latin
American states which have raised funding in the international bond market.
Lead-managed by JP Morgan Securities, the deal will be Uruguay's first
international debt issue since the debt crisis of the early 1980s. Last
year, the country rescheduled debt with its bank creditors.
The coup attempt last month has not damaged the appetite of international
investors for Venezuelan bonds. Petroleos de Venezuela (PDV) recently raised
Dollars 400m three-year and 10-year funding under its international
medium-term note programme via Chase Investment Bank. They are the first
such issues by a Latin American borrower.
The three-year notes were priced to yield 235 basis points more than US
Treasury bonds of a comparable maturity and the 10-year notes were priced to
yield 297 basis points more than Treasuries.
PDV is majority-owned by the government, which has a long-term debt rating
of Ba1, one notch below investment grade. Turkey is currently being rated
and anticipates a triple-B rating, two notches higher than Venezuela.

<TEXT>
THE Danish government is holding a reverse auction to buy up as much as
DKr25bn of state variable interest bonds.
The bonds have failed to live up to the intention that they should have a
relatively stable price and be a liquid series, according to statement from
Danmarks Nationalbank, the Danish central bank.
Uncertainty about the price has reduced liquidity in the series and lessened
their attractiveness to investors.
The bonds that the authorities buy up will be annulled and replaced by other
instrument, including Treasury bills. Tenders in the reverse auction must be
made by March 9. The authorities will buy up bonds for a maximum of DKr25bn.
Kreditforening Danmark (KD), one of the two big Danish bond-issuing mortgage
credit associations, plans to raise supplementary capital of DKr3bn this
month through a bond issue. This follows a change in the regulations, taking
effect on January 1, which enables the associations to raise supplementary
capital.
KD is the first association to take the opportunity. The issue will be
priced to give it a yield that is 1.50 points above the yield of the
government benchmark 9 per cent bond maturing in 2000.

FT  03 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Demand firm for NTT's Dollars 250m
five-year offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPON Telegraph and Telephone yesterday launched a Dollars 250m five-year
bond issue in the international bond market, the first of a Dollars 1bn
Eurodollar borrowing spree planned by Japanese utility companies this month.
The deal, lead managed by JP Morgan Securities, was launched into a volatile
market, with the Eurodollar market shadowing a  1/2 - point collapse in US
Treasury bonds at the five-year maturity. The five-year US benchmark bond
stood at a yield of 6.67 per cent by the London close, from 6.57 per cent in
early afternoon.
This volatility did not hamper placement of NTT bonds. Most underwriters
said that their allocations of bonds were placed with investors by the time
the US markets opened.
The 6 7/8 per cent NTT bonds were priced to yield 32 basis points more than
US Treasury bonds, considered good value by investors and most participants
in the deal.
Having been reoffered to investors at a fixed price of 99.50, the bonds
traded up to 99.62 bid before the collapse in US Treasury bond prices
dragged the issue lower.
The lead manager reported firm demand from continental European and UK
investors hoping for an appreciation in the US dollar on the foreign
exchange markets. At the close the deal stood at 99.18 bid, for a yield
spread of 28 basis points over Treasuries.
The proceeds of the deal were swapped into yen, but syndicate officials
commented that interest rate and currency swaps opportunities had evaporated
at the end of last week.
Combined with the volatility of dollar bond prices, this may delay the
launch of other planned bond issues by Japanese utilities, including Chuba
Electric, Kansai Electric and Tokyo Electric Power.
Elsewhere, the African Development Bank, the triple-A rated supranational
lending agency, is expected to launch a Dollars 300m issue this week,
possibly today. The 10-year deal, lead managed by Swiss Bank Corporation,
will be the agency's first fixed-rate Eurodollar bond offering.
Syndicate officials were yesterday anticipating that the deal would be
priced to yield around 35 to 40 basis points more than US Treasury bonds. At
this level the bonds would offer a higher yield than paper issued by other
better known supra-national agencies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONWIDE and Woolwich, the UK's second and third largest building
societies, have had their credit ratings called into question by Moody's,
the US credit rating agency.
Woolwich's long-term senior debt rating has been cut by one notch from AA3
to A1, and subordinated debt rating from A2 to A3. Moody's has also placed
under review for possible downgrade the credit ratings of Nationwide.
The move underlines the pressure on building societies caused by the poor
state of the UK housing market.
Moody's said that its decision to cut the Woolwich credit ratings reflected
a decline in the building society's asset quality.
At the end of last year, Woolwich merged with the smaller Town &amp; Country
Building Society, the 15th largest mutual saving's institution in the UK,
which had run into problems following a sharp increase in mortgage defaults
and repossessions. The merger bought Town &amp; Country's Pounds 2.2bn loan
assets, including a high proportion of problem loans, on to the Woolwich
balance sheet.
However, Moody's noted: 'The Town &amp; Country's past lending practices have
been discontinued and replaced by more conservative under-writing.'
The decision to place Nationwide's AA3 long-term credit rating and A2
subordinated debt ratings under review was based on similar concerns about
asset quality.
The rating agency said that its review will 'focus on the loss associated
with high levels of residential loan arrears'.
Renault, the French motor group, has issued a FFr1.2bn domestic bond due
March 30, 2001, paying 9.00 per cent and priced at 99.86 per cent, Reuter
reports from Paris.
The deal, which may be increased to FFr1.5bn before March 16, is being
re-offered at 98.51 per cent, giving a spread of 78 basis points over the
equivalent French government bond. The lead manager is Banque Nationale de
Paris.

FIRST Pacific, the Hong Kong distribution and telecommunications group,
yesterday announced a 21.2 per cent decline in 1991 net earnings to
HKDollars 288.5m (USDollars 38.1m) from HKDollars 366m in 1990.
The company also said it had written off its investment in
Internatio-Muller, a Rotterdam-based trading and transport group, in which
First Pacific bought a 43.2 per cent interest last May.
First Pacific purchased the shares in an attempt to merge the company with
Hagemeyer, a marketing and distribution subsidiary, but this was
successfully blocked by the Internatio-Muller management.
The company said the decline in its profit resulted from significant losses
at Metro Drug, its Philippines subsidiary and Tech Pacific, its Australian
computer software company.
The contribution from banking declined due to the sale of its wholly-owned
banking interests to 67 per cent-owned Hong Kong listing First Pacific
Bancshares.
Cellular telephone operator Pacific Link showed strong growth, more than
doubling its subscriber base in 1991, while Hagemeyer achieved record
profits.
After extraordinary gains and losses associated with asset sales and the
writing off of its Internatio-Muller stake, First Pacific made a gain of
Dollars 115.1m.
Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders reached Dollars 358.5m, up 17.2
per cent from 1990, after the disposal of a number of investments.
The company said it was positioned for a strong profit recovery in 1992. It
announced a final dividend of 5 cents, maintaining the total for the year at
8 cents a share.

BORAL, the Australian building products group, yesterday announced a 28.5
per cent cut in interim net profits to ADollars 91m (USDollars 68.4m) for
the six months to December on sales down 7.7 per cent to ADollars 1.9bn.
The group said trading had continued to be 'subdued' in January and
February. It added that the second-half result was unlikely to exceed the
comparable period of last year, implying a significant fall in full-year
profits.
Boral said the first half was adversely affected by an increase in the
effective tax rate from 38 per cent to 42 per cent and a decline in demand
for most of the group's products.
Australian operations are expected to benefit from infrastructure projects
announced last week by the federal government as part of a package of
measures intended to stimulate the economy.
However, the board said demand for materials for commercial building
construction was expected to continue to decline for some time.
Economic recovery in the US was expected to be 'modest,' and there was
little prospect of growth in the UK. The group said its businesses in both
countries were hit by a low level of demand in the first half.
Boral's balance sheet remained strong in spite of the 'difficult' economic
background. However, bad debts remain a problem: the group wrote off
ADollars 8.3m in the six months, in addition to provisions for doubtful
debts of ADollars 9.9m. The board said the level of bad and doubtful debts
was similar to the 'historically high' level of the 1990-91 financial year.
The directors declared an interim dividend of 8 cents a share, fully
franked, the same as the final dividend for the year to June 1991, but a 33
per cent reduction on the previous first half.

MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial, Japan's biggest consumer electronics
company, yesterday said it had entered talks with American Telephone and
Telegraph (AT&amp;T), the US telecommunications group, that could lead to a
joint venture to develop pen-based portable computer systems.
The talks are the latest in a trend in which consumer electronics companies
are joining forces with computer technology companies to develop products
aimed at re-igniting growth in the industry, which has been suffering from a
lack of new product successes.
Apple Computer is talking to both Sony and Sharp about possible joint
product development. Intel, the world's leading microprocessor maker, has
agreed with Sharp to develop flash memory devices, which could replace
magnetic recording devices in a wide range of consumer and computer
products.
While Matsushita, Sony and Sharp are hoping to gain technology and software
capability, the computer companies are seeking partners that understand
consumer products, that have efficient manufacturing capability, and
effective distribution networks. The companies believe the market for
portable, multi-function devices combining computer and audio visual
technology is potentially huge, although all have maintained strict secrecy
about products under development.
Matsushita also confirmed it was talking to Electronic Arts, a
California-based computer game software developer, about joint development
of video game equipment.
Matsushita said nothing had yet been agreed with either company, and it was
talking to other companies about possible partnerships.
Matsushita said last week its consolidated pre-tax profits in the current
fiscal year, ending this month, would fall by 43 per cent compared with last
year.
Sony earlier said that its parent company would post its first full-year
operating loss. Although the poor results at both companies reflect a
downturn in the business cycle, they also result from the inability to
stimulate consumer demand with the current product line-up.
The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the Japanese business daily, said yesterday that
Matsushita and AT&amp;T were aiming to develop portable pen-based computer
systems that would have a wireless communication function.
The devices would use an operating system developed by Go Corporation, a
California-based software specialist, while Matsushita would provide liquid
crystal display technology.
In the video-game market, Matsushita is considering taking an equity stake
in San Mateo Software Group, which was established by Electronic Arts.
The aim would be to develop game and educational products using
high-definition pictures, high-speed data processing, and compact disk read
only memory.
Although Matsushita is not usually seen as a trailblazer in consumer
electronics, it has tremendous marketing power and has been highly
successful in the past at reading trends in consumer tastes, and developing
profitable electronic devices.

halfway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A SUBSTANTIAL improve- ment on the underwriting account allowed Mutual and
Federal (M&amp;F), South Africa's largest short-term insurer, to increase
after-tax profits by 51 per cent to R68.1m (Dollars 24m) for the half-year
to end-December.
Gross premium income rose by R59m to R600m, while net premiums increased by
11 per cent to R506m. The underwriting surplus increased considerably to
R25.6m compared with the R3.5m recorded at the interim stage in 1990.
Investment income rose to R71m from R56m.
Earnings per share rose to 146 cents a share from 96 cents, and the interim
dividend was lifted by 25 per cent to 25 cents per share.
Mr Ken Saggers, managing director, said the good results reflected the
improved health of the short-term insurance industry which he attributed to
more realistic rating policies. In 1990, the industry suffered unprecedented
aggregate underwriting losses of about R250m. M&amp;F's improved underwriting
performance was the result of an absence of natural catastrophe payouts
which in 1990 accounted for more than R20m at the interim stage.
Mr Saggers said the ongoing recession, and increasing theft, arson and fraud
would continue to present the industry with a challenging operating
environment.
The short term activities of Commercial Union, the South African insurer in
which Commercial Union of the UK is a large shareholder, also benefited from
a turnround on the underwriting account in the year to December 1991.
Pre-tax profit rose to R58.9m from R27.3m, largely due to a R5.3m
underwriting surplus compared with a R18.8m deficit in 1990.
Net income rose to R48.8m from R29.1m.
Earnings per share increased to 488.4 cents from 291.4, and the dividend was
lifted by 35 per cent to 142 cents.

ARGENTINA began yet another foray into the world equities market yesterday
when the government kicked-off an international marketing campaign to sell
its 30 per cent stake in Telecom Argentina, one of the country's two
privatised telephone companies.
The sales offensive began in Paris and will end in San Francisco on March
14, a few days before the offer closes. The government has set a minimum
price of Dollars 640m for the shares, but they are expected to fetch Dollars
800 to Dollars 900m.
Telecom was created in November 1990 when the national telephone network was
privatised and split in two. Telecom, which operates in northern Argentina,
is managed by the French and Italian state telephone companies.
The flotation is expected to repeat last December's successful sale of the
government's 30 per cent stake in Telefonica de Argentina, which runs the
phones in southern Argentina. It raised Dollars 850m for the government, due
largely to strong demand in Argentina.
Half of Telecom's shares will be set aside for leading local and
international investors who will set a sale price in a bidding process.
One-quarter of the remaining shares are ear-marked for large investors and
another quarter for small local investors.
Telecom reported net profit of Dollars 52.3m on sales of Dollars 862.4m in
1991. It forecast sales this year of Dollars 1.2bn and has begun a
five-year, Dollars 3.3bn investment programme. The company expects to raise
annual sales to Dollars 2bn by 1996.

MR YA'ACOV Nimrodi, the Israeli businessman who last week bought the daily
newspaper Ma'ariv from the administrator of Mr Robert Maxwell's Israeli
assets, has sold on half his holding in a deal which gives a rival publisher
a large stake in the company.
Mr Nimrodi, best known outside Israel as an arms dealer who was involved in
the Iran-Contra affair, sold a 22 per cent stake in Ma'ariv Modi'in,
publisher of Ma'ariv, for Dollars 3m to the Schocken family, which publishes
the rival Ha'aretz and Hadashot daily papers.
The move, apparently unhindered by any media monopoly regulations, prompted
speculation that the Schocken group was planning some rationalisation of
Israel's crowded newspaper market in which a survey last week showed most
titles were losing circulation.
The group had also been in negotiation with one of the losing bidders for
Ma'ariv.
Another 22 per cent stake in Ma'ariv was sold by Mr Nimrodi to Mr Jack
Lieberman, an Australian with established investments in Israel, and a local
partner.
Mr Nimrodi paid Dollars 14.5m for Mr Maxwell's 87 per cent holding in
Ma'ariv - significantly less than Arthur Andersen, the administrator, had
originally hoped to raise.
Both the Schocken group and Mr Lieberman have also agreed to put up a
proportional share of the Dollars 10m Mr Nimrodi pledged to inject into
Ma'ariv to pay off bank debt.

profit and payout

IMPROVED cash management, a lower tax bill and a solid performance from
hotel and leisure subsidiary Kersaf helped Safren, the South African
diversified shipping, travel and leisure group, to lift net profit for the
six months to December by 11 per cent.
Turnover rose by 9.3 per cent to R2.3bn and operating profit by 6.4 per cent
to R337.8m (Dollars 119m). A lower tax charge, however, boosted attributable
earnings by 11.1 per cent to R133.3m. Earnings per share rose to 248.3 cents
from 224.5 cents, and the dividend was lifted to 65 cents a share from 60
cents.
Safren recorded a R63m extraordinary loss compared with a R30.3m profit a
year earlier. This was the result of a R78.5m write-off on a 49 per cent
stake in Compagnie Maritime Belge Transport (CMBT) taken by shipping arm
Safmarine last year. Earnings after extraordinary items thus dropped to
R70.3m from R150.3m.
Mr Buddy Hawton, chief executive, said the group knew at the time of
purchase that CMBT was making substantial losses which would take three to
four years to correct. Staff cuts and the closure and disposal of
unprofitable operations had given rise to 'material additional costs of a
non-recurrent nature'.
Mr Hawton said Safmarine had continued to experience reduced cargo volumes
which were lower than at any time since the introduction of containerisation
15 years ago. Rennies, which is involved in travel, freight, cargo and
marine services, and Kersaf, whose main investments are in hotels and
casinos, had both performed satisfactorily.
Mr Hawton expected satisfactory results for the year, given current economic
conditions. But he was more bullish on the longer term outlook,
Safren's shares are trading at R94, 110 per cent up on its price at the
beginning of 1991.

<TEXT>
SA BREWING, the Australian liquor and industrial group, yesterday revealed
an increase of 11.3 per cent in interim net profits to ADollars 56m
(USDollars 42m) and forecast a similar improvement in the second half.
The Adelaide-based group said the improvement was caused by lower interest
charges, cost-cutting, and the first full six-month contribution from
Penfolds, the Australian wine-maker acquired last year.
Mr Ross Wilson, chief executive, said he believed the second-half result
would be 'similar,' but declined to forecast full-year profits because of
uncertainty over Australia's economic outlook.
'Providing economic conditions do not deteriorate further, SA Brewing Group
is confident of continuing to provide an above-average return to
shareholders,' he declared.
Mr Wilson said the group had seen no signs of an end to Australia's
recession. He added that it did not expect an upturn in domestic economic
activity until the beginning of 1993.
However, he said the balance sheet was 'healthy' following a reduction in
debt from ADollars 566m to ADollars 522m. The group was looking a several
possible acquisitions, but no decisions had been made.
The result, which was struck on a 7.8 per cent increase in sales to ADollars
1.04bn, was within analysts' expectations following significant
cost-cutting, notably within the appliances division.
The directors declared an unchanged interim dividend of 7.75 cents a share,
fully franked.
The shares closed 1 cent higher at ADollars 2.89 on the Australian Stock
Exchange.

SEGA Enterprises, Japan's leading maker of commercially-used games
equipment, has agreed to buy WDK, the French games machine maker, for FFr9m,
plus the assumption of undisclosed debt.
Sega last year purchased Deith Leisure, the UK games equipment company, and
has set up a representative office in Spain. Sega also last year purchased
the video games subsidiary of Richard Branson's Virgin Group for Dollars
60m.
The acquisition of WDK will give Sega a large opening into the European
market since WDK will be installing about 220 machines in Euro Disneyland,
which is to open next month. Sega is expecting first year revenue of over
Y500m in the first year. WDK's current annual sales are about FFr100m.

<TEXT>
THE MEXICAN government has sold nearly 82 per cent of the equity in Banco
Mexicano Somex, the country's sixth largest bank, for Dollars 846m,
equivalent to 29 times last year's earnings, and a record 4.63 times book
value.
A group of investors headed by Mr Eduardo Creel, the former Inverlat broker,
and Mr Vicente Aristegui, the former Chrysler Mexico chief, paid Dollars
3.42 a share for a controlling 51 per cent at 5.2 book value.
The group has the option to buy a further 30.62 per cent of Series B stock
at a lower price, which would bring total revenues from the privatisation to
Dollars 846m.
Somex has assets of Dollars 5.38bn, and had profits last year of Dollars
36m. It has 329 branches across Mexico, less than half the number operated
by Banamex, Mexico's largest bank.
The bank has had difficulties with poor loans and a high proportion of
subsidised (and often non-performing) mortgage loans. Until now, it has not
been considered one of the most attractive banks.
However, leading members of Mexico's financial community appear determined
to buy a bank before it is too late, and in the ensuing competition have bid
up the prices. Only six more banks remain in government hands, of which only
one, Banco Internacional, has national coverage. The government hopes to
have sold these banks by the middle of this year.
The second and third bids for Somex were at 4.15 and 3.73 book value
respectively, greater or equal to the winning bids for the four largest
banks already sold.

ESSELTE, the Swedish office products group, yesterday reported a loss of
SKr416m (Dollars 70.15m) for 1991 due to large restructuring costs.
However, the company, which had a 1990 profit of SKr145m, said it would
maintain its dividend of SKr5.25 in the expectation that earnings would
improve this year due to lower costs resulting from its rationalisation
programme.
Esselte said it made a profit after financial items of SKr142m before
deducting the one-time operating costs of SKr558m.
The company has undertaken the extensive restructuring programme in response
to weakening demand. Sales last year fell by 3 per cent to SKr15.6bn.
Esselte has sold its media operations, including Filmnet, the pay TV
channel, to concentrate on its core business of office equipment.
It is also reducing its labour force by 2,950 to around 15,500 workers. Mr
Bo Lindquist, president, said yesterday that the company may be divided in
two to further improve performance.
One unit would consist of the international manufacturing and marketing
operations. The other would concentrate on the Nordic region where Esselte
conducts more wide-ranging activities, including providing electronic office
equipment and information services as well as owning a network of specialist
retail outlets.
A decision on the possible split of the company will be discussed at the
annual meeting in June, when restrictions on foreign shareholdings in the
company are also expected to be removed.

ALCATEL Cable, the wire and cable subsidiary of Alcatel Alsthom, the French
group which is the world's largest maker of telecommunication equipment, saw
net profits increase by 16 per cent to FFr1.27bn (Dollars 220m) in 1991 from
FFr1.1bn in 1990.
The company, which recently reached agreement with the AEG arm of
Daimler-Benz, the German industrial group, to buy its cable business, saw
turnover rise by 12 per cent from FFr24.52bn to FFr27.48bn last year.
The AEG deal, which was announced in October, came too late to affect
Alcatel Cable's results for 1991 although it raised the latter's share of
the German market from 10 to 25 per cent. However, Alcatel Cable had already
made a number of acquisitions - including those of Vacha in eastern Germany
and Orbitec in France - which did contribute during the year.
Alcatel Alsthom recently announced an 11 per cent increase in consolidated
sales to FFr159.9bn in 1991.

TELEFONICA, Spain's government-controlled telecommunications group, lifted
net profits in 1991 by 6.7 per cent to Pta80.9bn (Dollars 783m). It plans to
increase its dividend by the same percentage to Pta87.2 per share from
Pta81.7 in 1990.
Presenting consolidated accounts for the first time to meet stock market
rulings, Telefonica posted after-tax profits of Pta103.9bn due to good
results at home and abroad plus asset disposals.
Consolidated subsidiaries, in which the parent company has a 20 per cent to
50 per cent holding, include Chile's CTC and Entel telephone networks.
Together, these contributed Pta7.7bn to group profits.
A further Pta20bn was earned through the disposal of Telefonica's stakes in
Alacatel and Telettra following the merger of the two companies last year.
Income from subsidiaries and disposals helped Telefonica comfortably through
extraordinary costs of Pta19.4bn incurred by Telefonica's decision to
transfer its in-house pension scheme to the national security system.
News of this development last week caused a sharp drop in the group's share
price.
Group capital investment fell by 13.6 per cent last year to Pta589.1bn after
years of sustained expansion in new equipment and lines.
Demand for new lines fell by 10.6 per cent last year, constituting a key
indicator of the slowdown of the domestic economy.

AEROPORTS de Paris, the company that operates 14 Paris airports including
Charles de Gaulle and Orly, sustained a slight fall in net profits to
FFr381m (Dollars 68.03m) in 1991 from FFr410m in 1990.
Mr Bernard Lathere, chairman, said that Aeroports de Paris, like other
travel companies, was hit by the instability in the travel market last year.
The number of passengers going through Orly and Charles de Gaulle, the two
largest Paris airports, fell by 3.3 per cent. Orly attracted 23.3m
passengers and Charles de Gaulle 22m. The level of freight business was also
depressed by just over 2 per cent to 853,000 tonnes and the volume of mail
fell by 5.8 per cent to 59,000 tonnes.
Turnover, according to Mr Lathere, should have risen by about 5 per cent to
FFr5.3bn in 1991. Aeroports de Paris, which also has interests in property,
plans to raise its investment to FFr3.2bn in 1992 representing an increase
of 76 per cent over last year.

THE financially-stretched DG Bank has called in a firm of auditors to
investigate the activities of the bank and its management and supervisory
boards between January 1989 to mid-1991.
The precise scope of the investigation by Deutsche Treuhand Gesellschaft, a
German accountancy firm, has not been made public, although during the
period under review DG Bank became embroiled in disputes with French banks
over bond sales and repurchase agreements, ultimately requiring DG Bank to
take heavy write-offs.
DG Bank would only confirm yesterday, in response to an article in the
Spiegel news magazine, that the investigation was under way and had been
approved by management and supervisory boards.
In October last year, Mr Bernd Thiemann, the bank's chief executive since
early 1991, announced a DM1.4bn (Dollars 840m) cash injection and said the
bank would only break even at the operating level.

BANCO di Napoli, the big Italian public sector bank which last year floated
20 per cent of its shares on the stock market, raised gross profits before
depreciation and provisions by 11.3 per cent to L856bn (Dollars 696m) last
year.
The bank announced it would issue 53.25m new ordinary shares as part of a
L213bn rights issue, reserved for the Italian Treasury. The deal marks the
second tranche of a four-stage L850bn plan to bolster its capital ratios via
the injection of fresh funds from the public sector.
Boosted by the opening of 101 new branches last year, total deposits
increased by 14.5 per cent to L75,700bn, while loans rose by 18 per cent to
L63,700bn. Total assets for the bank rose to around L97,000bn at the end of
last year from L83,000bn in December 1990.
Banco di Napoli's net worth jumped by 159 per cent to L4,233bn following the
revaluation of its assets as part of Italy's bank reform provisions and the
arrival of fresh capital from both private shareholders and the Treasury.
Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss confectionery group, has completed its long search
to break into the Italian coffee market with agreement to buy Splendid, the
country's second biggest coffee brand, from Procter &amp; Gamble Italia.
No price for the deal was disclosed. However, Splendid and Caramba, a second

annual sales of about L140bn.

DOMESTIC &amp; General Group, the appliance breakdown insurer, lifted profits by
28 per cent, from Pounds 2.13m to Pounds 2.73m pre-tax, in the half-year to
December 31.
The lack of any upturn in retail sales of electrical appliances resulted in
growth of new business premiums slowing. However, Mr Martin Copley,
chairman, said increased direct mailing activity had led to improved numbers
of annual contracts being sold over the past two years and that this had led
to higher levels of renewal premiums.
'Margins have improved, with expenses growing at a slower rate than written
premiums,' he added.
Gross premium income amounted to Pounds 21.4m - an improvement of 36 per
cent - while investment income rose some 17 per cent to to Pounds 2.63m.
Strict claims controls maintained loss ratios at 'acceptable levels'.
Earnings per share rose almost 35 per cent to 26.74p (19.85p). The interim
dividend goes up by 1.5p to 6p.

LILLESHALL, the building products, plastics, engineering and industrial
consumables group, announced pre-tax profits down from a restated Pounds
2.77m to Pounds 2.4m in the 1991 year.
Turnover increased to Pounds 36.4m (Pounds 33.9m) as a number of
acquisitions made during the year contributed for the first time.
Mr John Leek, the former merchant banker who has built up the company since
taking over as chairman in 1988, described the results as 'a creditable
performance in a difficult trading period'.
The building products division, which mainly sells to local authorities and
housing associations, improved operating profits to Pounds 2.51m (Pounds
1.76m), helped by a seven-month contribution from Malysse, the French
subsidiary acquired in May.
Industrial consumables slipped into an operating loss of Pounds 619,000,
against a Pounds 756,000 profit last time. This was mainly due to lower
prices for the company's steel fasteners. But Mr Leek said overheads had
been cut and the division was now breaking even.
Earnings per share fell to 7.5p (12.9p). A recommended final dividend of
2.5p makes a total of 4p (3.9p) for the year.
Since the year-end Lilleshall has acquired two companies, Crystalware
Products and Bradgrange Packaging, to expand its plastics business. Mr Leek
said further acquisitions would be looked at, especially if they allowed the
company to increase exports and exposure to Europe.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern is growing over the potential dangers of Nolvadex, ICI's main
anti-cancer drug, after the Medical Research Council's decision to study
more information before approving funds for a clinical trial.
The New Scientist said that the MRC delayed approval after receiving new
information about the drug's toxic effects on rats. Nolvadex is a
well-established drug, generating sales of Pounds 240m last year for ICI.
The trial, which would involve 15,000 women, is aimed at discovering whether
Nolvadex - used to treat breast cancer since the 1970s - could be used as a
preventative measure on healthy people.
The article was underscored by a report quoting the University of Texas's
Galveston medical school. The report said Nolvadex might cause liver cell
damage.
Researchers said they found a proliferation of liver cell mutations in
laboratory rats after three days of injections with the drug.
Mr Richard Henderson, a chemicals analyst with Nomura Research, said: 'It is
quite clear from existing literature that the effect on laboratory rats is
radically different from that on people. However, the behaviour of the MRC
suggests that there is something new out there and maybe it is in the
Galveston story.'

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Petrocon bid 'undervalues Wilkes potential'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ARTHUR Watt, chairman of James Wilkes, the engineering group which is
fighting a bid from Petrocon, yesterday claimed the company's worst problems
were behind it after the recent departure of its 'spendthrift' chairman. He
called on shareholders to reject the all-paper offer.
He said the bid was opportunist and took advantage of the lack of support
for Mr Stephen Hinchliffe, the former chairman who resigned after Petrocon
launched its bid. The bid, now worth Pounds 32m, was launched on the back of
overvalued Petrocon shares and would grossly undervalue Wilkes' potential
and the strength of its core engineering companies, Mr Watt said.
Under Mr Hinchliffe's buccaneering leadership Wilkes' central costs grew
almost as quickly as the company's debt. The head office operation in a
stately house outside Sheffield included a helicopter company.
Mr Watt said that after disposal of non-core businesses, including the
helicopter company and a promotional products division which is one of the
world's largest maker of beer mats, debt could be brought down from an
'excessive' Pounds 27m to nearer Pounds 10m for gearing of about 60 per
cent.
Mr Watt now plans to try to convince institutions that he is better
qualified than Mr Colin Robinson, Petrocon's chairman, to head a
slimmed-down Wilkes and give shareholders their first decent return on their
investment.
As Wilkes posted its defence document, Petrocon continued to question
whether Mr Watt was suitable to lead Wilkes given his association with Mr
Hinchliffe and various aspects of his business career.
Petrocon advisers pointed out that Mr Watt was a director of a Scottish
company, Computer Services (Scotland). He resigned one month before it went
into receivership leaving unsecured creditors with a deficit of Pounds
400,000.
Mr Robinson also refuted Wilkes' claim that there were no commercial
benefits. After Petrocon buys Beverley, a company making fluid pumps valves
and pipe fittings, which is controlled by Mr Robinson, there would synergy
with Wilkes' core businesses.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Low steel prices cut ASW to Pounds 2.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER

<TEXT>
FALLS IN steel prices of between 10 and 20 per cent hit profits at ASW
Holdings, the Cardiff-based steel and wire group. It made only Pounds 2.3m
before tax last year, compared with Pounds 40.3m in 1990.
ASW cut its final dividend from 8p to 4.5p, making a total of 9p (12.5p).
The share price fell 7p to a new low of 131p.
Mr Alan Cox, chief executive, said that in 1990 prices in Europe had been
the same as in 1985. 'From that point, they came down by at least 10 per
cent and in some cases by 15 to 20 per cent.'
This accounted for the bulk of the Pounds 31.6m decline in operating profit
to Pounds 9m. Exceptional charges for a further round of cost-cutting
amounted to Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 1m).
Mr Cox said there had been no closures, but 200 jobs had been shed and more
were to come.
'We are one of the lowest cost producers in Europe and we are competing in
an arena where the whole industry is losing a lot of cash.'
There have been complaints from some producers about state subsidies
sustaining the low prices. Mr Cox said it was not only state-owned companies
that were 'losing cash in a way that we would find difficult', but also
parts of large groups.
Differing financial systems also played a part.
Group turnover fell 14 per cent to Pounds 390.7m (Pounds 454.3m). An
increase in sales outside Europe from Pounds 13.9m to Pounds 37m could not
offset the near Pounds 86.7m fall within it. However, Mr Cox pointed out
that this was partly because the group no longer needed to buy in billet to
satisfy UK demand. Little profit had been made on that transaction.
ASW held cash of about Pounds 1m compared with Pounds 24.4m in December
1990. This was after paying nearly Pounds 18m for Bird Fragmentation, the
scrap metal group, plus tax and dividends.
Capital spending had been kept at nearly Pounds 10m.
Losses per share were 1.9p (earnings 37.1p). The retained loss was Pounds
7.2m (Pounds 16.1m profit), reducing 1990 shareholders' funds of Pounds
152m.
COMMENT
ASW gained some credit for staying in the black at the operating level and
for conserving cash, while many of its competitors lost out on both counts.
The exceptional charges look high, but at least the decks should have been
cleared for this year. The group clings tenaciously to its reputation as one
of Europe's lowest cost producers, which should bode well when the
long-awaited upturn in European prices arrives. The big question is when
will it arrive? And the answer is a lottery. One analyst is forecasting
Pounds 10m pre-tax if prices for some products, such as wire rod, start to
rise in the second quarter. Another is going for Pounds 5m on the assumption
there will be no improvement until the third quarter. While prices have
stopped falling, there has so far been little action, such as a wave of
closures, to effect a rationalisation of capacity. The prospective p/e is 13
even on the more optimistic figure. However, the yield of just over 9 per
cent looks fairly secure (even though the interim may be cut) and should
support the price.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Dalepak Foods in takeover talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DALEPAK FOODS, the food manufacturer, said yesterday that it was in
preliminary discussions to sell part, or all, of the company.
The announcement was prompted by a 71p increase in the company's share
price, which closed at 433p.
Stockbrokers de Zoete &amp; Bevan have approached a number of possible buyers
following the decision by Mr Jonathan Ropner, Dalepak's chairman, to sell
his 20 per cent shareholding. .The five other executive directors own just
under 30 per cent of the group.
The sale is likely to make multi-millionaires out of the directors as the
group is valued at about Pounds 50m.
Although de Zoete &amp; Bevan stressed that the talks were in a 'very, very
preliminary stage', the group is expected to be sold to one buyer.
The rise in the share price was boosted by a bullish note published last
Friday by Metropolitan Optima, a division of Metropolitan General Investment
Company.
It recommended the shares a 'buy', commending the group's management for its
successful diversification into frozen baked products and chilled ready
meats. Pre-tax profits for the year to end-April 1991 were Pounds 3.02m
(Pounds 1.92m). Analysts were forecasting continued profits growth over the
next two years.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: MTM's warning on profits prompts shares to
dive 21%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN MTM yesterday fell by 60 1/2 p to 226p after the specialist
chemicals company warned that its profits for 1991 would fall substantially
below City expectations.
At one time the share price fell to 180p.
The company said it was discussing with Binder Hamlyn, its auditor, the
application of certain accounting policies, in particular in relation to the
valuation of some fixed assets.
MTM said it expected to recommend a final dividend of 3.73p, giving a total
for the year of 5.6p, up from 5.1p in 1990. The company said its trading
performance showed a sound, profitable business which demonstrated strong
growth. MTM will now report on March 31 instead of this Thursday.
The offending practice which caught the auditor's eye this year was MTM's
capitalisation of some product and process costs. In previous years Binder
Hamlyn had gone along with MTM's treatment of the process development costs
as intangible assets.
The impact of the auditor's change of interpretation, according to one
analyst, appears to be to the reduction of pre-tax profits - forecast until
yesterday at about Pounds 23m for the year - by between Pounds 2.5m and
Pounds 4m.
MTM said the full impact of the accounting interpretation has not yet become
clear.
Ultimately the tightening of the interpretation might work in MTM's favour,
analysts believe. The change has no cash impact and MTM's shares have been
trading at a discount to the chemical sector partly because of doubts about
this less than conservative approach to the valuation of intangibles.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Sale of 'core business' marks end of
mistimed break-up bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWATER'S purchase of DRG Packaging for Pounds 212m closes the final chapter
on one of the most bitterly contested and mistimed of the break-up bids
which dominated the 1980s.
Mr Roland Franklin, a former associate of Sir James Goldsmith, put together
a consortium of wealthy investors in 1989 to pay Pounds 697m for DRG, the
Bristol-based paper and packaging group, which included brand names such as
Sellotape and Basildon Bond stationery.
Mr Franklin said he intended to unlock the unrealised value of DRG by
disposing of peripheral activities and slimming it down to a core packaging
business.
However, the debt incurred was taken on just before the onset of the
recession which slowed the rate of disposals. Yesterday's sale brought the
declared total realised by disposals to about Pounds 622m, which is well
short of the purchase price plus financing costs.
Mr Franklin's son, Mr Martin Franklin, said yesterday that the
privately-owned consortium, Pembridge Investments, had not published all of
its disposals, but admitted: 'This is a deal which was not exciting from our
shareholders' point of view.'
Last year Pembridge was refinanced and control of the consortium went to
Societe de Banque Thomson, the French finance house led by Mr Jean-Francois
Henin.
Pembridge originally raised Pounds 130m from 18 equity investors. The
biggest stake was Pounds 60m from Mr Ted Field, the US millionaire. Four of
the investors, including Mr Field, backed Sir James's unsuccessful attempt
to break up BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group.
Mr Roland Franklin's own company, Pembridge Associates, contributed Pounds
31m. Mr Franklin paid almost 15 times DRG's last audited earnings.
After the takeover, DRG's stationery group, which included Basildon Bond,
Lion and Challenge, was sold to Biber Holding, a Swiss company, for an
undisclosed sum in 1990.
Last year Sellotape, Britain's best-selling adhesive tape, was bought by a
team of French industrialists, backed by French bankers, for about Pounds
70m.
DRG Packaging, which was sold yesterday, had originally been identified by
Pembridge as the core business on which it intended to focus.
A specialist in plastic packaging, it supplies the medical packaging market
and is a leading supplier of rigid plastic food containers in the UK. Last
year it made operating profits of Pounds 18.7m.
Mr Martin Franklin said that after yesterday's sale, Pembridge retained the
Strachan Henshaw machinery business in the UK, which has an annual turnover
of Pounds 15m; some Canadian holdings in paper converting and packaging,
which he said were worth about Pounds 20m; and property holdings, worth an
estimated Pounds 30m.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Bowater shows marginal decrease to Pounds
112.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWATER, the packaging and industrial films group which yesterday scooped up
two more packaging companies, saw a marginal decrease in its pre-tax profits
in 1991 from Pounds 113.1m to Pounds 112.7m.
Sales fell from Pounds 1.37bn to Pounds 1.27bn in the face of recession in
Bowater's key markets in the UK, the US and Australia and operating margins
slipped from 8.7 per cent to 8.6 per cent.
Mr Norman Ireland, chairman, said this was a 'creditable' performance in the
difficult circumstances but foresaw no early improvement in trading
conditions.
Bowater's fully-diluted earnings per share fell from 50.2p to 47p but the
company lifted its final dividend by 8.7 per cent to 12.5p bringing the
total to 22p (21p).
The company received Pounds 4.2m in interest payments compared with an
outflow of Pounds 5.9m last year. But it recorded an extraordinary charge of
Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 26.6m credit) relating to rationalisation costs and a
provision for the medical benefits of its retiring American employees.
Mr David Lyon, chief executive, said: 'In the UK we have been bumping along
on the bottom flat for four months.' But he added that orders and sales had
picked up in the US. 'We may be living in the reflected success of our
customers. We may be managing our business better or there may be an upturn
in demand,' he said.
Bowater's engineering and tissue businesses in Australia had also recorded
some encouraging signs, Mr Lyon said. By division, Bowater's operating
profits were: print and packaging Pounds 66.7m (Pounds 79.8m); coated films
Pounds 17.6m (15m); building and engineering Pounds 16.2m (Pounds 16m); and
tissue Pounds 6m (Pounds 4.4m).
In recent years, Bowater has narrowed its range of businesses but the two
acquisitions announced yesterday will broaden its exposure to other
packaging markets. Bowater's sales to the medical, pharmaceutical and
personal care markets will rise from Pounds 150m to Pounds 370m and will
bolster the company's presence in mainland Europe.
Mr Lyon said the company had completed six purchases in the past year and
was still in a position to make small add-on acquisitions.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Vestey arm poaches second Lonrho chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading group, has lost its second executive
within two months to Union International (UI), the troubled arm of the
Vestey Group, one of Britain's largest private companies.
Mr Paul Taylor, a former finance executive of Lonrho, who was part of a
senior team evaluating projects and capital expenditure, has been appointed
finance director of UI.
He was recruited by Mr Terry Robinson, UI's chief executive, who in January
left Lonrho where he had been a director since 1981.
A businessman with an intimate knowledge of Lonrho yesterday described Mr
Taylor's departure as a 'loss' to the group.
He said Mr Taylor was 'a bright financial executive' who had responsibility
for assessing and reviewing 'significant capital projects'.
Lonrho's annual report revealed that Mr Taylor was one of 10 new associate
directors designed to show that the group has the 'depth and breadth of
management' to end speculation about the succession to Mr Tiny Rowland, its
74 year-old chief executive.
The conglomerate yesterday made light of Mr Taylor's departure. A Lonrho
director said: 'The company went on without Mr Robinson and it will go on to
manage its business very well without Mr Taylor. We do not rely on one man.'
It is understood that Mr Taylor will work closely with Mr Robinson on
finalising the details of UI's three-year funding facility with its bankers.
UI, which includes the Dewhurst butchers chain, is expected to publish its
1991 results in the summer once the funding facility has been agreed.
The group has borrowings of about Pounds 350m.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Resignation of Lucas finance head 'a matter
of personality and style'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Hankinson, the finance director of Lucas Industries, resigned
yesterday after personality clashes in the group's management team.
The auto and aerospace components and applied technology group made a sparse
announcement to the Stock Exchange, noting merely the resignation and
promising a further statement on the appointment of Mr Hankinson's
successor.
The resignation has happened at a sensitive time for Lucas. Its interim
figures are due at the end of the month and are expected to record
break-even at best. Downturns in both the aerospace and vehicle markets have
been met by a series of cost-cutting measures.
The message Lucas was sending to the City last night was that the
resignation would not affect its dividend policy. With the profit and loss
account at break-even, the likelihood was that the interim dividend would be
maintained at the 1990 and 1991 level of 2.1p.
Against this background, Lucas was anxious to offer the reassurance that
there was 'nothing sinister' in Mr Hankinson's resignation. What had
happened 'can happen in any family or team', the group said.
The resignation came 'as a matter of personality and style within the Lucas
management team', the group added. Tensions in this team had evidently
reached such a point that somebody had to go.
The members of the team were Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and chief executive,
Mr Tony Edwards, managing director of aerospace, Mr Bob Dale, managing
director of automotive, Mr Brian Mason, personnel director and recently
promoted to the board, Mr John Parnaby, managing director of applied
technology, who is not on the board, and Mr Hankinson himself.
But Mr Hankinson's departure follows a reshuffle of responsibilities. Sir
Anthony's job is being split. He will remain as chairman, but Mr Edwards won
the job of group managing director.
Mr Hankinson, who is 52, has been finance director at Lucas for just short
of three years.
Previously he had been finance director at Chloride Group and at Rover
Group, in each case for periods also of three years.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: European Leisure passes preference dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN LEISURE, the entertainments group, is to pass this year's dividend
on its preference shares in the light of a profit warning it gave yesterday.
The group is expected to announce later this month that interest payments on
its borrowings, which are now in excess of Pounds 72.5m, have wiped out
operating profit for the half year to the end of December. The shares fell
2p to 5p.
In the first half of the year to June 1991, pre-tax profit nearly doubled
from Pounds 2.26m to Pounds 4.42m.
Passing the dividends due in April and October will save Pounds 1.5m,
including ACT.
A comprehensive review of strategy and trading operations is likely to lead
to the sale of a number of assets in the UK and the Continent.
The disposals are expected to be made at about half their valuation,
resulting in a write-down as an exceptional item for the half year.
The group, advised by the merchant bank Charterhouse, has reached agreement
with its banking syndicate for the provision of additional borrowing
facilities through to April 1993.

FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Chelsea given completion date for ground
purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARCH 26 has been set as the date when Chelsea Football Club should complete
the Pounds 22.85m purchase of its west London ground from a subsidiary of
Cabra Estates, the heavily indebted property company.
The date has been agreed by both sides, but Chelsea has described this as a
matter of routine and plans to appeal against the recently imposed High
Court order to complete the purchase.
'Hopefully by the end of the week we will apply for a stay of the order to
pay Pounds 23m,' said Mr Peter Taylor of Denton Hall Burgin &amp; Warrens, the
club's solicitors.
Chelsea is continuing to pursue a claim for damages against the vendor. Its
aim is to get a damages award set against the purchase price. Last week's
judgment was not favourable to this line of argument and Chelsea also
intends to take this claim to appeal.
Cabra, which last week announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 11.3m for the six
months to September 30, wants to get the money in before its March 31
year-end. It would help to reduce net debt of about Pounds 52m, which is on
demand.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Wellcome shares hit by sell-off plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Wellcome, the UK drug group, fell 60p to Pounds 10.66 yesterday as
the stock market digested the news that the Wellcome Trust is to reduce its
stake in the company from 73.6 per cent to as little as 25 per cent.
However, fund managers and analysts said they thought the fall was
temporary.
The sale could raise as much as Pounds 4.5bn making it the largest
non-privatisation issue yet seen in the UK.
Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of the Wellcome Trust, which funds medical
research, said that no decision had yet been made on how much would be sold.
He said that it would be wrong to make a series of sales, and better to do
it in one move. The trust will keep at least 25 per cent of Wellcome's
shares for the long term, which he defined as a minimum of five years.
The sale depends on approval from the High Court to reduce the trust's stake
below 50.1 per cent. Mr Gibbs said: 'We believe we have a reasonable
prospect of a judgment in our favour.'
The money raised will be reinvested, Mr Gibbs said, in a broadly spread
international portfolio yielding 4 1/2 per cent to 4 3/4 per cent, rather
than the 1.2 per cent yield the trust is receiving from its Wellcome shares.
He said every Pounds 1bn raised would increase the trust's annual income by
Pounds 35m.
Mr John Robb, chief executive of Wellcome, said that the shares had had
scarcity value, but 'I do not think it is a good thing to have a scarcity
value in a share price. Removing it will be positive rather than negative'.
Fund managers said that a number of institutions had decided not to buy
Wellcome shares because it was difficult to acquire sufficient stock to make
a meaningful holding. 'This will make it a company institutions can look at
as a sensible one to invest in,' said one manager.
Details of the sale, which is likely to take place in the summer, have yet
to be agreed. However, it is expected that the sale could be arranged on a
basis similar to that of the BT sale late last year.
Advisers to the Wellcome sale are hoping for the price to be set at a
premium to the prevailing share price. There may be plans for existing
shareholders to have priority in the sale. A large part of the issue is
expected to be sold in the US.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Lord Rothschild links up with Wolfensohn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JAMES Wolfensohn and Lord Rothschild, two of the world's best known
financiers, are forming a European-based business to advise international
companies on mergers and acquisitions.
The new business, to be called J. Rothschild, Wolfensohn &amp; Co, will be owned
in equal portions by James D Wolfensohn Incorporated, the New York-based
corporate adviser, and J. Rothschild &amp; Co.
The creation of the business, whose capital will be in 'the low few millions
of dollars' according to Mr Wolfensohn, marks a return for Lord Rothschild
to the business of advising companies on transactions.
He has not been actively involved in corporate finance since he fell out
with his cousin, Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, 12 years ago, and left his
family's merchant bank, NM Rothschild.
Mr Wolfensohn, who was born in Australia, controls one of New York's most
profitable corporate advisory firms. Over the past couple of years, he has
come to the view that his firm needed to 'expand its practice into Europe',
he said.
He has known Lord Rothschild for 25 years and mentioned his plan to him over
dinner six months ago. Mr Wolfensohn said the venture had 'captured the
imagination' of Lord Rothschild.
He did not regard it as a drawback that none of Lord Rothschild's existing
businesses are involved in giving advice on mergers and acquisitions to
companies. Mr Wolfensohn said that there could have been problems in linking
with a London-based merchant bank, because the interests of his clients and
those of the merchant bank could have conflicted.
Lord Rothschild said he was delighted Mr Wolfensohn had chosen London as the
base for the new venture. 'It was touch and go whether it was set up in
Frankfurt or London', he said.
In the past two years, Wolfensohn Inc, whose chairman is Mr Paul Volcker,
former chairman of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, has advised on
corporate transactions with a value of Dollars 15bn.
Mr Volcker will be chairman of the London-based venture. Lord Rothschild and
Mr Wolfensohn will be vice-chairmen. About 10 executives will be recruited.
In January, Lord Rothschild's new life assurance business, formed with Sir
Mark Weinberg, began trading.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Yamaichi losses will exceed Y10bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
YAMAICHI Securities, one of Japan's Big Four brokers, said yesterday it
would report a loss for the year to the end of March, the first since the
company was restructured in the mid-1960s during a stock market crisis.
Mr Atsuo Miki, a Yamaichi vice-president, said the company would report a
pre-tax loss of more than Y10bn (Pounds 44.64m). Other reports have put the
likely loss at Y17bn. Yamaichi had pre-tax profits of Y67.5bn for the
previous year.
Yamaichi's earnings have been undermined by the problems facing Japan's
leading houses: low volumes and weak prices on the Tokyo stock market. It is
expected that about 10 of the largest 14 Japanese brokers will report losses
for the current year.
The company reported a pre-tax loss of Y5.4bn in the first half, its first
for 27 years. It suffered a Y12.3bn loss on its own securities trading and a
25.1 per cent fall in commission income, which had been eroded by a 34 per
cent decline in Tokyo market turnover during the first half. At the time, it
forecast a full-year profit.
Yamaichi estimated that the measures imposed by the Ministry of Finance
after last year's stock market scandals had cost the company between Y2bn
and Y3bn. But the indirect costs of the effects on investor confidence are
likely to be greater, as Tokyo prices have remained low and exchange
officials are still discussing ways of attracting individuals back to the
market.
In previously forecasting a full-year profit of Y20bn, Yamaichi had been
apparently hoping for a daily average turnover of about 300m during the
second half, but first section turnover has remained weak, and last week saw
an average 189.08m shares, down from 201.18m in the previous week.
The lack of new money in the market has been highlighted by the change in
fortunes of investment trusts, which have been net stock sellers for eight
consecutive months. The industry reported yesterday that net share purchases
last month totalled Y354.2bn, against net sales of Y527.6bn.
Japanese brokers expect the market to remain weak until the end of the
financial year, which is often marked by companies selling off shares to
cash in unrealised gains.
However, brokers are generally confident that investor sentiment will turn
in the second half.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Carlsberg launches DKr1bn cash call

CARLSBERG, the Danish brewing group, which is proposing to merge its UK
brewing interests with those of Allied Lyons, is to strengthen its finances
by a DKr1.06bn (Pounds 95.24m) rights issue.
The Danish group is relatively small. Sales last year were DKr10.2bn, but it
has a world-wide reputation as supplier of the Carlsberg and Tuborg lager
brands.
It has breweries in the UK, Germany, Portugal, Malawi, Malaysia, Hong Kong
and Turkey as well as in Denmark. The group has increased its profits in
every year for the past decade. Last year post-tax profits were DKr789m, a
return on equity of 13.8 per cent.
Carlsberg and Allied Lyons took the markets by surprise last year when they
announced a joint venture to bring together their UK brewing interests to
create a group with a strong portfolio of beers, including Carlsberg and
Tuborg, Castlemaine XXXX, Skol and Lowenbrau, as well as Tetley Bitter and
Draught Burton ale.
The merger, proposed last October, is still under the scrutiny of the UK
competition authorities. The venture will encompass Allied's six breweries
and wholesaling operations, and Carlsberg's brewery at Northampton, one of
the most efficient in the UK, together with its distribution network.
Carlsberg has not specified what the new funds will be used for but Prof
Kristof Glamann, supervisory board chairman, told the annual meeting in
December, when hinting at a share issue, that increasing international
competition made a strong financial position necessary.
He said that Carlsberg needed capital for acquisitions and investment in new
technology and sales and marketing.
The issue of one new A or B share for 11 existing shares will be priced at
DKr200 per share with a denomination of DKr20. This is well below the stock
market price. The market traded the Carlsberg B share down by DKr22 to
DKr319 and the A share by DKr18 to DKr333.
The issue will open for subscription on March 30. The issuing banks have
underwritten the issue. The Carlsberg Foundation, which has a controlling
interest in the group, has guaranteed to subscribe 51 per cent of the issue,
which is for A shares with a face value of DKr58.7m and DKr47.7m for the B
shares.

FT  03 MAR 92 / A timely move by sober management: A look at the prospects
for Bowater's latest acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bowater has built up a reputation as a thoroughly sensible business. Its
down-to-earth products, spanning consumer products packaging, book printing
and window safety films, smack of wholesomeness; its management reeks of
prudence; and its profits record - apart from this year's minor blip as a
result of the recession - reveals consistent progress.
Since new management came on board in April 1987, Bowater's sprawling
interests in the paper and packaging sectors have been slimmed down and
spruced up as the company has slid into new areas of activity through a
series of shrewd acquisitions.
Mr Norman Ireland, the company's chairman and former guiding spirit at the
BTR industrial holding group, has made a wily contribution to the company's
acquisitive restructuring while Mr David Lyon, as chief executive, and Mr
Michael Hartnall, finance director, have given the company new strategic
direction as well as more rigorous cost control systems. The company now
consists of 90 operating units clustered around its core skills.
In spite of their achievements, the management trio is somewhat dour and
sober-suited; just about the only concession to flamboyance is Mr Lyon's
penchant for colourful neckties. But such characteristics are much prized in
the current market conditions and it was perhaps unsurprising that in spite
of springing two acquisitions for Pounds 444m, a Pounds 333.5m rights issue
and a slight drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 112.7m the market yesterday
pushed Bowater's shares down only 3p to 765p.
The acquisitions of DRG Packaging and Cope Allman Packaging are in part
sheer opportunism but they also serve a distinct longer-term strategic
purpose. Both were the subject of highly-leveraged acquisitions and have
since had to labour under severe borrowing constraints, exacerbated by the
recession in the UK.
DRG, which supplies speciality packaging to the food and healthcare markets,
was bought by Pembridge Investments, a private takeover vehicle, for Pounds
697m in 1989. But the company has since struggled in some unforgiving
markets.
'DRG has been hauled over the coals over the past few years and has lacked
good industrial direction,' Mr Lyon said yesterday. He added that Bowater
would now spend more than Pounds 30m building a much-needed facility to
rehouse some of DRG's packaging businesses - a move which the previous
management had outlined but had been unable to afford.
Similarly, Cope Allman, a cosmetics and pharmaceuticals products packaging
group which was last sold for Pounds 210m in 1988 at the top of the cycle,
has also been hit by tough market conditions - especially in the cosmetics
field. Mr Lyon said that even the collapse of communism in eastern Europe
had worked against the company depriving it of a lucrative side-line in
supplying posh cosmetics to the nomenklatura.
From a cost point of view, Bowater accepts it can squeeze little more out of
these businesses, but believes it can apply muscle in terms of buying and
securing better financing terms. It already sees a big opportunity for
transferring Cope Allman's US skills in developing child-resistant packaging
(for such items as bleach bottles) to the less developed European market.
Mr Tim Rothwell, packaging industry analyst at stockbrokers Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, said the acquisitions represented a good opportunity for
Bowater. 'These are two high-quality businesses that have suffered from
operating under the constraints of a leveraged buy-out situation. Now that
the future of these businesses is secured you will see an improvement in
their morale and sales efforts and a higher level of customer confidence,'
he said.
The only doubts other analysts raised concerned whether Bowater would be
able to make the acquisitions work hard enough to enhance earnings if the
recession persisted.
Mr Mike Murphy, of Warburg Securities, suggested Bowater might lift earnings
per share to 50p this year compared with a restated 48.5p but the company
had little room for error.
Mr Lyon argued that the deals developed Bowater's mainland European
businesses making it better able to respond to the changing demands of the
market. He suggested that the growing agglomeration of consumer products
companies such as Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble, BSN, and Nestle on a
pan-European basis would increasingly mean that their packaging needs would
have to be satisfied on an international dimension.
Such thinking has underpinned the wave of restructuring in the European
packaging industry that has led to the formation of CMB, the Anglo-French
packaging group, the acquisition of European operations of American National
Can by Pechiney, the purchase of the European arm of Continental Can by
Viag, and the merger of Rockware and BTR.
'There is a restructuring taking place and there are going to be
opportunities to participate in more partnership relationships with product
manufacturers. By doing so you drive out costs, speed up quality and shorten
the time it takes to get new products to market,' Mr Lyon said.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Letter: Britannia Park juror: a complicated case, but not
beyond comprehension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD ELMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was with interest that I read the letter from Mrs Edna Wijeratna
(Letters, March 2) regarding the role of juries in long or complicated fraud
trials. As some of your readers may be aware, the UK's longest fraud trial
to date, the Britannia Park case, finished in Nottingham recently.
I had the (perhaps dubious) honour of sitting on the jury in that trial and
feel that I too must now put pen to paper on the issue of trial by jury in
this type of case.
It was said in an interview on Central Television that, according to the
expert concerned, there was no way that our jury (which included local
businessmen, and those with some financial knowledge) could have understood
all the pertinent facts in the case.
This most certainly was not so. We had the benefit of a judge who normally
sits in commercial cases and he, together with the prosecution and indeed
the defence counsels, made certain that the import of all the financial
evidence was made abundantly clear for all of us.
We were at times frustrated by the slow progress made on occasion due to
points which, while no doubt vital at the time to prosecution or defence,
were argued in great detail only to fall by the wayside later on in the
proceedings.
Surely the point is that our system of justice is based upon trial by one's
peers with the decisions based upon those peers' interpretation of what
constitutes proper and decent behaviour and or representation?
The legal profession does indeed seem to have a distorted notion as to the
ability of people 'lesser' than they to comprehend complicated concepts.
Surely it can be seen that parallels can sometimes be used to illustrate
particularly difficult points in order to retain comprehension?
At the end of the day what matters is, surely, that the correct verdict is
reached. I am sure that the qualification of 'beyond reasonable doubt' is
always met and, of course, allows a benefit to the accused which is central
to our legal system.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Letter: Shareholders are owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MAURICE GILLIBRAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Through your columns may I urge shareholders to reject the views of Sir
Owen Green, reported in the Financial Times, that shareholders should not be
considered as owners of the business ('BTR chief defends corporate
leadership', February 27). This seems to be nothing more than yet another
plea to leave management unfettered in the conduct of the business. With the
memory of the unrestrained action of directors in Guinness, Polly Peck and
Maxwell Communications still fresh, I would hope that shareholders will
unreservedly reject such ideas.
Interestingly, Sir Owen's views may not indeed be in the interests of
management. Checks and balances on executive action are an essential feature
of any successful organisation and in their absence executive power
eventually exceeds acceptable limits. The consequences are either a demand
for greater regulation or that resort has to be made to the law to resolve
an issue.
The alternative to statutory regulation is an improved relationship between
management and shareholders. This can only be achieved within the reality
that the shareholders, having provided the capital, are thereby in effect
the owners of the business.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Letter: BR better than the pre-war 'golden age' of trains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GORDON HAFTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, What an excellent article in the Weekend FT ('The golden age of rail
that never was', February 29) by Richard Tomkins. One fears, however, that
it will have no effect on those Tories whose minds are already made up, and
convinced that privatisation will provide all the cures that are needed.
However, Mr Tomkins might have made his story even more telling had he said
something about the strides that have been made since 1948, not because of
nationalisation, but because of the immensely higher level of technical and
engineering skill that is now available to all transport undertakings.
Three hours fifty-nine minutes to Edinburgh from London (often in practice
barely three hours fifty-five for the two best trains each way, and four and
a half for most of the rest), a train every hour for most of the day
compared with three day trains and two or three night trains except for the
high season before the war, all in air-conditioned comfort and considerable
silence, make current rail travel a world better than the noisy and draughty
trains l travelled in as a child.
Unless specially prepared for a speed stunt, those trains would have rattled
themselves to bits if asked to travel at 125mph on daily rosters exceeding
1,000 miles. It is fairly easy to keep a train clean if it does one return
trip from London to Dover in a day - for example, The Golden Arrow (160
miles).
Would anyone in the 'golden age' have considered commuting from Bath,
Peterborough or Derby to London and being at their desk by 8.30? They can
and do now, which is why so many have ample opportunity to chronicle BR's
shortcomings.
Few other businesses have to manage their affairs in the public eye to the
extent that transport does.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Letter: Why the banks may live to regret their approach to
customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DEREK DOBSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I note with interest Barclays Bank chairman Sir John Quinton's comment
('Barclays falls 30% to Pounds 533m', February 27) that individual managers
might be wary of lending, even to sound customers. As an accountant dealing
with individuals on a daily basis, I am continually being bombarded with
criticisms of the way banks treat their customers - astronomic and sometimes
incorrect charges, refusal to entertain even small loan requests, excessive
interest rates, and so on.
One would think that banks, by their very nature, would have a more
business-like and sensible view of the way in which they treat their
customers. Are they so blind that they cannot see the tremendous outflow of
goodwill that is taking place? It is at times like this that most people are
in need of help and understanding from their bank; instead, all they are
getting is an unsympathetic attitude and a sad deterioration in the standard
of service.
My heart does, however, go out to the general staff who are caught in the
cross-fire of senior management instructions and customers' complaints. No
wonder their morale is at an all-time low.
I am not suggesting that the banks should lend without careful consideration
of the facts involved, but reasonable charges combined with a more
understanding and considerate approach would go a long way to retaining the
goodwill of their customers. It also hardly seems fair that the man in the
street should pay for the enormous bad debts incurred in recent years
through poor decisions made by the banks.
The banks could well regret their current approach to a problem which
affects us all. Many will not forget that when they looked for help at a
time when it was needed were simply told: 'Sorry, can't help. Have you tried
the building society down the road?' Perhaps they will.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Fairy godmother for Cinderella projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK medical research looks set to be the chief beneficiary of yesterday's
announcement by the Wellcome Trust that it is to reduce its holding of
Wellcome shares and invest in a higher-yielding portfolio.
The Wellcome Trust will this year disburse more than Pounds 100m in grants
to other bodies for biomedical research. By selling a further tranche of
shares in Wellcome, the Trust should be able to double this amount. In the
UK, its support for researchers is almost half the level provided by the
government-funded Medical Research Council (MRC).
Created under the will of Sir Henry Wellcome (1853-1936), the Trust's aim is
to advance knowledge in the biomedical sciences and the history of medicine
'which may conduce to the improvement of the physical conditions of
mankind'.
The Wellcome Trust has had its share of success in headline-catching
scientific projects:
the first study in the UK into what turned out to be Aids. More recently,
Wellcome Trust-funded researchers have been at the forefront of analysing
how Aids avoids destruction by the body's immune system.
new information on the causes of spongiform encephalopathy ('mad cow
disease').
results which explain how genetic make-up leads to asthma and related
conditions running in families.
techniques to assist the survival of premature babies.
The Trust has prided itself on funding 'Cinderella' areas of research which
find it hard to attract support from other sources. These have included
mental health, skin disease, vision and tropical medicine.
Research on treatment for malaria is one example of the latter. As a disease
which affects people in poorer countries, such research is often not a
commercial proposition for the pharmaceuticals companies.
The Trust has also supported epidemiology - the study of the causes and
distribution of diseases - normally a sideline for public health workers or
hospital clinicians.
'By providing an opportunity to concentrate on epidemiology, the Wellcome
Trust has changed the field,' says Professor Michael Marmot of the London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Health. 'It filled a gap no one else was
prepared to fill.'
With a squeeze on government funds available through the MRC, charities like
the Wellcome Trust, the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) and the Cancer
Research Campaign have come to play an increasingly important role in
biomedical research in the UK.
Sir Walter Bodmer, director of the ICRF, says 'the Trust has become a major
force and the additional income will provide a tremendous boost to British
research'.
Some of the new income will be put into developing centres of excellence
which can keep top researchers in the UK and attract back those who have
gone abroad in search of better-funded facilities. Three are already in
place in Glasgow, Cambridge and Imperial College, London.
Ms Bridget Ogilvie, the Trust's forthright Australian-born director, is also
keen to offer a better career structure to good researchers, to provide a
stable environment within which they can pursue creative research.
'We need full-time, or almost full-time, posts if we are to keep able people
in UK scientific research.'
Above all, increasing funds are needed to keep up with the rising cost of
medical research. With new techniques revolutionising medical research and
practice, there is plenty for the Trust to spend the extra income on.

If one judges merchant banking boutiques by the glitter of the names, one
would find it hard to beat the newly formed J Rothschild, Wolfensohn &amp; Co.
Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, will be
chairman, and Lord Rothschild, Jim Wolfensohn and Sir Mark Weinberg will be
on the board. All it needs is Sir Jimmy Goldsmith's name on the letterhead
and it would be hard to better the boardroom connections.
That said, the Transatlantic combination is slightly odd. What have Lord
Rothschild, 55, and Jim Wolfensohn, 58, got in common? Although both men are
regarded by some as establishment figures, they are also outsiders.
Australian-born Wolfensohn made his mark in the US after he missed out on
the top job at Schroders. Lord Rothschild is remembered for his takeover
tilt at BAT Industries rather than his impressive merchant banking career.
Wolfensohn has acted purely as an adviser, unhindered by conflicts of
interest, whereas Lord Rothschild has often acted as a principal in
transactions. Interesting to see whether the proposed combination lives up
to its early promise, given the inbuilt tensions.

The wave of austerity sweeping through the French economy has hit even that
bastion of sybaritism and self-indulgence, the Michelin guide to France.
Usually, the Michelin judges bring themselves to bestow their coveted three
stars on at least one new restaurant each year. In 1990 two restaurants were
selected, but last year it was down to one. Now, in the 1992 gastronomy
bible, not only are there no new nominations, but 56 establishments have
been demoted.
The inspectors have, however, not been entirely parsimonious; six
restaurants have been deemed worthy of two stars. These include La
Pyramide at Vienne in Isere, where Patrick Henriroux is following in the
footsteps of Fernard Point, one of the great French chefs, and L'Oasis at La
Napoule in the Alpes-Maritime, which made its name under one of Point's
proteges, and has now won its two stars thanks to Stephane Raimbault.
Visiting gourmets may, however, rest assured that the 19 three-star
restaurants have clung on to their stars. They may also be fairly confident
that a meal partaken at any of them will cost an arm and a leg.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When David Welch, the new boss of the Royal Parks department, was Aberdeen's
director of leisure and recreation, he was such a dab hand at rose-growing
that the British Tourist Authority had to exclude Aberdeen from its Britain
in Bloom competition every three years so that somewhere else could win.
The Royal parks are not likely to be as generous as Aberdeen in the
provision of roses - Welch's workers transformed the sides, central
reservation and roundabouts of the city's inner ring road into rosebeds,
doggedly replanting as local people borrowed the plants for their own use.
Demand from Aberdonian gardeners eventually reached saturation point, and
Aberdeen's rose bushes are now flourishing uninterruptedly.
Welch is remembered as energetic and innovative in overhauling the old city
parks department - and was adept at exploiting job creation programmes to
turn eyesores into flowerbeds. When the city's winter gardens appeared in
the UK's top 10 visitor attractions, Aberdonians suggested that David Welch
had hired a team of YTS trainees to spend a year walking through the
turnstiles. Sounds like Environment Secretary Michael Heseltine has picked a
man after his own heart.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Observer: Civil servants' nuclear family
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is John Guinness, the permanent secretary at the department of energy,
having second thoughts about his decision to throw in his civil service
career? After all, if Labour forms the next government, his department will
not be axed and the chairmanship of British Nuclear Fuels may not be such an
attractive number despite the prospect of a doubling in salary.
Sir Christopher Harding, BNFL's 52-year-old chairman, was due to step down
at the end of this month but is hanging on until his successor, the
56-year-old Guinness, arrives. If the Tories are re-elected, it is expected
that the 900-strong energy department will merge seamlessly into the DTI,
since Guinness has done such a good job overseeing the sale of most of the
state energy sector except for coal.
The official line is that the softly spoken Guinness is staying on until the
general election in order to provide some continuity. John Wakeham, the
energy secretary, is leaving politics and his two parliamentary
under-secretaries are relatively inexperienced.
If the Tories lose the election, and Labour's Frank Dobson breathes new life
into the energy department, it would not be surprising if he wished to
replace the architect of most major energy privatisations.
That said, there is a worry that BNFL is replacing a very commercial
chairman and one with a prodigious appetite for public relations with an
ex-civil servant whose only private sector experience was a brief stint as a
trainee at Union Discount, 30 years ago, and whose pr skills are, to put it
kindly, untested.
Since BNFL remains, like the rest of Britain's nuclear power industry, stuck
in the public sector, it is even possible that Dobson will not want a man
like Guinness running Sellafield.
Guinness's nightmare must be that he somehow gets caught between chairs when
the music stops after a Labour election victory. He is, however, too shrewd
a political operator not to have spotted that one.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Soft on soft commissions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABOLITION of fixed commissions in London's Big Bang in 1986 was widely
expected to put an end to much of the non-price competition that prevailed
in the old stockbrokers' cartel. Yet research of mixed quality, for which no
explicit price is charged, continues to pour out of securities firms in the
City. And the practice of paying soft commissions, whereby broking firms
receive an agreed amount of commission business from fund managers in
exchange for dealing screens or other investment services, has multiplied to
the point where it poses a serious regulatory challenge.
A recent survey by Greenwich Associates of 164 institutional investors
revealed that the number of institutions doing soft commission business rose
from 42 per cent to 52 per cent between 1989 and 1990. The London Stock
Exchange estimates that soft commission business accounts for 13 per cent of
total commissions. The exchange's chief executive, Mr Peter Rawlins,
declared last week that he would be happier if brokers discontinued the
practice without outside prompting.
This is unlikely to happen, because soft commissions are a marketing device
with obvious attractions for the broking fraternity at a time of excess
capacity. Brokers are, in effect, offering a discount to their fund
management clients in the form of a benefit in kind. The attraction for the
broking firm is that it acquires an agreed volume of business, in exchange
for providing Reuters screens, research or performance measurement services
for the client. The attraction for the fund manager is that the cost of
these services falls automatically on the ultimate saver, to whose fund the
commissions are charged, instead of resulting in a cash charge on his own
budget.
First question
The first question for the regulators is whether the economics of soft
commissions offer benefits to the saver. In any competitive business,
discounts are normally passed on to the ultimate customer. The growth in
soft commission business has not obviously led to this happening, despite
the considerable competition between fund management firms. But nor is it
clear that the brokers are making hay. Few London securities firms are
earning an adequate return on their capital in an overstocked market. Those
that engage in soft commissions argue that without them they would have to
raise the explicit charge to fund trustees.
The second question concerns potential conflicts of interest. Here the
problem arises because the broker is offering benefits in kind not to the
saver, but to the fund management intermediary. The Securities and
Investments Board (SIB) has already banned the offer of inducements which
are have no direct investment benefit for the customer. The worry is that by
locking themselves into soft commission deals with a specific broker, fund
managers will not obtain best execution and may be tempted to churn
portfolios to satisfy soft commission arrangements. The lack of transparency
opens the door to cross-subsidies and inefficiencies in the system.
Classic weapon
The SIB's answer has been to adopt the classic weapon of disclosure. Fund
managers now have to reveal the basis on which they deal to the trustees of
the funds they handle. Some even advertise the fact that they do no soft
commission business to win competitive advantage. And performance
measurement provides a discipline of sorts over excessive transaction costs.
Yet soft commissions continue to proliferate; and this must partly reflect
on the competence and motivation of trustees. Influential trustees such as
company finance directors or local authority treasurers tend not to like
explicit charges. Nor is it easy for them to police fund managers to ensure
best execution. The suspicion remains that this is another City practice
that offers greater benefit to intermediaries than savers.
The cost of an outright ban would be the loss of some specialist research
firms. But the City's image, much tarnished of late, is not helped by such
murky practices. The SIB should think again.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Arts: Sallinen's 'Kullervo' - Los Angeles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kullervo is Aulis Sallinen's fourth opera. Since in their different ways his
previous three - The Horseman (1974), The Red Line (1979), The King Goes
Forth to France (Savonlinna 1984, Covent Garden 1987) - rank among the most
striking additions to the medium in the postwar period, their successor was
impatiently awaited.
It was written (between 1986 and 1988) to open the new Helsinki opera house.
As, however, that momentous date in Finnish cultural history has been
continually postponed by construction problems on site, the Finnish National
Opera finally decided to give the first four Kullervo performances (from
February 25) at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles Music
Center.
By chance, this was the first-ever operatic premiere at the Center.
Production (by Kalle Holmberg), conductor (Ulf Soderblom, company
principal), cast of 13 - led by the internationally renowned baritone Jorma
Hynninen - and chorus were all Finnish National visitors. The excellent Los
Angeles Chamber Orchestra was the only local element.
The miracle of the modern Finnish opera boom is a topic already more than
once discussed on this page; the existence of this work and the quality of
its first interpreters demonstrate that it continues undimmed. Opening
night, altogether an exciting occasion, offered a superbly confident and
disciplined ensemble performance, with absolutely none of the usual premiere
problems. While hardly relieved in the brutality of its subject matter,
Kullervo - in two acts, lasting nearly three hours, for large forces
(including synthesiser) - is lit with counteracting flares of lyric
tenderness and farcical irony, and grandly achieved: a modern operatic epic
based on folk legend that proves to have alarming resonances for our own
day.
The source of the libretto, which Sallinen wrote himself, is the Kalevala,
the epic folk-poem which since first collection and publication (in 1835)
has inspired countless Finnish writers, painters and composers, Sibelius at
their head. Sallinen drew on Cantos 31-36, for general inspiration and also
for choral passages of direct quotation; but he also took the play Kullervo
by the 19th-century dramatist Aleksis Kivi as a model for his expansion and
sometimes free treatment of the subject.
To judge from the English translation, the libretto is an inspired
combination of dramatic directness and economy. Against a background of
violence almost unabated, the figure of Kullervo - clan-leader's son become
slave, murderer, unwitting incest-practiser, and finally warlord and
arsonist - stands as focal point of the poem's, and the opera's, tragic
pessimism.
The feud between his father Kalervo and uncle Unto, which frames his youth
in hideous acts of destruction and which he settles at the end, forms the
foundation on which the narrative structure rests; the main theme - the
causal connection between a violent society and a violent individual - is
elaborated in the succession of scenes and episodes. Love, of Kullervo's
mother for her son, of Kullervo and his youthful friend Kimmo, tempers the
bleakness but not the inevitability of the 'forza del destino' which renders
Kullervo something of a cross between Oedipus and Verdi's Alvaro.
In two long acts Sallinen concentrates with mature authority on telling the
tale, not underlining the 'relevance' of the message: he leaves that to
emerge of its own accord, which it does with a baleful thrust. (The critic
of the Los Angeles Times wondered what it all had to do with the host city;
others alert to parallels with the city's gang-war epidemic saw the point
without difficulty.)
Sallinen's idiom, variously indebted to Sibelius, Shostakovich, Prokofiev,
Britten and Strauss yet entirely 'personal' in its linguistic command, will
once again disconcert the modernists. He makes simple devices work wonders
across large spans of theatrical time - long-held pedal points, sequential
repetitions, unison lines of voices and instruments, a constant dramatic
punctuation with percussion, lyrical phrases almost absurdly effective in
their shape and placement.
This opera is at root a theatrical ballad, using voices to carry the drama
and instruments to provide the subcutaneous commentary - a conception of the
medium perhaps old-fashioned (at least to some) but made potently modern,
and tinglingly dramatic, by the accuracy and security of Sallinen's
theatrical instincts. He appears to me to share with Poulenc, a composer
otherwise so utterly different in approach, personality, and range, the
ability to deploy 'received' material in unexpected ways. A pseudo-catchy
air for a Blind Singer at the start of Act 2 is the single possibly
ill-judged episode; for the rest, the power accrues unremittingly.
Holmberg's production, in a mixture of modern and ancient dress set within a
bleak grey concrete frame, steers clear of folkishness. At times the
constant movement of characters on and off stage seemed quirky; on the whole
the staging built up an explosive intensity, which was discharged most
vigorously in the choral singing and in too many exactly focussed
character-cameos to list here. Three outstanding principals deserve at least
brief mention: the sappy, sweet-toned Kimmo of Jorma Silvasti, the achingly
poignant Mother of Eeva-Liisa Saarinen and the great Hynninen (a singer
regularly heard in every leading opera-theatre except Covent Garden - why?)
as Kullervo.
This last strikes me as one of the supreme performances of recent years:
embodied with lean, hard, deeply troubled stillness and sung in tones
darkened since the days of The Red Line but still matchlessly full, free and
beautiful. How marvellous it would be if a way could be found for Finnish
National Opera to pay London a visit, their first for a decade, with the
express purpose of showing off this important new work and its magnificent
leading man.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Arts: English influences on Van Gogh - Exhibition at the
Barbican
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the July of 1890, at Auvers, a little to the north of Paris, Vincent van
Gogh died at the age of 37, art's most poignant suicide. The circumstances
of his death has been well rehearsed in the several splendid exhibitions
that marked the centenary - most notably the full retrospectives of the
drawings and paintings at Otterlo and Amsterdam. But they were concentrated
upon the working life, that last extraordinary decade from 1880, when
Vincent discovered his true vocation as an artist and began to draw in
earnest.
The seeds of that vocation, however, had been sown several years before. The
earnest young man in his twenties may have been uncertain in his ambitions,
yet he had already found in art a vehicle for a volatile temperament that
was a mixture of religious feeling and enthusiasm, a transcendental love of
nature, and a missionary zeal. In this early period he was already drawing
occasionally, and within these tentative beginnings the familiar insistent
vision is already evident. But it was through looking at art, old masters
and contemporary alike, that his feelings first began to resolve themselves.
What gives this preliminary phase its peculiar interest for us is that so
important a part of it was passed in London, and that it should be the
English painting and literature of the time that impressed him so
profoundly. It is these English circumstances and context that the current
exhibition at the Barbican Art Gallery addresses. Van Gogh in England:
portrait of the artist as a young man (until May 4: sponsored by Akzo) is by
no means exhaustive, but it gives us in detail, in letters and archive
material, the successive shifts and developments in Vincent's early career,
his responses to the places he visited, the experiences he had had and the
things he had seen.
In May 1873, the 20-year-old Vincent started work at the London gallery of
Goupil's, the picture dealers of Brussels and the Hague. Early in 1876 he
turned to teaching, taking up a job at Ramsgate in April. In July he moved
on to a school at Isleworth in Middlesex, run by a Congregational minister,
the Rev Thomas Slade-Jones. Through that late summer and autumn his
religious interests intensified and he began to speak and preach at various
non-conformist churches in the neighbourhood - not altogether surprisingly,
for he was the son of a pastor in the Dutch Reformed Church. It was to be
the eventual failure of this vocation for the ministry that lead to his
first breakdown, and so to his becoming an artist. At the end of 1876 he and
his sister Anna, who had also been teaching in England, went home to Holland
for Christmas. The family persuaded him not to return.
Against the backdrop of this human story, the attention of the exhibition
rests upon Vincent's interest in the academic social realism current in
England at the time, commanding the summer show at the Royal Academy each
year and more widely disseminated in the popular illustrated magazines such
as The Graphic and the Illustrated London News. The reproductions of the
work of Herkomer, Holl and Fildes, and illustrators of Dickens such as
Mahoney, he cut out and kept. The direct borrowings he are convincingly
demonstrated: poses noticed in an anonymous Graphic illustration of 1874, of
Russian sledge-drivers in a tea-house, serve some 11 years later for the
principal figures of his great polemical composition, 'The Potato Eaters'.
Luke Fildes' Graphic drawing of 1870, of Charles Dickens' chair left empty
at his death, is clearly now the model for the two empty chairs of 1888: his
own, and that which Gauguin had but lately left.
If for too long it was the received wisdom to dismiss as marginal Vincent's
interest even in the French symbolists, Millet and Puvis de Chavannes - or
his compatriots of the Hague School, such as Jacob Maris, Josef Israels or
his own cousin-by-marriage, Anton Mauve - by how much more of the same token
does that English influence remain problematical.
Those Dutch and French influences have now been sanctioned by more recent
study and critical revision, and their effect upon Vincent at least
admitted; the English work, by contrast, is allowed the justification of its
narrative and content only in the context of socio-political analysis. To
admit as art what is routinely dismissed, as I read only last week in the
matter of some of the Tate's rehung Victorians, as work of mind-numbing
awfulness, is quite another matter.
Yet Vincent loved it, and continued to respond to it throughout his life. He
greatly admired Millais, and only now are we beginning to accept that the
later Millais was at least as fine and interesting a painter as the young
pre-Raphaelite. He was also interested in the work of the French expatriate,
James Tissot, so long discounted as a mere observer of elegant society. But
von Herkome, Holl and Fildes, and even so minor a figure as James Boughton,
he also accepted for what they were. We need not rate them over high to
recognise the inherent value of a great artist's interest.
No artist works out of his time, indifferent to the attitudes and
assumptions that inform it. He may challenge them, but to challenge them is
to know and recognise them. Vincent never had any difficulty with the
narrative and symbolic content of art, with the moral purpose that in the
20th century we have found so hard to accept. And if we begin to recognise
that his own art throughout, every last bit of it, was instinct with such
acceptance, so as much might be true of Gauguin, Pissarro, Lautrec - then
Roger Fry's old exclusive heresy of significant form soon begins to fall
away. It would be no bad thing were we able once more to look at narrative
art for what it is, and accept it for the art it is.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Arts: Ten years old today - A look at the Barbican on its
anniversary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Barbican arts centre celebrates its tenth anniversary today. Only ten
years] The grey monolith, looming unexpectedly on the City landscape like
some sinister battle cruiser, seems to have existed for ever. And, like a
battle cruiser, it is taking ages for it to change direction, moving from
loss to profit, from an object of derision to an old friend, from an
artistic problem to an artistic joy.
It was the last manifestation of brutalist architecture, a decade or more
behind the times when it opened. Its captains, Henry Wrong, who spent most
of his working life on a building site, and, since 1990, Baroness O'Cathain,
have struggled manfully to make it more loveable. Never can an arts centre
have lived and died so much by its appearance rather than by the activities
taking place inside. For once you have penetrated one of the 100 or more
access points that the architects devised instead of a recognisable main
entrance, the Barbican as a performance place - apart from a (much improved)
dodgy acoustic in the concert hall - has mainly been a delight.
Of course the artists have played up. First the resident orchestra, the
London Symphony, went on a wallet breaking learning curve to discover that
its challenging seasons of Tippett and Webern and its repeated concerts in
blocks of intense monthly playing, were not what the audience wanted. There
was a nasty cash crisis seven years ago. Now the corner has been turned and
the LSO is on a high, with record attendances of 85 per cent this season and
with the Arts Council and the City happily throwing extra money at it to
expand its size and widen its repertoire with new commissions.
Then the RSC went sulky, despite the fact that the main theatre and the
experimental dungeon space, the Pit, were designed to the scenarios of its
successive directors Peter Hall and Trevor Nunn. Once again poor programming
produced a crippling deficit. Now the RSC has been placated, with more money
and more affection. Its new management team gets on much better with Detta
O'Cathain; the moans over backstage facilities have resulted in the current
refit; and director Adrian Noble is so positive about the Barbican that he
is for the first time premiering the big production of his 1992 season -
Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet - at the Barbican rather than at Stratford.
Hamlet provides one of the first examples of what the Barbican was designed
to promote but singularly failed to deliver - a comprehensive artistic
experience - musical, dramatic, and, in the gallery, artistic, to
demonstrate the universal interweaving of the arts. The three residents have
rarely co-operated on joint ventures. There are genuine problems - two or
three year lead times in planning the music programme as against a year for
the theatre, for example - but with a will more could have been achieved.
But this autumn a Scandinavian Festival will put Sibelius alongside Hamlet,
with the gallery exhibiting north European romantic paintings.
Perhaps the biggest change in the fortunes of the Barbican has been the
rallying round of the City. At first it was critical (with some reason since
its expenditure on the project had spiralled from Pounds 8m to Pounds 190m),
but now it is proud to be the third largest benefactor of the arts in the UK
after the Arts Council and the BBC. The City gives the Barbican Pounds 30m a
year to cover its capital and maintenance costs and it is currently prepared
to put in a little extra to help eliminate the Pounds 2m shortfall. This
shortfall has proved stubbornly unmovable, thanks to the recession which has
wiped Pounds 300,000 from the sponsorship target, cut bookings of
conferences and exhibitions, created more dark nights, and reduced
audiences, mainly for run-of-the-mill events although even the Messiah
failed to sell out last Christmas.
How to fill the concert hall when the LSO, which promotes 85 performances
there a year, is absent, remains the key problem for Detta O'Cathain. Her
revenue comes mainly from catering, bars, and parking and her aim is to
boost attendances from the current 73 per cent to 85 per cent, and no dark
nights. To a great extent she relies on outside producers, like Raymond
Gubbay, who on Wednesday puts on his 1000th show at the Barbican, to
populate the place. But many of his competitors have withdrawn and the
Barbican has been forced to increase its own promotions from under 20 to
approaching 70 a year.
Like its rival on the South Bank it is trying to give form to its activities
by creating themes and seasons. So a series by the Academy of St Martins, a
light entertainment festival, and one devoted to operatic classics, are
pencilled in. The City is investing more in such promotions, both to raise
quality and to avoid nights when the Barbican feels forced to accept a
bizarre booking from some egotistic eccentric. On the other hand Detta
O'Cathain is 'quite prepared to listen to our customers' and if a company
wants a concert to entertain its staff or customers the Barbican will tailor
one for you.
With the artistic programme at last coming together Detta O'Cathain can
concentrate on the building. Soon a design company delivers its solution to
the crucial problem of signposting, both to, and inside, the Barbican. The
catering has already been improved. The retail spaces are to be franchised
out and the car parks rationalised.
But the big event, scheduled for 1993, is the creation of an entrance to the
Barbican. The architects expected everyone to arrive by car down a ramp
underground. Lack of a natural focus has probably caused more people to
arrive disgruntled than any other factor. Once again the City is digging
into its pockets for Pounds 2m to pay for the entrance.
Even before the building is finally made habitable Detta O'Cathain is
asserting her will. She is like a landlady trying to smarten up a property
occupied by controlled tenants. She might warn the RSC that Dr Jekyll and Mr
Hyde was an unseasonal Christmas show but she could not dissuade it from
making the mistake. She has had better luck convincing Adrian Noble that Two
Gentlemen of Verona should transfer to the main stage rather than descend to
the Pit. Where she has power she wields it  - the cinema has moved into the
exhibition business, acquiring the British rights to Pavarotti's film of
Rigoletto: it covered its cost at the Barbican and can now make a profit for
five years. She hopes to take the Barbican art gallery, another tenant,
under direct control. It is all proving slow progress but in another ten
years the Barbican could be loved, rather than , as now, just accepted.

The series-within-a-series, 'J'accuse' in the C4 arts slot Without Walls
(9.00) is one of television's most valuable innovations for years. For too
long television's arts budgets have concentrated almost exclusively on
panegyrics and hagiography. In 'J'accuse' somebody gets the opportunity to
challenge the consensus on one of our cultural gods. Today Russell Davies
tackles the inflated reputation of Laurence Olivier.
In words that bring to mind the famous radio series presented by Edgar
Lustgarten, today's incident in ITV's Murder Squad (9.00) is described as
'one of the strangest cases in the history of the Metropolitan Police'. It
began with the disappearance of a seven year old boy who should have been
collected by his guardian after school in December 1989. Tony Slattery is
developing a splendid hate figure in Terence Frisby's superior comedy That's
Love: a marriage guidance counsellor who is busy seducing the wife in the

FT  03 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: Sale of gardener's cottage is taxed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEWIS v ROOK Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Balcombe, Lord Justice Ralph
Gibson, and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith): February 19 1992. A GARDENER'S
cottage owned by a taxpayer, situated not very closely adjacent to her main
house on the opposite boundary of her estate, is not part of those buildings
which constitute the dwelling house, and is therefore subject to capital
gains tax on sale by the taxpayer.
The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by the Inland Revenue
from Mr Justice Mervyn Davies's decision affirming a decision by General
Commissioners that the taxpayer, Lady Rook, was entitled to relief from
capital gains tax on the disposal of a cottage on the boundary of her
residential property.
LORD JUSTICE BALCOMBE said that on June 6 1968, Lady Rook purchased
Newlands, Crockham Hill, Kent for Pounds 34,501.
Included in the purchase were two cottages known as Nos 1 and 2 Hop Cottages
on the south boundary of the property. The total acreage of the property was
10.5 acres. The distance between No 1 Hop Cottages and Newlands was 175
metres.
In February 1974, Lady Rook's gardener moved into No 1 Hop Cottages. In
February 1978, he vacated No 1.
On August 30 1979, Lady Rook sold No 1 for Pounds 33,000. The sale proceeds
helped to finance the conversion into residential accommodation of the coach
house adjacent to the main house.
The gardener moved into the coach house. Lady Rook was elderly, lived alone
in the main house and needed someone close at hand; hence the reason for his
move.
The greenhouses, tool shed and compost heaps used in connection with the
main house garden were situated between the main house and No 1 Hop
Cottages. During Lady Rook's ownership of it, No 1 had never been screened
from the main house so that she could see the lights in the cottage and
flash a light if she needed help. She also had a ship's bell which could be
heard from the cottage if she needed help. That had happened more than once.
Section 102(1) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979 provided that a gain on
disposal of a dwelling house was not chargeable to tax 'if the dwelling
house or part of a dwelling-house has been the individual's only or main
residence throughout the period of ownership . . .'.
The General Commissioners found that No 1 Hop Cottages formed part of the
entity which comprised the dwelling-house of Newlands.
Mr Justice Mervyn Davies upheld the Commissioners' findings.
He concluded that the entity constituting Lady Rook's residence included No
1 Hop Cottages, because her way of living embraced the use not only of
Newlands House itself with its gardens, but also of the cottage of the
gardener who attended to the gardens.
That the cottage was about 190 yards distant from the house was, to his
mind, not of paramount importance in the context of the Newlands set-up. He
said it was a matter of degree.
The Crown maintained that no reasonable tribunal of fact could have reached
the conclusion that No 1 Hop Cottages and Newlands together formed one
dwelling-house which was the taxpayer's residence.
In Batey v Wakefield (1981) 55 TC 550, the main house ('Paddocks') was set
in 1.1 acres of land. On part of that land the taxpayer built a chalet
bungalow for occupation by a caretaker/gardener. It was separated from
Paddocks by the width of a tennis court and a little more.
Mr Justice Browne-Wilkinson said: 'difference between the two sides depends
on whether one stresses the words 'a dwelling-house', as the Crown suggest,
or the words 'a residence', as the taxpayer suggests. In the ordinary use of
the words, if one looks at a man's residence it includes not only the
physical main building but also the appurtenant buildings.'
He said the lodge was occupied by the taxpayer through his employee, who was
employed for the purpose of promoting the taxpayer's reasonable enjoyment of
his own residence; and 'bearing in mind the fact that the buildings are very
closely adjacent', it was proper to find that the lodge was part of the
taxpayer's residence.
Lord Justice Fox said there was no difference in principle between a
coachman's flat in the stable yard used to serve the main house and a
bungalow built on the comparatively small area of land held with Paddocks,
for the purpose of serving Paddocks. He said it was 'a question of degree in
each case', whether a separate building formed part of the residence.
In Markey v Sanders (1987) 60 TC 245, Mr Justice Walton said the conditions
that had to be satisfied were first, occupation of the building must
increase the taxpayer's enjoyment of the main house; and second the other
building must be 'very closely adjacent' to the main building'.
In Williams v Merrylees (1987) 60 TC 297, a lodge some 200 metres from the
main house was held by the General Commissioners to be part of a
dwelling-house which was the taxpayer's residence, being 'within the
curtilage of the property of and appurtenant to' the main house. An appeal
by the Crown was dismissed.
The current state of the authorities was not very satisfactory. It was
necessary to go back to the words of the statute.
What had first to be determined was what, in the particular case,
constituted the 'dwelling-house'.
That was an ordinary English word of which the definition in the shorter
Oxford English Dictionary was 'a house occupied as a place of residence'.
That dwelling-house could consist of more than one building even if the
other building itself constituted a separate dwelling house (Batey v
Wakefield). Nevertheless, 'what one is looking for is an entity which can be
sensibly described as a dwelling-house though split up into different
buildings performing different functions' (Williams v Merrylees).
How, then, could that entity be identified in any given case?
First, attention must be focused on the dwelling-house which was said to
constitute the entity. In so far as some of the statements made in Batey v
Wakefield suggested that one must first identify the residence, they were
made per incuriam (inaccurate).
Where it was contended that one or more separate buildings were to be
treated as part of an entity which, together with the main house, comprised
a dwelling-house, Mr Warren submitted that no building could form part of a
dwelling-house which included a main house, unless that building was
appurtenant to and within the curtilage of the main house.
That was a helpful approach, since it involved the application of
well-recognised legal concepts.
In Methuen Campbell v Walkers (1979) QB 525,543, Lord Justice Buckley said:
'For one corporeal hereditament to fall within the curtilage of another, the
former must be so intimately associated with the latter as to lead to the
conclusion that the former in truth forms part and parcel of the latter . .
. How far it is appropriate to regard this identity as parts of one messuage
or parcel of land as extending must depend on the character and
circumstances of the items under consideration.'
That passage was cited with approval by all members of the Court of Appeal
in Dyer v Dorset County Council (1989) QB 346, all of whom emphasised the
smallness of the area comprised in the curtilage. That coincided with the
close proximity test, 'very closely adjacent', in Batey and Markey.
If the Commissioners in the present case had applied the right test: 'Was
the Cottage within the curtilage of, and appurtenant to, Newlands, so as to
be a part of the entity which, together with Newlands, constituted the
dwelling-house occupied by the taxpayer as her residence?' - they could not
have reached the decision they did.
The cottage was 175 metres from Newlands. Newlands was on the northern
boundary and the cottage on the southern boundary of a 10.5 acre estate. And
they were separated by a large garden with no intervening buildings other
than the greenhouses and tool shed.
Those facts led to the inescapable conclusion that the cottage was not
within the curtilage of and appurtenant to Newlands, and so was not part of
the entity which, together with Newlands, constituted Lady Rook's
dwelling-house.
The appeal was allowed. Their Lordships agreed.
For the Crown: Nicholas Warren (Inland Revenue solicitor).
For Lady Rook: David Milne QC (Susan H. Newlands, Dorking).

FT  03 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): The boardroom beckons -
What makes a director different from a mere manager?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They are a mixed bunch: 19 men and one woman crowded into the Institute of
Director's fourth-floor London training room for a two-day course on The
Role of the Company Director.
They have come to learn what makes becoming a director different from being
merely a manager. 'You can be a senior executive of ICI, responsible for
millions of pounds, but you don't have the same responsibilities in law as
the director of a small company,' says John Jackson, the IOD's programme
manager.
One participant has been a director for the past year of a family-owned
Midlands car dealership. Another has been invited to become a director in
two months time, while a third has insisted on attending the course as part
of his redundancy package. He is still looking for new employment.
The cultures of the companies from which they come are varied. One
family-owned group holds its board meetings over Sunday lunch. Some hold
regular monthly or quarterly meetings, but one participant, the director of
a foreign-owned company, has attended just one board meeting in nine months
and that was only because the directors involved came together 'by
accident'.
Their reasons for joining the course are equally diverse. One, a director
for the past nine months, says he wants to avoid repeating the mistakes he
feels he has already made while a second, yet to join the board, wants 'to
know what I am in for'. Another, a member of a third-generation family
company, faces competition from several siblings and wants to improve his
chances of winning a board seat.
The passing of recent legislation has made the job of being a company
director a much more serious undertaking than in the past.
The Insolvency Act and the Company Directors' Disqualification Act have
exposed even non-executive directors to considerable financial penalties and
the possibility of disqualification for up to 15 years for negligence, let
alone fraud, if they are found guilty of trading while insolvent.
It is for this reason that Henry Short, an experienced businessman and
'boardroom consultant' devotes so much time to what he calls 'legal and
general' issues. The whole of the second day of the course is given over to
an explanation of the law relating to directors.
Yet, for all the focus that recent legal changes have put on the role of the
director, the law is a poor guide to directors on how they should go about
their task.
The Companies Act for example sets down minimum standards but provides
little practical help in establishing best practice, Short explains. A
company need hold only one directors' meeting a year though this is clearly
inadequate for the running of any business.
The Memorandum and Articles of Association which companies are required to
have are also of little guidance. Most UK companies define their area of
operations very broadly in order not to exclude themselves from future
opportunities. Few directors read beyond the paragraphs relating to the
dismissal of directors, Short comments dryly.
Nor is the law much help when it comes to defining a director. John
Watkinson, a solicitor who provides the legal input for the course, falls
back on a handy aphorism provided by Sir George Jessel, a 19th century
judge.
'It does not much matter what you call them so long as you understand what
their true position is, which is that they are merely commercial men
managing a trading concern for the benefit of themselves and all other
shareholders in it.'
Most managers are flattered and excited if they are asked to become a
director but the recent legislation has made it more important than ever
that they check what they are letting themselves in for, says Short.
'You can't present the chairman with a list of questions before agreeing to
accept but you might say: 'I am flattered but it is a serious matter. Can I
discuss some matters before I give a final decision?'' he suggests.
The board is unlikely to show you the minutes of previous board meetings
before you become a director but you should be able to see an up-to-date set
of accounts.
One of the most common failings of newly-appointed directors is their
inability to rise to the broader responsibilities which come with the job,
says Short. 'It won't do to be a promoted manager, continuing the job you
were doing before.'
In management meetings, a manager should be ready to speak on his specialist
area - finance, production or marketing - but in a board meeting, a director
should be informed and able to express a view on any subject on the agenda.
Directors must also be able to take a more strategic overview of their
company while leaving the day-to-day running of the company to the managing
director. Being a director means 'knowing where you are today; deciding
where you are going tomorrow and considering who or what might stop you from
getting there', says Short.
The focus of the activities of a company's directors is the board meeting,
the style of which can determine the effectiveness of the directors'
contribution.
Short recalls one company where the chairman dominated proceedings, talking
constantly and dictating his remarks into a tape recorder.
Meetings were held in the board room with participants seated in comfortable
leather armchairs. The company secretary, clearly aware that he filled no
useful role, spent the meeting doodling while the two young managing
directors sat smoking large cigars. 'I advised them to at least sit round a
table,' says Short.
One year later they did sit round a table and the meeting was conducted in a
more businesslike way, but old habits died hard and the chairman still
dictated his comments into a Dictaphone while the company secretary doodled
abstractedly.
'So many board meetings are below par,' says Short. 'Companies should
formalise things. They should not hold meetings over lunch.'
The legislation setting tough penalties for directors has given an added
urgency to the need for careful records to be kept of board meetings.
'It's no good saying: 'I told them we were heading for trouble,'' says
Short. 'You must have your comments minuted. These cases come up two, three
or four years after the event by which time no-one can remember who said
what. The minute book is your evidence to explain your case if an insolvency
practitioner is trying to establish what went wrong.'
The second day of the course, devoted entirely to the legal aspects of being
a company director, provides a rapid, though still demanding, circuit of the
masses of legislation governing companies, their directors, employees and
contracts. 'You have added responsibilities above those of a manager,' says
Watkinson, before going on to detail the myriad instances in which directors
might fall foul of the law. An early investment in legal advice can save a
very large sum at a later date, he notes.
At the end of the two days the 20 'merely commercial men (and women)' have
been given new insights into what their role entails. They are just a
handful of the 3,000 directors who will take one of the IOD's courses this
year. But, with between 350,000 and 500,000 company directors in the UK,
raising the level of directors' competence is a mammoth task.

A 10-POINT PLAN FOR WOULD-BE COMPANY DIRECTORS:
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Before joining the board
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Establish what the job involves, your salary and reporting lines.
 2. Check that the company's financial status is sound.
 3. Obtain and study a copy of:
     The Memorandum and Articles of Association
     A draft of your service agreement if you are to be given one
 4. Get the details of any personal guarantees given by existing
    directors to the company's bankers.
 5. Obtain details of any 'directors and officers' insurance policies
    which have been taken out. Do they need to be amended to take
    account of your appointment?
 6. Obtain information, if the existing board is prepared to divulge
    it, about any pending changes in the company's situation.
 7. Make sure you have provided your written consent to act as a
    director which is now required by law.
On appointment
 8. Study the minutes of recent board meetings to see what decisions
    have been taken.
 9. Establish what are the company's strategic plans.
10. Discuss with the chairman the purpose and objectives of the board;
    what he expects from individual directors and what feedback on
    their performance they can expect from him.

<TEXT>
Four out of 10 family-owned businesses in France went out of family control
or failed in the decade up to 1990, according to a survey* by 3i, the
development capital group.
Fifty-eight per cent of the businesses which were in existence in 1980 were
still in family hands 10 years later but 25 per cent were no longer
family-controlled and 17 per cent had ceased trading. The researchers
tracked 2,460 businesses with turnover of at least FFr20m (Pounds 2.03m) in
1980.
The loss of family control was most marked among companies involved in
manufacturing and construction but less common in the food, commerce and
service sectors.
Seven out of 10 owner-managers questioned in 1990 said they wanted to hand
their company on to the next generation within the next 10 years by which
time 83 per cent of the managers would be more than 70 years old.
This wish may prove optimistic, however. Only 25 per cent of the businesses
surveyed had passed control on to the next generation in the decade up to
1990. (The remaining 33 per cent still in family hands were controlled by
the same generation in command at the start of the decade.)
Owner-managers believed the principal advantages of family control were
stronger motivation and the ability to respond quickly to events. However a
quarter thought a shortage of funds meant family control was a brake on
growth.
Twenty-three per cent of business owners envisaged selling up to another
company; 5 per cent contemplated selling to their own employees by way of a
management buy-out and 3 per cent had thought of permitting a buy-in by
outside managers.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Technology: Bitten by the bug - The computer virus that is
set to attack this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A computer virus that is set to wipe out data stored on infected personal
computers this Friday is causing widespread concern among US computer users
and manufacturers. The 'Michelangelo' virus may be the most widespread and
potentially destructive computer virus to date, according to computer
security experts.
Estimates of the number of computers that may be affected range up to 5m,
but are impossible to verify. Commentary on the virus attack is ranging from
hysterical to cynical. Some are predicting a worldwide catastrophe as
millions of computer files are destroyed.
Others view the virus scare as a marketing ploy by companies that sell
anti-virus programs and services. Whether Michelangelo turns out to be an
epidemic or isolated problem, however, there is no doubt that computer
viruses are multiplying and threatening to disrupt the free flow of
information among computers that is one of the prime benefits of the desktop
machines.
There are now about 1,000 identified viruses and at least 100 new ones have
cropped up over the past two months. The sources of most viruses are
unknown. However, this week two students at Cornell University in New York
were arrested on charges that they unleashed a computer virus that paralysed
computers in California and Japan.
The virus - known as the MBDFA virus - was launched on February 14 in three
Macintosh computer games. It infected the computers of people who accessed
the university's public computer archive to play the games.
Computers at Stanford University in California and others in Osaka, Japan
were affected. The Michelangelo virus can be contracted only by using
infected floppy disks, unlike many viruses which are spread over networks.
In the past, computer users could be reasonably sure of avoiding viruses so
long as they used only newly purchased copies of programs and did not
'borrow' copies of programs from other users.
Recently, however, viruses have infected computers at some of the largest
software publishing companies in the US and at computer hardware
manufacturers. Unwittingly some of these companies have passed the virus on
to their customers.
Among those that have discovered the scourge in time, stringent security
measures have been put in place. One of the largest suppliers of computer
networking software, for example, has created a 'clean room' environment in
its software development laboratories by requiring employees to scan all
computer disks through a virus detection system before entering.
Michelangelo is only the latest of hundreds of computer viruses to be spread
among desktop computers. According to a recent survey conducted by the US
National Computer Security Association and Dataquest, a market research
firm, 63 per cent of personal computer users have already encountered a
computer virus and 9 per cent have experienced a 'virus disaster'.
The survey covered more than 600,000 personal computers in businesses
throughout the US and Canada. Corporate personal computers are particularly
vulnerable to computer viruses, according to officials at McAfee Associates,
a California computer security firm, because they are often shared among
several users and typically run more programs than a home computer.
Already there have been several reports in the US of Michelangelo victims
who have lost valuable data when the virus activated prematurely. These have
ranged from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology to West
Coast law firms and charity groups.
Michelangelo can cause total loss of data on a personal computer hard disk
by writing over it with random characters. 'It is a digital paper shredder,'
says Martin Tibor of Synapse Data Recovery, a San Rafael, California,
company that specialises in eradicating infections.
This virus is spread on infected floppy disks. It is transferred to the
computer memory and hard disk when an attempt is made to 'boot' the computer
with the infected floppy disk in place in the drive. Once the hard disk is
infected the virus will infect every other floppy that is used in the
computer.
Several software companies offer programs that can eradicate the virus.
Users 'scan' their computers to find out if any rogue programs are lurking
in the machine's memory bank. If an infection is found, the anti-virus
program will wipe it out, but that is not the end of the story.
Typically, an infected machine will have transferred the virus to every
floppy disk that has been used on the computer. Users must, therefore,
systematically scan the machine until every floppy disk has been checked. In
a corporate setting, this can be particularly tiresome.
Tibor, who has worked on several such projects, says that it becomes
essential to search the premises for disks that people have, for example,
stashed in desk drawers. 'I usually tell employees to bring in their home
computers as well.'
They are typically infected by disks that people take home to work on, he
explains. Constant vigilance is the only sure way to avoid viruses. With new
ones cropping up all the time, it becomes necessary to update frequently
anti-virus programs, which only wipe out the viruses known at the time they
are sold. Too many computer users scan their machines once and then forget
about the problem, warns Tibor.
To deal specifically with the Michelangelo virus, several companies are
offering anti-viral software programs. Central Point Software has a
Michelangelo Protection Kit, which it is selling in the US for Dollars 29
(Pounds 16.50). Symantec is also offering a special Michelangelo edition of
its Norton anti-virus program for a nominal fee to cover shipping.
As a precautionary measure, personal computer users may also advance the
'clock' on their machines beyond Friday to try to outwit the virus program.
Past scares about viruses often have proven to be overblown. But the
unusually destructive nature of Michelangelo makes it hard to ignore.
Following the 'better safe than sorry' principle, seems to be a wise
approach.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): Calling in the brain
surgeon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These days when one personal computer is almost identical to any other built
around the same processor chip, differential marketing is what the PC
retailing business is about.
There are many ways to distinguish Joe desktop from other clones. One is by
price. Others include design, after-sales service and back-up. But an
increasingly popular option is to attach an 'upgradeable' sticker to the
machine - or more precisely to its central processor unit (CPU).
Upgradeability is not a new concept. Most ageing desktops can accommodate
more memory, a bigger hard disc and a better screen.
But making provision for a PC to have the equivalent of a brain transplant -
by swapping its CPU - is a relatively new bandwagon, and one on to which
many of the PC manufacturers are now jumping. Indeed, until relatively
recently it was arguable that processor upgradeability was simply a
fortunate by-product of efficient manufacturing.
Modular assembly, using a standard board into which different processor
chips can be plugged to produce machines with different specifications, is
often the cheapest way of manufacturing. Using this single 'motherboard'
design for a whole PC range generates volume savings and improves quality.
However, recent developments have made the arguments for built-in
upgradeability even more compelling for the customer.
First, chip prices continue to tumble as Intel manoeuvres to maintain its
dominant market position and to encourage users to climb the chip generation
ladder. This means that the price of upgrades is also dropping steadily.
Second, the chip development cycle is accelerating. There is now only a two-
to three-year gap between new generations of Intel processors - and the gap
is getting shorter.
Third, Intel will today unveil its new DX2 chips based on its 'clock doubler
technology' which enables the processor to run internally at twice its usual
speed and is designed to provide a 'mid-life' kicker initially to its 486
range, ahead of the launch of its next generation of processors, dubbed P5,
later this year. Intel will also announce its 'OverDrive' companion chip for
486SX machines which speeds up all mathematical calculations.
Although the new DX2 chips are designed principally for new machines, some
manufacturers have already said they will offer them as upgrades. Similarly,
the OverDrive chip which plugs into the vacant co-processor socket initially
in 486SX machines, will also be made available as an upgrade for DX2
machines next year.
The most obvious way a manufacturer can build in upgradeability is to
provide for the removal of the existing processor from its socket on the
motherboard. The upgrade can then be plugged in. Companies such as Viglen
and Dell, among many others, have taken this route. Usually the upgrade
package includes a special chip removing tool. The only other thing required
is a steady hand.
Another route is to mount the processor on to a smaller board, known as the
daughter board, which plugs into the motherboard. Upgrading is just a matter
of pulling one daughter board out and replacing it.
This is the route chosen by Elonex, the UK's largest direct seller of PCs.
The company does not charge a premium for its upgrades, so upgrading from a
33MHz 386DX to a 33MHz 486, for example, costs just Pounds 250.
With Intel vowing to make 1992 the year of its 80486 chip the case for
choosing a 486 machine with a guaranteed upgrade path has never been
stronger - provided there is little or no price premium.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Technology: Iron challenges the lightweights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lennart Backerud, a Swedish professor, has developed a technology which he
says introduces foundries to the computer era and opens up a wide range of
new applications for an age-old material that is cheap, abundant and readily
available from foundries worldwide: cast iron.
He suggests his process is likely to redraw the map of metal usage. In the
near term it seems likely to slow down the switch to aluminium by car
manufacturers.
SinterCast, the Swedish-American company which owns the patent, says the
process can reduce the weight of products such as car components by up to 30
per cent and cut the cost by as much as 10 per cent, yet make them as strong
as ever.
The process has just been introduced at its foundries by Fritz Winter
Eisengeiberie. This German company is one of the world's leading independent
suppliers of castings for the motor industry with annual production of more
than 200,000 tonnes.
Backerud's process permits the commercial production of a form of cast iron
called compacted graphite iron (CGI). In this form of cast iron, graphite
modules form a worm-like pattern whereas in traditional cast iron, or grey
iron, the graphite modules form flakes along which the metal can fracture.
CGI's microstructure makes it one-and-a-half to two times as strong as grey
iron, the traditional material used for casting engine blocks and cylinder
heads. That strength would allow car makers to design engines with thinner
cylinder walls and other structures, thus cutting weight.
CGI has been known about for more than 20 years but in the past it has been
produced only in laboratories. Foundries have been unable to produce it
consistently, mainly because the raw material, scrap metal, contains
impurities such as magnesium and titanium.
The core of the Backerud process is an ultra-sensitive probe which is
lowered into the molten metal before it is cast. The probe is fitted with
thermocouples which detect minuscule changes as molten metal cools and
solidifies. A computer analyses how the metal will cool and prescribes how
to fine-tune the recipe so it will unfailingly form CGI.
Ted Louckes, SinterCast's president, says that switching an engine block to
aluminium would save 50 per cent of the weight at three times the cost.
However, once it has been redesigned so that CGI can be used, 30 per cent of
the weight could be saved at the same cost or even less. 'And the foundry
capacity is already in place, no new plant and equipment is needed,' he
points out.
He reckons that in the automotive industry alone, at least 10m tonnes of
castings could usefully be switched to CGI. Louckes says CGI costs about the
same as ductile iron or 25 per cent more than grey iron. To reap the
benefits of CGI, products should be re-designed. While stronger than grey
iron, CGI's damping, thermal conductivity and machinability are similar to
or approaching those of grey iron, while its wear resistance is superior to
that of nodular iron.
Backerud says that aluminium is not particularly suitable for car engine
blocks and cylinder heads because these require high-quality aluminium - so
it is not possible to use scrap or recycled material.
SinterCast, which is based at Auburn Hills, Michigan, is taking an original
approach to selling its technology. It is offering a turn-key technical
service and provides all the probes, computers and other equipment, and all
the necessary additives, complete with a trained technician. 'We guarantee
the process. The foundry does not have to invest or worry about making the
technology work,' says Louckes.
In return, the foundry pays a previously-negotiated fee for each successful
tonne of metal. The aim is to leave a foundry with extra profit even after
paying the SinterCast fees.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Most customers find water metering satisfactory in trials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY three quarters of customers interviewed in a survey of water metering
trials throughout England have said that metering is a satisfactory method
of paying for water.
The survey covered 1,031 customers of the 57,000 households involved in
national metering trials in 12 areas over the past three years. It was
conducted by WS Atkins, the firm of management consultants, for Ofwat, the
industry's economic regulator.
Water companies need to adopt a new method of charging by the end of the
decade as the present method based on rateable values must cease by then.
Alternatives are a flat-rate licence fee or a charge based on the banding of
property by size or value.
The survey found that most customers were broadly satisfied with the way in
which the trials had been carried out. But there were some aspects they felt
could be improved, including meter location and installation.
Four out of five were satisfied with the location but would have preferred
some choice and a chance to discuss positioning with the water company.
Almost one in five households had experienced a problem with meter
operation.
One in seven households was critical of the way installation or
reinstatement work was done.
The main criticisms involved poor workmanship, delays in finishing the work
and inadequate tidying up.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat director-general, said: 'The survey has enabled me to
develop a better understanding of the viewpoint of customers who are
experiencing metering.
'The information will help me assess the water companies' detailed proposals
on arrangements for metering, including optional metering.'

FT  03 MAR 92 / Shetlanders seen to oppose separate independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHETLANDERS have little interest in seeking separate independence from
Britain if Scotland were to become independent, Mr Edward Thomason, convener
of Shetland Islands council, said yesterday.
The question has become significant because an independent Shetland could,
along with an independent Orkney, lay claim to a large part of the North Sea
oil and gas fields. If England also drove a hard bargain over the division
of oilfields in the North Sea, an independent Scottish government could end
up with less than 10 per cent of North Sea oil revenues.
Mr Thomason said there was 'no evidence of a wish for independence in the
islands'. He added: 'No one is more surprised by all this talk of separation
than the Shetlanders themselves.'
The present airing of the Shetland question comes in the latest North Sea
oil report by County NatWest WoodMac, the brokers, which looks at the
possible implications for the North Sea of an independent Scotland.
It says that the maximum North Sea oil revenues Scotland could expect over
the next five years would be Pounds 17bn in 1992 terms out of the total of
Pounds 18bn.
This assumes that the border between the English and Scottish sectors was
drawn due east from Berwick-on-Tweed. If the direction of the land border
between England and Scotland was continued into the sea and if Shetland and
Orkney took their share of the oilfields then Scottish revenue could be as
little as Pounds 1.5bn.
The report says that at a time when the North Sea is having to compete for
oil-company funds with the emerging oil and gas provinces in Africa, South
America and the former Soviet Union, oil companies need to be convinced that
they would not be 'economically disadvantaged' by any carve-up.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Business leaders prefer 'no change'
 -Scots Government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO THIRDS of Scottish business leaders want no change in Scotland's
constitutional arrangements, according to an opinion survey.
But 23 per cent would like to see some form of Scottish parliament, which
would have tax-raising powers, replacing Scotland's existing tier of
regional councils.
Euram Consulting, an executive recruitment agency, asked 515 of Scotland's
senior industrialists, top executives of financial institutions and senior
partners of law and accountancy firms to complete a postal survey.
Of the 35 per cent who replied, 65 per cent wanted no change. Two per cent
wanted a Scottish tax-raising assembly on top of the regional councils and 6
per cent wanted total independence.
Among the Scottish public as a whole, support for independence has eased and
backing for the constitutional status has risen, according to a Mori opinion
poll published at the weekend by The Sunday Times.
It put support for independence at 36 per cent, that for devolution at 37
per cent and backing for the status quo at 23 per cent.
This contrasts with an ICM poll taken at the end of January for the Scotsman
newspaper and ITN which put support for independence at 50 per cent and that
for devolution at 27 per cent, with the status quo backed by 19 per cent of
those asked.
That poll triggered intense interest in the Scottish constitutional issue
and also showed a rise in support for the Scottish National party, which
backs independence.
Backing for the SNP is now put by Mori at 25 per cent. Backing for Labour is
42 per cent, that for the Conservatives 22 per cent and that for the Liberal
Democrats 10 per cent.
A System Three poll for the Glasgow Herald taken over the same period put
Labour at 38 per cent (38 per cent in January), the SNP at 28 per cent (26),
Conservatives at 22 per cent (23) and Liberal Democrats at 10 per cent (11).

FT  03 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Prescott publishes motorists'
charter - Transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday sought to counter suggestions that it is the anti-car party
by publishing a charter for motorists.
The 31-point plan, produced after consultation with motoring organisations,
sets out proposals for giving better consumer protection to motorists and
tightening up on road safety.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said private motor cars were
'an indispensable and inescapable fact in the quality of life of millions of
people in modern Britain'.
He denied suggestions that an incoming Labour government would axe the
Department of Transport's Pounds 20bn roads programme to pay for a big
increase in spending on public transport: 'What we are talking about is a
six-month moratorium on the placing of new road-building contracts to give
us time to decide a new order of priorities.'
Labour would replace separate planning for investment in roads, railways and
air transport with a single transport infrastructure programme spanning 20
years.
Common criteria would be adopted when deciding which means of transport to
invest in. Most important of these would be improving mobility, reducing
environmental damage and relieving congestion.
For car users, proposals in the motorists' charter include:
A central record of the make and model of vehicles involved in accidents, so
figures can be used to rank the safety of different cars.
Insurance companies should be required to notify all accident claims to the
Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre. Prospective purchasers of second-hand
cars would then be able to check a vehicle's history for a small fee.
Vehicle mileages should also be notified to the DVLC when they are MoT
tested. It should be illegal to use a hand-held mobile telephone while
driving. Tax incentives on company cars would probably be phased out. Labour
argues this would lower the price of new cars to private buyers by
eliminating big fleet purchases.

FT  03 MAR 92 / World Trade News: US steel companies seek talks with Bush on
voluntary curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
US steel companies are positioning themselves for the March 31 expiration of
the US 'voluntary' steel restraints (VRAs) if the date passes without a
multilateral agreement to lower trade barriers and limit government
intervention in the steel sector.
Speciality steel producers last week announced their support for a
three-year extension of the VRAs and threatened to file anti-dumping and
countervailing duty cases if their protection expires without a multilateral
agreement.
The producers, along with the United Steel Workers of America union,
requested an early meeting with President Bush. With speciality steel
concentrated in a few key electoral states, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana,
election-year politics could bring the president to their point of view, if
a Multilateral Steel Accord (MSA) fails.
In a letter to the president, they said they represent the industry's
high-value and high-technology segment which must be not be lost. 'Our
products have unique characteristics, which makes them critical to the
economic and industrial well-being of the US. There are few sectors in the
industrial economy that could function without specialty steels.'
The American Iron and Steel Institute, whose members produce three-fourths
of the US's raw steel, have reaffirmed their support of a 'strong'
multilateral accord. The institute said the threat of subsidised and dumped
imported steel would be 'very real' without an agreement by March 31.
The trade restraints, begun in 1984, cover both speciality products such as
stainless steel, and carbon steel products, which make up most of the
market. Mr Bush extended them in 1989 for two and a half years but refused
further extensions.
He said he would negotiate an MSA to replace the VRAs. The talks, organised
through Gatt with more than 25 nations, resume on March 16.
Progress is being blocked by a disagreement over US dumping laws, Mr Gary
Horlick, a lawyer for the American Institute for International Steel, said.
'The major block to the negotiation is that the US wants everyone to lower
their tariffs while it maintains tilted anti-dumping laws,' he added.
The speciality steel producers have a different explanation for the
deadlock. The MSA negotiations, they say, 'have been characterised primarily
by the efforts of other producing nations to exempt themselves from the
reach of US trade laws and broaden the scope of permissible subsidy
programmes.'
A working paper for an MSA, presented last week in a negotiating session in
Washington with Japan, Canada and the EC, prohibits use of steel subsidies,
except for a worker adjustment programme, structural adjustment schemes in
the case of permanent plant closing, and environmental programmes and
research. Subsidies spent for development are still in dispute.

'cartel'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Fair Trade Commission (FTC) yesterday said it was investigating the
country's leading ink makers for allegedly forming a cartel to fix prices
after the Gulf war led to higher costs for raw materials, Robert Thomson
reports from Tokyo.
The commission said investigators had raided some 40 offices of about 10
companies, including Toyo Ink Manufacturing and Dainippon Ink &amp; Chemicals,
following allegations that representatives of the companies met in late 1990
to organise price increases. The FTC is expected to order the makers to
disband the alleged cartel, though Dainippon Ink said the company had not
yet received any such order.
News of the investigation came as FTC officials told the Japanese parliament
the government should support the commission's recommendations to increase
fines for price or production cartels from Y5m (Pounds 22,300) to 'several
hundred million yen'. The FTC has been in dispute with the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party which wants the fines in new anti-monopoly legislation to
be far lower than the FTC proposes.

FT  03 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Commercial jet buyers must turn to markets
 -Boeing forecasts reluctance among Japanese financial institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRLINES will have to turn to international capital markets in the face of a
growing reluctance from Japanese financial institutions to pay for the
Dollars 857bn worth of new aircraft they will require over the next 20
years.
This structural change in the financing of commercial aircraft is
highlighted in Boeing's annual review of the world aircraft market to be
published today.
More innovative financing will be required to fund airline jet requirements
especially since Boeing expects to see the contribution of Japanese banks,
trading companies and equity investors in aircraft leases drop from between
55-65 per cent of total commercial aircraft financing in recent years to
barely 8-12 per cent over the next few years.
The willingness of Japanese institutions to invest in aircraft has been
badly damaged by the fall in Japanese share and property values.
Boeing, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial airliners, remains
confident of the longer-term outlook for the industry with a recovery in
world air travel requiring airlines to take delivery of 11,678 new aircraft
worth Dollars 857bn between now and 2010.
But financing the future aircraft requirements of airlines has become a
severe problem for the aviation industry. Boeing says the industry is beset
with three kinds of financial difficulties - 'monumental' losses or
bankruptcy; the declining value of used aircraft; and a general credit
crunch.
The Seattle, Washington manufacturer expects the international capital
market, whose aircraft financing contribution was 'insignificant' in recent
years, to play an increasingly important role in aircraft financing
accounting for between 25-35 per cent of total funding requirements.
Another new source of financing to replace Japanese sources is expected to
come from equity issues. These have also been 'insignificant' but are now
likely to account for 8-12 per cent of total commercial jet financing
requirements, according to Boeing.
US banks will probably drop out entirely from this market, while European
banks are expected to expand their share from 10-20 per cent to 15-25 per
cent. Manufacturers are also expected to become more important financing
sources with their share of the market increasing from 4-6 per cent to 5-9
per cent.
Boeing expects financing conditions to improve with the recovery of airline
profits. Its latest market outlook forecasts world airline revenues growing
in 2000. In a more private market-orientated industry, airline profitability
is expected to recover with 4-6 per cent operating profit margins. A return
to a 5 per cent operating profit margin for the industry in 1995 would be
the equivalent of total profits of Dollars 15bn.
Although Boeing continues to be optimistic about the industry's long-term
prospects, the shorter-term outlook for aircraft manufacturers remains
bleak. Manufacturers, including Boeing, are scaling back production as
airlines defer or, in some cases, cancel orders.
New jet airliner orders fell to Dollars 32bn last year from Dollars 71bn in
1990 and a record Dollars 90bn in 1989. Boeing's share last year was Dollars
20bn, 63 per cent of all orders. The industry in general does not see any
improvement in new order activity this year, with some analysts expecting no
real recovery before 1994 or even 1995.
However, the total industry backlog of orders at the end of last year
remains solid at Dollars 191bn and 3,158 aircraft. Boeing's backlog totalled
Dollars 105bn and 1,665 airliners.
After world air travel declined last year for the first time in the history
of the jet aircraft, Boeing expects it to grow by an average of 5.5 per cent
a year between now and 2000 and then slow to about 5 per cent a year for the
next 10 years.
Aircraft deliveries are expected to average 655 a year between now and 2000
and then 580 a year for the following 10 years. In dollar terms, deliveries
will average about Dollars 45bn a year over the next 19 years compared with
an average of Dollars 18bn a year during the past 21 years.
The Boeing outlook forecasts that of the 11,678 new jetliners worth Dollars
857bn that manufacturers are expected to deliver over the next 19 years, 27
per cent will replace old airliners and 73 per cent will be for airline
growth.

FT  03 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Stop dragging feet on world trade talks,
Germany tells EC
</HEADLINE>

   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY told its EC partners yesterday to stop dragging their feet over
long-delayed world trade talks, Reuter reports from Brussels.
'Any further delay in the negotiations at this stage ..could increase the
acute danger of failure,' Mr Jorgen Molleman, trade minister, told a meeting
of farm and trade ministers. The ministers met for an informal lunch at
which France made it plain it would seek a tough stance against making
concessions in Gatt talks, already more than a year over schedule.
Mr Molleman said he believed the US was ready to talk, though it could still
show more flexibility, and that the EC should do likewise without more ado.
Success at Gatt is seen as one of the few available ways of stimulating the
world economy out of its current stagnation.
Mr Ray MacSharry, European farm commissioner, said before the meeting that
the Commission was pressing on with work on starting points for a possible
accord, summarising the current situation concerning levies on individual
commodities.
Technically, the EC has missed a March 1 deadline for sending these
schedules to Geneva. Diplomats said France was arguing that even giving Gatt
such historical data as a basis for an accord was tantamount to agreeing to
the entire draft agreement of Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general.
Mr Molleman said his call for progress in the talks had been endorsed by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. It was Germany's clearest expression so far of a
pro-Gatt stance, distancing itself from French caution.
France, the EC's biggest farm producer in absolute terms, was on the
offensive yesterday, because the EC has been asked to give Gatt a catalogue
of starting points for trimming tariffs if an accord is reached.
France argues that even doing this is tantamount to accepting a compromise
plan from Mr Dunkel which the Commission has said is unacceptable as it
stands. After the farm and trade ministers' joint session, agriculture
ministers were to gather alone for a formal meeting to pursue work on reform
of the Common Agricultural Policy. Portugal, which holds the rotating
presidency of the EC, will be presenting a new working paper.
'The presidency is presenting a compromise with some elements we would like,
and some we don't, but the basic thrust is the same,' Mr MacSharry said. His
plan is based on a big price cut for cereals, which would be fully
compensated providing participants sign up for a scheme to take land out of
production with limited compensation.
He was quoted as saying later that his bottom line was a combination of
production controls, prices cuts and adequate compensation. He was prepared
to be flexible about how it was all done. Officials say farm ministers will
work through Tuesday and possibly Wednesday on reforms.
Whatever the outcome of the joint farm-trade meeting, farm ministers then
have to resume their own negotiations on an overhaul of the EC's Common
Agricultural Policy. They look set for some headway this time, diplomats
said.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Aids co-discoverer under investigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR Robert Gallo, US co-discoverer of the Aids virus, faces new
investigations for alleged patent fraud and perjury on top of a long-running
inquiry into alleged scientific misconduct at his laboratory in the National
Institutes of Health (NIH).
The latest federal investigations are expected to focus on patent documents
and sworn statements which Dr Gallo made in connection with a 1987 agreement
between the US and France.
That agreement was supposed to settle the vexed issue of who discovered the
virus (now known as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV). Dr Gallo and
Professor Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris would share
scientific credit for the discovery, and royalties from HIV tests would be
divided equally between the two countries.
However, it has emerged since then that the virus originally isolated in Dr
Gallo's laboratory in 1983/84 was derived from a sample sent by Prof
Montagnier in France.
Although Dr Gallo's cell culture may been contaminated accidentally by the
French virus, his critics allege that his sworn statements deliberately
concealed the similarity between his virus and Prof Montagnier's.
Dr Gallo has always insisted that his discovery owed little to the French
work. He now maintains that he believed in 1983/84 that the two viruses were
quite different.
The initiative to pursue the allegations of patent fraud and perjury comes
mainly from the House of Representatives subcommittee on oversight and
investigations, whose chairman Mr John Dingell is upset that an internal NIH
inquiry has not found Dr Gallo guilty of scientific misconduct.
Mr Dingell has brought the congressional watchdog, the General Accounting
Office, into the inquiry. It is understood that the federal Department of
Health and Human Services, which is responsible for NIH, is also
investigating.
At the same time, the Pasteur Institute is pressing the US to renegotiate
the 50:50 royalty sharing agreement. The French claim that new information
shows Dr Gallo merely 'rediscovered' the original virus sent to him from
Paris.
The royalties at issue amount to about Dollars 5m a year from HIV blood
tests. More important, at least in French eyes, is the honour and glory of
being undisputed discoverer of the Aids virus.
However, with Dr Gallo continuing to deny all significant allegations
against him, no early resolution of the affair is in sight.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE government of Honduras has abandoned talks with the Chicago-based paper
company Stone Container over a controversial forestry project following
protests led by environmentalists.
The company was seeking a 40-year concession to exploit up to 1.6m hectares
of pine forest and tropical woodlands in the undeveloped eastern province of
La Mosquitia for the production of wood pulp for its US factories.
The government's decision to scrap the deal, announced by the state forestry
corporation head, Mr Porfirio Lobo, marks on unusual victory for public
opinion in Honduras. A proposed agreement, signed last September, had been
widely criticised following leaks of its contents. Its cancellation leaves a
question mark over the Honduran government's forest policy.
Opponents also included the National Association of Industrialists and the
Association of Sawmill operators, concerned that the agreement flouted a
1974 law requiring 51 per cent Honduran participation in forest enterprises.
Stone launched a publicity campaign at the end of January, arguing that it
would use environmentally sound labour-intensive logging techniques and
reforest areas which have been destroyed by migrant 'slash and burn'
farmers.
The government attempted to negotiate a supplementary contract to meet
protestors' points. But the administration of President Rafael Callejas,
facing the run-up to the 1993 presidential elections, finally decided to
wash its hands of the affair, declaring that a 90-day deadline had been
reached without agreement on the supplementary contract.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Customs Service yesterday struck a blow at the US-Canada free trade
agreement by formally ruling that the content of Honda Civics shipped from
Canada to the US will be subject to a 2.5 per cent import duty.
About 75,000 Honda Civics are manufactured in Ontario for export to the US
each year. A Customs Service audit found that the cars did not contain the
50 per cent North American content required for duty-free treatment.
The ruling has infuriated Canadian officials, who have been trying to
convince their voters that the loss of thousands of jobs since the start of
the FTA three years ago was due to recession rather than the pact. The
decision could make it harder to convince Canadian voters that the North
American free trade agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico will benefit
their economy.
A ruling by the Commerce Department, expected on Friday, could create
further rancour if the US levies new duties of up to 15 per cent on Canadian
lumber. This could bring counter retaliation from Ottawa and an escalation
in the trade crisis, which also includes disputes over beer and magnesium.
The long-delayed Customs Department audit found that the engine blocks,
produced in Marysville, Ohio, and exported to Canada for re-export to the
US, did not contain sufficient North American content. The US and Canada
have been unable to agree on what constitutes local content.
The manager of the engine plant, Mr Al Kinzer, was quoted as calling the
result of the audit 'baffling'. He said: 'We know these are American
engines. We make them in Ohio from aluminum ingot and molten iron. We do not
understand Customs' rules that do not count basic manufacturing processes
such as the casting and machining we do at our engine plants.'
Mr Scott Whitlock, executive vice-president of Honda of America said the
ruling was a severe setback for US-Canada free trade.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Hopefuls struggle in political mass market: Bush still has
to deal with an aggressive Buchanan in Georgia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRATIC and Republican presidential candidates embarked yesterday on a
last day of whirlwind campaigning before today's round of primary and caucus
voting.
Seven states will cast their votes today in the Democratic nomination race,
and five in the Republican race, promising the first significant indication
of the breadth of support for the rival candidates.
On the Republican side, Mr Patrick Buchanan, the outspoken right-wing
television commentator, renewed his attack on incumbent President George
Bush.
The president sorely needs to beat off Mr Buchanan's challenge by defeating
him roundly in Georgia, but must contend with Mr Buchanan's overt appeal to
white racism in the state.
Among the Democrats, former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts and
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas fought to preserve their lead over their
rivals Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and former
Governor Jerry Brown of California.
Until now, the nomination battle has been fought step by step in four states
that rank among the smallest and most atypical in the US.
Together, Iowa, New Hampshire, Maine and South Dakota account for only 3 per
cent of the delegates to the Democratic party's nominating convention, and
fewer than 4 per cent of the Republican party's delegates.
They also number among the most ethnically homogeneous states in the nation,
with a black population ranking below 1 per cent.
Today's seven state contest, dubbed 'Junior Tuesday,' will decide another 10
per cent of convention delegates, and mark a shift from the retail politics
of New Hampshire to a different kind of political mass marketing.
Most of the attention is focused on Maryland, Georgia and Colorado, which
along with Utah for the Democrats hold primaries, since these secret ballots
provide more of a plebiscite for candidates.
Senator Tsongas and Governor Clinton are battling for the lead among the
Democrats in these states, with the former ahead in Maryland and Colorado
and the latter comfortably in the lead in Georgia.
For the Republicans, the battle has been concentrated in Georgia, since Mr
Buchanan has been unable to get his name on the ballot in many states.
But candidates can also boost their campaigns in states which allot their
delegates in closed party caucus meetings - especially Minnesota, where
Senator Harkin is mounting a strong bid with substantial backing among trade
unionists and party activists who take part in such caucuses.
Another four states vote on Saturday, followed by March 10's Super Tuesday
contest, when eleven states will vote. They include Texas and Florida -
after California and New York the two most populous states in the nation -
and between them account for 20 per cent of the Democrats' convention
delegates and 23 per cent of the Republicans.
By March 17, when primaries Michigan, two heavily populated Midwestern
states, nearly half the delegates to the Democrats' July convention in New
York and to the Republicans' August gathering in Houston will have been
decided.
Some political analysts believe it is possible that no clear Democratic
nominee will have emerged by then. Yet all the Democratic campaigns are
running low on funds and badly need the impetus of a victory today and over
the next two weeks.
Mr Clinton, whose campaign has been the best financed and organised among
the Democrats, is in some ways the best placed to persevere. His bid will,
however, be severely weakened if he cannot demonstrate a capacity to win
heavily in the southern states which dominate the next two weeks' voting and
which are viewed as his home turf.
By winning in either Colorado or Maryland, Mr Tsongas could gain enough
momentum to carry him forward from his New Hampshire victory.
Mr Tsongas has touted his 'electability' as a candidate who can draw
alienated Republican voters. 'There are lots of Republicans out there who
will come to us if we give them a home,' he said in a debate with his rivals
on Sunday.
This tactic may be less productive in Maryland, whose local rules allow only
registered Democratic voters to take part in the Democratic primary.
Mr Clinton renewed his attack on Mr Tsongas's economic policies as 'the
1980s style approach' as he campaigned in Maryland yesterday. He appears to
have gained ground there in the last few days, though Mr Tsongas is still
expected to win the state.
Mr Kerrey could be weakened if he fails to win a single state today, while
Mr Harkin is so short of money that he may not be able to sustain his
campaign, even if he wins delegates in Minnesota.
Mr Brown, after winning less than 10 per cent of the vote in two consecutive
primaries, risks losing the federal funding which matches campaign
contributions unless he can score higher than 20 per cent in a subsequent
primary. Democratic party officials, however, fear that his populist
campaign will be able to survive on a shoestring budget.
On the Republican side, the battle is not so much over this year's
nomination, which President Bush is expected to win overwhelmingly, as over
the party's direction into the 1990s.
Mr Buchanan claims that his performance in New Hampshire, where his losing
score of 37 per cent to Mr Bush's 53 per cent was hailed as a moral victory,
has pushed the president's campaign to the brink of disaster.
'I think one more New Hampshire-type victory down here in Georgia and the
whole thing could collapse like a house of cards. Now, that is not our
expectation, but it is our hope,' he said yesterday.
All the same, Mr Buchanan is reckoned to stand little chance of winning even
a single state against the Republican party establishment. Even
right-wingers critical of some of Mr Bush's policies have rallied round the
president.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Boost for hopes of US recovery

<TEXT>
HOPES of an early US economic recovery were boosted yesterday by an
unexpected surge in the purchasing managers' index - a closely followed
barometer of industrial health.
The index rose 5 percentage points to 52.4 per cent, breaking above the 50
per cent level for the first time since November. Analysts had expected a
reading of about 48 per cent. A level of 50 per cent or higher indicates the
manufacturing economy is expanding.
Last year gains in the purchasing managers' index correctly anticipated a
strengthening of economic activity during the summer.
The rise followed Friday's report that gross domestic product grew at an
annual rate of 0.8 per cent in the final quarter of last year, the third
small quarterly gain.
On Wall Street, the jump in the index was seen as reducing the chance of
another cut in interest rates. Bond prices fell sharply on the announcement,
depressing sentiment in the stockmarket.
Mr Robert Bretz, for the National Association of Purchasing Management, said
the economy had regained most of the momentum lost since last autumn. The
index was below last September's peak of 54.3 per cent but stronger than
early last summer, when the economy began to grow modestly.
Most sub-components of the index showed sharp gains. The production index
rose to 58.6 per cent compared with 50.6 per cent in January. The new orders
index rose to 57.5 per cent compared with 50.3 per cent. The figures are
based on a survey of managers at 300 companies.
Separate figures showed a 1.3 per cent rise in construction spending in
January, the first gain since October. The longer-term trend remained weak,
with spending down 1 per cent on the same period last year.
The Commerce Department said personal income fell 0.1 per cent in January,
after rising sharply in December. In real terms, disposable income fell 0.2
per cent.
Consumption spending was weak, rising 0.1 per cent in real terms in January
after a 0.3 per cent gain the previous month. The weakness reflects a dive
in consumer confidence to its lowest level for 17 years.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Adams pulls out of Senate race
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<TEXT>
SENATOR Brock Adams of Washington has pulled out of his bid for election to
a second Senate term after being accused of sexual harassment of employees
and political associates.
The Democratic senator said that it was 'not worth it to continue this
campaign,' but denied the allegations, which he said had been created 'by
people who hate me.'
The Seattle Times, the principal newspaper in Mr Adams' home state, reported
that eight unidentified women had accused the senator of kissing and
fondling them. One said that he had drugged and then raped her.
Mr Adams, who sat for 12 years in the House of Representatives before
serving as transportation secretary under President Jimmy Carter, was
already considered to have been weakened by a similar sexual harassment
allegation made in 1987 by a former congressional aide.
No charges were ever filed, and the US district attorney found the
allegation 'without merit.' Nevertheless, Mr Adams' position was badly
damaged.
Mr Adams' seat has been regarded as one of the best opportunities for a
Republican challenger to cut the Democrats' 57-43 majority in the Senate,
along with that of Senator Timothy Wirth in Colorado.
However, the Democrats are mounting strong challenges in at least seven
Republican-held states, and now stand a good chance of expanding their
Senate majority.

MONGOLIA'S ruling People's Revolutionary Party ended its 21st congress at
the weekend determined to boost the democratic and economic reforms
wrenching the country from 70 years of communism, Reuter reports from Ulan
Bator.
It adopted a new platform of 'centrism', based on Buddhist avoidance of
extremes, to replace the Marxism-Leninism that Mongolia rejected in 1990.
The communist ruling party won a parliamentary majority in elections in 1990
but has since shared power with a democratic opposition. The country faces
elections in June for a new 76-member single-chamber parliament.
The second largest political party, meanwhile, has decided to leave the
government coalition because of the slow rate of economic reform. Mr Erdenin
Bat-Uul, chairman of the Mongolian Democratic Party, said his party had
decided to mount a formal opposition challenge.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Israel's opposition hopes to gain from Likud feuds
</HEADLINE>

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S opposition Labour party, re-unified under the new leadership of Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, yesterday seized on bitter feuding within the ruling Likud
party of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to fuel its increasingly confident
campaign for the June 23 general election.
A complex internal - but very public - contest for top places in the list of
election candidates has led to a prolonged struggle between senior Likud
leaders that has given party hardliners prominence.
A furious Mr David Levy, the foreign minister who has been the most
enthusiastic advocate of Middle East peace talks in the government, accused
Mr Shamir of assisting in 'a conspiracy' against him in the party elections.
After coming second to Mr Shamir in the election for leader, Mr Levy, the
incumbent deputy, was outflanked in the separately-polled race for the
number two spot when Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, and Mr Ariel
Sharon, the housing minister, combined forces to ensure they both finished
ahead of him.
'The results express a move toward the extreme in Likud positions,' said Mr
Rabin, who is promising to move quickly to an agreement with the
Palestinians on the occupied territories and mend relations with the US if
Labour is elected.
Mr Shimon Peres, who has greatly enhanced Labour's new-found unity by
graceful acceptance of being ousted as party leader by Mr Rabin last month,
said the Likud feuding would benefit Labour.
'The minute they take out the swords and point them at each other, they are
making a mistake and sooner or later the Likud will pay for it,' he said.
Mr Levy's humiliation at the hands of Mr Arens - a close ally of Mr Shamir -
and Mr Sharon enraged his supporters in the Likud who are largely drawn from
the less well-off Sephardic, or Oriental Jewish communities. They have
previously been assiduously cultivated by Likud leaders as a bedrock of the
party's success over the past 15 years.
Recently, however, leading Sephardi Likud members have become increasingly
critical of Mr Shamir's leadership. Some went so far yesterday as to
threaten to switch to Labour. They are especially concerned at the state of
the economy, which Labour argues has been neglected by Mr Shamir in favour
of his commitment to settlement in the occupied territories.

</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC should try to establish with key North African countries the same
free trade and close political dialogue as it is seeking with central
Europe, a senior EC official told the Twelve's foreign ministers yesterday.
Mr Abel Matutes, the commissioner in charge of Mediterranean policy, said
the Maghreb presented the Community with the same explosive potential on its
borders as central Europe, but without the same political direction and
technical skills.
He called for EC free trade with Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, and a
wide-ranging political dialogue which would not dodge the sensitive issue of
human rights in these three Maghreb countries. The initiative, born in part
out of EC problems with Morocco, was partly endorsed by ministers.
But France took the lead in urging caution in moving to free trade, which
could pose competitive problems for southern Europe's farming and textile
sectors.
Nonetheless, Mr Matutes, who will visit Morocco next week, was encouraged to
develop his idea further. The Maghreb's economic and political problems, and
the threat of migration they pose to the EC, have moved steadily up the
Community agenda, since the Commission proposed a new Mediterranean policy
in 1990.
This involves Ecu4.5bn (Pounds 3.19bn) in aid and loans for 1992-96.
However, none of this money has yet been spent, because of Greece's worries
that much of it would go to Turkey. Ministers were yesterday unable to
resolve this snag.

THE Paris Club of official western creditors has agreed to reschedule part
of Jordan's Dollars 7.2bn foreign debt, a minister said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Amman.
The accord reached on Friday provides a 10-year repayment period with ten
years' grace for official debt originally due for repayment between 1991 and
mid-1993, Mr Ziyad Fariz, the planning minister, said.
Jordan would repay government-backed loans over 15 years, including an
eight-year grace period, he added.
Mr Fariz would not provide further details but a Jordanian economist said
Dollars 1.4bn of Amman's Dollars 5bn official debt had been rescheduled.
Financial officials had said a rescheduling would cut interest payments this
year to about Dollars 700m from Dollars 1.3bn.
'What we got means support to the economy and confidence in the ability to
perform well in the coming years,' Mr Fariz said.
Mr Basil Jardaneh, the finance minister, and central bank officials are
expected to return this week after holding rescheduling talks with the
London Club of commercial creditors.
Jordan also said yesterday that the US had agreed to provide Dollars 20m in
soft loans to buy 115,000 tonnes of US wheat.
It said the terms of the loan included seven years' grace followed by a
repayment period of 24 years.

THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) yesterday said
it would contribute funds to Poland's ambitious mass privatisation project.
Mr Jacques Attali, president of the London-based bank, called the
privatisation project 'complex and well conceived', and said funding would
be approved 'as soon as possible'. He declined to disclose specific amounts
or dates.
Under the scheme between 200 and 400 state sector companies will this year
be handed to western-managed investment funds, shares of which will be sold
at a nominal charge to Poles.
According to Mr Guy de Selliers, a deputy head of the EBRD, the bank might
provide finance for the funds, which are expected to be staffed by western
merchant bankers 'at the initial stages when there will be a liquidity
problem'.
Loans would also be made available to the cash-strapped Polish companies
involved in the scheme.
During his visit to Warsaw to open an EBRD office Mr Attali also met Mr Jan
Olszewski, the prime minister.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'WORN OUT' and 'incompetent' are the two terms that spring most readily to
French minds when asked to describe the ruling Socialist Party, according to
an opinion poll published yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
The Sofres poll for the conservative daily Le Figaro also showed 61 per cent
of voters want President Francois Mitterrand to resign after next year's
parliamentary elections rather than serve out his term until 1995.
The poll was the latest bad news for the Socialists who are expected to fare
disastrously in regional elections on March 22. Fifty-three per cent of
those questioned described the party as worn out, while 28 per cent said it
was incompetent. Only seven per cent said it was doing a good job in
government.
The best thing the Socialists could do to win back popularity, the poll
showed, would be to prosecute politicians embroiled in a nagging party
financing scandal.
The second most popular remedy was to cut Mr Mitterrand's term from seven
years to five. The 75-year-old president, in power since 1981, is at an
all-time low in popularity ratings.
Mr Mitterrand has remained aloof from the regional election campaign, and
aides have said he does not see the outcome as a significant judgment on his
or the government's peformance.
But Le Figaro said in an editorial that Mr Mitterrand was being 'crucified
in his armchair' and that it was only a matter of time before radical
political change occurred.
'France has begun a kind of hysterical pregnancy,' the paper's editor Mr
Franz-Olivier Giesbert wrote. 'Nobody knows yet what will pop out at the
end.'

FT  03 MAR 92 / Austria presidential campaign tiptoes past the issue: All
parties agree the race for Waldheim's replacement should be a dignified one
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS no doubt a coincidence that a few cells of heavily-armed neo-Nazis
have been uncovered in Austria in recent weeks just as the long-awaited
campaign to elect someone to replace the embarrassing Mr Kurt Waldheim as
the country's president gets under way.
But it is an ironic reminder - if one were necessary - that the last
presidential campaign in 1986 turned sour after disclosures that Mr Waldheim
had concealed his service in a German Wehrmacht unit that was implicated in
war crimes in Yugoslavia and Greece during the Second World War.
The disclosures made Mr Waldheim a lame duck president from the day he took
office, leaving him largely unable to fulfil the one specific responsibility
given to him under the constitution - to represent his country abroad.
But the always delicate relations between the Social Democratic Party (SPO)
and the Austrian Peoples Party (OVP) that have ruled in a 'grand coalition'
since 1986 meant the OVP-backed Mr Waldheim could no be removed - and he
himself saw no reason to leave. Indeed, it is said in Vienna that the ageing
former United Nations secretary general would have been delighted to stand
for a second term.
However, all agreed that he should not, and that this presidential campaign
should, above all, be a dignified one, aimed at restoring some prestige to
this ceremonial office.
'There will be no mudslinging,' assures a campaign manager for one of the
candidates.
Certainly, none of the candidates looks like a mudslinger. The favourite, Mr
Rudolf Streicher, backed by the SPO, is an amiable tool-maker by trade who
rose to head one of Austria's largest engineering companies,
Steyr-Daimler-Puch, in 1986.
Following the Waldheim election debacle, Mr Franz Vranitzky, the chancellor
and SPO party leader, shuffled his cabinet and brought in Mr Streicher to
restore financial order as minister for the nationalised industries.
The industrialist was then handed the equally prickly transport portfolio
and somehow managed to make friends in Tyrol while negotiating an Alpine
transit treaty with the European Community.
The OVP has put forward Mr Thomas Klestil, a former ambassador to the US
who, as head of the country's diplomatic service, won high praise for
drafting the government's response to the Gulf crisis.
Even the controversial Freedom Party (FPO), led by the right-wing populist
Jorg Haider, has found a candidate who would be widely acceptable in Ms
Heide Schmidt, a widely respected lawyer. And the Green Party has nominated
Mr Robert Yungk, a distinguished pacifist intellectual.
Opinion polls put Mr Streicher well ahead with more than 40 per cent of the
vote, followed by Mr Klestil with about a third. They are thus likely to
make it into the run-off after the first ballot on April 26.
By all accounts, the campaign battle will be subdued, although there is the
danger, according to some observers, that Mr Haider will get impatient with
the realisation that his candidate may not get over 10 per cent of the vote,
and so he will try to arouse passions.
Mr Haider has on a roll doing well in the past few months with his
intoxicating rhetorical cocktail of right-wing ideas and xenophobic
nationalism. The FPO piled up ever bigger scores in three regional elections
last autumn, culminating in Vienna in November where it took 23 per cent of
the vote and displaced the OVP as the runner up.
But this year does not look so bright for Mr Haider. Revelations in a weekly
magazine last month of his attempt to bribe a rival into resigning have
tarnished his image. Apart from the presidential election, the only other
poll will be in the autumn in Lower Austria. There the OVP is still very
much in control, and the FPO cannot hope to sustain the momentum it built up
last autumn.
It would be rash to suggest that the extreme right-wing movement in Austria
has peaked or that Austrian politics will slip back into the cosy compact
among the two main parties and various vested interest groups that has
prevailed for most of the post-war period.
For the moment, the SPO-OVP coalition looks secure, but only because the OVP
has become so demoralised. It has been unable to find a way to reverse a
long slide in its popularity despite three changes of leader in five years.
Last November it slumped into third place in the Vienna city elections.
Part of its problem is that the natty Mr Vranitzky, who heads a calm and
business-like government, has become extremely popular in his own right, and
his SPO would probably improve its standing if the OVP quit the coalition
and provoked an early election. In the past, the OVP might have joined
forces with the FPO but this is no longer a credible option because everyone
knows it could not get along with Mr Haider.
If the OVP's muddle continues, the long-mooted realignment in Austrian
politics could begin to take shape before the next general elections in
1994.
Last month, Mr Martin Zumtobel, a little-known businessman from the far
western province of Vorarlberg, launched the Economic Party, promoting
deregulation and privatisation.
No one in Vienna seems to take Mr Zumtobel, a supermarket chain owner, too
seriously but, as one political observer noted, he could be a stalking horse
for others.
The Austrian Parliament has approved the first amendment to Austria's
anti-Nazi legislation since 1945, reducing the minimum sentence for offences
from five years to one.
It is designed to increase the number of successful prosecutions. Juries
have been reluctant to convict because of the severe penalties. Since 1980,
only 14 people have been convicted of Nazi-related offences.
The amendment has the support of all political parties as well as the
international anti-Nazi organisations.

<TEXT>
AN OPINION poll published in Ireland yesterday shows that 66 per cent of
voters are in favour of altering the country's strict anti-abortion
legislation.
This represents a big shift in public opinion since the right-to-life
amendment to the constitution was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum in
1983 by a nine-to-two margin.
The poll was commissioned by the Irish Times, and carried out by the Market
Research Bureau of Ireland (MRBI) after the recent controversy over a High
Court injunction which prevented a 14 year-old rape victim from travelling
to Britain for an abortion. The injunction was overturned last Wednesday by
the Supreme Court.
The poll shows that only 30 per cent of voters wish to retain the
right-to-life article in the constitution, 48 per cent are in favour of
amending it, and 18 per cent want it removed altogether. Only 4 per cent
were undecided.
It also shows 52 per cent of the population are in favour of a new
referendum on the issue.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, said a referendum was low on his
list of priorities following the Supreme Court ruling. The Supreme Court is
expected to publish the reasons for its ruling this week.
Of particular interest is how the ruling may affect Ireland's ratification
of the Maastricht Treaty. Ireland has negotiated a protocol to the treaty,
which will prevent EC legislation from overruling Ireland's anti-abortion
stance.
Dr Desmond Connell, archbishop of Dublin, equated 'the spread of permissive
legislation on abortion' with the kind of abuses carried out 'under Nazi and
communist rule'.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Shkelzen Maliqui, head of the Social Democratic Party of the Yugoslav
southern province of Kosovo, is unlikely to forget his recent visit to
Tirana, the capital of Albania. While out walking, he was attacked by a gang
of youths, robbed of his personal possessions, stripped of his clothes, and
was forced to wait in a car until someone was kind enough to find him a pair
of trousers.
Mr Maliqui's experiences pale into significance when compared to what is
happening in the smaller towns and villages.
Mr Ilika Spiro, a reporter for Albanian radio, last week described a scene
in the town of Pogradec, a few miles from the border with Macedonia and
Greece, which stepped up its border security at the weekend.
'Thousands of people, mainly between 18 and 25, attacked the warehouses of
the workers' supply enterprises, and the privately owned retail stores ..the
police tried to stop them. Then large crowds of people headed for the
industrial area, broke into the warehouses and food and industrial products
were looted. Two people were crushed to death, others have been injured.'
Other correspondents, some from western countries, have had their cars
stolen, have had to pay protection money to the police, and when possible,
travel throughout the countryside with an armed guard.
These reports are broadcast every day by Albanian radio. They paint a
picture of a country in which daily life has slipped into anarchy, partly as
a result of the political and economic vacuum left by the violent overthrow
of the communist system more than a year ago.
The chronic shortages of almost every food item and medical supplies have
also led to random violence, especially among the youth, whose frustration
grows as they see no possibility of emigrating.
Albanian radio recently reported how schools are no longer safe havens of
education. For example, teachers and students from the north-western city of
Shkoder last week protested against violence and terror in the schools after
a local teacher was stabbed.
The shiploads of food sent in almost daily since September from neighbouring
Italy and from the European Community appear to have had little impact in
stabilising the country, which saw industrial production fall by over 50 per
during the last half of 1991.
Residents from the city of Lushnje, about 45 km south of Tirana, blame old
communist bureaucrats and the hated Sigurimi, or secret police, saying they
are behind the demonstrations and violence in order undermine the opposition
parties in the run-up to parliamentary elections due to be held on March 22.
'Bureaucracy and corrupt officials are to blame for the whole incident,' a
resident from Lushnje told state television. 'The warehouses turned out to
be full with goods which they had not distributed to the people. They
deliberately opened the doors of the warehouses to cover their own tracks
after stealing the goods for themselves,' the local added.

FT  03 MAR 92 / Turkey struggles to make sense of trade with CIS republics:
Some euphoria has evaporated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME of the euphoria with which Turkish business greeted the dissolution of
Soviet Union is evaporating as officials struggle to make sense of the new
trade relations with the emerging republics. For all the talk of new
regional banks, both a Black Sea Bank and a Central Asian Bank have been
mooted, Turkey's Eximbank has currently suspended all guarantees on credits
to the new republics.
Turkey's 20-year gas protocol with the Soviet Union, first agreed in 1984,
must now be renegotiated, though with whom is unclear. Gas proceeds have
underpinned Turkish-Soviet trade which in 1990 was worth Dollars 1.7bn.(
Pounds 970m). But Turkey feels it has a headstart in the former Soviet
republics, especially the Turkish-speaking Central Asian states, as a trade
conduit for western companies, and a political counterweight to Iran. 'To go
with a Turkish company is going to be the only way to do business in these
republics,' one Turkish industrialist said.
Turkey this month initialled a broad agreement with the eight states around
the Black Sea to co-ordinate policy on the environment, infrastructure and
transport. In Tehran last month, Turkey, Iran and Pakistan met to revive the
27-year-old Economic Co-operation Organisation (ECO), welcoming Azerbaijan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan as new members. Turkey is well placed to arrange
offtake deals, using the republics' natural resources as collateral for
trade financing, similar to the Soviet gas pipeline. But the current coal
and oil dispute between Russia and Ukraine underlines the need for agreement
between the republics on distribution of raw materials.
Commodity trading may give Turkey some business; in the longer term, with
the shortage of foreign exchange, Turkish traders will have to look at
barter deals. Interbank, a privately-owned Istanbul bank, has set up a
countertrade operation with Kaukomarkkinat of Finland. Turkish companies
have little countertrade experience and without foreign partners, may be
limited to dealing in commodities they can sell in the domestic Turkish
market.
Turkish groups have made use of western aid credits. Enka, for example, has
built military housing for Soviet troops returning from former East Germany.
A new channel for Turkish groups will be to bid on World Bank and other
multilateral agency projects, using this experience. But the picture remains
unclear as long as western banks are unable to agree settlement on the
Dollars 60bn (Pounds 34.2bn) of outstanding Soviet debt, set as the key
pre-condition for the republics to join the Bank or the IMF.
Clearly, finance will remain the main obstacle, at a time of mounting budget
problems at home. Turkey's proposal for new regional banks is dismissed as
little more than a political gesture to the new republics. 'Setting up a new
bank is not going to work if an appetite for doing business does not exist,'
says a London-based trade finance specialist.
Mr Melih Araz, head of Interbank, says the private sector is unlikely to
want to put in equity. 'The state has to chip in.' One western official
familiar with China in the 1970s, said companies may find a similar trade
environment. Unlike Russia and the Ukraine, the Turkic republics have still
to tackle the issue of price controls, private land ownership or private
enterprise, and have no banking infrastructure.
Western officials are worried the first step taken by the poorer Central
Asian republics may be to raise tariffs to protect themselves. In the short
term, trade with neighbouring Black Sea republics seems likely to slow. Gas
proceeds, 70 per cent of which had to be used to buy Turkish goods under
'best effort' terms, are now in Russian hands.
Armenia may offer best short-term business prospects, attracting funds from
the Armenian diaspora in the US and Europe. Mr Ishak Alaton, head of Alarko
Holdings, was in Ankara this week seeking government approval for a Dollars
20m project to rebuild Trabzon Port, using US Armenian money. The project
would provide a land route to the Black Sea for the central Asian republics.

<TEXT>
RURAL America from Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta to farming
communities on the northern Plains is dotted with pockets of poverty that
rival inner-city ghettos in depth and persistence of deprivation, according
to a study released yesterday, AP reports from Washington.
The Population Reference Bureau said its study disputes the popular notion
that America's underclass is entirely urban.
'The changing role of American workers within a national and international
economy is at the root of many of the problems being experienced by the poor
in cities and rural areas,' the report said.
'Mechanisation, automation, and the exportation of jobs to countries with
cheap labour are eliminating the need for workers with little education.'
According to the study, more than 3m adults aged 19 to 64 were in the
underclass in 1990. Nearly one-quarter of this population - approximately
736,000 adults - lives in rural areas.
The study defines the underclass as adults who have not completed high
school and who receive public assistance. If female, they are never-married
mothers, and if male, long-term unemployed.
The make-up of the rural underclass is different from that of the urban
underclass. The rural underclass is 55 per cent white, compared with 17 per
cent in cities. About one-third of the rural underclass is black, compared
with nearly half of the urban underclass. Overall, blacks make up about 12
per cent of the population.

Japanese vehicle sales, excluding mini vehicles, were estimated at 458,618
in February, down 3.3 per cent from a year earlier, an official for the
Japan Automobile Dealers Association (Jada) said, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
February marked the 10th straight month of year-on-year declines in domestic
vehicle sales. But sales were up 44.8 per cent from 316,775 in January when
they fell 0.9 per cent from a year earlier. Vehicle sales in January are
usually lower than in other months because there are fewer business days.
Sales of imported vehicles in Japan fell 14.6 per cent from a year earlier
to 12,720 units in February.

GERMANY'S Treuhand agency said yesterday it had sold off close to half of
the 11,427 former East German state companies or subsidiaries in what is the
world's biggest privatisation programme, Reuter reports from Berlin.
'We have done just about half of our work,' the Bonn government agency,
overseeing the establishment of a market economy in the east since shortly
before German unification in 1990, said in a statement.
The Treuhand said 5,584 concerns had been privatised as of February 1 and
5,843 remained in its stable. Most of the companies emerged from Communist
rule gravely uncompetitive and have had to shed workers and rely on special
subsidies to survive.
Some 1.15m jobs and almost Dm140bn (Pounds 49bn) in investment have been
secured through privatisation of companies or properties, the Treuhand said.
It did not mention that eastern Germany's unemployment has soared from
almost nil to 17 per cent.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Arens emerges as man most likely to succeed Shamir
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MOSHE Arens, Israeli defence minister, yesterday emerged as the potential
successor to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir for leadership of the ruling
Likud Party, after beating off competition from Housing Minister Ariel
Sharon and Foreign Minister David Levy for the crucial number two spot on
the party list.
Mr Sharon, one of Likud's leading hawks and an outspoken advocate of Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories, emerged number three on the list,
dealing a severe blow to the more moderate Mr Levy, who was pushed down from
number two to number four on the party list.
Supporters of Mr Levy, who has been an force behind Israel's participation
in the Middle East peace talks, accused Mr Arens and Mr Sharon of joining
forces to push the foreign minister down on the Likud roster. The
Moroccan-born Mr Levy has a strong following among the working-class and
poor Sephardi voters, who have traditionally given Likud its edge in polls.
Should Likud emerge victorious in the upcoming June national elections, Mr
Sharon is likely to receive a key ministerial post as a result of his strong
showing yesterday.
The US-born Mr Arens, considered to be closely allied with the prime
minister, represents the mainstream camp of Likud. He had previously served
as foreign minister in the national unity government several years ago.
Among the other Likud members to emerge high up on the party's list were Mr
Binyamin Begin, son of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and Mr Binyamin
Netanyahu, a deputy minister in the prime minister's office.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Guinness trial juror defends role of juries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporter
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADER of the jury in the second Guinness trial, which collapsed
recently, has rebutted widespread claims that the trial was too complicated
for juries to understand.
Mrs Edna Wijeratna, in an unusual public statement on the growing debate
over the handling of complicated City trials, blames the length of the trial
on the decision by Mr Roger Seelig, one of the defendants, to conduct his
own case.
She also reports that members of the jury wondered whether 'the
consideration extended to Mr Seelig would have been forthcoming for a
defendant in humbler circumstances'.
The government is considering urgent reforms to English fraud law following
the conclusion of a number of big City trials, including the Blue Arrow
case, which cost an estimated Pounds 35m, the second Guiness trial and
Barlow Clowes.
Mrs Wijeratna's views are set out in a letter to the Financial Times.
In it she asserts the jury had no undue difficulty in understanding the
details of the case, contrary to the view of many legal experts.
'Members of the legal profession have a way of writing about juries as if it
were universally recognised that they are composed of people vastly inferior
in understanding to their august selves.
'This seems to bear no relation to reality, at least as far as Guinness II
is concerned.'
Mrs Wijeratna says it is unusual for a jury member to comment publicly about
a case. But she was aware that people were arguing that it would be better
to take fraud trials out of criminal law altogether.
She writes: 'Surely the legal profession will have failed society if a thief
ceases to be considered a thief, or a cheat a cheat, provided he operates
with sufficient sophistication.' Mrs Wijeratna says the jury's main
frustration was not with the complexity of the 4 1/2 -month trial, but with
the slow rate of progress caused by the decision of one of the defendants,
Mr Seelig, to conduct his own defence.
The judge ended the trial on February 11 after psychiatrists reported that
Mr Seelig was suffering from severe mental, physical and emotional strain.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Monday Interview: Striving to reach Sanctuary - Jack Straw,
the Labour party's education spokesman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Were Mr Jack Straw to take a month off to write his autobiography, it might
appear under the title: Shadow Boxing: from president of the National Union
of Students to chief opposition spokesman on education and science.
Not an obvious best-seller, but it graphically highlights the personal
stakes involved in the coming election. Mr Straw, 45, an MP for 13 years and
in politics all his adult life save for a brief spell at the bar, has yet to
sit on the government benches, let alone hold office. He is not alone. Most
of the shadow cabinet have never exercised power, and Mr Straw, Mr Blair and
Mr Gould - not to mention Mr Kinnock  - have little stomach for another five
years slogging away in opposition.
The son of a Nonconformist conscientious objector, Mr Straw is still
remembered by some as a student union firebrand.
The acid tongue has not deserted him. Even colleagues were taken aback at
his television denunciation of Mrs Margaret Thatcher as 'evil' on the eve of
her resignation. Recent accusations that Kenneth Clarke, the education
secretary, was telling 'lies of Goebbels proportions' about Labour education
plans were par for the course.
Yet for the most part, Mr Straw is a dedicated student of Moderation and
Respectability. He talks of 'the break-up of the traditional categories
(among Labour MPs), reflected by the collapse of the Campaign Group', the
fact that 'the Tribune Group is now the establishment of the party', and
places himself in the party's 'solid centre'. Social solidity has come too.
With his wife Alice - a senior civil servant - and family, he decamps as
often as possible to a cottage in Minster Lovell, on the edge of
Oxfordshire's Cotswolds, and is a stalwart of the parish church. The motto
of his old school, Brentwood, says it all: 'Virtue, Learning and Manners'.
The Church Times was relieved to hear recently that church schools, at
least, are safe in Labour's post-election hands. 'They help to provide the
moral and ethical framework without which education is sterile,' Mr Straw
told it.
But much more than religious education will stay in place if Mr Straw takes
charge of Sanctuary Buildings, the education department's palatial new
offices in Great Smith Street. Of the 25,000 state schools in England and
Wales, only the 15 city technology colleges, 138 grant-maintained schools
and 159 grammar schools need fear for their futures. The national
curriculum, pupil testing, league tables, teachers' pay review body and
local management of schools are all here to stay. Polytechnics will not be
returned to local government, and they will still be able to call themselves
universities. As for private schools, their 30,000 state-funded assisted
places will go, but otherwise they will be left in peace - with even their
charitable status intact, provided they show 'community involvement'.
Mr Straw eschews dogma, dubbing his attitude to teaching methods 'fairly
catholic'. 'I am fairly and squarely with the teaching method that works,'
he says. 'Part of the Tories' problem is they think all the time about what
happened in their own prep schools.' He insists that 'you won't get
improvement if you simply treat teachers as technicians. We need to turn
teaching into an accountable profession'. Accountable to whom? 'To parents,
to the governing body, to the public.'
As for his determination to ban all forms of selection in the state sector,
he says: 'The comprehensive ideal is that you should comprehensively cater
for children of every ability range.' And that means 'ensuring that state
schools do cater comprehensively for very bright children'. So not only will
fast-streaming and master classes be encouraged, but part of the money saved
from assisted places will go on 'centres for gifted children'.
Setting and meeting national standards is Mr Straw's continual refrain:
'Ministers should be setting the standard and making sure it is achieved.'
An Educational Standards Commission, to run a national inspectorate and set
national targets, is a central plank of his programme. He contrasts it with
Mr Clarke's bill - assailed from all sides - to allow schools to pick and
pay their own private inspectors.
How will Labour tackle Britain's poor staying-on rates among 16-year olds?
'We are going to set national targets, and translate these targets locally
and for each school and college within the locality. Through these
imperatives of targets and funding you change the culture.'
It all sounds rather centralist. Local councils, he says, are important 'for
planning the system locally and managing it in a hands-off way'. But he
wants 'a single standard of inspection for all local authorities', and a
single national service to embrace all inspectors.
A new 'Advanced Certificate in Education and Training' (ACET) also features
prominently in Labour's manifesto. Its aim is to span the divide between
post-16 academic and vocational studies, by offering modular courses on both
sides. 'The hard part is to allow students to mix and match,' says Mr Straw,
but he insists 'there will still be a recognisable five-subject A-level
within it (the ACET)'. The current plan is to modularise A-levels by year,
while moving to a broader five-subject curriculum on the lines of the
Higginson report. So three A-levels will become 10 modules, each of them
requiring a written exam.
But Mr Straw is not concerned only with exams. 'The academic/vocational
divide is perpetuated right through government at the moment,' he says, and
he wants a single curriculum council to span the chasm between the education
and employment departments. The current state of vocational qualifications -
'the obsession with competences'  - concerns him. 'You are ending up with
people who are too narrowly trained,' he says. He wants vocational
qualifications broadened and given more rigour.
How much will Labour spend on improving school standards? Mr Straw is coy.
Apart from shifting money from the city technology college programme to
nursery schools, the only immediate spending commitments are to put an end
to primary classes of more than 40 and to abolish outside toilets - neither
of them widespread. Beyond that, all spending is 'as resources allow, in the
famous phrase'.
It is the same for higher education. Loans are to go, and the student grant
made up to its 1990 level in real terms. 'But there is not any way out of
the parental contribution towards student maintenance', and though he
recognises that much of the higher education infrastructure - particularly
the polytechnics - is dilapidated, improvements will only come - as
resources allow.
However, Mr Straw is happy with the emerging three-tier structure of
teaching, research and mixed universities, and will not change it. 'I was
against the rigid classification of institutions,' he says, but 'the
inevitable consequence' of ending the division between polytechnics and
universities will be 'much greater differentiation in higher education', and
the massive projected increase in student numbers is 'bound to come' largely
in the non-research universities.
Mr Straw bridles at any idea that Labour is simply endorsing government
policies. But he is not slow to daub the Tories with Labour policies that
may prove unpopular. In a policy statement announcing Labour's plans to
abolish the remaining grammar schools last week, he was at pains to point
out not merely that the Tories themselves had closed 106 grammar schools
since 1979 'without a peep from John Major or Kenneth Clarke', but that Mrs
Thatcher had shut 363 in her three years as Ted Heath's education secretary
in the early 1970s - while Shirley Williams, her Labour successor, had
managed to disband a paltry 205 in a similar period.
It is the same with the independent schools. Mr Straw believes his policies
will raise standards in the state sector so high that only 'snobs and
eccentrics' will thereafter want to go private. Yet he often cites the views
of the Headmasters' Conference and the Girls' School Association in support
of Labour's policies on curriculum reform.
If the election comes up trumps, how long does Mr Straw see himself in
Education? 'Quite a long time. I feel reasonably well trained for it, and I
would like to be around to take the consequences of what I do.' Now that
would be a significant change from the current regime.

AMERICAN Express and Banamex, Mexico's largest bank, have formed a joint
venture, known as Banamsa, to provide financial services to the fast-growing
Mexican market, writes Damian Fraser.
The new company will start by offering in Mexico an American Express gold
card, co-branded with the Banamex name. Mr Roberto Hernandez, the president
of Banamex, hoped 500,000 customers would subscribe to the card within three
years. Banamex will market the new card in its 725 branches.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Battered by storms but heading for port: The chief executive
of Royal Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBODY thought we'd have the guts to do it,' said Mr Richard Gamble, the
chief executive of Royal Insurance, whose decision last week to omit the
company's final dividend surprised the City and precipitated something of a
run on the company's already battered shares.
Mr Gamble - who took over the hot seat late last year  - believed he had no
option and said the decision enjoyed the unanimous support of Royal's board.
Royal's pre-tax losses of Pounds 373m were substantially worse than many
analysts had expected and very nearly double the Pounds 187m loss reported
in 1990.
That result was the first time the company had ever been in the red in its
147-year history.
In the last two years the company's balance sheet has been wrecked by a
succession of catastrophic losses.
It paid out Pounds 100m to meet the cost of storm losses in January 1990,
and a further Pounds 126m to meet claims from subsidence damage to houses.
Last year it was hit even harder by insurance claims from building societies
and banks who have lost millions of pounds on sales of properties
repossessed after their owners had defaulted on mortgages.
Royal is a market leader in this class of insurance - known as domestic
mortgage indemnity - and underwrites one in every five contracts. It has
paid out Pounds 66m in claims and made provisions of more than Pounds 200m
for future claims which it expects to emerge after properties repossessed
but not yet sold are disposed of.
The group's solvency margin - the gauge used by insurers which compares net
assets as a percentage of annual premium income - fell to 29 per cent at the
year end, a level nearly twice as high as the legal minimum but much too low
for comfort.
Subsequently the sale last month of Royal's Dutch subsidiary to a newly
formed European joint venture - which Royal jointly owns along with
Germany's AMB and Italy's Fondiaria - has pushed up the margin to 34 per
cent.
Even so a dividend payout - even maintained at last year's level  - would
have cost more than Pounds 90m, including the cost of advanced corporation
tax.
After Royal reported disastrous half-year results last August, many analysts
had been expecting a cut but few had advised their clients that the dividend
might be passed altogether.
The result was a rush of selling on Thursday, led by the managers of income
funds. This wiped nearly 20 per cent off the company's market value.
At the end of the week Royal's share price stood at 183p, compared with a
1991 high of more than 400p and a high in 1990 of nearly 600p.
Capitalisation has sunk to less than Pounds 900m and the Royal could drop
out of the FT-SE 100, a huge blow to morale for a company which for much of
this century has regarded itself as the most eminent UK insurer.
Mr Gamble and his senior colleagues were shaken by the fall and are bitterly
critical of what they allege to be shortsightedness by the market.
'What shocked me was the freefall,' said Mr Gamble, who believes that the
market has not fully appreciated the extent of change introduced to the
Royal since he assumed effective control early last year.
A former deputy finance director of British Airways, he has waged war on the
lax underwriting and financial controls that he believes to be at the root
of the company's present demise.
A succession of senior managers have been replaced, frequently by executives
from outside the insurance industry.
Costs have been cut - last year 1,500 people left Royal's worldwide
operations, nearly one third of them in the UK.
Under Mr Gamble's direction, Royal is less concerned about its share of the
market than it was in the early 1980s, when the company grew rapidly in the
UK and North America.
'I was horrified when I came into this business and found it so driven by
market share,' he says.
Strategic thinking at the Royal, like the insurance industry in general, is
too dominated by industry concepts like expense ratios (which measure
expenses as a percentage of premiums) which give little guide to the
underlying profitability of business being written, adds Mr Gamble.
Companies can reduce their expenses ratio simply by underwriting large
quantities of business which may ultimately generate losses.
'We've got to look at real money', he says.
The new profit-centred approach draws a great deal from the experience of
Royal's Canadian operation, led in the 1980s by Mr Roy Elms.
He transformed a loss-making business by insisting that his underwriters
become more selective about risks and backed away from potential problem
areas.
Royal no longer boasts that it is Canada's biggest insurance company but
last year the company increased its profits.
Mr Gamble regards Royal Canada as a 'template' for the global operation and
has appointed Mr Elms to a new position of group underwriting director.
Royal claims some progress has been made already.
Last year it reduced the number of policies it writes by around 10 per cent.
In some loss-making areas like motor business the reduction was even
sharper.
Royal reduced the number of motor fleet insurance policies it sold by 30 per
cent, and insures 17 per cent fewer private motorists than it did 13 months
ago.
The problem, though, is that any improvements have been masked by the
company's mortgage indemnity results. Mr Gamble accuses the market of
'myopia', but analysts are still worried.
The market is concerned by the scale and uncertainty of the mortgage
indemnity claims.
Royal latest estimate is that total losses on mortgage indemnity for last
year, 1992 and 1993 could amount to Pounds 450m.
This compares with an estimate of Pounds 400m just three months ago.
'It just seems to get worse,' said one analyst, pointing out that Royal
reacted to the problem later than some of its competitors.
'Under the circumstances Mr Gamble is a doing a pretty good job. But he is
in the sort of circumstances that you wouldn't want to be in in the first
place.'

FT  02 MAR 92 / Saudi king to set up consultative council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KING FAHD, Saudi Arabia's ruler, yesterday announced the formation of a
60-member consultative council and a new 'basic law' in the first moves
towards broader political participation in the kingdom for 50 years.
The king made the announcement, which has been expected for some months, in
a television broadcast during which he said that 'momentous events in the
recent past . . . have made it necessary to develop the country's
administrative structure'.
Members of the consultative council, or Majlis a Shura, will be named by the
king within six months. The body will be able to question the government,
which will still be firmly in the hands of the ruling al Saud family, and
refer to the king any government actions which it fails to approve.
King Fahd will remain prime minister and commander-in-chief of the armed
forces and will retain the power to choose and dismiss ministers and council
members.
But creation of the new body will open Saudi Arabia's closed and
family-oriented political structure to more open debate.
Hitherto, political participation in the kingdom has been possible only by
recourse to individual petition of members of the ruling family. Moreover,
the new rules will extend to the sons and grandsons of the late King
Abdul-Aziz, the present king's father, a role in determining the succession,
thus establishing, in effect, an electoral college of 500 princes.
The new law is to be based on Islamic Sharia law, which has provided the
kingdom's effective constitution.
However, the law will also contain fresh rules to protect personal freedoms
and safeguard Saudis against arbitrary search and arrest. The latter,
unprecedented reforms, are seen as a means of controlling the activity of
Islamic fundamentalists. Organised groups of fundamentalists, known as
mutawah, have been seeking to impose their own strict interpretation of
Islam through street patrols.
But King Fahd stressed that the political reforms were based on a 'study . .
. and consideration of the kingdom's distinctive Islamic position and its
traditions.' The king has been promising a consultative council since his
accession over a decade ago. In 1980, he set up a special committee to draw
up a system of rule based on Islamic principles.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Life after debt in Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a tendency in Europe to assume that the Latin American debt crisis,
like the poor, is one of those things that will always be with us. Not so,
as those familiar with the remoter reaches of the Financial Times have known
for quite a while.
The wags who asked whether there was life after debt for this benighted area
now have their answers. Private capital is flooding back with a vengeance.
According to a recent report from Salomon Brothers, Latin America attracted
more than Dollars 40bn (Pounds 23bn) of private capital last year, of which
Dollars 15.7bn was in the form of borrowing, Dollars 14bn in direct foreign
investment and privatisation inflows, and a further Dollars 6.4bn in
portfolio investment. That compares with Dollars 13.4bn in 1990.
Here, then, is the world's liveliest new junk bond market. And the striking
thing about the pattern of investment is that it stretches beyond Mexico
into countries that are still notching up interest arrears, such as Brazil
and Argentina.
Even flight capital, that unseemly blight on the regional economy, is
beginning to do an about-turn. The Mexican government estimates that nearly
Dollars 5.5bn of flight capital was repatriated to the country last year.
The growing confidence of international investors can be seen in the way
private sector companies are regaining access to the markets on the basis of
their own balance sheets and cash flow. Also in the stretching out of
maturities in the Eurobond market, where Mexico's national development bank
has even raised 10-year money.
Meanwhile, Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citicorp, which heads the
bank advisory committees to Brazil and Argentina, sees an end to past
problems. He expressed optimism last week that these two countries would
secure outline agreements with their bank lenders by June. In other words,
the Latin American debt crisis could be as good as dead by the 10th
anniversary of Mexico's default in August. Hallelujah.
One of the more perverse features of the world economy in the 1980s was the
way in which the widespread abolition of exchange controls did so little to
encourage an efficient allocation of global resources. Instead of capital
flowing from the developed to the developing world in pursuit of higher
marginal returns, it went into the United States to finance twin deficits,
empty office blocks and better election prospects for George Bush.
Today, the world's biggest creditor country, Japan, would be unlikely to
launch a new dollar support operation to help secure a second Bush victory
even if the government of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa wished to do so. This reflects
the impact of successive scandals, of which the latest, involving Sagawa
Kyubin, promises a vintage crop of nasty revelations.
The credibility of the politicians is at rock bottom and the government's
ability to influence the Bank of Japan and its hardline boss, Mr Yasushi
Mieno, has been undermined.
The extent to which the subtle understandings that used to permeate Japanese
public life have broken down was highlighted last week when the elder
statesman of the ruling Liberal Democratic party called for lower interest
rates to revive the sagging economy. His plea met with a dismissive rebuff
from an impressively deadpan Mr Mieno.
There are powerful forces at work, then, to ensure a better pattern of
capital flows in the 1990s - not the least of them being the transformation
that is going on in the Latin American economies themselves. Even the
dimmest bond salesman could wrap his mind around the story: 400 million
people in a continent with a GNP equivalent to, say, two-thirds of that of
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, which has a vibrant private
sector and where liberalisation is being embraced with enthusiasm.
The impassioned intellectuals who discussed dependencia are out;
intellectuals who have watched the Asian dragon economies make themselves as
dependent as possible on foreign multinationals are in. Three decades after
the dragons dumped their import substitution programmes in favour of
export-led growth, Latin America has got the message. The regional economy
is already looking up. All countries bar Brazil saw solid growth last year.
An eight-year declining trend in per-capita GDP has, according to Salomon
Brothers, been reversed. The icing on the cake, as far as foreign investors
are concerned, is the imminence of the North American Free Trade Agreement:
liberalisation from the Yukon to Yucatan. And there is now talk of the need
for free trade from Alaska to the Antarctic as a defensive response to the
threat of a more protectionist world in which the US and Europe are at
loggerheads on trade.
But are Latin American financial instruments likely to be mispriced? Over
the past year, Brazil's public sector institutions have borrowed in the
Eurobond market at up to 6 percentage points over US government bonds of
equivalent maturity. International investors have been rushing into
short-term money market instruments in domestic currencies at yields
equivalent to up to 20 per cent.
Those figures clearly make some allowance for the risk of compensatory
devaluations that invariably accompany trade liberalisation and for the risk
of default. But whether it is enough is a moot point. David Hale, chief
economist of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services, sees a parallel with
the US junk bond market in the 1980s. He fears that an otherwise healthy
development from the point of view of global resource allocation may
over-shoot and create a new debt crisis in the mid-1990s.
The regulators should thus be on their guard, especially in the US, where
defaults could lead to yet another contingent liability on public finances.
Latin America has, after all, a track record with foreign adventurers. Its
gold played havoc with the Spanish money supply after the Conquistadores
went to work. Its bonds have been the subject of countless defaults both in
the 19th century and in the 1930s, when US commercial banks' efforts to
securitise their bad loans left a formidable mark on the regulatory system.
Latin America seems to have been put there to mask the aspirations of the
greedy. Amazing how the appeal of this elusive Eldorado always reasserts
itself.

FT  02 MAR 92 / India opens up economy with radical budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S industry and financial markets yesterday welcomed a budget which
makes clear that the country remains on track to implement the most radical
changes in economic policy since it became independent in 1949.
The budget marks the first substantial reduction in India's foreign exchange
controls, a milestone in opening-up the country's protected economy.
As part of an effort to deter gold smuggling, the government also intends to
legalise the import of gold - allowing returning Indians or expatriate
Indians to bring as passengers up to 5kg each.
The Bombay stock market climbed 173 points on Saturday after the budget to
pass the 3,000 mark in late trading. That represents a 60 per cent rise
since the beginning of the year.
Mr Tarun Das, director of the Confederation of Engineering Industries, said:
'The budget is giving us confidence. I see no minus points.'
However, the political opposition attacked the budget for doing little for
the bulk of India's 850m people and for bowing to international financial
institutions which have been demanding a reduction in the country's budget
deficit.
India concluded a letter of intent with the International Monetary Fund last
year, agreeing to a gradual but radical overhaul of the state-dominated
economy in return for substantial credits. India's foreign debt stands at
about Dollars 70bn (Pounds 39.8bn).
Mr L K Advani, who as head of the Hindu BJP party is leader of the
opposition, said the measures lacked any worthwhile strategy to combat
inflation. Among the changes announced by Dr Manmohan Singh, finance
minister, were:
The partial convertibility of the rupee.
Permission for foreign pension funds to make direct portfolio investments in
India.
The abolition of controls on Indian companies raising equity funds in the
domestic market.
A rationalisation of the income tax structure to provide three basic rates
of payment - 20, 30 and 40 per cent.
Holders of foreign exchange will be allowed to change 60 per cent of their
foreign currency at a market rate. The remaining 40 per cent must be changed
at the official rate. The move will mean about a 9 per cent depreciation of
the rupee against the dollar. The foreign exchange market in India will
remain closed today
Dr Singh told parliament that the budget deficit had been reduced from 8.4
per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1990-91 to 6.5 per cent in the
current financial year and would fall to 5 per cent in 1992-93.
He said the cut in the budget deficit was the most important factor in
curbing inflation, which remains at 12 per cent - or higher than Dr Singh
had projected when he presented his first budget in July.
The budget foresees the fiscal deficit for 1992-93 falling by 10 per cent to
Rs338.9bn. Total expenditure would rise by only 5 per cent (or substantially
below the inflation rate) to Rs1,190 bn. A large chunk of the increase in
expenditure is accounted for by a 17 per cent rise in interest payments on
government debt.
Among long-term changes announced was a reduction in customs duties as part
of a lowering of India's large protective barriers. Dr Singh said that
tariff duties - reduced from a peak of 150 per cent to 110 per cent - would
be brought down over three to four years to levels comparable with those in
other industrialising developing countries.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Sharp rise in theft insurance payouts: Insurers association
says recession may be causing a rise in fraudulent claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEFT INSURANCE payments rose by more than 60 per cent for domestic
properties and 20 per cent for commercial premises to a total of more than
Pounds 800m last year, according to figures to be released by the
Association of British Insurers next week.
The ABI, which represents most UK insurers, will also announce that fire
damage payouts last year rose to Pounds 1.02bn, half of which is thought to
be due to arson. About Pounds 100m of this, it believes, resulted from
policy holders setting fire to their own property to claim insurance money.
Other heavy lossmaking categories include theft of and from cars, where
claims rose by 50 per cent, and mortgage indemnity policies which compensate
lenders for losses when their properties are repossessed.
The figures for 1991, described by the ABI as a 'diabolical year' for its
members, highlight the background of recession and rising crime against
which Royal Insurance and Commercial Union last week announced heavy UK
underwriting and pre-tax losses.
Results from other insurers in coming weeks are expected to be similarly
poor; General Accident, which reports tomorrow, says 1991 was 'pretty
horrendous' for UK insurers.
Insurers have also noted the public is following the US by becoming more
compensation-minded: 'if it moves, sue it' summarises one insurer. People
driven by recession into frugality are also making claims when previously
they did not bother, and insurers are facing heavy payouts to redundant
workers with unemployment protection policies.
Faced with increases in legitimate claims, insurers are taking a tougher
line on fraud, says the ABI. While last year's fire claim total is just 1
per cent up on 1990 - a decrease after inflation  - the ABI believes
fraudulent arson may be rising as businesses continue to struggle.
Forensic scientists acting for insurers now sometimes arrive at fires before
the flames are doused. The increase in arson has also bred forensic
accountants who check the finances of fire-stricken companies. Insurers, who
suspect many more cases of fraudulent arson than they can prove, record
details of large fires against a checklist, says Mr Nigel Lister, General
Accident's UK assistant general manager.
Tell-tale signs include: a switched-off fire alarm system, lack of evidence
of a break-in, fires which start in several places and at night in an empty
building, non-payment of bills by the company and prior removal of stock.
Soft-heartedness is a giveaway; a guard dog's unaccustomed absence is
significant.
In one recent case a London corner-shop owner, desperate about competition
from a new superstore, lit rubbish behind the counter, locked up and went
home.
The shop was destroyed and its owner jailed for 18 months. Some attempts are
amateurish; an East Anglian furniture importer burnt down his warehouse
before discovering his insurance was not paid up. 'It becomes more difficult
when they bring in the professional gangs which are undoubtedly operating
around the country,' says Mr Lister.
In the past insurers were reluctant to delay payouts: 'claims settlements
are our shop window,' says one. Mr Lister says that, where companies now
withhold payment because fraudulent arson is strongly suspected, claimants
nervous of court hearings often suggest much-reduced settlements.
Other arsonists are vandals, thieves, dishonest staff destroying evidence of
crime and disgruntled employees.

FT  02 MAR 92 / When bureaucrats are brought to book: The implications of a
legal challenge to European Commission rulings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a headline, 'Brussels Slammed For Lack Of Bureaucracy' is from the same
school as 'Man Bites Dog' - unexpected, unbelievable and eminently
newsworthy.
That was certainly the impact of last Thursday's unprecedented court
decision condemning the European Commission for failing to apply all the red
tape required by its own internal administrative rules.
The EC's lower judicial body, the Court of First Instance (CFI), quashed the
Ecu23.5m (Pounds 16.66m) fine levied on 14 of Europe's largest chemical
companies in 1988 for operating a cartel in the manufacture of polyvinyl
chloride (PVC).
As Brussels' work-hungry lawyers have been quick to realise, that could be
only the beginning. Some believe that competition decisions going back years
 -in particular, fines imposed on cartels and on companies which abused
their dominant position - could be overturned on the same grounds.
At the same time, the court judgment, the latest in a series of rulings
criticising procedural faults, calls into question the way the increasingly
powerful Brussels bureaucracy works.
As one competition official put it following Thursday's ruling: 'No act of
the Commission in the past 25 years has followed the procedure that the
Court of First Instance would like us to follow.'
Appeals based on Thursday's ruling would not be trivial. As the confidence
of the Commission's competition directorate has grown under successive
commissioners, Mr Peter Sutherland and Sir Leon Brittan, so have its
punishments. They range from last week's Ecu750,000 fine on Aer Lingus, for
a restrictive ticketing operation, to last July's record Ecu75m fine imposed
on Tetra Pak, the Swiss-Swedish packaging group, for abusing its dominant
position in the EC market.
Since the 1960s, the Commission - now working at a rate of 8,000 decisions a
year - has been taking short-cuts past its own strict internal rules. Those
rules require official decisions, sometimes in all nine Community languages,
to be signed by Mr Jacques Delors, the president, and Mr David Williamson,
the Commission's secretary general.
But to speed the process, Mr Delors and Mr Williamson routinely sign only
the minutes of the meetings where such decisions are taken. Legally,
according to the CFI, such decisions do not exist. The Commission, not
surprisingly, is to challenge the CFI ruling in the European Court of
Justice, the EC's highest judicial body.
Whether every company ever fined by the Commission has a case is debatable.
In theory, appeals against Commission decisions have to be lodged with the
CFI within two months. But some lawyers argue that, if the original decision
was 'non-existent', the deadline itself is meaningless.
Some appeals are already under way. The two largest fines ever imposed by
the Commission - the one on Tetra Pak, and the Ecu47m fine levied on Solvay
of Belgium and ICI of Britain in 1990, for operating a cartel in the
soda-ash market - are being challenged.
Whether the latest CFI ruling becomes a factor in these cases will hinge on
how far they have got. It will also depend on the extent to which the
companies' lawyers are already using procedural arguments against the
Commission.
Individual circumstances will play an important part. In the case of the PVC
cartel, the wider implications of the companies' successful appeal have been
clouded by certain specific criticisms of the procedure relating to this
decision.
In an attempt to head off further appeals, the Commission is likely to seek
a European Court ruling which supports its internal procedure even if it
upholds criticisms specific to the PVC decision. There is no doubt, however,
that for Sir Leon and the Commission's competition directorate - often
attacked for their own legal nit-picking  - this is an embarrassment.
In a speech last September on competition policy and procedures, Sir Leon,
himself a lawyer, criticised companies for bringing complaints to the court
which 'usually turn out on analysis to be no more than a procedural
quibble', and urged them to concentrate on 'the substance of administrative
justice'.
But in the last month, the competition directorate has found itself at the
wrong end of a string of judgments overturning Commission decisions on
procedural technicalities. Most notably, the Commission's attempt to force
British Aerospace to repay 'sweeteners' it received from the government as
part of the purchase of Rover, the UK car company, was overturned.
Such judgments have hinged more on the court's interpretation of the EC
treaty's requirements. However, lawyers involved in the PVC case suggested
last week that the CFI was equally fed up with Brussels bureaucrats flouting
their own rules, even for good reasons such as efficiency and
confidentiality.
As the CFI itself said in its ruling: 'All those formal requirements
governing the drawing up, adoption and authentication of measures are
necessary in order to guarantee the stability of the legal order and legal
certainty for those subject to measures adopted by Community institutions.'
Competition officials in Brussels are exasperated by what they see as the
court's pernickety attitude. 'We are talking about how many angels can dance
on the head of a pin here,' said one. But as most EC lawyers are quick to
point out, if the Commission cannot abide by legal technicalities, why
should the companies which submit to its decisions?

FT  02 MAR 92 / Life, the universe and everything: The Earth Summit is
preparing a mighty agenda, but some critics doubt it will address the right
questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Earth Summit - the ultimate in global get-togethers  - is still more
than three months away. But the next few weeks should determine whether this
grandly named event lives up to its billing of saving the planet for future
generations.
Dozens of delegations from all round the world are in New York for a final,
gruelling five-week preparatory meeting. The intention is that they should
draw up an agenda for the summit and agree to spend hundreds of billions of
dollars on a massive environmental rescue plan. Their achievements will be
put before the Earth Summit itself in Rio de Janeiro in June - an occasion
to which the heads of state or government of 166 countries have been
invited.
Will they succeed?
The Earth Summit is not a clear winner. Its aims are worthy, not to say
timely, and clearly reflect mounting global unease about the environment -
possibly the first issue ever to unite most of the planet's inhabitants.
(Some 3,000 environmental lobby groups will be attending Rio too.) But the
enormous scale of its ambitions has already provoked the sceptics to wonder
whether it will turn out to be more than a giant jamboree. There is also
doubt about some of the more alarming-sounding ecological premises on which
it is built, and some observers wonder whether it is even addressing the
right issues.
One way to get a sense of the Earth Summit is by visiting a grand but rather
faded mansion on the leafy outskirts of Geneva where a group of United
Nations officials has been labouring on the preparations for the last two
years. Here, in an annexe, stands a pile of reports four feet high,
containing 15,000 pages of submissions from 105 countries. This is the raw
material for the summit, listing all these countries' green worries, and
what want done about them.
According to Mr Lars Hyttinen, a Finn who has had the unenviable job of
ploughing his way through the reports, they contain the clear message: 'The
world is on the wrong track.' Wherever you look, people are worried about
the land, the air, the water. They want urgent action to safeguard natural
resources and deal with the environmental damage caused by poverty as much
as by industrialisation.
But while the message may be clear, the evolution of the Earth Summit idea
has been far from straightforward. What began as a plan to convene a
historic gathering to clean up the world has evolved into an enormous and
highly complex exercise in global economics. Political squabbling has also
taken its toll: an important initiative to save the rain forests has fallen
by the wayside because nobody can agree on who is really to blame for their
destruction (all documents now refer only to 'forests'). And while officials
in Geneva have costed their plan at a staggering Dollars 125bn a year for
the foreseeable future, no one has yet promised to foot more than a small
fraction of this bill.
The centrepiece of the summit will be an 'Earth Charter' which will commit
signatories to restore and protect the world's ecology. This will be backed
by detailed plans for action. The main one will be Agenda 21, an 800-page
list of tasks extending into the 21st century. There will also be
conventions to prevent climate change, and to protect the diversity of the
world's living things.
Mr Maurice Strong, the Canadian organiser of the summit, has been touring
the world trying to drum up support, and urge political leaders to attend.
'For years we have been trying to get the attention of the world leaders,'
he says. 'Now we have got them, we mustn't miss the opportunity. If Rio were
to break down, picking up the threads would be very time-consuming.' But
even now, Mr Strong's guest list has some conspicuous gaps in it. While
government heads in many industrialised countries like Britain, Germany and
Japan have told him they will come, President Bush has yet to say yes.
Without the US, the world's greatest source of greenhouse gases but also of
clean-up money, the event could well be a flop.
One reason why the Earth Summit has assumed such enormous proportions is
that Mr Strong and his colleagues believe that it must tackle not just the
symptoms of environmental damage, but the causes. It is not merely a matter
of cleaning the world up, they argue, but also of ensuring that the summit
agrees on a pattern of economic growth that will avoid causing fresh damage
in the future.
This has widened the Rio agenda to include a whole set of measures to
encourage what has come to be known as 'sustainable growth'. These are aimed
principally at the industrialised countries whose wasteful use of resources
is blamed not just for damaging the environment, but also for denuding Third
World countries of their natural riches.
However, the whole thrust of the debate has moved well beyond the role
played by advanced countries and into the realm of north-south relations.
Virtually all the documents that have been prepared for the New York meeting
stress the need for huge transfers of funds and technology from the richer
to the poorer countries to enable them to deal with their environmental
problems.
This is based partly on the view that the industrial countries are
responsible for much of the damage that has been done to the Third World and
should therefore pay for it. But in economic terms, UN officials argue that
many of the world's gravest environmental problems result from poverty. Poor
countries, living from hand to mouth, have to chop down trees and hack away
the land simply to survive. They cannot afford to invest in new,
environmentally friendly technology. Worst of all, the heavy burden of debt,
and the protectionist barriers erected by the industrialised world prevent
them from breaking out of their predicament.
Even though the industrialised countries actually produce most of the
pollution, Mr Strong maintains that investment in environmental controls in
the Third World is potentially far more productive. He points to the example
of China which wants to double its gross national product over the next 12
years, yet it has 750,000 old industrial boilers which belch smoke into the
sky. Unless such problems are dealt with soon, 'by the next century the
developing countries will be contributing more greenhouse gases than we
are,' he warns.
However, the emergence of Third World issues at the top of the Rio agenda
has led to suggestions that the summit will merely dress up the old
arguments for more aid in newly fashionable green-tinged garments. The
numbers certainly reinforce this impression. The annual figure of Dollars
125bn produced by the Rio secretariat represents not the global clean-up
bill, merely the amount of money needed by the Third World in the form of
aid, debt forgiveness or technology transfers to achieve its green goals. At
the moment, actual aid that falls into these categories amounts to Dollars
55bn, implying a need for some Dollars 70bn a year in new money.
By any measure, the numbers look extravagant, and could jeopardise Rio
simply through their size. They include, for example, Dollars 150m-Dollars
200m a year merely to operate an information exchange to channel details of
green technology to the Third World - something that probably be done for a
fraction of the cost.
Mr Strong admits that the sums are large, and that he is asking for the
money at a bad time from the recession-hit donors' point of view. But he
says 'no one fainted or exploded' when he presented them to aid ministers.
He has a lower set of figures for actual negotiating purposes, but he
declines to discuss them.
The actual amounts of money needed to make Rio a success are less important,
he believes, than creating the necessary impact on world opinion, and
bringing the issues alive. In particular, he says the industrial world must
learn 'to make space' for the Third world. 'The absorptive capacity of the
eco-system is being pre-empted by the north,' he warns.
Donor countries will also have to be convinced that the ecological premises
are as threatening as Mr Strong's team maintain that they are. For example,
scientists have recently scaled back some of their more alarming forecasts
about global warming. This has weakened the European Community's case for a
carbon tax; it now seems unlikely that this will feature as strongly on the
Rio agenda as was once thought, though Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC
Environment Commissioner, is determined that the EC should be prepared to
adopt measures that will set the right example.
There is also a question whether the summit is even addressing the right
questions. If Third World development has been identified as the most
pressing problem, the Rio participants might do better to confront more
relevant issues, such as the trade barriers and agricultural subsidies by
which rich countries keep out exports from the Third World. If, on the other
hand, global warming is the most urgent question, perhaps Rio should aim for
a few specific measures to curb emissions, rather than go for the grand but
possibly unachievable solutions.
With such a mighty agenda before them, few of the participants are willing
to speculate about the outcome at this stage. The European Community, one of
the few to have come out with a position paper in advance of the New York
meeting, accepts that developed countries have 'a special responsibility' to
encourage sustainable growth. It also agrees that more money should be given
to the Third World, though it opposes the creation of any new agencies to
disburse it.
Japan is also making supportive noises, and will be chairing an informal
meeting of eminent international persons in Tokyo next month to discuss ways
of raising new money. But Japan is believed to have asked that marine
mammals are not included in the summit because of its controversial whaling
activities.
The biggest uncertainty remains the US position. In the coming weeks,
President Bush will come under intense pressure from the environment lobby
to declare support for the summit. But politically, that could ensnare him
into commitments to introduce severe emission-curbing measures. The US has
already been accused by the Worldwide Fund for Nature and Greenpeace of
dragging its feet in negotiations for the convention on climate change.
What the New York meeting should show are the limits to what is
realistically achievable in Rio. The secretariat has deliberately set a
highly ambitious agenda to drive home the scale of the problem. But it also
risks overwhelming the participants with issues and costs.
The result will almost certainly be consensus on the need for action, though
there will be differences on how much and by whom. The chief issue, as
always, will be money. But the secretariat has made clear that it will be
satisfied with promises rather than signed cheques. Mr Joe Wheeler, the
director in charge of financial matters, says: 'We are looking for less than
pledges of new money, but for more than generalities. What we want is a
credible statement of intentions.'

FT  02 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Buying voters, 'prudently'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN JAPAN, politicians are bought retail; in Britain, voters are bought
wholesale. Polite western circles regard such Japanese practices as, well,
'alien'. But, alien or not, they are a good deal less expensive. The Pounds
4bn in discretionary tax cuts that the British government is rumoured to be
considering for the Budget due on March 10 is Pounds 300 for every likely
Conservative voter. How might a prudent government, especially one dedicated
to balanced budgets, justify borrowing to fund so handsome an electoral
bribe?
Political justifications are not hard to find. What is needed is a tax cut
large enough to entice the electors but not so large that it frightens the
foreign exchange markets. Unfortunately, too much prudence, like its
opposite, might prove imprudent. If the foreign exchange markets were to
decide that the electorate had not been bought, the resultant weakness of
the pound might limit the scope for interest rate reductions.
Nothing in recent experience suggests that the Treasury is likely to get
such a calculation right. But what it would certainly need to do first is
rethink its fiscal policy.
The government's an-nounced policy is to balance the budget over the cycle.
Cycles can be almost as long as pieces of string. Suppose, however, that
this cycle started in 1988, the year of the most recent peak and, not
coincidentally, when the present fiscal doctrine was enunciated.
The forecasts of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, adjusted for
deteriorating economic prospects, suggest that nominal net borrowing between
1988-89 and 1996-97 could easily be over Pounds 80bn. The government might
run offsetting surpluses in the remaining years before the next cyclical
peak, whenever that is. But the moon might also be made of green cheese.
Debt ratio
Discretionary tax cuts would throw the current budgetary rationale into the
dustbin. A good thing, too, many will say. If one wants a rule, a more
sensible one might be to hold the ratio of public sector debt to GDP
constant at the current level of 38 per cent, which would imply a public
sector borrowing requirement averaging about 2 per cent of GDP (Pounds
12bn). Alternatively, the public sector debt ratio could be targetted at 60
per cent, the ratio agreed at Maastricht, which would allow huge amounts of
borrowing.
Some argue that no fiscal rule makes sense, especially with monetary policy
fixed in the ERM vice. Fiscal policy should be far more flexible than
hitherto. The combination of a fixed exchange rate with fiscal fine-tuning
would bring the UK most of the way back to the demand-managing 1960s.
Fiscal boost
In short, should the government wish to abandon its past policy to justify
an expansionary Budget, it can easily find a rationale for doing so so. Nor
would it be possible to condemn the result out of hand. Not only are any
likely discretionary fiscal changes small against those that have already
occurred in recent years, but demand is unquestionably depressed.
Particularly if inflation were going to fall swiftly to the best European
levels, a fiscal boost could be justified.
Nevertheless, this does not look the right route, above all for this
government. The cyclical timing of any demand-oriented fiscal manipulation
would only be as good as the forecasting models. Worse, shorn of credible
medium-term rationales, fiscal policy would dance to the tune of the moment.
Since deficits are far easier to create than surpluses, the probable result
would be inexorable pressure on public spending and a steady increase in the
burden of public debt.
The likely medium-term combination of a tight monetary policy with a
deterioration in the structural fiscal position is frightening. It looks
especially risky for a country with a substantial current account deficit in
the midst of a deep recession, above all if the tax cuts were largely aimed
at boosting consumption.
Even politically it might be better for the government to stick to the
hairshirt it has long made its own. To attempt to buy the election at this
late stage would look like panic. The government can rightly argue that the
recession is the necessary fruit of a disinflationary policy on which both
parties are agreed, but that it alone has been prepared to do what was
needed. This, not abandoning its well-established fiscal position, is now
its only plausible defence.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Indian budget for business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLING BACK decades of central, bureaucratic control in India is a huge
task. The government of prime minister P. V. Narasimha Rao began it last
year, under the stimulus of a balance of payments crisis. With foreign
exchange reserves now restored, this year's budget was to provide the
evidence that the attempt at reform was both serious and for the long term.
A great deal was at stake when Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister,
unveiled the 1992-93 budget on Saturday.
The government's determination to press ahead with reform is impressive. Dr
Singh's budget has moved faster in some areas than might have been expected,
and more slowly in others than might have been hoped. But the overall
direction is clear: Dr Singh has maintained momentum.
The opening of the Indian economy to the world has been accelerated. Tariffs
are now to be cut, modestly at first, but with a commitment to bringing them
down to levels comparable to those of industrialising developing countries.
Dr Singh has taken a big step towards the dismantling of the licence 'raj',
by removing licence requirements from most imports. His move towards rupee
convertibility has also come sooner than expected.
Financial markets
Dr Singh's financial reforms seek to balance the diminishing role of the
state by stimulating the flow of private capital. His measures - including
removal of government control over stock issues, exemption of financial
assets from wealth tax, indexing of capital gains for inflation, and
considering permission of direct portfolio equity investment by foreign
institutions - are good news for India's financial markets. In its
encouragement of private enterprise and competition, this amounts to a
radical budget.
There are areas in which more explicit progress would have been desirable.
Though the reduced role of government is unmistakeable - the reduction of
the budget deficit from 6.5 to 5 per cent of GDP means general cuts in
subsidies - the government has still to tackle the grossly overmanned and
inefficient public sector: both state industries and the bureaucracy.
Policy on closure of chronically 'sick' industries has advanced only a
little, with allocation of capital for a National Renewal Fund. It continues
to proceed cautiously on privatisation, selling only minority stakes and
providing little incentive for improvements to their management and
efficiency. Banking reform, urgently needed to underpin change, has only
been partially addressed.
Job losses
Evidently, the government has not deemed it politically safe to take
measures potentially causing large job losses when the economy is already
suffering from measures taken last year to tighten liquidity and restrict
imports. Economics and politics could yet derail the government.
The biggest economic risk is that inflation will not fall as the government
projects, forcing a renewed tightening of monetary policy. Hitting the
targets for both higher growth and lower inflation would certainly be an
achievement.
Politically, Dr Singh is treading in a minefield, as was shown last week,
when he was attacked for purportedly discussing budget secrets with the
World Bank. The opposition parties, which so far have not had the will to
unseat a government confronting problems that they would otherwise have to
face, have recently been sharpening their teeth. Wholehearted support within
the governing Congress party, which has overseen most of the years of
central control and socialism, cannot be taken for granted.
Yet Mr Rao and Dr Singh are engaged in nothing less than the transformation
of India and the sloughing off of the fears left by colonial domination. A
very long road lies ahead. It is in India's interest that they be allowed to
continue upon it.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Arts: Rattle's Mahler 10 - Royal Festival Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
"Towards the Millennium' has reached second base. The celebration of this
century's music dreamed up by Simon Rattle and the late Michael Vyner as a
joint venture between the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and the
London Sinfonietta is this spring exploring the richest of all its decades,
from 1911-1920.
Rattle and the CBSO opened the London series on Saturday with a concert they
had given in Birmingham two nights earlier: Mahler's Tenth Symphony,
sketched in 1911 and given in Deryck Cooke's performing version, was coupled
with the work that two years later built upon late Mahler in a surreal,
expressionist way, the Three Orchestral Pieces by Alban Berg.
Rattle's steady progress through the Mahler symphonies took in the Tenth at
an early stage; it was the first of the symphonies he recorded (with the
Bournemouth SO), and he has continued steadfastly to promote its virtues.
His account of Cooke's completion is presented without apology, as a natural
and fully achieved part of the canon.
There is no over-emphasis of the work's despair; even in the work's most
anguished moments Rattle sought out beautiful textures and elegant lines, as
if the resignation of the Ninth Symphony had been transmuted into something
more positive and consoling.
So even the famous climax of the opening movement was made more striking for
its unearthly sound quality than its piled-up dissonances, and the repeated
drum strokes of the finale seemed less brutal cut-offs than moments of
articulation, redirecting the argument as it careered towards its last
affirmation. There may be doubts about some aspects of Cooke's version.
(Mine are not concerned with the idiom and continuity of the music but with
its length: had he lived might not Mahler have tightened the finale in
particular?). It was offered here as a rounded and profoundly compassionate
musical journey.
From seats well forward in the Festival Hall, more than close enough to
detect any hint of a loose end or scrambled textures, the Birmingham
performance was a marvel of unity.
The orchestra's lean, refined string tone appears to gain constantly in
expressiveness; the wind playing becomes more and more characterful and
secure: the brass in particular had a field day in the Mahler, with vivid,
penetrating solos (first horn, trumpet and tuba outstanding). A memorable
start, then, to a festival series of immense promise over the next month.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Management: Over the heads of the politicians - Charles
Leadbeater asks business leaders what contingency plans they are making for
a change in government, and meets with a blank response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Britain's political leaders, with their teams of strategists, pollsters
and public relations gurus, feverishly finalise their plans for the election
campaign, the captains of the nation's industry look on with an air of
bemused indifference.
Business has grown used to having the Tories in power. It has been the
beneficiary of more than a decade of reform designed to promote a healthier
commercial climate. Yet companies seem unruffled by the prospect of a change
of government.
Robin Biggam, chairman and chief of BICC, the construction, engineering and
cables group, voices a widely held view: 'Political uncertainty really has
had no direct bearing on the way we are managing the business.'
What explains the equanimity with which managers view the election and how
well grounded is their confidence that political turmoil will not have a big
impact on the way they do their jobs?
Big British companies are less vulnerable to political pressures than they
were a decade ago, because the nature of the pressures has changed and so
have the businesses.
Large companies such as GKN, the engineering group, have reduced their
reliance upon the UK economy and thus their vulnerability to changes in
government policy. As Sir David Lees, GKN's chairman, explains: 'Two thirds
of our business is overseas, a decade ago two thirds was in the UK.'
Moreover, there is greater agreement than before over economic policy.
Sterling's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism has provided
an anchor for other policies, while European economic and monetary union
will also impose constraints on budget deficits. Both parties are at least
rhetorically committed to the market economy, sceptical of incomes policies
and pledged to develop Britain's role within a more integrated EC economy.
It is therefore not surprising that industrialists say the policy debate in
the election campaign has had little direct impact on business. A key
indicator of that can be seen in investment intentions. Companies say they
are not delaying investments to wait until the outcome of the election is
clear.
Sir David at GKN says: 'We are planning investment decisions on a two- to
four-year horizon, so short-term political factors cannot have much of a
bearing upon those decisions. The odd company car purchase might have been
deferred. But big decisions do not depend upon politics.'
The main impact is indirect. Industrialists are increasingly concerned that
uncertainty among consumers is delaying recovery. Many companies believe
strong underlying demand in housing and consumer markets is being held back
because consumers are waiting for the outcome of the election. A further
delay to calling the election or a hung parliament would further prolong the
uncertainty and thus the recession.
John Hudson, the chief executive of Wagon Industrial, the Telford based
engineering group, said: 'Political uncertainty is having a most
debilitating effect upon consumer markets.'
Tom O'Connor, deputy chairman of Elta plastics, agrees: 'Consumer markets
need something to create a degree of confidence. Nothing will do that before
the election and a hung parliament could be very serious because that would
mean another election in 12 months.'
According to Sir David: 'The general unease among consumers, about issues
such as the effects of tax plans, is quite harmful. There is a danger that
if the government waits for confidence to pick up before calling an election
it will just compound the unease and delay the recovery.' So companies'
planners may be ready to adjust their projections of the timing of the
recovery to take account of when the election is called and whether it
delivers a clear verdict.
However, managers at three groups of companies will be thinking about the
election with much greater attention to detail than manufacturing industry
in general.
Life could change dramatically for public corporations which could be
privatised if the Tories win - British Rail and British Coal  - and for
privatised companies that could face a threat of renationalisation if Labour
wins - principally the water companies.
The very existence of BR as a corporate entity depends on whether a
Conservative government returns to carry out its rail privatisation plans.
Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, has sought to protect his managers from the worst
effects of the uncertainty by telling them to get on with their work while a
small policy team at headquarters writes position papers, briefs the board,
and fields requests for information from the Department of Transport.
Defence companies, such as British Aerospace and GEC, stand to lose the most
from changes in government procurement policies. At BAe the appointment of a
new chairman is likely to be delayed until it is clear who will be the
company's political masters. The Saudi Arabian government is thought to be
delaying extending its lucrative arms deal with the company until the
election is decided.
Businesses in Scotland and Wales may have the most to worry about from the
changes which might flow from growing calls for devolution.
Scottish companies are already unsettled. Ron Garrick at Weir group, the
Glasgow-based engineer, said: 'The Scottish scene is very uncertain, the
debate is very confused and shallow. There is strong opinion in favour of
devolution which would come with tax raising powers. That is very concerning
because some people in Scotland would go crazy if they were given the
opportunity to raise funds with other people's money.'
He added: 'That means we are not rushing major investments decisions in
Scotland but we will be going ahead with investments in England. Business
will vote with our feet.'
The political environment for business is in the midst of a significant
change, but the election is only a small part of political shift is from the
values, language and priorities of Thatcherism to those of the post-Thatcher
world whether run by a Tory or Labour government.
The free wheeling, debt funded, entrepreneurial, laisser faire boom of the
1980s is over. In the first half of the 1990s growth will be slower, profits
harder to win and the outlook less stable than in the 1980s.
British managers are coping with after effects of the Thatcher boom,
fighting their way through recession. They are only just beginning to
address how the skills which will be demanded of them in the years to come
will differ from those of the decade just gone.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Share option gains of 90 per cent seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS typically make gains of more than 90 per cent on the value of
their share options, according to a survey by Incomes Data Services, a
research company. The highest gain reported is a Pounds 2m profit made by a
director of Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals group.
The findings are based on a sample of 113 options exercised by directors of
41 companies during the fourth quarter of last year. Share option schemes
give executives the right to buy shares in their company in the future at
the current market price.
The survey finds that directors typically exercise their share options after
four years. Three quarters of the options reported in the survey were
exercised within five years of being granted. A link is seen between the
length of time an option is held and the profits made. The 25
best-performing options were held for an average of 5 1/2 years, while the
25 worst-performing options were held for less than four years.
Some high-performing options, such as a 789 per cent gain on an option
granted by Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste disposal company, resulted in a large
gap between the median profit of 93 per cent and the average percentage
profit of 127 per cent.
The median profit in cash terms reported in the survey is nearly Pounds
62,000. Some 17 of the top 25 options made a profit of more than Pounds
200,000.
A separate survey by Paisner, the law firm, shows that more than 20 per cent
of the companies which joined the stock market last year set up employee
share-ownership plans. That survey suggests that there was an expansion in
the numbers of employee plans and a steep decline in the number of senior
executives with large share profits compared with previous years.
The best endowed plan, at Pounds 5.3m, belonged to JIB Group, the insurance
broker.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Handling of economy 'appalling'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's 'appalling mismanagement' of the UK economy will prolong
the recession throughout this year according to economists at Liverpool
University, Edward Balls writes.
The latest forecast from Liverpool Macroeconomics Research expects output to
fall by 0.4 per cent this year, with only a weak recovery in the final
quarter. Unemployment is projected to reach 2.9m by the end of the year, and
depressed demand for imports is expected to push the current account back
into surplus.
Professor Patrick Minford, director of the group, said the recession was
being prolonged because UK economic policy was 'paralysed by the exchange
rate mechanism'. The ERM was keeping interest rates high, in spite of
falling inflation and low monetary growth. The group expects retail-price
inflation to fall to an annual 2.9 per cent in 1992.
Prof Minford is a member of the group of 'Liverpool Six' monetarist
economists who have repeatedly called on the government to cut interest
rates and leave the ERM.
Mr Bill Martin, chief economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and one of the six,
endorsed the forecast, describing the outlook as 'decidedly bleak'.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Budget 92: In search of clues to the elusive 'feel good'
factor - Business confidence is hard to create and even harder to define.
Unlike inflation and interest rates, the mood of business cannot be
precisely measured
</HEADLINE>

   THE 'feel good' factor
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or lack of it  - can win or lose general elections. With business confidence
falling rapidly, time is running out for the government. Economic indicators
are unlikely to show any great improvement before the election, so the
government is pinning its hopes on fostering an optimistic mood with a
tax-cutting Budget on March 10.
That may not be as easy as it sounds. Confidence is elusive - hard to create
and even harder to define. Unlike inflation and interest rates, the mood of
business and consumers cannot be precisely measured and fed into computer
models. When the economist John Maynard Keynes used the expression 'animal
spirits', he captured the intangible nature of what makes businesspeople
tick.
Put simply, it is to do with expectations. If entrepreneurs expect good
markets they invest and a bandwagon of growth takes off.
The Confederation of British Industry has tracked business confidence since
1958 by asking companies whether they are more or less optimistic about
prospects than they were three months before and by plotting the difference
to give an optimism index.
The index reached its lowest point of - 75 in January 1974, a month after
the announcement of the three-day week. One of its highest points since 1958
was June 1963 (+53), when Harold Wilson began his 'white-heat-of-technology'
general election campaign.
The CBI says the most important determinant of general business optimism
identified in its survey is the level of orders. Interest rates rank second,
with exchange rates and political conditions at home ranked equal third.
But what effect can a hot summer, a big sporting success, Big Bang, or the
end of a war have on that elusive 'feel good' factor?
If you are looking for a consumer-led recovery, events such as a royal birth
or a World Cup win are a good thing, says Professor Nigel Nicholson,
director of the Centre for Organisational Research at the London Business
School.
'But you can only buck the market for so long, and there are always going to
be global economic forces at work at the same time,' he adds.
Professor Douglas Mc-Williams, economic adviser at the CBI, considers
outside factors to be 'surprisingly unimportant' in defining business
confidence against the evidence company managers see with their own eyes. A
company is confident when it is meeting its budget targets and loses
confidence when it falls short, he says. Only in the former instance will a
company be inclined to spend in the short term.
Similarly, Mr Ian Thompson, economic adviser at the Engineering Employers'
Federation, points to activity at a micro-level when he defines business
confidence. 'There could be a pick-up in business confidence when destocking
comes to an end as the end of destocking brings orders for companies back up
again,' he says.
Activity at a micro-level constitutes the more tangible end of what
influences confidence. But what of the other factors beyond company and
factory walls that are said to hold sway over confidence?
One of the problems of conducting a survey of confidence is that respondents
tend to reflect their own hopes in the answers they give to questions about
prospects for turnover.
Mr Kevin Gardiner, an economist at merchant bank SG Warburg, believes
businesses are influenced by national issues such as whether sterling should
be devalued, the level of house repossessions and the general election.
'People who fill in the CBI surveys watch the media as much as anyone else
and are going to be influenced as much as anyone else,' he says.
Mr Clive Thomson, chief executive of Rentokil, the London-based timber
treatment and services business, agrees.
'I think the media influences business confidence a great deal,' he says.
'If you read or see people expressing gloom or despondency it is very
difficult to maintain a positive stance.'
Mr Richard Brown, co-ordinator of a survey of business confidence carried
out by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, believes that when
confidence started to rise in the third quarter of last year there was a
feeling that the respondents were being 'egged on' by comments the
chancellor was making about 'green shoots of recovery'.
His critics would call this 'jawboning' - attempting to create a mood by
talking the economy up or down, an unlikely way of encouraging growth. As Mr
Geoff Unwin, executive chairman of computer consultancy Hoskyns Group, says,
confidence has to be based on a sound belief.
'Unfortunately the government has cried 'Wolf' too often - if someone keeps
saying that the economy is going to get better next month and it never does,
you end up not believing them,' he says.
This year an obvious uncertainty affecting confidence is the general
election.
Mr Paul Droop, an economist at the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, which draws up
forecasts of the economy using the Treasury's computer model, says the
election is bad for optimism. 'If there is a change in government there
could be a change in policy, so no one really knows what to expect.'
But it is the uncertainty rather than the outcome that appears to be
stifling decisions.
Mr Malcolm Blackburn, the managing director of Otter Controls, a thermostat
manufacturer in Buxton, Derbyshire, says his company did just as well under
Mr Harold Wilson as it did under Mrs Margaret Thatcher. He says that big,
one-off events are more likely to influence confidence than changes of
governments.
'We felt optimistic about the Common Market in the 1970s because it meant
the disappearance of export duties - that was an optimistic period. But the
oil price shock worried us because we are a very large user of nylons, which
are oil-based.'
Mr Gardiner at Warburgs points to the absence on the horizon of any such
one-off confidence boosters. He says: 'Looking further into the 1990s, we
are going to see eastern Europe opening up - but that is a long way off at
the moment.'
But if the Budget fails to boost confidence, there could be another saviour
for the Conservative party - and the longer the election is delayed the more
effective it will be. It is the weather.
Mr Unwin is a great believer in the weather. 'People just generally feel
better when the weather is better,' he says. 'I think it was a contributory
factor to Heath losing the election in February 1974 - it was snowing, it
was cold and everybody felt bloody miserable.'

FT  02 MAR 92 / Warning of increase in inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUDGET plans for tax cuts or higher public spending on infrastructure
investment could lead to higher inflation and unemployment unless combined
with a policy of co-ordinated wage restraint, a leading left-of-centre think
tank argues today, Edward Balls writes.
An expansionary Budget is needed to prevent unemployment rising to 3m this
year, according to the Institute of Public Policy Research.
Such a Budget should include a short-term programme of maintenance of
schools, hospitals and council houses, it says.
Central government restrictions on the ability of local authorities to build
new homes should also be lifted.
Yet boosting demand could lead to a renewed bout of wage and price inflation
unless unions and employers agree to limit pay settlements, the report
argues.
The institute says the government should open talks with employers and
unions in order to draw up a pay policy. Any workable strategy would have to
contain an agreement on the desired 'going rate' of pay settlements and the
circumstances under which exceptional increases could be allowed.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Companies express interest in providing BR rail services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MALCOLM RIFKIND, transport secretary, yesterday said that about 12
private companies had expressed interest in providing various rail services
when British Rail's network monopoly is broken, Gary Mead writes.
He said the government 'will end British Rail's monopoly because there are
already about a dozen British companies who want to provide new services,
both freight and passenger'.
Mr Rifkind said that one reason why private investment might be sought was
poor performance by some sections of British Rail.
Among those interested in participating in a future privatised network is Mr
Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin, the entertainment and travel group.
Mr Rifkind said suggestions that his views on British Rail were at odds with
those of Mr Major were 'complete rubbish'. He added: 'John Major and I have
a very close shared view on what we would like to see happen.
'There has been no row in cabinet and it has not been discussed in cabinet.'
Conservative policy on the future of British Rail is now likely to be
detailed in the party's general election manifesto.
It appears that the party has shifted ground, bringing it closer to Labour
policy. Mr Rifkind suggested that both government subsidies and private
investment would run in tandem.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, accused Mr Rifkind of having
'pinched' some of Labour's ideas. 'I do not mind private people coming in,'
he said. 'What I do worry about is safety.'

FT  02 MAR 92 / Rail charter hits funding problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL and the Department of Transport are this week likely to run
into criticisms that the long-delayed Passenger's Charter, due out on
Wednesday, has turned into a damp squib.
Earlier intentions of giving passengers an expanded system of compensation
for late and cancelled trains have foundered because neither BR nor the
government is prepared to fund it. Total compensation for late and cancelled
trains is unlikely to exceed the Pounds 6.5m in cash, travel vouchers and
season-ticket extensions handed out last year.
The main effect of the charter will be that BR's arbitrary and semi-secret
system of compensation will be restructured and publicised so that people
will know whether they are eligible for refunds.
BR has argued that without government funding an enhanced compensation
scheme could be financed only by higher fares or cuts in railway investment.
The Treasury, however, was not prepared to underwrite it.
Instead, a watered-down scheme will come into effect from May. The main
points in the modified scheme are: Compensation arrangements for people
making individual train journeys (as distinct from commuters) will be
virtually unchanged. If a train is cancelled or delayed unreasonably
passengers will not receive compensation automatically, but will be invited
to submit claims if they miss appointments or incur costs.
A self-financing 'insurance' scheme will be introduced, with business
passengers in mind. By paying a reservation fee in advance, travellers will
be entitled to an automatic refund of probably a third of their fare if
their train is cancelled or badly delayed.
Commuters will receive extensions to their season tickets for days on which
there is no effective service because of snow, industrial action or other
factors.
Commuters on poorly performing Network SouthEast routes will face lower
annual fare increases than commuters on recently modernised lines.
Each Network SouthEast route will be given its own target for punctuality
and reliability. If performance falls short of this, commuters with season
tickets will be given a discount on renewal. A similar scheme will apply for
Regional Railways commuters, but the performance target will be set for the
sector as a whole.
The RMT railworkers' union dismissed the charter as 'a political gimmick'.
It said that the solution to poor services was to give BR the financial
resources to improve quality.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Comparison of local taxation plans shows rich areas losing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOTERS IN Bath, where Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, will defend
a slim 1,412 majority at the general election, would be among the biggest
losers under the government's proposed council tax.
According to the most detailed independent survey so far of the three
parties' local-taxation plans - published today  - if the council tax were
introduced this year adults in Bath would pay an extra Pounds 86. That would
be the biggest increase in England.
The study of the council tax, Labour's fair rates and the Liberal Democrats'
local income tax finds that each system results in wide variations in
average local tax bills for each adult at both regional and local-authority
levels.
Under the council tax, to be introduced next year if the Conservatives
retain power, the areas with high property values would tend to lose while
those with low values would gain.
But the size of the swings would not be as great as that under Labour's fair
rates or a local income tax.
By far the biggest losers under the proposals from the opposition parties
would be relatively wealthy areas.
The northern region of England, for example, would be the biggest winner
from Labour's plans, with each adult paying on average Pounds 82 less than
under the poll tax. Adults in Barrow-in-Furness would have to pay Pounds 183
less.
These gains would be made at the expense of Greater London and the
south-east where average bills would rise by Pounds 60 and Pounds 54
respectively. Each adult in south Buckinghamshire, for example, would have
to pay Pounds 178 more.
The local income tax proposed by the Liberal Democrats would produce the
lowest bills of the three options in metropolitan districts and inner London
boroughs, but would add most to bills in the south-east.
The study, produced for the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants,
is the first to estimate local tax levels for each adult in England under
the various options, and it includes the Pounds 140 universal cut in bills
announced in March last year.
It is based on published proposals for local taxation by the three main
parties, this year's grant allocation and government estimates of the
distribution of houses according to eight tax bands.
Mr Peter Smith of the University of York, the author of the report, says
that the contrast between the systems highlights the difficulty of balancing
equity against efficiency in local-government finance.
'There is in principle no reason why the two objectives . . . cannot be
addressed in such a system of local-government finance,' he says. 'However,
none of the systems currently proposed satisfactorily reconciles the
dichotomy.'
The report urges the setting up of a Royal Commission.

TOUGHER security measures are in prospect following the weekend IRA bomb
attacks in London.
British Transport Police are studying the feasibility of video surveillance
of London's main railway stations.
Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, yesterday supported calls for
addresses of general-election candidates not to be published on ballot
papers. He said he had had clear advice that terrorists should be denied
easy access to information of that sort.
The move would mean an emergency bill to alter electoral law.
Labour said it would co-operate if the security forces advised that the
measure was necessary. The Liberal Democrats said voters were entitled to
know where candidates lived and opposed what they said would look like a
'panic response'.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Ulster leaders to decide on talks formula
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland ministers and local political leaders will today try to
decide how formal negotiations on the province can be reopened amid news
that churchmen have sought to curb loyalist paramilitary attacks.
The IRA bomb attacks in London at the weekend soured faint optimism over
Northern Ireland's future created by a surprise agreement late on Friday
between nationalist and unionist leaders to resume 'round-table'
negotiations before the general election.
Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, will hear details of the deal
this morning and is determined to respond positively. But the proximity of
the election means that, at best, only a few formal sessions are likely.
As with past apparent breakthroughs, unforeseen obstacles may still emerge.
There is also a suspicion that an agreement was struck only because local
MPs feared entering an election having failed to reopen talks.
Meanwhile it emerged that representatives of the Presbyterian Church have
met members of the legal Ulster Defence Association (UDA), the largest
loyalist paramilitary group. The delegation included two former moderators,
Dr Jack Weir and Dr Godfrey Brown, and Dundonald minister Dr Roy Magee.
Dr Magee said: 'We asked the UDA leaders how they thought we could get out
of this terrible situation and pointed out the folly of the violence.'
Mr Brooke will meet Irish ministers in Dublin on Friday when a suspension of
further Anglo-Irish conference meetings - a Unionist precondition for talks
 -could be agreed.
'Round-table' talks could start next Monday but would probably be halted if
later that week Mr John Major called an election for April 9.
Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two Unionist leaders, and Mr
John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party,
deliberately kept a low profile over the weekend but it appears that past
disagreements over what would happen if a Labour government was elected
while talks were under way have been quietly dropped.
Further squabbles could erupt over the Irish government's proposals for a
review in 'round-table' talks of the 1920 act which led to partition of
Ireland.
The talks would follow the same formula as the failed negotiations last
summer. They would start with government of the province, then relations
between north and south Ireland, and finally relations between London and
Dublin. The Irish government would be involved only in the last two stages.
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, would be excluded throughout.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Ashdown force advances on main parties' flanks: Lib Dem
hopes of battle honours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democrats are in confident mood. As the war of attrition between
the two main parties has churned the electoral landscape into a muddy
battlefield Mr Paddy Ashdown's third force has begun to advance.
Its gains are so far undramatic but the lesson for its more powerful
Conservative and Labour rivals has been that they cannot afford to ignore
their flanks.
For the first few weeks of the year, opinion-poll support for the Liberal
Democrats seemed stuck at around 15 per cent - enough to ensure the party's
survival at the general election but presaging the loss of perhaps a third
of its 22 seats at Westminster.
Since early February that support has picked up steadily, and in the latest
batch of polls stands at 18 per cent. Awkward publicity about Mr Ashdown's
personal life appears to have helped rather than hindered the party. His
ratings rival those of Mr John Major and remain far ahead of those of Mr
Neil Kinnock.
So the party's claim that its vote on polling day will be more than 20 per
cent no longer looks incredible. On present form it should keep most, if not
all, of its seats.
The early start to election campaigning has provided the Liberal Democrats
with the oxygen of publicity, bringing forward the traditional pre-election
'lift' in third-party support.
The intensely negative strategies of his rivals meanwhile have left Mr
Ashdown the beneficiary of an unusually strong 'plague on both your houses'
factor. Disenchanted with slanging matches, voters have been impressed by
the way the Liberal Democrats' have stood above the fray.
Party strategists argue that an emphasis on policy - in particular on
setting out the case for constitutional reform, on plans for economic
recovery and on the need for higher education spending - has generated a
more positive appeal. The result is what the strategists see as a virtuous
circle.
Liberal Democrats thrive on publicity. Strong opinion poll ratings - and the
guarantee in the campaign proper of near-parity of television coverage -
provide the exposure which again boosts those ratings. But Mr Ashdown cannot
afford to be complacent.
During much of last year the Liberal Democrats prospered at the expense of
Labour as Mr Major's popularity eroded the strong lead which Labour had
built up towards the end of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's leadership. The general
assumption was that the resultant split in the opposition vote would keep Mr
Major in Downing Street.
More recently, however, the Liberal Democrats have taken votes from the
Conservatives as 'soft' supporters of the government have reacted to the
deepening economic gloom.
The risk is that the third-party vote will be hit by the traditional
two-party squeeze. The threat of a Labour victory might encourage a shift
back to the Conservatives. Those determined to remove the government might
judge that a vote for Mr Kinnock is the only option.
Liberal Democrat leaders are aware of the threat. Mr Des Wilson, the party's
campaign director, has drawn up a strategy designed to confront the 'wasted
vote' charge.
The constant refrain will be that in two-thirds of Conservative-held seats,
the Liberal Democrats rather than Labour provide the main challenge. It will
gloss over the fact that most of those constituencies are Tory strongholds
rather than vulnerable marginals.
By setting out clearly the party's conditions in the event of a hung
parliament, Mr Ashdown hopes to avoid the confusion which dogged the
Liberal-SDP Alliance campaign in 1987. He is determined to escape in advance
the blame for a second election.
It will not be easy. For now, Mr Ashdown can content himself with
opinion-poll findings showing that the electorate's disenchantment with the
Conservatives is matched by its mistrust of Labour.
His fear must be that, in the end, the voters might be more horrified still
at the prospect of a hung parliament.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Taxes and prices stay in political spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAXES and prices will again dominate pre-election campaigning this week as
Labour launches a fresh attack on Tory plans for value added tax and the
Tories seek to play up the 'vicious circle' that they say would come from
the interaction of the opposition's economic policies.
The Liberal Democrats will highlight their 'shadow Budget' with a claim that
Labour is being too cautious in its response to the recession.
Today, in the last full week of campaigning before the Budget, Labour will
focus on the prospect of an extension of VAT to house purchases, fares and
funerals. Its attack will include a region-by-region survey of the likely
impact on the cost of new homes.
It says there is pressure from the European Community for moves towards
harmonisation of VAT, but that if a Labour government were involved in the
negotiations it would invoke 'a Maastricht-style opt-out'.
Later in the week Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, will set out the
principles of Labour's Budget proposals. The party will not spell out its
plans in detail until after the Budget itself.
Mr Tony Blair, the shadow employment secretary, said on BBC's On the Record
programme yesterday that Labour would bring in an emergency package that
would take more than 220,000 people off the unemployment register in the
party's first year in power.
The Tories this week will contrast the claimed impact of Labour's plans,
such as the minimum wage and the removal of the ceiling on National
Insurance contributions, with the government's record.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said yesterday that a current lack
of confidence was holding back recovery but this would be removed by the
election - 'providing we win it'.
While Labour is gratified by the impact of its attack on the government over
the irresponsibility of borrowing for tax cuts, Mr Hurd insisted in a TV-am
interview that there was no need for the Tories to be defensive about public
borrowing.
He said that the flexibility to respond as necessary to the recession came
from being prudent in the years when debt could be repaid.
The Liberal Democrats' Budget proposals will be launched on Wednesday by Mr
Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, and Mr Alan Beith, its Treasury spokesman.
The plans include the expansion of the party's recovery programme, which is
now intended to last two years and to create 600,000 jobs. In earlier
estimates it had been expected to last one year and create 400,000 jobs.
Mr Ashdown emphasised yesterday that most of the recent polls had indicated
there would be a hung parliament after the election.
He said on TV-am that in those circumstances he would vote down a minority
government that did not offer proportional representation, even if it
proposed a Scottish parliament.
He added: 'At that stage you would have a government that rejected the
judgment of the ballot box, sought to govern on a minority basis and
therefore had objected to the democratic judgment of the British people.'

FT  02 MAR 92 / Loophole continues to disrupt poll tax cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENS of thousands of court cases for poll tax non-payment are still
disrupted because of the confusion over the use of computer evidence before
magistrates, according to local authorities.
At a seminar last week organised by local authority associations, councils
reported that many cases had been withdrawn or adjourned until later this
month or beyond. This followed the ruling by magistrates in Coventry, upheld
by the High Court, that computer evidence was 'hearsay' and not admissible.
Ministers have emphasised that summonses could be issued for a date after
the legislation which will allow computer evidence is passed. The bill
ensuring this is due to become law in the next week or so.
The councils, however, suggest that in some areas the summonses have been
put off for longer than ministers advised.
Tory-controlled Croydon Borough Council decided not to issue 25,000
summonses, scheduled to be heard about now, after advice from the local
magistrates' clerk. These will not now be issued until next month for
hearing in May. Labour-controlled Birmingham withdrew 10,000 cases last week
and is issuing no more summonses 'until the law is clear'.
The government said last month that it would legislate to put the
admissibility of computer evidence beyond doubt - and decided to do so
through the bill to replace the poll tax with the council tax.
It refused to accept Labour's offer of co-operation on an emergency bill to
clear the Commons in a single day.
The difficulties will be highlighted on Wednesday, when the council tax bill
returns to the Commons and MPs get their first chance to discuss the issue
in detail.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, said: 'The figures
illustrate the devastating impact of the government's delay in closing the
computer-records loophole. Government dithering has brought poll tax debt
enforcement to a virtual standstill in many areas.'
He condemned as 'a travesty of the truth' ministerial attempts to blame
councils for difficulties in collecting the poll tax.

FT  02 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Watchdog criticises mortgage lenders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTGAGE lenders are making the homes repossession crisis worse by insisting
on 'unrealistic' repayment schedules for borrowers in arrears, the National
Consumer Council said yesterday.
Many lenders failed to give borrowers struggling with repayments enough
help, according to the council, a government-funded watchdog. 'All too often
mortgage lenders do not contact customers in arrears until too late and, by
insisting on unrealistic repayment schemes, only make repossessions more
likely,' it said.
Its study follows last month's report from the Council of Mortgage Lenders
showing that more than 500,000 households were behind in mortgage payments.
Lady Wilcox, who chairs the consumer council, said mortgage lenders were 'in
business to help people buy homes, not to take their homes away from them'.
The lenders' council rejected the claim. 'It is not in the lenders'
interests to sit back and do nothing,' it said. 'Lenders are constantly
reviewing their policies.'

FT  02 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): EC works councils find approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT and employee representatives involved in prototype European works
councils are satisfied with their operation, the European Foundation for the
Improvement of Living and Working Conditions said yesterday.
Its report looks at the experience of the dozen European works councils,
most of which have been established by French multinationals. It concludes
that more will spring up voluntarily even if the European Community
directive on making works councils compulsory fails.
The British government is strongly opposed to compulsory works councils, but
the issue could be pressed by the 11 other EC states through the social
policy 'protocol' established at the Maastricht summit.
The authors of the report, Mr Michael Gold of the National Institute of
Economic and Social Research and Mr Mark Hall of the Industrial Relations
Research Unit at Warwick University, say existing councils share many
features. Most meet only once a year to provide group-wide information,
discussion of national issues is not allowed, consultation is unusual and
'negotiation entirely non-existent'.
The authors say managements find them useful to explain company strategy,
especially in relation to restructuring, although some managements fear they
might become a platform for Europe-wide collective bargaining. Employee
representatives find them helpful for information-gathering and establishing
closer links between unions.

FT  02 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Civil servants' pay set to beat
inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PAY BILL for more than 300,000 civil servants whose salaries are linked
to rises in the private sector is set to rise by more than the current rate
of inflation, and possibly well above it following a government-commissioned
survey of private-sector settlements.
Under a formula agreed in the late 1980s, pay settlements for the 300,000
civil servants must fall within the 'interquartile range' - or middle half -
of private-sector deals in the previous year. Most of the civil servants are
in junior or middle grades.
The survey, results of which will be confirmed today, shows that the middle
50 per cent of pay rises in the private sector in the past year were between
4.5 per cent and 8 per cent.
In the year to January, the inflation rate was 4.1 per cent. That may rise
by April, when the pay rise for the civil servants takes effect. But it is
not expected to rise far above 4.5 per cent, the lowest level at which a
deal is possible under the Civil Service 'interquartile' mechanism.
Any settlement above the level of inflation would be likely to draw
criticism from the private sector, which is already concerned about the
effects on government spending of high pay settlements in the public sector.
Earlier this month workers whose pay rises are determined by public-sector
review bodies were awarded increases averaging 6.5 per cent from April.
In the talks for the junior and middle-ranking civil servants there are
pressures for the settlement to be well above the 4.5 per cent minimum. The
survey, carried out by the Office of Manpower Economics, showed that the
median rise for comparable private-sector jobs last year was 6.5 per cent.
The NUCPS and CPSA Civil Service unions, which negotiate for junior and
middle-ranking civil servants, will argue that 6.5 per cent is the minimum
acceptable to their members. They will also seek compensation for big
changes in pay bargaining demanded by the Treasury.
The changes are aimed at extending performance-related pay and increasing
the scope for government departments and agencies to opt out of centralised
pay bargaining. Negotiations about the changes are some way from settlement.
The unions are concerned about introducing performance-related pay to civil
servants who have not reached the top of the pay scales for their jobs.
There is also opposition to proposals which would mean that workers whose
performance is judged unsatisfactory would lose annual increments.
Traditionally, these have been paid each year to all civil servants on top
of a general pay rise.

FT  02 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): BBC to decide in May on options for
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANAGEMENT and governors of the BBC will decide on a range of options
for the future of the corporation in May in preparation for the
re-negotiation of its Royal Charter, which runs out at the end of 1996.
The range of possible options is being collated by a committee headed by Mr
Howell James, director of corporate affairs, and Ms Patricia Hodgson, head
of the corporation's policy unit. They are choosing from a list of options,
some contradictory and none of them costed, drawn up by 15 internal
committees set up last year to examine every aspect of the corporation's
future.
The proposals are believed to include the abolition of Radio 5, the
enhancement of BBC local radio and the recognition that in areas such as
drama and entertainment the BBC should be popular, but should not try to
match everything offered by the competition. Radio 3, it is suggested,
should end drama and concentrate on classical music, including live
performances, together with serious information and arts journalism.
Some of the committees' proposals have already been rejected and others have
received powerful backing in advance of a formal decision.
Sir Michael Checkland, the director-general, has rejected a proposal that
the corporation's orchestras should be privatised. He has argued that such
arts patronage is a central part of the corporation's role as a public
service broadcaster.
The BBC hopes to agree a blueprint for its future by late spring and publish
the document early in the autumn in order to open a public debate. The
debate is likely to be at its peak next year with the legislative process on
the Royal Charter getting under way in 1994.

FT  02 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Pressure rises on training budgets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE training budgets are under increasing pressure because of the
recession, according to a survey published today by the Industrial Society.
Compared with a survey carried out by the society last September, the latest
survey of 486 companies shows that fewer companies expect training budgets
to rise over the next six months. The proportion is 32 per cent compared
with September's 38 per cent.
The society, an independent organisation which aims to foster improved
industrial relations, also notes a rise from 13 per cent to 24 per cent in
companies which expect budgets to decline.
The survey will contribute to the political debate over whether companies
should be forced to spend a fixed percentage of their payroll on training
employees.
The Labour party would introduce measures to ensure that each company sets
aside at least 0.5 per cent of pay. The Conservatives want to encourage
further spending, but would leave employers to decide the amount.
Deep cuts in training budgets in the last recession are widely viewed as one
of the most important contributors towards skill shortages in the late
1980s.
In another survey published today, the Wyatt company of consultants and
actuaries finds that a quarter of employees do not believe training in their
organisations adequate for the job. More than half thought their
organisation was ineffective in developing people.
In spite of the expected squeeze on future budgets, the Industrial Society
survey found that spending so far in the recession has held up well compared
with the economic downturn of the early 1980s.
It found that 40 per cent of companies spent more on training in the final
six months of last year than in the same period of 1990.
In explaining expected cuts in training budgets, 69 per cent cited
competitive pressure on costs, 55 per cent blamed shrinking staff numbers
and 41 per cent cited lower sales.

FT  02 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): IBM deals blow to computer leasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE computer leasing industry is up in arms over a change in policy by
International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer,
which other companies believe threatens their ability to continue providing
customers with secondhand and rebuilt mainframe computers.
IBM has already taken legal action in the US against Comdisco, the largest
leasing company, claiming it has been 'counterfeiting' components in
computers sold to customers as IBM machines. It has now written to
customers, brokers and leasing companies in Europe warning them that
critical components in rebuilt IBM machines may also have been passed off as
being manufactured by IBM.
Such components could be more likely to fail than its own parts, IBM warns.
They would also not qualify under the company's maintenance agreement.
Customers, brokers and their bankers fear that the new policy could
adversely affect the price of used IBM equipment.
An immediate effect has been a doubling of the price of genuine IBM memory
cards - printed circuit boards bearing an array of semiconductor chips. The
cards, which store 128m bits of information, have risen in price from Pounds
100,000 to Pounds 200,000 in the past few months.
The row, although apparently esoteric, is critically important because of
the size and significance of the broking and leasing business. In Europe
alone it generates revenues of Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) a year and is a
principal mechanism through which medium-sized and large businesses acquire
IBM mainframes. Refurbishing and refitting old machines to suit customers'
requirements is basic to the economics of the leasing business. Until now
IBM has approved this procedure and validated rebuilt machines.
Mr Geoffrey Sewell, director-general of the Birmingham-based European
Computer Leasing and Trading Association, said it was the most important
issue the leasing industry has faced since IBM user equipment was first
traded in the early 1970s. 'If IBM has its way, the net result will be that
within three years there will be no other source of new and secondhand
machines than IBM itself,' he said.
He added that IBM was right to be concerned that the integrity of its
products was not compromised, but that the rules should not be changed
retrospectively.
He wanted an amnesty on all equipment currently installed and running well,
while discussion continued between the association and IBM on a policy for
the future.
IBM's case against Comdisco in the US will be heard on April 15.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Capital gains and the UK's balance of payments constraint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'GLOOM as trade deficit doubles'. Last Friday's Daily Mail headline,
following a provisionally estimated current account deficit of pounds 794m
in January, carried many echoes of the past. 1991's estimated current
account deficit was 1 per cent of gross domestic product, down from 4 per
cent in 1989 and 2.8 per cent in 1990. But if January's level were to
continue, the deficit would be over 1 1/2   per cent of GDP this year,
recession notwithstanding.
Is the balance of payments about to disturb the sleep of British
policy-makers once more? Not necessarily, suggests a monograph by Cliff
Pratten of the Department of Applied Economics, Cambridge University, who
concludes that over the course of the 1980s the UK enjoyed real capital
gains of pounds 50.4bn (at end-1989 prices) on its net holdings of foreign
assets.*
What might Mr Pratten's numbers have to do with the balance of payments
constraint? 'The implication of the current balance-of-payment deficit,'
writes Mr Pratten, 'is that Britain's net overseas assets are falling; but
this is not necessarily the case, because of changes in the value of
Britain's assets and liabilities - that is capital gains (or losses).' Net
gains in the real value of assets can allow the residents of a country to
spend more than their conventionally measured income, without getting any
poorer.
Most of Mr Pratten's monograph is devoted to showing why official estimates
of the UK's net international wealth (and changes in it) have been too low,
the main reason being the valuation of direct investments at book value. His
conclusion, shown in the table, is that between 1979 and 1989, UK residents
became very much richer in their net holdings of international assets, even
though the officially reported current account deficit was pounds17.2bn.
Mr Pratten's work suggests that over a run of years the inflation-adjusted
current account deficit would have to exceed around pounds 5bn in 1989
prices before the net international wealth of UK residents would
deter-iorate; and it would also take a long time for UK residents to become
net external debtors.
So far, so comforting. But the analysis does take one only so far. Caveats
include:
Asset price instability. Official estimates show a decline of pounds 57.3bn
in the gross value of UK resident's foreign assets in 1990 alone. Any
home-owner who planned to finance consumption by borrowing against the
increase in the value of his house knows too well what that means.
Asset illiquidity. Many assets are illiquid, either because they are
physical assets or because of how they are held. Pension funds, for example,
cannot be liquidated to finance current consumption.
False aggregation. Assets enjoyed by some UK residents are not at the
disposal of others, be they private individuals, companies or the
government. The country could suffer from a shortage of creditworthy
borrowers, while still a net creditor.
Governmental irresponsibility. Behaviour of the government may so frighten
both domestic and foreign investors that capital flows out, regardless of
the external asset position.
Adverse payments trends. The growth in net borrowing over time may undermine
people's willingness to lend to UK residents.
The last problem is suggested by the chart (whose semi-logarithmic scale
means that changes in slopes show changes in trends). The UK current account
deficit has declined sharply since its peak in 1989. But this is largely
because the volume of imports has fallen. Export performance has
deteriorated, despite the recession.
It is not difficult to envisage an explosion in the current account deficit
when demand growth resumes. If so, this would provide a stern test for the
now conventional view that the balance of payments need have no bearing on
prospects for domestic growth.

All trade figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series and
the German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting the
visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are calculated on
the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and Italian imports which
use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance and freight charges).
German data up to and including June 1990, shown in italics, refer to the
former West Germany. The nominal effective exchange rates are period
averages of Bank of England trade-weighted indices. Data supplied by
Datastream and WEFA from national government and central bank sources.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Plans for Earth Summit enter critical stage

PLANS for this year's Earth Summit enter a critical stage today as
representatives of over 160 countries gather to complete an agenda for the
June meeting in Rio de Janeiro.
The meeting, expected to last five weeks, will try to secure world agreement
on a global regime to protect the environment without applying too hard a
brake to economic growth. This will include a wide array of measures,
including an action plan dubbed Agenda 21 (for the new century) and an Earth
Charter listing rights and obligations of governments and individuals. The
Rio conference, organised by the UN, has been billed as an Earth Summit
because heads of government are invited to lead their delegations. Mr John
Major, UK prime minister, was among the first to accept.
Emphasising UK support, Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, will
address the meeting today, making clear the UK has not ruled out the use of
fiscal measures, such as a carbon tax, as part of its strategy to clean up
the environment. But he will point out the need for international agreements
to make green measures effective.
The EC has tentatively agreed on a carbon tax which it intended to propose
at Rio. But there have recently been indications that it is backing off the
idea because of lack of support outside the EC. Mr George Bush, who
campaigned in the 1988 election vowing to be 'the environment president' has
not said if he will go to Rio. His administration wants more data before
considering environmental measures that could drastically raise costs for
industry during a grinding recession.
Last week, the US pledged Dollars 75m (Pounds 42.8m) to the international
effort to reduce 'greenhouse gases' that have resulted in ominous climate
change. But the US, by far the greatest source of emissions, has yet to
consider broader incentives to curb the gases. The US has been blamed for
lack of progress on a convention on climate change supposed to be signed in
Rio.
Mr Maurice Strong, a Canadian millionaire businessman and conference
secretary-general, believes mankind's survival rests on saving the
ecosystem. With the threat of global war no longer plausible, 'the primary
issues we face today are all environment-related'. A paper for the New York
session states that underlying Agenda 21 is the notion that humanity has
reached a choice between continuing present policies or changing course to
bring about 'more productive and better protected ecosystems and a safer,
more prosperous future'.

<TEXT>
CANADA'S three main political parties have agreed on constitutional
proposals aimed at forestalling a break away by French-speaking Quebec.
The package drawn up by a 30-member parliamentary committee after five
months of cross-country hearings provides for the transfer of various powers
from the federal government to Quebec and to other provinces which want
them. Quebec would also gain a veto over future changes in the constitution.
To mollify other provinces, the committee has proposed turning the upper
chamber of parliament, the Senate, from an appointed to an elected body with
limited veto powers and wider representation from western and Atlantic
Canada.
New measures are suggested to accelerate the lowering of pervasive
non-tariff trade barriers between the provinces.
The committee's report will form the basis of complex negotiations in coming
months between the federal government, Quebec and the other nine provinces.
Mr Brian Mulroney, prime minister, aims to finalise the 'offer' to Quebec
within the next six months.

THE SLOWDOWN in economic growth rates in some leading industrial countries
was cause for concern but need not give rise to expectations of a global
recession, Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in the German Finance Ministry,
said yesterday, agencies report from Kronberg.
Mr Kohler was speaking after the final session of a three-day meeting of
officials from the Group of Seven industrial nations. He said he was
encouraged by the progress of the meeting, the second in a series of
gatherings of deputy finance ministers and other senior officials in
preparation for the G7 summit in Munich in July.
'The flattening out of growth rates is visible for everyone and there is
cause for concern,' Mr Kohler said. 'But on the other hand, the situation is
now such that one need not have the impression that we are on the verge of a
global recession.'
The world economy and the need for policies to strengthen growth, as well as
the debts of the former Soviet Union, headed the list of topics at the
Kronberg meeting, he said.
'What matters, especially for Munich, is how can we strengthen the worldwide
economic growth rates with the right policies.
'That is the key question for Munich and beyond Munich - how can we
strengthen growth with the right policies, that is, policies that reconcile
simultaneously the short-term problems with the medium-term necessity.'
Germany currently holds the chair of the G7, which also includes Britain,
the US, Japan, France, Canada and Italy.
Mr David Mulford, the US treasury under-secretary, said during a break in
the meeting on Saturday that officials had also discussed the weakness of
the yen, but had taken no decision on how to respond.

<TEXT>
POLITICAL pressure is mounting in Venezuela for President Carlos Andres
Perez to resign, and for his three-year-old government to take other radical
measures aimed at reforming the country's democratic system.
Former President Rafael Caldera, founder of the principal opposition
political party, the Christian Democrats, called on Mr Perez to step down in
order to help resolve Venezuela's 'crisis'.
Mr Perez, whose government is not scheduled to leave office until February
next year, said in a nationwide radio and TV broadcast at the weekend he had
no intention of leaving his post.
The calls for Mr Perez to resign came just over three weeks after loyal
units of the Venezuelan armed forces quashed an attempted coup by
heavily-armed army units.
Early yesterday, a small group of soldiers led by an army lieutenant
forcibly removed sub-machine guns, rifles and ammunition from an armoury at
Fort Tiuna in Caracas, according the Ministry of Defence. The incident
illustrates the ferment still existing among the armed forces.

MUTINOUS soldiers briefly seized control of the state broadcasting centre
yesterday for the third time in three days, but were ousted by other
soldiers who said they had put down a coup attempt, AP reports from Niamey,
Niger.
Soldiers drove around the city, firing into the air and frightening people
off the streets, but there were no reports of injuries.
Earlier, thousands of pro-democracy protesters yelling anti-French slogans
demonstrated against the soldiers' revolt, which they said Paris supported,
and the main trade union called a general strike.
Some 10,000 people gathered in the capital of the former French colony in
West Africa, denouncing the soldiers and demanding they not interfere with
an interim government's plans to instal democracy. They burned a flag of
France, which they claimed supported the mutineers.
Unpaid troops first revolted on Friday, seizing the broadcasting centre
twice and kidnapping two high-ranking government officials. However, they
returned to their barracks and freed the hostages after the government
promised to pay up.
Niger's 3,200 soldiers are among 40,000 government workers who have not been
paid for two months. When the interim government took over last year it
inherited a bankrupt economy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR European Community official has warned that the world is running
short of time to rescue reform in the former Soviet Union, Reuter reports
from Brussels.
Mr Frans Andriessen, EC commissioner for external relations said: 'I am
afraid we do not have much time left. We should learn something from what
happened to (ousted President Mikhail) Gorbachev.'
Speaking on his return from a tour of four former Soviet republics, Mr
Andriessen said he might urge relaxation of conditions that have held up a
Ecu1.25bn (Pounds 875m) EC loan to supply food and medicine, making it 'to
some extent a gift'.
Mr Andriessen will brief EC foreign ministers in Brussels today about his
tour, during which he heard several warnings of the risk that economic
chaos, especially in Russia, might lead to dictatorship.
Mr Andriessen dropped Russia from his week-long tour to Belarus, Ukraine,
Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan because President Boris Yeltsin was not available
to meet him.
He said an international conference on the CIS in Lisbon in May must launch
a more comprehensive policy than what he called 'piecemeal' efforts so far
if the world wanted to avoid having to arrange new emergency relief next
winter.
New aid might be needed to shore up the reformers' positions even before
May, but it was unlikely to be forthcoming until publication of an
International Monetary Fund report on the CIS economy.
He said CIS member states would send a 'positive signal' if they
co-ordinated monetary policy, set up a rouble zone and avoided trade
barriers.

THE Russian rouble yesterday ceased to be accepted by the Ukrainian state
sector for cash transactions. Salaries are to be paid primarily in Ukrainian
coupons - which have effectively become a separate currency - and all
purchases from state sectors must be made through coupons or rouble savings
in bank accounts.
Ukrainian media announced over the weekend that as of March 1, 75 per cent
of wages will be paid in coupons and the remainder will be deposited in
workers' rouble bank accounts. All purchases in the state shops of less than
Rbs4,000 are to be made in coupons. Larger transactions cannot be made in
cash, but must be paid through bank transfers. Moreover, the wholesale
sector is to switch to coupons.
The measures are a reaction to Ukraine's critical shortage of roubles and
are in preparation for the introduction of a fully separate Ukrainian
currency, the hryvnia, scheduled for this summer.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Industry chiefs warn Major on poll doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR industrialists have warned the prime minister that political
uncertainty about the timing and outcome of the election is seriously
hampering the economy's recovery.
The message that consumers and home buyers are prolonging the recession by
putting off decisions until after the election, was forcibly delivered at a
dinner Mr John Major held with industrialists last week.
The same message has been driven home at meetings ministers have been
holding with businessmen in an effort to repair the Conservative party's
relations with industry.
Senior ministers last week cited industrialists' concern that the recession
was being prolonged by uncertainty as a reason for calling the election
sooner, for April 9, rather than holding out until the summer.
Many industrialists believe strong consumer demand is being held back by
concerns that a Labour win might lead to higher tax rates, according to
interviews with more than a score of chairmen and chief executives of
manufacturing companies conducted by the FT in the past week.
Most believe that further delay in calling the election will only prolong a
recession which has proved to be deeper and longer than most companies were
expecting last year.
They fear the uncertainty created by a hung parliament could have serious
consequences, damping demand for much of the rest of the year until it was
clear whether there would be a second poll.
The election comes at a critical time for many manufacturing companies. Most
did not expect the recession to last more than 12 months. The best have come
through by cutting employment and non-essential investments.
They are now facing the question of whether to make cuts in spending on
training, research, product development and new machinery. Such cuts could
inflict long-term damage on their businesses.
Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN, engineering group, said: 'The general
unease among consumers, about issues such as the effects of tax plans, is
quite harmful. There is a danger that if the government waits for confidence
to pick up before calling an election it will just compound the unease and
delay the recovery.'
Mr Tom O'Connor, deputy chairman of Elta plastics, agreed: 'Consumer markets
need something to create a degree of confidence. Nothing will do that before
the election and a hung parliament could be very serious because that would
mean another election in 12 months' time.'
Mr Tony Firth, chairman and chief executive of Concentric, Midlands
engineering group, said consumers were financially able to buy but they were
not ready to because of political uncertainties.
Mr Stuart Moberly, finance director at McKechnie, the engineering combine,
said: 'Everything is being clouded by the election. We need to get that
uncertainty out of the way or there could be long-term problems.'
Mr John Marley, chairman and chief executive of Avdel, the fastener maker,
said the position was so grave that 'any uncertainty which is capable of
being removed should be removed.'
Mr Ian Kyd, UK financial controller of Hoover, the washing machine
manufacturer, said: 'Two things will get the economy moving in the short
term, greater confidence and some short-term spending power in people's
pockets.
'The election will make a difference in these areas but it will not be a
dramatic difference because the recession is so deep.'

FT  02 MAR 92 / Budget likely to introduce 'tax manifesto': Lamont expected
to ease the burden on savings and inheritance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, is expected to balance immediate tax cuts
designed to restore consumer confidence and spending in next week's budget
with a 'tax manifesto' for the 1990s according to ministers.
A Budget package which maps out a long-term strategy of tax reform and
offers a clear choice to the electorate was signalled by Mr Lamont's senior
colleagues yesterday as the latest opinion polls underlined the scale of the
task facing Mr John Major in the coming general election.
Measures to ease the tax burden on savings - particularly those built up by
the less well-off - and Mr Major's determination to cut the burden of
inheritance tax were singled out as likely starting points.
But there was also a suggestion that Mr Lamont could signal the eventual
abolition of capital gains tax.
The comments by ministers - a response to Labour's charge that the
government plans to use higher borrowing to 'bribe' the voters with income
tax cuts - will fuel speculation that the March 10 Budget will signpost a
range of new measures to encourage savings, to reduce inheritance tax and to
promote investment.
Ministers admit that they have been stung by the force of Labour's onslaught
on Budget tax cuts and by the link the opposition has made between lower
income tax and higher public borrowing.
There is also concern that some on the right of the Conservative party will
be dismayed by a projected public sector borrowing requirement next year of
substantially more than Pounds 20bn.
Mrs Margaret Thatcher, former prime minister, is known to be unhappy with
the sharp increase in borrowing, but has made it clear that she intends to
do nothing in the campaign which could be interpreted as helping the Labour
party.
The opposition has been cheered by a Mori survey in yesterday's Sunday Times
which was the third opinion poll in a week to show a slight shift towards
Labour and an increase in Liberal Democrat support while the two main
parties remained broadly neck-and-neck.
The same poll showed a drop in Mr John Major's popularity - hailed by Labour
as a sign that 'the Teflon is starting to peel off'. Labour has consistently
sought to pin the blame for the recession on Mr Major in his roles both as
prime minister and as chancellor.
The 'satisfaction index' - the difference between those satisfied and
dissatisfied with a politician's performance - for the prime minister is now
plus 4 per cent, compared with plus 13 per cent in January, but still ahead
of Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, whose standing is minus 18 per cent.
Overall, Mori showed Labour on 40 per cent, the Tories on 39 per cent and
the Liberal Democrats on 18 per cent.
In a letter to constituency officers, Mr Chris Patten, Tory chairman, warned
party workers that 'we have a fight on our hands', but expressed confidence
of victory 'if we defend our record, set out our vision and explain how
Labour would destroy the economic prosperity on which we all depend'.
The Tories will step up that attack today with a return to the theme that a
Labour government would mean higher prices, as well as higher taxes and
unemployment.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Wellcome share offering could raise Pounds 4.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INTERNATIONAL offering of shares in Wellcome, the drug company best known
for its Aids treatment Retrovir, that could raise more than Pounds 4.5bn at
current prices is expected this summer.
This follows a decision by Wellcome Trust, the medical research charity, to
sell part of its 73.6 per cent stake in the company.
Mr John Robb, chief executive of Wellcome, said last night that the sale
would help investors who had experienced difficulty buying shares because of
the limited number that were freely available.
This view was echoed by Mr Paul Krikler, pharmaceutical analyst at Goldman
Sachs, who said: 'This sale may well go some way to satisfying unfulfilled
investor demand'.
The trust may cut its stake to only 25 per cent, in which case the sale
would raise more than Pounds 4.5bn. However, the offer is subject to market
conditions and to the trust gaining permission from the High Court and the
Charity Commissioners to reduce its holding below 50.1 per cent.
The trust aims to retain at least 25 per cent of the company as a long-term
holding.
Wellcome yesterday confirmed market forecasts that its interim figures, to
be announced on March 26, would show a 30 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 181.2m to not less than Pounds 235m, on sales up from Pounds
731.5m to about Pounds 880m, a 20 per cent improvement. In its last
financial year, to the end of August, the group made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 402.9m.
Mr Robb said he believed the offer would enable Wellcome to build a
shareholder register that more closely matched the international spread of
its business. In its last financial year 44 per cent of sales and a higher
proportion of profits were generated in North America, but less than 5 per
cent of the shares are held there.
The trust has decided that its stake in Wellcome, worth Pounds 7.1bn and
providing 95 per cent of its income, is too great a concentration of its
assets. Wellcome's shares yield only 1.2 per cent and the trust aims to
reinvest the proceeds of the sale to earn a higher return, so making more
funds available for research. The trust is budgeting to spend Pounds 100m on
research this year.
The trust had owned all of Wellcome's shares until the company was floated
on the stock market in February 1986. At that time the whole company was
valued at just over Pounds 1bn. On Friday's closing share price of 1,126p
the capitalisation is Pounds 9.7bn.
The shares have been boosted since flotation by Wellcome's development of
Retrovir, the only widely prescribed treatment for Aids. Wellcome's biggest
selling drug is Zovirax, an anti-viral drug used to treat herpes and
shingles, which has just won approval in the US to treat chicken pox.
Robert Fleming, the merchant bank which arranged the original flotation, has
been appointed to act as global co-ordinator for the offer.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Gulf war allies may act over Iraqi Scuds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US, Britain and France have hinted strongly that further military action
may be taken against Iraq if it fails to comply with United Nations
resolutions requiring the scrapping of its weapons of mass destruction,
The Gulf war allies also hope they can topple Mr Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi
president, by harnessing domestic discontent with his regime.
Yesterday, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, underlined
mounting frustration with Iraq's prevarication over meeting UN ceasefire
terms, saying: 'We do not rule out going back to military action.'
His remarks follow those on Saturday by Mr Thomas Pickering of the US, who
read a statement in the name of the Security Council's 15 members warning
that Iraq 'must be aware of the serious consequences of continued material
breaches of' UN orders.
Iraq announced yesterday that a delegation being sent to the UN would be
headed by Mr Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime minister. He is expected to try to
avert a potentially serious clash over Iraq's latest defiance of the UN.
The US wants Iraq's delegation to go to New York by March 9. It has hinted
military action may follow if Baghdad fails to comply with UN resolutions.
The US still has 25 ships, including two aircraft carriers, in the Gulf and
more than 200 combat aircraft in the region.
The confrontation with Iraq flared over its refusal on Friday to follow
orders from the latest UN team of ballistics experts to destroy
manufacturing equipment for Scud missiles. The UN team left Baghdad in
protest on Saturday and is in Bahrain preparing a report for the UN
commission charged with overseeing destruction of Iraq's weapons.
Mr Christopher Holland, the Briton leading the ballistics team, said his
mission had been 'very successful' in finding equipment used in
manufacturing Iraq's long-range missiles, but Iraqi officials refused to
destroy machines they had identified.
Although Mr Holland declined to give details of Iraqi missile equipment, he
said it included machines 'specifically identified with the production of
missiles with ranges more than 150km'. Iraqi officials claimed the
technology had civilian uses, but Mr Holland said there was no doubt the
equipment formed a key production line for Iraq's missile programme.
Britain and France are pushing for a new Security Council resolution
instructing Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, to send a
special envoy to examine the political situation in northern and southern
Iraq. They hope an inquiry will focus grievances and help destabilise the
government.
The US, while generally sympathetic, has not yet committed itself to this
idea, fearing that any side-issue might help Mr Saddam avoid giving a
straight answer about his weapons programmes.

Property development
</HEADLINE>

THE much-predicted burst of property development along the newly-opened
stretch of the M40 between Oxford and Birmingham has still largely to take
place.
Cherwell District Council, which covers most of the area through which this
segment of the motorway runs, estimates that before the final part was
opened in January last year some 300 acres of land along the road had
received planning permission for industrial and commercial properties, but
not housing or retailing.
This broke down into 166 acres in and around Banbury, 94 acres around
Bicester and bits and pieces of land spread throughout the rest of the
district including Kidlington.
Assuming a low density of 20,000 to 25,000 sq ft an acre, which is the
average for a B1 light industrial or office development with landscaping and
car parking, this would mean at least 1m sq ft of commercial and industrial
property or around a third of what could be built along the entire length of
the M40 including Oxford and High Wycombe.
It might also mean more than a doubling of the amount of new o f f i c e and
light industrial space available north of Oxford. The Cherwell local plan
says if all the land with planning consent were to be developed around
Banbury alone, it could generate between 5,725 and 11,450 jobs.
Many of the consents have been for B1 developments, but there are also some
for B8-type development - warehouses or what property developers call sheds.
There are few B2 consents for heavy industry.
In terms of space taken up, B1 developments tend to be low density but more
labour-intensive. B8 projects are usually the reverse.
Excluding refurbishments and conversions, there has been only about 300,000
sq ft of new commercial and industrial property built between Oxford and
Birmingham.
The main developments in and around Banbury are the Banbury Business Park,
which is three miles outside the town at Adderbury. Phase one of this B1
project amounts to over 120,000 sq ft and has been developed by the Church
Commissioners for England.
In Banbury itself Blenheim Court, a modern office block of 37,000 sq ft, has
been built by Blenheim Land with the Alliance and Leicester, and Waterperry
Court, another Blenheim Land development, in conjunction with Heron Hi-Tech.
This has 15,800 sq ft of space.
In and around Bicester, the 130,000 sq ft Talisman Business Park has been
completed by the developers Scottish Metropolitan. Outside Kidlington,
Wilson Connolly has built 65,000 sq ft in the first phase of the Oxford
Spires business park, which could eventually spread over 15 acres. Many of
these developments have yet to find tenants.
Banbury Business Park considers itself lucky that Talkland, a cellular
communications group, has taken 34,000 sq ft of space. Pearl Assurance has
taken a smaller unit and two others are under offer.
But none of the suites at Blenheim Court have been let, nor have those in
Waterperry Court. The offices on the Oxford Spires estate have also to find
their first tenants.
It is not so much a question of price. Clients are wary of disclosing what
they paid for premises. But Mr John Barton, operations manager of Talkland,
said he paid less than Pounds 15 a sq ft for the space on the Banbury
Business Park.
That is cheaper than, say, Milton Keynes where B1 type property fetches
Pounds 16 a sq ft.
Blenheim Land is looking for rents of Pounds 18.75 a sq ft for suites at
Blenheim Court. 'The offices are particularly well appointed. This rent
compares well with similar quality properties in Oxford or Birmingham where
you would expect well over Pounds 20,' claims Mr Marcus Hoskins, a director
of the Oxfordshire-based developer.
Until the vacant new-build is let, it seems unlikely that further sites will
be developed at least on a speculative basis.
Thus, two sites in Banbury - one of six acres with planning permission owned
by Wimpey and another of five acres owned by Standard Life, the assurance
group - await a better economic climate before sprouting buildings.
Outside Banbury on the motorway, a 21-acre site, owned by local landowners,
has planning consent. An eight-acre site of mixed ownership, including the
Banbury cricket club, has permission for a hotel and other leisure uses. A
further 30-acre site is owned by Amec, with consent for both B1 and B8 use.
Outside Bicester, there is a 66-acre site which could become the Bicester
Business Park. The developer, London and Metropolitan, owns 35 acres of
this, on which it is possible to erect 750,000 sq ft of business space.
There are no specific plans at the moment, but Mr Martin Conway of
Chesterton, the estate agent acting for the developer, says it is
considering the possibility of non-speculative design-and-build B8
warehouses.
If action is taken to develop these various sites, does this mean that the
M40 above Oxford will become a ribbon of property development?
The answer is: probably not. Mr Donald Jelfs, the chairman of Cherwell
District Council, says: 'We have taken good care to ensure that the area is
not overdeveloped. We have not given too many planning consents in the towns
and the developments on the motorway are in clusters rather than strung out
along its length.'

FT  02 MAR 92 / Survey of North Oxfordshire (6): Farmers threaten exodus -
Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOVES to cut European Community aid to Britain's farmers could lead to an
exodus from the land, prompting a serious decline in rural areas such as
North Oxfordshire, according to the National Farmers' Union (NFU).
Farmers in the region complain they have already been hit hard by the
recession and warn that the EC's so-called MacSharry II package of
agricultural reforms, involving large cuts in the prices paid for milk,
cereals and beef, could drive many of them out of business.
After several months of falling or static producer prices in agriculture,
the reforms planned by Brussels have added to the farmers' gloom. In North
Oxfordshire the prognosis has been made worse because it has a high
concentration of the most vulnerable farming sectors: small dairy holdings,
beef farms and mixed pigs and poultry.
The region's ironstone soil, meanwhile, is not fertile enough to support
industrial-scale cereal farming and the undulating geography is too steep
for the latest machinery used in crop production.
Mr Nicholas Turner, chairman of the NFU branch in Banbury, is pessimistic
about farming prospects. 'In North Oxfordshire we don't do anything very
well. We don't have big fertile fields like East Anglia and, unlike the hill
farms of Wales, we don't qualify for aid as a disadvantaged area.
'The land won't give you fantastic yields and yet our production costs for
machinery and fertilisers are higher.'
In a bid to cut costs, many farmers in the area have decided to share
machinery, land and buildings. But these measures have pushed up rural
unemployment and led to a wholesale contraction in the farming community.
'We've come to the stage where people cannot tighten their belts any
further,' warns Mr Turner. 'If Mr MacSharry's reform plans go through, many
of our members will abandon farming.'
These NFU members are disillusioned with European quotas, agreed under the
Common Agricultural Policy, which limit the amount of produce they can sell.
Dairy farmers claim they have suffered most under the production ceilings
and many have switched to beef farming.
Livestock should be a profitable sector for the region, which boasts ideal
free-draining grassland among the 48,000 hectares under cultivation. But
prices are depressed and cattle-rearing is in danger of becoming uneconomic.
Most of North Oxfordshire's beef passes through Banbury market, one of the
largest in Europe, where up to 670,000 head of stock are sold each year.
Prices, however, are the same or less than they were 10 years ago and Mr Jim
Watson, managing director of Midland Marts which runs the market, says the
beef trade is heading for a long-term recession.
Mr Watson also blames the recession for hampering expansion of the market.
'Banbury has been hit as hard as anywhere else and we have had to make a
number of economies.
'Nobody examined their costs as they should have done during the 1980s. We
didn't and we've had to cut staff.'
The market, however, has been insulated from the worst effects of the
agricultural downturn by two developments: the EC's decision not to cut
prices paid for sheep, and the opening of the M40 motorway.
The market sells more sheep than anything else and has become the main
source of slaughter stock for Britain's wholesalers and export customers. At
busy times of the year, Banbury's sheep trade has a turnover of more than
Pounds 1m a week, with most of the stock being exported to France. 'Sheep
sales are doing better than for some years,' says Mr Watson. 'But the same
cannot be said for cattle because feeding costs have risen sharply.'
The M40, meanwhile, has transformed Banbury's links to London and the
south-east. Exporters using the M2 and M25 can now drive from Dover to
Banbury without leaving the motorway network. 'It has helped tremendously.
We've had more business as a result,' adds Mr Watson.
But in the local area, the upturn in sheep sales has not had a major impact.
Only 16 of the 614 farms in the Cherwell district are devoted exclusively to
sheep, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, while 102
farms rely on less stable dairy and beef incomes.
Faced with increasingly fragile profits from traditional sectors, many
farmers are diversifying into leisure activities. Mr Turner, a tenant farmer
for Trinity College, Oxford, has abandoned dairy production in favour of
beef, but he hopes to boost his income further by building a Pounds 50,000
golf driving range.
'More and more farmers are looking at leisure schemes like go-karting and
golf courses,' he says. 'There are also a lot of barn conversions as farmers
sell off buildings to raise capital.'
Farmers who cannot sell buildings because they are tenants or those who do
not win planning permission for leisure projects are finding it difficult to
survive. They say the problems have been exaggerated because banks are
reluctant to extend loan facilities. The prospect of subsidy-cutting EC
reforms means many farms face an insecure future, making some of them a bad
risk for banks.
'The survival rate of farms is linked to how much they can borrow,' says Mr
Turner. 'Farmers are easy targets for banks to constrict, and the banks are
making arbitrary decisions on loans.'
It is a view that is echoed by Mr Watson at Banbury market. He claims the
lenders are 'turning the screw on farmers when they should be helping them'.
Complaints over banking policy and the effect of European reforms are
expected to be aired again tonight, when farmers meet for the NFU's monthly
meeting at the Old School and Manor Hotel in Bloxham. Mr Turner has no doubt
who is to blame for the problems.
'We are all suffering because the CAP has failed. It was supposed to give
farmers a standard of living equal to industrial counterparts. But farm
incomes have declined 14 per cent in the past year.
'The European commissioners are not doing their job. Maybe we should go to
Brussels and shake them up a bit.'

Prospects for the tourist industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CHARLES I occupied Banbury after the battle of Edgehill in 1642. The town
supported Parliament, but the castle sided with the king.
The difference of opinion, which prompted the king to move his headquarters
to Oxford, cost Banbury most of the monuments which would have made it a
tourist centre. The Puritans pulled down the Banbury Cross mentioned in the
nursery rhyme and the castle was destroyed after King Charles was executed.
Subsequent generations showed no more regard for their historic sites.
Banbury's medieval church, known as 'the cathedral', was demolished in 1790
and most of the timber-framed houses were engulfed by fire.
With few major sites of their own, Banbury and the nearby towns of Bicester
and Kidlington have developed a tourist industry which relies on attractions
outside the immediate district. The towns are marketed as pleasant places to
stay for those whose main destination is Stratford-upon- Avon, Oxford or
Warwick.
The lack of accommodation in Oxford and Warwick is seen by Cherwell district
council as a good opportunity for the region's hoteliers. The council
maintains that there are attractions worth visiting, including the Civil War
battlefields and stately homes such as Broughton Castle.
Certainly, there is no shortage of hotel rooms. Occupancy rates have fallen
by over 10 per cent since 1989, a survey by the Thames and Chilterns Tourist
Board shows. The number of tourist trips to the region declined by 250,000
in the same period, says the survey.
The downturn has forced the Banburyshire Tourism Association to close. Mr
Michael Nugent, manager of the Whateley Hotel in Banbury, says the
association members were having to spend so much time trying to keep their
own businesses afloat that they couldn't do anything for tourism.
Concerned at the fragile state of the tourist industry, the council has
adopted a three-pronged strategy to attract more visitors to the Cherwell
region.
First, its brochures continue to publicise attractions outside the area to
promote Cherwell as an alternative place to stay. These non-Oxfordshire
attractions include George Washington's ancestral home in Northamptonshire
and the Cotswolds to the south-west.
Secondly, the council wants to attract more visitors on day trips and
weekend breaks. Among its rural attractions, the council lists the Oxford
canal, a popular waterway for pleasure boats, which it calls a 'linear
park'.
But weekend breaks and promotional literature pale into insignificance
against the third area where Cherwell sees tourist potential: business
trips.
With direct motorway access to London and Birmingham, North Oxfordshire
wants to attract more business visitors. 'We are well placed for the
conference trade,' says Mr Grahame Handley, chief executive of Cherwell
district council. Confident of an upswing in business tourism, the council
has given planning consent for two new hotels near the Banbury junction on
the M40 and consent for one near Bicester.
North Oxfordshire's existing hotels are not waiting for an upturn before
pursuing conference business. Of the 21 hotels listed in the district
council's tourism brochure, 20 already cater for conferences. They range
from the three-bedroom Duke of Cumberland Inn at Deddington, charging less
than Pounds 15 a night, to the 74-room Whateley Hotel offering facilities
for up to 120 people and a room rate starting at Pounds 77.
At the top end of the scale, Cornbury Park is flourishing. A large private
estate north of Woodstock, it includes Britain's largest remaining royal
hunting forest. Businessmen can book a day's shooting for up to seven
marksmen. Most 'corporate days' end with 400 birds in the bag at a total
cost of about Pounds 7,600.
But Cornbury Park's formula is unlikely to be taken up elsewhere in North
Oxfordshire. 'We are not in that kind of business,' says Mr Handley. 'What
we want is a tourist industry which caters for the hotel and conference
requirements of other businesses.
'But in the end we have to face it: tourism is not a major industry in this
area.'

FT  02 MAR 92 / Survey of North Oxfordshire (4): The Silicon Valley of motor
sport - One of the region's success stories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH OXFORDSHIRE has a flourishing specialist engineering industry based on
motor sports as a pillar of its economy.
Partly, this is because of the proximity to racing circuits such as
Silverstone, just across the border in Northampton- shire, and Donington
Park further north. But at least as important, according to Mr David
Richards, managing director of Prodrive, is its closeness to Birmingham and
Coventry, the traditional automotive centres in the Midlands.
Motor sport makes a positive contribution to the UK trade balance of at
least Pounds 300m a year, according to Mr Max Mosley, president of Fisa, the
Paris-based world governing body of motor sport.
At least three-quarters of the purpose-built racing cars in use worldwide
come from a few dozen small factories in the region. Mr Mosley himself is a
former leading light of March, the Bicester-based racing cars concern.
Indeed, virtually all the big Japanese carmakers, now using motor sport as a
major part of their marketing armoury in Europe, have their competition cars
developed not at their own factories but in these rural English outposts. As
for Mercedes' world championship sports cars, the chassis were developed not
far to the north-east of Bicester.
Almost every car taking part in North America's most famous motor race, the
Indi- anapolis 500, throughout the 1980s, was designed and built either by
March at Bicester or Lola, further north in Huntingdon.
According to Mr Jonathan Ashman, marketing director of the RAC Motor Sports
Assoc- iation, the governing body of British motor sport, 'the UK has become
the Silicon Valley of world motor sport.'
That partly explains why, hanging on the wall of Reynard Racing Cars, also
at Bicester, is a Queen's Award for Export. Mr Adrian Reynard, its
40-year-old chairman, and Mr Rick Gorne, managing director, control the
world's single biggest purpose- built race car business.
Similar awards are to be found at March and, further south at Didcot, at the
grand prix team headquarters of Mr Frank Williams, employer of Nigel
Mansell, the racing-car driver.
Many of these small companies, often to be found in the back roads of
Oxfordshire and neighbouring counties, are a breed apart.
Volume car manufacturers spend years and millions of pounds developing items
such as gearboxes and produce them in runs of 100,000-plus to make them
viable. March, Hewland Engineering, Banbury-based Prodrive and others think
little of taking, say, a complex gearbox from first design to final
production in a few months and will happily supply as few as 20.
However, even though recession has reached the industry, motor sport in
North Oxfordshire stands to benefit from the more structured shape that its
leading entrepreneurs, such as Mr Tom Walkinshaw, TWR's chairman and
Silverstone controller, appear bent on giving it.
At the 720-acre Silverstone complex, for example, there are plans to expand
an industrial park, which already houses nearly 50 units. The intention,
says Mr Walkinshaw, is to 'build up Silverstone as a hub for the British
motor industry'.
Mr Richards readily acknowledges that Prodrive is not, and does not want to
be, in the volume business. 'We might make 10 cars in a year. We therefore
need to go to specialist component manufac- turers who are prepared to make
fewer than 10 gearboxes for example. Such operators can be found in the
Midlands.'
Since moving into its 30,000 sq ft factory right on the M40 in 1988,
Prodrive has expanded its turnover fourfold up to 1991. In 1992 it is
looking for turnover of Pounds 20m.
Currently it employs 90 people. That figure should rise to 130 when the
company completes its expansion into a 14,000 sq ft factory next door to its
current site.
Mr Richards says he had difficulty in finding the right kind of engineers in
the immediate vicinity but that qualified people are happy to travel from
Birmingham or Coventry.
He says that North Oxfordshire is the best place to be for a motor sports
company. Apart from the closeness of suppliers and specialist parts
manufacturers, he reckons costs are only two-thirds of what they would be in
West Germany.
Mr Bill Donnelly, sales and marketing director at JaguarSport, a joint
company formed by Jaguar and the TWR Group, agrees that the closeness to the
automotive industry in the Midlands is important.
'We might need some custom-designed part for just three cars. Obviously, a
company used to dealing with the volume producers would not be interested in
this kind of order. But there are suppliers we can contact.'
The TWR group has its own main UK base in Kidlington. In the 1970s and 1980s
it was involved in racing development programmes for BMW, Mazda, Rover and
Jaguar with the XJS model.
Since JaguarSport was formed in 1988, one its activities has been to make
'sports' or road versions of its racing cars.
Fifty models of its feted XJR 15 have been made and all were sold at Pounds
500,000 each. It is currently making 350 of its XJ-220 model as a road car
and these will all be sold, apparently at Pounds 350,000 each. JaguarSport
employs around 90 people at Bloxham.
TWR has also diversified into other forms of specialised engineering in the
motor trade. It has consultancy engineering companies on the Continent, for
example, and has retail dealerships in Jaguar, BMW, Porsche, Mazda, and
Nissan. It employs 500 people throughout Oxfordshire and at least 1,000
worldwide.
Meanwhile Reynard, which makes between 200 and 240 single-seaters a year,
mostly Formula Fords, Formula 3, F3000 and Formula Vauxhall Lotus, is
venturing for the first time this year into grand prix, having already
produced a prototype.
The company was started in its present form in 1982, with a turnover of
Pounds 250,000. In 1990, before demand started to be hit by recession, it
produced 270 racing cars for a number of teams from its three factories in
Bicester and Brackley and had a turnover of Pounds 10m.
Mr James Linton, sales director, says: 'Being close to Silverstone is part
of the reason we are here. But it is also important to be in the heart of
the automotive industry.
Ms Fiona Miller, media manager for TWR, estimates that outside Formula 1,
around 50 per cent of the world's racing carmakers have some kind of
presence in Oxfordshire.

TALKLAND, the cellular communications company owned by France's Compagnie
Generale des Eaux, set up in the new Banbury business park last October,
becoming its first tenant.
It moved its operation, servicing its mobile phone network from Isleworth in
west London, and now employs 240 people. It is seen as an important catch in
the drive by Cherwell District Council to gain new investment and to
capitalise on the completion of M40 between Oxford and Birmingham.
Other new arrivals include Alcatel Network Systems, which has set up a small
operation in Banbury; Philips Car Stereos and Henkel Ecolab, a distributor
of chemical products, both of which have gone gone to Bicester.
North Oxfordshire is largely agricultural, undulating countryside with three
small towns and lots of pretty villages. In Banbury, the main town, with a
current population of 41,000 and a catchment population of 120,000, there
are several multinational manufacturing concerns. By local standards, they
are large employers.
They include US-owned Kraft General Foods, British Alcan Aluminium, part of
the Canadian Alcan Aluminum group, and Mannesman Demag, the UK subsidiary of
the German engineering company. There are also some distribution companies,
including the EPS group, which employs 600 people.
Elsewhere, some 1,200 are employed directly and indirectly at the Ministry
of Defence Ordnance depot in Bicester (population 20,000), making the town
an important service centre. Upper Heyford, the US airbase, is home to 1,400
US servicemen and their families.
Alcan Aluminium is the Canadian parent of British Alcan Aluminium. The
British company was first established in Banbury as Northern Aluminium in
1931. The international company has been suffering in the past year because
of a fall in the price for aluminium. The UK arm has not been immune from
the problems. British Alcan Enterprises, which forms part of the UK
subsidiary, employs 700 people in Banbury. The company feels North
Oxfordshire is a good place from which to operate.
Dr Mike Sporton, managing director of Alcan International, a related
company, which employs 176 in a laboratory in Banbury to develop group
products, points to its central position.
'On the one side there is Heathrow, and a lot of the business is
international. On the other side is Birmingham University, which is very
strong in materials sciences with an important interdisciplinary research
centre.'
Mannesman Demag, which makes travelling cranes and conveyor systems, employs
260 people, and set up in Banbury in 1969, encouraged partly by the promise
of a motorway in the near future and partly by the availability of
development assistance.
'All other things being equal, we probably would not choose Banbury now. Our
customer base was in the south, but it has moved further north. But we run a
very successful business from here. We have a good, loyal workforce and own
the property freehold,' says Mr Matthew Houston, the company's managing
director.
Mr Houston does not see other heavy manufacturing concerns moving into the
area, but he welcomes the idea of smaller technological companies arriving.
Throughout the area there are already several engineering concerns with an
emphasis on specialised engineering in motorsports.
Mr Richard Pineo, the marketing manager of EPS, which describes itself as
logistics services company, sees North Oxfordshire as a natural area for
distribution companies. It has been in Chipping Warden near Banbury since
1948 and now occupies a 64-acre site on what was once a Second World War
airfield.
Besides warehousing, the company, which has a turnover of Pounds 25m, offers
production and distribution in partnership with individual companies,
including assembly, customisation, repair, refurbishment and testing.
'Companies always knew the M40 would be developed at some stage. The
completion of the M40 means this area is ideal for companies like ours,' Mr
Pineo says.
Cherwell District Council wants to encourage more companies like Talkland to
locate in the area. Mr Rob Lee, the council's economic development officer,
says the strategy is to attract service companies which will create jobs. He
also feels that, once the economy picks up, distribution and warehousing
concerns which are not particularly labour-intensive will want to be close
to the motorway.
Unemployment in Banbury has risen to 9 per cent (about 2,000 unemployed). It
is 6.6 per cent in Bicester and 8.2 per cent in Kidlington which is
considered as part of the Oxford travel-to-work area. The ordnance depot in
Bicester is apparently not scheduled for cuts, but a rundown at the US base
has begun.
Mr Lee estimates that around 15 per cent of the servicemen will opt to stay
in the area because they have married locally, but there could still be
around 600 job losses.
Cherwell feels that the capture of Talkland is a good start in its drive to
boost its economy, and the company itself is pleased with its move, which
attracted more than 1,200 applications for the 240 jobs the company created.
Mr John Barton, operations director of Talkland, says: 'We received a very
warm welcome from the local authority. Among other things, they were
instrumental in setting up a training programme with the North Oxfordshire
College for our staff.
'When we decided to move from Isleworth, I looked at a lot of places,
including Dudley and Milton Keynes. In the end, I decided I preferred the
building in Banbury. It was also cheaper than Milton Keynes.'
Mr Philip Dobby, managing director of Alcatel Network Systems, also looked
at a number of sites.
'We needed to be close to London, because the south-east is a major customer
base for telecommunications equipment. We have a small sales office in
London. When it came to a servicing and repair centre I looked at various
places including Milton Keynes and Bracknell, and the Oxford science park.
'In the end, we chose Banbury because we wanted engineers we took on to be
able to afford houses in nice surroundings. Also, this office is cheap -
less than Pounds 15 a sq ft. It is in the town and I feel we are in on the
ground floor of the area's expansion.'

FT  02 MAR 92 / Survey of North Oxfordshire (2): The magnet of the motorway
 -Communications
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR HUNDREDS of years Banesberie, the Saxon town, was a major crossroads
between southern England and the Midlands. Its importance as a wool trading
centre made it a communications hub used by farmers and traders.
In later centuries, communications improved - first with the arrival of the
Oxford canal and then with the railways - as industry demanded better
transport links. For years, communications to north Oxfordshire and Banbury,
as it is now known, were updated and renewed to meet the needs of local
industry.
This tradition of communications growing in response to industrial
development was reversed a little over a year ago with the completion of the
M40 between London and Birmingham. Industry is now expected to grow in
response to improved communications.
Local politicians regard the motorway as a magnet for new investment and
want businesses to migrate into the area. As an incentive, about 300,000 sq
ft of new industrial and commercial premises has been built near the M40 and
the district council has set up the Cherwell-M40 Investment Partnership to
promote the region.
Launching the initiative in London, Mr Grahame Handley, chief executive of
Cherwell district council, painted a grandiose picture of the motorway's
potential. 'Cherwell and the M40 are poised to become the focus of the UK's
communications-based industries,' he said. The region has already attracted
companies such as Alcatel Network Systems and Philips, but the recession has
slowed the pace of further investment.
The council, however, remains committed to promoting light industry at
business parks such as the Banbury Cross Business Centre and Bicester's
Talisman Centre. It wants to improve access to these sites with a new
motorway junction south of Banbury and improvements to the A43
Oxford-Northampton trunk road north of Bicester.
Mr Handley also envisages the M40's first motorway service centre at Ardley
near Bicester, which will include a hotel and tourist office. Such proposals
and the planning involved have convinced the Cherwell chief executive that
the council should take control of highway planning from the county council.
'We'd like to be the unitary authority for North Oxfordshire with our own
highway authority,' says Mr Handley. 'We know the local situation better
than the county council.'
Cherwell's increasingly ambitious plans for the M40 corridor have irritated
county planners, who have reminded district councillors that the M40 is
regarded by the government as 'a centre of movement, not a centre of
growth'.
Mr David Young, director of planning and property services at Oxfordshire
county council, says Cherwell is too small to take on responsibility for
highways and criticises moves towards rapid development of the region.
Environmental concerns and fears of traffic congestion persuaded the county
to oppose Coca-Cola's planned plant at Banbury. Mr Young hints that any
similar developments encouraged by the district council could be blocked.
'This motorway is not designed for junction development and any plans for a
new junction are unlikely to win government approval.'
The county council's concerns have been echoed by planners at South
Northants Council who have criticised Cherwell for not telling them about
their junction proposals.
All local politicians, however, welcome the M40 as an important artery for
through-traffic between the south-east and the Midlands. It has eased
congestion on secondary roads and diverted freight traffic away from rural
villages.
For its part, the Freight Transport Association (FTA) says although journey
times are now faster, 'there is considerable commuter use in North
Oxfordshire which leads to congestion at peak times'.
The number of heavy goods vehicles using the motorway would be reduced, it
adds, if rail freight offered a better service to industry. The FTA says
there would be a greater mix of road-rail haulage if British Rail invested
in a new freight terminal south of Birmingham to handle Channel tunnel
traffic.
At present, rail freight through North Oxfordshire is dominated by bulk
goods such as coal and motor vehicles shipped between the Midlands and
Southampton. Diesel-hauled trains rumble through Banbury and Bicester but
rarely stop to load or unload in the region.
These diesel services should be replaced and the twin lines to London via
Oxford and High Wycombe electrified, according to the Transport Users'
Consultative Committee. The watchdog says existing rail services for both
goods and passengers are sub-standard.
The group claims North Oxfordshire will not benefit from the Channel tunnel
without rail electrification. Its criticisms are flatly rejected by British
Rail.
Electrified services from Marylebone and Paddington are unlikely even to be
considered until well into the next decade. BR, meanwhile, is investing
Pounds 260m on new rolling stock and improvements to track and stations on
the Oxfordshire routes. Journey times to Marylebone have been cut following
the introduction of new Network Turbo trains.
As a communications corridor, however, the region's rail routes are of minor
importance compared with the development of the M40.
The motorway has successfully attracted new investment, though not on the
scale originally envisaged, and it has improved access to airports at
Heathrow and Birmingham and to the south coast seaports. This six-lane road
is regarded by Cherwell district council, at least, as the catalyst for the
region's prosperity. The council's critics say Cherwell is in danger of
overdosing on the M40's potential and point out that many of the business
parks remain unfilled.
Mr Handley is unfazed. He regards the M40 as the means 'to change local
towns like Banbury, Bicester and Kidlington. We want the area to benefit and
we want developments that will create jobs.
'The M40 is changing the road geography of Britain.'

FT  02 MAR 92 / Survey of North Oxfordshire (1): Growth, right kind only -
Completion of the M40 has brought quiet market towns within reach of the
motorway network. Ribbon development has been held back by recession, while
the local authorities are trying to ensure that growth is not at the expense
of the environment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE COMPLETION of the final 55-mile phase of M40 motorway from Oxford to
Birmingham, just over a year ago, was meant to be the starting gun for a
development spurt in North Oxfordshire.
But with outline planning consent for this stretch given as long ago as
1969, plans for the area had been laid well in advance, and farmers and
landowners had done their deals with property developers at meetings in the
mid-1980s in the hotels of Banbury - the main town in the area.
Planning consents were given for more than 300 acres of land along this
newest corridor, enough, even if developed at a low density, for more than
1m sq ft of office, light industrial or warehousing space.
Yet, the concern expressed that this part of the M40 might end up with the
kind of ribbon development seen along sections of the M4, or that Banbury
might be completely ringed by business parks, putting pressure on the social
and transport infrastructure of the town centres has also proved unfounded.
It has not turned out like that, so far at any rate, because of the
recession. The take-up of land has been only a small percentage of that with
permission. Roughly 300,000 sq ft of new industrial and commercial space has
been developed, but only a quarter of this has been let or sold. Most of the
new business parks and office space stand empty.
The potential for development is definitely there. The completion of the M40
has meant that quiet market towns, such as Banbury, Bicester and Kidlington,
are now plugged into the motorway network. They are close to two important
airports, London's Heathrow and Birmingham International. They are also
between two major universities, Oxford and Birmingham. In both cases there
are research facilities for companies to lock into, as well as a supply of
graduates, some of whom will want to look for work locally.
When the economy improves, North Oxfordshire will have to compete with
Milton Keynes, Peterborough and Northampton, and even Oxford for investment.
Oxford is now beginning to emulate Cambridge by developing a science park
for businesses.
In terms of rent and wages, North Oxfordshire is competitive with these
other locations. There is also a supply of labour and more is likely to come
on to the market with the rundown of a US airbase in the area. It has good
road and air communications, although the rail links with London could be
improved.
It also has the draw that other relocation towns seeking investment, such as
Swindon, had in the early days of their expansion - an attractive
countryside with pretty towns and villages where incoming executives and
employees can live at reasonable cost.
The recession has given Cherwell district council, the main local authority
in the area, a respite to consider the kind of investment it wants and to
make sure new developments are consistent with what can be comfortably
absorbed.
The case of Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages' proposed development in Banbury
two and half years ago is still much on people's minds. Like an angler's
one-that-got-away yarn, every businessman or local government official whom
the visitor meets in the area has a slightly different variant of the story.
Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages is a joint subsidiary of Coca-Cola and
Cadbury Schweppes, which cans and distributes products from both companies.
Two and a half years ago, it was interested in a 50-acre site on the
outskirts of Banbury. It could have been a Pounds 100m investment, creating
1,000 jobs.
In the end, the company decided to buy some land outside Northampton, the
other location it examined.
Mr Grahame Handley, the chief executive of Cherwell District Council, says:
'There were genuine environmental problems. There would have been 1,800
lorries a day. The plant would have used more water than all of Cherwell
currently uses.'
Villagers in Chacombe, to the north-east of Banbury, were worried that the
prevailing winds might waft emissions from the plant.
Planning permission was not given, and, while some business leaders feel
that the episode showed an unwelcoming attitude to new investment, it has
nevertheless concentrated minds locally on what kind of development is right
for the area.
Mr Handley says: 'Attitudes are changing. We have a marvellous opportunity
to develop the area now that the M40 is open. But we want to develop it
commensurate with what it can absorb. We are not looking for a 500,000 sq ft
development employing thousands of people. The area is not structured like
that. We want companies employing around a couple of hundred people and
taking up 50,000 sq ft of office or factory space.
He talks of developing a communications corridor, and says a start has
already been made in attracting Talkland and Alcatel Network Systems.
Talkland is involved in cellular communications and Alcatel sells
telecommunications equipment. They plan to employ 240 and 80 workers
respectively.
Since he was appointed chief executive last April, he has set up an
M40-Cherwell Investment partnership with local businesses to promote the
area. He has involved the local North Oxfordshire college in training and
has tried to move on other fronts to improve the infrastructure of Banbury,
Bicester and Kidlington.
His actions have won support from the local business community. 'North
Oxfordshire now has an excellent opportunity of getting it right and
developing. Otherwise, places like Banbury will remain quiet backwaters with
ageing and increasingly dependent populations,' Mr John Bridgeman, managing
director of British Alcan Enterprises, observes.
He adds: 'Getting it right involves a more welcoming attitude to business
and achieving a critical mass in the towns, in terms of transportation and
housing and schools. I would like to see around 20 to 30 companies come into
the area, employing between 200 and 300 people each.'
This level of investment would mean about 10,000 new jobs. Banbury would
grow to a population of 60-70,000 from its current 41,000, in line with
Oxfordshire county's council structure plan, which has focused on Banbury
and Bicester, along with Didcot and Witney, as growth points in the county.
At this level the towns in North Oxfordshire would not become as large as
Peterborough or Swindon.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary and MP for Witney, has involved
himself in the M40-Cherwell initiative. 'I don't think Banbury is going to
become like the towns on the M4. It is not big enough. But it is important
to take care over the kind of growth. It would be sad if Kidlington becomes
absorbed by Oxford,' he says.

FT  02 MAR 92 / The drawbacks of shock therapy: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the dark ages of psychiatry, doctors believed that electric shocks could
cure depression. The bigger the convulsion the better: the patient would
recover that much quicker.
The professionals keenest on electrodes today are economists. In Russia and
eastern Europe, western advisers are experimenting with an economic form of
shock therapy. This consists of austere fiscal and monetary policies to curb
demand coupled with the most rapid possible freeing of prices and markets to
raise efficiency. The fashionable view is that capitalism can best be
reached in a single 'Big Bang'. In Washington last week, the merits of shock
therapy were expounded with messianic zeal by Mr Anders Aslund, a Swedish
member of Professor Jeffrey Sachs's stable of advisers to Russia.
Economic shock therapy has certainly produced impressive convulsions. In
eastern Europe, it has led to falls in production of a third or more, huge
increases in unemployment and severe distress for the weakest groups in
society such as pensioners. Wealth and income inequalities have soared.
Shock therapists like Mr Aslund are unfazed. The big falls in output - which
they did not anticipate  - are dismissed as 'inevitable'. Indeed, in true
Panglossian style every negative indicator is construed as a sign of
progress: the collapse of state enterprises, for example, simply increases
the scope for private business to flourish.
The goals of shock therapy are not in question: we all want to see strong,
market economies emerge in eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics.
But some experienced economists are beginning to wonder whether different
tactics would be more effective. The most obvious danger is that economic
dislocation will undermine progress by provoking a political backlash. This
has already happened in Poland, which has backed away from the IMF's
adjustment programme. Czechoslovakia is restive. The future of young radical
reformers in Moscow is in doubt.
Professor Milan Matejka, of the Prague School of Economics, is bitterly
critical of Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czechoslovak finance minister and a
home-grown shock therapist. He says Mr Klaus deepened the slump with
unnecessarily tight macro policies (Czechoslovakia, unlike Poland, never
faced a hyperinflation). And he complains that western journalists convey
far too flattering a picture of progress in eastern Europe because they rely
too heavily on parti pris sources - government officials and their western
advisers.
Mr Edward Bernstein, a participant at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference and
the IMF's first research director, says the shock therapists have done a
'miserable job' in eastern Europe because they have forgotten 'the lessons
of the post-war reconstruction of western Europe'. The most important was
that liberalisation had to occur in measured steps. Full exchange rate
convertibility, for example, was not achieved until the late 1950s. This
reflected the need to rebuild industrial capacity before opening the
floodgates to consumer imports. Just imagine how Britain would have faired
if it had swept away all rationing and controls in the late 1940s in an
attempt, immediately, to achieve US-style economic freedoms.
Mr Eugenio Lari, until recently head of World Bank operations in eastern
Europe, agrees that 'the pace of certain reforms was over-ambitious'. He
says reformers have tended to be 'overly purist' in advocating 'total
free-market liberal capitalism'. Coming from Italy, he understands that
subsidies, budget deficits and a big state sector - while regrettable - do
not rule out rapid growth. Long development experience makes him uneasy with
the glibness of the youthful reformers: 'we should confess to doubts and
ignorance . . . nobody understands these transitions,' he says.
Shock therapists reject comparisons with the rebuilding of western Europe,
on the grounds that former communist countries lack the basic framework of a
market economy. The point of rapid trade liberalisation is to import a price
and incentive structure. But this argument cuts both ways. The fact that
centrally planned economies lack the institutions, skills and legal
framework of capitalism surely enhances the case for step-by-step reforms.
So does the experience of Hungary, which has opted for gradual economic
reform, eschewing shock therapy even after communism collapsed. It continues
to nurture the state sector, privatises judiciously and maintains currency
controls. The result: less of a drop in living standards than elsewhere and
stronger foreign investment.
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics can surely also learn a
lesson from economic development in east Asia. South Korea and the others
were desperately poor and also lacked the infrastructure of an advanced
market economy. Did they opt for shock therapy? Of course not. Policy was
dedicated to gradually building up real-world business skills and the
strength of particular manufacturing sectors, partly by providing explicit
incentives for export. Imports, domestic consumption and finance were
closely controlled for decades.
There is a world of difference between this kind of planned development,
making careful use of markets, and a rush towards the idealised world of
free market textbooks. The formerly communist economies have to plough their
own furrow, but they should realise that shock therapy is far from a proven
remedy. A little humility on the part of the therapists would be welcome.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Delors clad in shining armour: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unless a miracle turns up, the Socialist administration of French President
Francois Mitterrand seems doomed to go down the tube in 1993. Next month's
regional elections are virtually certain to pass a damning verdict of
rejection; and the sentence of dismissal will be carried out a year later in
the general elections of 1993.
Curiously, quite a few people seem to think there could be a miracle waiting
just over the horizon, in the shape of Mr Jacques Delors, president of the
European Commission. Last summer he began to emerge in the opinion polls as
everybody's favourite politician; his popularity has now reached the level
of apotheosis, and some commentators apparently believe that he will be cast
in a starring role in a last-minute rescue drama.
The common prediction is that he will be appointed prime minister, replacing
Mrs Edith Cresson, shortly after next month's regional elections. His
international stature and his identification with solid social-democrat
values should enable him to reverse the calamitous decline in the
government's popularity. Even if he cannot avoid ultimate defeat in 1993, he
might limit the damage.
In scene two, Mr Delors goes on to succeed President Mitterrand. After his
spectacular re-entry to the French political scene, he would be well placed
to win the presidential elections in 1995. He would then call new general
elections, which would bring the Socialists back to power. QED, or (as the
French say) CQFD.
A variant of this scenario has a go-faster script. In November, President
Mitterrand holds a referendum to shorten the presidential term from seven to
five years. He announces that he will apply this constitutional reform to
himself. This precipitates an early presidential poll, before the scheduled
parliamentary elections; Mr Delors is triumphantly elected president, and
the Socialists sweep back into power on his coat-tails.
All this smacks of wishful thinking. After 11 years in power, it would be
hard for the Socialist party to make a winning come-back. It has largely run
out of political credit, and too many of its politicians are stained by the
charges of corruption that used to stick to the conservatives. Mr Delors is
popular partly because he has been out of French politics since 1985; but it
is not clear how he could resuscitate the party's reputation.
Opinion polls say Mr Delors would be the strongest Socialist candidate in a
presidential election, able to beat any plausible candidate from the
conservative opposition. The trouble is that Mr Michel Rocard got there
first: he is already the party's 'virtual' presidential candidate, and even
if the back-stairs agreement endorsing his candidacy is not formally
binding, he will almost certainly run. If Mr Delors decided to stand against
him, he would split the Socialist party, with possibly damaging effects on
the outcome.
Mr Delors says he is far too busy to think about French politics: he intends
to stay in Brussels until his contract runs out at the end of the year, and
he might stay longer if asked. Yet it is widely believed that, if President
Mitterrand were to send for him, he would obey the call of duty.
A prudent man would stay where he is for as long as possible. His most
sensible strategy would be a waiting game, until the situation becomes
clearer: the only summons that would serve his interests would be a call
from the Socialist party, since that would mean that Mr Rocard was prepared
to stand down. As it happens, he might well have the option of staying at
the Commission for a two-year extension, which would take him conveniently
up to the eve of the 1995 presidential elections.
These speculative games are fun to play, and all French commentators love
playing them. But the fascinating complexity of the possibilities of
political manipulation should not be allowed to obscure aspects of deeper
significance.
First, the unstated assumption behind these games is the extent of the
powers monopolised by the president: he and he alone pulls all the strings,
and he chooses when to pull them. These powers are not spelled out in the
constitution; but custom and precedent give the president great latitude.
President Mitterrand has taken full advantage of his opportunities; and the
consequence is that, when things go wrong, it is the president who is held
responsible.
Second, there must be a lesson to be drawn from the fact that the French
people's preferred white knight is Mr Jacques Delors. Clean, intelligent,
competent, successful - he is all these things; but it is not enough to
explain his standing in the polls. Only one thing sets him apart from most
other contenders: he is a man with strong convictions.
This cannot be said of the Socialist party, which abandoned a crude form of
socialism nearly 10 years ago, and has since relapsed into stodgy
respectability. The moderate conservative parties are just as dull. The only
strong convictions today come from the protest parties, and it is working
wonders for their voter appeal: between them, the ecologists and the extreme
right-wing National Front should get more than 27 per cent in next month's
regional elections.
Presumably, French voters want Mr Delors because a man who has answers for
Europe must surely have answers for France as well. Unfortunately, the logic
is faulty. The nation state continues to be the main locus of political
action; but the Community exists because the nation state no longer provides
as many good answers as it used to. The biggest worry for the French is
unemployment; but if the answer is faster growth, it cannot be delivered
from Paris. Mr Delors knows all this better than anyone; but he probably
still suffers from the national illusion - after all, he is French.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Money Markets and Foreign Exchanges: Attention on dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTENTION is expected to focus on the dollar on the foreign exchange markets
this week, although opinion is divided over which way it may move.
Some dealers feel that, provided the economic indicators are good, the
dollar will continue to push upwards 'Basically, the strategy is still to
buy dollars,' said Mr Michael Feeny, a senior dealer at Sumitomo Bank. Mr
Feeny said the dollar could test the DM1.66 and Y130 barriers, although
intervention at the Y130 level would impose an upper limit on the US
currency of around Y129.70. 7
Dr Mark Austin, economist at HongKong Bank, was more cautious. 'The dollar
is not quite as strong as it has been, and there is a risk that we won't get
such good economic news as we hope for. That could send the dollar a little
lower.'
The markets will be watching for the crucial US payroll figures on Friday,
as well as the National Association of Purchasing Managers' report today and
tomorrow's home sales figures.
Traders will also be looking for any sign of moves to bring the dollar down
following the G7 finance ministers' meeting on Friday and Saturday, although
indications at the end of last week were that Japan would not win support if
it pressed for a weaker dollar.
In Europe, the movements of the peseta, and the effect that has on sterling,
will be watched closely. Last week the peseta drifted down from its ERM
ceiling following a 25 basis-point cut in the Bank of Spain's intervention
rate on Tuesday. This allowed some leeway for sterling to fall against the
D-mark, and rekindled faint hopes in some dealers that a pre-Budget cut in
the UK base rate may not be out of the question.
Others, however, feel the easing of the peseta is unlikely to produce a UK
rate cut, as the associated risks are still too great.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Syndicated Loans: Banks become concerned over falling
margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REMEMBER how lending to large companies was meant to be getting profitable
again? After the paper-thin margins of the late 1980s, the capital shortage
afflicting many parts of the banking industry was meant to have led to a
rapid widening in loan margins.
That is the theory. In reality, however, margins on large corporate loans
are still far too low to bring banks a profit. And now, it seems, they could
be heading down again.
Concern about falling margins is troubling many banks active in London's
loans market. The cause of their concern is simple: demand for bank credit
remains sluggish, while the potential supply has begun to expand again as
banks succeed in rebuilding their battered capital bases.
Lending margins reached a plateau last autumn, having risen almost
constantly over the previous 12 months. As a rough norm, banks are now
lending money in the public syndicated loans market at a spread of  1/2
percentage point (50 basis points) over the London Interbank Offered Rate -
though that margin widens substantially for companies whose credit standing
has weakened during the recession, or where the lending is project-related
or otherwise non-standard.
At  1/2 -point, no banks are making money - though after tortuous internal
arguments about cross-subsidisation, many can make an argument for staying
in the loans business. The provision of a standby facility is a necessary
part of the overall range of services provided to a customer, runs this
argument: provided the overall relationship is profitable, there is no harm
lending money at a loss.
Most banks reckon they need a margin of between 1.2 and 1.4 per cent to
break even on lending to large corporates. According to Mr Alan Moore, head
of corporate banking at Lloyds Bank, a spread of 0.75 to 0.80 point is
needed just to cover cost of the bank's capital needed to support its
lending. Even that is after a fall in the bank's cost of capital recently,
from around 18 per cent to perhaps 15 per cent, he said.
Add in a margin to cover a bank's costs, the need to build a reserve against
future bad loans and a retention to allow for future growth, and the overall
cost of lending rises to well over 1 percentage point.
The recovery in bank capital is one of the main reasons why margins could
fall again. Over the last 10 days, the UK's four biggest banks have all
reported an improvement in their capital ratios. For all four, the key
tier-one ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets improved during 1990,
with all of them now at or above the psychologically important 5.5 per cent
level.
Also, some foreign banks in London are still reported to be willing to take
loans at cut-price rates. 'The problem is, there are still too many banks
around, and some of them are still looking for marginal income,' said Mr
Moore.
The demand for credit, meanwhile, is being held back in part by the slow
pace of any economic recovery in the UK and US. Many banks in London were
last autumn projecting a rise in loan demand this spring: the more prudent
are now predicting demand will be slight until at least the autumn.
Meanwhile, many of the four and five-year multiple option facilities (Mofs)
negotiated at fine rates by UK companies in the 1980s mature over the next
two years. As these are renegotiated at higher rates, banks can look for an
improvement in the overall margins on their loan portfolios. However, the
renegotiations are likely to have a perverse side-effect, if anything
helping to push banks' margins down. With commitment fees (paid by companies
on the undrawn part of facilities from banks) almost non-existent at the end
of the 1980s, at one stage touching just five basis points, many companies
took larger standby facilities than they needed, reasoning there was no harm
in having a guaranteed supply of credit on hand.
Now, though, commitment fees, like loan margins, have risen, and companies
are shrinking their standby lines. The result: a substantial release of bank
capital that had been tied up in standby facilities (banks have to set aside
half the usual level of capital for undrawn facilities.) That may drive
margins down.
There is, in short, no sign of the recovery in bank margins continuing,
unless economic conditions - and loan demand  - recover strongly, and soon.

FT  02 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Japanese utilities set to test demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL demand for dollar bonds will be tested again this month,
following January's new issue glut and a virtual famine in February.
Several big new issues are expected over the next two to three weeks. One
source of new paper is likely to be Japan, where the power utilities are
preparing to raise funds. Payment date for the bonds will be after Japan's
fiscal year-end on March 31, allowing companies to account for the
borrowings in 1992-1993.
The three biggest of Japan's nine power utilities, Tokyo Electric Power
(Tepco), Kanzai Electric and Chubu Electric, are preparing new issues.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the telecommunications utility, is also
close to launching a Eurodollar market deal.
Most of these borrowers want fixed-rate yen funding to finance domestic
operations. Hence, new Eurodollar issues are likely to be at around the
five-year maturity, where the dollar/yen swap rates are most attractive.
Each deal is likely to be of at least Dollars 350m.
There is certainly some demand for shorter maturity Eurodollar bonds from
European retail investors. This is based on the view that the US currency
will appreciate on the foreign exchange markets over the next few months,
presenting holders of dollar bonds with a capital gain.
However, big institutional buyers are keener to buy long-dated paper on the
grounds that US bond prices will rise as economic recovery falters and the
inflation outlook improves.
These buyers of longer maturity bonds were starved of new paper last month.
Eurodollar issues of over five years maturity amounted to just Dollars 2.3bn
during February, down from Dollars 6.1bn in January. With this in mind,
Japanese borrowers queueing to tap the market may be tempted to launch
longer-dated issues, even though swap opportunities are less attractive.
One borrower known to be planning a 10-year issue is the African Development
Bank. The supranational lending agency plans to make a Dollars 300m issue,
lead-managed by Swiss Bank Corporation, which will be its first foray into
the Eurodollar market.
Taken together, the market is anticipating specific new issues amounting to
at least Dollars 1.5bn, even before the month has begun. Other regular
issuers, such as Credit Local, the French state-backed local authority
funding agency, are also likely to issue if underwriting firms can match
their funding targets - in this case, around 20 basis points under the
London interbank offered rate.
It remains to be seen whether underwriting firms have learned from the
sobering experiences of January, when Dollars 8.1bn of new Eurodollar bonds,
many aggressively priced, were launched. Market rumour is that some firms
are still holding substantial inventories of unsold paper.
British Petroleum has had its Aa3 long-term credit rating placed on review
for possible downgrade by Moody's Investors Service. The agency said its
review would focus on the impact of lower oil prices on BP's financial
flexibility.

FT  02 MAR 92 / UK Gilts: Traders sit tight ahead of Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GILT market is showing all the characteristics of a rabbit caught in a
car's headlights.
Apart from Thursday's exhaustion of the Bank of England's latest tap stock,
poor trade figures and a three-point lead for Labour in an opinion poll
failed to provoke much activity in the market.
Like the rabbit, the market is showing signs of paralysis, not daring to
move until the Budget, followed closely by the election, ends the
uncertainty hanging over gilts.
The market appears to be shrugging off the bad news in the hope that some
good news will be generated by the Budget.
As Mr Mark Cliffe, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute, said:
'Everybody is looking at the Budget to provide the vital spark that will
give the Conservatives a convincing lead in the opinion polls.'
So, unless next week delivers any shock poll forecasts, it is hard to
imagine the market doing anything dramatic on the downside before the Budget
on March 10. And with little economic data next week, the market should
trade in a fairly narrow range.
All this helps explain not just the stagnation in the market, but its
general robustness in the face of a run of bad economic data.
Take the trade figures. Even with the usual government warning not to read
too much into one month's figures, January's trade deficit came as a shock.
The current account deficit virtually doubled from Pounds 409m in December
to Pounds 794m in January as the value of exports fell by 7.5 per cent over
the month. The value of imports also fell, but by less than the fall in
exports.
But reaction in the gilt market was muted. The generally positive mood was
only slightly dampened with the 2003/07 bond gaining a point on the day.
The coolness with which the markets have received the bad news suggests a
certain amount of complacency over the outcome of the general election.
Either this reflects indifference to the outcome or confidence that the
Conservatives will win. A Reuters survey of 41 economists showed they were
split between a Conservative victory and a hung parliament.
Speculation over a base rate cut will continue next week. Gilts specialists
said money market rates should fluctuate on continued hopes of a cut, but
the authorities were only likely to relax monetary policy once they had
gauged sterling's reaction to the Budget.
This means that with the Conservatives likely to announce the election by
the end of Budget week, the opportunity for cutting base rates has been
effectively limited to between March 11 and March 13, since they are
unlikely to cut interest rates during the election campaign.
The only significant activity over the week was the exhaustion on Thursday
of the Bank of England's tap stock - with a 9 per cent coupon maturing in
2012 - when gilts opened marginally higher.
The tap has acted as a ceiling at the long end of the market. Now it has
shifted, analysts say prices are free to rise higher.
With so little activity in the market, analysts were generally unable to
pin-point the reason for the tap stock's exhaustion. One suggestion was that
the market-makers had left themselves slightly short.
There was no new issuance from the Bank of England on Friday but plenty of
speculation as to how the Bank would handle issuance over the budget.
Some gilts specialists expect to see a tap tranche of around Pounds 1bn
issued at the beginning of this week, which the Bank will allow to sit on
its books, ready and waiting to be tapped by bubbly post-Budget markets. The
consensus was that it would be a short-dated tranche.
Prices crept slightly upwards last week. The 9 per cent conversion stock
(type-B), due in 2011, rose about half a point on the week, yielding 9.16
per cent at the close on Friday.

FT  02 MAR 92 / US Money and Credit: Jobs news still the dominant factor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEXT five days will test the strength of the US Treasury market's recent
rally. After a difficult February, bond investors enjoyed a good run over
the second half of last week on the heels of bad consumer confidence data
and an unexpected revival in retail demand for new Treasury stock.
From Tuesday to Friday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell from
more than 8 per cent to below 7.8 per cent. The 20 basis-point decline was
welcome, not least for those who feared higher market rates would stifle the
modest revival in the housing economy since the beginning of the year.
Whether the more upbeat mood of the market can hold this week, however, is
another matter. As is almost always the case, employment news holds the key,
in the shape of this Friday's jobs report for February.
The state of the labour market remains a dominant influence on economic
trends. The steady rise in the number out of work, and concern about
personal job prospects, has spooked consumers, so much so that spending and
confidence have remained stuck at worryingly low levels, despite the Federal
Reserve's aggressive interest rate cuts.
This is why Friday's employment report is so important. Most market
estimates call for little change in payroll numbers and a slight rise in the
unemployment rate, probably from 7.1 per cent to 7.2 per cent. The weekly
jobless claims reports for February so far have been up and down, which
suggests the overall number out of work may have held steady during the
month.
A bad set of figures, however, such as a big fall in civilian payrolls
and/or a rise in the jobless rate of more than 0.1 percentage point, could
persuade the Fed to cut interest rates again, which would be good news for
bonds, at least in the short-term.
While no one can be sure how the employment report will fall, there is one
certain factor working in the market's favour over the coming weeks: supply.
The next auction of medium and long-term securities is not due until
mid-April, which gives the market six weeks' breathing space to construct a
decent rally.
The influence of supply on recent market movements has been substantial.
Bond prices fell sharply during the first three weeks of February because
dealers had difficulty offloading billions of dollars of new Treasury debt.
Not only did the market suffer from the continued absence of Japanese
investors, but until the middle of last week (when the five-year note
auction went well) domestic retail investors were also staying away from new
Treasury issues.
Their caution was partly the result of uncertainty about the outlook for the
economy - recent data has provided an inconsistent guide to the future - and
partly because of concern the Fed and the government will over-stimulate the
economy and bring back inflation.
Investors fear over-stimulation on two fronts. They worry that election-year
pressure will produce an over-aggressive tax-cutting package that inflates
the budget deficit and loads extra supply on the market. This, of course,
assumes President George Bush and Congress can come to an agreement over
where to cut taxes and how to pay for it.
Some bond investors are also worried the Fed, scared by the depressed state
of consumer confidence and the continued deterioration of the labour market,
will overdo the interest rate cuts, accelerating the growth of money and
eventually pushing up inflation.
Judging whether the Fed will cut rates again proving difficult, thanks
mostly to Fed chairman Mr Alan Greenspan's muddled Humphrey-Hawkins
testimony to Congress.
Although he was upbeat about the economic outlook, he also described last
Tuesday's dreadful consumer confidence figures as 'quite disturbing', and
later left the impression that rates would come down again if the employment
numbers this week were bad.
Mr Greenspan's apparent willingness to ease again has drawn its fair share
of criticism. The inflation hawks' position was perhaps best summed up last
week by a comment from Ms Amanda Grantham-Hill, US economist with Paribas
Capital Markets in London, who said a rate cut would do little to enhance
the Fed's credibility. She continued, in stinging style: 'Although
guaranteeing a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, his recent
performance suggests Mr Greenspan wouldn't be offered a second interview at
the Bundesbank.'

FT  02 MAR 92 / Japanese Bonds: Growing pressure to ease monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID calls by leading politicians for an imminent cut in the official
discount rate (ODR) and further evidence of a weakening economy, yields on
Japanese government bonds have fluctuated in thin volumes.
Speculative trading by dealers created volatile movements in the bond
market. But lack of investor participation ahead of the fiscal year-end in
March has left the yield on the 129 10-year benchmark bond around the 5.35
per cent level, unchanged from the beginning of the year.
Market participants were shocked by remarks from Mr Shin Kanemaru,
vice-president of the leading Liberal Democratic Party, threatening to
'sack' Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) governor, if the ODR was
not lowered soon. Mr Kozo Watanabe, minister of international trade and
industry, has urged the BoJ to ease monetary policy on several occasions.
Traders fear pressure from politicians could delay the expected easing of
the ODR. 'Mr Mieno has worked sedulously to establish the independence of
the Bank of Japan and may want to postpone a discount rate cut,' said Mr
Marshall Gittler, bond analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. He added such a
decision could have severe repercussions in the market, since monetary
easing has already been discounted into bond prices.
Recent warnings of a downward revision in earnings for the current year by
leading Japanese companies have confirmed the mounting sluggishness of the
economy. Sony, the electronics company, recently announced it would report
an operating loss of Y20bn for the year to March, its first loss since
listing on the Tokyo exchange. Monetary growth has also decelerated to
record lows, with money supply falling to 1.8 per cent in January.
Bond market participants are now focused on the announcement of the BoJ
tankan - the quarterly survey on business sentiment  - scheduled for Friday.
The report is expected to confirm negative outlook by businesses, with cuts
in capital investment.
Mr Kermit Shoenholtz at Salomon Brothers said the tankan, fourth-quarter GNP
figures to be announced mid-March, and weak corporate earnings announcements
should be good news for the bond market. Mr Shoenholtz reckons the rate on
the benchmark bond should fall 50 basis points in the next few months.
However, a further fall in long-term rates could reduce the attractiveness
of long-term bonds for institutional investors. Trading volume of the
benchmark has already fallen to Y10,700bn in February, down from Y28,500bn a
year ago, as investors are now turning to short-term bonds and bank
debentures.
Thin volumes are expected to continue to the end of next month. Most
investors have closed down books for the fiscal year and are reluctant to
take positions. Concerns over excess supply due to corporate bond issues,
and slack demand also linger over the market.
Meanwhile, the yield curve, which flattened out last September, has
normalised. Short-term rates have fallen in line with the ODR, with the rate
on the three-month certificate of deposit closing at 5.1 per cent last week,
down from December's 6.1 per cent level.

trading

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Federal Reserve Bank of New York has said that securities firms which
meet its capital standards will be allowed to trade directly with its
foreign exchange desk.
Until now, the New York Fed has only bought and sold dollars through
commercial banks when intervening in the currency market.
The move mirrors similar reforms in the US Treasury market, where the
primary dealer network has been opened up to allow a wider range of
financial companies to trade government securities directly with the Fed.
Mr Gerald Corrigan, announcing the changes in Phoenix, Arizona, on Friday
said the Fed was trying 'to bring our relationships with foreign exchange
counterparties into broad alignment with the new procedures for primary
dealers.'
The decision to widen the Fed's trading relationships is an implicit
recognition that big securities houses such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman,
Sachs, have become significant players in the foreign exchange market.
Becoming a member of the Fed's inner circle of trading partners is a big
step for the securities firms.
From now on they will know exactly when the Fed is intervening in the
market, an important piece of information for currency dealers.

FT  02 MAR 92 / International Company News: Nokia registers FM324m loss as
sales decline 16%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOKIA, Finland's leading electronics and telecommunications group, suffered
a FM324m (Dollars 72m) loss before financial items last year, compared with
a FM711m profit in 1990.
Sales dropped by 16 per cent to FM15.5bn from FM22.1bn in the previous year.
This was mainly due to a sharp decline in demand in recession-hit Finland,
the cessation of trade with the former Soviet Union, and a weak demand for
Nokia's consumer electronic products.
The board proposed cutting the dividend to FM2.00 from FM2.80 per share.
Nokia said 1992 would provide good opportunities for growth in many areas,
but admitted there was uncertainty about the economic prospects in its main
European market areas.
The group's liquidity amounted to FM3.7bn, up from FM3.2bn, while it
invested FM868m, or 6 per cent, of its net sales on fixed assets.
Nokia's electronics business division reported a FM230m operating loss last
year, against a FM550m profit, while its sales fell to FM5.281bn from
FM6.399bn due to falling demand for televisions and video-recorders.
The operating profit fell sharply in the cables and machinery division to
FM97m from FM383m in the previous year, and sales declined to FM4.719bn from
FM5.359bn.
The group did not reveal details of its financial results in mobile phones
and telecommunications but said mobile phones had made a satisfactory return
on net assets of between 10 and 20 per cent and telecommunications a 'fair'
one of between 0 and 10 per cent.
Mobile phone sales rose to FM2.516bn from FM2.333bn. The group strengthened
its position as the world's second largest cellular phone manufacturer,
increasing its market share.

FT  02 MAR 92 / International Company News: Porsche sees profit, but fewer
sales
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ARNO BOHN, the chief executive of Porsche who threatened to resign unless
the supervisory board renewed his contract beyond the end of this year, said
the company faced hard times but would make a profit this financial year.
His statement comes at a time of renewed speculation about the future of the
German luxury sports car company. Toyota, the Japanese motor group, denied a
report in a German magazine that it had offered DM5bn (Dollars 3bn) to buy
Porsche.
After Mr Bohn's ultimatum, the supervisory board confirmed his contract
would be extended for a further three years after December. This was done at
a meeting on Wednesday of the non-executive board, which contains
representatives of the controlling Porsche and Piech families.
Mr Bohn made no comment about the attitude of the supervisory board, which
had failed to confirm, by the necessary two-thirds majority, at its previous
meeting last week that his contract would be extended. Wednesday's vote,
which only needed a simple majority, was unanimous.
He said Porsche would sell fewer cars this year than the 26,200 sold in
1990-91.
However, the Stuttgart-based company would gain a new impetus in the
mid-1990s with its new sports car, which would be cheaper than those in its
present range, though still aimed at wealthy buyers.
In its last financial year to July, 1991, Porsche's net profits plunged by
70 per cent to DM17m as a result of both falling sales and provisions of
around DM60m to cover future business risks and job cuts.
The company is putting 4,000 of its 9,000 employees on short-time between
April and June. It is also shedding 550 production workers.

<TEXT>
AXEL SPRINGER, one of Germany's leading media groups, will pay no dividend
for 1991 because of losses in foreign operations and high start-up costs in
the east German newspaper market.
The payout last year was DM12 a share. After-tax profits, which fell to
around DM20m (Dollars 12.5m) compared with DM65m in 1991, would be paid into
reserves, the company said.
Turnover during the year had increased by only 4 per cent to DM3.7bn.
Springer last year started a restructuring programme under its new chairman,
Mr Gunter Wille, which included the closure of a Spanish tabloid newspaper,
Claro.
Later this year, the loss-making Die Welt will move offices from Bonn to
Berlin and will be given a complete face-lift aimed at boosting sales,
currently 230,000 a day, and lifting advertising revenues.
The paper, a conservative daily, comparable in tone with The Times in the
UK, is believed to lose more than DM40m a year.
While the management wants to brighten up the paper with a new look,
comparable with that of USA Today, the editorial staff would prefer to keep
the sober image and increase pagination.
The group, in the middle of a DM800m printing press investment programme in
east Germany, is also being hit by losses on daily papers taken over in
Rostock and Leipzig.

<TEXT>
GRUPO Financiero Bancomer (GFB), the holding company comprising Mexico's
second largest bank, announced that it is to offer Dollars 500m of its stock
in the US and European markets in the coming weeks, in part to enable it to
meet a final payment of Dollars 1.73bn due to the Mexican government by
April 6.
A group of investors headed by Mr 'Don' Eugenio Garza Laguera, whose family
owns around 85 per cent of the large conglomerate Grupo Visa, bought 56 per
cent of Bancomer from the Mexican government last year for a sum that has
risen to Dollars 2.88bn, after including accumulated interest on outstanding
payments.
Grupo Visa in turn owns 60 per cent of Femsa, best known for its breweries
that provide Mexico with half its beer.
Mr Laguera's bidding group borrowed Dollars 600m last October from JP
Morgan, the US investment bank which is managing the equity deal, to meet an
earlier payment.
The bridge loan was secured against assets in Femsa.
Mr Othon Ruiz, chief executive of Visa, said Femsa had received binding
proposals in the soft drink and packaging businesses (of Femsa) which would
enable them to pay back the bridge loan soon.
Femsa owns the Coca-Cola franchise in Mexico City, the largest such
franchise in the world.

<TEXT>
CORPORACION ALBA, the Spanish holding company controlled by the powerful
March family group, is seeking to sell its 15.5 per cent stake in Signet
Banking Corporation, the US bank.
The disposal of the conglomerate's financial arm in the US comes in the wake
of its plans to raise as much as Pta50bn (Dollars 277m)from the sale of its
electric utility interests in Spain. The move also underlines an apparent
strategic shift by Alba aimed at realising as many of its assets as
possible.
The March group, run by brothers Juan and Carlos, has denied reports it is
seeking to sell its retail banking network, Banco Urquijo.
It is understood, however, to be seeking a partner for its investment
banking subsidiary Banco de Progreso, both of which come under the
Corporacion Alba umbrella.
Alba's consolidated net profits last year fell to Pta10.4bn. The decline was
blamed on the reduced income of its Aragonesas chemical group which owns the
utilities that have been put on the market.

FT  02 MAR 92 / International Company News: Japanese tyre-makers decline

<TEXT>
YOKOHAMA Rubber and Sumitomo Rubber, leading Japanese tyre-makers, reported
lower pre-tax profits for the year to end-December, blaming the decline on
increased personnel costs linked to Japan's labour shortage and higher
interest rates.
Yokohama Rubber said pre-tax profit fell 14.7 per cent to Y12.74bn (98.2m),
although total sales rose 3.2 per cent to Y295.15bn and sales of tyres rose
4.8 per cent to Y211.6bn, despite the downturn in Japanese car sales last
year.
In common with many other Japanese companies, Yokohama reported a fall in
liquid assets, particularly in cash, which declined from Y16.8bn to Y5.35bn.
Companies, unable to raise new funds on an ailing stock market and balking
at higher interest rates, tapped their liquid assets.
Yokohama expects the weakness in the Japanese vehicle market to be reflected
in slower sales this year, but is hoping new products will stimulate demand.
It said the 'difficult conditions' would be exacerbated by an appreciation
of the yen and an increase in trade friction.
For the year, Yokohama expects sales to rise by about 3 per cent to Y305bn,
with pre-tax profit slightly lower at Y12.3bn, and after tax profit falling
from Y6.9bn to Y6.7bn.
Sumitomo Rubber reported a 1.7 per cent decline in pre-tax profit to
Y11.54bn on a 3.9 per cent increase in sales to Y254.36bn.
The company said that sales rose for new product lines, particularly tyres
for snow conditions, while sales of sports and related equipment advanced
7.5 per cent during the period.
This year, Sumitomo is predicting an almost 6 per cent increase in sales to
Y270bn and a slightly higher pre-tax profit at Y12bn.
After-tax profit, which rose 30.2 per cent to Y7.2bn last year is expected
to decline to Y6bn.

INTERNATIONAL Paper, the US paper group, is to buy 11 per cent of Scitex,
the Israeli manufacturer of computer imaging equipment, for Dollars 209m.
Scitex will sell the New York-based International Paper 4.75m newly-issued
ordinary shares in a private placement.
The deal is still subject to the final approval of the respective boards of
Scitex's two major shareholders - IDB Holding Company and Clal - and of
International Paper. Each group would hold about 11 per cent of the shares
in Scitex.
Mr Arie Rosenfeld, Scitex's president and chief executive officer, said
Scitex and the imaging products division of International Paper were already
considering joint development projects, incorporating Scitex electronic
imaging technology with International Paper's film, plate and consumables
know-how.
Scitex, Israel's most profitable company, announced a net profit of Dollars
100.6m, or Dollars 2.70 per share, for 1991, an increase of 31 per cent over
the previous year.
The company, whose shares are traded over-the-counter in New York, increased
its revenues 22 per cent last year to Dollars 430m.
Several months before his death, the late Mr Robert Maxwell had sold his 20
per cent holding in Scitex for Dollars 250m in order to help ease his debt
problems elsewhere.

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CADILLAC Fairview, the Toronto-based property developer, will bid for
control of a troubled chain of Canadian clothing stores. The move reflects
the ripple effect of the North American retailing slump on shopping mall
owners.
The bid will keep the 118-store Grafton-Fraser group in business, including
25 outlets which are key tenants in Cadillac Fairview shopping centres.
CF and a senior Grafton-Fraser executive plan to buy a 90 per cent interest
in the chain, which is operating under the protection of the Company
Creditors Arrangement Act and has already shrunk to about half its previous
size. CF and its partner will provide up to CDollars 6m (USDollars 5.45m) in
bridge finance to Grafton-Fraser.
Earlier this year, CF and a group of other shopping centre landlords
threatened to put Grafton-Fraser into bankruptcy if they were not consulted
about the company's restructuring plan.
The developers feared Grafton and other troubled retailers were using the
Creditors Arrangement Act, which is similar to Chapter 11 of the US
bankruptcy code, to pick and choose which leases to maintain, based on the
traffic through individual shopping malls.
The mall developers are especially concerned about the viability of
relatively new shopping centres in outlying suburban areas which were built
in the latter stages of the last property boom. Many of these malls have
high vacancy rates and remaining tenants are having difficulty paying the
rents which they locked into three or four years ago.

FT  02 MAR 92 / International Company News: Swedish banks to buy Fermenta
unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM of Swedish banks has agreed to buy Independent, the financial
subsidiary of Fermenta, the Swedish industrial group, for SKr1. The proposed
deal will enable Fermenta to continue its other business activities in
health care and property.
The preliminary agreement ends two weeks of intensive negotiations between
Fermenta and the banks. The talks were the result of Independent suffering
heavier-than-expected losses last year which halved its share capital.
Under the deal, Fermenta has also agreed to buy for SKr350m (Dollars 59.3m)
Independent's 99 per cent stake in Elector, the Swedish property company,
and its 13 per cent stake in the Spanish real estate company AFISA, as well
as Independent's outstanding loans to Elector.
For its part, Independent is selling its shares and options in Independent
Estates, its English property company, for SKr1 and at the same time
relinquishing its remaining claims on Estates which has a book value of
around SKr111m.
Through its acquisition of Elector, Fermenta will acquire properties valued
at around SKr700m, although the company said there may have to be a downward
adjustment of their assets by between 10 and 20 per cent this year.
Both sides said they hoped the agreement would provide the financial
conditions for Fermenta to carry on. The biotechnology company has had a
troubled history since it was founded in 1986 by Mr Refaat El-Sayed, who was
convicted of fraud and sent to prison.
In November 1989, it launched a bid to become a large finance company when
it merged its subsidiary Independent with Infina in a deal worth SKr1.8bn.
For a time it seemed to have thrown off the stigma of financial scandal with
a 128 per cent rise in profits in 1989 to SKr251m.
But by the autumn of 1990 it was being hit badly by the growing troubles in
Sweden's finance sector caused by a liquidity squeeze.
Last September, Fermenta's chairman and chief executive were forced to
resign after failing to report certain share transactions to the Fermenta
board and a bank consortium agreed to provide Independent with a SKr4bn
credit line until April 1993.

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RABOBANK, the Dutch co-operative bank, posted a 4.2 per cent rise in net
profit last year, about half the rate of growth seen in 1990.
Net profits increased to slightly more than Fl 1bn (Dollars 312.5m) from Fl
971m in 1990, when profit had shown an 8.1 per cent rise.
The Netherlands' second-largest bank, which is not listed on the Amsterdam
bourse, said that it was likely to register some profit growth in 1992,
despite an expected lower rate of lending which was caused by the slowdown
in the economy.
Gross profits in 1991 were up 8 per cent at Fl 2.18bn.
Higher taxes and a bigger allocation to general provisions against risks
accounted for the slower rate of growth at the net profit level.
Rabobank described 1991 as a satisfactory year on balance, noting that
banking activity and lending were barely affected by the less favourable
performance of the Dutch economy.
Lending to the private sector showed a 9.6 per cent rise in 1991, down only
slightly from the 10.2 per cent increase in 1990.
However, Rabobank's costs rose faster than revenue, due mainly to higher pay
awards in the Netherlands' banking sector.
Total costs were up 13.8 per cent at Fl 4.39bn while total revenue posted an
11.8 per cent gain to Fl 6.57bn.
Rabobank, which is pursuing a cost-cutting programme, said costs were
expected to show a slower rate of growth in 1992 than in 1991.

FT  02 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Gt Portland sells Bride Hall stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT Portland Estates, the property investment company, has sold its 50 per
cent stake in Bride Hall, the developer and trader, in a complex deal.
Great Portland is making a loss of Pounds 14m on the sale of its stake to a
trust of Mr Danny Desmond, its partner in Bride Hall for an initial Pounds
500,000. As Great Portland is withdrawing from development for trading
purposes it is treating the loss as an extraordinary item.
Great Portland is also buying one of Bride Hall's properties in the Euston
Road, which has just been valued at Pounds 22m, for its full acquisition and
development cost of Pounds 29m. Great Portland will charge Pounds 700,000 of
the loss to its trading profits for the year to March 31 1992 and will take
Pounds 8m to its revaluation reserve.
The 65,000 sq ft Euston Road building, one of the largest schemes in Bride
Hall's portfolio, is pre-let to Gestetner Holdings. In 1987 Great Portland
provided a guarantee to Barclays Bank for the project and agreed to make
good any shortfall between the amount owed and the proceeds from the sale of
the building, without recourse to Bride Hall.
Great Portland is raising Pounds 30m by a further issue of 10 3/4 per cent
First Mortgage Debenture Stock 2021 to finance further property investment
and development.
The company confirmed its intention to maintain its dividend.

Fleming Income &amp; Capital Investment Trust has raised Pounds 92m in its offer
for subscription, indicating that investors recent enthusiasm for investment
trust launches has yet to be sated, writes Philip Coggan.
The trust, like many other recent offers, had a split capital structure, and
was linked to a Personal Equity Plan (PEP). Income and capital gains made
within a PEP are free of tax.
Fleming said it received applications for 25.7m package units (comprised of
one ordinary income share and one zero prerefence share) and 45.5m ordinary
income shares. In addition 20.5m package units, 200,000 ordinary income
shares and 45.8m zeroes have been placed with investors.
PEP applications were received in respect of 18.1m package units and 38.6m
ordinary income shares.
Investors can place Pounds 6,000 into an investment trust new issue PEP in a
tax year. This is double the allowance that can be put in an existing
investment trust and the result has been a burst of new issue activity in
the sector.

FT  02 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Drug problem damages corporate health - The
tribulations of Fisons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN AIR of bruised defensiveness haunts the boardroom of Fisons these days.
The group, which is likely to report tomorrow a drop in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 230m in 1990 to around Pounds 190m last year, is still coming to
terms with the resignation in January of Mr John Kerridge, its executive
chairman. A US ban on two of its best-selling products, which has cost it
more than Pounds 65m in lost profits, continues to torment the company.
Meanwhile, Fisons' relationship with the City of London remains sticky.
A romance lasting nearly a decade of sustained growth turned sour in the
closing months of 1991 as it became clear that visits by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), which controls which drugs are sold in the US,
had uncovered a series of manufacturing problems.
In addition, institutions became exasperated at the persistent failure of
Tilade, the asthma drug and the company's great hope for the 1990s, to gain
US approval. Repeated promises that the drug was on the verge of approval
were broken. Nearly two years later the City is still waiting.
If that were not enough, investors received a series of nasty surprises
during the autumn of 1990. The company announced progressively increasing
losses arising from the absence of two other drugs, Opticrom and Imferon,
from the US market.
This culminated in the profits warning on December 11.
Mr Patrick Egan, newly appointed executive chairman, admitted this week that
the company had two pressing problems - a replacement for Mr Kerridge and a
speedy resolution to its seemingly incessant differences with the FDA over
manufacturing quality standards for Opticrom, a hay-fever drug, and Imferon,
a product for anaemia.
The difficulties with the FDA continue. Mr Egan has said the company does
not yet have a date for the visit by FDA inspectors. Analysts had once
expected the visit to take place in January or February. A date of mid-March
was then mentioned, but there is now speculation the inspectors may not
arrive until April.
Mr Egan denied there had been a break-down in the relationship with the FDA,
but admitted there had been slippage in the timing of the FDA visit.
He argued, however, that the date was no longer critical because the company
has missed the spring hay-fever season for Opticrom. The product should be
ready in time for the autumn ragweed season which runs between September and
November. This period formed the bulk of Opticrom's sales, he added.
Before the withdrawals, Opticrom had annual US sales of about Dollars 40m
while Imferon's sales were about Dollars 20m.
Meanwhile, Mr Egan is busy searching for a chief executive. He said he was
considering internal and external candidates and expected to make a decision
within the next six weeks.
Mr Egan stressed the company's underlying strength and argued that the
set-back was only temporary. He insisted the company had a strong pipeline
of drugs in the two fields in which it plans to specialise - respiratory and
central nervous system pharmaceuticals.
He admitted, however, that the company did not have the resources to develop
all of the drugs it discovered, particularly outside its core fields. He
expected an acceleration in co-development projects with other companies as
well as an increase in the number of products Fisons licenses out.
Nevertheless, he argued that the company had critical mass for its research
and development although it was spending only Pounds 80m a year. 'We don't
need to be merged and we don't need to be taken over. We're operating quite
nicely,' he said. 'I have ruled out a merger with a company of the same size
or a larger group.'
Mr Egan also said he was not under pressure to sell the scientific
instrument division or the horticultural business, even though he was
receiving an offer a week for the latter. He was not actively soliciting
offers, he added. However he did say he might dispose of bits of the company
if he was under pressure to fund drug development.
Meanwhile, Fisons is trying to repair bridges with both the City and the FDA
following the ban on its drugs. Both must relearn how to trust the company.
Mr Egan and whoever he chooses as chief executive will have plenty to do
before Fisons feels less battered and bruised.

FT  02 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Redland resumes attack on Steetley's
European quarries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDLAND, which this week expects to hear that it can proceed with its Pounds
600m contested bid for rival UK building materials group Steetley, yesterday
resumed its attack on the quality of Steetley's continental European
aggregate business.
Mr Peter Lilley, the trade secretary, is expected to announce within the
next few days that Redland has given sufficient undertakings - to dispose of
businesses where it would acquire a dominant market position  - to allow the
takeover to proceed. Redland has offered to sell two brick plants in
south-east England and to dispose of Steetley's clay tile operations if its
offer for the company succeeds.
Under takeover panel rules, Steetley must publish its final defence document
within two days of the bid being cleared by Mr Lilley.
Redland, which has hired external consultants to investigate Steetley's
quarries in France and Spain, said yesterday that the Spanish reserves were
lower than Steetley had implied when it bought the business in 1988. The
group said that inspection of the sites, geological studies and interviews
with local people had revealed that the Spanish reserves were no more than
30m tonnes. Of this, only half was likely to get planning permission because
some of the sites would be affected by plans to establish a nature reserve
in the area.
When it announced the purchase of five connected companies in the Madrid
area for Pounds 24.6m Steetley said there were 30 years of proven sand and
gravel reserves at current production rates. Redland said that this had
implied reserves of at least 48m tonnes. It estimated that Steetley had
earned profits of Pounds 7m on its Spanish businesses last year 'despite
having invested between Pounds 60m and Pounds 70m in Spain since 1988.'
Last week Redland also claimed that Steetley's French aggregate reserves
were also much less than the group had previously indicated.
Mr Richard Miles, Steetley's chief executive, said last night: 'This
increasingly strident barrage of asset bashing is a deliberately misleading
attempt at scaring our shareholders into parting with their assets on the
cheap. It of course avoids mention of Steetley management's proven ability
to deliver above-average earnings.'
He said Steetley would provide a breakdown of its asset value and earnings
potential 'at the appropriate time, and not before.'

FT  02 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Hillsdown to float part of Fairview
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HILLSDOWN Holdings, the diversified food group, is preparing to sell part of
Fairview New Homes, its housing subsidiary, in a flotation that could fetch
Pounds 100m.
The move is in keeping with Hillsdown's decision two years ago to
concentrate on its core food business, which accounts for more than 80 per
cent of the group.
It has delayed selling the housebuilding subsidiary because of a reluctance
to sell the business at the bottom of the cycle.
The sale is likely to take place later this year or in early 1993 - although
the exact timing will depend on the state of the stock market.
'The condition of the market will dictate the timing,' said a Hillsdown
spokesman. 'We don't need the money; we are not pressured to complete the
sale.'
Fairview, which specialises in London flats for first-time buyers, has cut
its margins but continued to make profits during the recession.
Hillsdown is planning to make several in-fill acquisitions, priced between
Pounds 25m and Pounds 50m, in the food business.
The group will announce its 1991 figures on March 11. The City is expecting
a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 191m to below Pounds 185m.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Economics Notebook: Little for Lamont to crow about in
needle match
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont has had little to crow about recently.
One of the few achievements about which he has been able to boast was the
opt-out clause in the Maastricht Treaty that gives the UK the right to
decide whether or not to move to stage three of European economic and
monetary union, with its single European currency and central bank.
However, it now looks as if Germany is going to make its move to the final
stage of Emu in the late 1990s depend upon decisions of its own parliament
without having bothered to negotiate a special protocol at Maastricht.
Moreover, Germany is likely to use its emerging hard-line approach on Emu in
support of its efforts to base the planned European central bank in
Frankfurt rather than in the City of London, or elsewhere in the community.
When the Maastricht treaty comes before the German parliament for
ratification this year, it is expected that both chambers of parliament  -
the Bundestag and Bundesrat - will demand the right to 'take stock' of Emu
in 1996 before moving to the third and final stage of the project.
German monetary officials insist that they will not be seeking the
equivalent of Britain's opt-out clause. But parliamentary pressure will
clearly be used to ensure that Emu does not fall short of the traditional
German goals of price stability and tight monetary management.
It is also becoming increasingly apparent that the German authorities regard
the location of the future European central bank in Frankfurt as an
important guarantee that Emu will conform to German standards.
The sub-fusc world of European central banking does not normally witness
heightened passions. But something approaching a needle match has broken out
between the Bundesbank and Bank of England over the site of the European
central bank.
Both institutions realise that in the long term it could determine where
Europe's premier financial centre will be based.
Last week, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the deputy governor of the Bundesbank, raised
the stakes on Frankfurt's behalf by saying that the European Monetary
Institute - the forerunner of the ECB  - should be based in Frankfurt to
compensate Germany for the loss of the D-mark in the move to Emu. He pointed
out that the decision about where to base the EMI has to be made this year
and the city which lands the EMI is generally expected to be the home of the
ECB. 'A decision for Frankfurt would be a demonstration by Europe that
European monetary policy would follow the German tradition of stability and
the single European currency would be a worthy successor to the D-Mark,' he
said.
Such statements could be dismissed as so much fine rhetoric, if it were not
for the fact that Emu will be a hot topic in the German parliament this
year. Having woken up late to the implications of the Maastricht treaty for
the D-Mark, the German public and media are not going to let the treaty's
ratification pass without subjecting it to fierce scrutiny and conditions.
Already German officials are warning that the pressure of public opinion
would make it very difficult for the Bonn government to approve placing the
EMI and the ECB outside Frankfurt.
Such warnings have serious implications for those of Germany's EC partners
(all except Britain and Denmark), which have committed themselves to Emu. If
they do not back Germany in its wish to have Frankfurt as the home of the
ECB, they could find Europe's most powerful economy threatening to stay
aloof from the project when the German parliament 'takes stock' of Emu in
1996.
Last month, Mr Lamont told the Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee
that Britain would argue for the EMI to be based in the UK. There are
doubtless many reasons for pressing such a case - not least the strong
position that the City has built up in markets for the Ecu, the embryo EC
currency.
But will the other EC member states defy Germany over the home of the ECB if
Emu itself is at stake?
And why should they support London, so long as Britain's commitment to Emu
is still hedged by the opt-out clause so carefully negotiated by Mr Lamont?
Costly support
RARELY can a Budget have generated so much heat in advance as that which the
chancellor will deliver next week. But with attention focused on likely cuts
in personal income taxes, the pros and cons of suggested tax breaks for
industry have been neglected.
One idea supported by organisations as diverse as the Confederation of
British Industry, the Engineering Employers' Federation and the Labour Party
is an increase in depreciation allowances on plant and machinery investment.
The three groups differ over precisely what changes they would make to
existing corporation tax allowances to boost investment. The CBI wants a
permanent 40 per cent depreciation rate rather than 25 per cent at present.
The EEF wants at least 40 per cent, rising to 100 per cent by the mid-1990s.
The Labour Party has still to make a final decision. But it has toyed with
temporarily increasing the depreciation rate on plant and machinery to 40
per cent and has considered the possibility of a temporary 100 per cent
allowance.
Until now, little attention has been given to the cost of such measures. But
work by the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests it could be
high. The IFS calculates that a permanent change to 40 per cent in the
Budget would reduce tax revenue by Pounds 2bn for two years starting in
1993-94 and cost around Pounds 11.6bn over 10 years.
A temporary 40 per cent allowance for one year would cost Pounds 2bn in
1993-94 while a 100 per cent temporary allowance would cost nearly Pounds
11bn in 1993-94. However, the high initial costs of the temporary schemes
would be offset by lower claims on allowances in later years so that around
60 per cent of the one-year cost would be clawed back.
Even so, the IFS argues the state would find it was helping to finance much
investment that would take place any way. It would also run the risk
inherent in all stop-go policies of applying a temporary tax boost when the
economy might be recovering of its own accord. Taken together, these
considerations might enhance the attractions of other ways of helping
business in the Budget - such as easing the burden of the uniform business
rate, which hits all companies, whether they are making a profit or not.

FT  02 MAR 92 / McDonnell faces doubt on Taiwan stake deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MCDONNELL Douglas of the US is facing increasing difficulties in its
attempts to sell 49 per cent of its commercial aircraft business to Asian
partners. This raises doubts over the company's plans to launch later this
year the development of a new 350-400 seater jumbo aircraft, the MD-12, to
challenge Boeing in the large airliner market.
The growing uncertainty over the future of McDonnell Douglas' commercial
aircraft activities follows a statement by a senior executive of Taiwan
Aerospace, which has been negotiating to take a stake of up to 40 per cent
in the US company's civil aircraft business for Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn)
that it may buy only 25 per cent. The statement by Mr Liu Kuo-Chih,
vice-president of Taiwan Aerospace, in a news agency interview on Friday hit
the price of McDonnell Douglas shares, which closed Dollars 2 1/4 down at
Dollars 63 1/2 .
The decision would make it financially harder for McDonnell Douglas to
develop its new MD-12 jumbo airliner, a direct competitor to the Boeing
747-400.
Mr Robert Hood, president of the company's Douglas Aircraft subsidiary, said
at the Singapore Air Show last week that the company was talking to other
Asian nations about taking a bigger stake in the company's commercial
aircraft business.
He remained optimistic that Taiwan Aerospace would raise the Dollars 2bn for
a 40 per cent stake, but also conceded that other Asian countries might end
up taking part of the shares originally intended for Taiwan.
McDonnell Douglas has been in discussions with investors in Japan, South
Korea, Singapore and Indonesia as well as Taiwan. The three Japanese
aerospace groups, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries,
and Fuji Heavy Industries, have so far responded unenthusiastically to
McDonnell Douglas. They have also been approached by Boeing and the European
Airbus consortium.
McDonnell Douglas announced last year it planned to complete its deal with
Taiwan by the end of January. But Mr Hood indicated in Singapore that he now
expected the deal to be completed by the end of this year.
McDonnell Douglas, anxious to see off opposition in the US Congress on
national security grounds, said there would be only limited technology
transfer to Taiwan. This has led Taiwanese politicians to claim the country
should be getting more.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Robinson seeks 20% cuts at Granada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gerry Robinson, the new chief executive of the Granada group, has called
for a 20 per cent cut in costs at Granada Television after inflation, in
spite of being warned this could not be squared with the company's
broadcasting licence obligations.
In a strategy paper to the Granada board at the end of November, Mr Robinson
said a 20 per cent cut in the nine months to September 1992 would increase
Granada Television's profits from Pounds 22m to Pounds 54m.
'We believe that the cost base is high and something in the order of 20 per
cent real reduction is achievable given the will to do so,' Mr Robinson
argued.
It was the call for such deep cuts, combined with a demand for 300 further
redundancies in the 1992-93 financial year, that led to the resignation of
Mr David Plowright, the distinguished chairman of Granada Television. He
left the company on Friday after 31 years with no financial settlement yet
agreed.
The Robinson paper was written after Mr Plowright warned that a doubling of
Granada Television's profits was unrealistic if the company was to meet the
terms of its new broadcasting licence.
In January Mr Plowright and Mr Andrew Quinn, the new chief executive of
Granada Television, agreed to 100 job losses to save Pounds 6m a year.
In the strategy paper Mr Robinson said that agreements with the Independent
Television Commission should be honoured. He said that not only should
Granada Television tackle its cost base, but everything possible should be
done to reduce the cost of the national ITV network schedule.
He has since been told that more than half the costs of ITV are fixed,
including payments for the network, transmission and Independent Television
News. Mr Robinson was seeking 20 per cent cuts overall, which would have had
to come out of 40 per cent of Granada Television's spending.
Mr Robinson's other targets for cost cutting include Granada Television's
central Manchester studios and the group's trunk-road service stations and
hotels.
'We have a huge site in Manchester that is on balance something of a
liability because it is far in excess of our needs and is expensive to
operate,' Mr Robinson said in the November paper. A move to smaller premises
was advocated, although this could jeopardise Granada's theme park and
studio tour.
Mr Robinson believed Granada's motorway services will remain profitable. But
on the more recent move into trunk-road services he said: 'The future of
trunk roads and associated hotels is doubtful.'
The chief executive praised recent improvements in Granada's computer
services, argued that opportunities in ten-pin bowling were not being fully
exploited and called for better margins and vigorous cost cuts in the
television rental business.
Mr Robinson and Mr Alex Bernstein, Granada chairman, come up for election at
Granada's annual meeting tomorrow.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Ex-chief of Eagle Star to advise on mergers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Butt, who left his job as chairman and chief executive of Eagle
Star under a cloud last September after the UK insurer had announced
first-half losses of Pounds 189m, has joined London-based corporate finance
boutique Phoenix Securities to advise on mergers in the insurance industry.
Mr Butt, who spent five years in charge of Eagle Star, said yesterday he
expected rationalisation in the industry to generate of mergers, especially
in Europe. 'There are too many players with capital spread too widely,
backed up by insufficient underwriting expertise,' he said. 'There are 4,000
companies in Europe. We need about 500.'
Phoenix Securities was set up by Mr John Craven, now chief executive of
Morgan Grenfell, the Deutsche Bank-owned merchant bank, and advised on many
of the mergers which reshaped London's securities industry in the mid-1980s.
It was part of Morgan Grenfell until a management buy-out in 1990.
Mr Butt was involved in the development of the insurance strategy of BAT
Industries, the company's parent. BAT acquired Farmers, the Californian
insurance group, and Allied Dunbar, the life insurer, in the 1980s and is
now one of Europe's biggest insurance groups.
Mr Butt says the resistance of existing management has been one of the main
factors holding up insurance takeovers and mergers to date. In addition,
many potential predators are waiting until uncertainties in such areas as
mortgage indemnity, pollution and asbestosis are resolved before they make
approaches.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Letter: Guinness juror argues that fraud trials not too
complex for juries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs EDNA WIJERATNA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As the chairperson of the jury in the recently collapsed second
Guinness trial, I am taking the unusual step of writing to you following the
article by Justinian ('How to avoid trial by ordeal', February 24), when he
refers to the need to reconsider the use of a jury in fraud cases. This has
been argued a number of times of late, on the grounds that juries find such
cases hard to understand and force the trials to become unreasonably long.
In fact, the Guinness jury did not find it unduly difficult to understand
the material, and their chief frustration was the very slow rate of
progress, caused chiefly by the way in which Mr Roger Seelig conducted his
own defence. They were disappointed and angry when the trial ended with
justice neither done nor seen to be done, and many of them wondered whether
the consideration extended to Mr Seelig would have been forthcoming for a
defendant in humbler circumstances. This is not, of course, to imply
anything on the issue of his innocence or guilt.
Members of the legal profession have a way of writing about juries as if it
were universally recognised that they are composed of people vastly inferior
in understanding to their august selves.
This seems to bear no relation to reality, at least as far as Guinness II is
concerned. It deflects attention from the real problems which need to be
tackled in the handling of fraud cases.
It seems particularly necessary to make these points when some are arguing
that the problems of trying fraud cases by jury are such that it would be
better to take them out of the criminal law altogether. Surely the legal
profession will have failed society if a thief ceases to be considered a
thief, or a cheat a cheat, provided he operates with sufficient
sophistication.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Letter: Failure of many quality programmes no surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON GREENLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Tony Gill (Letters, February 21) may have been disappointed by
Christopher Lorenz (Management February 17), but we are disappointed with
Tony Gill.
He has fallen into the trap of taking one theme, in his case systemic
thinking, and presenting it as a universal business panacea. Systemic
thinking is only one element of the total system quality approach. This
requires examination of the company as a whole. We call it the house of
change.
Its three main building blocks are the company environment, organisation and
systems. We deliberately use the word environment, culture is too narrow a
concept.
Supporting these must be a communication system and a management education
process.
Above everything, change requires leadership, and when we say leadership we
do not mean management.
Given the half-hearted approach of both management and consultants to total
quality, it is not surprising that a recent survey suggests that eight out
of ten quality programmes taking place in the UK are failing. Leaders of
British industry must understand the total system quality approach and why
they need to commit to it and then protect it.
When leaders stop leading, followers stop following. That is the real crisis
that business is facing in the UK.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Letter: Two ways to resolving the possibility of GATT
failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN HOWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The accounts you carry of the various contingency plans in the event of
the multilateral trade system breaking down as a result of failure to reach
agreement in the Uruguay Round are getting progressively more depressing;
and now you report (Commodities and Agriculture, February 27) the prospect
of 'hand to hand combat' between Europe and America. Less copiously
reported, although diligently analysed by my colleagues Adrian Hewitt and
Sheila Page, are the severely damaging consequences for developing countries
if world trade is to break up into regional blocs. It is ludicrous that so
much damage to the world economy should be triggered by a failure to reach a
political agreement on agricultural protection in Europe and North America.
There appear to be two main ways of resolving this. The best solution is
clearly a political initiative at the heads of government level. The prime
minister, when chairing the G7 London summit, undertook that leaders would
knock heads together if the negotiations did not reach a prompt, and now
overdue, Uruguay Round settlement. Election or no election, the time has now
come for Mr Major to take action. The timing is no less felicitous for
presidents Bush and Mitterrand, who are also confronting awkward electoral
calendars. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks have now been
going on for 5 1/2 years and action should be taken to agree a comprehensive
settlement, based broadly on the present Dunkel draft, by the end of next
month.
If this proves impossible, the alternative solution (and one barely worthy
of the term the second-best) was hinted at by Lord Trefgarne (Letters,
January 10). Temperate agriculture could be dropped from the Uruguay Round
and a settlement agreed forthwith on everything else. For those who profess
to believe in an open trading system it is nonsense, of course, to leave
agricultural production and trade outside the norms and rules of the GATT.
But if such nonsense enables progress on other fronts it may be acceptable
nonsense. Achievements on textiles, services, manufactures, and in
instilling in scores of once defiantly protectionist developing countries
the firm belief that they can benefit from free trade, are considerable and
must not be put in jeopardy by politically-driven stubbornness of tragic
proportions.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Giant strides for the French Elf: The oil company is running
against the tide of global retrenchment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group, attracted envious stares from its
competitors last month when it became the first big western oil company to
sign production-sharing deals in the former Soviet Union.
The agreements, in Kazakhstan and Russia, are the fruit of nearly three
years of painstaking negotiation with the chaotically changing bureaucracies
involved, by Mr Lok Le Floch-Prigent, the bearded Breton who is Elf's
chairman. They give Elf a share in what some observers believe may be the
equivalent of a new Kuwait - or what could equally be a costly folly.
'Just tell me where in the world the oil business is not risky. Tell me
which nation in the world knows what its energy policy will be 10 years from
now,' ripostes Mr Le Floch-Prigent. If all goes to plan, Russia and
Kazakhstan will provide 20 per cent of Elf's reserves by 2000.
Elf's ambition in the east is the most startling illustration yet of why the
state-controlled company has become such a puzzle to the world oil industry.
At a time when bigger competitors have been retrenching, the formerly
cautious Elf has been doing the opposite.
It has spent a record FFr35.7bn (Pounds 3.6bn) on international acquisitions
since President Francois Mitterrand hand-picked Mr Le Floch-Prigent to shake
up France's largest company, and the world's seventh biggest oil group, in
mid-1989. What has he achieved?
The suspicion is that Elf has just been another victim of the takeover fever
which has prompted some of France's biggest businesses to seek foreign
expansion with little thought and at any cost in recent years, only to
regret it when the economic downturn began to hurt.
Yet nothing could be further from the truth, argues Mr Le Floch-Prigent, as
he reflects on his progress and plans in a sun-filled office high up in
Elf's mirror-clad Parisian tower block. Certainly, Elf has been hit by the
downturn like everyone else in the industry, with a 7.5 per cent fall in net
profits last year. But, unlike British Petroleum, it is not facing a serious
shortage of funds.
Three years ago, Mr Le Floch-Prigent found Elf to be mainly an oil-producing
company with weak refining interests, plus chemicals and pharmaceuticals
businesses - Atochem and Sanofi. Traditionally, the group's job had been to
find oil and gas for France, which explains why it is one of the few oil
groups today able to produce as much as - in fact, a bit more than - it
refines.
Historically, the government has taken an active role in Elf's strategy. For
example, it leant on the company twice, in the early 1980s and towards the
end of the decade, to help prop up parts of the then troubled state
chemicals industry.
Today, Mr Le Floch-Prigent has been given a freer hand in setting and
carrying out objectives than his predecessors. This is an important element
in the changes at Elf, and in line with the gradual withdrawal of French
state influence from trouble-free areas of the public sector. He welcomes
the government's plans to sell 2 per cent of Elf's equity. It currently owns
53.8 per cent.
It is a mark of his new degree of independence that Mr Le Floch-Prigent
successfully resisted government pressure, soon after his arrival, to sell
Texasgulf, a loss-making US mineral chemicals group acquired by a
predecessor in 1981. Instead, he kept the business and wrote down Dollars
600m of Texasgulf's assets.
Mr Le Floch-Prigent's business plan, which he says is not quite complete,
has been to turn the loose French-oriented conglomerate of oil-related
businesses that he inherited into an international integrated oil group.
That means getting a balance between upstream, or production and
exploration, and downstream activities - refining, marketing, chemicals and
pharmaceuticals - as well as broadening international coverage in all
sectors.
The thinking behind this is to use the downstream businesses to produce the
cash needed by the capital-hungry and volatile upstream divisions, he
explains. Last year, upstream and downstream businesses accounted for an
equal share of operating earnings for the first time, a sign that Elf really
is getting its businesses to balance.
Upstream, Elf has over the past three years bought acreage in the North Sea
and west Africa, so lifting production by more than 40 per cent - an
unusually big jump for the industry - to 760,000 barrels per day.
Mr Le Floch-Prigent sees Russia and Kazakhstan as the natural next area for
development because they are in his own backyard. 'Just as a New York oil
company would look at Los Angeles, so we look at the ex-Soviet Union. It's
only three and a half hours on the plane,' he says.
Downstream, he has been more active, if only because this side of Elf's
business used to be undersized, representing a third of operating earnings
three years ago.
There are the acquisitions of Amoco's refinery and filling stations in the
UK - incidentally Elf's first big refinery outside France; nearly all the
Heron petrol station network; a big minority stake in Cepsa, Spain's
second-largest oil refiner; and Minol, the former east German filling
station monopoly. In chemicals, there is the takeover of Pennwalt in the US,
and in pharmaceuticals, the alliance between Sanofi and Sterling Drug, the
medium-sized US drug maker.
Contrary to popular myth, Elf has not financed its ambitions with state
subsidies, nor with excessive debt. Most of the cash has come from Elf's
FFr27bn per year cashflow, while the group has also allowed itself a
moderate increase in debt, from 12 per cent of shareholders' capital three
years ago to 30 per cent now. At that level, its gearing is still medium to
low for the industry, between BP's 69 per cent and Shell's 11 per cent.
Elf has also sought to reduce the cost of acquisitions by paying with shares
 -by, for example, putting part of its stake in Enterprise Oil, the UK
exploration and production company, towards the acquisition of Occidental
Petroleum's North Sea interests. Nor did any cash change hands in the
Sterling Drug alliance, set up as a straight merger - a model that Mr Le
Floch-Prigent aims to use again in future link-ups.
If his three-year mandate is renewed, as seems likely, in June, he reckons
his work at Elf is far from over. He wants to reduce the company's
dependence on oil production in Europe and Africa - 96 per cent of the total
 -by striking new agreements in the Middle East before the Russian fields
come on stream. The chemicals and pharmaceuticals businesses need a big
partner in Japan, he adds.
Elf's stubbornly low share price is a perennial disappointment to Mr Le
Floch-Prigent, and a consequence of the state's ownership, according to some
of his executives. 'I don't criticise the market, but I point out that it is
disappointing that the market values us as if we were just an oil business,
with no chemicals or pharmaceuticals and all the cashflow they produce,' he
complains.
On this basis, he thinks the price/earnings ratio should be more than 12, in
line with the bigger oil companies, rather than its current level of nearly
10 times historic earnings. Elf tried to improve the marketability of its
shares by realising a long-held dream of getting a New York listing last
June, since when Mr Le Floch-Prigent has made frequent trips to New York to
try to persuade analysts that Elf is undervalued.
As for whether being state-owned is an advantage or a handicap, Mr Le
Floch-Prigent refuses to be drawn, as well anyone might whose job lies in
the lap of God, as Mr Mitterrand is jokingly called in the civil service.
All the Elf chairman will says is: 'I am satisfied with my shareholder
because it has allowed me to carry out a good strategy for Elf.'
Being French might have been an advantage in the early stages of the Russian
contracts, when Mikhail Gorbachev was in power, on the ground that the
Soviet Union felt happy dealing with a Socialist government. But state
ownership was irrelevant, says an industry official. 'Exxon is always seen
as the Bush oil group and we are always seen as the Mitterrand oil group in
international negotiations. The oil business is political the world over,'
he says.
Whatever the reason, Elf's transformation over the past three years provides
a rare case study of how a nationally based oil conglomerate is trying to
turn itself into a coherent international group. The risks are enormous, but
then Elf is in a risky business.'

The Australian economy might not be up to much, but its statistics are jolly

sort of magic at a CSO which has had trouble shaking off its dozey image. So
will the gung-ho Australian be impressed by the CSO's latest innovation -
Statfax?
In what could be another cruel blow to London's dwindling army of motorbike
messengers, the CSO is now offerring to fax important statistical press

One of the advertising industry's more boring buzzwords is 'globalisation',
the notion that a product-promoting campaign can be extended across
different cultures and countries. But like so much else in advertising it is
a pretty absurd idea.
Take the Nestle Gold Blend ads. For some four-and-a-half years, commercial
television viewers in the UK have witnessed the development of a 'romantic'
saga between a yuppie couple, whose lives appear full of angst and anomie
except for the brief moments when they share a cup of Nestle Gold Blend
instant coffee.
Now the joyless duo have been transferred to the US, where they are
continuing their assignation; but this time over a cup of Nestles Taster's
Choice. Funny that they prefer a different coffee when in Britain, but never
mind. Nobody is taking much notice, least of all McCann-Erickson, the ad
agency behind the campaign. It is standing behind its own corporate
advertisements which stress 'the branding on the ads is so strong, no-one
ever mistakes them' for other brands of coffee.

The proposed Scottish parliament is growing at a grotesque rate. Under
proposals discussed by the Scottish Constitutional Convention on Friday, the
Edinburgh parliament could have as many as 194 members. Add in the 72 MPs
who the Scots intend to keep at Westminster and the Scottish MP could become
almost as common as the Scottish CA.
Futhermore, under the plan, each MP in Edinburgh will have an office,
secretarial facilities, at least one researcher paid for by the parliament,
a computer hotline to government offices and access to a library staffed
with researchers and replete with 'the latest computer technology.' The MPs
will also have office space in their constituencies, and child care and day
care facilities in the parliament.
One can understand why Scotland's politicians are getting so enthusiastic.
But not surprisingly the question of financing a Scottish parliament is
causing problems.

how it wishes to pursue its European liaisons. AGF has accumulated a 25 per
cent stake in AMB, but the Germans have been refusing to register the bulk

It is the first time that anyone can remember that someone has tried to wind
up the Pru, Britain's biggest investor.
But there it is for all too see in the pages of The London Gazette, no less.
The petition was presented on February 7th by Topbrand Electronic, which
claims to be a creditor. It is understood that the matter has now been
settled but the legal machinery has been set in motion so the man from the
Pru will have to appear in court in Manchester on March 13th, or as soon as
the petition can be heard.
While the petition is clearly ridiculous, it is embarrassing for the Pru. It
means that any one else owed money can pop up in court and support the
winding up petition. It could be a legal field day for the crackpots. Which
member of the Pru's legal department let this lulu slip through?

FT  02 MAR 92 / Observer: Overpowering Burton
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest unseemly boardroom squabble at Burton, the high-street retailer,
over the future of two long-serving non-executive directors, is instructive.
Does a new chairman have a right, like an incoming prime minister, to demand
that his non-executive directors offer their resignations on his arrival in
office?
As the rumour mill has it, the directors in question - Ladislas Rice and
Mark Littman - have been pressed by Sir John Hoskyns, the chairman, to quit.
The two are widely seen as the last hangovers from the Sir Ralph Halpern era
of corporate excess.
Rice and Littman have, however, refused to budge. They do not challenge the
right of a new chairman to recompose his board of directors. On the other
hand it is the directors who appoint the chairman and the shareholders who
appoint the directors.
While one can debate Rice and Littman's record as non-executive directors,
their firm stance on this issue attracts sympathy. Thanks to last year's
rights issue, Burton's finances have been stabilised, but there remain
serious doubts about its longer term retailing strategy. Permitting a
chairman to replace his own board puts far too much power in one person's
hands. For one thing, it would make it far more difficult to sack Sir John
Hoskyns himself.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Arts: Two 'Beauties' - The Cullen Theater, Houston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It must have seemed a splendid idea at the time - and Houston Grand Opera
during David Gockley's 20-year directorship, has consistently traded in
lively ideas about expanding the repertory, as the company track record
shows.
A specially commissioned new 'Beauty and the Beast' opera, Desert of Roses
by Robert Moran, was to be played in alternation with an updating of
Gretry's 1771 Zemire et Azor, which has the same theme. Both the new and the
old version of the fairytale would have English texts, the Zemire (by
Marmontel) translated by John Michael LaChiusa, the Desert of Roses
librettist. Both would be staged by John Dew, the Englishman resident in
Bielefeld. The Zemire production had originally been devised for that city;
the Desert is due to make the journey there later in the year.
A plausible package - but this time, alas, Houston's luck in arranging such
things ran out, for the wrapping proved both flashy and ill-finished, and
the contents, though in themselves by no means valueless, had been
injudiciously selected.
Last November Dew gave Covent Garden audiences that wretchedly empty,
poorly-warmed-over Les Huguenots in modern dress. In similar vein he had
conceived of Gretry's lovely, tender, sturdily fashioned opera-comique fable
(which Londoners remember from the 1981 Camden Festival revival) as an
exercise in pop updating, with the Beast as a rock-singer, Beauty's father a
vacuum-cleaner salesman, and other bits and bobs of added Americana.
The taste level was pitched low - so low, in fact, that Gockley (who
apparently acquired the staging sight unseen) asked for 11th-hour
improvements and amendments. At this point Dew left town, and both shows,
still credited to him, were patched together by assistants.
This Zemire may have amused those spectators who find the whole notion of
opera got up to look like bad television killingly funny - Dew's borrowings
from game shows, celebrity interviews and rock spectaculars were of
unwavering predictability. But it was still a distressing example of
Producer's Patronage - of an audience presumed stupid enough, and a work
presumed trashy enough, to need 'help' of this kind. Apart from praising the
bright-toned Zemire of Diana Amos, and relishing the promise of another
young soprano, Kimla Beasley, as her sister Fatime, one is probably well
advised to pass over the whole sorry thing without further comment.
Desert of Roses had a lot more going for it. Moran, a 54-year-old American
avant-gardist previously best known for his humorous music-theatre
extravagances (such his 1971 Hallelujah for 20 marching bands, 40 church
choirs, organs, carillons, rock and gospel groups, and the entire city of
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania), has come to 'straight' opera via The Juniper Tree
(1985), which he composed in collaboration with Philip Glass, and which HGO
performed in 1986.
He has stripped his 'Beauty' of conceptual posturing, experimentalist
pranks, and indeed of all avant-garderie; the score, written for
chamber-forces plus delicately used synthesisers, is catchy in what one
might call a minimalist-plus vein, with tootling um-cha-um-cha
accompaniments (well handled by the HGO music director John DeMain) layered
upon harmonies high in sugar content.
Moran writes well for voices, and knows how and where to place his numbers;
where he and LaChiusa showed their inexperience was in being seldom able to
get to the point, economically and quickly. Both on the comic family scenes
 -Beauty here has an ugly brother as well as two ugly sisters - and on those
of sentiment I found myself itching to wield an editor's pruning shears.
Because of this, and the sweet-toothed idiom, the whole work seemed blander
than it should or could have. But maybe the production was also to blame: it
was sad that the apt prettiness of the decor (designed by Heinz Balthes) had
not been matched by a similar aptness in the direction of the comedy
characters - gross clowning is clearly a John Dew trademark.
There were two fine young sopranos to note: Jayne West (Beauty) dewy-fresh
and appealing, Stella Zambalis (Woman, a narrator-chorus figure) strikingly
rich-toned. About this 'Beauty' at least, and for all its imperfections,
Houston need feel no embarrassment.

Esmonde and Larbey, a practised writing team, are good at judging the right
point between 'quirky' and 'ludicrously contrived' and they may have done it
again. Karl Howman plays the working class rough diamond, Mulberry, who is

Horizon considers how money should be spent on science: on research projects
with known practical applications or on establishing the origins of the

World In Action (8.30 ITV) investigates the 'dirty tricks' departments of
the three main political parties. The C4 documentary series Cutting Edge
returns for another series with a programme about missing people, in

present for his son and has not been seen by his family since. In Panorama
Jane Corbin reports on the mining industry seven years after the strike.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Another royal birthday has passed without Margaret Price receiving the
honour that is her due. It may be that the criteria by which these decisions
are made cannot be divulged, but it is starting to look as though a career
largely furthered and celebrated across Europe is no substitute for a more
insular popularity at home.
On Friday the singer was in London for a recital at the Queen Elizabeth
Hall. The programme was all German song, Schumann in the first half, Brahms
in the second, and it only served to emphasize what a European artist Miss
Price has become, for there are not many native German-speakers who sing
Lieder as eloquently at the moment; and there have been precious few British
singers to equal her in this field at any time.
In Schumann's Kerner Lieder, Op. 35, never much loved by audiences for their
heavyweight Teutonic romanticism, she came up against memories of past
London interpreters such as Hermann Prey and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (a
particular champion of the set) and radiated a beauty over the music that
the others could not match. The songs were taken slowly and, as is her
inclination, in too deliberate a manner. But the audience was held.
Above all, one felt for the first time that the songs made sense as a cycle.
The feeling of a sun-lit warmth of emotion, at first starting to melt the
chill ending of 'Frage' and then flooding out through 'Stille Tranen", was
gloriously handled, both by the soprano and her accompanist, Graham Johnson.
The music's heartbeat had been caught and the performance made a deeply
moving descent down to the numbed desperation of the ending.
In her Brahms - a selection of eight Volkslieder and the Zigeunerlieder, Op.
103 - lighter moods predominated. A delicious sentimentality for 'Da unten
im Tale"; no false attempts at funny voices for the ever-popular
'Vergebliches Standchen'. And, always, the purity of the voice and unforced
utterance of the German poetry were there to give pleasure. For singing of
this quality no further recognition is perhaps necessary.
At the other end of the scale, just starting out on a career which one
trusts will live up to its initial promise, is the young soprano Alison
Buchanan. Still in her early 20s, she appeared on Thursday in the 'Young
Artists' lunchtime recital series at Covent Garden, coincidentally
accompanied by a young pianist, Eugene Asti, who has himself been working
with Margaret Price.
It was an enjoyable occasion, not maybe one to burn itself upon the memory,
but leaving a feeling of considerable optimism for the future. This is based
largely on the beauty and ease of Miss Buchanan's voice. Nothing in a quite
adventurous programme seemed to trouble her vocally at all; the tone is
attractively warm, beautifully lambent when she sings quietly, a voice born
of nature, not of artifice.
She sang her Debussy and Wolf songs with due care for style and language,
though not yet quite enough personality (too much earnestness, a smile or
two would help there). Once into English-language songs by Walton, Copland
and Bolcom, the face lit up and so did the words. Her Cole Porter encore
about the little oyster was sheer delight: a delicious lunchtime find]

FT  02 MAR 92 / Arts: Shakespeare in Vienna - Burgtheater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISASTER offstage by superstition accompanies openings of Macbeth and the
Viennese kept the tradition handsomely alive last week. Just after his
premier of the play, radical German director Claus Peymann was reappointed
intendant of the grand, stuffy velvet-and-gold Burgtheater. On Monday four
of its ensemble resigned in protest; the Austrian press compared Peymann to
the three witches and accused him of "smearing Austria with the coolness of
a Prussian hussar," the row became a national sensation, Austrian Chancellor
Vranitzky was forced to comment, but the show played on - to packed houses.
Where else but Vienna, whose stormy relationship with its hallowed
institutions, the Burgtheater and the Opera, express at once an intensity of
belief in culture and a conservatism unmatched in Europe? The Viennese love
to hate the unconventional productions Peymann brings to the Burgtheater. I
caught the two Shakespeares in the repertory: the new Macbeth and Peter
Zadek's Merchant of Venice, a hit which, since I first saw it, has acquired
the confident gloss of a contemporary classic.
Peymann's long-delayed and overlong production (4 1/2 hours) is the weaker,
but it is full of the fun which makes a Burgtheater visit so rewarding.
There is a fat, camp witch (Urs Hefti), who dances a melancholic, solo
waltz, lifts his skirts, inflates himself with balloon breasts drooping to
the knees, and balances on the rim of a giant cauldron; a sexy colleague
stirs it with a six-foot spoon, while smouldering up to Macbeth.
Forget the sustained hellishness of a traditional Macbeth: every image here
is developed, parodied, reversed. Starting with bare boards, no one uses the
stage less conventionally than Peymann. Act II takes place in a shaft of
light just three feet wide. Bloodstained, frightened, determined, the
Macbeths slither and stumble up and down a central staircase. It rises to a
loft where a chandelier glows, then fades as dawn breaks, panic sets in,
guests tumble over the banisters in shock. At its foot, a trap door is the
castle gate; the drunken porter (Gerhard Ernst) sits on it, tells Viennese
jokes, is bounced into the air at each insistent knock from beneath: comedy
underlies tragedy above.
This is a Macbeth whose clever effects hold the house but have yet to cohere
into a powerfully realised vision: I understood the play no better at the
end than at the start. Gert Voss, a Shakespearian actor whose refusal to be
awed by set speeches makes for a wonderfully relaxed Shylock, is here a
confused, too casual Macbeth, a thinker rather than a soldier but a
befuddled one.
His lady (Kirsten Dene) also lacks vigour. They share an eerie repertoire of
laughs - conspiratorial giggles, embarrassed bellows, mocking, Don Giovanni
before the statue guffaws - but never go beyond unease or delusion. Even
when Macbeth sees himself in the glass of the last kingly ghost, where
fantasy should meet reality, his shriek might sound from a grotesque chamber
of horrors as well as from isolation or guilt. "Best not know myself," says
Voss, not with the regret of "This is not Lear" or "That's he that was
Othello," but as if entertainment, not transformation or self-knowledge,
were the name of this game.
By contrast, The Merchant of Venice has the best of Burgtheater showmanship
allied to a genuinely original re-reading. This production, set on Wall
Street, is now compelling as a 1980s period piece, as well as a Shakespeare
interpretation. It changed Venetians into Brylcreemed power-dressed yuppies,
who slide in and out of a huge chrome lift onto the dealing floor, do
work-outs in lunch breaks, and make hard, macho jokes which may happen to be
about Jews, or about bonds in pound of flesh.
Voss's aryan Shylock is so integrated that plummy Portia (Eva Mattes)
demands of the wrong men: "Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?"
His daughter, Jessica, buys her way into her gentile husband's office
knees-up by slinging dollars among the debris of party hats and empty
glasses. She is instantly welcomed. And when Shylock loses his case, he
struts manfully across the office, like the dealer who flopped on Black
Monday: a blip in his career, but not the end.
In shifting the moral core of the play from mercy and tolerance to survival
and brazen guts, Zadek both questions the traditional role of Jew as victim
and offers social comment. Like a recent Peymann production which satirised
Vienna through a scaled-down but lovingly detailed model of the Burgtheater
itself, the green copper roof peeping out over a stagey Volksgarten, Zadek's
classic vision is a critique of a loveless, money-mad world whose energy is
nevertheless attractive. It is a love-hate response. This production has
gathered pace since its opening and now zips along breathlessly, its
slapstick humour - dealers caught in lifts, runners left out of lifts -
bizarre as a video on fast forward, its charm and speed already nostalgic as
well as contemporary.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Arts: Building for history - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Sir Charles Barry, the architect of the Palace of Westminster, died in
1860, the Art Journal claimed that the new Palace had 'given an impetus to
the three sister arts of painting, sculpture and architecture they in all
probability would have never otherwise received.' What is the likelihood of
the same words being written today about the important new parliamentary
building that was announced last week?
The new building, which is to provide offices for MPs, occupies what must be
regarded as one of the most sensitive sites in the capital, on the Thames at
the corner of Bridge Street and the Victoria Embankment. It will stand next
door to Big Ben and will be an important feature in the townscape of
Parliament Square, Westminster and the river.
The site has long been a controversial one. An earlier competition for a
parliamentary extension here was won by architects Spence and Webster and
they produced a large minimalist glazed box which did not win enough friends
in parliament for it ever to be built. More recently a planning study was
carried out by Casson Conder and Partners which proposed a parliamentary
'campus'. This plan, which is now being followed, established a secure
perimeter for parliamentary buildings stretching from Bridge Street to
Richmond Terrace and from the Victoria Embankment to Parliament Street,
necessitating the closure of Canon Row. The first phase of this work was
recently completed and includes the refurbishment and adaptation of several
listed buildings. The latest proposal is for an entirely new building over
the top of the Underground incorporating a new Westminster station that will
be a stop on the proposed extension of the Jubilee Line.
The architects for the new Parliamentary building, Michael Hopkins and
Partners, were appointed by the Department of the Environment and they
completed their sketch proposals in October last year. Since then a great
deal of work has depended on the planned development with London Underground
of the new Westminster Station beneath the building. Michael Hopkins will
also be the architect of this new station.
Hopkins has almost become the architect of the Establishment. Following his
successful stand at Lord's cricket ground in St Marylebone, he has moved on
to be the architect for the new Glyndebourne opera house; the new offices
for the Inland Revenue in Nottingham (won in competition last week); and the
superb, recently completed conversion of the former Financial Times building
at Bracken House for the Obayashi company in the City. He is also the house
architect for the refurbishment of the Victoria and Albert museum.
It is no easy task to design a major public building to stand between Norman
Shaw's Scotland Yard and Barry and Pugin's Palace of Westminster; and
opposite Ralph Knott's County Hall. It is also a challenge, today, to design
something that conveys to the world that it is an important public building
occupied by people who may contribute to the history of the nation.
Architects and their clients come up against difficult questions about the
meaning of architecture, and the language that architecture can or should
use to convey values beyond the merely functional.
Sir Charles Barry had what he called his 'great idea' to make his new Palace
of Westminster a monumental history of England. He was able to achieve this
only with the help of the prodigal imagination and decorative and
antiquarian skill of Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-1852). The final
result of Barry and Pugin's achievement is one of the most remarkable public
buildings in the world and must be seen as the touchstone for any new
building that grows alongside it.
Hopkins has understood clearly the logic of Barry's axial plans and designed
his new offices around a courtyard. He has also looked closely at the
skyline of Westminster and dealt with the mechanical problems of air intake
and extract rather in the way that Barry did, by utilising finials and
ornamental details as part of the ventilation system. Whitehall is a street
of courtyards, almost all of which are invisible to the public. It is
presumably only essential security, plus privileged parking places, that
prevents the whole of the Government area being an open series of beautiful
public quadrangles.
The Secretary of State for the Environment described the site of the new
building as 'one of the most sensitive sites in the urban world' and the
architects' design as 'a high class solution'. I think it will be a good
office building. It will be built of very good materials, using a dark
pinkish sandstone (from Scotland) for its load bearing walls and bronze for
its roof. The palate is dark, closer to Norman Shaw's Scotland Yard than to
the Palace of Westminster. This I am sure is right, as is the decision to
treat the form and silhouette of the new building as a separate 'palazzo'
along the Thames. The elevational treatment, the grid relieved by vertical
strips of projecting bay windows a la Bracken House, is unremarkable. The
curved corner turrets seem to have been inspired by Sir Albert Richardson's
treatment of big city blocks. The roof, with all its metal catwalks, is
unduly spiky and complex.
For the one Pounds 120m it is expected to cost, this should be a very fine
modern office building. But as a very major, new public landmark I question
whether it is imaginative enough for its important site. It is a cautious
marriage of elements from the its more powerful neighbours - an arranged
marriage of convenience rather than one sparked into life by roaring
romance. Barry did put the history of England into his designs, and was not
afraid of the power of art to convey his ideas. Perhaps Hopkins needs a
Pugin to add some fire to his cool rationalism?

House Construction and Jardine Matheson, has won a Pounds 48m (HKDollars
655m) contract to build a multi-storey tower extension (pictured left) to
The Peninsula Hotel, located in the heart of Tsim Sha Tsui.
Scheduled for completion within two years, the project consists of a
32-storey 116 metre tower above a five level 21 metre deep basement. It will
be built using the time-saving 'top-down' method. Consisting of a concrete
frame clad with a panelised curtain wall system, the new tower will be
joined at its lower floors to the existing building. The contract also
includes all the services and internal finishes.
Gammon Construction has undertaken a series of projects at The Peninsula
Hotel over the past few years. They include some additions and alterations
completed last year as well as foundation work for the new extension.
Although access to the site will be difficult, the hotel will remain open
throughout the construction period.

JALAL COSTAIN WLL has been awarded a contract worth Pounds 6.4m for civil
works for two floating dry docks in Hidd, Bahrain, by the Arab Shipbuilding
&amp; Repair Yard (ASRY).
Four reinforced concrete mooring dolphins, each weighing about 2,500 tonnes,
will be precast nine kilometres away from the site on a barge moored at a
yard in North Sitra. When the dolphins are half finished, the barge will be
transferred to ASRY, where the 1,200 tonne structures will be lifted off the
barge, floated in the water and completed. They will then be sunk in
position and the mooring "furniture' added to accommodate the floating
docks.
At the same time, 135 precast concrete blocks, each weighing 100 tonnes,
will be cast at Sitra, transported by barge to the site and laid on
diver-prepared foundations to create a jetty pier, thus providing access to
the floating docks.
The project also includes landfill of 210,000 cu metres and rock armour
slope protection, on which dock buildings and facilities will be con
structed.
Jalal Costain WLL is 49 per cent owned by Costain Engineering &amp;

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Iain Robertson is moving from County NatWest, where he is deputy chief
executive and group finance director, to Royal Bank of Scotland, where he
will be managing director of the corporate and institutional banking
division, succeeding John Barclay who recently became deputy chief
executive.
This means that the Royal Bank will now have two former chief executives of
the Scottish Development Agency in its top ranks. George Mathewson, who has
been Royal Bank's group chief executive since January, left the SDA for the
Royal in 1987 and was succeeded by Robertson, his close associate at the
agency. Robertson left the SDA in 1990 shortly before the government turned
it into Scottish Enterprise and moved to London to join County NatWest as
group finance director. Now Mathewson has Robertson under his wing again.
Robertson will stay in London.
Robertson, a tall, terse man, originally trained as a chartered accountant
with Peat Marwick but spent much of his career in the civil service before
running the SDA's Locate in Scotland division. He has been in his present
post at County NatWest since last July.
AEGIS Group has appointed Thierry Vial Collet, 46, an executive director.
Vial Collet joined Aegis last October, taking up the post of chief executive
of Carat, Aegis's powerful European-wide media buying subsidiary.
A marketing specialist, he was chief executive of Henkel France immediately
before joining Carat.
*****
Derek Hawkins, formerly finance director of Davy Corporation, is appointed
director of corporate finance at WPP Group. Chris Coles, formerly director
of group treasury, is returning to SG WARBURG.

INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM on the retirement of Michael Harvey.

HIGGS AND HILL NORTHERN has been awarded two contracts worth Pounds 4.8m for
the extensive refurbishment of local authority housing developments in
Rotherham and Bradford.
In Bradford, the Directorate of Housing and Environmental Protection, City
of Bradford Metropolitan Council, has awarded the company a Pounds 3.3m
contract to refurbish and modernise a large housing development at Sticker
Lane.
The project involves the complete upgrading of a development of both three
and five-storey blocks of flats. A number of the blocks will be reduced in
height from five to three storeys.
Higgs and Hill Northern has also been awarded a Pounds 1.5m contract by the
Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council to undertake the external
refrbishment of another large housing estate in Rotherham.
The Canklow Housing Estate comprises around 250 dwellings and the work
involves site clearance, the construction of new boundary walls, fencing and
landscaping. Work is due for completion in mid 1993.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Construction Contracts: Kwiksave's expansion on Merseyside
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Warwick Group Construction, the main contractor, has appointed Burton-based
CONDER STRUCTURES, the superstructures division of Conder Group, to design
and erect the superstructure for several new Kwiksave stores, including the
steel frame, cladding and roof purlins.
Features on some of the buildings included lightweight simulated roof tiles
and a mansard arch - a hallmark of a Kwiksave store.
The four new Merseyside stores are at Litherland, New Ferry, Wallasey and
Bromborough and are all currently at varying stages of construction.
In Newport, south Wales, Conder Structures' Bridgend office has also been
responsible for the design, fabrication and erection of structural steel and
cladding of Kwiksave's 11,542 sq metre multispan distribution warehouse.
Kwiksave's original warehouse had been destroyed by fire and the company
required a rapid response to avoid the obvious logistical problems that
might have occurred. Total value to Conder Structures of all five contracts
is about Pounds 1m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MJ GLEESON GROUP's southern construction division has won a Pounds 9.14m
contract for a mixed development of social housing, associated facilities
and infrastructure on 12 acres of former railway sidings at Davidson Road,
Croydon.
For a six-strong consortium led by South London Family Housing Association,
the scheme will take 21 months to complete.
Gleeson will design and build 216 two,three and four-bedroom houses - five
of which will have wheelchair units - together with seven one and two-person
flats. Some 70 per cent of these will provide rented accommmodation, with
the remainder offered for shared ownership.
As part of the development, Gleeson will also design and build two hostels
and a shop. Each hostel will have six independent units of bedroom and
kitchen, as well as communual dining, lounge and play rooms. Additionally,
to alleviate flooding that occurs regularly in the area, Gleeson will
pipejack a 1.7 metre diameter flood relief sewer underneath the nearby
railway line.
The other members of the consortium are Croydon Churches, Tower, Croydon
Peoples and Crystal Palace Housing Associations, and London &amp; Quadrant
Housing Trust.

London Wall Members Agency, one of the biggest members' agents at the
Lloyd's of London insurance market, broke the mould this week by appointing
an accountant, John Moir, to be its new managing director. He will also join
the board of London Wall Holdings.
In the past, members' agents, which handle the affairs of Names have tended
to appoint underwriters to this type of position. Robin Warrender, the
chairman, says he wanted someone with administrative and managerial skills.
Moir, now 55, fits the bill. In the mid-1980s he was recruited from Arthur
Andersen by former chief executive Ian Hay Davison to head the finance and
market services department at Lloyd's. Subsequently he has worked with other
agencies at Lloyd's.
Michael Doughty is also appointed to the board of London Wall Members
Agency.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Economics: Hopeful eyes seek signs of 'robins on the lawn'
amid US indicators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUSY week for economic indicators in the US will give economists and
financial markets a chance to judge whether US Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady's new found optimism about recovery is justified or not.
He says he has spied 'robins on the lawn'. The consensus of analysts'
forecasts compiled by MMS International, the business information group,
suggests he may be right.
Today's report from the National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM)
is expected to point to a slightly more upbeat assessment of the outlook
among manufacturers.
Friday's labour market data for February should show no further increase in
unemployment from January's 7.1 per cent.
A quiet week for UK economic news will be overshadowed by more frenetic
political activity ahead of the Budget on March 10.
Several important inflation indicators will be published on the European
continent.
With Germany's preliminary cost of living index for February expected to
show annual inflation at more than 4 per cent, the Bundesbank will not want
to relax its high interest rate policy for the time being.
Events and statistics, with median market forecasts from MMS in brackets,
include:
Today: US: February NAPM index (48 per cent), January personal income
(flat), personal consumption expenditure (up 0.4 per cent), construction
spending (up 0.4 per cent), fourth quarter merchandise trade balance. UK,
January final money supply. Japan, February foreign exchange reserves.
Canada, December building permits (down 1 per cent), leading indicator (up
0.2 per cent).
Tomorrow: US: Presidential primaries in Colorado, Idaho, Minnesota and
Maryland, January leading indicators (up 0.6 per cent), January new home
sales (up 3.7 per cent). UK: February official reserves (down Dollars 120m).
Japan, January unemployment rate. Australia, January seasonally adjusted
current account (ADollars 980m deficit).
Wednesday: US: January factory goods orders (up 0.9 per cent), goods
shipments. Australia, January building approvals (up 2.5 per cent). Canada:
February help wanted index, foreign reserves.
Thursday: Germany: Bundesbank council meeting, third round of public sector
wage talks begins, February German unemployment, vacancies, short time
working, January employment. US: Treasury secretary Nicholas Brady testifies
to House foreign relations committee on administration's international
agenda; money supply figures for week to Feb 24, weekly initial claims. UK:
February new car sales, January cyclical indicators.
Friday: Japan: February Tankan report. US: February unemployment rate (7.1
per cent), manufacturing payrolls (down 16,500), non-farm payrolls (up
24,000), hourly earnings, average week worked, January consumer credit
(flat). UK: January housing starts, fourth quarter balance of payments.
Canada: February unemployment (10.4 per cent), employment growth (flat).
During the week: Germany: January industrial production (up 1.5 per cent),
manufacturing output (up 1.1 per cent), manufacturing orders (up 0.5 per
cent), trade balance (DM3.5bn surplus), current account (DM1.4bn deficit),
February preliminary cost of living (up 0.4 per cent on month, 4.1 per cent
on year). Switzerland: fourth quarter GDP (up 0.3 per cent annualised on
Q3), February consumer prices (up 0.4 per cent on month, 4.3 per cent on
year). Italy: February consumer prices (up 0.8 per cent on month, 6.1 per
cent on year, January balance of payments, reserves. France: January M3 (up
0.3 per cent on month).

FT  02 MAR 92 / The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RESULTS DUE
At BICC, the cables and construction group, the impact of recessions in
North America, Australia and the UK was previously softened by the
resilience of the continental cables market. Last year that stronghold began
to weaken and pre-tax profits are expected to have fallen to about Pounds
100m (from Pounds 183m). The range of estimates ahead of Wednesday's
announcement is quite wide because of uncertainty about exceptional charges
for property write-downs and reorganisation.
General Accident, the Perth-based general and life insurer, reports its 1991
results tomorrow. Like Commercial Union and Royal Insurance, GA is expected
to post losses. However, the company's exposure to mortgage indemnity
losses, which contributed heavily to Royal's disastrous performance this
week, is limited. Even so, underlying trading performance is weak and losses
for 1991 are expected to be in the region of Pounds 160m, against Pounds
121m last year.
GKN, the motor components and industrial services group, is expected to show
on Wednesday pre-tax profits virtually halved from Pounds 172m in 1990 to
between Pounds 85m and Pounds 90m last year.
With most of its continental European markets turning down alongside the UK
and US, the few cushioning factors have included its involvement in new
models. GKN is credited with good cash conservation and the dividend is
thought to be safe, if uncovered.
Cadbury Schweppes' premium rating among food-processing shares will be put
to the test when it reports full-year results on Wednesday. Though last
year's overall growth in UK confectionery and soft drinks volumes was
unexciting, the company is thought to have benefitted from a last-minute,
pre-Christmas buying surge and from steady price increases on the drinks
side. Forecasts range from Pounds 310m to Pounds 316m pre-tax, up from
Pounds 279.6m in 1990.
Ladbroke, the leisure group, is expected to report on Thursday a one-third
fall in pre-tax profits to about Pounds 210m (Pounds 305m). Three of its
four divisions will be worse off. Trading profits from hotels, bearing
first-quarter Gulf War damage, will be about Pounds 128m (Pounds 149m);
those from betting, reflecting poorer punters, will be about Pounds 82m
(Pounds 91.7m); and property could drop to a loss of Pounds 17m after
interest (Pounds 45.2m profit). Only Texas, the DIY chain, will be ahead
from Pounds 39.7m.
Abbey National, the retail banking group, is expected to announce tomorrow
pre-tax profits for 1991 between Pounds 610m and Pounds 630m, up from Pounds
582m a year ago. This would make it the second most profitable bank in the
UK, a whisker behind Lloyds (Pounds 645m) but comfortably ahead of Barclays
(Pounds 533m).
Provisions against loan losses will be sharply up from last year's Pounds
55m.
Rolls-Royce, the aero engine manufacturer, is expected to report a sharp
fall in profits when it publishes its 1991 figures on Thursday.
The range of market forecasts is between Pounds 60m-Pounds 80m, down from
last year's figure of Pounds 176m, with the slowdown in delivery of new
engines and spares and redundancy costs blamed by analysts for the
reduction.
Analysts believe the company will maintain an uncovered final dividend of
about 4.7p, making a year's total of 7.25p.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Management: Equality, not pornography - Women at Work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLEY ABDELA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The auto industry has always been dominated by men, but at the Audi factory
at Ingolstadt, near Munich, women are beginning to make their mark. For the
last decade they have become an increasingly common sight on the production
line. They are now also to be spotted in the ranks of management.
The factory is loaded with women-welcome signals. Instead of the pornography
that graces the walls of most factories, there are posters showing women and
men working on cars wearing identical company overalls.
Audi started hiring young women as apprentice tool makers and mechanics in
1978. As 80 per cent of the company's jobs are technical, the initiative was
seen as essential if the company was to cease to be a male-stronghold.
In some respects Germany has a more traditional view of male-female role
differences than Britain, but in the last few years both the government and
big companies have been trying to make it easier for women to combine
careers and family. With the birth rate falling sharply, women are
increasingly seen as important to companies like Audi.
At the outset, Audi set itself the goal of increasing the proportion of
female apprentices to 25 per cent. Over the last 14 years, 700 women aged 15
to 20 have taken places on these training schemes, many of whom have gone on
to do advanced training.
It has not been easy: the proportion of female apprentices has still not
reached the target, although it has risen from around 5 per cent to nearly
20 per cent.
One of the most difficult problems has been to persuade the women themselves
to do technical jobs - Audi found the majority were much keener to go into
sales-related jobs.
In an attempt to change attitudes, the company is running advertisments in
German newspapers pitched specifically at female recruits. It sends members
of staff to give talks in schools to parents and students explaining the
potential for young women coming into their factory, to overcome traditional
views of the automotive industry as 'masculine'.
Audi has learned a lot over the last decade about how best to integrate
women into the company. Ten years ago the women were put in separate teams
from the male apprentices but this did not work well. Now the teams are
mixed, with at least two girls on a team. Women apprentices are encouraged
to attend seminars where they can swap experiences.
More recently, Audi has shifted its emphasis to trying to get women
managers. This is part of a general move in German management, related to a
shift away from Prussian-style hierarchies, to increase the ratio of women
to men.
'Where does it say that men make the best managers? It is our policy to
encourage more women to join the next generation of engineering and business
managers . . . ' an Audi recruitment advertisement promises.
Realising no equal opportunities programmes will work without endorsement
from the top, the company has given a board director overall responsibility
for women's development.
Audi offers its staff 50 different types of part-time work. Mothers can take
career breaks for up to seven years with a guaranteed job when they return.
They can retrain with Audi during their maternity leave.
As a company spokesman says: 'We have recognised the problem and are doing
something about it in a positive way. What we don't want or need is quotas
issued by the government.'

FT  02 MAR 92 / Management: Maximum muddle over minimum pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A lot of UK companies are worried about the Labour Party's planned minimum
wage, but few have investigated how to mitigate its effect.
The Labour Party is committed to a minimum hourly rate of 50 per cent of
male median earnings - Pounds 3.40 per hour in 1992 terms. Such a minimum
could effect 3m employees, or 15 per cent of the workforce, according to a
recent study by the Institute of Personnel Management.
The policy has sparked particularly loud protests from retailers, caterers
and textile companies, and the Confederation of British Industry has called
the minimum wage a recipe for unemployment.
John Wilson, director of the British Catering Industry Association, says:
'If the Labour Party interprets the policy as a national minimum hourly
rate, that could add about 30 per cent to the industry's pay bill.'
However some protests have been scaled down after clarification of Labour's
plans. Labour says that the Pounds 3.40 applies to hourly earnings -
including extras  - and not just the basic rate. It does, however, exclude
overtime.
The IPM study shows fewer than 50 per cent of employers were well informed
on the subject. Some employers thought the minimum wage would not affect
them when it actually would.
Colin Purvis, head of the textile industry's association, is not worried
about the effect on larger employers. He believes that only the sweat shops
will be affected, although argues that they will be difficult to police.
Mary Clarkson, employment researcher at the Institute of Directors, says
employers are not planning ahead and would only begin to do so in the first
days of a Labour government. Not all employers are opposed to the minimum
wage.
Roger Faulkner, personnel director at Walsgrave Hospital, Coventry, said he
was already looking at low pay but stressed that a minimum wage would have
to be linked to productivity. Health is one sector where half the
respondents to the IPM study said they supported the minimum wage.
David Cowden, managing director of Securicor Guarding Ltd, which employs
3,000 guards, said: 'If the Labour Party does come in and impose these kinds
of rates on the industry, it could be quite good for us. It would attack the
cowboys who pay low rates.'

FT  02 MAR 92 / Welsh roads to get Pounds 200m boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON, Welsh Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT Pounds 200m is to be spent on roads in Wales next year, Sir Wyn
Roberts, minister of state at the Welsh Office, has announced in a Commons
written answer. He said 'more than Pounds 1.5bn has been spent on motorway
and trunk-road improvements in Wales since 1979'.
There are now 20 schemes in the short-term programme, with a start expected
before April 1995. These include a by-pass for Bethesda on the A5 in north
Wales, a relief road for Holyhead, also on the A5, and a bypass for Whitland
on the A40 in west Wales.
The plans are likely to be criticised by councils in south Wales because
work on widening the A465 Heads of the Valleys road will not begin before
1998 at the earliest. This road is a vital link to the Midlands for many
industrial communities in south Wales.
Priority is being given to further improvements to the M4, completion of the
A55 expressway in north Wales and bypasses on the A470 and A483, the main
links between north and south Wales.

FT  02 MAR 92 / India is dealt a make-or-break budget: But it is uncertain
if the programme can be carried through
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS OPPOSITION in India continues to grow against IMF-style policies, it
seems increasingly uncertain whether the Congress party government of Prime
Minister PV Narasimha Rao will have the stomach to carry through the
programme on which it embarked last year - to open up the economy and
strengthen market mechanisms.
But the budget presented by Dr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, along with
the letters to the World Bank he was forced to disclose to parliament last
week, make clear that India remains on track to implement the most radical
changes in economic policy since it became independent in 1949.
The measures announced in the budget went wider and deeper than most people
had expected. Their boldness will also provide a boost to Dr Singh, who last
week emerged battered from the drubbing he received in parliament.
He was on his feet in parliament on Saturday wittily chiding opponents who
hoped to force his resignation. He told them he had proposed tax concessions
for the self-employed, because if the Opposition had their way, he would
soon find himself in that category. Notwithstanding this bravado, he has by
no means repulsed all attacks from inside the Congress Party and from the
left and Hindu militant BJP party outside.
The budget shows that, in its tactical handling of structural reform, the
government has chosen to move at different speeds on different fronts. It
surprised even the banking community by opting for a partial floating of the
rupee, a move popular in India as partly dismantling much disliked foreign
exchange controls, and well received abroad.
The government is cautious about reducing India's customs tariffs (among the
highest protective tariffs in the world) because it is worried by the loss
of budget revenue and faces strong opposition from industry. The budget was
most hesitant about tackling problems of overmanning in the public sector,
of allowing private companies to retrench their labour forces or close, and
of privatisation. It is here that the government fears the biggest backlash
could occur from the left and the unions.
Over the handling of macroeconomic policy, it is clear that the government
has taken a risk. Dr Singh hopes to bring down inflation from its current 12
per cent to 6 per cent by the end of 1992-93. But he also hopes to lift
industrial growth out of recession to achieve a 5 per cent rise in output
next year. The danger is that higher growth could splutter out in worsening
inflation and balance of payments difficulties.
In opening up the economy both domestically and to foreign competition, the
budget makes several strides. The main step is the announcement of partial
convertibility, which will link the value of the rupee to a market rate.
Under the system to come into force this week, foreign currency holders will
be able to change 40 per cent of their foreign exchange at the official rate
and 60 per cent at an open market rate. The government expects the market
rate will carry a premium of about 15 per cent. Banks will in practice cash
travellers' cheques or remittances at a weighted rate reflecting this ratio.
The system will give Indians and foreigners greater freedom in handling
their foreign exchange business in India. Indians will be allowed for the
first time to keep 15 per cent of dollar earnings in dollar accounts. Apart
from a restricted list of imports, including consumer goods and alcohol,
they will be free to import what they want at market prices. Only oil,
petroleum products and life-saving drugs can be purchased at the official
rate.
The effect of the partial floating will be to encourage exports through a 9
per cent depreciation, while acting as a deterrent to imports. The partially
floating rate will replace the eximscrip, an instrument introduced last year
to limit the volume of imports to the availability of foreign exchange.
Officials said yesterday that freedom of capital movement, which would allow
Indians to purchase fixed assets abroad, was 'not even on the horizon'.
Two other areas opened up to foreigners are direct portfolio investment into
India and foreign investment in the production, refining and marketing of
oil and natural gas. On the first, the finance minister was more cautious,
saying reputable pension funds would be allowed, provided there was no
threat of them getting management control.
On the second, foreign investment is being sought in an area of production
and refining where expenditures are heavy and India lacks the funds.
In line with the emphasis on opening up and encouraging market forces, Dr
Singh announced several moves to strengthen the capital markets.
Indian companies will no longer have to seek government permission to float
an equity issue on the domestic markets or to get government approval for
its pricing. The office of controller of capital issues has been abolished
so that companies can determine when and at what price they approach the
market.
In a separate boost to the market, Dr Singh said that financial assets would
be exempt from wealth tax, a move designed to shift savings from houses and
jewellery to the corporate sector.
Indian companies will also be formally allowed to float issues abroad, have
more freedom to invest abroad, and to enter into ties with foreign groups.
On the reduction of tariff duties, Dr Singh excused his caution by his
difficulties in offsetting lost customs duties through other taxation and by
the risks of a depressed world industry dumping in the Indian market.
He lowered the maximum tariff rate from 150 to 110 per cent. He also reduced
tariff duties on capital goods imports from 80 to 60 per cent with sharper
cuts for electronics, oil and coal mining. But the tariff cuts are partly
offset by the protective effect of the depreciation of the currency.
The net effect of the cuts was to reduce revenue from customs by Rs20bn (or
about 10 per cent of the level of last year). But he reaffirmed his pledge
that duties would come down to internationally comparable levels in three to
four years. He made the same promise to the IMF.
In term's of India's own Byzantine tax structure, Dr Singh made a start at
simplification. He announced a three-band structure with rates fixed at 20,
30 and 40 per cent. He accompanied this simplification by abolishing several
exemptions.
All these structural changes helped mask the weakness of the budget: that it
combines probably irreconcilable goals of bringing down inflation while
accelerating economic growth.
Dr Singh embarked on his budget exercise with an economy growing more slowly
than he had anticipated last July and with inflation stubbornly higher. Real
gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the financial year ending is likely
to be about 2 per cent and inflation nearly 12 per cent. The response of the
budget to this situation has been to provide a stimulus to the economy while
seeking to curb inflation.
The stimulus to the economy will come from a 1 per cent cut in interest
rates announced yesterday by the minister and from tax cuts.
Against this, the deflationary pressure from the budget will come from the
continuing fall in the fiscal deficit. The deficit is scheduled to fall from
8.4 per cent of GDP in 1990-91 to 6.5 per cent in the past financial year
and 5 per cent in the coming financial year.
Most of the reduction in the deficit will come from cuts in spending,
particularly capital spending and subsidies.
If the government is able to achieve its goals of higher growth and lower
inflation, it will have turned around the economy with minimal pain. But if
inflation continues to remain high, the government is in trouble.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Hand over bomb suspects, Russia urges Libyans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev yesterday urged Libya to hand over
to the United Nations secretary-general two Libyans accused of bombing a Pan
Am jet over Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988 with the loss of 270 lives.
Mr Kozyrev made his comments to his Libyan counterpart, Mr Ibrahim Mohammed
Beshari, in Cairo at a private meeting in the Russian embassy.
'I suggested to my Libyan friend that Libya should go along with the
Security Council resolutions because this is the best way out in solving
this problem,' Mr Kozyrev told reporters after a meeting with Egypt's
President Hosni Mubarak.
Mr Mubarak returned to Cairo at the weekend after visiting France and
Morocco. He has been attempting to defuse a potential international crisis
over Libya's refusal to yield the two Libyans for trial in either the US or
Britain.
France is also seeking four Libyans, including Libyan leader Muammer
Gadaffi's brother-in-law, for questioning over the 1989 bombing of a UTA jet
over Niger, in which 171 passengers and crew died.
Pointedly, the French judge responsible for investigating terrorism cases
issued international arrest warrants for the four Libyans while Mr Mubarak
was in Paris urging the west to show restraint.
The US, Britain and France are working on a Security Council resolution that
would impose limited sanctions against Libya should it continue to refuse to
hand over the Libyan suspects.
Initial sanctions would include a freeze on civil aviation links and a
suspension of diplomatic relations.
Sweden, meanwhile, has rejected a Libyan request for it to host the trial of
the two Libyans suspected of blowing up the Pan Am jet. A spokesman for
Sweden's foreign ministry said the government had decided to turn down the
request, forwarded last Monday.
The official said the trial should be held where the crime took place. He
also urged Libya to abide by Security Council Resolution 731 of January 21
which condemned the bombings and urged Libya to comply with requests to hand
over the suspects.
The Libyan judge investigating the Lockerbie airliner bombing submitted his
resignation yesterday, saying he was being pressed from all sides to violate
the law, Reuter adds from Nicosia.
The judge gave nine reasons why he could not conduct his investigation
properly, including 'insults to the Libyan judiciary ..political pressures
from inside and outside ..and attempts to force me to violate the laws,'
according to the Libyan news agency JANA.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Japan's wildlife stand to be tested
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE fishmongers have greeted the conservationists and government
delegates arriving for an international conference on wildlife trade with
petitions asking them to consider the cultural implications of imposing
trade curbs on bluefin tuna served in Tokyo's more expensive sushi
restaurants.
Keen for recognition as a leader in environmental issues, Japan is hosting
the triennial conference of the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (Cites) beginning today in Kyoto. But it is likely to
have its conservationist credibility tested at the 12-day gathering.
Several controversial proposals to be discussed at the conference, which, as
well as limits on bluefin tuna fishing, include a relaxation of the ivory
trade ban and the listing of tropical timbers for protection, have drawn
strong reaction from affected Japanese business groups, some with links to
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
The conference must deal with a range of awkward issues, among them whether
developed countries have the right to recommend limits on the potentially
profitable trade of developing countries, and whether countries agreeing on
trade limits should receive compensation.
Tokyo did not join the Cites group when formed in 1975, but the foreign
ministry has since identified wildlife trade as an issue where Japan can
play a politically important role. Other issues targeted by a government
intent on lifting its profile include the arms trade and global warming.
Japanese delegates will announce tougher rules for trade in wild animals,
requiring the country of origin to verify an export permit before a
protected animal is shipped. Document falsification will be among the issues
covered in a report to be presented at the conference.
Mr Seizo Handa, chief executive director of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)
Japan, said it was 'appropriate' the conference was to be held in Kyoto
because Japan, after the US, is the second biggest trader in endangered
species. He applauded the government for having taken 'some measures' to
lessen that trade. Japan has not decided how it will vote on the ivory issue
this time round, when five southern African governments will propose
resumption of a limited trade. A compromise, trade in elephant meat and
skins, will also be debated.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Clinton faces his first real test: Two Democrats in the race
for presidential nomination have their best chance to shine in primaries
tomorrow in Georgia and Maryland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER holding his own in the early primaries and caucuses of New England and
the midwestern prairies, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas faces the first
real test of his campaign in Georgia tomorrow.
While he is widely regarded as the Democrats' frontrunner for the
presidential nomination, Mr Clinton is the only one of the four major
candidates who has not yet won a state.
Expectations have been raised so high that he must now not only win in
Georgia, but win convincingly if he is to shake off worries over how much
his campaign has been damaged by questions about his marriage and his
position during the Vietnam war.
The ruddy and smiling governor begins with the advantage of long-standing
ties to Georgia's top Democratic politicians, many of whom joined him on the
Democratic Leadership Council, a moderate policy group which Mr Clinton
chaired until last year.
He has been endorsed by Senator Sam Nunn, Georgia's senior senator, as well
as by Governor Zell Miller, Lieutenant Governor Pierre Howard and most of
the state legislature.
Mr Doug Teper, a Democratic state representative, warns that Mr Paul
Tsongas, who won the New Hampshire primary ten days ago, and the other
candidates are still unknown in Georgia.
'The truth is, this is Clinton territory,' he said.
Mr Teper also notes that Mr Clinton's support among black politicians should
ensure him the overwhelming majority of black votes, which could make up 27
to 30 per cent of the March 3 primary turnout.
After ballots in four states where blacks make up barely 1 per cent of the
population, Georgia and Maryland will be the first states with significant
black populations to vote in this year's presidential nominating process.
Mr Andrew Young, former US ambassador to the United Nations and mayor of
Atlanta, agrees that Governor Clinton should win the support of most black
voters.
But Mr Ed Brown, executive director of the Voter Education Project, an
Atlanta-based foundation, warns that none of the candidates has made the
concerted effort to register black voters that marked the campaigns of the
Rev Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988.
'Much of the black leadership has made its choice, but oftentimes there's a
gulf between what the leadership says and what the masses do . . . it's not
a matter of whether he garners the black vote, it's a question of how much,'
he warns.
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, fresh from his victory in this week's South
Dakota primary, has now launched his Georgia campaign with a less than
heroic assault on Governor Clinton's Vietnam draft history - an issue he
said two weeks ago should not be relevant in the campaign.
Some political commentators have suggested that these questions may resonate
more in the socially conservative and militaristic south than they have done
in the north, but voters encountered at random in Georgia showed little
interest either in what Mr Clinton did during the Vietnam war, or in his
marriage.
'People like my parents couldn't imagine someone not trying to get out of
the war,' said Miss Megan Lee, a student in the university town of Athens.
'They can drop all that on him, that man ain't dead yet,' said Mr Ben
Rutland, an unemployed maintenance man in Forsyth, a rural town south-east
of Atlanta.
Outside Atlanta, few Georgians have any awareness of the election campaign
or any knowledge of the candidates. In this vacuum, the tabloid stories that
have dogged Governor Clinton's campaign may be the only message that sticks
in voters' minds.
'They pop up, these people that never existed before, and all you've got on
them is the dirt the other side pulls up,' said Mr Clay Owens.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Apathy puts Tsongas ahead: Two Democrats in the race for
presidential nomination have their best chance to shine in primaries
tomorrow in Georgia and Maryland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARYLAND promoters portray their state as a microcosm of the US. Neither
northern nor southern, it has a population of 4.7m spread over mountains,
swamp, seashore, cities, and suburbs.
It has farmers, fishermen, blue collar and high technology workers, a large
number of government employees and professionals, minorities and ethnics -
the common thread being that most will not vote in next Tuesday's
presidential primary.
In fact, most do not know there is a primary.
The beneficiary of the voters' apathy and ignorance is likely to be former
Senator Paul Tsongas, a self-styled pro-business liberal and the Democrats'
winner of the New Hampshire primary. Ahead in the polls, he sees the state
as his best opportunity to demonstrate appeal outside his native New
England. Marylanders, who have paid attention enough to know him, perceive
him as a straight-talker - even if the message he carries is one of gloom.
('The Cold War is over; Japan and Germany won.')
Mr Tsongas promises to rebuild the country's manufacturing base and curb
government give-aways. He has also attracted hundreds of committed campaign
workers, like Mr Jeffrey Cohen, a realtor, driven into campaigning for the
first time in his life by the 'lousy' business conditions.
'I like his whole perspective,' says Mr Cohen. 'The country has to make
basic, structural changes, and he understands that. Tsongas is credible. He
worked in the private sector six years. He served in the Peace Corps. That
represents a certain type of mentality you have for life.'
In large states, where campaigns must be conducted mostly by television,
charisma may sway the voters. Not in Maryland, where forthright pragmatism
comes over well at a time when politicians are greatly distrusted.
Mr Keith Haller, a Maryland pollster, believes only about 15 per cent of the
2.1m registered voters will cast ballots. The economic pain and anger which
brought out more than half the eligible voters in the New Hampshire primary
is muted in Maryland, the fifth richest state per capita, where unemployment
is below the national average.
The national job trends have created an amorphous insecurity and pockets of
real hardship, but that has only translated into political awareness among
affluent and older voters and party activists. The former are expected to go
for Mr Tsongas. The latter will be mobilised by party organisations,
political clubs, labour unions, and churches and many of them will go for
Governor Bill Clinton, who is particularly strong among black voters, who
make up 25 per cent of the state.
The 'character issue' which so absorbs the political pundits in their
endless debates over Governor Clinton's rumoured womanising and alleged
draft dodging means little in a community devastated during the 1980s by
low-skilled job losses, crime and drugs.
Mr Clinton has won the support of the black churches and at a recent rally
he was endorsed by the popular Baltimore Mayor Kurk Schmoke. 'We want a man
who gives us hope. The nation cries out for leadership that is concerned and
caring,' intoned the Rev Marion Bascom, one of the city's most influential
ministers at a recent Clinton rally.
Mr Clinton responded with appropriate fervour, calling for a 'new covenant'
between disheartened Americans and their government.
He has been urged to devote more resources to Maryland to challenge Mr
Tsongas, who would then have difficulty winning elsewhere. But Mr Clinton -
and the voters - have been distracted by an increasingly nasty turn in the
campaign which has forced him to focus his energy on his base of support for
the March 10 'Super Tuesday', when most of the southern states will hold
primaries.
There he must respond to charges by Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey that the
'character issues' have made him un-electable against President Bush. There
he must win big before the campaign surges north a week later into Michigan
and Illinois.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Bosnia claims independence poll victory

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE leaders of Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday claimed victory in an
independence poll at the weekend, prompting fears that violence could erupt
soon between the three main national groups in the republic.
Initial results showed more than half the 3.2m electorate had cast their
votes, despite a boycott proclaimed by local leaders of the Serb minority,
which accounts for 31 per cent of the population. Croats, who make up 17 per
cent of Bosnia's 4.3m population, appeared to side with Slavic Moslems, the
republic's biggest national group, in voting for independence.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, the foreign minister of Bosnia, yesterday said: 'If the
European Community is concerned with stability Bosnia should be recognised
at once . . . We expect automatic recognition because the referendum was the
only condition set by the EC.'
EC foreign ministers will discuss Yugoslavia when they hold their regular
monthly meeting today. Any clear vote for independence emerging out of
yesterday's referendum is expected to increase pressure for EC diplomatic
recognition of that republic.
A 'yes' vote in the referendum would deal a mortal blow to Serbia's plans to
keep Bosnia within a Yugoslav federation. Serbs in northern Bosnia on
Saturday reaffirmed their pledge to form a Serbian republic of Bosnia and
secede, if Bosnia's independence from Yugoslavia is recognised.
Diplomats fear that a recent spate of explosions and road blocks,
reminiscent of events in Croatia leading up to the outbreak of war in June,
could presage the violent division of Bosnia. Three people were killed on
Saturday in a gun battle in central Bosnia, when masked gunmen set up road
blocks in retaliation against Croats, who were blockading a munitions
factory supplying the federal army.
The presence of the Serb-dominated army is a major hurdle to Bosnia's quest
for independence. Mr Silajdzic said: 'The Yugoslav army is one of the
inherited problems, but we will negotiate and hold talks. Now everyone knows
what war is like.'
Meanwhile voters in a referendum in the small republic of Montenegro, a
close ally of Serbia, yesterday were expected to vote in favour of remaining
in Yugoslavia, now consisting of only two republics.
The European Community will reconvene its Yugoslav peace conference in
Brussels on March 9, despite the fact the EC's continuing internal
differences over policy towards certain republics make it harder for the
Community to play neutral peace-broker, David Buchan writes from Brussels.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Yeltsin authorises military aircraft sell-off

<TEXT>
MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has authorised the air force to
sell 1,600 outdated military aircraft free of export tax.
The proceeds of the deals - which are to be negotiated by the air force, but
vetted by the Foreign Economic Relations Ministry - are to finance housing
and salary increases for servicemen.
Mr Yeltsin's decree also suggests, somewhat ambitiously, that Dollars 9bn of
the total profits would be reinvested in unspecified aircraft manufacturing
programmes.
Land forces have already been authorised to sell off surplus tanks and
weapons.
On Friday, Mr Mikhail Malei, a presidential adviser suggested that only
hard-currency arms sales could finance the conversion of the country's huge
defence industry to civilian output.
The government is already actively seeking to expand arms sales to bring in
badly needed hard currency. In an attempt to prevent arms falling into the
wrong hands, it is setting up an inter-ministerial committee - representing
economic ministries as well as the military - to supervise exports.
But there is probably little that officials in Moscow can do to prevent the
former Soviet Union from turning into a giant arms bazaar.
Other republics are determined to nationalise Red Army hardware on their
territory not because they want to use it, but so that they might sell it.
In the second largest republic, Kazakhstan, a commodity exchange called
Pax-Alisa has announced plans to begin auctioning off SU-24 MK
fighter-bombers and systems for co-ordinating land and air operations.
As a result of falling discipline and living standards, thefts of military
hardware within the Red Army itself grew three-fold last year, according to
the chief military prosecutor.
Georgia is planning to demand a share of the Black Sea Fleet for its own
coastal defence. Mr Avtandil Tskitishvili, Georgia's first deputy defence
minister, said the republic expected to take over some of the vessels
anchored at the ports of Poti and Ochamchire. But, unlike Ukraine, which has
been arguing with Russia over the Black Sea Fleet, Georgia has no plans to
demand an oath of allegiance from servicemen, even though its ultimate aim
is to have its own armed forces.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Azeris claim Armenians 'killing hundreds'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AZERI refugees, many of whom walked for days across snow-covered mountains,
yesterday accused Armenian militants backed by Russian soldiers of killing
hundreds in the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, Reuter reports from
Agdam, Azerbaijan.
Relatives of the dead, led by women beating their breasts and scratching
their faces in grief, burst into a government guest house in Agdam to demand
that steps be taken to evacuate corpses from Khojali, another Azeri
stronghold just inside Karabakh.
The mob, about 50 strong, smashed furniture and crockery before leaving to
join several hundred more refugees milling through the streets, where red,
green and blue Azeri national flags were draped with black ribbons.
'Help us. You must do something,' screamed one woman who said her husband
and two sons were killed when Armenians seized Khojali last week.
The Azeri government, which has declared a three-day mourning period, said
more than 1,000 people were killed in the attack on Khojali, a town of about
10,000 people.
Armenia put the casualty figure much lower, and said the Armenian population
of Karabakh has been forced to defend itself from Azeri attacks.
'This is a gross exaggeration. The figure could be nowhere near 1,000,' said
a security official in the Armenian capital Yerevan.
A government spokesman said Armenian settlements were under artillery fire
from the Azeri lines, with the villages of Sekhsulan and Yarymjan seized and
set ablaze.
In the past four years of undeclared war over the Transcaucasian territory,
more than 1,000 people have been killed. Nagorno-Karabakh is populated by
Armenians but has been administered by Azerbaijan since 1923.
Military commanders in Moscow have repeatedly denied that their men are
involved in the Azeri-Armenian conflict and on Friday ordered them out of
the enclave.

FT  02 MAR 92 / The European Market: UK stays away from E Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH companies must change their attitudes towards doing business in
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union or face a continuing decline in
market share in the region, according to Mr Norman Wooding, chairman of the
London-based East European Trade Council (EETC).
'Despite the revolutions of 1989, the British are not doing business with
eastern Europe or the CIS,' said Mr Wooding, a former director of
Courtaulds, which ventured into the Soviet market in the 1950s. 'The
opportunities are enormous, but we are not taking advantage of them,' he
added.
Certainly, the political instability in the CIS acts as a deterrent for UK
companies. Mr Janek Geller, managing director of Golodetz (Overseas), a
family firm which first started trading with Russia in 1921, says confidence
has been further dented by the failure of Russian enterprises to meet their
payments.
'Payments can no longer be guaranteed,' he said. Officials at the EETC
estimate that outstanding payments due by former Soviet firms to British
companies total Pounds 2bn.
The break-up of the Soviet Union has also disrupted links between
traditional trading partners. The foreign trade organisations, which acted
on behalf of Soviet enterprises have disappeared.
Shipping goods in and out of the CIS is another problem. 'You can no longer
be sure if you can move goods across from one republic into another. The
republics are putting up their own trade barriers, and have different
currencies,' Mr Geller explained.
Mr Wooding from the EETC says the CIS is likely to attract the big
companies, particularly the oil conglomerates. 'Its a vast market. Only 3
per cent of the identified oil reserves have been extracted; only 9 per cent
of gas reserves. What are UK oil companies waiting for?"
Officials at Britain's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), point out
that many British companies are waiting for the CIS to draw up legislation
on foreign investment, property rights and repatriation of profits. In
addition, UK companies are waiting for cover from the Export Credits
Guarantee Department (ECGD), an arm of the DTI.
Earlier this month, the ECGD made Pounds 280m available for medium-term
export credit cover, and investment insurance for Russia and other
republics. But the release of credit is conditional upon all the CIS
republics adopting IMF-backed reforms. They must also be up-to-date in their
existing debt obligations. In eastern Europe, the ECGD provides cover for
only Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
UK companies interested in trading with the CIS and eastern Europe are
impatient with the ECGD'S cautious approach. 'ECGD cover is hedged with
restrictions, and their premiums are too high,' an official from the EETC
said. 'Their premium is 50 per cent higher than other countries in Europe.
UK companies are forced to add the ECGD premium on to their prices. How can
we be competitive?'
Mr Michael Cooper, who now runs a consultancy company, was instrumental in
getting Lee Cooper jeans into eastern Europe in the 1970s. He believes that
the ECGD's premiums, coupled with the credit squeeze by British banks, are
inhibiting UK companies from venturing into eastern Europe. 'The really
determined ones', he says, 'simply by-pass British financial institutions
and go to Vienna or Frankfurt to seek financing'.
Mr John Busby of APV Baker, a British food processing company which has been
trading with the Soviet Union since the 1970s, says German and Austrian
banks understand industry's needs better than their UK counterparts.
'The Germans, whose trade links with the region go back centuries, take a
long view on investments,' explained Mr Busby. 'Many UK companies, in the
case of eastern Europe, expect profits in the short term. That is a mistake.
They still do not realise that eastern Europe and the CIS is a long haul, a
long commitment, and requires lots of hard work and expertise.'
Mr Wooding believes that innate conservatism, and a persistent ignorance
about eastern Europe and the CIS, have also contributed to the reluctance to
tackle this vast market.
'UK companies hated communism more than their counterparts on the
Continent,' a DTI official explains. The DTI and the EETC believe attitudes
are changing, but slowly.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Single market far from being realised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE creation of the single market is still a long way from being realised
according to a new study* of the European distribution and logistics
industry which reveals big differences in comparative costs and practices.
The distribution sector has traditionally been viewed as being at the
leading edge of an integrated European market, but the report found there
were still considerable barriers to a free flow of goods across borders.
The study of six European markets found that transport infrastructure still
largely reflected the priorities of national governments, leading to
considerable disruption at borders.
Railways, for example, still have a plethora of different voltages,
signalling systems, operating rules, and loading gauges. The study found
that delays at frontiers averaged two hours and were as high as eight hours
at the Spanish border.
Different taxation policies also affected the relative costs of
distribution. Fuel costs may represent 10 per cent to 20 per cent of the
costs of operating a vehicle but the study found that diesel prices at the
pump varied between Ecu252 (Pounds 179) in France and Ecu365 (Pounds 259) in
Italy. Vehicle excise duties also showed great differences. The EC has been
trying to harmonise taxation policy, but is making slow progress.
When total logistics costs were measured as a percentage of sales there was
a marked difference between the Netherlands, at 4.62 per cent, and France,
at 7.22 per cent.
Mr Tony West, of Touche Ross, the management consultancy which helped
prepare the report, said UK companies had not established a clear cost
advantage in the logistics field.
The study covered 836 companies in German, Spain, France, Italy, UK and the
Netherlands.

MR Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of France's extreme right-wing National Front
(FN), was ordered to call off a weekend rally in Corsica because police
could not guarantee his safety, writes William Dawkins from Paris.
Mr Le Pen criticised the decision, by the state's senior representative in
the region, as 'democratic harassment' and accused the government of being
in 'connivance' with Corsican separatists.
Seven policemen were wounded in scuffles in Ajaccio, as Corsican separatists
clashed with an estimated 150 supporters of the FN, which is committed to
keeping Corsica part of France. Earlier, Mr Le Pen's aircraft had to be
diverted after separatists parked trucks on Bastia airport runway.
The FN's campaign for the March 22 regional elections has attracted violent
controversy.

<TEXT>
ANYBODY IN London between March 5 and 8 might like to head for The Business
Design Centre, Islington, north London, where a most uncity-like activity
will be taking place. There, in the midst of one of the capital's most urban
boroughs, The Country Living Fair will be celebrating, in its own inimitable
way, the joys of rural bliss.
Gathered together under one roof will be a large collection of that vast
army of crafts people whose work somehow embodies the rural ideal. Besides
being able to buy almost anything from a beautifully-made rocking horse to a
hand-knitted sweater or a piece of painted furniture, the visitor will be
able to watch many crafts people actually at work.
Potters will be potting, painters painting, country cooks cooking,
embroiderers will be embroidering - every exhibitor has been through a
rigorous selection process and been invited to attend, so standards are high
and the interest should be enormous.
Among so many delights it is hard to choose just a few but Weekend FT
readers will want to know that our own Philippa Davenport, in her capacity
as cookery writer on Country Living magazine, will be there, ready to answer
your culinary questions.
Look out, too, for the fine cotton bedlinen from Cologne and Cotton - prices
are exceptionally good and quality is high. Then there is the stunning blue
and white ware made by Michael and Carol Francis - in particular beautiful
tulip vases and charming brick vases. Then there are Andrew Young's green
jugs and colander bowls, Sally Green's painted furniture, Lloyd Loom
furniture and so much more.
With six pavilions, each representing a different theme (crafts, interiors,
gardens, food and drink, leisure and environment and style) it ought to keep
any keen visitor busy. Tickets cost Pounds 6 for adults. The fair is open
from 10 am every day and closes at 8pm on March 5 and 6, at 6pm on March 7
and 5pm on March 8. The show is virtually sold out and it would be wise to
call the Business Design Centre on 071-288-6461 to check ticket
availability.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Prospects brighten for Ulster talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS FOR new all-party negotiations on the future of Northern Ireland
brightened yesterday, when the leaders of Ulster's four main constitutional
parties agreed that talks could resume after next Friday's Anglo-Irish
meeting in Dublin.
Mr James Molyneaux of the Official Unionists, Mr Ian Paisley of the
Democratic Unionists, Mr John Hume of the SDLP and Mr John Alderdice of the
Alliance party, agreed a joint statement after a private meeting of just
over an hour.
The statement said the party leaders assumed that after next week's
gathering there would be no further conference meeting before the election.
Although the Northern Ireland Office last night welcomed the leaders'
statement, it was not clear that all hurdles had been cleared to allow talks
to start and the proximity of the general election would make the timescale
extremely tight.
A UK general election, if Mr John Major decides on April 9, could be called
as early as the following week.
Mr Major and Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, have made it clear that the
basis of talks would be the same no matter who won the election.
The two party leaders are to be asked next week to confirm these assurances
in writing.
Fresh impetus to break the apparent deadlock in the talks came from a
Downing Street meeting held by Mr Major with Ulster party leaders earlier
this month. Unionist and nationalist leaders agreed then to discuss how
obstacles to formal talks, which had been postponed until after the general
election, could be overcome.
Mr Major called the meeting - the first for 16 years between a prime
minister and all Northern Ireland's political parties - because of the
escalation in terrorist violence in the province.
There have also been claims that, by putting political talks on the back
burner, the government was creating a political vacuum which could be
exploited by terrorists.
Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, is due to meet the four
Northern Ireland leaders on Monday, and there will be a Commons debate on
Northern Ireland next Thursday.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Public schools face up to fees crisis: Pupils are being
withdrawn as the recession hits parents' ability to pay, say heads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUPILS whose parents have fallen behind with school fees are having to leave
England's public schools, as the independent sector experiences its most
acute economic downturn for more more than a decade.
Boarding schools have been worst affected, experiencing an average four per
cent decline in pupil numbers last year even before the recession began to
bite.
At a conference of independent school heads in London this week, almost
every head teacher approached reported some pupils being withdrawn because
parents could not cope with fees.
Most schools represented at the conference have lost three or four pupils
this year - 'but talk to any bursar, and he'll tell you the actual leavers
are the tip of the iceberg', said one head.
With the recession hitting hardest in the south - home to the majority of
public schools - many middle class parents are falling behind with fees, and
some have had to give up trying to pay them.
Mrs Jean Glover, educational grants adviser to the Independent Schools
Information Service, said applications for help had doubled to 1,000 last
year, with a similar number expected this year. Charitable help is available
to keep children at schools, but cannot pay arrears. Many parents left it
too late to ask for help, said Mrs Glover.
None of the big schools is yet threatening to close its doors, but many
smaller institutions - particularly boarding schools - face acute financial
problems. Some heads forecast widespread closures unless the situation
improves.
Independent schools are faced with matching this year's 7.8 per cent
teachers' pay award in the state sector. Fee increases announced this year
are averaging above 9 per cent - more than twice the inflation rate, after a
decade of steeply increasing fees.
Even before the increase, annual fees averaged Pounds 6,700 a year for
boarding schools, and Pounds 3,600 for day schools.
Mr Jeremy Nichols, headmaster of Stowe School, Bucks, said: 'Things are
clearly tight. The recession has hit our parents as much as anybody else. We
are all concerned because of the current situation, but at the moment it is
not panic measures.'
Only one pupil has been withdrawn because of problems with fees, according
to Mr Nichols. 'We do try to help out in cases of real need and distress.
Provided that parents get in touch with the school bursar that is fine. One
would hate to pull the rug from a child on financial grounds,' he said.
Major Gerard Cox, bursar of Badminton School, Bristol, said that the school
had lost two or three pupils in the last six months. 'At the beginning of
term I rather thought we were going to have problems.
'People rang up and said, 'Awfully sorry, old boy, it's going to be a bit
late this year.' But what I thought would be a flood has remained a trickle.
In fact, the speed our fees were paid this term was the fastest ever.' He
suggested that many parents gave school fees priority over other bills.
'People are very optimistic. They tend to say, 'once the recession is over,
we shan't need help,''.
However, a prominent West Country school reported that only 92 per cent of
its fees had been collected in January, against 98 per cent for the same
month last year. 'When you work on our margins, that's a pretty gloomy
position', said its head.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Gangsters go to law for protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GANGSTERS in the Japanese city of Matsumoto have acquired a new identity -
Matsumoto Corporation, specialising in property development and interior
decorating.
Like many Japanese criminal organisations - or yakuza - the Matsumoto gang
has registered as a company to try to evade an anti-gangster law which comes
into effect today.
Others are claiming to offer services from landscape gardening and golf
course management to running old people's homes. A gang in rural Fukui plans
to specialise in weddings and funerals.
The law, and the gangsters' response, highlights the ambivalence of Japanese
attitudes to yakuza. There is widespread condemnation of drug dealing, the
criminals' biggest source of profit, but some tolerance of their traditional
enterprises of gambling and prostitution because many people use these
services. Also, Japanese society is highly regimented and yakuza groups
provide work for those Japanese who find it difficult to conform.
The police say the law is a reaction to a change in yakuza over the past
decade. The gangsters used to keep to themselves but are increasingly
aggressive towards ordinary Japanese people, pushing into legitimate
business such as property development.
The police are most worried about the consolidation of yakuza into
nationwide organisations. Yamaguchi Gumi, Japan's largest yakuza group,
accounts for about 30 per cent of the 90,000 gangsters known to police.
Gang leaders have developed into sophisticated businessmen with links with
some of Japan's top companies. Sagawa Kyubin, the transport company at the
centre of a growing scandal, allegedly lent large amounts of money to
companies connected to Mr Susumu Ishii, the former boss of Inagawakai,
Japan's second-largest gangster group, who died last year.
The law strengthens police power to prevent yakuza threatening ordinary
people. Until now the police have only been able to arrest yakuza for
threatening behaviour if they could prove the use or threat of force.
Victims have often been too frightened to give evidence.
Police will now be able to arrest members of designated gangs for extorting
protection money under the guise of donations, expelling sitting tenants and
extracting phoney sub-contracting orders from companies.
The law also prohibits a favourite yakuza ploy - collecting compensation on
behalf of victims of traffic accidents.
Faced with this challenge, yakuza have gone to their lawyers, who advised
turning gangs into incorporated companies.
Following lawyers' advice, Yamaguchi Gumi this week sent a faxed message to
hundreds of its affiliates urging gangs to register as companies, with the
bosses filling the posts of chairman, president and vice-president.
Earlier this month, yakuza staged a demonstration in central Tokyo claiming
the law infringed their rights. Yakuza said on television they too had to
make a living. One even explained why they favoured large cars, such as
Cadillacs. The body was made of thicker steel than a Japanese car, he said,
and was better at withstanding bullets.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Hurd hits at Labour plans for Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, yesterday led a Tory offensive
against opposition proposals for constitutional change in Scotland.
He labelled Labour's plan for a devolved parliament as 'disingenuous and
devious'. He also attacked the Scottish National party's proposal for an
independent Scotland within the EC.
His remarks came as serious divisions arose among supporters of a devolved
parliament at the Scottish Constitutional Convention. The convention,
composed mainly of Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians, has been drawing
up plans for a Scottish parliament.
It proposes gender equality by placing parties under statutory obligation to
put up equal numbers of men and women.
Mr Christopher Mason was one of several Liberal Democrats, including women,
who disagreed with the proposals. He said it was 'a democratic nonsense'
that a person who received fewer votes might be elected in place of someone
with more votes because of he was the 'wrong' sex.
Mr Hurd, speaking at Renfrew near Glasgow, accused Labour of backing a
devolved parliament in order to take power in Scotland.
He said it was 'patently absurd and unfair' to 'strip the Westminster
parliament of the right to legislate on most Scottish matters, but then let
Scots MPs determine those same areas of policy for England, Wales and
Northern Ireland'.
As for the SNP's policy of independence in Europe, it was a fantasy that
'Scotland could slide out of the UK and slide simultaneously into the EC as
an equal and independent state'. It would probably have to negotiate entry
into the EC, he said.

FT  29 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks fail to sustain
their early gains
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US MARKETS finished a volatile week in mixed form. Share prices rose
strongly in the morning, following better consumer confidence figures and an
upward revision of fourth quarter gross domestic product, but fell back amid
profit-taking to end slightly lower, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 1.78 at 3,267.67, having at one
stage been more than 20 points higher. The more broadly based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 ended down 1.14 at 412.72, while the Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks slipped 0.49 to 633.46. Turnover on the NYSE was
203m shares.
After a raft of conflicting economic statistics in recent days, yesterday's
news was on the upbeat side. The revision in fourth quarter GDP was
expected, but the change from the original estimate of a 0.3 per cent rise
in GDP to a 0.8 per cent rise was slightly bigger than anticipated.
In addition, the University of Michigan's consumer confidence index for
February showed a modest improvement in sentiment, which helped offset
Tuesday's big drop in consumer confidence as measured by the Conference
Board.
Auto stocks were in demand after Merrill Lynch, the big securities house,
upgraded its intermediate-term rating on the big three manufacturers from
'neutral' to 'above average'. General Motors rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars
37 1/2 , Chrysler Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 17 and Ford Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 37.
May Department Stores rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 61 7/8 on the news that
the company plans to dissolve a real estate partnership with Prudential
Insurance, which will allow May to take a Dollars 200m pre-tax gain in its
second quarter earnings.
Coca-Cola rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 81 3/4 after investors shrugged off
news of a multi-million dollar lawsuit filed by 7-Up Company alleging that
Coca-Cola was disrupting 7-Up's arrangements in the lemon and lime segment
of the soft drinks market.
McDonnell Douglas fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 63 1/2 after Taiwan
Aerospace said it may reduce its investment in the US company's airliner
business from 40 per cent, as originally planned, to as low as 25 per cent.
Callaway Golf, makers of the popular Big Bertha driver, enjoyed an
impressive first full day on the market. The stock finished at Dollars 32
3/8 , well up on the initial offering price of Dollars 20.
Home Shopping Network jumped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 8 1/4 on the news that
the cable television group is in talks about a possible merger with rival
shopping network QVC.
On the over-the-counter market, MCI Communications rose Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 35 in turnover of 2.9m shares after the company won a two-year
contract for long-distance telephone services from the US federal
government.
Novell slipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 61 3/4 despite fiscal first quarter
net income of 34 cents a share that was in line with expectations.
SunWest Financial Services rose Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 32 1/4 after the
New Mexico-based finance group said it was considering merger proposals from
several parties.
Canada
TORONTO closed mixed in moderate trading. The TSE-300 closed at 3,581.94,
down 2.14, although advances led declines by 299 to 283 in volume of 26.8m
shares. Trading value fell to CDollars 285.5m from Dollars 384.2m.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Appointments: NHBC builds on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Norman Fowler (right), the former secretary of state for employment who
resigned to spend more time with his family, has agreed to become chairman
of the National House-Building Council.
He takes over from former Halifax chief executive John Spalding in May, by
which time Sir Norman could be in opposition - or unable to take up the post
because he is back in the cabinet. He laughs off the latter suggestion:
'Goodness me. I haven't given that any thought.'
NHBC, which provides insurance for owners of new homes, attracted him
'because of its contribution to ensuring high standards in house-building,
and because of the very good consumer protection it offers,' he says.
The Council, in turn, was pleased to lure Sir Norman, as it thinks he will
be useful in the course of its planned expansion into the Continent, where
Britain is well ahead of most countries in the concept of new house
insurance.
Sir Norman says he has 'about four' other directorships but that he is
reviewing existing commitments. He accepted NHBC 'because I much prefer
being chairman to doing anything else'.
Trade and Industry secretary Peter Lilley is currently considering how to
deal with a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report that an aspect of the
council's rules is anti-competitive. Sir Norman says it has 'all taken place
before I arrived', and he insists that he does not expect to play any part
in the deliberations now or later. He also points out that the European move
reflects a recognition on NHBC's part that 'life will not be entirely the
same as before'.

<TEXT>
CHARTERED WestLB, the London-based international merchant bank jointly owned
by Standard Chartered and WestLB, made profits of Pounds 21.2m in 1991, up
from Pounds 16m.
Mr Patrick Macdougall, chief executive, said that almost all activities had
been profitable and the return on average capital employed had risen from 28
to 35.7 per cent. Assets advanced to Pounds 1.67bn (Pounds 1.24bn).
Developing country finance remained the largest contributor to profits.
Turnover in Latin American debt rose by 70 per cent to Dollars 16bn (Pounds
9.1bn).
Chartered WestLB carries out a wide range of mergers and acquisitions
advisory work in London, Germany, and eastern Europe. It is also preparing
to launch a new securitisation product with SG Warburg, based on receivables
including credit card debt.
A forfaiting operation launched in 1991 was in profit and had concluded over
200 individual purchases in the year, totalling more than Dollars 500m and
involving exports to 26 countries.

FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Emap buys MBC London titles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF the Maxwell Busi-ness Communications group has been sold in a deal
believed to be worth about Pounds 32m.
Emap, the publishing and exhibitions group, yesterday agreed to buy all the
MBC titles based in central London. It is also acquiring Trenton Group, an
exhibitions company.
Mr Brian Gilbert, MBC chairman until he resigned in November 1990 after
disagreements with the late Mr Robert Maxwell, is buying 25 industrial
titles based in Kent. They include Modern Power Systems, Office Equipment
News and Laboratory World.
For Mr Gilbert it is a case of buying back a large part of what once was
his. He built up United Trade Press and sold it to Mr Maxwell in 1987 for
Pounds 34.8m. Mr Gilbert said yesterday that the businesses he was buying
back from the administrator have a similar turnover to those which he sold
to Mr Maxwell.
Price Waterhouse yesterday declined to disclose the sale price but it is
believed that Mr Gilbert's slice of the deal comes to about Pounds 10m.
The deals, due to be completed next week, secure the jobs of more than 400
staff on more than 40 MBC magazines and exhibitions. Price Waterhouse has
now disposed of the main UK businesses of Maxwell Communication Corporation.
For Emap, heavily weighted towards consumer magazines, the acquisition means
a major strengthening of its business magazine division.
Mr Colin Morrison, chairman of Emap Business Publishing, said that the
growth of consumer magazines had been an Emap success story. 'This purchase
opens the way for our business publishing division to emulate that
achievement.'
The Emap purchases include blocks of magazines devoted to the architecture
and building, retail, media, fishing and financial fields.

FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Hillsdown canner deal referred to MMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACQUISITION last September by Hillsdown Holdings of Anglia Canners from
Associated British Foods was yesterday referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission. The MMC has until May 27 to report.
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry can refer a merger up to six
months after it goes through and can order it to be unravelled if it is
found to have created a situation against the public interest. Meanwhile
Hillsdown will continue to run the business which has been merged with its
own canning subsidiary.
Hillsdown has already closed the vegetable canning activities of Anglia
Canners because of overcapacity in the market. Hillsdown's canning operation
was the largest in the UK before the deal.
Sir Harry Solomon, chairman, said it would be complicated to unravel the
merger now. He said Anglia Canners had been losing money when acquired and
had been rationalised.
The deal was worth Pounds 20.6m at the time, with the price paid in
Hillsdown shares. The operation also makes ready meals and canned fruit, but
these are not under investigation. The canned vegetable market is worth
Pounds 300m-Pounds 400m a year, and Hillsdown is now thought to have about a
third of it.
The Office of Fair Trading, which recommended the reference, appeared
particularly concerned about canned garden peas, carrots and potatoes where
it is estimated that the merged group has more than half the market. It was
felt growers might suffer if there were too limited an outlet.
Much of the production of the merged business is for supermarkets' own-label
canned vegetables, making it difficult to assess market shares.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Letter: Scotland shows landlords how
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G E WEBSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest the article by Vanessa Houlder on the property
page ('Landlords' common front', February 21) dealing with the fears of
English landlords in the face of proposals to repeal legislation that allows
recovery of unpaid rent from former tenants.
Perhaps I could spread some calm by pointing out that in Scotland it has
never been the case that a tenant who assigns is required to remain liable
for these conditions in the case of default by the assignee. The system
works satisfactorily and in itself has no effect on capital values.
Obviously in the alienation clause of the lease, Scottish landlords ensure
there are stiff conditions imposed in their favour for approval of
assignations, particularly with regard to financial strength. The route of
sub-letting of the space is always open where of course the original tenant
does indeed remain liable for his sub-tenants' performance.
If English solicitors consult their Scottish counterparts they should find
well established solid rules that can be adopted to nullify the politicians'
excesses.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Letter: CBI challenges the view that UK is in longest and
deepest recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW SENTANCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It appears to be accepted that the UK economy is in the longest -
though not the deepest - recession since the second world war. This was the
main theme of your coverage last week of the provisional gross domestic
product figures for the fourth quarter. A closer examination reveals that
this is not the case.
The longest continuous period of decline is still the five quarters ending
in the first quarter of 1981. This is because the decline in GDP that has
been under way since the middle of 1990 was interrupted in the third quarter
of 1991 by a slight rise.
The rise in GDP in the third quarter of last year has now turned out to be a
blip caused by a bounce back in oil production. However, if we are to
exclude such blips in activity from our calculations, the decline in GDP in
the mid-1970s appears to be the longest, with GDP falling from the third
quarter of 1973 and a sustained recovery not beginning until two years
later.
Douglas McWilliams (Letters, November 25, 1991) suggested an alternative
definition of recession: the period of time until the economy has recovered
to reach the previous peak in output. On this definition, the recessions in
the mid-1970s and early 1980s both lasted over three years.
By this rule, we will not know whether we have been in the longest post-war
recession until we have the figures for GDP in the third quarter of 1993.
In all this analysis, we are not really comparing like with like. The
historical data, with which the most recent figures are compared, have been
significantly revised since their first publication. Such revisions have
often been much larger than the 0.2 per cent rise in GDP recorded in the
third quarter of 1991, or the 0.3 per cent fall in the fourth quarter.
It is, therefore, premature to describe the current recession as the longest
since 1945. Such statements may well be proved incorrect by subsequent
events - and data revisions - which economic commentators may not have been
very good at anticipating]

FT  29 FEB 92 / When Irish eyes smile: A possible coalition deal at
Westminster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within 24 hours of election day, Mr John Major, the prime minister, may face
an anguished choice between telephoning Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the
Ulster Unionist party, or calling the removal men.
With opinion polls suggesting that neither the Tories nor Labour will win a
majority, a pact between the Conservatives and Unionist MPs is edging up the
scale of possible outcomes.
Although the Conservative party says an outright victory is its only aim,
senior members of the party have weighed the possible gains and losses of a
pact with Northern Ireland's unionists - the Ulster Unionist Party and the
Democratic Unionist Party - and have considered how the wooing might be
done. Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, has acknowledged that a
deal is possible, while Mr Major has not ruled it out.
In the event of a hung parliament, such calculations would determine whether
a minority Tory government could survive or whether Labour would be given a
chance to form an administration. It could prevent an early second general
election.
The Ulster Unionist party is a likely first choice for Mr Major should he
search for a coalition partner. The Liberal Democrats, now with 22 MPs, have
strengthened their demands for electoral reform and would demand ministerial
posts. If the election result is tight, a deal with the nine Ulster Unionist
MPs (a number unlikely to change much in the election) may be enough for the
Conservatives to hold on to power.
Mr Molyneaux would probably seize a chance to influence the governance of
Northern Ireland, particularly if the alternative were a Labour government
and its policy of unification of Ireland by consent.
But it would be a marriage of convenience rather than shared aspirations.
Although the two parties have had close ties since the 19th century, a wedge
was driven between them by the 1972 imposition of 'direct rule' from
Westminster which ended Unionist control over government in the province.
Ulster Unionists no longer take the Conservative whip, and they sit on the
opposite side of the Commons chamber.
Personalities would also clash. The 71-year-old Mr Molyneaux is a canny,
old-school Westminster operator who dislikes undue media attention or
high-tension negotiations. His colleagues are similarly unambitious, unused
to the disciplines required to support a government with a fragile majority.
No more than a handful are at Westminster for more than a day or two a week.
Northern Ireland is their main concern. Views on other issues vary but are
usually conservative, sometimes more so than the Conservative party.
The Rev Ian Paisley, the voluble leader of the Democratic Unionist Party,
and the DUP's two other MPs may also be persuaded to support the
Conservatives. But Mr Paisley's rumbustious character makes any deal-making
an unenviable task.
In pursuing a pact, Mr Major's negotiating tactics might run something like
this. First, Ulster Unionists would be offered an opt-out clause for
Commons' votes affecting mainly the province but be expected to support the
Tories in other areas. There might be some fudges. On parliament's
endorsement of the Maastricht summit - an area where most Ulster Unionists
would want to express disquiet, a minority Tory government could perhaps
rely on sufficient votes from Liberal Democrat or Labour MPs.
Second, the prime minister would meet some of the Unionists' demands. Mr
Molyneaux wants a Commons select committee to scrutinise the administration
of Northern Ireland business - long blocked by the government pending
agreement on a devolved government in the province. Promises of fuller
debate of Northern Ireland legislation would follow and then, possibly, more
powers for local councils. The Unionists may ask for internment but could be
satisfied by assurances of tighter security in the province.
The Ulster Unionists would also push hard for a renegotiation of the 1985
Anglo-Irish Agreement which, they believe, gives the Irish government too
much say in the running of Northern Ireland. That would pose difficulties
for Mr Major. It is an internationally recognised treaty, at the centre of a
a government policy of bringing Unionist and nationalist leaders to the
negotiating table. Changes would have to be agreed with Dublin.
In practice, however, government policy on Northern Ireland would already
have been undermined. A Conservative-Ulster Unionist pact would end
government claims to be a neutral arbiter of talks. Because Mr Brooke has
championed such a neutral approach he would probably have to be replaced.
'Round-table' talks, involving all of the parties to the Northern Ireland
troubles would be hard to achieve. The government would be playing to Mr
Molyneaux's 'integrationist' instincts, ruling the province like any other
part of the UK.
Mr Major might find that prospect unpalatable. For many Tories, it would be
an unwelcome step back towards the Unionist hegemony in Northern Ireland
prior to 1972. It would also sour UK relations with the Irish government.
Improved relations with Dublin have been central to Mr Major's initiative
towards Northern Ireland. A pact with the Unionists would jeopardise that
stance. It would not provide a coherent alternative.
The result, given the lessons of two decades of 'troubles' in Northern
Ireland, would probably be a continuing political vacuum in the province.
Terrorism would not stop. Notwithstanding the gains for the Conservative
party, Mr Major would have to decide whether it was a price worth paying to
remain in Downing Street.

FT  29 FEB 92 / A little local difficulty: The royal row caused by
Australia's Paul Keating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The narrow ways of English folk are not for such as we; They bear the
long-accustomed yoke of staid conservancy: But all our roads are new and
strange And through our blood there runs The vagabonding love of change that
drove us westward of the range and westward of the suns'
 - A B 'Banjo' Patterson, 1890
Mr Paul Keating, Australia's Labor prime minister, struck a raw nerve among
Britain's remaining imperialists this week by asserting Australian
independence and criticising Britain's conduct of the second world war.
His outspoken comments came at the end of a fortnight in which British blood
had already been heated to boiling point by a number of 'insults' allegedly
delivered to the Queen by Mr Keating and his wife Annita in the course of a
royal tour. Mrs Keating's failure to curtsy to the Queen was an ideal story
for the 'rat pack' of tabloid journalists which follows the monarch on
overseas trips, as was a supposedly pro-republican speech made by Mr Keating
at a reception in Canberra.
But seen from the south Pacific, the jingoism of much of the reaction seems
to throw more light on some Britons' addiction to the dregs of empire than
on the development of Australian nationalism.
The tone was best captured by the Daily Star, which told its readers that
'Australia's loathsome Labour leaders have found a new sport. It's called
Mocking Her Majesty.'
The paper seemed most upset that Mr Keating had touched the Queen during the
Canberra reception. The prime minister 'slapped his arm around the Queen's
waist as if she was a Sheila by the sheep-dip,' it reported.
The comment reflects a historical view of Australia (and its neighbour New
Zealand) as Britain's south Pacific farm, a role it fulfilled from the
mid-19th century until the mid-1970s. But it is a long time since
Australians have been 'British to their bootstraps,' as Sir Robert Menzies,
conservative prime minister from 1946 to 1965, once said.
Even a casual visitor cannot fail to notice that Australia is fast becoming
a multi-racial society, in which traditional ties to the so-called Mother
Country are fading rapidly. Post-war immigration from southern Europe, Asia
and the Middle East has cut the proportion of Australians with direct
British links to less than 60 per cent from more than 90 per cent 40 years
ago. And while many Australians still head for London when they go overseas,
perhaps clutching a British passport inherited from an immigrant father or
grandfather, many others head for Greece, Italy or Hong Kong.
Trade links with the UK are also declining in importance - about 65 per cent
of Australian exports now go to Asia, compared with less than 15 per cent to
the whole of the European Community.
The change of national direction has been difficult for many of the current
generation of political and business leaders, few of whom speak an Asian
language or have close personal links with Asian leaders. But it has
contributed to a growing feeling that the time has come for Australia to
consider completing the long drift away from Britain, a drift which has been
going on since the continent's six colonies formed a federation in 1901.
Federation made Australia an independent dominion within the British Empire,
as Canada and South Africa were at that time. This status gave Australia a
single national government, while the Queen remained head of state. It was
encouraged by London and supported by most Australians.
However, federation also had the effect of neutralising the nationalist
movement, which had achieved some prominence in the 1890s as a result of
socialist activism and the stories and poems of writers such as 'Banjo'
Patterson.
Nationalists made some headway during the first world war. Many Australians
blamed the British, and in particular Winston Churchill, for the disaster at
Gallipoli, where 7,600 Australians were killed fighting the Turks - about a
quarter of the British and French casualties.
Resentment of Britain's allegedly callous treatment of Australian troops led
voters to reject a referendum on changing the constitution to allow
conscription and hence enable increased support for Britain's war effort.
The most important change in the relationship took place in December 1941,
when John Curtin, the wartime prime minister, turned to the US for help
against a threatened Japanese invasion. There was some unease in Australia
about Curtin's statement that the country turned to the US 'free of any
pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the less, his declaration
ended Australia's military dependence on Britain and began the process of
coming to terms with its Pacific geography.
Since then, Australian governments have also ended judicial appeals to
London, replaced God Save the Queen with Advance Australia Fair, and
formally separated the British and Australian thrones, although the British
monarch is still automatically Queen of Australia.
Against this background, it would be impossible for a modern Australian
prime minister to greet the Queen, as Sir Robert once did, with the couplet
which Sir Walter Raleigh is believed to have penned in praise of Queen
Elizabeth I: 'I did but see her passing by/And yet I love her till I die.'
Yet it is worth looking at what Mr Keating actually said in his speech last
week, which reportedly upset the Queen. The most important passage referred
to the difference between 1954, when thousands of Australians lined the
streets to see the Queen's first visit, and 1992, when the crowds were far
fewer.
'This is an altogether different generation, reflecting a profound change in
our two countries and the relationship between them. As our constitutional
relationship has evolved, so have the circumstances of our economic and
political lives,' he said.
'These days we must both face the necessities of a global economy and global
change of often staggering speed and magnitude. We must also face regional
realities. Just as Britain some time ago sought to make her future secure in
the European Community, so Australia now vigorously seeks partnerships with
countries in our own region. Our outlook is necessarily independent.'
In itself, the speech did no more than set out the realities of the
relationship. In speaking of the Queen as a foreigner, Mr Keating clearly
intended to make a small gesture towards Australian nationalism. Mrs
Keating's failure to curtsy, within the bounds of royal protocol, will have
the same effect.
But what is odd about the incident is that anyone should have been
surprised. Labor has been committed to a republic for a decade, and last
year formally pledged to aim for the abolition of the monarchy by 2001, the
centenary of federation.
Nor is Mr Keating Australia's first republican prime minister. Both Mr Bob
Hawke, his predecessor, and Mr Gough Whitlam, Labor premier from 1972 to
1975, made no secret of their view that Australia should become a republic.
Far from embarrassing Mr Keating, criticism from Britain may help to rescue
Labor's fading chances of winning the 1993 federal election by allowing it
to present itself as the party of Australian patriotism. Mr Keating appeared
to be taking this line when he was questioned about the issue in parliament.
The prime minister responded by accusing Britain of abandoning Australia to
the imperial Japanese army in 1942 by failing to defend the Malaysian
peninsula properly, allowing the garrison in Singapore to fall, and
attempting to prevent the return of the Australian Seventh Division, which
was wanted for home defence.
These allegations are uncontroversial in Australia, although some historians
take the more generous view that Britain did what it could in the Pacific in
the light of more pressing strategic priorities elsewhere.
Early opinion polling indicated that about two-thirds of Australians thought
the criticism justified.
The rumpus leaves the republican movement rubbing its hands over the
publicity its cause has received. 'It is ironic that the Queen's visit has
given the biggest impetus to the campaign that we have had for years,' says
Labor senator Mr Chris Schacht, a veteran republican campaigner.
'The British tabloids can say what they like about us, they are totally
irrelevant to Australia's future, as Britain itself is. It is quite clear
now that a republic is inevitable.'

FT  29 FEB 92 / Letter: Use of life assurance ratios data for cost
comparisons deemed to be 'inappropriate'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R H RANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is a great pity that the article by John Authers ('Hidden costs that
can make life policies so expensive', February 22) further confuses the
debate about life office expenses. The data on which the quoted ratios are
based have been available in the public domain since the current regulations
came into force in 1984. That it has not been used before for the purpose
quoted is probably because it is inappropriate to do so. The results can be
misleading, as they could be for the Securities and Investments Board
comments on lapses which were drawn from a similar source.
An example is that the new business figures in the form reported to the
Department of Trade and Industry returns are based upon certain definitions.
In the case of this office, that results in an understatement of the true
position. Similarly, it is likely that the author has left in his
calculations the society's unit-linked and non-profit business despite the
claim to deal only with with-profits business. Similar discrepancies must
arise with the other offices quoted and must cast doubt on the figures. A
further serious deficiency is that the DTI returns show absolute expenses.
With contracts like endowment assurances, there is almost certainly for all
life offices some netting down of those expenses when passing on to
policyholders to allow for the effect of tax relief.
Life offices are much criticised for resisting pressure to move away from
the 'reduction in yield' concept - a concept which makes comparison of
expenses between life offices and between the life industry and deposit
taking institutions straightforward. For example, one life office might say,
'if we can earn 10 per cent on investments, the effect of our expenses will
be as if we had earned 8 per cent', whereas another might say 'the effect is
as if we had earned 7 per cent'. A clear, simple way of identifying
differences.
The life offices continue to resist other types of disclosure not because of
a wish to hide their expenses, but simply because they know that all other
methods so far advanced by commentators, whose knowledge and understanding
of our business is unlikely to be so deep, do not do the job adequately. The
range of contracts on the market and their variety of charging methods is so
great that it is difficult to find a method of expressing the effect of
different charges and their incidence in a way which is not misleading.
Rather than subjecting the life industry to a continuous barrage of
criticism and putting forward ill-founded alternatives, it might be more
helpful to the consumer if commentators attempted to explain the life
offices' stance a bit more objectively.
Since my office appeared as the most competitive regarding charges in your
article, no doubt you will accept that I have no particular axe to grind. My
concern is to generate some objective discussion.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Tidal wave of anger: Americans are starting to vent their
frustration
</HEADLINE>

Across the US, voters are sending a damning message to President George Bush
as his campaign for re-election in November limps from the recession-scarred
north through the midwestern prairies to the sunbelt. The 'primal scream' of
anger registered in New Hampshire, where only 53 per cent of Republicans
gave their vote to the incumbent president, was a strident warning that
people are not persuaded by his expressions of care and understanding for
their economic predicament.
The point was brought home in a Time/CNN poll last week that showed 59 per
cent of those questioned felt Mr Bush did not understand the problems of the
average American.
Mr Ben Rutland, an unemployed maintenance worker in Forsyth, a small town in
rural Georgia, summed up the message: 'I voted for Bush, but I ain't going
to vote for him any more. Bush has got to go because this economy's dying.'
Mr Clayburn Durham, who owns the village store in Fair Play, South Carolina,
concurs: 'The money's not coming across the counter quite like it used to. A
lot of people are saying this isn't a recession, it's a small depression.'
Despite the outpouring of anger caused by the current recession,
measurements such as the national unemployment rate - now 7.1 per cent,
compared with an average of 9.5 per cent in 1982 and 1983 - indicate that it
is milder than recent downturns.
But the anguish of voters appears much keener: this week, the Conference
Board, a New York-based business organisation, reported that its index of
consumer confidence had dropped to its lowest level since 1974, despite
economic statistics showing that business activity might be starting to pick
up.
'For the first time the American people don't think their children are going
to have as good a life as they've had - forget better,' says Ms Lynn Cutler,
vice-chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
Particularly acute has been the pain of the middle class. Almost 90 per cent
of Americans claim to belong to this category, but a growing number say they
have been driven down the scale, or fear that they will be.
'We used to be in the middle class but we're now in the lower class. There
used to be three classes, upper, middle and lower; now there's just rich and
poor,' says Mr Durham, in Fair Play.
Beyond the normal recessionary fear of job losses - and white-collar jobs
have been hit more severely than in previous downturns - many Americans fear
a wider range of personal disasters: lack of personal health insurance, the
cost of a college education for their children, and falling house values.
For those in employment, there is the worry that they may be unable to
change jobs because a new employer would not want to provide health coverage
for their sickly child, or to pay for medical treatment for their dependent
parents.
Health care forced its way on to the national agenda in November when it
became a significant issue in the surprising election of Democratic Senator
Harris Wofford in a Pennsylvania by-election.
President Bush this month outlined a hastily drafted plan intended to help
most of the 35m Americans who have no health insurance to obtain coverage.
But a study by the National Association of Community Health Centres argues
that another 8m people supposedly covered by the Medicare and Medicaid
public insurance schemes in fact receive inadequate medical care.
Perhaps the most immediate concern for some middle-class Americans is the
declining value of the houses they bought at inflated prices during the
1980s. Nationwide, house prices recovered slightly in January after sliding
5 per cent in the second half of 1991, according to the National Association
of Realtors. In the north-east, however, the fall has been sharper and more
protracted, and house prices have still not returned to their 1988 levels.
'A lot of the net worth of many Americans is caught up in their home values.
That's the foundation of their spending patterns,' says Mr Clayton Yeutter,
who has just resigned the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee
to become President Bush's chief domestic policy adviser.
'It's been a rather rude shock for a lot of folks to discover that their net
worth has shrunk during this recessionary period because of the decline in
home values.'
Many homeowners, however, have not only seen the value of their investment
shrink but have actually lost the roof over their heads as they have been
unable to keep up payments on their mortgages.
Mr Mohammed Ndiaye, for example, bought a house five years ago, eking out
his salary from the De Kalb County local government, in the eastern
outskirts of Atlanta, by driving a taxi part-time. Born in Nigeria, he lost
his home in December after he was laid off by De Kalb, and is now a
full-time taxi-driver.
'I've been a citizen for two and a half years and never voted, but this year
I'm going to vote. Life was so sweet when the Democrats were in there. It's
terrible, it's just like a third world country.'
Mr Percival Bryan shares Mr Ndiaye's occupation of taxi-driver, but not his
assessment of the current economic climate. Now 86, he lived through the
depression of the 1930s and recalls driving Mr Harry S Truman around
Washington when he was an obscure senator from Missouri, before he became
president. 'Some of these people were living too high anyway - living high
on the hog, with two- and three-car garages and such,' he says.
While individuals wrestle with the debts that have accumulated through job
losses and homelessness, overhanging them all is this year's Dollars 400bn
federal budget deficit, which will hamstring the administration's ability to
stimulate economic recovery through higher public spending.
'I would definitely be in favour of the candidate who's going to do
something about the national debt and quit strewing money around,' says Mr
Clay Owens, who works at Yoders Building Supplies, down the road from Mr
Durham's store in Fair Play.
But in Washington, only a handful of politicians show any concern about the
deficit and the debt they will be handing down to their children. Voters
speak scathingly of politicians of all hues for their inability to dig the
country out of its economic mess, but the fall-out appears more damaging to
President Bush and the Republicans than to the Democrats.
Despite his best efforts to shift the blame for recession onto the
Democrat-dominated Congress, Mr Bush, born and raised in wealth, has not
convinced voters that he can address or even comprehend their difficulties.
Even Senator Sam Nunn, the austere and earnest Georgian who chairs the
Senate Armed Services committee, has started to crack jokes about Mr Bush's
scant experience of daily existence. At a gathering of Georgia Democrats
last week he sneered at the president's apparent astonishment on his first
encounter with a modern electronic supermarket check-out, and gibed that Mr
Bush planned to polish his down-to-earth image with voters in the south,
where hunting, shooting and fishing are a way of life, by installing
gunracks in his speedboat.
As the debate over the economy quickens, the Democratic party hopes to
capitalise on Mr Bush's difficulties to reclaim the presidency it has held
for only four of the past 24 years.
'People are scared to death in this country. You mustn't underestimate the
level of fear and anger that exists in the American people today,' says Ms
Cutler.
So far, however, the four main Democrats who have entered the race for their
party's presidential nomination - Senator Paul Tsongas, Governor Bill
Clinton, Senator Bob Kerrey and Senator Tom Harkin have largely failed to
deliver a message that connects with the electorate.
'People are frustrated, angry and in many ways very cynical. I don't think
there is a candidate who comes to the table who has been able to tap into
that anger, so people are forced into voting negatively,' says Mr Ed Brown,
executive director of the Voter Education Project, an Atlanta-based
foundation working to increase black participation in the electoral process.
Many voters are far from convinced that politicians from either party can
solve the country's problems and set it on a more prosperous road.
'It's going to take the people to get us out of this. Everybody keeps saying
it's the president, but it's got to be the people,' says Mrs Jean Whiten,
daughter of Mr Durham, Fair Play's shopkeeper. 'The way things have gone
it's so bad the only thing now is for the country to go plum busted and
start anew,' concludes her father.
