FT  29 FEB 92 / Oversize and out of town: Concern over the impact of
shopping centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government must face up to the impact that big new out of town shopping
centres have on established retail locations, warns a report commissioned by
the Department of the Environment.
The document draws attention to the plight of many town and city centres,
declining against a background of recession and fierce competition from out
of town rivals.
Produced by the Oxford Institute of Retail Management and the Building
Design Partnership, a firm of planners and architects, it also stresses the
need for more research into the social, environmental and trade implications
of the big new retail centres spawned by the spending boom of the 1980s.
The report is part of a DoE review of the government's retail planning
guidance to local authorities issued four years ago. A consultation paper on
new guidelines will be issued in the summer.
Mr Ross Davis, institute director, said a survey of retailers by the Oxford
Retail Group, a think-tank of 14 big retailers, developers, estate agents
and funding institutions, showed strong concern that present guidelines
tended, partly through lack of clarity, to encourage out of town retailing.
'Their view was that the swing of the pendulum had gone too far,' he said.
The Oxford Retail Group, of which he is secretary, believes the DoE is
coming round to that view, he said.
Concern is directed particularly at the new 'regional' out of town shopping
centres; the 'big four', all opened since the mid-1980s, are the MetroCentre
in Gateshead, Meadowhall near Sheffield, Merry Hill, west of Birmingham, and
Lakeside, Essex.
Research by Boots, one of the think-tank's members, indicates such centres
are significantly harming the performance of its nearby stores.
Its shops near Lakeside have suffered a drop in trade almost exactly equal
to that recorded by the Boots store in the new centre, opened in late 1990.
In Tyneside, Boots blames the impact of the MetroCentre, where it also
trades, for depressing the performance of its large branch in Newcastle's
Eldon Square, the MetroCentre's biggest rival.
Of Boots' 42 largest UK stores, Newcastle ranked fortieth in terms of
accumulated real sales growth in the four years from 1986, when the
MetroCentre's first phase opened. 'The impact of the MetroCentre was not as
great as first feared but it has been sustained,' said Mr David Stathers,
estates director for Boots the Chemist. 'These centres can only survive by
cannibalising others.'
Mr Stathers said Boots was monitoring its Eldon Square store's 'quite
worrying' relative lack of growth. Boots was also concerned, he said, at the
implications for centres such as Newcastle of the pull exercised by out of
town complexes on more affluent shoppers.
Researchers at the institute, part of Templeton College, the university's
management studies centre, have monitored since 1986 the MetroCentre,
Europe's largest out of town shopping and leisure complex, which has three
miles of malls and as much retail space as Romford or Oxford.
As it was the first of the 'big four' to open and has been trading at its
2.2m sq ft size for two years, they believe it offers clues to such centres'
performance and impact generally. 'It has been very successful  - and it has
some problems,' said retail research fellow Elizabeth Howard.
Last year the MetroCentre attracted 26m visitors; turnover of its 340 shops,
35 trading barrows and leisure facilities was Pounds 550m. Mr John Bryson,
MetroCentre manager, said its trade - 84 per cent of which comes from people
living within 30 minutes' road travelling distance - reflected its success
in tapping 'suppressed consumer demand'.
Mrs Howard said it had clearly generated consumer enthusiasm. But, she said,
its impact on older retail centres was not being faced up to.
Within the MetroCentre, there is also divergence between the performance of
the big multiples, with well located units, and that of many small traders
whose little shops are in fringe areas. While the MetroCentre's managers
reported a record Christmas for visitors, many small traders were
disappointed and some have pulled out.
Discontent is strongest in the 'themed' Mediterranean Village. 'It's pretty
desolate; we aren't getting the trade going past the door,' said Mr Howard
Robson, joint proprietor of children's wear shop Peek a Boo, near six empty
units. 'The rents are too high. People can't pay them.'
Mr Martin Glendavison, of Chestertons, letting agent for the MetroCentre's
owner, the Church Commissioners, confirms that while trade has been very
good for those in the main malls, small traders say life has been 'extremely
tough'. He said: 'We're prepared to be more flexible in the terms we offer
to tenants in the Mediterranean Village.'
The ending in August of the rates-free Enterprise Zone and the imposition of
high uniform business rates is another headache for small traders.
Mr Bryson said there was a high percentage failure rate among the
MetroCentre's small traders; he blamed it on inexperience and choice of
product lines. But the institute believes it indicates more general problems
for small traders in such centres.
The MetroCentre, suggests Mrs Howard, is too big. 'It just grew like Topsy.'

FT  29 FEB 92 / Budget '92: Complicated courtship rituals for a mythical
creature - The options open to a government set on wooing the 'female vote'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'female vote', that arguably mythical creature, could well find herself
courted in the Budget. Of the possible tokens of esteem available to Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, a measure to ease childcare costs is the most
likely to be deployed.
The Labour party earlier this month launched a glossy magazine aimed at
women. It also pledged to ensure local councils did not underspend on
provision for under-fives in order to keep poll tax bills down. This would
create, they said, an additional 23,000 nursery places at no cost to the
government.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has said he believes the
votes of women may determine the outcome of the general election and his
party has backed the idea of childcare vouchers for use in private, state or
workplace nurseries.
The Conservatives will not want to be left behind. The female vote as a
distinct group may not actually exist - a position argued by Dr Anthony
Heath, fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, and an expert in voting patterns
 -but what matters is that it continues to exist in politicians' minds.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, set a women-friendly tone in October at
the launch of Opportunity 2000, the business initiative to improve the
position of women in the workforce. It would be entirely consistent for Mr
Lamont to translate those words into actions.
Mrs Angela Rumbold, the Home Office minister who chairs the ministerial
group on women's issues, says she has 'put in quite a lot of ideas to the
Treasury' on childcare. A particular interest is the stimulation of
after-school and holiday provision. 'There's no doubt about it, there is a
requirement on the part of the woman who goes to work for help with
childcare,' she says.
The government is aware of criticism that public support for childcare in
Britain is among the lowest in the European Community. It has made clear
that it does not favour a monolithic approach to state provision but wishes
to stimulate private - and in particular employer-led - efforts.
There are a number of Budget measures that could be taken to fit this
approach, the most sweeping of which would be tax relief for parents on
childcare costs. This approach is favoured by, for example, National
Westminster Bank, which has called for an extended tax framework so working
parents can claim the costs of registered childcare as a legitimate business
expense.
Ms Ann Rennie, NatWest's head of equal opportunities, acknowledges that the
deadweight costs of tax relief on childcare could be about Pounds 200m a
year, but considers that 'much of this could be offset by additional revenue
generated from more women returning to work'. Some estimates put the costs
in forgone tax revenue at up to Pounds 500m.
Opponents of tax relief for childcare argue that it is potentially expensive
for the public purse and would disproportionately favour the higher-earning
nanny-employing classes. Top-rate taxpayers would receive the largest
handouts - an unappealing proposition financially and politically at a time
when the Conservatives will not want to be open to accusations of favouring
their friends.
Far more likely as a Budget measure is the widening of existing tax
exemptions on childcare subsidies provided by employers. This would be
modest in its costs and, for the government, the positive publicity could
equal that which would be generated by more expensive schemes.
The principle of childcare tax exemptions has already been conceded. In the
1990 Budget Mr Major, then chancellor, changed the rules so that subsidies
provided by employers on workplace nurseries and play schemes no longer
counted as a taxable benefit in kind.
However, the definition of 'workplace' was narrow, with exemptions
restricted to registered premises provided by the employer or those which
the employer had a direct hand in running. This definition has given rise to
many anomalies, says Working for Childcare, a campaign group.
Most important, the current rules specifically exclude childcare in a
domestic setting and do not take in childminding schemes or the vouchers for
childcare provided by some employers. These exclusions are unfair, it is
argued: not every parent wants to drag a baby into, for example, a
city-centre workplace nursery; nor may it be practical for small businesses
or organisations with widely dispersed workforces to set up nurseries.
The campaign for Tax Relief and Childcare (Trac), set up after the 1990
Budget to press for exemptions for all forms of registered childcare, argues
the costs of further reforms would be small. Based on the tax currently paid
by parents who are receiving childcare subsidies from their employers, Trac
claims the cost would be just Pounds 1.7m a year. Current tax exemptions on
workplace nurseries cost Pounds 3.3m a year, says the group.
Working for Childcare estimates that extending tax exemptions to all forms
of employer-sponsored childcare would cost around Pounds 10m this year. Mrs
Rumbold is less optimistic: 'There's probably another nought somewhere round
there.'
Trac sets great store by the female vote, quoting a Gallup opinion poll: in
July 62 per cent of women either agreed or strongly agreed they would 'vote
for a different party if they did more to assist with the provision of
childcare for women at work'.
Even if Dr Heath is right and the female vote is a chimera, childcare could
still be a vote-winner. Men may be parents, too, Dr Heath points out -
Budget childcare measures could have a general appeal and may, he agrees,
serve to soften the government's image.

FT  29 FEB 92 / TGWU starts ban on overtime at Vauxhall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS OF the TGWU general workers' union at Vauxhall, the General Motors
subsidiary, began an overtime ban yesterday in an effort to persuade the
company to improve a pay offer.
Other unions - including the AEU engineering workers' organisation - are
expected to order members to refuse overtime work within the next few days.
The Vauxhall offer to 9,000 manual workers would provide 5 per cent rises
from October last year and an increase in line with inflation from this
October, plus a single unconsolidated payment of 0.5 per cent of salary.
Employees at the Luton car assembly and parts plants would receive an extra
5 per cent on meeting demands for changes in work practices and bargaining
procedures.
The unions are angry that Vauxhall has refused to concede a reduction in the
39-hour week. They say the proposed deal is worth less than that won
recently by Ford workers.

FT  29 FEB 92 / All work and no pay for many on leap day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLAME IT on Christopher Clavius. But for the 16th-century astronomer,
salaried people would not have to work a day extra for nothing this year.
Clavius, astronomer to Pope Gregory XIII, invented the Gregorian calendar
which added a 29th day to February every fourth year.
While today's date means that employers of salaried staff will benefit from
an extra day's work at no cost, those paid weekly can expect to receive a
day's extra pay this leap year.
The extra day's production is expected to bring a rise in gross domestic
product of at least 0.3 per cent. The Central Statistical Office said,
though, that much of the leap-year effect would be smoothed out by seasonal
adjustments.
Annual season tickets for public transport come this year with an extra day
free, but buyers of weekly tickets will pay for the leap day. Monthly passes
tend to cost the same for a calendar month no matter how many days are in
it.
The same applies to anyone paying rent by the calendar month. Homebuyers
will find their monthly mortgage payment the same as ever - most building
societies divide the annual interest payment into 12 equal instalments.
Savers may think they are getting a good deal if interest is credited daily.
But banks and building societies have thought of that, and calculate rates
so that the annual total remains the same.
Travel companies have tried to exploit the leap-year tradition of women
proposing marriage on February 29 by offering special romantic breaks.
FT readers canny enough to have bought an annual subscription will receive
this issue gratis.
Meanwhile Oxfam, the overseas-aid charity, is asking people to use the extra
time given by the leap day to help raise money for charity, with events such
as a leapfrog human draughts match in Covent Garden, London.

LEADERS of the GPMU print union yesterday recommended a deal which they say
would raise pay in line with inflation.
The proposed agreement with the British Printing Industries Federation would
increase craft rates by Pounds 4.45 a week on April 24 and Pounds 2.50 from
from August 24.
The federation, which represents 3,000 employers with a total of 50,000
workers, had originally pressed for a delay. The union opposed that and
proposals for more flexible working.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Ucatt unveils survival package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UCATT, the construction union, yesterday unveiled a package of
organisational changes and a recruitment drive in an attempt to remain an
independent union, Catherine Milton writes.
The survival package, which the union's officials are considering at a
conference this weekend, includes a move to appoint officials instead of
electing them.
If the change is approved the only large union left electing officers will
be the AEU engineering workers' organisation.
In the past year Ucatt has been dogged by allegations of ballot-rigging. Mr
Albert Williams, the union's former general secretary, was suspended and
reinstated and finally took early retirement. About a dozen officials have
resigned.
Mr George Brumwell, who became general secretary last week, said: 'We have
survived this onslaught and I am confident that Ucatt can now begin to grow
again.'
Mr Brumwell said he aimed to keep the union independent, but did not rule
out a merger as long as it was dictated by industrial logic rather than
political or financial expediency.
Ucatt has been been badly affected by the loss of construction workers' jobs
in the recession. It has run a deficit for several years and believes the
deficit for last year will be about Pounds 1.2m. The union's membership has
fallen from 240,000 to 203,000 during the recession.
Most officials are elected by local branches. The union said this gives a
small number of branch secretaries disproportionate influence and the system
is open to abuse.

FT  29 FEB 92 / 'Category killer' strikes in Toyland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOYS 'R' US, the chain based in the US, has seized 18 per cent of the UK toy
market in just seven years, according to a report, John Thornhill writes.
Its performance highlights the impact of 'category killers' on retail
markets.
'Category killers' are highly efficient distribution channels which sell a
wide range of goods at discounted prices from low-cost edge-of-town
superstores.
Corporate Intelligence Group, a retail research company, found that Toys 'R'
Us, which opened its first UK store in 1985, is the clear leader in the
Pounds 990m toy market. Argos, the catalogue showroom retailer, is second
with 14 per cent of the market followed by Woolworth, owned by Kingfisher,
with 13 per cent.
Other retail sectors appear vulnerable to such forms of competition. Ikea,
the Swedish furniture group, has opened three big outlets in the UK and has
slow but steady expansion plans.
Nevada Bob, a US golf equipment retailer which runs six superstores in the
UK, plans to open more than 40 further stores by 1995 with the aim of
capturing 12 per cent to 15 per cent of the Pounds 500m market.
Mr Robert Clark, director of Corporate Intelligence, said US 'category
killers' succeeded because of the strength of their determination to win
customers. 'They have a huge domestic market where they are first able to
perfect their technique and build up sufficient financial strength to move
across borders.'
The report suggests that Toys 'R' Us will command more than 20 per cent of
the UK toy market by the end of this year. The success of Toys 'R' Us plus
the recession have led to the demise of a string of smaller toy retailers,
the report adds.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Treasury sees German 'constraint' on loan rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY has rejected suggestions that a drop in the value of sterling
or the pound's withdrawal from the European Monetary System would result in
lower UK interest rates.
It also indicates in the latest issue of the Treasury Bulletin that there is
little chance of UK interest rates falling below German levels in the
foreseeable future.
Mr John Maples, economic secretary to the Treasury, said when launching the
bulletin that the level of German rates was a 'real constraint' on British
interest rates. He added that there was 'really no escape from that
(constraint)' - although he refused to be drawn on the implications for UK
base rates. The Bank of England has been resisting market pressure for a cut
from the current 10.5 per cent before the March 10 Budget.
The Treasury's comments in the bulletin are clearly intended to counter
critics of government policy such as Sir Alan Walters, who served as
economic adviser to Mrs Margaret Thatcher during her premiership. They have
argued that devaluation of sterling in the exchange rate mechanism of the
EMS, or withdrawal from the system, would enable the government to cut
rates.
The Treasury says a significantly lower exchange rate over the past year -
either inside or outside the ERM - would 'probably have meant less inflation
convergence and higher UK nominal rates'. A fall in sterling's exchange rate
would be 'bound to add to UK inflation', it says, and 'lead to higher rather
than lower nominal UK rates'.
Drawing on a study of German and UK interest rates and the exchange rate of
the pound against the D-mark since 1979, it describes the present narrow gap
of less than 1 percentage point between UK and German short-term rates as 'a
rare event'. It says there has been only one very brief period - in 1981 -
when UK short-term rates were lower than German rates. That was after two
years when sterling had unexpectedly been very strong.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Ford set to lose leading share of new-car market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD is expected to have been ousted as leader in the UK market for new cars
by Vauxhall this month - the first time it has failed to lead the market on
a monthly basis since the mid 1970s.
Meanwhile, UK sales of new cars have fallen sharply in February, partly
because buyers have delayed purchases in the hope of a cut in car tax in the
Budget on March 10.
Ford said yesterday that it had orders for 6,300 vehicles on hold until
after the Budget. It claimed that the retail market for private buyers had
'died' during the final days of February.
Both Ford and Vauxhall forecast that official figures to be released next
week would show sales of new cars for the month down to about 105,000 - a 15
per cent drop from the 124,342 in February last year and a 44.7 per cent
decline from record sales of 189,850 in February 1989.
In the face of one of the steepest declines in car sales in the post-war
period, the motor industry has been campaigning fiercely for the government
to cut or remove the 10 per cent special car tax.
This tax is levied in addition to the 17.5 per cent value added tax and is
responsible for pushing UK car taxation well above rates in Continental
markets such as Germany and France.
Ford said yesterday that orders for as many as 20,000 vehicles could be on
hold in the whole motor industry pending the outcome of the Budget. It
expected sales to strengthen in the second half of next month.
The level of demand declined this month, with year-on-year sales 9 per cent
lower after 10 days, 12 per cent lower after 20 days and an expected decline
of 15 per cent for the full month.
Ford has held the leadership of the UK market for new cars on an annual
basis since 1977, when it ousted British Leyland (now Rover).
With four selling days uncounted, Vauxhall had captured 20.5 per cent of
sales, with Ford slipping back to second place on 17 per cent and Rover on
16 per cent. Ford is expected to hold its leadership with January and
February sales combined.
Ford insisted yesterday that it had not taken measures to boost its market
share artificially in the final days of the month.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Tories distance post-election plan from Thatcherism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BLUEPRINT for a new Tory government was discreetly unveiled in
Conservative Central Office yesterday with the publication of a pamphlet
certain to be seen as close to heresy by the party's hard right.
The 19-page document, One Nation 2000, is said in a foreword by Mr David
Howell, the former energy secretary, to offer the Tories 'a guiding theme'
for years leading to the millennium.
Yet its message carries both implicit and explicit criticisms of social
developments over the past decade, arguing strongly for government action to
shape a better integrated and less divisive model for society.
Taking care to praise the achievements of the Thatcher years, it goes on to
warn that 'something more is needed on which to build the policies of the
1990s'.
The precise wording of the paper has been approved by Mr John Major's aides,
while its sentiments have been enthusiastically endorsed by Mr Chris Patten,
party chairman.
Authorisation of the pamphlet's release so close to a general election will
come as a further signal to the Thatcherite right that the party leadership
supports a fundamental shift back towards more consensus politics.
The One Nation group, founded in 1950 to lobby for the Disraelian vision of
a truly national and classless Conservatism, comprises 33 backbenchers and
24 ministers who are not active members. Those include seven cabinet members
such as Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, education
secretary.
The pamphlet presents a conception of government's function redolent of the
Toryism of Mr Edward Heath or Mr Harold Macmillan.
In particular, the paper notes that a weakening social structure has put
'fearsome challenges to the cohesion of society' on the political agenda.
The paper warns that disillusioned youth culture and the disintegration of
family stability creates the danger that society might turn repressive.
'The guiding principle for the next decade must be to create a sense of
national unity which is vigorous enough to resist the drift to anarchy on
the one hand, and the predations of selfish libertarianism on the other,' it
says.
On specific issues, it implicitly warns against too big a tax cut in the
Budget by arguing that the scope for big extra current spending is 'very
limited'.
It suggests action to reform divorce law in favour of the parent left with
children, a temporary employment scheme for young people in government
service, more socially responsible corporate governance and tax breaks for
the self-employed.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Taxation shake-up urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SIMPLIFICATION of capital gains tax, a reform of advance corporation tax
and the streamlining of the tax system's administration was urged by the
Institute of Taxation yesterday.
The shift to 'self-assessment' of tax, which places far greater
responsibility on companies and individuals, will demand considerable change
over the next five years, the tax practitioners' think-tank argued in a
wide-ranging submission to the government.
Capital gains tax should be abolished, or taxpayers at least allowed to
defer payments on gains reinvested in assets or other qualifying deposits,
it said. Taxpayers should have to deal with only one tax office and complete
a single statement of taxable income and tax to be paid.
Companies should be able to offset against tax any expenditure incurred in
generating profits, including the costs of raising equity and other
financing costs, it said, while more generous relief should be allowed for
losses incurred.
Advance corporation tax - payments that cannot be offset against mainstream
corporation tax liabilities - is in need of reform, it argued. There should
be some form of exemption for the distribution of fully taxed overseas
profits.
There should also be greater consistency in the treatment of relief on
employees' expenses, the institute argued.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Lloyd's tragedy looks likely to run and run: Outline of the
plot at the troubled insurance market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACT ONE of the drama now playing at the Lloyd's of London insurance market
contained three extraordinary scenes.
Staged in dingy corners of Westminster, they transformed a private vendetta
by hard-hit Names - the individuals whose assets support the market's
underwriting - into a public row.
They forced the insurance market's authorities on to the defensive - it
could even be argued that last week's appointment of Sir David Walker,
chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, to direct investigations
into alleged malpractice flowed directly from them.
The Ambush
Mr David Coleridge, the Lloyd's chairman, might have been forgiven for
anticipating a gentle ride on February 11 at a 5pm appointment with Tory
backbenchers at Westminster.
True, the Pounds 116m settlement in the Outhwaite case - the biggest of a
number of Lloyd's-related legal actions - would figure prominently in the
next morning's headlines. But the second Guinness trial had just collapsed
and Mr Peter Clowes had been jailed for 10 years so City-minded MPs might be
expected to be preoccupied with other concerns.
In any case, Lloyd's has traditionally enjoyed a cosy relationship with the
Conservative party - nearly 60 Tory MPs, including ministers such as Mr Ian
Lang, Mr Archie Hamilton and Mr John Wakeham, are Lloyd's members.
Before the recent run of bad years MPs, like other well-to-do individuals,
were attracted by the opportunity to make their capital work twice:
investing it in orthodox fashion while at the same time committing it to
Lloyd's to support underwriting. Of course, Names were solemnly warned that
their liability was unlimited. But in the good years the prospect of penury
must have seemed remote. The implication was that 'the moon will turn to
blue cheese before you get a cash call', according to Mr Winston Churchill,
a Conservative MP who became a Name in the 1970s.
As 40 or so MPs assembled for the February 11 meeting in a Commons committee
room, they were surprised to be handed a sheaf of 14 detailed and aggressive
questions on the workings of Lloyd's, backed by a welter of supporting
evidence.
They included queries about why 'disastrously bad syndicates' were composed
'almost entirely of external or retired members' and why Lloyd's allowed
'excessive recruitment' of small investors with 'assets of only a bank
guarantee of Pounds 100,000 on their house'.
The dossier - the work of a prominent figure in one of the action groups
representing the Names who face cash calls following losses on a number of
syndicates - had a sting in the tail. Question 14 read: 'Is there not a
structural rottenness over the conflicts of interest of the regulators
within Lloyd's, which can only be met by outside regulation under the
Financial Services Act?'
According to one MP and Name who was present, those sitting within earshot
were 'absolutely stunned by the questions and the detail backing them up'.
Mr Coleridge 'practically had apoplexy' when he looked through them.
The near-universal reaction among MPs was that the chairman's attempts to
deal with the points raised was inept and unsatisfactory.
'We have seen Mr Coleridge on two occasions and found him to be very
unconvincing,' said Mr Spencer Batiste, the Tory MP for Elmet and a Name.
His 'lack of certainty or positiveness in addressing those questions' left
'a considerable feeling of unease', another MP and Name said .
One upshot of the meeting appears to have been to encourage a small number
of MPs to throw caution to the wind and seek a wider airing for their
grievances.
The Drop
The following afternoon Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, the Labour MP for
Workington who is known as a tenacious advocate of City reform, received a
telephone call from a Tory MP he refuses to name, inviting him to a
pre-arranged parliamentary visit to Lloyd's on February 17.
Mr Campbell-Savours was due in hospital and suggested that the Tory MP
approach Mr for Hackney South and Shoreditch. He asked for briefing notes,
which arrived in the form of the questions put to Mr Coleridge the previous
evening.
Contact with Mr Sedgemore was made while the barrister was beavering away in
the splendour of the Commons library. A pair of Tories approached, picking
their way between the leather armchairs, and regaled their political
opponent with details of their disillusionment with Lloyd's.
About an hour later, a copy of the questions which had so discomfited the
Lloyd's chairman appeared in Mr Sedgemore's Commons pigeonhole.
The matter nearly died there and then - the former television presenter, who
lists 'sleeping on the grass' as his Who's Who recreation, glanced at the
papers and consigned them to the wastepaper basket. But a chance encounter
led him to have second thoughts and he retrieved them.
If he had not done so, the allegations of malpractice may not have entered
the public domain the following day and Sir David Walker may not have been
asked to direct the investigations. Once the potential was realised, the
questions were plundered as the basis for a series of early-day motions on
the Commons order paper for February 13. At this point, the charges were
publicly available and had the protection of parliamentary privilege.
Some Tories are prepared to condone publicly this method of bringing the
allegations into the open. 'I think what the Labour MPs did was good,' says
Mr Paul Marland, the MP for Gloucestershire West, who is one of 3,000
members of Gooda Walker syndicates to have received cash calls.
The Lesson
'Tories declare war on Lloyd's' screamed the headline of the newspaper
sitting on corporate affairs minister Mr John Redwood's desk as an Exmoor
farmer walked into his office with a handful of other Lloyd's Names. It was
11am on February 13, the second visit in 15 days for the farmer - whose
Lloyd's losses had put him in fear of having to sell land which had been in
his family for 'very roughly 800 years'.
On his first visit, the farmer - referred to as 'deep throat' by Mr Marland
 -had presented the minister with a detailed exposition of the ways he
believed the Lloyd's market was vulnerable to malpractice.
With the aid of research accumulated over months, he set out to initiate Mr
Redwood in the mysteries of 'churning' and the 'LMX spiral'. He says the
alleged malpractice at Lloyd's would be 'quickly exposed if it took place at
my local sheep market because it would be too simple'. He says Mr Redwood
told him on February 13 that his first visit had been the first time the
minister had been told of alleged misdeeds in the market.
One cannot be sure how important a factor in subsequent developments this
teach-in will be. The Department of Trade and Industry denies putting
pressure on Lloyd's, which does not fall within its jurisdiction.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Stock exchange chief calls for end to 'soft commissions'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Rawlins, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, yesterday
urged stockbrokers to end voluntarily the controversial practice of charging
'soft commissions' through which charges on share deals are partially
rebated to fund managers in the form of services.
'If people want a service, they should be prepared to pay for it visibly in
a currency everyone understands,' Mr Rawlins said. 'Why do we need some
indirect form of remuneration?'
He told the NAPF conference that practitioner-regulators had to counter the
perception that they were 'tied up in their own vested interests'.
He said the present array of financial regulators should be replaced by
three, in 'a rigorous and rapid rationalisation of regulatory bodies'.
The Securities and Investments Board should continue as before. There should
also be two self-regulating organisations, one covering professional
practitioners in the wholesale markets, the other covering those selling
products to the public.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Pension funds boost voting power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the National Association of Pension Funds will this weekend
receive notice of the setting up of a scheme to help funds use their votes
when public companies ask their shareholders to approve important proposals.
The proxy early-warning service announced yesterday at the NAPF's annual
investment conference in Eastbourne will form part of the association's
campaign to encourage member funds to vote regularly. There is a particular
need in the short run to help companies to pass measures enabling them to
move on to the London Stock Exchange's new Taurus electronic settlement
system.
It is intended to start the scheme within the next few weeks in order that
the forthcoming round of end-1991 annual reports and resolutions at annual
meetings can be covered. The scheme, initially covering only the biggest 125
companies, could eventually include all 650-odd constituents of the
FT-Actuaries All-Share Index.
Mr Angus Matheson, newly appointed chairman of the NAPF's investment
committee, also foreshadowed several other initiatives at the annual
investment conference in Eastbourne.
He announced that Mr David Adams of the British Rail pension fund is to head
a monitoring group which will check that investment managers are complying
with a new code on the advertising of investment performance. The group
would also propose changes to the code where necessary.
Mr Matheson disclosed that the investment committee would soon reopen the
controversy over guidelines for share-option schemes by issuing a
consultative document. It would represent, he said, a search for a 'credible
consensus'.
He also described plans for a working party to investigate the sometimes
confusing ways in which fund management firms impose charges on their
pension fund clients.
The proxy warning arrangement, said Mr Matheson, was intended to be useful
not only to pension funds but also to companies concerned that they might
not be able to achieve a quorum.
The working party on remuneration is expected to study existing practices
and recommend ways of improving transparency of charging. It hopes that it
will be able to report later this year.
Pension funds have for some years been complaining about hidden or 'dirty'
charging methods through which basic fees are substantially increased, for
instance by means of charges for in-house unit trusts and extra commissions
for overseas transactions.
Mr Brian MacMahon, NAPF chairman, yesterday attacked the government for its
moves to add a 1 per cent age-related rebate to those aged over 30 who are
contracted out of the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme through a
personal pension.
'This is not the level playing field which the government advocates,' he
said.
'There appears to be a definite and unjustifiable tilt in favour of personal
pensions.'

FT  29 FEB 92 / Union may win Pounds 400,000 costs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TGWU general workers' union, which had a deficit of nearly Pounds 12m
last year, is likely to recoup about Pounds 400,000 of its costs from the
long-running industrial tribunal which found that 19 Tilbury dockers had
been unfairly dismissed.
The Port of London Authority sacked the dockers and contested their claim
for unfair dismissal. Unusually for such a case, the tribunal has ordered
the authority to pay 40 per cent of the union's costs. The authority already
faces a separate bill of about Pounds 750,000 for compensation to the sacked
dockers unless it wins its appeal against the decision.
The TGWU's legal costs have soared in recent years from a total of Pounds
1.75m in 1987 to Pounds 4.94m in 1991.

<TEXT>
A GUIDE to environmental rights and responsibilities aimed at local
authorities, environmental pressure groups and the top 1,000 companies was
launched yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary,
Alison Smith writes.
The 32-page booklet, issued under the Citizen's Charter, covers subjects
such as litter, recycling, noise, planning and energy efficiency. It sets
out the rights of the individual, the organisations responsible for
different aspects of the environment and suggestions on what action can be
taken.
The government intends to build on the guide and work towards an
environmental charter or series of charters later this year.
Mr Heseltine planted a weeping birch tree in Westonbirt, Gloucestershire, to
mark the guide's publication. He hoped the guide would start a debate on how
environmental rights and services could be extended and improved, and linked
it with the preparatory work on the Earth Summit in Brazil in June.
He said: 'We are looking for a short, incisive and accessible charter that
is consistent with the language of existing conventions, charters and
declarations.'

FT  29 FEB 92 / UN plans for W Sahara 'in jeopardy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS plans to bring peace to the former Spanish colony of the
Western Sahara are 'in serious jeopardy', according to a report to the US
Senate Foreign Affairs Committee.
The report, prepared by Mr George Pickart, staff member of the committee,
claims the UN Mission for Referendum in Western Sahara (Minurso), which is
supposed to oversee a referendum on the future of the territory in the
autumn, is suffering from the 'lack of political support from the UN
hierarchy in New York'.
This, it says, is demonstrated by 'the UN's repeated refusal to provide even
limited logistical support to the military observers in the field' and its
refusal to respond politically to reports of ceasefire violations. This has
'undermined Minurso's credibility' with both protagonists - Morocco and the
Polisario Front.
This problem 'has been compounded by the government of Morocco's
unwillingness to co-operate with Minurso's operations'.
Polisario, which at first chose to co-operate fully with Minurso has, in the
past two months, been increasingly unwilling to co-operate.
Allegations of irregularities in the mangement of Minurso's budget
procedures are further compounding an already difficult situation.
The report, being debated by the committee yesterday, argues that the
Moroccan authorities had delayed delivery of crucial supplies of
communications and sanitation equipment to Minurso.

Mr Richard Hu, finance minister, said in his annual budget that economic
growth should be between 4 and 6 per cent in 1992 rather than the previous
estimate of 5 to 7 per cent, because of less buoyant external demand.
In 1991, growth slowed to 6.7 per cent from 8.3 per cent in 1990.

ITALY has tightened its immigration laws, making it easier for the
authorities to expel illegal immigrants.
A decree approved by cabinet this week permits immediate expulsion of
illegal immigrants and limits the scope of appeal for immigrants accused of
committing crimes.
The government has been obliged to tighten the laws, first introduced in
1990, because of the ease with which immigrants have been able to stay in
Italy.
It has been relatively easy for immigrants to contest and delay expulsion
orders through resort to regional appeal courts. At the end of December only
4,000 of the 23,000 expulsion orders had been carried out. This process will
be speeded up and resort to appeal limited.
Local authorities have lacked funds to repatriate illegal immigrants or
those with proper documents accused of crimes. Now, the government has
agreed to increase funds for local administrations to deal with immigration
problems from L30bn to L60bn (Pounds 27.7m) a year.

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOROCCO and the European Community last night pulled back from the brink of
a crisis, agreeing in last-minute talks in Rabat to extend a fishing pact.
The deal meant that 800 fishing vessels, mostly Spanish, could still fish in
Moroccan waters instead of pulling out by midnight last night.
Relations between Morocco and the EC ran into stormy weather after the
European Parliament voted down Ecu463m (Pounds 324m) in credit and aid under
a co-operation agreement, because of its human rights record.
Rabat responded by freezing the agreement with the EC and so jeopardising a
four-year fishing accord, which is vital to Spain's large fleet and due to
run out today.
As the fishing accord deadline neared, the EC ordered vessels in Moroccan
waters back to port from midnight.
But with both sides anxious to avoid a breach, a Brussels official - Mr
Manuel Marin, the EC commissioner for development and fisheries - flew to
Rabat yesterday evening for talks with cabinet ministers.
An EC spokesman in Brussels later announced: 'There's been an agreement to
prolong the deal for two months.'
There were indications of a change of heart in Rabat after EC foreign
ministers decided last week to explore a wider-ranging free trade agreement
with Morocco. The ministers are to discuss this possibility in Brussels on
Monday.
EC officials said the discussion would widen to examine similar agreements
with Morocco's neighbours, Algeria and Tunisia. What had seemed a tactical
ploy to mend diplomatic fences with Rabat could eventually widen into a
strategic aim to bind the Maghreb as a whole closer to the EC.
Morocco's creditor governments have agreed to allow the country to delay
payment on a large portion of its Dollars 22bn foreign debt, Reuter reports.
The agreement was reached at a meeting of the Paris Club of creditor
countries. Moroccan Finance Minister Mohammed Berrada said the agreement
allowed his country to reschedule Dollars 1.2bn.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS, the world's largest vehicle maker, yesterday signed a
memorandum of understanding with the Polish government and FSO, the Polish
state-owned car maker, for assembly of Opel cars in Warsaw, writes Kevin
Done.
Separately, Volkswagen and Toyota are negotiating with the Polish
authorities to set up a joint venture with FSR (Fabryka Samochodow
Rolniczych) for possible assembly of pick-up trucks in Poznan.
The GM agreement - an important step in modernisation of the Polish auto
industry - is the latest move in the company's ambitious expansion in
eastern Europe. This already includes the building of a DM1bn (Pounds 346m)
assembly plant at Eisenach in eastern Germany and a DM350m engine plant and
small volume car assembly plant in Hungary.
Under the accord, a joint venture will be set up with FSO in which the US
car maker will hold a large majority stake.
The new company would initially invest up to Dollars 75m in plant and
equipment at the antiquated FSO plant in Warsaw for production of the
Opel/Vauxhall Astra, GM's best-selling car in western Europe.
Mr Robert Eaton, president of GM Europe, said a final agreement should be
completed in 1-2 months.
GM is planning capacity to produce a total of 35,000 Astras a year on three
shifts, with initial output starting within 18 months of a final deal being
signed. GM and FSO are also negotiating a more ambitious second stage, which
could lead to development of a new integrated plant with capacity to produce
100,000-150,000 cars a year.
GM and FSO will form a joint study team to develop a replacement model for
FSO's existing, out-dated Polonez model, a hatchback derived from the Fiat
125.
In a more immediate step GM said it intended a technical assistance
agreement with FSO aimed at upgrading the current product and manufacturing
performance for the Polonez. FSO plans to produce 78,000 Polonez cars this
year.
GM will also seek to develop FSO components suppliers in co-operation with
its own wholly owned components subsidiaries and leading suppliers in
western Europe.
Volkswagen's negotiations in Poland are for a joint venture with FSR, the
small light commercial vehicle maker, to assemble the Toyota Hi-Lux pick-up,
which is currently assembled in small volumes under licence at VW's Hanover
commercial vehicles plant.
Last year VW assembled 12,017 of the pick-ups in Hanover of which 5,989 were
sold under the VW Taro badge and the rest under the Toyota badge.
It is understood VW and Toyota are considering a capacity of 20,000-30,000
for the pick-up venture in Poland.
The GM and VW projects are essential if they are to qualify for the
controversial 10,000-a-year quotas of duty-free car imports proposed by
Poland under its planned free trade pact with the European Community. Poland
is planning a 30,000-a-year quota of duty-free car imports to be split
equally between GM, VW and Fiat. The quotas are conditional on investment
contracts with Polish partners.

The enclave is administered by Azerbaijan but largely populated by

The order for the pull-out of the 366th motorised regiment follows the
deaths earlier this week of a handful of soldiers caught in the fighting
between Armenian guerrillas and Azerbaijani forces.
Fighting flared again yesterday in the capital Stepanakert, where the
regiment is based. Azerbaijani and Armenian officials claimed their civilian
targets were under particularly vicious attack.
Marshal Shaposhnikov, who is also commander-in-chief, has long warned that
he would withdraw troops rather than allow them to become targets of ethnic
conflicts in the former Soviet Union. No dates have been given for the
withdrawal.
Troops under fire along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border will also be
withdrawn. Commanders of the Trans-Caucasus military district, which
encompasses Georgia as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan, have been ordered to
rebuff attacks on military installations.
Azeri and Armenian officials say sophisticated weapons, including combat
helicopters, tanks and armoured personnel carriers, are being used by
guerrillas on both sides in the four-year-old conflict.
Armenian militants attacked the last Azeri stronghold in Nagorno-Karabakh
yesterday, according to Azerbaijan's interior ministry, which said residents
of the town of Shusha fled as helicopter gunships swooped down from
snow-covered mountains.
Armenians in the enclave want unification with Armenia, but Azerbaijan will
not give up any territory.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Bosnia holds crucial independence vote
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE central Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina will today hold a
crucial referendum on independence against a background of renewed efforts
by Serbia and Croatia to carve up this ethnically mixed republic.
The outcome of the referendum is likely to determine if Bosnia will slide
into instability just weeks before the expected deployment of UN troops in
neighbouring Croatia.
Efforts to partition the republic were held during a round of secret talks
in Graz, southern Austria last Wednesday between Mr Radovan Karadzic, head
of Bosnia's Serbs, and an envoy of President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia.
If Croatia and Serbia succeed in their goal, the Moslems of Bosnia, who make
up 43 per cent of the 4.3m population, would either be without a home, or
else would fight to prevent the break up of Bosnia.
Serbs make up 31 per cent of the population, followed by Croats, who make up
17 per cent.
Western diplomats in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, yesterday said they
feared the outbreak of bloodshed among the republic's closely intertwined
national communities.
'It means war if the Croats and Serbs actually try to divide the republic,'
said a diplomat.
But Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of Bosnia-Hercegovina, said
'there is no way secret plots can succeed. Democracy will win'.
Bosnia's Serb leaders have called for a boycott of the referendum on the
grounds that Serbs have already chosen to remain within a Yugoslav state,
and with Serbs from outside of Bosnia.
Mr Karadzic, who takes his instructions from Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the
president of Serbia, said: 'Serbs comprise the majority in 30 of the 109
counties (in Bosnia) ..We have already held our referendum.'
The referendum must gain 50 per cent approval in order to satisfy the
European Community requirements for recognition.
Fears that the republic could slide into ethnic violence were heightened by
reports of an explosion last Thursday which damaged a 450-year-old mosque in
Banja Luka, north west of Bosnia, where many Serbs live, and where Serbs
have declared a republic within a republic.
Explosions have have also taken place in Mostar, a predominantly Croat and
Moslem city, where much of the federal air force industry is based.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Pressure mounts on Lloyd's chief: Commons trade committee
chairman attacks credibility of insurance market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL PRESSURE on Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, intensified
yesterday when an influential Tory backbencher publicly attacked the
insurance market's credibility.
Lloyd's 'must get its act together on the world stage', said Mr Kenneth
Warren, chairman of the all-party Commons trade and industry select
committee.
'It must be seen to be taking every action possible to assure the world
investment market that it is determined to have feasible credibility and
capability,' he said.
His remarks come a week after Lloyd's appointed Sir David Walker, chairman
of the Securities and Investments Board, to investigate alleged malpractice.
Over the past month, MPs from both main parties have supported allegations
that market insiders have benefited, to the detriment of outside Names, by
making use of privileged information. Names are the individuals whose assets
provide the market's capital.
Mr Warren also released details of an exchange of letters between himself
and Mr Coleridge which, he said, left him 'deeply concerned'. The Lloyd's
chairman's reply, he said, 'does not convey to me the breadth and depth of
urgency which the problems of the Names demands.
'Indeed, the problem extends beyond the enormous losses suffered by many
outside who do not appear to have enjoyed the same stature as those inside
Lloyd's,' he added.
In a letter dated February 14 1992, Mr Warren expressed concern about the
relationship between Names, agents who handle their affairs and manage
syndicates, and underwriters. 'I would like to be assured that a
responsibility is placed on those who handle the commitments (of Names),' he
said.
'I would have expected that commitments would be required to be transparent
so that all who have a right to see what is going on can do so.'
In his response, dated February 21 1992, Mr Coleridge said Lloyd's did not
hold the data about transactions entered into on behalf of Names. Useful
information about the risks and commitments undertaken on behalf of Names
can only be provided by the managing agent of the syndicate. 'That agent
maintains all of the books and records in which those transactions are
recorded,' Mr Coleridge said.
This latest row will stir the already heated debate at Lloyd's about the
relation between the insurance market and parliament. Mr Robin Warrender,
chairman of London Wall Holdings, one of the largest agency groups at
Lloyd's, believes that 'relations are deplorable. Lloyd's just hasn't got
the right sort of parliamentary representation,' he said.
Lord Kimball, a former Lloyd's Council member, disagrees. 'Since 1982
Lloyd's has done an immense amount of bridge-building. It has introduced
itself to MPs of all parties. It is disappointing there has not been a
better payoff.'

FT  29 FEB 92 / UN warns Iraq on missile delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ was warned by the United Nations Security Council last night that it
must comply with orders to destroy materials used in its Scud-type missile
programme.
The tough UN admonition of Baghdad came after Iraq rejected a UN deadline to
begin destroying missile-related materials. Instead it called for further
talks with the UN on other uses for these materials.
The Iraqi attitude, widely seen as delaying tactics and a test of western
nerve, has again raised the prospect of punitive measures against President
Saddam Hussein.
The Security Council warned Iraq of the 'serious consequences' of continued
failure to comply with its orders. But in an apparent concession, the UN
also agreed to receive a high-level delegation being sent to New York by
Baghdad.
The elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was ordered in the UN
ceasefire resolution bringing an end to the Gulf war last year. Destruction
of missile-related equipment was to have started last Wednesday, but the
deadline was extended to last night.
In a written response to UN pressure for immediate co-operation, Iraq asked
to convert missile-related material for other uses. It could be used in
making liquid fuel tanks and to make explosives for road construction. It
could also be used in a shorter-range missile programme acceptable to the
UN.
Baghdad asked the UN to put off a final decision until an Iraqi delegation
goes to New York early in March. The delegation is expected to press for
economic sanctions, including the oil embargo, to be lifted, linking this
with the scrapping of weapons.
Mr Thomas Pickering, the US diplomat who is current president of the UN
Security Council, termed Iraq's reply as 'seven pages of No'.
Later, in a strongly worded statement on behalf of the 15 member nations of
the Security Council, he called on Iraq to co-operate with the UN weapons
inspectors now in Baghdad. It was up to these UN men alone to decide what
Iraqi weapons materials must be destroyed, he said.
Iraq was ordered immediately to carry out all its obligations under UN
resolutions and to communicate without further delay an authoritative,
unconditional acknowledgement of its agreement.

FT  29 FEB 92 / A deafening bang, silence then the screaming began
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ANDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of 28 people injured by yesterday morning's rush-hour bomb at London
Bridge station is lifted into an ambulance. The 2lb device went off in a
lavatory minutes after a coded warning that bombs had been left at
unspecified BR stations. The bombing, described by George Churchill-Coleman
of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch as a 'criminal and callous act
carried out by the Provisional IRA', closed mainline and Underground
stations for several hours. Four of the injured were seriously hurt.
IT WAS just another Friday morning. Up at 7am, blue pinstripe, red tie, pink
FT.
The 7.50 from Surbiton, via Wimbledon, Clapham Junction and Waterloo (six
minutes late into Waterloo after an unexplained halt). Fellow commuters
checked their watches and tut-tutted. Just another Friday morning.
Over the concourse to Waterloo East, I waited for the train from Charing
Cross, walked down the platform to avoid the crush of hardened travellers.
I stepped off the train almost opposite the gents' toilet on Platform 4 at
London Bridge, dawdling towards the exit.
There was a deafening bang about 30 ft away. Not a rumble, just a sharp,
brittle retort like a supercharged firecracker, and a gust of hot air
followed by the sound of glass falling. After the bang, the silence. Shocked
faces turned to where a plume of dirty grey smoke rose a few yards down the
platform. Three or four human forms lay huddled amid the dust and debris on
the platform's edge. And then the screaming started.
'A derailment,' I thought for a split second. Then: 'No, a bomb.' I checked
the station clock - 8:27:31. Precisely.
A middle-aged chap in a grey overcoat stood next to me, mouth agape. He
looked as though he might start crying. 'It's a bomb,' I told him,
confidently, and started walking back up the platform to the victims. An
afterthought checked me: there might be a second blast.
There was blood, mainly seeping from noses and ears, and from cuts caused by
flying glass. A black-coated man in his mid-forties held a handkerchief to
his nose. I took his arm, led him to a nearby seat and checked him over. No
cuts, nothing broken. 'It's probably the concussion from the blast,' I
improvised. 'You'll be OK.' He did not reply.
A train pulled in to Platform 4 on the Kent arrivals side. Several
passengers waved it through, but it stopped. Passengers leapt out, charged,
wavered, then broke ranks. Some stopped in shock. Many more walked straight
past. If the train had arrived 15 seconds earlier ..
Several people were still lying where they had fallen, surrounded now by
helpers - mainly women.
I patted a few backs and offered a few words of comfort. Some young girls
were still screaming. Otherwise the scene was strangely still, as if running
in slow motion.
The middle-aged chap in the grey coat caught up with me and grabbed my arm.
'Did you see it?' he gasped, his grip very tight. 'I'd just walked past
there. Jesus Christ. You passed me. I saw you. I'm going home. I'm going
home. Jesus Christ.'
Another businessman overheard us. 'What's the point?' he asked, bitterly,
waving his arms at no one in particular. 'What's the bloody point?'
We all knew what he was referring to. 'Bloody IRA,' he said. 'Bloody
pointless.' He stalked off, head held high. Urban Man, grim but undefeated.
Sirens wailed in the distance. The first blue ranks of police charged up the
platform, ordering people to clear the area. There was nothing more to do,
so we left.
The bombed platform and those next to it were sealed off. The main entrance
was blocked by commuters from other lines, some trying to leave, some trying
to get in. Few realised what had happened.
Outside, ranks of fire engines and police cars arrived. It was 8.36. A young
man carrying a sports bag surveyed the scene glumly. 'I've got to get over
the (London) Bridge,' he said. 'I'm not taking the Tube after this lot.
Where is bloody London Bridge, anyway?'
'You're almost standing on it,' I told him, pointing to the bridge a few
yards away where lines of City footsoldiers marched towards the Square Mile.
We laughed, nervously.
If it isn't staff shortages, it's snow; if it isn't snow it's leaves. And if
it isn't leaves, it's bombs. It was just another Friday morning.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Tories are 'borrowing to bribe' says Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK, Labour leader, last night sought to sharpen the choice
facing voters by contrasting Tory plans for 'borrowing to bribe' with
Labour's commitment to 'borrowing to build'.
His upbeat speech to the Welsh Labour conference in Swansea came as a poll
showed the two main parties neck and neck, appearing to confirm the shift
towards Labour in the past week or so. The same survey for Gallup in today's
Daily Telegraph, showed a continuing rise in support for the Liberal
Democrats.
The week has been dominated by growing expectations that Mr John Major will
use a tax-cutting Budget as the launchpad for an April election. That is
still the expectation, in spite of the poll which shows Conservative support
down two points at 37 per cent, half a point behind Labour on 37.5 per cent.
Last week's Gallup survey gave the Tories a two-point lead.
The Liberal Democrats will be buoyed by the one-point rise in their standing
which, at 20 per cent, is their best showing for several months.
'While the other two parties remain stuck in their slug-it-out battle, we
are beginning to reap the sustained benefits of a positive campaign based on
issues not insults,' Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, said.
Mr Kinnock told his audience that while Labour would invest for recovery the
Tories would try to save their skins with tax cuts. Budget income tax
reductions would be temporary, he warned, and would have to be paid back
through higher VAT and charges in health and education.
Mr Chris Patten, Tory party chairman, said Mr Kinnock's speech had failed to
answer the key economic questions. 'The advent of a Kinnock government would
be greeted with the popping of champagne corks in the headquarters of every
overseas company which competes with British firms in world markets,' he
said.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Hawks and Handsaws: The sands of time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM thinking small at present. Large matters like elections or what best to
do about mad bankers (shoot or drown them, I imagine) are way beyond my
grasp. The reason I am thinking small is that I have just read an essay
called The Ideal Particle and the Great Unconformity by Reg Saner which
appears in a book called The Best American Essays 1991, edited by Joyce
Carol Oates.
I bought it last week in Beverly Hills. It cost Dollars 9.95. If you can
name a better way to spend Dollars 9.95 in America at present, you are
welcome to write to me. Perhaps I will reply. But then, perhaps, I won't,
because I doubt I could be wrong.
The writers shepherded together by Ms Oates in her purple-coloured volume
include Woody Allen, Margaret Atwood, John Updike, Elizabeth Hardwick and
Stephen Jay Gould. But it is Reg Saner, a poet who teaches at the University
of Colorado, who takes the laurel wreath with his account of a descent of
the Grand Canyon.
As he goes along, he muses on various themes, some of them very large: the
age of the Earth and man's place in the universe; religious fundamentalism
and the Copernican revolution; how knowledge of geological time changes the
mind forever.
As Saner says, people come from far and wide to gaze into the Grand Canyon -
and tremble, for the canyon reflects back at us an image of ourselves as
creatures in transit: body hair once pelt; toenails once claws; vertebral
column adapted from our days as quadrupeds; hands that used to be forepaws;
brain on its way to being, perhaps, something better than a reservoir of
reptilian and mammalian cunning.
So why am I thinking small this week? The answer lies in the ideal particle
of Saner's essay's title. Suppose you wanted to envisage a blaze-blue
morning 200m years ago, and then a blaze-blue morning 200m summers up ahead.
How would you bring them together?
Saner does it by writing about the grains of quartz that make up much of the
sand in the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in southern Colorado and
elsewhere.
Such a grain is nearly indestructible. At some point, loose quartz grains
get cemented to fellow grains as sandstone. Provided the sandstone sinks no
deeper than six miles beneath the Earth's surface, it will, most probably,
rise again, and the grain will be rubbed free until recemented as one of the
countless trillions making up yet another sandstone.
In turn, the new layer will be overlaid by sedimentation and sink from view.
But then it will rise again, and the grains be granulated again, and set on
further travels, before the process starts once more.
'An individual quartz grain,' writes Saner, 'can be blown away, buried,
resurrected, and re-eroded good as new through unimaginable chunks of time.
The Harvard geologist Raymond Siever offers his 'rough guess' of about 200m
years per cycle. And how many cycles might an actual sand grain undergo?
Siever thinks a Devonian sand grain, for example, laid down maybe 380m years
back, could conceivably have circled through burial and resurrection ten
times since first being nicked off its parent granite some 2.4bn years ago.'
2.4bn? That is 5,000 times longer than the 500,000 years since man was
transformed from Homo erectus into Homo sapiens.
As you can imagine, Saner has no time whatsoever for Creationists, or
'natural theology', or 'scriptural geology' - any more than he could have
time for Baptist meteorology or Mormon physics. 'Every grain at the Dunes
(National Monument)', he says, 'is incomparably more ancient than the name
of any god, known or forgotten. The last grain among them will be
circulating here undiminished long after the last god is gone.'
Since returning from Beverly Hills, I have been unable to sleep. I find
concentration difficult. My appetite comes and goes. In traffic, I give very
iffy hand-signals. Perhaps it is only jet-lag. But I cannot banish from my
mind an image of those quartz grains tumbling and resurfacing, being
shifted, sifted, sorted, then tumbling and resurfacing again through
millions of years.
When I pick up a newspaper, I read of monstrous events in train. John Major
says this. Neil Kinnock claims the opposite. George Bush is in trouble,
which is where he deserves to be. ICI is not happy. Very few people are.
Russia is freeing prices, even that of vodka. The planet is dying of
drought. Elizabeth Taylor is 60. Fraud. Murder. Bombs. Virginia Bottomley
rampant. What to do with Lord King? And there is still an Archbishop of
Canterbury.
Monstrous happenings, to be sure. But all I can see is sand. I imagine I'll
snap out of it.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Heaven and Hell: Why there is no room for mice in Paradise -
The concept of Heaven from a feline perspective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR OUR two Burmese cats, Hell is 'Out' and Heaven is 'In'. For them, as
house cats, our spacious flat is the world. It contains all, or almost all,
they need or want: cupboards to vanish in, vases to knock over, an endless
supply of food and two human beings to be used as furniture or hot water
bottles when the occasion arises.
Until they were taken Out for the first (and so far only) time, they could
not have known that Heaven for them was In; but a brief foray in the garden
seems to have convinced them - if their apprehensive, then contemptuous,
sniffing and swift return to their basket is anything to go by - that the
comforts of In are hugely preferable to the unknown hazards of Out. They are
now in the enviable situation of being back in Heaven, and knowing it.
If it is true that there can be no good that Heaven lacks, our cats' world
lacks the perfection that is one of Heaven's traditional attributes. For
they cannot fulfil one of the deepest needs of their natures, which is to
hunt and kill.
We are told that in Paradise the lion will lie down with the lamb, so
presumably our cats will merely frolic with the mice and birds they now miss
stalking; but I cannot help feeling that this human Heaven does not answer
to our cats' heart's desire. It is here that we encounter the paradoxes that
swarm around the idea of Heaven, and make it an idea as elusive as the
infinite.
To start with, a feline Heaven will be Hell for mice: how then can they
share the same Paradise? Not only is the perfection of the feline Heaven
uncombinable with that of the (presumably tamer) mouse's Paradise - it
requires the mouse's damnation. This unfortunate result cannot be explained
by any moral turpitude on the part of the mouse. It is not as if, as in the
repellent Heaven of Thomas Aquinas, the beatitude of the saved is heightened
by the spectacle of the torments of the damned. It is simply that without
mice as prey, the feline Heaven seems less than perfect.
Reflecting on Heaven for a Burmese leads me to wonder if our ideas on the
subject are not, owing to the influence of Christianity, overly moralised.
In our official thinking we pay tribute to the notion, which in practice we
often ignore, that moral goods are more valuable than other goods - goods
such as beauty, pleasure or wealth. We do this, I suppose, because these
other goods come to us, if they come at all, as a matter of chance, whereas
moral goods - the virtues - are attainable by everyone by an exercise of
free will.
This Christian prejudice denies the fact that intelligence and stupidity,
imaginativeness and sensitivity, bravery and cowardice are as much
accidents, as much throws in the genetic lottery and products of good and
bad fortune in our lives, as are physical beauty or winning the pools.
That we are as we are is a matter of luck - a conclusion that would not have
surprised the pagan thinkers of Greek antiquity. But if this is so, are we
not unreasonable in insisting that ethical goods always outweigh non-moral
goods? After all, our actual behaviour hardly supports this heroic
assertion.
When we chose how to spend an evening, with earnest and morally impeccable
but boring friend or with a witty and engaging rascal, it is not always
virtue that tips the scales. Is it really reprehensible to prefer an
excellent meal with a bottle of fine wine and a charming companion to an
evening reading Kierkegaard over a glass of Perrier? If morality deserves
(and receives) a measure of demotion in our everyday lives, how much more so
in our musings about Heaven? Our religious traditions encourage us to think
of Heaven as the place where wrongs are righted, tears are dried, and the
mad injustice of the world is resolved into a peaceful harmony.
Certainly, this conventional idea satisfies our need for consolation. Yet,
as one grows older, it does so less and less. As our acquaintance with
sorrow and tragedy becomes all too familiar, the notion that great
misfortune has its place in the grand economy of things comes to disgust us.
Then theodicy - the project of resolving the problem of evil and so
justifying God's ways to man - starts to look like an enterprise in
thoroughly bad taste. How could justice in Heaven even begin to compensate
for lives ruined on Earth? Perhaps, then, we should empty Heaven of the
bric-a-brac of Christian morality, and instead think of it as a place where
all things are possible and all desires are satisfied.
Let the glutton be free to wallow in gluttony, let the rake have his fill of
concupiscence, let the miser revel in avarice and the predatory cat delight
in the torment of its prey, without their joy being overshadowed by
morality.
Such a Heaven would allow us to indulge aspects of our natures that are
contradictory: the pleasures of the debauchee, and the joys of the
anchorite, could coexist in the same soul without contradiction. A
conception of Heaven on these lines would admit that we need morality only
because of our poverty and frailty: like drainage systems, morality is
doubtless a necessary convenience, but it is not something that bears too
much thinking on, and it surely is not the supreme good of life.
Heaven, then, is abundance, a plethora of possibilities so
more-than-infinite that we need engage no more in the wearisome weighing of
costs and benefits, the calculation of duty and obligation, that is our
ordinary lot.
There is a problem, though, with this Heaven, as with any other that is
genuinely desirable - it must transcend not only the laws of ethics but
those of logic, too. The paradises of cats and mice are incompatible, and
can both be realised only if the law of non-contradiction - considered since
Aristotle the cornerstone of logic - is suspended.
For a few medieval theologians, this is not a problem, since the laws of
logic are only God's commands, and so can be waived at His will.
For us poor mortals, the problem with a Heaven that abounds in
contradictions is that it is inconceivable. This is to say that the very
idea of perfection eludes us: for human logic, it is incoherent. Since we
cannot even coherently imagine what Heaven could be like, the idea of it
evaporates in our minds, and we are left with the world as it is. But if we
have gone this far in our musings, there is a difference. If it is true that
the very idea of perfection is flawed, then we can no longer think of the
difficulties of our lives in terms of their departure from some ideal state.
If we indeed had a clear idea of perfection, and no less clear insight into
the contradictions of our natures, we would be forced to the conclusion
that, whereas there is truly an In, we are forever Out - which is Hell
indeed.
As it is, lacking any idea of perfection, we at least escape the sufferings
that arise from thinking that the flaws in our lives are in principle
removable. We end up neither In nor Out, but simply Here - wherever that may
be.

Beautiful People
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
I HAVE a recurring dream, perhaps a nightmare. I am a character in a
property magazine. The dreams started when we moved into an area deemed by
these magazines as suitable for dumping their glossy product. For some
reason I could not resist them. First, I read the soft core property
magazines, but now I read hard core, like Boardroom and London Portrait. And
then the dreams began. Sometimes they are in black and white, sometimes in
colour. In the colour dreams everyone seems much more affluent and people
never talk about the actual price of property. They come up to me and say
'Price on application, dear boy,' or, as we drink cocktails by the azure
indoor swimming pool, the man next to me says: 'Ah, hello. Offers invited,
offers invited.'
There are so many cocktail parties in these dreams that even in the black
and white ones, everyone seems happy and optimistic. There is a deafening
hubbub so that the same phrases always seem to catch my mind's ear, 'so much
pent up demand', 'prices have reached bottom', 'recovery in the spring'. The
nightmarish aspect is that I too seem to be unable to say anything which is
not effusive. All my critical faculties and judgment have been taken away
from me. I want to tell the truth, what I really feel, but I am capable only
of adjectival incontinence: 'stunning]' I exclaim. 'Stylish]' 'immaculate]'
'substantial]' 'delightful]'
There are some pleasant aspects to the dream. The restaurants are always
free, and the meals invariably delicious. There are health clubs on every
street corner, full of firm young bodies topped by faces which always look
thrilled to see me. Outside one of these health clubs I am offered a shining
new car. In the dream the cars are always shiny and new, unless they are
fabulously old and valuable. Once I saw someone getting into a car that I
particularly admired. I asked the man behind the wheel how much the car was
worth. 'Buy my outstanding seven bedroom, detached family house in the most
prestigious road in this up and coming area, and the car is yours', the man
shouted, waving the keys.
One of the most peculiar aspects of the dream is that although it is set in
an intensely urban environment, everyone I meet says they live in a
'village'. I meet people from Hampstead village, Kensington village, Notting
Hill village, even Brixton village. Sometimes I try to visit these people in
their villages, but they do not seem to exist in any map, or on any road
signs. But then I remember that I am in a dream and that anything is
possible, even Brixton village.
Towards the end of the dream I am accosted by all manner of strange and
sometimes unsavoury people, offering services which I never knew existed.
Most of them press on me cards with Harley Street addresses. A man comes up
to me claiming that he has made 'great advances in human sexuality
particularly' - and here he winks knowingly - 'the management of male
virility problems. Call me,' he murmurs. 'All treatment in strictest
confidence.' I smile and move on. Only to be pinned to the wall by a woman
of uncertain age. 'Lymphoedema,' she says, by way of introduction.
'Dominic,' I reply. 'No, cheeky,' she simpers, 'I am talking manual lymph
drainage and compression bandaging. Plus Frigi-seaweed, volcanic and marine
mud treatment. Call me.' I light a cigarette. Another woman appears. 'Stop
smoking in one hour]' she insists. 'Depression?' she goes on, 'addiction?
phobias? call me on this number.'
I begin to run but yet another strange saleswomen grabs me by the arm.
'Stress?' she yells, 'you need holistic health care, deep relaxation
therapy, and natural healing'. 'No I don't,' I yell back. 'I need to wake
up.'
Then I do wake up and find that I have fallen asleep over the classifieds in
London Portrait. I look up to see the familiar damp patch on the bedroom
ceiling, the cracked pane in the window. Through the wall I hear the
neighbours arguing. I turn to my left: 'Shall we invite offers for this
immaculate and peaceful semi-detached residence?'

FT  29 FEB 92 / Private View: Liberator of the inner voice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HUMAN voice is like a musical instrument which gives colour and sense to
words - when it is played well. Yet most of us in the developed world, it
seems, have forgotten how to play.
We spend a lot of time and money on our physical appearance: on our faces,
hair, our figures, clothing and deportment. This, we proclaim, is the sort
of person I am. Then we open our mouths and convey . . . nothing.
Why? Because the human voice is not only a speaking machine; it is also a
weapon of defence and of attack. Fear of ridicule and desire for respect
lead to muscular tension, poor breathing, strange postures and an unnatural
voice that betrays our real intent.
That, at least, is what Patsy Rodenburg says. She has some claim to speak.
She is head of voice training at the National Theatre and the Guildhall
School in London and gets rave reviews from actors and directors. She has
worked worldwide, studying not only actors but businessmen, barristers,
prisoners, politicians and chimpanzees (for the film Greystoke.).
I felt she was studying me. So I asked her, in a voice which sounded
suddenly not quite my own, how she could tell when a person was speaking
badly.
'You find yourself listening to the voice instead of listening to what they
say. Or they will complain of losing their voice, or that the voice is not
reflecting their thoughts and feelings.'
Rodenburg is the sort of person who gets no peace at parties. People confess
that they are ashamed of their voices, that they feel boring, cannot command
attention, are scared to speak in public, cannot express themselves. They
gravitate to her as if she were a psychiatrist - which, in a sense, she is.
'I can't deal with the psychological things,' she said. 'But I can deal with
the physical things which will often affect the psychology. The terrible
thing is that when you talk about somebody's voice, you're talking about
their whole being. The voice is actually the tip of the whole of you. That's
why, when people mimic you, even if it's kindly, it's painful.'
As small children, she said, we have naturally good posture, breathe easily
and speak out. But we soon develop bad habits. Boys learn macho postures,
girls begin to sag. 'Some women remember how they started to collapse
through the spine, crossing their arms to hide their breasts, for example.'
We develop vocal mannerisms. Little girls put on nice voices to wheedle
daddy; boys, seemingly under greater pressure to be clear and adult, may
begin to stammer. Four out of five stammerers are boys, according to US
research. Patsy Rodenburg herself had a slight speech impediment as a child.
'The muscles of speech are very complex and they have to be flexible, to
sort of dance. I don't think I spoke much and then when I did, I just
couldn't get the words out. So I was sent to an elocution teacher. I'm glad
I did it, but I hated it.
'But at least it's given me a perspective on how I don't want to teach. You
see, I believe we all have language within us. But whether we feel we have
the right to use it is another issue.'
Illiterate people were often extremely good speakers. A speech therapist at
Broadmoor, the asylum for the criminally insane, told her that when
murderers unburden themselves they speak with astonishing eloquence. 'He
said they speak poetry.'
At the other extreme there is the 'professional' voice. The hospital
consultant, the clergyman, the air hostess, the hotel receptionist, the
salesman: they all have one. It is a defence mechanism, Rodenburg explained.
'It's a voice that says 'I'm caring about you but I'm not caring absolutely
about you. Don't get too close.' I think journalists often do that voice.'
Do they? I replied, quickly dropping into a lower register.
Then there is the barking voice of the senior manager who talks at, not to,
his juniors and is hurt by accusations that he never listens.
'I call it the vocal push. Although we can hear everything that's said, we
don't listen because we're being battered over the head by the voice. People
not used to speaking in big spaces will automatically push, rather than just
breathing and focusing and waiting for the words.'
With a British general election looming, I asked if she could detect liars
by their voice.
'Yes. Maybe the pitch will go up a bit and the breath will change. Something
will change in the voice.'
Can you tell from a politician's voice whether you would vote for him?
'I think so, yes. I just want to say to some politicians, if you learned to
relax and open your voice we would listen more to what you are saying.'
What advice would you give John Major?
'Well, he has to free up his voice because it drones on. He's very tight in
the neck and the face. It's like a mask on him. The area round the cheeks is
very important because it opens the upper harmonics. Even if he is wanting
to sound interesting he can't. I wonder whether he has changed his accent
and doesn't feel happy with it.'
And Neil Kinnock?
'He's a good speaker, except he gets very tight. You can see him go very red
in the face and the veins start coming out on his neck. I don't think he
really breathes much so he sort of gets clamped around the throat. If you're
speaking three or four times every day, that's quite athletic. You're doing
the equivalent of an actor playing Lear.'
What about Paddy Ashdown?
She laughed and looked coy. 'Well, I think he's very good. Actually I taught
him a bit. All I did was just loosen him a bit around the shoulders and the
neck and into the face. On camera his face was closing, crinkling up.'
Britain's best-known elocution student is, of course, Margaret Thatcher.
Rodenburg said the result was pretty bad. The former prime minister had
pushed her voice down to make it sound better and 'de-voiced' it to make it
sound sympathetic. She had also mastered the unhealthy trick of breathing
against the flow of her words in order not to be interrupted.
Women develop different habits to men, Rodenburg said. 'It comes from years
of feeling that you can't say what you want. When it does come out it will
often come out in a very shrill or emotional way.' She cited the problems of
women in India who teach large classes of children when at home they speak
hardly at all, and the ease with which Portuguese women wail all day over a
corpse.
'On the other hand, since women's liberation, women are taking on a lot of
male qualities. In fact I think they've probably gone too far in pushing
down on their voices. A lot of women today are not listening, they're just
driving through.
'Men have historically been much freer to breathe in and speak out. They're
much more 'on' their voices. They finish thoughts, they finish words. But
recently I've noticed men adopting some of the female habits of devoicing
and hesitating and being emotional. A lot of my women friends complain that
their men are crying a lot.'
I asked her about voice and class.
'The voice matters most to the middle classes, because they make the rules.
There are upper class voices that are completely incoherent, but we don't
interfere with them. When people have power you are forced to listen.'
Does the Royal Family have a problem?
'Yes, they do. They hold their voices back.' She demonstrated.
Self-confidence can liberate the voice, as well. 'You hear posh-sounding
people in Mayfair restaurants; their voices are carrying not because they
are actually louder but because they are just letting them out. What they
say might be complete rubbish but they really believe they're interesting.'
Rodenburg thinks it can be harmful for people permanently to change their
accents, even if a few need to acquire 'received pronunciation' to go into
the theatre.
Would the country be a better place if everyone found their own voice?
'Yes. We would be freer, we would be breathing better, we wouldn't have so
many headaches. More important, most psychologists would agree that if we
can speak about ourselves we have a better control of our world.'
Would the crime rate go down?
'I would argue so, yes. People will kick things and smash things because
they can't make sounds or use words to explore what they are feeling. I
mean, we are in such a state that people with money will spend it going to a
therapist merely to talk about themselves.'
When you talk about people finding their voices, do you mean that in a
political sense as well as a physical one?
'Yes, I do. But on a very simple level. If you use your voice correctly and
naturally, you never feel it. It's effortless. And if you start speaking
with that energy people will listen to you, so you start to have power.
'There is no such thing as a naturally bad voice, only bad habits. I believe
that underneath we are all very eloquent.'

FT  29 FEB 92 / Arts: Still a macho nonconformist - A drink or two with
actor, raconteur and mimic Robert Mitchum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEETING Robert Mitchum requires an appetite for wild anecdotes and a
cast-iron liver. We met at 11. By 12.40. pm in his up-market local bar  -
the Biltmore Four Seasons Hotel in bougainvillaea-clad Montecito, 80 miles
up-coast from Los Angeles - the star had knocked back five double Martinis
and I had made my frail attempt to keep up with four dry sherries. (I had to
drive back to LA)
The lunch gong had not yet sounded and Mitchum, casting his narrative line
and hook, had already reeled in a screaming-and-kicking Otto Preminger, a
tyrannical Josef Von Sternberg, a river-soaked Marilyn Monroe, a
storm-tossed Sir David Lean and a squealing, swooning Michael Winner.
These celebrities struggled in the reminiscing grasp of the 74-year-old
actor with the hooded eyes, the basso voice and - first thing I noted as he
walked through the door - that indelible chest-first perpendicular walk. To
be Robert Mitchum is to be an immortal lining up for a place on cinema's
Mount Rushmore. He is one of those rare actors who define the line between
movie and theatre acting. In theatre you use vocal and gestural technique to
travel the imaginative distance between yourself and the role. In cinema,
where impersonation is seen through at the first close-up, your own
personality must be strong enough, magnetic enough to make the role come to
you.
Mitchum was supposed to be talking to me about his new film Cape Fear,
opening in Britain on March 6, in which he makes a dry-witted cameo
appearance as a Southern sheriff. The film is Martin Scorsese's remake of
the 1962 hoodlum-at-large thriller in which Mitchum starred with Gregory
Peck. But we left the new film after a few dutiful burblings: 'It was
pleasant enough, three days in Fort Lauderdale, free lunch . . .'. And why
had Scorsese cast him? 'I guess just to add a little panache to the cast
list, you know . . .'
Two minutes of this and we pressed the rewind button. Mitchum has had an
amazing career. Not just on the screen, where his nonchalant approach to
acting in films like Out of the Past, Macao, The Sundowners and Heaven
Knows, Mr Allison has led critics to talk of sleepwalking buzzards or sharks
on sleep-cure, but off the screen. His professional life began with arrest
and scandal, though Mitchum now claims he was 'set up' for the famous 1947
marijuana bust that put him in jail and would have finished most actors'
careers. Instead it enhanced Mitchum's reputation as a macho nonconformist.
He attained pack-leader status among the stars of the deglamorised postwar
era. 'It was the age of ugly leading men,' he recalls. 'Before that you had
the Tyrone Powers and Robert Taylors. Suddenly the Bogarts came in and you
had these ordinary, protean heroes.'
The stars playing them were not ordinary, though, even if Mitchum today
makes a signature tune out of self-deprecation. He sort of, well, drifted
into stardom in the early 1940s; after jobs as a Lockheed factory hand, a
radio continuity writer and a Hopalong Cassidy stunt player. 'Jimmy Stewart
had won an Oscar around that time and his wife said to my wife, 'Look, if
that tall lean drink of water can do it, your man can do it.' So I took a
shot.'
The Mitchum I was with took the occasional shot too. When Martini number
three was handed to him, he returned the stickful of olives to the waitress
with the single censorious word 'Displacement]'
Mitchum in the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s was one of the wonders of
the movie business. He was not the only star who auto-piloted through roles;
think of Alan Ladd, Glenn Ford or Dana Andrews. But he was the only one who
was never dull doing it. He brought a lordly contempt to bad films and a
slight but electrifying increase in voltage to good films. After crossing
swords with Tinseltown's Third Reich - including the quarrelsome Otto
Preminger ('The crew were gonna drop a lamp on him') and the Macao-directing
Josef Von Sternberg ('He couldn't get the script right, I'd keep meeting
myself coming through a door') - he secured the role of his career in 1955
in Charles Laughton's sole directing foray The Night Of The Hunter.
Grown cinephiles are known to weep with joy at this film. Its spooky tale of
a wandering preacher (Mitchum) and the two children he terrorises is like
Hansel And Gretel crossed with L'Atalante. Mention the film to Mitchum and a
lightbulb goes on behind his eyes. 'Charles was beautiful. I remember he
called me up and said (purse-mouthed Laughton impersonation) 'I've got a
story here, Bob, about an unremitting shit.' I said, 'Present.' And he said,
'Well, I'm not really suited to this, you know. I'm earning my living now
reading the Bible.'
'Anyway, he did the film and he wrote the script, even though James Agee is
credited. Agee just wrote the treatment, all eighteen pounds of it. Charles
came to my house and he'd work on the screenplay at the same time as he was
staging The Caine Mutiny up in Santa Barbara. And he was marvellous.
Marvellous with the camera too. He would invent these Toytown effects, like
the frog and the owl in the foreground of scenes. And in that shot through
the barn window, when you see the preacher ride across the horizon, he did
that on a soundstage, you know] With a midget actor on a miniature pony to
evoke the distance.'
The Night Of The Hunter was Mitchum's best role and best film. He drew from
experience - 'I knew those guys, those itinerant psalm-shouters from the
South' - and he drew on his own resources of blackhearted Irish charm.
Indeed the jaded, droop-lidded Mitchum we often see on screen, when a
movie's pay packet is too large and its acting challenge too small, has no
resemblance to the Mitchum I was meeting now. Inside the star is a
raconteur; inside that, a mimic. He gave me Marilyn Monroe mouthing
superstitious mantras before taking a dash into a torrent on Preminger's
River Of No Return. (She broke her leg. Mitchum had warned her.) He gave me
Michael Winner squealing with terror and fainting on the set of The Big
Sleep when Mitchum gave the British director a 'friendly' bear hug. And he
gave me David Lean, exasperated and Etonian as the Irish weather wrecked his
shooting schedule on Ryan's Daughter.
Mitchum is no respecter of reputations and that includes his own. 'Any time
a director ran out of script,' he says when I ask him to define what
Hollywood saw as the Mitchum star quality, 'he'd cut to me having the
bejeesus beaten out of me.' No actor has fallen off horses, dragged himself
through swamps or been pummelled by passing pugilists as much as he. 'It's
because for years I had no stunt double. So when the studio wanted an actor
to throw around they knew I'd been through it all before.' No wonder his
favourite role is the bedridden Admiral in The Battle Of Midway; the third
part offered to him in that movie after he turned down two other Admirals
who would have been required to stand or walk.
Mitchum could also turn down roles for less frivolous reasons. He rejected
two films that later gained Oscars for his replacements. The script of In
The Heat Of The Night, in which Rod Steiger would triumph, had a man being
thrown out of a bar in the first scene. 'They don't have bars in that state]
It was a dry state. If they got that wrong, what else would they get wrong?'
And he handed the role of Patton to George C. Scott even though - or because
 -Mitchum passionately admires the Second World War General. 'We'd be
shooting in Spain and all that artillery would be paraded and there'd be a
wide screen and Patton's character would just disappear. So I recommended an
actor who I thought would fight for it. And he did.'
Mitchum himself could fight when he wanted to and for some surprising
characters. He fought to inject real menace into the first Cape Fear.
Playing a darker variant on his Night Of The Hunter hoodlum, he gave the
best performance of his middle years: sombre, insolent, witty, with reserves
of frightening dementia kept till the final showdown.
In the new Cape Fear Mitchum gives the best performance of his late years.
In a tiny role he wins the movie's two biggest laughs: for his mordant
delivery of lines I shan't spoil your fun by revealing. Surrounded by
younger actors going ape in a plot that encourages them to - Robert De Niro,
Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange - Mitchum stands back and shows us why he has been
a star for 50 years. He is above it all. He twinkles placidly in a firmament
where, if you have the right personality wattage, doing nothing can be as
luminous as doing everything.
Would he change anything in his career? 'No. I sometimes think I should have
kowtowed to the system more . . . but no, I couldn't have done it. You have
to smile at all those prize nights, go to all those film festivals to get
some statue they've knocked up. And you know what they're thinking: 'Let's
invent an award and present it to some freak.' I was in Italy once and they
wanted to give me a Rudolph Valentino award. I thought about it. A few days
of pasta and red wine. But then I thought no, let them give it to some other
guy. So they gave it to Steve McQueen who happened to be passing through
town.'
And what about a second life behind the camera? Would he have liked, like
his hero Laughton, to direct?
This gets an interested pause but the same eventual answer. 'Well, you gotta
get there in the morning before everybody else. You gotta spend all night
doing your homework. You gotta see the rushes. Uh-uh' (shake of the head).
'No-o' (reasonable man's sigh). 'Just say the lines, kiss the girl, take the
money, and run.'

FT  29 FEB 92 / Arts: Very Heath Robinson - William Packer admires an old
favourite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO HAVE one's name enter the language is rare enough a distinction, one
usually reserved to the inventor by virtue of the eponymous invention -
mackintosh, biro, wellington, umbrella: well, perhaps not umbrella. For an
artist to do so through his work must be rare indeed, and as a bare and
general descriptive too, without benefit of qualifier or pointer, as in
'Titian-haired'. 'Hogarthian', 'Dickensian' or 'Turneresque' do not really
count, for being too close to the work itself and its context, a very
particular mise-en-scene.
Yet the cartoonist and illustrator, William Heath Robinson, managed to pull
off the trick within the few years of the First World War and after. By the
end of the 1920s his name was in the language, and there it has remained,
active and meaningful still, through decades in which the work itself has
slowly begun to fade from the collective memory.
By the time of the Second World War, he was a national institution, his
humane and ludicrous satires catching exactly the national mood, a most
effective and ironical shield against War and all its horrors. It is a nice
paradox that to those generations with direct experience of total war, his
visual pleasantries were entirely acceptable, while to us, whose battles
come by way of the television screen, they might seem arch, escapist, even
inappropriate. War kills people: don't make jokes: someone might be upset.
So it is that with Heath Robinson we have the curious case of work that is
certainly less generally familiar than it was, and yet the associative power
of the word in no way diminished. How very Heath Robinson it is, we say, as
we look at some wretched, gim-crack contrivance of wire and string and
sticky tape, any improvised system of rods and pulleys, any kind of
mechanical first-aid. We all know just what we mean.
It is good, therefore, to be brought back directly to the work, and to
confront again the extraordinary visual inventiveness from which such
meaning sprang. William Heath Robinson was born in 1872 and died in 1944,
the youngest of three brothers, all of whom were to distinguish themselves
as illustrators. Now, at the Royal Festival Hall (until March 29), as part
of Towards the Millennium, that on-running celebration, through the 1990s,
of the 20th century, the South Bank Board is showing his Machines and
Inventions. The exhibition has been arranged by Chris Beetles, who has also
put on a large show of the work of the three brothers together, Thomas,
Charles and William, at his London gallery (8 Ryder Street, St James's SW1,
until March 20).
They all come of the same school of British illustration, that in late
Victorian and Edwardian times had proved so robust, rich and various in
talent, from Tenniel and Keene, through Morris, Crane and Beardsley to
Rackham and Dulac. But it is William who is at once the most graphically
original and inventive, besides being by far the most humorous of the three.
His has been a lasting influence, with Nicholas Bentley perhaps his most
distinguished follower in terms of formal example, but also Pont, and both
Ronald Searle and Roland Emmett in terms of surreal invention.
The jokes still work wonderfully, the explosions and the splashes, the
tunnels and balloons, the spikes and levers, but it is the graphic
sophistication that is now, if anything, the more astonishing and enjoyable.
He moves from inside to outside, from underwater to mid-air, from diagram to
description, with the most disconcerting uet convincing ease and certainty.
Cranes and tanks, submarines and aeroplanes, divers and balloonists, cooks
and waitresses, all give him particular joy.
Here is a tramp-steamer about to pin an enemy submarine to the ocean floor
by mounting an attack with trunks and sea-chests; here a diver snipping the
bait from the fisherman's hook; here a drilling frame to keep raw recruits
in step; here a tea-shop regulating machine, to measure out the rationed tea
and sugar. Underground, far below no-man's land, the British siphons off the
German soldier's beer. The cook pumps the steaming dinner plate up the
service shaft to the anxious housemaid far above.
Always we work out the problem with him, follow the string from the bed to
the sprung shelf, to the lead weight which will fall on the bellows, which
will blow out the candle. Step by step, we read and accept the mad, credible
logic. If you live in a flat, of course you take your exercise in mid-air:
of course you do. Whatever next? Quite wonderful.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Arts: Showcase concerts for the BBCSO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC Symphony's contribution to the Barbican's tenth-anniversary
celebrations on Wednesday was to invite Pierre Boulez to conduct a showcase
concert of Birtwistle, Stockhausen, Berio and his own music. All the
composers have been the subjects of the BBC's winter series at the Barbican,
which have become such a valuable fixture in the Centre's calendar; only
Henze (featured in 1991, but a long-time Boulez bete noire) was missing from
the roster.
The concert was a typical Boulezian occasion. If the new Welsh National
Opera Pelleas gives glorious evidence of the ever-deepening command of his
interpretive powers, the performances here, with the BBCSO more willing and
responsive to his direction than they ever appeared to be when he was their
chief conductor, were a reminder that he still has no equals in the
contemporary repertory. In Birtwistle's  ..agm .., of which he gave the
first performance in Paris in 1979, the raw power and primitive lyricism of
the score were made more pungent than ever before, and the case for the work
as Birtwistle's finest achievement for the concert hall seems increasingly
unanswerable.
The programme ended with Berio's Sinfonia, which Boulez marshals and
controls with enormous virtuosity, drawing out the luscious textures with
magical clarity, making the famous collage movement an orchestral as well as
a a compositional tour de force. Electric Phoenix were the vocalists, as
deft as any incarnations of the Swingle Singers ever were. It was prefaced
by a playback of Stockhausen's Gesang der Julinge, now sounding distinctly
low-tech and drily pointilliste, yet somehow retaining its freshness intact.
A distinguished occasion; they really don't make many contemporary-music
concerts as good as this nowadays.
A week earlier the BBC Symphony appeared with David Atherton in the Festival
Hall for an accomplished double-bill of rarely heard Stravinsky ballets - an
invigorating coupling of near-masterpieces, Orpheus from 1948 and
Persephone, written to Andre Gide's text in 1933. When so scrupulously
prepared and loving detailed, they are shown off to best advantage, and the
neglect of Persephone in particular seems hard to understand.
Caught on the cusp between the last rites of Stravinsky's neoclassicism and
his rebirth as a serialist, Orpheus remains problematic, but the earlier
work is a rich repository of finely-tuned gestures, a dictionary almost of
Stravinsky's vocabulary of classical myths. In it one recognises many of the
turns of phrase from other contexts - the choral implorations of Oedipus and
its menacing ostinatos , the elegant cadences of Apollo - yet in Persephone
they seem not at all tired or recycled but gain a fresh purity and
directness. The solo tenor in the role of Eumolpus was John Aler, effective
and unflashily rhetorical; the Persephone was Laurence Bouvard, who
delivered the lines with an easy fluency which by-passed all the usual
problems of making melodrama work.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Arts: When politics and art don't mix - The work of Alfredo
Jaar at the Whitechapel Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOOD INTENTIONS do not necessarily lead to good works of art, especially if
the intentions are political as well as artistic. Alfredo Jaar, the Chilean
artist whose exhibition Two or Three Things I Imagine about Them is at the
Whitechapel Gallery until March 29, means well. He has set himself the task
of bringing into our western art space images of people who live and work in
some of the most miserable conditions in the so-called third world.
His subjects include the toilers in the hellish gold pit of Serra Pelada in
Brazil, the residents of Koko, in Nigeria, where toxic wastes from Europe
and the US have been dumped, and refugees from Vietnam interned in Hong
Kong. He presents them in photographs, some taken by himself, some selected
from other sources, displayed on light boxes. The light boxes are then
arranged in installations of varying degrees of complexity, the purpose of
which is to make us experience both the physical and the political distance
which separates the viewer from the subject.
So far so admirable. The problem is the works just don't work - or rather
they do, but in such a simplistic fashion that instead of being moved and in
some way involved with the people whose lot he or she has been invited to
contemplate, the spectator is more likely to be appalled at the assumption
that such poorly conceived gallery tricks could begin to embody the
complexities of perception and experience they dare to hint at. An example:
the images of individual Brazilian gold miners in 'Out of Balance', 1988,
are set at the edges of their light boxes, the catalogue explains, because
the miners are 'marginal' to the developed world. Yes, really . . . that's
all. The piece 'Untitled (Water)', 1990, at first sight works better. Here,
five light boxes show images of the sea. Behind them, 25 small mirrors
reflect fragments of the images on the other side of the light boxes, of
boat people either at sea or grouped in internment camps. As a metaphor,
this works, but only until curiosity prevails and we walk up to the
floor-set boxes and peer behind them to see the images of the people on the
other side 'properly'. This lack of control in the placing of the boxes
makes it possible to undermine the whole point of the installation, which is
surely to allow us to realise that what we think we 'see' of such people is
inevitably both The gold miners and refugees are passive subjects, brought
to us from far away. Trapped in their boxes, they do not answer back. Not so
the pupils of the Mulberry School for Girls, some of whose pupils Jaar had
had photographed (with their and their parents' consent), to form part of
the installation Two or Three Things I Imagine about Them which fills the
lower gallery. This is a new piece specially commissioned for the
exhibition: its subject is the Bangladeshi community of Whitechapel.
When the young women saw that the large colour photos of their faces -
individual, identifiable, local faces - had been overlayed with quotes from
remarks made by a Bangladeshi some time in the fifties, referring to the
compatriots he employed as home workers and saying, amongst other things
'They are all illiterate', they objected. The uncredited text imposed over
their faces made it look as if either they had said the words themselves or
that their images had been defaced with the anonymous racist slurs so
familiar in our streets.
After a meeting with the girls at the school, and a discussion about what he
had been trying to achieve in the work, Alfredo Jaar agreed to take the
pictures down. Seven of the 18 lightboxes which hang from the gallery
ceiling are now empty, their unlit neon tubes exposed. The others retain
images of young women's faces or close ups of their eyes. Other elements of
the exhibition include film, sound, neon and mirrored walls.
Just inside the entrance, a screen blocks the way. On it is projected upside
down the head of a woman asking questions such as 'How to learn to see
differently? Who sees? Who is seen?' in English and Bengali. The screen is
reflected in a pool of water and the spectators gazing at the ensemble are
themselves reflected in two large mirrored panels which flank the video
screen. This hotch potch of high tech and high ideals, put together by a
sophisticated artist, a distinguished cultural critic (Gayatri Chakravorty
Spivak, who is the questioning head and Professor of English and Comparative
Literature at Columbia University in New York), numerous assistants and a
battery of technology fails to achieve a unity of content and form able to
withstand the critique of the young women whose lives it claimed to make
visible and whose artistic judgment is to be commended.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Arts: How Britain wrestled with the sumo factor - A look
back at the success of the Japanese Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'OUT OF the gourd comes a pony' is a Japanese proverb for something pleasant
but extremely unlikely. The Japan Festival, which finally ended this month,
was the most ambitious attempt ever to introduce one country to the culture
of another. So much was often stated during the Festival's duration, eight
remarkably successful months. Less clear was the resemblance between it and
the proverbial pony: the Festival was a rabbit which nearly did not make it
out of the hat.
The Festival was not an exercise in Japanese cultural diplomacy. It was a
British initiative, growing from an idea mooted in 1986 by Martin
Campbell-White, chief executive of Harold Holt Ltd, a firm of international
concert promoters.
Initial plans were for ten or so events in London. Sir Peter Parker became
Chairman, and it was decided to link the Festival to the centenary of the
Japan Society in 1990. More significantly, the Festival was then planned as
a nationwide event. Management costs were initially estimated at about
Pounds 900,000, with Midland Bank as the founding sponsor.
'The Topsy effect set in', recalls Graham McCallum, chairman of the steering
committee. The Festival grew as more and more venues and events were
suggested. In December 1989, the Festival's fate hung in the balance.
Projects were already beginning to roll. Plans to bring events such as sumo
wrestling to Britain were obviously going to be inordinately costly. But
there was still no secure sponsorship.
The atmosphere was tense. 'Recent disasters like the Commonwealth Games in
Edinburgh were always in the back of one's mind', says McCallum. Many
companies turned the committee down, asking why the Festival was not
sponsored from Japan.
The Japanese, however, at that stage did not want a big festival. 'They
could not see why they should concentrate so much effort on the UK.' says
McCallum. The saviour of the Festival was Sir Ian Hunter, doyen of
festivals. He suggested the committee should go for core funding, boldly
asking UK companies with Japanese interests to pay Pounds 20,000 into the
Festival - a figure upped to Pounds 50,000.
The 25 'Festival Benefactors' would get nothing obvious in return for their
largesse beyond their names on a list. But in Japan, they would be seen to
have made a commitment to taking Japanese culture seriously, rather than
just seeking commercial advantages. Would they bite?
Inchcape plc and SG Warburg plc were approached first, and agreed. The ball
had started to roll. The fundraisers' luck was extraordinary and may well
prove unrepeatable, at least for the foreseeable future. According to David
Barrie, a Festival director, 'If the search had started even two months
later, we wouldn't have made it.' If the Gulf war had lasted a month or so
longer, the Festival could have been scuppered by Japanese companies pulling
out.
Press coverage more favourable than the organisers had dared hope also
proved to be crucial. Simultaneous fundraising in Japan was much slower to
take effect. 'Three-quarters of the way through the Festival, the Japanese
suddenly realised how much impact it had', recalls McCallum.
In the event, hundreds of Japanese companies contributed, rewarding the
efforts of a committee chaired by the formidable Shoichi Saba, former head
of Toshiba. Saba had his initial doubts. 'Some Japanese companies were
afraid that contributing to the event would reinforce the image of Japan
being an economic animal. A fear of the festival being dubbed as a 'cultural
invasion' and linked to the increase in financial and economic activities of
Japanese companies in the UK did exist among some companies.'
A number of Japanese sponsors doubted the Festival would work, but gave all
the same. How would the British public respond to kabuki or bunraku? Or sumo
wrestling? Many Japanese believed it impossible to transplant such uniquely
Japanese phenomena.
Toyota commented: 'We were not really expecting any direct results from
sponsoring the festival'. At Hitachi, scepticism was based on the Japanese
public's lack of interest in the 1990 British festival in Tokyo.
Nonetheless, Hitachi went ahead with sponsorship of the sumo tournament at
the Albert Hall and was comfortably surprised by by the response. 'The 'Sumo
fever' was amazing, and we feel we contributed to cultural understanding
between Japan and the UK.'
Shoichi Saba, too, did not reckon with the sumo factor. 'I was surprised by
the enormous popularity of sumo. I did not expect such an interest in it in
the UK.'
A final verdict on the Festival makes little sense. It was, quite simply,
too vast. Two opinion surveys conducted in the course of the Festival, one
by the Anglo-Japanese Economic Institute, indicated a favourable response
and a good level of public awareness. In the end, however, it was not the
robots, the lady lute-player in the Orkneys, nor even those glassy-eyed
medieval abbots in the British Museum, who proved the most eloquent
ambassadors for Japanese culture. It was the giants in pinnies, parading
around the Albert Hall.
The visit of the 68 wrestlers - plus an entourage of another 60 people,
hairdressers, judges, and the like - cost well in excess of Pounds 2
million. But Campbell-White has three sponsors anxious to back a second
visit. The Japanese pony will not come out of its gourd again, that much is
sure. But at least, come autumn 1995, there is a chance that the gourd will
yield us up those magical fat men.

<TEXT>
MICHAEL BUERK, lately the BBC's Southern Africa correspondent, has begun a
new Sunday series on Radio 4, Africa, Deadline for the Dark Continent. He
begins at Africa's, perhaps the world's, most disturbed place, Somalia. His
account of life in Mogadishu - little food, little medicine, and the relief
convoys robbed by the so-called police - was appalling. Each local warlord
is at war with others; there are freelance killers, with seemingly endless
weapons. You must have arms, or looters may come to your house and fire a
rocket-launcher through the door. Help is provided by Belgians, Irish,
Italians and others, but they have no stores.
Buerk hopes for Western intervention, but Somali 'leaders' not. 'This is
only a conflict of tribes,' we are told. A wiser man reckoned, 'The
colonialists left too soon; we were not ready to understand what a nation
is.' By chance, in the last of his stimulating Radio 3 series, Bryan Magee,
considering Nationalism and the Melting Pot Myth, came to a like conclusion;
he quoted Dag Hammerskold in the Congo operations, 'They are not ready for
it.'
Radio 3 began its 'Chekhov and After' season on Sunday with a repeat of John
Tydeman's fine 1965 Three Sisters, with Jill Bennett, Lynn Redgrave and
Rosalie Crutchley as the sisters and Paul Scofield as Major Vershinin. On
Tuesday they gave Mrs Vershinin, a fascinating piece in which Helen Cooper
looks at the major's domestic life.
Yeliena Vershinina is roundly described by Toozenbach in Act 1 of the
Chekhov, and we know that on the night of the fire she abandoned her
children in their nightclothes and took refuge at the Prozorovs. Cooper
traces her back to her childhood, her courtship, then to her married
quarters. Her old father and mother also live there, but the major is too
often at the Prozorovs. 'It's the dark one,' they say. When the battery is
ordered to Poland, Yeliena won't have it. She and her daughters are going to
Moscow, walking if necessary. Infection, evidently. Julie LeGrand gave a
sensitive portrayal of her unhappy decline. No other characters from Chekhov
are used. Ned Chaillet produced.
Radio 4's Monday play was Mary Morgan, a novelettish piece by Greg Cullen
about a serving-girl hanged for killing the baby she had from the heir to a
prosperous family. At her trial (early 19th century), the young man was
foreman of the jury. By then he was about to make an advantageous marriage.
A guilty verdict was socially and dramatically essential. Mad King George
III appeared as an extra. The tale is said to be true, but it sounded pretty
fictional in Jane Dauncey's competently novelettish production.
The motion before the third of the Radio 4 debates on Sunday was that 'The
time has come to disestablish the Church of England,' and the lively
discussion must have held the 9 per cent of the British people that still go
to church. Tony Benn (proposing) brought up such matters as equality of
faiths, appointment of bishops, blasphemy, and could not help saying that
Conservatives controlled our faith through the BBC. The Bishop of
Peterborough (opposing) wisely drew attention to the 'bread-and-butter'
services - baptisms, weddings, funerals - that so many non-churchgoers still
find necessary. The motion was lost by 73 to 77. These debates are better
than Any Questions or phone-ins; the quality of participants is higher.
I interviewed Cliff Richard in about 1960. He seemed to me a serious sign of
the times. Modest and likeable, with hair on his chest, he had little to
tell me; Elvis Presley was his hero, Christianity came later. Now Wired for
Sound, a six-part series on Radio 2 (Sundays), will tell more, for instance,
that he thinks Madonna too sexy - though Jack Good of television's Oh Boy]
thought Cliff 'the sexiest animal on television'. The first programme was
only biography, however. Radio 1 will deal with Elvis next week - Elvis
Costello, I mean.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Arts: Musical agents strike up a band - Off the wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW years ago some of the world's leading classical soloists and
conductors rarely appeared in London: the fees offered were beneath their
dignity. They still are, but sweeteners from sponsors, and promotional money
from record companies, has helped entice them over. Now it is the world
class orchestras that are leaving London off their visiting ist.
The musical audience in the capital is too satiated with product; too
conservative in its taste to give the orchestras the welcome they feel they
deserve. Recent concerts by the star orchestras of Berlin and Vienna were
not the box office sell outs confidently anticipated, perhaps because seat
prices touched Pounds 60. And foreign orchestras, which usually lose money
from touring and only do it to acquire prestige at home, are pulling in
their horns in face of the global recession, and staying quietly put.
This is posing problems for musical agents in London, six of whom are
defying convention by merging their personal interests into the London
International Orchestral Season at the South Bank from April. Six
orchestras, ranging from the Chicago Symphony to the Novosibirsk
Philharmonic from Siberia, are being promoted as a package of which 660
subscriptions were sold in the first two weeks.
Basically each agent is organising the trip by its tied orchestra and
contributing to the marketing costs of the Pounds 500,000 venture. The
interest generated by a 'series' means it is worth taking the financial risk
of bringing over an orchestra like the Philadelphia which has been absent
for years. The South Bank, which loves seasons, is making its financial
contribution. The avid concert goer who takes in all seven concerts (the
Chicago plays twice) pays out Pounds 168.75p but saves 25 per cent on the
full price.
There could be another reason why foreign orchestras are no longer
guaranteed box office hits in London: the playing of home based orchestras
has improved enough to satisfy the concert going audience.
* * *
It is an open secret that Bernard Haitink will not renew his contract as
musical director of the Royal Opera House Covent Garden when it expires at
the end of the current season. Unlike his predecessors, Sir Georg Solti and
Sir Colin Davis, he has scarcely hogged the podium there - this season he
has confined himself to two Ring cycles and Don Giovanni.
Jeremy Isaacs will need all his powerful persuasive skills to nab a proven
successor. The obvious candidate for one of the biggest jobs in the music
world is Claudio Abbado, but after a battering at Vienna and only recently
arrived at the Berlin Philharmonic, he may not relish the additional
politicking involved at Covent Garden - to say nothing of a possible period
of closure if the House finally gets its redevelopment money.
With associate musical director Sir Edward Downes proving his skills with
the Italian repertoire in last season's revitalisation of Verdi's Attila,
Isaacs could well seek a German expert. High on his list must be Christoph
Dohnanyi, who has enjoyed some good evenings in the Garden pit and is booked
to conduct the new Flying Dutchman in June. Covent Garden's artistic
administrator Peter Katona used to manage von Dohnanyi in Germany.
The main problem could be the orchestra, which finds him authoritarian. But
perhaps they need a little discipline.
* * *
The arts are unlikely to feature prominently in the budget on March 10 but
there are reports that it may contain additional money for the Foundation
for Sport and the Arts, raising its honey pot from Pounds 60m a year to
Pounds 100m. The Foundation is the device by which the pools companies
delayed the arrival of a national lottery, which would badly hit their
income. The Treasury is fond of the pools promoters - and the revenue from
the betting levy - and is anti-lottery. It came up with a scam by which it
cut the betting levy by 2.5 per cent in return for which the promoters
coughed up Pounds 60m to give to needy causes in sport and the arts.
Rather surprisingly the scheme has worked and dozens of arts companies have
received up to Pounds 500,000 since last autumn from the Pounds 20m which
the Foundation earmarks for the arts. Soon over 30 organisations will hear
good news as the Foundation has a spending binge before its financial year
ends in April. Much of the money goes into building projects, like the
Pounds 500,000 for turning the Empire in Edinburgh into an opera house, and
the Pounds 500,000 to shore up the Theatre Royal Norwich. But education and
touring are also favoured. Proposals for a national lottery will still
appear in the Tory Election Manifesto, but if there is more money for the
Foundation in the budget there will be no rush to introduce a lottery
whatever party forms the Government.
* * *
Bonhams may be by far the smallest of the four London based auction houses
but it is probably the only one that has made a profit in the past year. It
is currently looking for new markets which take up little space and provide
a useful contribution to turnover and it will shortly hold auctions of
coins, miniatures and icons. In 20th century ceramics it already leads the
field. It is also considering holding sales of bags, and in April will take
big time auctioneering to Jersey.
Bonhams also intends to get back into wine. It stopped holding sales over a
decade ago, but the country is currently awash with the stuff and hotels,
restaurants and wine shippers desperately want to off-load wine to pay off
their debts. The best vintages will be sold at auction, but Bonhams is
considering selling wine by tender from regional centres.
It would be a novel move for a saleroom, but in line with the current
attitude of anything goes. The traditional auction business has been so
quiet lately, especially in the main rooms of Sotheby's and Christie's, that
there is time to pursue initiatives. This week Sotheby's linked up with Page
and Moy to organise a series of country hotel weekends full of antique talk,
while Christie's is playing host to a series of evening seminars sponsored
by the FT. Starting on March 16 they lead you gently through the auction
world. Details from Nigel Pullman at the FT.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Arts: Dancing up the wall - V-Tol's contribution to Spring
Loaded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DANCE images proposed by Mark Murphy in his choreography are linked with
the idea of Vertical Take-Off in aeronautical flight, whence comes his
company's title, V-Tol. Movement is reckless, daring, as bodies zoom and
plummet, crash into each other or to the floor, or hang suspended from the
wall that is part of the set for this new 70-minute piece at The Place.
Under the engaging title of Time spent in the company of bad people - a
promise alas unrealised, for the characters are not in the least bit wicked,
merely dull - Murphy and his colleagues (Keely Mancini, Kristina Page, James
Hewison) explore domestic angst at some considerable length and with no less
considerable energy.
The staging, which I saw on Thursday night, is part of The Place's Spring
Loaded season. Murphy's movement style is immediately gripping, and
theatrically sure. Two block-like chairs and a sofa, with a sheltering wall,
are first revealed to us in a series of snapshots in which the cast (who are
collaborators in the dance) take up positions vertical or horizontal, cling
to the wall or balance above and under the furniture, which is itself
hoisted on to the wall to suggest altered vistas of reality. The effect is
of shifting perspectives, or aerial shots of an interior. Murphy extracts
maximum value from this before the dance proper begins and bodies are hurled
at other bodies, or curl and thresh and twist in vivid brush-strokes of
dynamics.
The short-term rewards are many, but the manner seem ultimately
self-defeating. Unlike DV8, whose influence, if slight, is perceptible,
V-Tol does not provide a coherent emotional argument for the piece. We see
the two couples exercising their frustrations as if working out at a gym,
and we see them copulating - twice, which seems to exaggerate the value of
coition as a relief from boredom. But we do not see V-Tol's dance extending
into a more expressive language. It may be that Murphy's point is that
marital despairs are exactly so because of their lack of any variety or
horizon, and the deadpan bravura of his cast stresses this. But the piece,
which begins well, and has so sharp a physical edge, loses impact because of
its deliberately constrained vocabulary.
Performances are nonetheless to be valued - for their exactness of aim and
timing, and for their unsparing power in showing emotional frustration as a
kind of slamming, that punk-dance fashion in which brute force so acutely
expressed the brutalities of life. Design, by Miranda Melville, is sure (the
women wear dresses that could drive a girl to suicide), and the piece is
excellently lit by Simon Robertson. There is a score by Peri Mackintosh
which does what it does efficiently.

SWAN SISTER by Annie Dalton Methuen Pounds 8.99, 122 pages
WRITERS of fantasy for children often lay down their themes with all the
tact and delicacy of a constable in heavy boots. Children seem easy prey,
being young and gullible; the silliest notions can get past them if there is
a limitless cast of witches, fairies and boggle-eyed monsters.
In fact, the reverse is true. Children are remarkably astute judges of the
limits of truth and falsehood, and the best children's fantasy, whether
written by the likes of an Alan Garner, a Philippa Pearce or a CS Lewis, is
always firmly rooted in a recognisable moral universe and takes as its
starting point the real world in which we all live. The fantasy may hold up
a weird, distorting mirror to our reality; but without that reality, the
writing will remain rootless, ineffectual and, ultimately, boring.
Annie Dalton is a prolific author of fantasy for younger and older children
 -an earlier book, Night Maze, was short-listed for the 1989 Carnegie Medal
 -and her new novel, Swan Sister, explores profound themes in a pleasingly
unpretentious style. Ellen and her mother move from London to the east
Suffolk coast in order to realise a dream that her mother has long
cherished: that of creating a perfect home in the secret, magical place
where she herself had lived as a child. It would be a return to paradise.
Unfortunately, her daughter Ellen feels unhappy from the start. She senses
that this is not so much paradise as 'the shining edge of the world'. Would
it not be all too easy to fall over that edge and be lost forever? A number
of factors contribute to her growing sense of unease: the American jets that
scream through the summer sky; the power station that casts its shadow over
the little estuary town nearby; and, worst of all, the strange call of the
wild swans - 'Swa-swa siss swa siss' - that seems to come bearing warning
messages.
A new baby is born, Lily, and Ellen's mother prepares a room for her in
their cottage that seems to resemble a magic grove. But is it a friendly
place? Ellen thinks not. The new baby behaves oddly; she is curiously
self-absorbed and, when she grows, seems unable - or perhaps unwilling - to
communicate with other people. And when the baby is christened, the swans
fly over the church, calling, calling, and Ellen becomes increasingly
convinced that this odd child belongs in some way to them and not to the
family. She is a child of nature. Matters are made much worse by the gradual
breakdown of her parents' marriage, and Ellen's discovery that her father
was partially responsible for the creation of the power station that is
contributing to the destruction of the environment.
On the night of the child's third birthday, the swans abduct Lily. They had
warned Ellen this would happen, but she had never dared to tell. After all,
who would have believed her? In the company of her only friend, Misha, she
borrows a boat from Marsh Mary, a woman regarded by the locals as crazed
because she cares for - and talks to - nothing but birds and animals. Ellen
and Misha make many trips into the marshes, searching, searching for her
lost sister. They even hear the sound of Lily's voice calling to them - but
the swans tell Ellen that the time is not ripe for her rescue. That does not
happen until the day that Ellen's father returns from London and the family
is reconciled.
Why do the swans abduct the child in the first place? To compensate for the
loss of their own children? Or is it because Lily is a star-child who,
belonging to the visible and invisible world, understands their language? Or
could it be a way of punishing the human beings for desecrating their
natural habitat? All these possibilities are explored.
The novel moves with remarkable ease and sureness from the world of human
pain and unhappiness to that of the supernatural. The characters of Ellen
and her mother are utterly convincing; the language is that of real human
beings in pained conflict with each other; their motives are explored with
great tact and delicacy.

MALAYA 1941: THE FALL OF A FIGHTING EMPIRE by Andrew Gilchrist Robert Hale
Pounds 15.95, 185 pages
JUST 50 years ago this month the British imperial garrison at Singapore
surrendered to Japanese forces, after a mere two months during which Malaya
had been invaded and Churchill's 'fortress' besieged. Although these tragic
events may pale by comparison with 'the day of infamy' at Pearl Harbour on
December 7 1941, they should, after half a century, be remembered and
studied by anyone who wishes to know why the British Empire of the East
utterly collapsed. The consequences of that collapse (and somewhat illusory
post-war recovery) are with us today.
Sir Andrew Gilchrist was an experienced eye-witness of Japan's preparations
for war. He was in Singapore as Nemesis approached. He is a careful student
of the British Government's hapless search for appeasement or deterrent. Now
he has written an account of the all but insoluble strategic problems,
confusion at the command level and, above all, collapse of morale - indeed,
often sheer absence of it - which is to be commended for lucidity and for
that rare ability to see events as they overwhelmed participants at the
time, not as they appear by the light of retrospective wisdom.
The fundamental causes of British defeat at the hands of a race which even
quite enlightened Englishmen regarded as inferior - and certainly unable to
handle ships and aircraft with the skill of the Royal Navy and Royal Air
Force - were not only the absence of strategic resources in the Far East but
a lack of will to fight intelligently, boldly, or stubbornly with those
which were available or had been sent reluctantly, and belatedly, by the War
Cabinet in mid-October 1941. By this date two stark factors could no longer
be ignored in London: Japan was bent on war; Roosevelt would not keep 'that
Japanese dog quiet' - as Churchill had asked him to do in May 1940 - and
would certainly not help defend British Asiatic interests until the balloon
actually went up.
Impaled on the horns of these dilemmas, the British commanders - of whom the
most senior, air vice marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham was an elderly
dugout, intelligent but indecisive - advocated a pre-emptive operation
(MATADOR) into Thailand at one moment, rescinded it the next, then finally
abandoned it but then concocted a provisional warning order for moving
forces to the Thai border on December 6. That day Japanese forces were
sighted at sea, clearly bent on invasion. MATADOR had missed the bus;
immediate defeat was followed by collapse, redeemed by much gallantry,
sometimes by the least experienced troops, but leading to an inevitable,
humiliating fate.
Sir Andrew describes this melancholy affair in language which evokes
Somerset Maugham: Britain's Asiatic empire was not much to be proud of, and
when the yellow peril finally struck, headlong flight (for 'Whites only')
became a dominating emotion. Such cruel revelation of imperial decay was
however redeemed not only by those who fought on, but by two acts which
deserve a salute today: Prince of Wales and Repulse, sailing to their
inevitable doom thanks to lack of air cover, and Sir Shenton Thomas,
governor of the Straits Settlements. He, with his wife, stayed at his post
to endure with those who didn't get away 'four years of miserable
captivity'.
Sir Andrew cannot match Arthur Marder's Homeric narrative of the last voyage
and heroic death of Prince of Wales and Repulse, but he does remind any
reader with sensibility and imagination that, futile and horrible although
war always is, courage survives to sustain even forlorn hopes. By the same
token Sir Shenton, quiet, stolid, resolute, ensured that those left behind
in Singapore shared their captivity with a Governor moulded in an older,
honourable tradition.

SACRED HUNGER by Barry Unsworth Hamish Hamilton Pounds 14.99, 630 pages
MOTHER COUNTRY by Elisabeth Russell Taylor Peter Owen Pounds 14.95, 167
pages
SEPARATION by Sally Emerson Scribners Pounds 14.99, 248 pages
THERE IS a good story at the centre of Sacred Hunger about a spontaneous
mutiny aboard a slave trader in 1752. The mutiny is led by the ship's doctor
and a French passenger, who run the ship aground on the Florida coast and
set up a utopian community in which black and white live together in freedom
and equality. Running concurrently is a duller-than-ditchwater account of
the tribulations of the shipowner's son, Erasmus Kemp, whose prospects are
ruined by the apparent loss of the ship. His father commits suicide, Kemp is
forced to break off his engagement and spend the next 12 years recouping his
fortune in the sugar trade. When he hears rumour of the colony it is no
surprise that he sets out to destroy it.
Rousseau triumphed over Hobbes shortly after the events described here, and
nowadays we all believe that the slave trade was an abomination and that the
profit motive must be tempered by humanity. Profit, says the Frenchman,
playing devil's advocate, is 'that sacred hunger which justifies everything,
sanctifies all purposes'. Kemp is so obviously a prig and moral coward from
the very start that the attempt to make him represent that argument, which
is the interesting one from our point of view, is doomed to failure. It does
not help that the author chose to write the Kemp chapters in a strange
pastiche of 18th-century prose, complete with circumlocutions and lengthy
generalisations.
This is a pity because the shipboard sequences contain vivid vignettes of
the resilience of the press-ganged crew and their daily struggle with
brutality and humiliation. Neither Kemp nor his adversaries, the ship's
doctor and the Frenchman, ever come to life in the same way. These gentlemen
are merely mouthpieces for familiar arguments about the nature of greed,
corruption and cruelty.
As an investigation of the nature of cruelty, Elisabeth Russell Taylor's
novel is altogether more effective. The term 'child abuse' takes on a whole
new meaning after reading this account of one such victim. One of the
terrible things about cruelty is its unpredictability, as we see here.
Antonia is born in 1930 to a wealthy aristocratic Englishman and a
German-Jewish mother. Their reasons for tormenting her are complex, so much
so that she spends the rest of her life trying to understand them. Only
their friend, Walter, makes her childhood bearable, and at 21 she leaves
home and becomes his lover. After Walter's death, the novel, along with his
heroine, turns decidedly weird. It comes as a shock that Antonia, who has
never shown any interest in her Jewishness, should suddenly decide to
emigrate to Israel. 'I have discovered my identity: I am a microcosm of my
race.' Less than 20 pages later Antonia is dead, but those 20 pages leave
the reader reeling, from a combination of admiration and outrage and
perplexity that only a very fine quality of writing can provoke.
After that it was hard to take Sally Emerson's story of nanny-trouble among
the chattering-classes seriously, but I must admit I could not put it down,
partly from wide-eyed wonder at the total awfulness of all its characters.
Can people really be this self-centred and superficial? Is anyone really
supposed to believe in the outrageous coincidences that propel the so-called
plot?

work

UNDER THE JAGUAR SUN by Italo Calvino Jonathan Cape Pounds 10.95, 86 pages
SIX MEMOS FOR THE MILLENNIUM by Italo Calvino Jonathan Cape Pounds 5.99, 124
pages
WE MAY have joined the European Monetary Union but we British still have to
join the European Literary Union. Reading Calvino, the great Italian writer
who died in 1985, makes one realise just how isolated we are. That ceaseless
effort to impose a rejuvenating literary discipline upon imaginative
writing, comparable to the monetary discipline of the ERM, through a
continuous examination of the nature of fiction and its relation to life, is
something that has largely passed us by in Britain. Calvino was a tireless
experimenter as well as being a master of narrative. His experiments
benefited from the work of earlier moderns like Borges and Calvino's
compatriot Pirandello, who began in the theatre the radical work of
re-drawing the boundaries between life and the representation of life.
The most widely read fiction of Calvino's to show a similar concern was
called in English If on a Winter's Night a Traveller. Somerset Maugham is
supposed to have insisted that a story should always have a beginning, a
middle and an end. In this book Calvino took that traditional view apart. He
gives the reader a bewildering series of separate beginnings but no middles
and no endings. Each narrative breaks off tantalisingly just at the point
where our involvement in it has become total. Each aborted story was linked
to the last by a further narrative concerning an employee of an Italian
publishing house. His sets of proofs of the novels whose beginnings we read
are continually getting muddled. That narrative too ended inconclusively.
It is diabolically clever, yes; but it causes one to re-think one's reasons
for reading fiction. The same kind of structure of disparate narratives
inter-reacting within a single frame was the intention in Under the Jaguar
Sun, which was left unfinished at the time of Calvino's death and now
appears here in its incomplete form translated by William Weaver. Calvino's
widow Esther quotes a note on the manuscript by her husband underlining the
importance of the frame both in painting and in fiction: 'It allows the
picture to exist, isolating it from the rest; but at the same time it
recalls - and somehow stands for - everything that remains outside of the
picture.'
In this case a frame was never fitted. Lacking such a frame we have three
different stories, each exemplifying one of the five senses, that would have
been complemented by two more stories. The title story about a couple's
holiday tour in Mexico is centred on taste and has the reader salivating
greedily thanks to the author's evocation of piquant Mexican dishes - but
then in typical Calvino fashion the tale twists into a sinister register;
the reader, to his horror, realises that what these appetisers are leading
to is the eating of human flesh, the persistence in civilised society of
vulturism and even of cannibalism, its significance for religion.
Calvino's delight in analogies between the senses is given free rein,
especially in 'The Name, The Nose', dedicated to the sense of smell, as he
rhapsodises about '. . . . the phials, the ampules, the jars with their
spire-like or cut-glass stoppers' that weave 'their network of harmonies,
assonances, dissonances, counterpoints, modulations, cadenzas . . .' But
here again Calvino moves from the arousal of olfactory pleasure to the
ominous chill of mortality in the pungent odours of decay. The third tale,
'A King Listens', where the advance of the narrative is restricted to the
description of sounds, extraneous noises heard by a monarch isolated from
the outside world on his throne, has previously made an impression in London
via Luciano Berio's opera Un re in ascolto. This was memorably performed in
1989 at the Royal Opera House. In acknowledging the opera's debt to Calvino,
Berio unveiled an example of the way the European Literary Union works in
practice. It was a passage from Kafka's Diaries, quoted by Roland Barthes,
that inspired Calvino that inspired Berio. Add WH Auden speculating
poetically on The Tempest and Shakespeare and you have the complete list of
of the work's progenitors.
It is a similarly vast casting of the net across several major language
barriers in the European complex that distinguishes Calvino's last work, Six
Memos for the Next Millennium, translated by Patrick Creagh. These are the
texts of what would have been Calvino's Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at
Harvard in 1985. Only five of the Memos had been written at the time of his
death; no doubt he would have revised them further before publication but
the substance of them is eloquently present here and they make a fitting
coda to his career.
They affirm his passionate belief that literature will survive and flourish
into the next millennium because of its superior powers of communication
over all other media. Calvino expounds some of the unique powers of
literature under the headings Lightness, Quickness, Exactitude, Visibility,
Multiplicity. Explaining the last of these, Multiplicity, Calvino cites the
Milanese novelist Carlo Gadda, in whom a work of fiction became a repository
of encyclopedic knowledge; from there Calvino leaps to the Austrian Robert
Musil's Man Without Qualities, to Flaubert's Bouvard et Pecuchet, to Perec's
Life A User's Manual, a modern work demonstrating multiplicity for which
Calvino had the highest regard.
Taken together these Memos are a delightfully stimulating holiday from more
mundane reading; they represent the literary equivalent of a leisurely
cruise down one of the main European waterways with an erudite, enthusiastic
guide aboard communicating his passionate enthusiasms as the ship glides by
some of the more curious edifices of past and present.

INDIGO by Marina Warner Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 14.99, 402 pages
AS YEATS said, works of art beget works of art. All literature builds on
what has gone before, but a specifically and self-consciously derivative
tradition has yielded in recent years some of our most original drama and
fiction. There would be no Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead without
Hamlet, no West Side Story without Romeo and Juliet. Jean Rhys's
extraordinary Wide Sargasso Sea is based on Jane Eyre, David Lodge's Nice
Work on the Victorian condition-of-England novel, and now Marina Warner's
Indigo offers two interlocking plots, both replays of The Tempest.
In London from the 1940s to the 1980s, Miranda and her younger aunt-sister,
Xanthe, grow up in the colonial Everard family, whose ancestor, Kit, settled
a Caribbean island in the 17th century. Their story is told as a
contemporary folk tale. Xanthe at her christening receives the gift of
heartlessness from a fairy godmother, while Miranda is plagued by guilt and
obsession with her Creole inheritance. Their lives are a parable on the
benefits of heartlessness v feeling, being loved v loving, ignorant content
v self-aware torment. What is happiness? Love? A good childhood? Hundreds of
novels ask these questions, and Marina Warner gives her own answers as well
as many.
From Miranda's concerns comes the subplot, the first Kit Everard's
exploitative relationship with the islander-characters remodelled from The
Tempest. The witch, Sycorax, is a benign magician; a feminist Prospero;
Ariel, her daughter, becomes pregnant by Kit; Caliban, renamed Dule, is a
heroic resister to colonial expansion.
Anti-colonialist productions of The Tempest have been fashionable for years,
so Warner's approach is not new here. More innovative is her attempt to
rework the play in the context of other fairy tales, mostly about women's
roles, expectations, oppressions, position as icons. The novel is thus of
interest as a continuation of her work as cultural historian in books such
as Alone of All Her Sex, about the Virgin Mary cult, and Monuments and
Maidens.
Join the rich, artistic and magical transformations of The Tempest with this
intellectual background, and the result should also be a heady literary
brew. I wanted to enjoy it, but I stuttered over every cliche-ridden and
symbol-drenched page. Indigo is a trite family romance dressed up in a
breathtakingly pretentious mythical outfit and so overladen with academic
baggage that it barely moves or develops as fiction.
Inevitably, the density of multiple stories urges Warner towards theory and
schematic writing. Links and parallels are far too obvious - Miranda has a
child by a Caribbean actor playing Caliban, so matching Ariel and Kit; 1980s
island freedom fighters recall 1600s native insurgence. Tempest images are
gauchely plundered: 'He has already learnt to curse' (Caliban-Dule); 'I join
the air, the sky, the water, the heat' (Ariel); 'She wasn't living inside
one of Shakespeare's . . . late plays with their magical reconciliations,'
just before Miranda is reconciled with a lover.
In trying to recreate the play's magical strangeness, Warner overstates her
case, mixing schoolgirl lushness ('her cinnamon tawniness,' 'shining black
eyes like licorice'), travelogue lyricism and anthropological invention. But
an account of the island's linguistic history (ten words for the wind in the
palms) and Indigo-making traditions dotted with Shakespearian, even
Chaucerian, words like 'swive' does not impose an alternative fictional
reality. Warner simply does not have the imaginative vision to create an
incandescent other-world that makes you ache to be there, like, say, the
Egypt in the exotic subplot of Penelope Lively's Moon Tiger.
Only where she tries less hard - descriptions of smoggy, deprived 1940s
London; the Knokke convent where the lapsed Mrs Everard goes to regain her
soul - does the novel convince. But even in the contemporary fable Warner
can't resist drumming the message home. 'It was Xanthe rather who was to be
pitied: she did not know highs and lows or heat and cold but only the tepid
no man's land in between': the emphasis, the odds, are so weighted towards
Miranda, naughty little rich girl typical of the 'liberated' heroine of
recent fiction, that it is tempting to be drawn instead to unfashionably
repressed Xanthe.
The dogmatism is fatal. Myths and fairytales last and work because they
answer deep, timeless needs and desires; the same tales can provide a range
of consolations and inspirations for different people. The stories and
island myths which Marina Warner invents here have only contemporary
resonance; their intellectual intention is too strident for her readers' own
imaginations ever to take flight.

DREYFUS: A FAMILY AFFAIR 1789-19 45 by Michael Burns Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds
20, 572 pages
THE JEW ACCUSED: THREE ANTI-SEMITIC AFFAIRS 1894-1914 by Albert S. Lindemann
Cambridge Pounds 24.95, 311 pages
FRANCE IN the 19th century seemed a promised land for its Jews. At the time
of the revolution in 1789, the majority of French Jews had lived in Alsace.
Here they were barred from living in the largest cities, their occupations
were strictly limited and they were subject to special taxes.
These discriminatory laws were swept away with the old regime. In 1791 Jews
became citizens, equal with all other Frenchmen. More than this, the
progress of French commerce and industry opened opportunities for Jews
possessed with ambition and armed with cash.
Generations of the Dreyfus family had both. By the 1870's, the family's
position was secure enough for Alfred to forsake commerce and devote himself
to his country. He joined the army in the wake of France's military
humiliation in the Franco-Prussian war. There he pursued the revolutionary
promise of a career open to talent. But if 19th-century France was good for
the Jews, some people wondered whether the Jews were good for France.
Parisian shopkeepers and small businessmen were threatened by economic
depression in the 1880's. Catholic control of education was attacked by
anti-clerical republicans. Anti-Semites encouraged both groups to attribute
their misfortunes to the corrupt and Jew-ridden conditions of life under the
Third Republic.
The Jewish conspiracy appeared to be confirmed in 1894. Alfred Dreyfus, the
Jewish super-patriot, was disgraced as a traitor. His alleged crime was
selling military secrets to the German government. Dreyfus's trial was
accompanied by a campaign of anti-Semitism. His guilt was arrived at by a
process that combined conspiracy, prejudice and blunder. But five years
later, thanks to the efforts of his brother Mathieu and the honesty of
isolated French officers, Alfred was set free.
The Dreyfus Affair crystallised the opposing forces in French political
life: Catholics and anti-clericals, monarchists and republicans, socialists
and the military, battled over Alfred's fate. Their hopes and fears for
France were poured into the man.
Historians have followed contemporaries in preferring Dreyfus the symbol to
Dreyfus the man. Michael Burns redresses the balance. He has written an
account not only of Alfred Dreyfus but of his family as it rode the
vicissitudes of French history between revolution and liberation.
Half a century after Alfred was first accused, his grand-daughter Madeleine,
a worker in the French resistance, perished in Auschwitz. Burns wants us to
find in the Dreyfus case a training ground for the more deadly assault on
the French Republic and Dreyfus's descendants perpetrated by the Vichy
regime. But the contrast between Madeleine's fate and Alfred's underlines
the differences, not the similarities, between the circumstances they
confronted and the choices they were offered.
This contrast is reinforced by Albert Lindemann's stimulating study of The
Jew Accused. Apart from the Dreyfus Affair, Lindemann focuses on two other
trials before the First World War in which Jews were falsely accused of
terrible crimes. In Kiev, Mendel Beilis was charged and acquitted of the
ritual murder of a Christian boy. In Alabama, Leo Frank was lynched in the
belief that he murdered a young woman who resisted his sexual advances.
In view of his subject matter Lindemann's optimistic conclusions are
surprising, but they are also convincing. He is at his best on the Dreyfus
Affair. For as he says, what is most significant is that Dreyfus was
released, pardoned and, finally, vindicated. The Affair culminated with the
forces of anti-Republicanism and anti-Semitism in defeat and disarray.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Travel: Perfect pleasures for a Piscean at sea - Aerobics,
ping-pong, golf, napkin-folding: Michael Thompson-Noel found much to be
delighted by on a cruise from LA to Acapulco
</HEADLINE>

   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL

<TEXT>
DAY 1
IT IS 6.45am, and I am on the Promenade deck, port side, of the Norwegian
Cruise Line vessel Westward, off Baja California, puttering glassily
southward, bound for Acapulco. The ship left Los Angeles last evening.
Along the horizon, flashes of salmon and buttercup are heralding the dawn.
The sea is smooth and pewter-coloured. Everything is beautiful, everything
is perfect. In short, it is exactly the sort of morning that makes Pisceans
sad. Pisceans are often sad; they come especially equipped for it. So to
keep forlorness at bay, I have given myself a serious talking-to: convinced
myself that I am exactly the sort of person for whom a seven-day cruise, Los
Angeles to Acapulco, might have been invented.
The incident that set me off, that triggered my resolve to enjoy myself
wholeheartedly, occured 30 hours ago in the Cafe LA at the Airport Hilton,
where I was studying my American visa in a 17-year-old passport. As I went
to close the passport I noticed, with a shock, the photograph at the front.
Talk about a mess. I had shoulder-length hair, parted like a caveman's, a
smudge of designer stubble (in 1975?), and eyes as big as dinner plates. But
I seemed to be having fun. Even in the photo-booth I had found something to
laugh about, some inconsequentiality that, even 30 hours ago, had made me
laugh again in recognition of the person I was 17 years ago, and the person
I am still: a smile on a stick.
To judge from the Cruise News, the good ship Westward offers non-stop fun.
There is an interdenominational church service, all faiths welcome.
Low-impact aerobics. Capt Peder Vebenstad's morning update via the public
address system. Paddle tennis. Ping-pong. Shuffleboard. Coffee club. Hair
and beauty demonstration. Gym instruction. Fashion show. Tour of the ship's
bridge. Golf clinic. Fitness centre. Cinema. Trapshooting with an officer
(Dollars 10 for ten shots, cash only). And the slot machines in the casino
open at 9am with a free bloody mary for each lucky punter.
At 1pm I attend a session entitled 'Napkin Folding' presented by
inexhaustible cruise hostess Amanda Felts, 24, who is pretty and dizzy and
has a degree in recreation from the University of Illinois. Amanda has been
working on NCL cruise ships for 3 1/2 years. There are 80 people at the
session, learning how to fold napkins.
'Now,' says Amanda, as I enter the dining room, 'this is where the starch is
gonna come in handy with your four loose ends which you're gonna pull
through like this into a bird-of-paradise.'
At 7.45pm there is a cocktail party hosted by Capt Vebenstad, followed by
dinner at the captain's table. The captain is a pleasant sort, as is the
chief engineer, seated on my left. Working extremely hard, I steer the
conversation clear of anything to do with engines. Plates come and go. The
long night unfolds. Absent-mindedly, I place my napkin on the table and roll
it about a bit, teasing the loose ends into a crest-fallen bird-of-paradise.
DAY 2
Still at sea. The fun continues, though I am now seeking out the ship's
quiet places so as to avoid the many ways to spend money that the Westward
offers. Diving classes. Shopping arcade. Casino Royale. Beauty salon.
NCL claims to have pioneered Caribbean cruising in the mid-1960s by offering
cruises out of Miami, then a minor passenger port, on the 11,000-ton
Sunward. Today NCL has seven cruise ships (two more are on the way),
including the Norway (formerly the France, the world's largest passenger
ship), all of which cruise the Caribbean or the Mexican coast.
Built in 1972, the Westward is spacious and comfortable. She can take 821
passengers, though on this cruise there are 464, including 429 Americans.
There is no side to these people. They are Middle America on holiday:
whey-faced from their winters in Iowa, Idaho, Nebraska and New Jersey;
elderly, mostly; unblinkingly Republican and doggedly unsophisticated. If
you want to know how to save 12 cents on the dollar, these are the folk who
will show you how.
DAY 3
Our first port of call: Cabo San Lucas, famous for sports-fishing and
first-rate beaches. As I stroll around the marina, a salesman accosts me:
'Hi there, Sir. Is this your first visit to Cabo San Lucas? What I'm gonna
do is fill in this VIP card which entitles you to a tour of Dreamscape
Condominiums. Only take an hour, Sir. Then, when you're through, I'm going
to give you a Dollars 15 voucher entitling you to dinner at this real nice
place - seafood, prime rib, the best joint in Cabo - just around the corner.
Isn't that great, hey? Hey, man? Sir?'
Back on board the Westward, I glance across at a Russian cruise ship,
registered Odessa, riding at anchor. Its crew has not seen home for almost a
year and is said to be apprehensive.
By coincidence, I am reading the last pages of John le Carres The Secret
Pilgrim, the bit where George Smiley is ruminating on the new world order.
'One day,' says Smiley, 'history may tell us who really won. If a democratic
Russia emerges - why then, Russia will have been the winner. And if the West
chokes on its own materialism, then the West may still turn out to have been
the loser. But . . . sometimes there are no winners at all. And sometimes
nobody needs to lose.'
When I look up again, the Russian ship has stolen from port. All I can see
is pelicans diving.
DAY 4
Mazatlan. The weather is now brilliant, the temperature nudging 80. Thirteen
miles south of the Tropic of Cancer, Mazatlan is billed as the busiest port
on Mexico's west coast and the first big tourist resort south of the border.
Like Hawaii, it is losing the battle against US tourism, which grinds
everything it encounters into popcorn and concrete.
There is one compensation, though. 'Mazatlan,' my driver tells me, 'is
famous for the beauty of its women, who win Miss Mexico more often than
not.' I am sure he is right. There are beauties on every hand, smouldering
and pouting. Then I see a beggar-girl, with black worried eyes. I give her
Dollars 5. She takes the note solemnly, inspects it, folds it, smiles like a
queen. I hope she wins Miss Mexico.
Back on board, on my way to dinner, I see a fellow resident of Biscayne deck
lolling in a chair by the elevator. Although the dress code tonight is
formal, he is wearing purple shorts and his shirt sags open. He is holding,
with both hands, an enormous pink cocktail in which things look to be
swimming.
I ask him if he has cruised before. Yes, he says, this is his fourth cruise
in five years. 'Plus I had a side trip to Acapuk . . . Asapl . . .
Acasapulco, Goddammit. I just can't stop travell'n'
DAY 5 and 6
The weather is getting hotter and the ports of call more exotic: Puerto
Vallarta, where John Huston filmed The Night of the Iguana, and Zihuatanejo,
a wonderfully sleepy spot which I am sorry to leave.
On board the Westward, the pace of life intensifies. The giftshop is now
offering Brazilian amethysts and blue topazes at 'Dollars 10 only per
carat.' According to the giftshop: 'Stones are offered in a variety of carat
sizes to enable accessorizing pendants, rings and matching earrings.' It
takes me such a long time to fathom that sentence that by the time I do, the
Westward has shucked anchor once more and a gold and vermilion sunset is
burning the sea.
DAY 7
Acapulco, the end of the cruise.
Before leaving the ship, I made a point of poking into various suites and
penthouses, because my own cabin was only Category 8. For this cruise and
cabin category, NCL's 1992 UK prices range from Pounds 1,810 (low season) to
Pounds 1,887 (peak) for a two-week holiday that includes a seven-night stay
at the Marina Del Rey Marriott Hotel, Los Angeles, as well as the
seven-night cruise on the Westward, LA-Acapulco or Acapulco-LA. The cheapest
cabins cost Pounds 1,490-Pounds 1,568, while suites and penthouses range to
Pounds 2,401-Pounds 2,512. Fares are per person based on double occupancy.
The price includes economy scheduled transatlantic flights, the flight
between LA and Acapulco, port and airport taxes, all meals and entertainment
on board, all transfers and a one-day pass to Universal Studios, Hollywood.
NCL also says it can organise a week's car hire in LA (unlimited mileage)
from Pounds 110. Not included in the overall price are: holiday insurance,
hotel meals, gratuities, tours and shore excursions. The suggested
ship-board gratuities for the cabin steward, waiter, busboy and maitre d'
total Dollars 59.50 for a week's cruise.
If you are visiting LA anyway, the peak-season cruise-only fare for Category
8 cabins (north- or south-bound) is Dollars 1,770 plus port tax of Dollars
65, ranging to Dollars 2,895 plus port tax for the top-priced penthouse.
On my last night on board, I jotted down scores out of ten for various
aspects of my week's cruise on the Westward. They worked out like this:
ports of call, 8; weather (second week of February), 9; cabin, 7; cruise
staff, 8; ambience and entertainments, 7; food (which caters to American
tastes and quantities), 4; value for money, 7 1/2 . The way I score, that is
pretty good going.
Michael Thompson-Noel was a guest of Norwegian Cruise Line, and flew to Los
Angeles c/o American Airlines. In the UK, NCL is at Brook House, 229/243

FT  29 FEB 92 / Travel: Strange beauty of a stark land - The fragile, cruel
desert of the Skeleton Coast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARTS of Namibia's Skeleton Coast are so ecologically fragile that Land
Rover tracks take hundreds of years to heal. In the desert heat a discarded
banana peel does not rot, but shrivels and ossifies.
If man's presence threatens to scar the region, the Skeleton Coast pays back
in kind. The area owes its name to the innumerable shipwrecked sailors who
lost their way in milky Atlantic fogs and found themselves abandoned to the
grit of the great Namib desert. Bleached bones and hulks of galleons bear
witness to their fate.
These days the area is a national park, a sliver of coastline stretching
hundreds of miles from Cape Cross to the Angolan border. The northern
section has been declared a wilderness area; not a road, not a house, not a
car nor a train disturbs its bleak silence.
On my visit I flew with Louw Schoeman, the region's sole concessionaire and
self-appointed environmental guardian. To do so is to join a privileged set
comprising only a few hundred people a year. Our group of eight left
Windhoek's Eros airport in two light aircraft early one April morning. The
first aircraft was piloted by Schoeman himself, a weatherbeaten Afrikaner
with a mellifluous voice, silvery hair and a grey moustache. The second was
flown by his son, Bertus, a shy geologist.
The flight to the desert base camp took three hours - ample time to
contemplate the vastness of this arid country, four times the size of
Britain but home to only 1.4m people. It is so large that an airport built
in 1966 outside Windhoek has been lost. When a local gliding club asked for
permission to land there, the authorities denied its existence.
Bertus rarely flew higher than a few hundred feet and often considerably
lower. When he spied the strange Welwitschia mirabilis, he banked the
aircraft sharply and swooped so low I thought I saw insects crawling over
the plant's leathery leaves.
This living fossil grows only two huge leaves in a life that spans hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of years. It crawls from the baked earth like some
surreal spider and sustains itself, like so many plants on the Skeleton
Coast, from the moisture borne by the daily fogs.
We refuelled at the resort of Swakopmund before following the coast north.
As our aircraft buzzed along, Bertus casually served up a series of stunning
sights.
There were lurid purple and pink salt pans; thousands of flamingos which
scattered in a tumult of wings, beaks and legs; a colony of 120,000 seals
lined up along the shore at Cape Cross.
We landed at Sarusas camp, some 20km inland, on a strip so rough it was
almost indistinguishable from the surrounding terrain. Sarusas is the oldest
of Louw's four camps. It comprises a handful of deluxe tents, a solar-heated
shower unit and a wooden trestle table set beneath one of the region's rare
trees. The aim is to keep the camp as unobtrusive as possible, Louw's
philosophy being, as he solemnly puts it, 'to bring nothing to the desert
and to take nothing away.'
The old Afrikaner has an infectious enthusiasm for the desert. Several times
we found him lying on his stomach peering at the sand through a magnifying
glass. This rather undignified exercise revealed, quite miraculously, grains
of blue, green, red, white, black and yellow sand like a collection of
costume jewellery.
On other occasions, Louw would thrust his wooden walking stick at points of
interest. In this way he indicated the sandy covering to the trap-door
spider's lair, the dust-dry lichens that bloomed into flower on contact with
water, the tracks of the brown-backed hyena and the stone circles that may
long ago have been bushmen's huts.
We made trips by Land Rover, across the desert's pancake-flat plains or over
its stark lava rocks. It was on one such occasion that we came upon the
'roaring dunes.'
The Namib is scattered with all types of dunes. Some of them march (up to 15
metres a year), some are streaked blood-red with garnet, some are
mountainous. Only the roaring dunes roar.
At first, the sight of Louw sliding down the near-sheer surface of the sandy
crest caused me some bewilderment. But, as he disappeared far below, the
ground started to buzz, hum and finally to thunder. It was like the roar of
B-52 bombers rumbling overhead. The friction between the bone-dry grains of
sand was being amplified in the sickle-shaped dune as though the rim of a
giant wine glass was being rubbed by an unseen hand.
The roaring dunes were not the only wonder of the world's oldest desert.
There were also the 'waterfalls' of pure sand, the desert zebra which
somehow eked out an existence and the yellowish clay 'temples' of the
Hoarusib canyon.
The latter, formed perhaps 30,000 years ago from the silt deposits of a
long-dried-up river, had an extraordinary man-made quality. Many were
symmetrical pharaonic-type structures; others took on the shapes of huge
stone heads, fortresses with yawning doors and windows, or columned palaces
with gargoyles leering over balustrades of clay.
It gave the eerie impression that this was some long-abandoned city or that
hidden inhabitants were peering at us from the cavernous interiors of its
gargantuan structures.
Louw maintained this level of spectacle on each of our five days in the
desert. We flew to two further camps, one on the ghostly coast at Cape Frio,
the second perched above the black Kunene river which glimmered like sheet
metal as the sun set over the Angolan border.
Once Louw flew us to meet some of the Himba cattle herders involved in his
conservation efforts. The region used to be home to many desert elephant and
rhino but most were butchered during Namibia's civil war. Now numbers are
slowly beginning to recover.
The Himba, whom Louw pays to elect game wardens, have lived an isolated
nomadic existence for centuries. When they came into contact with whites
last century, some adopted Victorian dress which they have worn ever since.
Others did not change their customs, but continued to coat their naked
bodies in a beautifying and protective red dye.
We were introduced to two Himba women in Purros village. One wore a frilly
Victorian dress with layers of petticoats covering her ankles. She showed
not the slightest embarrassment as her naked friend smeared her own breasts
with a reddish paste of goat fat in front of eight leering foreigners.
As we pulled into the air for our return journey to Windhoek, the immensity
of the desert, inconceivable from the ground, again became apparent. The
bulging lava flows, endless plains of black sand and interlayered rock bore
out the bushmen's description of 'the land God made in anger.' Anger must
have been one of God's most spectacular and creative moods.
David Pilling travelled c/o Art of Travel (071-738-2038) in conjunction with
Windhoek-based Skeleton Coast Fly-in Safaris. Art of Travel organises
tailor-made holidays to Africa. The eight-day trip, including scheduled
flights on BA/Namib Air and two nights' accommodation in Windhoek, cost
Pounds 1,770. The company is also organising two group holidays to the

incorporating Etosha national park and Sossusvlei dunes.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Travel: A reinvented city that lives on in dreams - Modern
Alexandria is hopelessly dilapidated, crowded, and decaying. But, it can
still be a place of wonder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'For the majority of people, Alexandria was a dull hole with only good
bathing and many French restaurants to recommend it. 'There is nothing to
see]' they repeated endlessly, and this, too, was true' - Lawrence Durrell
on Alexandria of the 1940s.
THERE was nothing to see then, and there is nothing to see now. Today, even
the French restaurants and good bathing have all but disappeared. The city
hugs the shoreline, a linear sprawl of shabby dilapidation squeezed between
the desert and the sea. Its greatest age, when its philosophy, religion and
science made it the heart of the Hellenic world, lies buried under 2,000
years of urban detritus.
Alexandria's memory is hardly that long: palaces and villas, the vestiges of
an elegance lost earlier this century, sit forsaken and disintegrating among
a swirl of anonymous bazaar crowds oblivious of their existence. It is a
city of ruins, of old colonial ruins and over-crowded ruins jerry-built just
yesterday; of cracked concrete and peeling paint; of rising damp below and
tangled festoons of telephone lines and drying laundry above. It is a city
of desperate rural migration, shabby Egyptian holiday-making and stop-gap
civic management. It is a place of some pathos but no obvious appeal.
To anyone with romantic notions of Antony and Cleopatra, the library of
500,000 scrolls or that wonder of the ancient world, the 400 ft-tall Pharos
lighthouse, it is all, of course, a great disappointment. This was the city
that for centuries acted as a spiritual bridge between two continents; a
place where a dozen races met and mingled; a seat of urbanity and
eclecticism, intellectual synthesis and knowledge. For most visitors, it is
now a decaying, forgotten backwater.
Where is the tomb of Alexander the Great, the city's founder? I asked not
long after arriving. Nobody knew. Eventually, with the help of EM Forster's
Alexandria - published 70 years ago and the last guide to be written on the
city - I made my way to the intersection of rue Fuad and Nabi Daniel. If
Alexander's tomb ever existed there, it has disappeared in a thundering of
traffic and a puff of diesel smoke.
Even 70 years ago, Alexandria was what it had been in the beginning: a
Mediterranean city looking northwards across the sea to Europe. Today, it is
Arab - al-Iskandariya, a heavily-populated, industrialised African city. If
it looks anywhere for inspiration, it is southwards across the desert to
Cairo and, further, to Mecca. But even 70 years ago, long before Nasser's
socialist revolution, before nationalisations and expulsions drove 150,000
Europeans away, Alexandria was far from being the romantic city of popular
conception.
Forster lived in and wrote about Alexandria only because World War One
caught him there on his way to India. A generation later, Durrell also
pitched up, fleeing the German invasion of his beloved Greece. Both found
the city a hopelessly dull and bourgeois place.
'One can't dislike Alex,' Forster wrote, 'because it is impossible to
dislike sea and stones.' Durrell begged to differ; he described it as 'a
smashed-up, broken-down, shabby Neapolitan town, a saturated,
middle-European boredom laced with drink and Packards and beach cabins. No
subject of conversation except money.'
Yet, from the life of the city, both men extracted a flavour, a hint of some
inner being, that allowed each to recreate Alexandria in his own manner. In
his guide, Forster brought back to life a classical, ancient city of which
no sign had remained.
More important, Alexandria was literally his 'passage to India,' the city
where experiences ranging from philosophical debate with the Alexandrian
poet CP Cavafy to a love affair with a tram conductor formed his outlook on
the meeting of east and west. And as uninspiring as Durrell might have found
the place, there was something there that allowed for its transformation
into the dreamy, lyrical city of his Alexandria Quartet.
What was it? The answer is not to be found in Alexandria's sagging
tenements, its refuse-littered streets or horn-blaring traffic. It is not to
be found in any material aspect of the city at all but, instead, in the
spirit and imagination of those Alexandrians who remain aware of its past.
So great is its weight of history that, for them, a second, grander city,
insubstantial and ghost-like, rises out of the visible city's decay and
neglect. To see it, you have only to look through the eyes of Alexandrians
who, despite the evidence before their eyes, continue each day to re-invent
the place.
* * *
Although now less and less common, such people can be found in the most
ordinary of places. Shahira, for example, grew up in a land-owning family
which, in pre-Nasser days, claimed large Nile delta tracts and feudal
ownership of entire villages. Wealthy and educated, equally proud of her
Arab traditions and cosmopolitan upbringing, she might do anything with her
life.
What she chooses to do much of the time is hunt around in junk and
second-hand furniture shops. There, surrounded by an age that no longer
exists, she finds objects of beauty and brings them back to the present. It
is her way, perhaps, of slowing the ebb of time.
In an old shop off the Sharia El Hurriya, I watched Shahira digging about in
a room stuffed with sagging bedsprings, chipped china dogs, veneer-peeled
armoirs and broken typewriters; along with a hundred other things, they
imitated the larger life of the run-down, limp-along city outside. No-one, I
thought, could find anything of value here.
But, from under a battered metal table, Shahira hauled out a straight-backed
chair. Covered in grime, its upholstery ripped, it was old and once valued,
a stray heirloom that spoke for the existence of another Alexandria. For
Shahira, its restoration would be the building of another bulwark against
the slippage of time.
Inspired, I took to spending rainy afternoons in the city's antique shops.
In bronze statues, ormolu clocks, ivory canes and gilt-framed mirrors I met
the lingering spirits of Alexandria's past.
* * *
Like Shahira, Christina is another backwards-looking visionary. She takes
her place every day behind the cash register at the Cafe Elite, one of the
community of expatriates to whom those sad antiques once belonged.
Alexandria is no longer the Paris of the east but, like an antique itself,
the Elite hangs on unchanged, a fading Gallic outpost for a demi-monde that
no longer exists.
Christina sat me down, had a cream pastry brought and, in polished French,
recounted the visits of Piaf, Josephine Baker and others who once visited
the Elite. For Christina, the elegant theatre crowds might have left only
the evening before. She sees them still: the Greek and Italian cotton
brokers, the English shipping agents, the Levantine factory-owners, the
socialites, cafe philosophers and sybarites of a score of nations.
Alexandria was, for all, a summer idyll that would last forever.
No one questioned the villas, the servants, garden parties, idle promenades,
fashionable clothes, private schools. Not even Christina, daughter of a
Greek shopkeeper, questioned ancient Greek and Latin at the Lycee Francaise.
Why should she? Even the shabbiest of quayside cafe waiters served up coffee
and small talk in the languages of three continents. Now, her schoolmates
are gone, scattered to the ends of the earth. Like a handful of others
Christina stays on, her head full of the cabaret songs of her youth. It is
too late now, she says, to go anywhere else.
* * *
Mohammed, too, knows phantom Alexandria. An architect, he has welded his own
life to the life of the city. He is a distillation of its past, a product of
marriages between Greek and Egyptian grandparents, a Moslem who attended a
Christian school, an African who borrows ideas and attitudes from around the
world.
He is forever busy with a dozen projects, but it is no accident that his
greatest sense of architectural duty lies in preserving Alexandria's old
buildings. In attempting to save them from decay and destruction, he sees
some way of saving himself.
I met Mohammed for dinner one night in a restaurant overlooking Stanley Bay,
on the sea-front Corniche. The meal lasted until midnight, the talk very
much longer. The real Alexandria, he wanted to convince me, is not so very
far removed from the Alexandria of the imagination. At 2am, we set out so I
could see for myself.
Perhaps it all worked because no city seems entirely real at that time of
night. We drove through silent, deserted streets half-lit by weak and
occasional lamp standards. The crowds, the noise, the grime, the
distractions had disappeared.
In the dark, modern Egypt was minimised - the kebab shops, bazaar stalls,
rubble heaps and weary housing blocks faded into obscurity. What emerged
from the gloom in their place, animated by Mohammed's vision and enthusiasm,
were a thousand splendid faces from Alexandria's past.
We gazed at formal Italianate residences, their facades, dirty and blotched
by day, now new and unsullied again under the obscuring cover of night. We
drove past fussy neo-Gothic follies, around the smooth rotundities of art
deco villas, under the complex wrought ironwork of art nouveau - all
repaired by the night's blurring sleight-of-hand.
Porticoes, pediments, columns, caryatids, pilasters, friezes - across the
city, darkness smoothed over the damage time had done them. Alexandria was
given new life.
Finally, very late, in the old Jewish quarter of Moharem Bey, we stopped
outside a house. A chain and padlock held together a rusty iron gate.
Inside, I could make out neglected and un-pruned date trees, a sweeping
stairway overgrown with creepers, a tiled balcony where dead leaves swirled
in the night wind. Behind rose a dark house and tall tower. What is it? I
asked Mohammed as he switched off the ignition. Durrell's old place, he
replied. We sat gazing at the house for a long moment.
Durrell, of course, was not telling the whole truth - no artificer does.
Ignore the bathing, the French restaurants and the other blowsy attractions
and there is plenty to see in this city. Of phantom Alexandria, you make
what you will.

Pick, is now available in paperback (John Murray, London, Pounds 11.95).

FT  29 FEB 92 / Gardening: Cyclamen need friends, too - Trawling the
Mediterranean world for attractive varieties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley, Surrey, will today host
an open day for cyclamen. Starting at 11.30, visitors will have a chance to
see many of the best wild forms in full flower or leaf. You can buy young
plants and also join the Cyclamen Society (otherwise based at Tile Barn
House, Iden Green, Benenden, Kent.)
Cyclamen need friends, not just because the many wild forms are such
wonderful plants outdoors and in pots. In the wild, they are also being
stripped and collected ruthlessly.
The numbers of cyclamen being pulled up for the trade has risen vertically
in the wake of new botanical discoveries. It might seem incredible, but new
species are continuing to be found in areas travelled as widely as western
and southern Turkey.
Two new forms have turned up in the past 20 years, one of which is
especially noteworthy. Called Mirabile, this lovely form shows its pink
flowers and toothed leaves in September, and looks like a graceful variation
on the better-known Cilician variety. Luckily, it is proving to be hardy in
British gardens, although its small flowers are also happy in a pot in an
unheated greenhouse.
No sooner had gardeners woken up to it than enthusiastic Turks began to
bring it to the market in quantity. I have heard and seen amazing stories -
how peasants in the pine woods are paid piece-rates to lob tubers of
newly-wanted Mirabile into baskets; how casual labour bussed-in from the
East for cotton-picking has been turned loose on this new plant for the west
European trade.
Naturally, respectable growers, nurserymen and society members grow cyclamen
only from seed raised from their stock plants in captivity. Not so the
egregious Turk to whom I was introduced some while ago in Izmir. Wild
flowers, he told me, were the crop of the future; he went south every year
to organise 'harvesting.' But did I think there would also be a market for
snowdrops, which he had located by the thousand in woods near the Black Sea?
When amateur growers gather together, everyone has a horror story from the
wild. I must emphasise that no good nursery would ever knowingly offer
mass-collected stock; but accidents can happen and rules can be broken
because of intermediaries who have bought from Turkey and sold quietly to
the wholesale trade.
So: where to buy safe stock, and which varieties should you choose for the
greatest pleasure?
The expert firm of Potterton and Martin issues lists from Nettleton,
Caistor, Lincolnshire, and sells cyclamen as growing plants in pots. The
present list runs to nearly 30 varieties which would otherwise be local to
Libya, Cyprus or the Lebanon. They are raised within the trade, not imported
from the wild, and make the most rewarding presents for anyone whose
greenhouse is not heated.
Under glass, wild cyclamen can take you right round the calendar, flowering
in almost every month and outperforming almost any other indoor plant. When
gardens are banned in due course for being cruel to weeds, I will pot-up my
10 best varieties and withdraw them indoors to an unheated window sill.
In catalogues or at Wisley, watch out for the splendid Lebanese cyclamen.
This is not really hardy outdoors but grows easily in a shallow pan of leafy
soil that just covers the tuber. Cyclamen libanoticum is in full flower this
week and its clear pink flowers are large by the standards of a wild
variety. Soon, the wild persicum form will take over, flowering after the
leaves have faded and reminding you of qualities which breeders have lost in
their florist varieties. Persicum is scented sweetly and its small petals
are reflexed - like Piglet's ears in a high wind, in Ernest Shepherd's
drawings. Plants cost up to Pounds 3, but are grown easily and last for
years.
Outdoors, we are blessed at the moment with the remarkable coum, a totally
hardy variety with a white form available separately from Potterton and
Martin. Soon, it will be the turn of repandum, which runs wild from Turkey
to the south of France; then, there will be the neglected purpurascens,
which I have seen in hundreds during summer in north Italy.
Autumn brings the best of all: Naples cyclamen, abundant all over the
Mediterranean - except in Naples. All of these forms are among the hardiest
and are amazingly easy to establish if you buy them growing in pots. Dry
tubers are a false economy and their origins are sometimes rather dubious.
Absurdly, the thousands of plants which have been dug up, dried and re-sold
into the trade have had the least chance of survival in gardens. Proper
nurseries sell stock which damages nobody and is raised in cultivation. I
would never garden without them, and this weekend is a chance for Wisley
visitors to see how many more small varieties have been isolated, named, and
brought to our attention.

This is a snowdrop and, if I were confined to one variety only, this is the
one I would choose because it spread rapidly into fine colonies and it has
very fine flowers on long stems. Curiously, it produces no seeds and its
rapid increase is due to bulb multiplication, which means that it shows no
variation at all, but is always of the same uniform quality. It flowers in
February and early March, prefers semi-shaded places, but will grow in full
sun and is best planted immediately after flowering, when it can be lifted
with soil around its roots, divided into small clusters of bulbs and
replanted as soon as possible.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Gardening: Grown in the glory of youth - For best-blooming
summers, Arthur Hellyer recommends the old-fashioned way of pruning roses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROSE world has seen some strange goings-on recently. Serious people have
been pruning them with power-driven hedge-trimmers, mowing them off at a
level height above the ground. Surprisingly, the pruners report that these
roses have grown and flowered excellently.
If that is true, why bother with all the finer points of officially-approved
pruning? That includes the preliminary removal of all dead, badly-damaged or
diseased growth, plus very thin stems; and the subsequent shortening of good
growth according to its strength and the precise purpose for which the rose
is required.
I think it is premature to throw away the pruning instructions and bring out
the hedge trimmers. For, when you think about it, you would expect good
results for a year or so from the sort of indiscriminate hard pruning that
hedge-trimmers would give you. The point about roses of nearly all kinds -
especially the garden hybrids that have been bred to flower freely and in
succession for much of the summer - is that they thrive on young growth.
They must have a plentiful supply of it and, in the short term, the most
certain way to get this is to cut everything down hard.
The sap pumped up by the roots is concentrated on far fewer buds than there
would be otherwise. The result is vigorous growth with, in the case of all
repeat-flowering varieties, a good second (and even possibly a third) flush
of flowers.
I would expect this to continue for two or three years with hedge-trimmer
pruning, but it would be a policy of diminishing returns. This all-over
pruning at one height, irrespective of type of growth, would result in a
gradual accumulation of dead and dying stems.
This is much the way roses live in the wild. They allow their old stems to
die, caring not at all how unsightly they look; and if they get diseased,
that also is permitted to take its natural course.
There is a lot of renewal from sucker growth coming direct from the roots,
but few garden roses are grown on their own roots from seedlings, cuttings
or layers. Instead, they are increased by budding, which is a particularly
economical form of grafting; and the roses that are chosen to provide the
roots are of a different kind from the garden roses that are budded on them.
Below ground, these root stocks need to be encouraged by every means
possible. Above ground, they must be suppressed totally by being cut out
close to the roots from which they grow - and as soon as they are seen.
None of this would be managed by hedge-trimmer pruning. On the contrary, it
would be aggravated, because the root stocks are almost always
stronger-growing species of rose than the garden varieties grown on them.
Thus, when all kinds of growth are cut back equally, it is the root stocks
that will multiply with greatest freedom and vigour.
I would agree, however, that some of the refinements of pruning, as
practised by specialists, may be part of the fun of growing roses rather
than an absolute necessity. You could state a general principle that, the
more vigorous roses are by nature, the less detailed pruning they require.
Most shrub roses, such as Fritz Nobis, Nevada and Kassall, can simply be
thinned, concentrating on the removal of dead, dying and diseased growth
which is easy enough to identify by its appearance. If the bushes are
cleaned-up only every few years, it can become quite a time-consuming task;
but if it is done annually, it should not be nearly so difficult.
With bush roses, pruning usually is done in February or March when the
growth buds are swelling and can be identified easily. Ideally, all cuts
should be made just above a growth bud from which it is hoped a new stem
will grow. But Then look over rose bushes later in the spring, when they are
growing freely, and shorten any shoot ends which have no new growing tips.
They should be cut back to the topmost point at which there is a shoot or a
good growth bud. If there is neither, that stem may be removed altogether,
since it is of no use to the plant.
Climbing roses divide broadly into two groups: the rambler or very vigorous
type, such as New Dawn, which makes a lot of long stems from near the base
(or, at any rate, from fairly low down); and the less-vigorous climbing or
pillar roses, which make most of their new growth from partway up the old
stems.
With the vigorous type it usually is possible to cut out many of the old
flowering stems when the flowers have faded in summer or autumn and to train
the new, non-flowering stems in their place. With the climbing type, it is
really a repeat of the pruning applied to bush and shrub roses: cut out dead
and diseased stems, tie-in good growth, and then remove as many of the older
but still healthy stems as can be spared. 'Roses thrive on youth' is the
motto you should bear in mind with pruning.

FT  29 FEB 92 / The true believers still in thrall to Stalin's ghost: The
veteran communists who can only wring their hands in anguish as their dreams
and their country crumble around them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHON COHEN

<TEXT>
FOR Grigori Khazanov, the past is suddenly a foreign country where things
were done differently. Almost 80 and a Communist Party functionary for most
of his life, his views are now deeply unfashionable. 'We believed, we
believed in Stalin and in a shining future. We believed in progress.'
Now, following the break-up of the Union, he and thousands of others find
themselves in a land without history; a land stripped of the past they
strove to create. They look back on 74 years of wasted endeavour. And amid
the chaos of the disintegrating monolith, and in the face of market forces,
the past has assumed a rose-tinted glow.
It is easy to forget those who battled to build communism, to build a state
in which the workers would be respected. Khazanov and his contemporaries
regret not just their faded youth but also that of their country. For them a
past perceived as radiant is counterposed by a bleak present. The vortex of
decay in which the Russian economy is spiralling is a bitter hardship for
the elderly.
Communism's capitulation might offer new opportunities. But for those who
lived through the Stalin revolution and the consequent social
transformation, and who weathered the storm of Nazi invasion, it is the
evaporation of a dream, of the beliefs of a lifetime. They now live off
meagre pensions and represent an estranged element in society. 'Time will
tell, the wheel will turn, we'll fight on,' says Khazanov, clinging to a
faltering belief.
Many elderly people mourn not only the demise of the Soviet Union but are
also pained by the scorn poured on the years of Stalin. Many remain ardent
Stalinists, though adoration of Stalin was a fraught compound of love and
fear.
Stalin's years were those of their prime. Appalling hardships there were,
millions suffered and died under a cruelly oppressive system. But others
prospered. This was a period of dramatic social mobility, when peasants'
children became industrial managers or high-flying party functionaries.
Above all there was idealism. People shared a common purpose. The society
they had a role in building was lauded as a new stage of human civilisation,
bestowing an aura of promise upon the period. Wartime triumph bolstered
this. By 1945 the Soviet Union had emerged as a world power.
Current events are a barbed disillusionment, piercing their hearts in old
age. This forlorn generation present the most visible sign of a society in
shock, although bewilderment at the rate and depth of change reaches far
beyond it. After six years of Gorbachev and perestroika this is not a
society only now throwing off the cobwebs of isolation. Outside influences
have become increasingly apparent. But influence is not the same as a
sea-change. The realignment of a society, from communism to the market, is a
baffling experience for those caught within it. Assumptions ingrained since
childhood, for old and young, are being overturned.
Coming to terms with the break-up of the Union demands a psychological step
of the imagination which is too great an emotional exertion for many in
their twilight years. Victory in 1945 instilled a sense of worth in people
like Khazanov, but this is now on the verge of crumbling: 'I am offended to
tears, insulted that the young think it would have been better to lose the
war, as if we would all be driving Mercedes now.'
Khazanov's bitterness is not directed at the past, though he admits that
Stalin made mistakes, but rather at those he labels the 'democratic
usurpers,' in the driving seat since last August's failed coup.
Incomprehension is common among Khazanov's generation. Words such as
'insult' and 'offence' have become common currency. Nikolai Rekhovskii, now
67 and going deaf but once a wartime bomber pilot, finds it hard to believe
that everything has been given away. 'It is wild' he said. 'After the war we
rebuilt everything in five or six years, and now it has taken only five or
six years of perestroika to destroy it.'
Like many others he wonders how a country overflowing with resources can be
begging for aid. 'It is not as if we lived that much better before, but we
weren't offended and we didn't feel resentment.' The economic strain of the
post-war years was endured against a psychologically positive background.
Progress was in the air and from the 1950s living standards clearly rose.
But now the country's self confidence has been humbled. 'Everyone moans
today, but things were far worse before' says Lev Karpov, a 67-year-old
ex-infantryman. He recalls a pre-war adolescence in which he shared a
four-room flat of 40 sq metres meters with 17 others. He and his brother had
the kitchen table for a bed. He grins with childish zest as he looks at his
two-roomed, 30 sq metre meters flat in which he lives with wife and
daughter, and announces: 'This is progress.'
Progress indeed, but Karpov's pride is laced with despondency: 'We thought
it would be better and better, and it was. But its a nightmare now, chaos. I
don't even know in which country I'm living. My heart boils when I think of
the Union falling to pieces. I used to have a motherland, now I have
nothing. It's a nightmare.' Nightmare, chaos, awful - the refrain of a
generation left in shock.
The sense of betrayal among wartime veterans is deep-rooted. In December,
Moscow marked the 50th anniversary of its defence against German forces in
1941. The celebrations were intended to culminate with festivities in the
central Manezh Square. But instead it produced an event of comic proportions
which could only ridicule the cherished memory of victory.
In the chilling cold, few people showed up. Vladimir Ponomarev, however,
came from Ukraine to commemorate the victory in which he had fought as a
teenager. The incongruity of the event was matched by its music. One moment
a military band was blasting marching songs, the next a loud hailer boomed
Tutti Frutti. With snow drifting past our eyes and Little Richard blaring
out, Ponomarev commented: 'Business is for the young, not for me. I believed
in socialism and I am too old to change. It is difficult to embrace what you
were brought up to detest.'
During the celebrations many veterans had gathered to reminisce. At a
partisan meeting, 69-year-old Nikolai Toloraya took the podium to make an
impromptu speech. He thundered: 'We are enduring a terrible tragedy in our
motherland. We defended the capital of the Union, but what is happening now?
How can we stand by and the let republics go, see our monuments torn down
and our heroes abused?' The entire audience of 100 men and women, all of
whom had fought behind German lines in the winter of 1941-42, gave him the
loudest ovation of the day.
Toloraya knows exactly where to point his finger to find the origin of the
events which so dismay him. 'Perestroika and its ideology are guilty.
Gorbachev and Yeltsin are to blame. They want to go back to capitalism, but
we were brought up in the spirit of socialism, it's in our blood and we
lived in harmony.' No acknowledgement is made of the extent to which this
'harmony' was born of dictatorship.
Raised as a communist, Toloraya is quick to identify privatisation and price
rises as the source of disharmony. For him, the flip side of enterprise is
speculation. He was stunned to learn that students at Moscow State
University are now selling party cards, once the symbol of loyalty and
commitment, as a Dollars 10 souvenir to foreigners.
Disillusion is more easily expressed than solutions are conceived. Stalin's
iron fist retains attractions for many of the elderly - it represents a
period of order when they knew where they stood. Piotr Khazarian, a
diminutive man who shares a communal flat with an alcoholic whom he
despises, emphasises this: 'Our generation respect Stalin. You knew that if
you worked you would eat, and if you did not work, you wouldn't. We need
that discipline now.' A pin-up nude hangs on his wall, but it is accompanied
by Stalin's portrait, hanging as if in place of a crucifix above his bed.
Stalin's continuing attraction among people such as Toloraya and Khazarian
reveals a degree of schizophrenia common in many of this generation. It is a
condition born of ambiguity and confusion. Their formative years under
Stalin belong to a dark, repressive period, yet one of progress and
idealism. Having spent two years in a labour camp in the early 1950s, Lev
Karpov can still reflect: 'We lived a thousand times better under Stalin.'
His bewilderment derives from seeing years of toil squandered. The sense
that the rank and file have been deceived on an enormous scale, set adrift
by historical events and by a leadership primarily concerned with its own
comfort, is disorienting.
Karpov lost ten members of his family at the front during the war. Like so
many, with the Soviet Union no more, he now wonders what he fought for. That
he cries when he hears war songs is reflective of the emotional resonance
that the war still has. At a demonstration to condemn the break-up of the
Union, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a proto-fascist and the one political figure of
any renown prepared to air the sense of loss this generation feels, led the
500-strong crowd in singing the popular wartime verse: 'Arise great land,
Arise for the deadly battle, with the dark force of fascism, the accursed
horde ..'

FT  29 FEB 92 / Property: When tiny is best
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BRENNAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL FLATS in London are a delicate barometer of first-time buyers'
activity. According to Stern Studios, they also reveal some curious
sub-markets.
Stern deals exclusively in one-bedroom and studio flats, which have a much
more rapid turnover than average owner-occupied properties. Director Tom
Trudgian believes that the 'generally-accepted view that prices have fallen
by 25 per cent since 1988 is an under-estimate.' Examples of studio flats on
offer at one-third less than their 1988 sale price now seem nearer the mark.
Because most people must now pay the community charge (or poll tax) as
individuals, rather than collectively as with the old rating system, the use
of a pied-a-terre for family purposes has become less economic and interest
in that area of the small-flat market has declined seriously (although Stern
notes that a number of business buyers are opting for a flat rather than a
small office to use as a base, one reason being that poll tax is cheaper
than the unified business rate).
It is only among the tiniest properties that Stern finds a steady demand,
though. By 'tiniest,' think of a property of less than 100 sq feet, with no
kitchen and (probably) limited bathroom facilities. Stern calls these 'broom
cupboards'; often, they are partitioned out of a larger old property. (None
would get win planning permission as an individual home and, normally, they
cannot be mortgaged).
So why is there active demand to pay between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 30,000
for them? British Rail's erratic services seem to be one reason. Otherwise,
Stern says buyers want this kind of property in order to have a 'love nest';
to qualify for a resident's parking permit; as an accommodation or business
address; to rent out; or as a straightforward investment.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Property: Renters rally to plug gap caused by sales slump -
Assured tenancies have helped spur the London market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BRENNAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESIDENTIAL letting specialists have been smiling alongside their grim-faced
sales colleagues over the past two years. For the rental business has
largely been unaffected by the recession and demand has held up well.
The sharp fall in trading activity in the City, and heavy job losses at
international finance houses, has reduced the number of fresh-faced US
bankers leasing flats with money no object. On the other hand, more
international corporations have chosen London as their Euro-base in the
run-up to the integration of EC markets at the end of the year. The two
trends seem to have balanced each other out.
While even the most generous international corporations are tightening
budgets for executive accommodation overseas, the number of business renters
in London remains high. They are supplemented by an increasing number of
domestic tenants who are choosing to rent rather than buy.
Domestic renters, and more UK landlords, have been drawn back into this
market by the assured tenancies created in the 1988 Housing Act. The change
in the law enables landlords to charge open-market rents and to be certain
of recovering their property at the end of an agreed period.
Until the act, landlords renting flats and houses commercially were not
willing to accept an individual tenant who might, under existing
regulations, win a lifetime's security of tenure at an artificially low
'fair' rent.
Even with the new law, landlords initially were reluctant to let to anyone
other than a company. As Sammy Salama, of Plaza Estates, says: 'People were
a bit frightened of finding loopholes or some other problems with the
change, but it has been working fine.' The result is a choice that has not
been available to individual British households for half a century - a
realistic option to rent.
'We are seeing more people who sold before the crash who have done their
calculations. They can't see any appreciation if they buy now and they see
that they are better off renting and leaving their money on deposit,' says
Salama. 'The difference now is that whereas individual tenants were not
acceptable before, now they find they are treated like a customer and they
can pick and choose the properties they want.'
That choice of properties in London has been boosted by developer-owners
releasing unsold flats, and by a limited number of individuals offering
unsold houses and flats for rent. 'Many vendors who are reaching the end of
their tether with the sales market will now look to letting as a viable
option,' says Mary Ryan, of John D. Wood.
These amateur landlords do not necessarily make the best clients for the
letting agencies. As Ryan says, once it has been agreed to rent the family
home, it has to be available for a reasonable period.
'Vendors-turned-landlords must understand that tenants coming from abroad
will not be prepared to entertain release clauses that mean a landlord can
terminate just because he believes the sales market has picked up enough to
warrant another shot at selling,' Ryan stresses.
The most common corporate rental period in London is a year, with a
six-month 'break' clause. But only the most dedicated bargain-hunters
exercise that six-month option to shop around again. 'People always can
negotiate something off the rent if they try,' Salama says. 'It is a far cry
from the days when it was 'beggars can't be choosers,' with little choice of
properly-equipped flats.'
The savings are, however, likely to be marginal in a market where, as most
of the active letting agents agree, there are invisible - but nonetheless
effective - price bands.
In crude terms, central London rents for a single-bedroom or large studio
flat would be in the Pounds 200-400 a week range (a touch lower in the
Docklands of east London). The most active sector is for two-bedroom
apartments in the Pounds 300 to Pounds 500 bracket, while three- and
four-bedroom family houses range from Pounds 500-700 a week in good but
off-centre areas.
Rents for more-distinguished properties - those with a fashionable address
and the capacity to be a base for entertainment - race swiftly past Pounds
2,000 a week . Then, there is the rarified - and highly negotiable - sector
where people keep straight faces while asking rents of Pounds 5,000-8,000 a
week and more.
The most expensive rentals tend to be taken up by private visitors who
travel with a large retinue. Even at several thousand pounds a week, the
costs are likely to compare more than favorably with hotel suites. For the
travelling sheikh or the globe-trotting businessman, rental London can be a
deal cheaper than traditional lodging.
But these huge rentals account for only a small fraction of all letting. In
its most recent survey of the market, Hamptons found that the average weekly
rent for a professional letting in central London was Pounds 432. That was a
balance between averages as low as Pounds 170 in Docklands and more than
Pounds 800 in Belgravia, Knightsbridge and Mayfair.
American corporate tenants are the largest single group for many letting
agencies. Savills reports that an exceptional 87.5 per cent of rental deals
this year have been with US companies, with budgets mainly in the Pounds 500
to Pounds 1,000 a week range.
But Aylesford's autumn 1991 survey showed that UK and US renters accounted
for around one-third of the total each, with continental Europeans making up
much of the balance plus a sprinkling from the Far and Middle East and South
Africa. The records at Hamptons show a similar pattern. Clearly, views of
the market vary from agency to agency. At Vogue Rentals, Helene Silvestros
has found a sharper-than-average switch to domestic tenants. She notes:
'Only a few years ago, the market was dominated by foreign clients,
primarily American. However, that has changed with the lengthy recession.
Today, over half of all rentals are for English clients.'
Generally stable rents, at a time when capital values are continuing to
fall, mean that investment returns are rising. But what an investor might
expect to get in this market is debatable.
Some agents are talking about gross returns of 13 and 13.5 per cent -
sufficient to earn a double-figure net return after agency fees and
professional costs. Others report gross returns of 8 to 10 per cent -
impressive by past standards (when net returns of 4 to 5 per cent would have
been regarded as good) but paling alongside the premium yields. Buying makes
all the difference. Those premium yields are being won by investors using
all their cash power to pressurise the last pound of price reduction from
owners keen to sell.
London's stock of apartments for rent never has been so open to scavenger
bids; and even with some confusion about the effective rate of return on
such flats, the figures are proving enough to bring the buyers back.
Investors looking to the mid-1990s evidently believe that today's returns
offset the risk of further price cuts. Hong Kong residents and expatriates
have a five-year span in their minds as they look to the 1997 handover of
the colony to China.
Their recent buying in London confirms that they believe this is as good a
time as any to lay down some comparatively cheap property so they can take a
rental return that virtually covers financing costs but leaves enough time
to allow for a recovery in values.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Cookery: Pancakes that won't batter your ego
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE pancake splattered on the ceiling, one ego shattered on the floor. An
ignominious attempt at pancake-tossing has left an ugly mark on the ceiling
as a rueful reminder of my clumsiness. I am not so keen on pancakes now. All
the fun and excitement goes if you are condemned, as I am, to turning them
with tentative fingers and a spatula. So, I shall leave it to others to
show-off their pancake prowess on Shrove Tuesday. Instead, I shall turn my
hand to other batters - for I am traditional enough to want to indulge in
the time-honoured Shrovetide feasting on dairy produce before the Lenten
fast.
Drop, or dropped, scones sounds ominously like another disaster, but the
name means simply that these scones are made from a thick batter that is
dropped off the tip of a spoon on to a griddle for cooking. This
distinguishes them from the sort of scone that is made from a dough, rolled
out, stamped out with a cutter or upturned tea-cup, and baked.
My other recipe is for apple fritters, one of those old-fashioned puddings
which, while largely forgotten, is much too good to allow to fall from
memory completely. Like drop scones, it can be served in savoury ways as
well as sweet.
You might think it is sour grapes that prompts me to suggest that these
dishes will make a less hackneyed feast than pancakes for Shrove Tuesday,
but you will surely acknowledge that they win on speed. Pancakes have to be
cooked one by one; these can be cooked in batches. And the less time you
spend at the stove, the more time there is for celebratory eating.
COTTAGE DROP SCONES (makes about 15)
Cottage cheese is not an ingredient I use often - the associations with
dieters' salads are too grim - but here it is pure pleasure, used in place
of flour to make a tender and creamy light batter. Drop scones (also known
as Scotch pancakes) make a sizzling 4pm treat. They are just right for
tea-time visitors when there is no time to bake a cake - and are ready to
eat within minutes of thinking about making them.
Add a drop of orange flower water or a pinch of cinnamon to the batter for
fragrant variations on the theme. Flavoured like this, they can even be
served for dinner, teamed with creme fraiche and something fruity - say, the
pulp scooped from passion fruit, or home-made lemon curd, or spoonfuls of
Very Very Apricot (Elsenham's recently-launched runny, fruity and rather
superior jam-cum-sauce).
If you prefer something savoury, season the batter with salt, pepper and
perhaps a little spice. Top the hot, freshly-cooked scones with grilled
streaky bacon or a saute of chicken livers and mushrooms, or serve simply
dripping with butter and sprinkled with chopped fresh herbs or shavings of
Parmesan.
I plan to try making these drop scones using buckwheat flour when I think
they might make an agreeable alternative to blinis for serving with soured
cream and caviare (or smoked salmon, if funds will not run to caviare).
Ingredients: 2 oz self-raising flour (or 2 oz wholemeal flour plus  1/4 tsp
baking powder); 1 tablespoon caster sugar or a good seasoning of salt and
coarsely-ground black pepper; 1 oz butter at room temperature;  1/4 lb
cottage cheese; 2 large eggs; 2-3 tablespoons milk.
Method: Mix the flour (plus baking powder, if using it) and sugar or salt
and pepper. Add the butter and cottage cheese and whizz in a food processor
for a few seconds. Pour the lightly-beaten eggs through the spout while the
machine is running and continue whizzing until blended smoothly, adding the
milk as necessary to slacken the batter slightly.
Drop tablespoons of the batter on to a hot, lightly-buttered griddle or
heavy frying pan (three or four tablespoons spaced a little apart) and cook
over moderate heat until set to a golden brown underneath and bubbles foam
to the surface. If the heat is too high, they will burn. Flip them over and
cook briefly on the second side.
Keep the scones warm and tender in a low oven, wrapped between the folds of
a napkin, while you cook the rest and serve as soon as possible.
APPLE FRITTERS (serves 4-6)
These can be served very simply with quartered lemons and a dusting of
demerara sugar for crunch. Spice them up, if you will, with cinnamon sugar
or a grating of nutmeg. Or pull out all the stops and hand round a bowl of
whipped cream laced with calvados or English apple brandy.
For those more savoury-minded than sweet-toothed, the fritters can be served
in tandem with Wensleydale or Lancashire cheese. Or, instead of sugar and
lemon, flavour the batter with salt, pepper and rosemary, thyme or a few
bruised fennel seeds and serve the fritters as partners for pork meats:
grilled pork chops, gammon steaks or good old-fashioned sausages - a rich
and splendid combination.
Ingredients: 6 Coxes or other aromatic and not-too-sweet dessert apples; 1
lemon; 1 tablespoon caster sugar; 4 oz plain flour; 2 tablespoons melted
butter;  1/4 pt still dry cider or unsweetened apple juice; 2 egg whites.
Method: Grate the lemon zest finely and whizz it briefly in a food processor
together with the caster sugar and flour. Add the melted butter and cider or
apple juice, pouring them through the spout while the machine is running,
and continue processing until the batter is blended smoothly.
Peel and core the apples. Slice them into rings and rub with a cut lemon.
Whisk the egg whites to snowy peaks and fold them into the batter. Coat the
apple slices with batter (just a small handful at a time), shake off excess
and deep-fry in oil heated to 360`F (185`C) for four-five minutes or until
piping hot, golden brown and cooked through.
Drain well, keep hot in a single layer in the oven while you cook the rest,
and serve as soon as possible.

PRYCE &amp; Brise Antiques is a charming small shop in Fulham, west London, that
specialises in English antique glass, mainly Georgian and Victorian. There
are handsome celery vases, fine claret jugs and Georgian cut-glass port
decanters, all of which would make splendid presents. You could buy a
Bristol blue glass decanter for Pounds 180; a set of six green glasses,
dating from about 1820, for Pounds 430; an 1810 whisky decanter for Pounds
310; or a Victorian celery vase for about Pounds 50. One of those rare,
18th-century wine glasses with a colour twist stem could cost a few
thousand.
Pryce &amp; Brise found, however, that demand greatly outstripped supply in one
particular area - champagne flutes. The recession might be deep but
champagne-drinking, it appears, still goes on. So, Nella Pryce and Jan
Brise, the two women who own and run the shop, set about re-creating a
champagne flute from an original early-19th century design.
Made by hand and sold singly, in pairs or in boxed sets of four, the flutes
can be bought in more or less unlimited quantities. The result you can see
photographed here left.
They are sold singly at Pounds 28 or can be sent by mail in a boxed set of

THE DELAY over the opening of the Channel Tunnel and the closure of some
ferry services has somewhat muddied the waters we British have to cross for
our holidays abroad
As some compensation, the Automobile Association has just published a
concise guide to 27 car ferry services sailing from the UK to Northern
Ireland, Eire, Scandinavia, France, Holland, Germany and Spain, and rated
all their facilities and services on board. Top culinary marks are awarded
to vessels operated by Scandinavian Seaways to Denmark, Sweden and Germany,
the Olau Line to the Netherlands and to Brittany Ferries for their flagship
vessel, the Bretagne, on the route between Plymouth and Santander in
Northern Spain.
The guide is available free from all AA shops.

GERMANY imported 14.05m bottles of champagne last year and, for the first
time, became the biggest foreign buyer of this wine, dislodging the UK -
which had been Champagne's biggest customer for the previous five years - by
a mere 27,000 bottles.
But while even German imports were slightly down on 1990, Britain's were 34
per cent lower, in spite of a remarkable 2.7m bottles shipped to the UK in
December.
In view of the widespread stories of the collapse of champagne sales
everywhere, with a world total of ex-Marne sales of 120m bottles, this is
less than 10 per cent below 1990's total. Although the gap between last
year's vintage of 276m bottles will add to the stocks in Champagne's chalk
cellars, the extra age in bottle resulting should only be for the good.

LOVERS of Spanish food and cooking have never really been satisfied by the
offerings in Spanish restaurants in London. Many of the tapas bars which
opened in the 1980s have closed, Los Remos of W2, and Meson Don Felipe of
SE1 being honourable exceptions; of the restaurants, Galicia W10, Rebatos
SW8 and La Giralda in Pinner have been the most reliable and Pepe's is due
to open this month in Malvern Road, W9.
Meanwhile, the small firm of Brindisa in Crimscott Street, London SE1
(071-231-0016) has been quietly importing the best that only Spain can
offer: serrano ham hung for a minimum of nine months; chorizo sausage;
membrillo, the quince cheese; sherry vinegar and saffron. Two of their
cheeses are now in Safeway supermarkets, a blended manchego and a Majorcan
mahon, while more of their range is at Selfridge's, Harrods and Villandry in
London; The Flour Bag, Lechlade, Gloucestershire; and the Fine Cheese
Company in Bath. Within London Brindisa will now deliver reasonable orders
to your home twice a week as well as sending orders by post.

THE Rhone house of Chapoutier has been revolutionised by the brothers Marc
and Michel, who are still in their early 30s. By instituting organic methods
and shrinking yields, they are making exceptionally concentrated, serious
wines. Best value in Britain at the moment is their barrique-aged 1990
Rasteau, so spicy it tastes almost mulled, with its 20 per cent ration of
Mourvedre grapes. At Pounds 5.25 from Majestic it could be drunk now but
should reach its best in a year or two.

THE NEW Food Safety Act is forcing all professional food handlers back to
the classroom. What can never accurately be established, however, is just
how many cases of food poisoning or an upset stomach occur in restaurants or
at home.
Some time ago I went on a one-day course for Environmental Health Officers
and picked up many useful tips about how correctly to prepare and store food
at home. The Central Catering College, Cornwall Road, London SE1 (Tel:
071-928-9686) is now offering similar one-day courses for professional and
amateur cooks. The cost is Pounds 55.

FT  29 FEB 92 / How to Spend It: Lovely big Macs to go - The Macdonalds'
distinctive and lightweight rainwear

<TEXT>
THERE ARE those who will never be persuaded that a gentlemen wears anything
but a Burberry or an Aquascutum when rain is threatening. But there are
others who have learned that raincoats come in many shapes and forms, and
that those made by Cocoon have something special to offer.
The Cocoon range was started by William and Malla Macdonald a few years ago
and its chief claim to fame was the original fabric - made from a mixture of
60 per cent cotton and 40 per cent nylon. It is light, strong and it
breathes. It is almost totally water-repellent, partly because of the
special weave and partly because it is impregnated with a silicone proofing
agent. The fabric has a lovely, slightly crinkly texture and seems to take
colour exceptionally well. And on top of all that it can be washed in a
washing machine.
There is now another Cocoon fabric, this time a mixture of 60 per cent
cotton and 40 per cent Tactel, which is also light but is softer and more
supple. It is coated with a permanent resin finish.
The original fabric seems almost uncrushable, which makes the raincoats
perfect for travelling - you roll them up and pack them in the pouch they
come in and off you go. When it rains the coat emerges looking as good as
ever it did.
The Macdonalds have wisely gone for a particular niche in the market -
neither safely classic nor ultra-trendy, Cocoon products have that air of
always being vaguely fashionable. The range is small - some strong basic
shapes, homing in on roomy styles that shrug over sweaters or jackets. Each
can be ordered with optional detachable hoods and matching large tammies or
sou'westers, lined with Viyella.
All the coats can be ordered with a Viyella lining that is fastened with
snaps. With the lining the coats are warm enough for all except the very
coldest weather.
The colours are lovely - dark chocolate brown, bright red, light and dark
khaki, black, navy blue. All coats are made to order, so they fit properly
and you get exactly the shape you want, in the colour you have chosen, with
the lining you want. Prices are around the Pounds 150 to Pounds 200 mark and
the coats are made for both men and women.
Potential customers can visit the showroom and workshop on the banks of Loch
Lomond at Alexandria, Scotland, or there is a shop at 28 Victoria Street,
Edinburgh and another at 142 Campden Hill Road, Holland Park, London W8 7AS.
If you cannot visit the shops you can order by mail from Cocoon, Macdonald
Originals, Lomond Industrial Estate, Alexandria, Dumbartonshire, Scotland
G83 OTL. Tel: 0389-55511.

REPRODUCTION used to be a dirty word but, these days, needs must. As the
supply of the genuine articles dies out, those who like their furniture old,
tried and trusted have had to turn to those manufacturers who turn out
perfect copies of the pieces they love.
Priors Hall started life selling antiques but gradually found itself
restoring pieces and then making, for example, a chair to complete a set.
Today, it is engaged full-time in producing fine copies of period furniture.
But it is not in the business of merely copying - it actually builds its
pieces entirely by hand, following the line and spirit of the originals and
using the same materials, the same detailing and the same finishes that make
the original so desirable.
As it copies only the finest and the best, the comparisons in price with
genuine antiques are staggering; for instance, Priors Hall can sell you a
fine copy of a Queen Anne Burr walnut kneehole desk for about Pounds 4,000.
If you could find the real thing, you would probably have to pay around
Pounds 38,000. Priors Hall Chippendale dining chairs sell for Pounds 380
while the going rate for an original is 10 times more. The Regency sofa,
photographed here sells for Pounds 1,250 while an original would probably
fetch Pounds 2,500.
Anybody interested can visit the recently-opened shop at 604 Fulham Road,
London SW6 5RP (Tel: 071-384-2223).

FT  29 FEB 92 / Elephants and ivory: the battle that is being won
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLIGHT of the African elephant arouses high passions. Hunted down and
stripped of tusks and hide by poachers, their numbers in Africa slumped from
1.2m to 600,000 in a decade until, in 1989, CITES - the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species - banned the trade in ivory.
On Monday, when the CITES' 12-day triennial conference begins in Kyoto,
Japan, the wound will be re-opened. Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana,
Namibia and Malawi want the buying and selling of ivory and other elephant
products to resume in order to generate funds for protection and
preservation.
They claim that effective management of native elephant herds has meant that
populations are flourishing, and Zimbabwe even says culling may be needed to
reduce numbers. But conservationists fear that ending the ban will mean a
new wave of poaching, which could have drastic effects on nations to the
north. The debate will be stormy.
Here, IAIN DOUGLAS-HAMILTON, who has been battling for 25 years to protect
the world's largest land animal, explains the background to the meeting -
and the problems that continue to make a lasting solution so difficult.
IN SEPTEMBER 1991, two years after the CITES' ivory ban, a multi-national
team in nine light aircraft criss-crossed Kenya's Tsavo national park - a
wilderness of red earth, thorn bush and blue, faraway hills - looking for
elephants. Over five days, scanning every corner of the 43,000 sq km park,
6,800 live animals were spotted - up 9 per cent since the last count. Even
more important was the near-total absence of fresh carcasses.
Tsavo had been ravaged by poachers and ivory traders. But now, morale was
soaring. Corrupt park staff had gone and the new warden was a true
professional with properly-equipped forces which had confronted and defeated
the intruders. There were still plenty of armed men pouring into Kenya as
the civil war in Somalia raged to the north, but the trading ban meant that
ivory was devalued and not worth the risks any more.
It was a far different story only a few years earlier. After a brief golden
age for elephants in the 1950s and '60s, following the post-Second World War
establishment of national parks, a wave of poaching had spread from east
Africa, driven by the high ivory price and the demand for trinkets and name
stamps in far-off Japan, Europe and the United States. The poaching extended
far west through the equatorial forests and south to the Zambezi river.
Flying over Uganda in 1980, after the fall of dictator Idi Amin, we found a
holocaust. Elephants lay littered on the trails like crumpled leaves, the
wounded dragging their legs as they struggled to keep up with the terrified
herds. In the Murchison Falls national park, there were only 2,300 survivors
from 14,000 elephants in the 1960s.
There were gun battles in the parks as the authorities sought to deal with
the aggressive, heavily-armed poachers. Rangers were killed by Sudanese army
poachers in Kidepo until a determined campaign drove them out. Bodies of
dead poachers were left to be eaten by hyenas.
The problems of Uganda were mirrored time and again elsewhere. Collecting
information, with the help of scientific colleagues across Africa, we found
evidence of elephants speared, trapped, poisoned, burned or shot down with
automatic fire. At times, we came close to despair at the failure of one
initiative after another to stop the slaughter.
The only exceptions to the general trend were in southern Africa, south of
the Zambezi. But we feared the poaching inevitably would spread south, given
the high world demand for ivory.
Finally, in 1989, the sheer weight of evidence of abuse convinced African
governments and Western publics to back the ivory trade ban. And, in
general, there has been an improvement.
Contrary to predictions, it has proved policeable. In most countries, the
ivory price has dropped followed by a rapid decrease in poaching. This is
especially true in the parks and reserves of east Africa, once affected most
seriously. But at next week's CITES' conference in Kyoto, five southern
African nations want to re-open trading. It is a move opposed strongly by
most African countries to the north, which believe it would destroy their
elephants.
The traders sitting on stock-piles of ivory poached before the ban would
benefit the most, as any legal trade would send up the price. It would also
be impossible to prevent the mixing of legal and illegal stocks.
A possible compromise would be for the southern African countries to agree
not to trade in ivory and to confine trade to meat and skins; but there are
fears this would not be sufficiently binding. And yet, the southern African
countries, by giving up ivory sales over the past two years, have borne some
of the cost of keeping elephants alive elsewhere in Africa. Their altruistic
action has saved heavier costs in human and elephant lives, and money, that
would have been incurred by nations to the north.
But for northern countries - in particular, Kenya - keeping the ivory ban is
a matter of economic survival. There is no way it could cope with another
surge in poaching.
Despite Kenya and Zimbabwe being at either end of the spectrum, they have
common interests. Both believe the way forward will include an economic
programme to make wildlife self-sustaining.
Zimbabwe, with its 'camp-fire' programme, has pioneered projects to bring
money to local people from tourism, hunting and cropping exercises. Kenya
has made great strides in doubling its wildlife-based tourist revenues,
although this is being damaged at present by bandit attacks on visitors to
game reserves.
At the heart of the problem is a difference in philosophy between the
protectionist and utilisation lobbies. The arguments have been bitter at
times and represent a real clash of ideas.
The tragedy has been that conservationists on either side of the ivory
divide have fought each other rather than the illegal traders who were the
real enemy.
On the other hand, the matter of culling has now clouded the argument.
Although it is a repellent business, no one has yet come up with a solution
for over-population of elephants - something that is becoming an issue as
numbers grow. And whether you like it or not, culling is a sovereign right
of each country with elephants.
But a recent meeting of African elephant range states at the United Nations
Environment Programme revealed a distinctly encouraging mood. There is a
growing sense of collaboration between African states and a growing
willingness on the part of major donors, such as the US, the European
Community and its individual member-states, to fund elephant programmes
within their aid packages.
A united African initiative to resolve the thorny question of the ivory
trade would be better than any Western-led solution, however
well-intentioned. An African compromise which keeps the ivory trade shut
indefinitely would be worth the price of some nations selling skins from
properly-controlled culling operations. Ultimately, the fate of elephants
lies in the hands of the African peoples themselves.
Iain Douglas-Hamilton is adviser to the European Commission on its elephant
survey and conservation programme. He has also worked for the World Wildlife
Fund and for the New York Zoological Society. Together with his wife, Oira,
he has written the book Battle for the Elephants (Doubleday, Pounds 17.99).

FT  29 FEB 92 / As they say in Europe: Republics of gloom and malice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOURNALISM in the former communist countries generally disappoints those who
expected a sudden irruption of fresh, innocent talent. Only the Russians,
whatever side they are on, have a gift for the vivid phrase, the
articulation of deeply-held prejudices, and pure malice. They also have the
ability to impart it in measured terms. Many could easily find jobs on
British tabloids where these gifts are prized.
Last Sunday in Moscow a number of old-time communists and unsavoury
nationalists were badly beaten up by the militia, the OMON. Unreconstructed
elements in the media had a fine time. The army daily, Krasnaya Zvezda,
wrote: 'On February 23 the fatherland traditionally hails the military
achievements of its defenders. The Moscow government marked the day in the
spirit of the new times - with the fists and batons of OMON troops who
cracked down on old warriors, Afghan veterans, servicemen who 'dared' place
wreaths on the tomb of the unknown soldier.'
Sovietskaya Rossiya said political leaders were able to place wreaths on the
tomb but ordinary Muscovites could not. 'Approaching the tomb . . . they
were met with democratic truncheons.' An on-the-spot report continued, 'From
a distance of 200 metres it is hard to hear what people are shouting. A
rubber truncheon goes up - an OMON trooper strikes an elderly invalid who
tries to defend himself with a crutch. The steady hum of the crowd turns
into an uproar. The chains of OMON and police provoke the masses trying to
get to the Lenin Mausoleum and the tomb of the unknown soldier. Blood is
shed and dozens of people hospitalised.'
Nezavismaya Gazeta is the standard bearer of the liberals, the reformers,
the good guys. So what did it make of this act of repression in the name of
democracy? It was relaxed to the point of insouciance: 'The authorities are
probably resorting to truncheons, not because they are afraid, but to
convince society that there is a red-brown (communist-fascist) threat.
Following the disintegration of the Communist party, the post of 'internal
enemy' has become vacant.'
Pravda disagreed. 'What does the use of truncheons and tear gas against
demonstrators on a public holiday mean?' it asked. The answer was that the
government was afraid of the people 'who had actively rejected the reforms.'
The one-time communist party daily sneakily quoted the chairman of the stock
exchange: 'Do not hinder the government,' the President of Russian
Commodities and Raw Materials Exchange, Konstantin Borovoi, was quoted as
saying. 'This is the first government in seven and a half decades which has
the courage to do something. It faces the task of not only destroying the
command economy system but first and foremost creating a new economy, new
relations between people.'
It balanced that by also quoting the socialist Boris Kagarlitsky: 'Stop
before it is too late. We are threatened with a complete destruction of the
country's modern industrial potential, the country becoming a backward and
poor backwater of the western world, and the loss of national independence.'
So there is a cross-section of media, and public, opinion in a country with
no democratic traditions, where the state has disintegrated and where daily
life verges on the catastrophic.
The French press seems to believe its readers are similarly placed but lacks
the clarity and coherence of the Russian. And it is even more biased. Poor
economic figures published last week led the Quotidien de Paris to remark:
'All the policies adopted for 15 years to strengthen the competitiveness of
the French economy have ended in negative growth . . .' That was on the
basis of a bad final quarter of 1991.
It was a relief to read Franz-Olivier Giesbert in Le Figaro: 'Certainly, in
spite of the debt and the deficits, France's economic situation is not the
most desperate, far from it, on the European continent.'
The press gave itself plenty to feed on: from the poor performance of French
skiers at the Winter Olympics to the impending collapse of the Fifth
Republic. In the by-election in Nice last weekend the Socialist party had
already been eliminated and the National Front nearly won against the
orthodox right. France-Soir wrote, 'The Fifth Republic was bi-polar for a
third of a century, now it is no longer. The strategy of government founded
on the clash of bloc against bloc has no sense now that one citizen in two
does not vote and one in three can't see himself in the the parties which
bring together the right and the left.'
It should be possible to explain how in Russia the papers maintain a certain
sang froid in the face of disaster while in boring old France they seem
quite barmy.

lists to help mail order buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MORE than 60 per cent of the UK retail wine trade is said to be in the hands
of grocery and supermarket chains. Although they sell much of their wine for
immediate drinking they are thrusting into the margins of the fine-wine end
of the market. Yet, it is the traditional, stock-holding merchants who still
maintain the high reputation of the British retail wine trade throughout the
growing and exporting world, especially for vintages that require keeping.
Today, with the heavy cost of holding stock and cash-flow demands, this is a
not a role easy to perpetuate.
The trade does it largely through seasonal mailing lists, backed by special
offers. Even specialist London firms such as Bibendum, NW1 (071-722-5577),
Haynes Hanson &amp; Clark, SW6 (071-736-7878) and La Vigneronne, SW7
(071-589-6113) rely on the mail for a good deal of their trade: about 50 per
cent at Bibendum and 30 per cent at La Vigneronne.
Increasingly, some companies encourage personal visits by giving special
tastings, often tutored, when their clients can see the bottles they propose
buying. Customers of Berry Bros &amp; Rudd - who would be shocked to see even a
shelf of bottles in its ancient premises at St James's, London SW1 - are
directed to Berry Bros Wine Shop in Basingstoke, Hampshire (0256-23566). Lay
&amp; Wheeler of Colchester, Essex (0206-764 446), has a laid-out market that
accounts for half its total sales to individual customers. The Wine
Society's comfortable cellar showroom at Stevenage, Hertfordshire
(0438-740-222), attracts an increasing number of its members, although 75
per cent of orders come by post or telephone.
It is not possible for many private merchants to offer such facilities, so
it is worth looking at how some nationally-recognised companies meet
supermarket competition through selling wines by post. The question is what
to buy.
First, the knowledge of even regular drinkers is often limited. Wine is a
socially-sensitive subject; many feel they 'ought to know' about it. It is
impossible to know everything, particularly as more wines from Europe and
the New World become available. Yet look at the long, unannotated lists of
clarets and burgundies found on wine lists. These may be sufficient for
'insiders'; but for the uninitiated, the only criterion is likely to be
price.
Compiling a price list is expensive and time-consuming. It involves
photographs taken on buying trips, commissioned illustrations and
decorations. Lay &amp; Wheeler spends Pounds 27,000 a year, the Wine Society
Pounds 40,000, on the design and production of their lists. Significantly,
both annotate every wine.
Thomas Peatling of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk (0284-755 948), a subsidiary of
brewer Greene King, provides a note on almost every wine. So does Philip
Eyres of Coleshill, Amersham (0494-433-823). Other companies which go some
way to help their customers in this way are Averys of Bristol
(0272-214-141), Berry Bros &amp; Rudd (071-839-9033), Harveys of Bristol
(0272-26882) and Laytons, London (071-388-5081).
Two firms that take a different line are Adnams of Southwold, Suffolk
(0502-724-222) and Yapp of Mere, Wiltshire (0747-860-423). Simon Loftus of
Adnams writes so compellingly about his favourite growers and their wines
that the long list, although left largely to speak for itself, surely is
just as good; while Robin Yapp displays such an intimate acquaintance with
his suppliers on the Rhone and Loire that his recommendations carry
particular weight.
Some merchants with long lists feel able to provide only brief notes on the
districts and vintages from which wines are on offer. One of these is
Tanners of Shrewsbury (0734-232 400) and another is the House of Townsend,
Hull (0482-26891) with a crowded 58 pages.
Bibendum gives fuller notes, but La Vigneronne concentrates on the vintages
in a typewriter-style catalogue that is not easy to read. Winecellars of
Wandsworth, London SW18 (081-871-3979), an Italian specialist, writes
informatively about the growers and the grape varieties there, but little
about the particular wines.
Then there are the merchants, mostly distinguished, who clearly believe that
their sophisticated customers need little or no guidance except for a
succinct note or details of a particular growth. Such firms include Corney &amp;
Barrow, London EC1 (071-251-4051); Justerini &amp; Brooks, London SW1, a
subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan (071-493-8721); Haynes Hanson &amp; Clark; and
OW Loeb, London SE1 (071-928-7750). A most uninformative list is that of
Valvona and Crolla of Edinburgh (031-556-6066), an Italian wine expert,
although an occasional comment slips through.
Most merchants of any size produce two lists a year: one after the Budget,
which might alter duties, and in the autumn. The Wine Society now issues a
third immediately after Christmas, because it expects cash with orders, and
the autumn list might be depleted by the New Year.
Adnams, Averys, La Vigneronne and Yapp are among those which publish only
post-Budget lists. This surely discourages ordering by the autumn and
especially for Christmas presents; before then, the chosen wines may have
sold out.
Many lists are produced in the large A4 size, which offers greater
opportunities for decoration and illustration: Adnams, Lay &amp; Wheeler and
Winecellars are good examples. But for those who enjoy the sybaritic
pleasure of browsing through lists in bed, the more compact A5 catalogues of
Justerini &amp; Brooks, Tanners and the Wine Society have handling advantages
shared by the even more discreetly-sized handbooks of Berry Bros, and of
Corney &amp; Barrow.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Food: Financial discipline comes first on the menu - The
basic rights and wrongs of restaurant trade costings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   THE RESTAURANT trade has its own sources of inside information
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
less concerned with Budget secrets, perhaps, but invaluable for the latest
culinary fashion and the preoccupations of restaurateurs and chefs.
This year, the talk is about bills and how to keep them small. On the menu,
cod has replaced sea-bass, oxtail is the rage and lentils are here to stay.
But what do chefs know about setting reasonable prices and, more
importantly, keeping them reasonable? It was time to consult Mr J.
During the 1980s Mr J played financial counsellor to more than 10 London
restaurants, carving his own special niche in the market. His duties ranged
from recording takings to credit control; making out the monthly cheques and
wages; petty cash analysis; producing weekly food costs; fortnightly
beverage stock-takes, and producing monthly management accounts.
He was absolutely scrupulous; his only weaknesses were indecipherable
handwriting and a hatred for computers. In a profession where there is
little time for discussion, he produced reliable figures no-one could argue
with - not even the chef. Mr J began our last meeting in his own restaurant
where, finally, he has been able to practice what he has long preached. Any
successful restaurant needs three ingredients: a talented chef, a welcoming
front-of-house and an attentive bookkeeper. With two of the three you might
just survive, but not with fewer, and Mr J. cited two examples. First, a
partnership of two talented chefs who failed to understand either their
customers or their books, and the restaurant went into receivership. Second,
a busy London restaurant with a weekly turnover of Pounds 15,000. It had not
achieved its correct food margin in three years, in spite of excellent
reviews, and had fired its executive chef.
Then to specifics. Of a restaurant's total income, food and beverage costs
should be no more than 40 per cent. This leaves a 60 per cent gross margin
of which 25 per cent of the total income should be the budget for wages, a
further 25 per cent for all other expenses, allowing a gross profit margin
of 10 per cent.
As VAT and Inland Revenue inspectors have clamped down on casual labour, and
rising rent and rates have pushed up overheads, obtaining the right food
cost has become crucial.
Yet Mr J finds this is the discipline which chefs most lack. Their answer,
when food margins are not achieved, is to raise menu prices.
Restaurant-lovers know this is self-defeating: we go less often. The
solution is more fundamental.
Any menu, Mr J argues, must begin with a breakdown of all its ingredients
and a costing of each dish. If a 40 per cent food cost is the goal, then a
dish that will appear on the menu at Pounds 10 must cost no more than Pounds
3 to take account of VAT. Electronic cash tills and computers have made the
arithmetic easier.
But what does Mr J advise for any chef keen to keep his prices low and his
customers happy? He has installed a weekly regime throughout London. He
begins by calculating the food takings separately from the beverage income
and then adding up the cost of all the food delivered, making sure that the
chef does not try to hide even the smallest invoice. This gives an accurate
indication of how the restaurant is faring within 24 hours of the end of a
week's trading.
When the figures are not what they should be the chef will always have an
excuse and Mr J believes he has heard them all. A consignment of expensive
fish had just arrived; a parcel of 'cheap' truffles that were just too good
to miss; or a quiet Saturday night because of the Cup Final. Mr J dismisses
them all. He has other explanations.
First, that the menu costings are incorrect. They must be investigated not
with the intention of raising the prices but by working back from acceptable
menu prices - what the customer will pay - to sustainable costs. There is
also the possibility of loss or theft - a fillet of beef going astray,
deliveries which fall constantly short but which the kitchen does not bother
to re-weigh, or a chef in cahoots with an unscrupulous supplier.
Most often, the answer lies under the chef's very eyes. What is being left
on the customer's plate or going straight into the pig bin? Minimising
wastage has always been an essential quality in a talented chef, but today
nobody congratulates a chef for a meal we can only half-eat. We prefer half
a bill instead.
In the 1970s chefs learnt nouvelle cuisine; in the 1980s how to write
cookbooks and appear on TV; in the 1990s, according to Mr J, they must learn
how to cost and price menus sensibly.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Motor Racing: A two-horse roundabout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW at the newly-rebuilt circuit of Kyalami, South Africa, the lights
will flash from red to green and the Formula One motor-racing roundabout
will twirl into life once more.
The eyes of the 100m-plus global TV audience claimed by the Formula One
Constructors Association will be focused on Ayrton Senna and the burlier
(though much slimmed down) figure of Nigel Mansell.
With Ferrari struggling to retrieve its pride and competitiveness from the
managerial and mechanical shambles which have marked the past two years, few
believe that this year will see much more than a two-horse race.
Senna, still only 31, is coolly committed to securing his fourth world
championship in his Marlboro McLaren Honda. He has a fair chance of
eclipsing the five championships of the legendary Juan Manuel Fangio.
For Mansell, time is running out. At 38, the Englishman knows that this
could be his final stab at the title which has taunted him and his blue and
yellow Canon Williams-Renault.
The doggedness, raw courage and driving skills he displayed last year to
become Senna's runner-up are unlikely to survive another season, should
there be a repeat of last year's early mechanical unreliability which
effectively robbed him of the title.
Yet for a time last season it was the famously well-oiled Marlboro
McLaren-Honda organisation which was to be seen clinging on with one hand,
while scrabbling for the spanners with the other. This is something that Ron
Dennis, the team's boss, is adamant will not be repeated this year.
After Senna won the opening rounds of the season with ease, Dennis concluded
that the McLaren-Honda's superiority was such that the championship was in
the bag and the team could concentrate on developing its 1992 car.
That was a mistake.
By mid-season the Williams-Renault's semi-automatic gearbox had stopped
confusing itself; Renault had found more power, and even the other-wordly
skills of Senna were unable to hold Mansell at bay.
For once, the facade cracked and both partners in McLaren-Honda looked
vulnerable: the Honda engine outclassed on power; McLaren's engineers
fruitlessly seeking ad hoc chassis 'fixes' like any merely mortal grand prix
team.
It was, says Dennis, a case of 'a long-term strategy which was inappropriate
once it became clear that we had a short-term problem. The most difficult
thing to do is bring a grand prix team back to competitiveness in the middle
of a season.'
All the more impressive, then, that thanks to a blitzkrieg effort both by
McLaren and Honda's 7,000-strong research and development engineering
establishment in Japan, the team fought back.
And last week prime minister John Major, with Senna's victorious MP4/6B
racer parked in front of No 10 Downing Street, handed Dennis the 1991 World
Constructors' Championship trophy. On his rise from school-leaver mechanic
in the Woking, Surrey, area which is still his base, to chief executive of
an organisation which employs over 300, Dennis has consciously cultivated a
coldly clinical public persona in which the conduct of the business is
strongly reflected.
In reality, Dennis is a cool but essentially courteous and likeable figure,
by no means lacking in humour. Indeed, there lingers about him an impression
that he still cannot quite believe his success, and that at midnight,
somehow, his technological masterpieces might just turn into pumpkins.
This side of Dennis was reflected in the wide-grinned pleasure so evident at
Downing Street last week. It will be hidden once more when he and his
perfectionist squad of red and white clad technicians (new kit obligatory
for every grand prix) watch the lights change tomorrow.
To the satisfaction of the world's media and to the delight of sponsors such
as Philip Morris, whose Marlboro brand colours are synonymous with McLaren,
the characters climbing on to the carousel are as colourful as ever.
So are the scripts and sub-plots of this high-speed global soap.
Alain Prost, the former world champion and ex-partner (usually sparring) of
Senna at McLaren, who was sacked from Ferrari last year after daring to
criticise the team, is without a drive at Kyalami, having failed to sew up a
deal to drive for Ligier, and perhaps revive the French team's battered
reputation now that it is to share the powerful Renault F1 engine with
Williams.
Jean Alesi, in the aerodynamically revolutionary new Ferrari F92A, and new
team-mate Ivan Capelli, had their hopes of improving the fortunes of Ferrari
lifted in Thursday's unofficial practice, testing fifth and sixth behind the
Williams and McLarens.
Camel Benetton Ford, colourful but anything but united last year as its
management shifted and sport boss Tom Walkinshaw took over, could upset the
applecart if the young German Michael Schumacher can concentrate on his
speed instead of contract disputes.
And this year, to the further delight of the media, there is a female
interest, in the form of Giovanna Amati, the first woman driver to make the
F1 grade since Lella Lombardi in the mid-1970s. Already proven in the
'junior' formula to grand prix F3000, la Amati is driving for Brabham.
Brabham, however, is one of several teams which are but a shadow of their
former selves, ownership and control having long since passed from their
world champion and founder, Sir Jack.
As ever, money shortages lie at the root of the pressures on smaller GP
teams as recession starts to bite even at such normally well-cosseted heels.
It could get worse.
A well-known Formula One constructor once confided to me that, in comparison
with the largesse to be found in grand prix racing, obtaining a licence to
print money seemed like a lot of effort for little reward. That was in the
early 1980s, since when the sums involved in sponsoring GP teams have
accelerated almost as quickly as the cars.
The stakes have risen so fast largely because the tobacco industry has had
its other promotional avenues closed off.
Yet early in February, the European Parliament voted to ban all tobacco
advertising. The vote remains a long way from legislation but showed
strongly which way the anti-tobacco smoke is blowing. Last season the
Marlboro, Gitanes and Camel brands between them supported a total of 18
grand prix teams, providing cash and resources totalling Dollars 100m
(Pounds 57m).

<TEXT>
FIRST, THE facts. An Aston Martin Virage is hand-made. It seats two people
in luxury and two more if they are prepared to suffer acute discomfort.
It is the size of a Ford Scorpio and weighs nearly two tons. A 5.3-litre,
330-horsepower V8 engine propels it from 0-60 mph (0-96 kmh) in a
tyre-smoking 6.5 seconds, and on to a maximum of 155 mph (250 kmh). To own
one, you must be able to write a cheque for Pounds 132,000.
In a world where - German autobahns excepted - using that performance puts
licence, and even liberty, at risk, is there any point in making such cars?
Commonsense says not but Aston Martin thinks otherwise. As though an
off-the-peg Virage was not potent enough, it has produced an even faster
version.
The engine, enlarged to 6.3 litres, develops 465 horsepower (a 40 per cent
increase), cutting the 0-60 mph time to under 5.5 seconds and raising the
maximum speed to 174 mph (280 kmh).
New brakes are the largest ever fitted to a production car and, for the
first time on an Aston Martin, they have an anti-lock system.
The suspension is modified; the wheels and tyres are new; and the price goes
up by Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 182,000, which makes a Pounds 111,364 Bentley
Turbo R seem positively cheap.
What role is the converted Virage supposed to play? Is it the equivalent of
a pit bull terrier for the moneyed motoring classes? A case of piling
superfluity upon excess? Or a classic example of ingenuity misapplied?
Not according to Walter Hayes, Aston Martin's chairman. Hayes, former
vice-president of the Ford Motor Company, told me without a flicker of a
smile that a standard Virage was potent enough for most customers. But some
 -the sort who would have chosen the V8 Vantage a few years back - felt the
need for more performance. Hence the go-even-faster Virage.
What is it like to drive? I doubt that I shall ever find out.
But service division director Kingsley Riding-Felce says reassuringly - and
apparently seriously - that the standard Virage's 'flexibility and
practicality' have not been lost. As he put it: 'We did not wish to end up
with a massively powerful and unsocial car . . . unsuitable for anything but
motorways. With the 6.3, we have . . . a high-performance, yet still
classic, sports car which is eminently suitable for everyday use and a great
pleasure to drive.'
I must live on a different planet from people who build, buy or even dream
about owning Pounds 182,000 Aston Martins, or who think seriously that a
465-horsepower, 2+2-seat car is suitable for everyday use.
Aston Martin is owned by Ford, which bought it for an undisclosed sum in
October 1987. More than the purchase price has been spent on product and
factory improvements.
About 2,300 very high-performance supercars are bought world-wide each year.
Ferrari (owned by Fiat) dominates the market; Aston Martin and Lamborghini
fight over most of what is left.
Aston Martin clearly has done well from the Ford connection. What Ford has
got out of it is less obvious, although Hayes sees Aston Martins being used
as test beds for high-tech (and high-cost) components that might one day
filter down to humbler products.
To ensure their life span will stretch far into the 21st century, Aston
Martin has just announced a 'car for life' scheme. This guarantees the
possibility of as-new restoration for all post-1950 models. Their
performance can be improved by using technology not available when they were
built.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Cricket: The instant game loses its thrill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARE WE witnessing the beginning of the end of the one-day cricket
phenomenon?
That might seem an odd question in the middle of the hype that surrounds the
World Cup, currently taking place in Australia and New Zealand. But there
are indications that the frenetic excitement which has been the hallmark of
the instant game may be disappearing as the format matures.
There has been plenty of drama. Australia's defeats by New Zealand and South
Africa, and England's win over the West Indies, must have stirred the hearts
of cricket fans everywhere. But the excitement has been in the results, not
on the field.
South Africa's victory over Australia in Sydney marked a triumphant return
after two decades in the wilderness. England's crushing victory in Melbourne
confirmed the decline of the West Indies and the re-emergence of Graham
Gooch's side as a cricketing force.
But both games were rather boring to watch. There are several reasons for
this, the most important of which is a weakness in the structure of the
one-day game which has only recently become apparent.
Back in the early 1970s, when instant cricket was becoming established in
England, most games followed a predictable pattern. Both sides would start
slowly, and then build to a crescendo in the final few overs as batsmen
threw the bat in an effort to maximise the score. The format guaranteed
plenty of big hitting in the first innings, probably followed by tumbling
wickets and a run chase in the last hour as the side batting second began to
run out of overs.
However, as the diet of one-day matches has increased, the players have
learnt to pace themselves, so that the second innings run chase is becoming
the exception rather than the rule. This is particularly true of games where
the side batting first makes a low total, as Australia did against South
Africa and the West Indies did against England. All that is then necessary
is for the top-order batsmen of the side batting second to keep their heads.
If they can do that, the advantage of knowing the required run rate will get
them home, as Kepler Wessels and Gooch showed for the Springboks and England
respectively.
There are other pointers to the changing nature of the game. For example,
quick bowling is disappearing as the smartest captains realise how expensive
the fast men can be with artificial one-day field settings.
New Zealand excluded Danny Morrison, their fastest bowler, from their
triumphant side in Auckland, and opened instead with medium pace from Chris
Cairns and off-spin from Dipak Patel. England have prospered with a bowling
line-up of four medium pacers, including the portly Ian Botham, still
swinging the ball viciously on occasions, but several yards slower than in
his salad days. Pakistan took the strategy to extremes against Zimbabwe in
Hobart on Thursday by using three spinners and a slow seamer for most of
their 50 overs. Imran Khan would have bowled had he been fit, but even he
relies more on guile than pace these days.
By contrast, Australia went into both their unsuccessful matches with
McDermott and Reid, their two fastest bowlers, and the West Indies relied
heavily on Curtly Ambrose and Malcolm Marshall against England and in their
earlier win against Pakistan. The Australian pair had aggregate figures of 3
for 146 for the two games, the West Indians 0 for 156.
The exception has been South Africa's Allan Donald, inevitably dubbed 'White
Lightning', who grabbed three Australian wickets for 34 runs off 10 overs.
But while Donald got the wickets, it was Richard Snell, another change
bowler, who strangled the Australian run rate with 0 for 15 in 9 overs.
Bobby Simpson, the Australian coach, put his finger on another development
when he pointed out that Australia had been beaten twice because its tactics
had been successfully copied by the opposing sides. He was right.
Australia's dominance of the one-day game over the past four years has been
built on percentage batting rather than big hitting, backed by shrewd field
placings to restrict the opposition score. That is the formula which has
been exploited by England, New Zealand and South Africa, three sides which
look likely to reach the semi-finals.
There are still plenty of big hitters in the game, and matches can still be
turned round in a few overs by batsmen like Botham, Wessels and Australia's
David Boon. But as the tactical development of the game continues, there may
be less of the spectacular batting which one-day cricket has delivered so
often in the past. While that might please the purists, it would not be
greeted with much enthusiasm among the paying customers, who have become
used, for example, to seeing the square cut played from outside leg stump.
Ominously, there were a few chants of 'boring' even at the Australia-South
Africa and England-West Indies games, where the crowd was largely made up of
committed supporters.
There are 30 matches left in the World Cup, including today's crucial clash
between New Zealand and South Africa in Auckland, for the players to show
that maturity has not robbed the one-day game of its magic.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The big guns aim down market -
Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOFTWARE companies have become busy in the last six months releasing cheap
versions of well known packages. This change was prompted by the arrival of
the Windows 3 operating system.
Windows is (we are told) being adopted extensively by big corporate users.
The software package market is therefore starting to split into two - the
corporate sector based on Windows and the mass market based on traditional
DOS.
As DOS becomes severed from the corporate market, DOS package prices are
starting to fall. The result is eminently satisfactory - for the corporate
user big, slow and expensive packages running under Windows, for the rest of
us simple, fast and now cheap packages running under DOS.
As part of their approach to the mass market, leading software suppliers
such as Borland and Lotus are experimenting with sales through the 'retail
channel'.
You will not find Quattro Pro SE or Lotus Executive (see below) in PC
magazines or dealers: they are only available through high street shops such
as Dixons, Wildings, Rymans.
A word here - in order to justify the low price, cheap packages are often
promoted as 'cut-down' versions of the premium product. However, it is
easier for the software companies to take a proven, product rather than
produce a special cut down version which then has to be tested in the field
and requires specialist support.
As we saw recently with Quattro Pro SE, they are equally likely to dust down
and repackage the previous full-price version of the software. It is easy to
support because there are still thousands of people out in the field using
this old version. So in many cases you are getting the full-price version
minus the latest bells and whistles. Or look at it another way: instead of
buying a package which gives you five times as many functions as you need,
you are only buying one with three times as much.
Much of the pace in the mass market is being made by Borland. Apart from the
spreadsheet Quattro Pro SE (Pounds 49.95) which is a bargain of bargains,
they have also bought out the database Paradox SE (Pounds 79.95), equivalent
to the premium product Paradox 3.5 (Pounds 595) except that it lacks one or
two advanced functions for power users such as SQL linking and Personal
Programmer. With a helpful Sybex self-teach guide as documentation, Paradox
SE can be recommended to non-programmers who wants to try writing their own
applications.
Lotus Corporation has recently set up a small business unit and late last
year dipped its toe in the water with its first offering, a slightly
convoluted affair called Lotus Executive with Filofax at Pounds 149.99.
Lotus Executive is basically Lotus 1-2-3 release 2.3 (the standard version
of 1-2-3, RRP Pounds 299) minus one or two esoteric features such as the
Macro Manager. The documentation is brief but excellent, being a re-badged
self-teach book called 'The 10-minute Guide to Lotus 1-2-3'. Lotus Executive
with Filofax comes with an attractive leather binder, a set of Filofax pages
for 1992, and some Filofax 'templates' written under 1-2-3. An obvious must
for any Filofax user; anyone else can buy it in order to get a half-price
version of Lotus 1-2-3 and then give away the Filofax to an unsuspecting
friend as a present. This product is only available at a few city centre
branches of Rymans and 16 branches of Dixons. However, your local branch of
Dixons will order a copy for you if you ask them.
Lotus is getting its act together in the small business market and we shall
see more of Lotus Executive. Next week it will release Lotus Write, again at
Pounds 149, a Windows-based word processor based on its top of the range Ami
Professional 2 (RRP Pounds 499). Lotus has also announced that it is working
on a new version of its entry-level integrated package Lotus Works (combined
spreadsheet, word processor and simple database).
When it comes to DOS-based word processing packages, the world's top selling
package by a wide margin is WordPerfect 5.1 (RRP Pounds 399), made by the
company of the same name. Early last year it brought out LetterPerfect
(Pounds 169), available through dealers, not the high street.
A subsequent survey of budget packages in a PC magazine found that if you
are using LetterPerfect and 'need to upgrade to 5.1, you will find you know
it already.' Run side by side the two programs looked virtually identical.
'The fact is that LetterPerfect beats many 'full-featured' programs, and
nothing else in the market comes close to it'.
LetterPerfect is completely compatible with WordPerfect, allowing you to
transfer documents between both programs. The only difference of major
importance seems to be that you cannot print in columns. WordPerfect claim
that LetterPerfect is aimed at users of portable computers. A jolly good
effort by the marketing department, but really this is pure baloney. Unless
you have to produce newsletters with columns, buy LetterPerfect every time.

No, because (a) there is no prospective CGT -bill and (b) the fact that

deductible. If it is to your advantage, it may be possible for you to claim
relief under section 534 (or possibly 535) of the Income and Corporation
Taxes Act 1988. This depends upon more facts, figures and dates than you

FT  29 FEB 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Calculating base value for shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE has shares acquired in two main blocks. Her parents gave her some as
part of a settlement on in March 1976. She inherited some more shares when
her mother died in February 1988. (The shares were actually received several
months later when probate was granted.)
Is it correct to assume for Capital Gains Tax purposes, that both sets of
shares have a base value which is their value on 31/3/82? (My wife made an
election under 596(5) of the Finance Act 1988 on 24/2/91)
Where can I find the values at 31/3/82 of the shares? (or the values at
other relevant dates?)
Your wife's original shareholding is indeed deemed to have been acquired on
March 31, 1982 at its market value on that day (on the quarter-up basis). On
the other hand, the shares which she inherited are deemed to have been
acquired on the day of her mother's death at their probate value (on the
quarter-up basis). Any sale will be deemed to come primarily out of the
later holding (which will be pooled with any further purchases etc.)
If her mother's shares were valued for inheritance tax purposes, then that
value should appear in the statements sent to her by the solicitors at the
time when the residue of the estate was distributed. In a local reference
library, you may find the books of adjusted March 31 1982 prices published
by Extel Financial or Stubbs (Dun &amp; Bradstreet), or the Stock Exchange Daily
Official List.
Alternatively you can ask your tax office, although they may take a long
time to supply the figures. In any case, you should ask the tax office for
some or all of the following free pamphlets:
CGT13 - The indexation allowance for quoted shares; CGT14 - Capital gains
tax: an introduction; CGT15 - Capital gains tax: a guide for married
couples; CGT16 - Indexation allowance: disposals after 5 April 1988.

CHARLES Miller owns up to one or two weaknesses in the company he runs.
Indeed, he concedes: 'We couldn't sell our way out of a paper bag.' But
then, the Public Policy Unit's marketing requirements are limited. It exists
to help companies and organisations find their way around the murky and
misshapen corridors of Whitehall as they seek to influence government
thinking and legislation. Do civil servants possess the gumption to make a
working life for themselves once they depart the cushioned torpor of
Westminster? The success of the PPU shows some do. But its staff are a
rather select collection who work full time or on contract for the political
and regulatory advice agency since it was set up in 1985.
The 22 'members' of the company include political lobbyists, a journalist
and prospective parliamentary candidates as well as former fast-track civil
servants, most of whom worked in the private sector before coming to the
PPU. Miller, the chief executive, worked with Lloyd's of London and as a
political adviser for Tate &amp; Lyle as well as being a researcher in the House
of Commons.
The PPU unearths information about what the government is doing, and helps
companies prepare and present cases - whether for a brewer, a drugs company
worried about new laws, or an airline seeking a change in UK airport policy.
Business has been lucrative. Turnover for its second full year was Pounds
200,000. Last year it was Pounds 770,000, yielding a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 115,000. Miller says profits this year will leap to about Pounds
280,000, partly because of its merger in the next few weeks with another
company with a similar turnover. The PPU, which has just seven full-time
staff, is quite separate from the left and right wing think-tanks with
rather similar names - the Institute for Public Policy Research and the
Centre for Policy Studies (although the latter happens to be in the office
next door). It started when eight people with connections in Whitehall
decided to set up a company that would explain to corporate clients the
workings of Whitehall and Westminster and the routes through which to
influence decision-makers.
'If you knock on the door and say the secret code word, they will let you
in,' Miller says.
He used Pounds 7,000 of his own money to start the business while a
now-defunct merchant bank took a shareholding and provided office space in
the City.
'You don't need much money or equipment to start,' says Miller.
The PPU has now moved to Victoria, close to its target area. 'Much of our
work could be done from John O'Groats but clients think it's necessary to be
near Westminster.'
What is the biggest misconception companies have about Whitehall?
'They do not realise how low down decisions are made,' says David Lidington,
a PPU member, former ministerial adviser and prospective parliamentary
candidate. 'Most of the key decisions which affect businesses are taken at
assistant secretary or principal level, not by permanent secretaries. Those
lower levels are the engine room of Whitehall.'
Apart from lobbying, case-building and presentation, the PPU runs training
programmes to help executives understand government. It publishes a range of
documents on such subjects as 'The background of MPs' and 'Lobbying -
understanding and influencing the corridors of power.'
The company has 32 clients including Procter &amp; Gamble, Salomon Brothers and
British Airways. Retainers - which range between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds
15,000 a month - account for 65 per cent of its fees. Annual earnings of
members range from Pounds 5,000 to about Pounds 50,000, depending on the
fees they attract. Miller, who takes a salary of Pounds 38,000, is often
caustic about Whitehall. 'You are working in this enormous structure where
you might not know what's going on four doors down the corridor, where the
switchboard does not always work properly, and where most of the staff are
totally unmotivated.' He compares this with a small business. 'Suddenly, you
are in a small firm where you really count. You've got real responsibility -
if you don't do it, nobody will; and if you don't sell, you don't eat.'
But he misses Whitehall, too. 'We are insiders who are now outsiders. I
think we all miss being at the centre of things, being where the buzz is.'

FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Beware the direct approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NATIONAL television campaign is under way to persuade more people to use
direct debit as a means of settling bills.
The use of direct debiting as a form of payment has risen fivefold over the
past 10 years with over 900m direct debits processed last year. They are now
more popular than standing orders, which were used to pay 230m bills last
year.
A direct debit is an instruction to an 'originator' - a utility, insurance
company and the like - or the customer's bank or building society to collect
money automatically from their account. The system is handled electronically
through BACS Limited, which is running the advertising campaign.
Reduced administrative costs for banks, building societies and companies are
behind the drive to get consumers to switch to direct debit. A standing
order involves paperwork since the customer has to give an order to their
account holder every time the amount paid changes. 'It is more economical to
process a direct debit than to handle a cheque,' said Caryl Skelton of BACS.
'That takes administration, people and handling time. Using direct debit is
much more cost effective.'
Institutions are keen to win over the public by arguing that reduced costs
are passed on. Norwich Union tried to wean its 600 or so policyholders who
have standing orders to switch to direct debit, even offering a Pounds 50
bonus as an incentive. 'By doing this we will reduce our costs (which will
directly benefit you); be able to allocate your contributions to your
pension quickly and improve our overall administration service to you,' it
said in its letter to policyholders in December.
Consumers would do well to ask whether they benefit as much from direct
debits as the institutions evidently do although they can be a useful and
easy form of payment. The present campaign encourages the consumer to make
'bills easier to swallow' by spreading them over the year.
This involves the utilities estimating what you are likely to use during the
year and debiting the amount from your account in monthly instalments. In
other words, you will be paying in advance for something you would normally
settle after receiving it.
For some people, usually those who dislike thinking about their finances or
are disorganised, spreading payments in this way means that they will not
get hit with large bills. They also do not have to keep remembering to renew
a union subscription or pay regular bills such as the poll tax.
However, direct debit does allow access to your account by others and it is
as well to be aware of this. You are well protected in the case of a mistake
since your bank or building society is responsible for making good the error
(unfortunately, a lot of bank tellers still do not know this). If the
monthly outgoing is variable, such as a mortgage, the originator has to
inform you in writing two weeks in advance and if it does not and money is
debited, the bank would have to reimburse you should a disagreement occur
over the amount.
But what of the case of a reader who suddenly found over Pounds 1,200
debited from his account when an insurance company decided (erroneously, in
the event) that one year's premiums had not been collected? And you are
forever in the position of reacting if mistakes are made rather than knowing
they cannot happen.
Most hiccoughs with the system occur when it comes to cancelling or altering
your direct debit. If you change to or from a direct debit, you must
remember to tell your bank. One reader found two payments of their mortgage
had gone out of their account as a result of a changeover.
While direct debits may seem a simpler more convenient form of payment, the
onus is on you to check your statement to ensure mistakes have not been
made. Those who fill in the direct debit form and forget, may be living in
blissful ignorance of what is going on in their account.

PROFIT-TAKING at Titon follows a period of sharp outperformance in which the
shares have all but trebled in value over the last 12 months to around 65p.
Since then, the company has announced final results which revealed an
impressively resilient performance - profits up 64 per cent and earnings up
72 per cent.
An increase in the number of directors selling and exercising options may
indicate that directors are uneasy about the outcome of the UK election.
Almost exactly one year ago, Peter Nicholson, a director of the
housebuilding group Crest Nicholson, sold 250,000 shares at 92p. This week,
he appears in our column having bought back 100,000 shares at just 30p. The
company recently reported record losses of almost Pounds 6m.
It is not often you see the chairman of a large company such as BP buying
his own stock. Bob Horton paid 263p per share for 20,000 shares after he
reported 'extremely disappointing results'.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bad buys in the transfer market -
Think hard before opting out of occupational pension schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS growing concern about employees who are persuaded to transfer
valuable pension rights from good occupational schemes into personal
pensions. The Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro)
reports an increasing number of cases in which inexperienced or unscrupulous
insurance salesmen are arranging transfers that are detrimental to the
client's interests and serve only to line the salesmen's pockets.
Such transfers are complex transactions and require professional assistance.
Lautro lays down strict guidelines on what personal information must be
included in a salesman's 'fact-find' about the prospective client. These
guidelines have not always been followed, Lautro says.
It adds: 'Sometimes, it is because the representatives have not been trained
regarding how and why they should undertake such an analysis. Sometimes,
they have been adequately trained but nonetheless chose to ignore the
requirement.'
This problem is compounded by the failure of insurance companies adequately
to monitor the fact-finds which are submitted by salesmen before the sale is
completed. Lautro says companies should identify and intercept inadequate
fact-finds but, in some cases, are not doing this.
These cases represent the tip of the iceberg, Lautro says, because most
individuals do not understand the implications of transferring out of
occupational schemes into personal pensions and do not report the problem.
'Cases of this type inevitably cause the complainants considerable anxiety,
together with anger that someone should appear to gamble with one of the
most important areas of their financial arrangements.
'Even so, in view of the limited understanding of the complex subject of
pensions among members of the public, the level of complaints received on
this score may well understate the scale of the potential problem,' Lautro
says.
Personal pensions, introduced in July 1988, were never intended to be used
as an alternative to good occupational schemes. Rather, they were designed
to give a greater choice to individuals whose employer does not run a group
scheme and who had to belong automatically to the state earnings-related
pension scheme (Serps).
Even in these limited instances, there is evidence of mis-selling on a vast
scale. A recent report from the Equal Opportunities Commission identified
250,000 women who were sold personal pensions when they would have been
better off in Serps. In the 1988-89 tax year, the Department of Social
Security said 63,000 women who were sold personal pensions had no earnings
during this period and, therefore, did not qualify for any pension at all.
Transfers from occupational schemes to personal pensions is the
fastest-growing market for many insurance companies. The Association of
British Insurers (ABI) reported a 35 per cent increase in single premium
business for 1991. A large proportion of this business, which was worth
almost Pounds 4.2bn, will have come from transfers, with most cases running
into tens of thousands of pounds.
Salesmen receive at least 4 per cent commission on these transactions -
often more - while the insurance company itself will deduct charges for
administration and insurance management.
In most cases, transfers take place after a change of job. Employees who
were members of the former employer's scheme for more than two years cannot
take a cash refund on contributions. Instead, they can leave the benefits
with the former scheme and draw a pension on retirement. This is known as a
'preserved' or 'deferred' pension.
Employees have two other options. The first is for the benefits to be
transferred to the new employer's scheme. The second is for the preserved
pension to be converted into a 'transfer value,' which can then be invested
in a personal pension or in a similar insurance product known as a buy-out
bond.
Employees in the public sector get the best deal on transfers because all
pension benefits are index-linked, even on preservation. The public sector
also operates the 'transfer club,' which allows employees to change jobs
within the system and receive like-for-like benefits in the new scheme.
Outside the public sector, preserved pensions and pension transfers may be
more a question of damage limitation than real improvement. Most people lose
out simply because, once an employee leaves a scheme, the value of the
pension is no longer linked to real earnings' growth; instead, annual
increases are capped at 5 per cent. This is known as limited price
indexation (LPI).
If a previous employer provides increases in excess of this, as well as good
dependants' benefits for spouses and children, the preserved pension is
likely to be the employee's best option. In other cases, a transfer to the
new employer's scheme could be the right choice if more generous benefits
are offered. Normally, one of these two options is likely to offer a safer
alternative than a move to a personal pension.
The problem with transferring to a personal pension is that it is difficult
to compare like with like. Most good occupational schemes in the UK operate
on a final-salary basis, so that each year of service builds up to provide a
maximum pension at retirement of two-thirds of final salary (subject to
certain limits for high earners). Personal pensions are money purchase
plans, which means that the value of the pension at retirement will depend
on the investment returns of the chosen fund. There are no guarantees.
Martin Slack, a partner with actuaries Lane Clark &amp; Peacock, says: 'There
are two stages in any transfer question. First, it is important to assess
whether it is worth moving the preserved pension. If so, it is vital to get
professional advice to get a meaningful comparison between the options.
'Many advisers and salesmen simply don't bother to ask the first question at
all. Nor do they fully understand the nature of the preserved benefits that
are being given up when the transfer is taken.'
It is not just job-changers who are being persuaded to put occupational
pension benefits into personal pensions, though. Lautro quotes a case where
several salesmen from the same branch of an insurance company transferred a
number of employees systematically out of a particularly attractive group
scheme and into personal pensions.
Unless there is a serious problem with an occupational pension scheme, it is
rarely good practice to transfer to a personal pension. The loss of that
vital link of the pension to final salary is most unlikely to be replaced by
a money purchase plan. Furthermore, most employers do not contribute to
personal pensions if they operate a good group scheme.
Lautro's point about the vulnerability of consumers in relation to sales of
complex pension products is a very real concern, and one which the Financial
Services Act has failed adequately to regulate. Unfortunately, the new
pensions ombudsman, who has statutory power to force miscreants to put right
errors and compensate victims, is barred from investigating unscrupulous
sales of personal pensions.
Instead, this is left to the insurance ombudsman and to Lautro, neither of
which has statutory powers. And there is a limit on the compensation that
can be paid to victims of sales abuses under these complaints schemes.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Losing at cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT PAYS to read the small print in those leaflets which accompany your
monthly credit card statement. Holders of Chase Manhattan's Visa card will
have received a leaflet in the last few weeks informing them that the card,
which is now issued by Girobank, is to be renamed Atlantic, writes David
Barchard.
But study the leaflet which accompanies the letter carefully. Girobank and
Atlantic have introduced charges which could add considerably to the cost of
the account.
Girobank says charging its customers for special services keeps the price of
the card competitive.
If customers fail to make a charge by the due date, there is a Pounds 12
fine. If they exceed their credit limit, there is a Pounds 12 fine. If a
cheque bounces, there is only a charge of Pounds 8 and the Pounds 12
lateness charge is not made: banks are not supposed to make charges on
charges.
Extra copies of sales vouchers and statements are charged at Pounds 5. Most
of the big card issuers, with the exception of Lloyds, have quietly
introduced charges for duplicate vouchers and statements over the last two
years.
A Girobank spokesman says that the charges are in line with those being
introduced by other banks and he does not think it is unreasonable to charge
a customer who misses the due date.
But the customer is already being charged interest for missing the payment
date - and the flat fee may be larger than the amount due.
All credit card operations are currently under pressure. Customers are much
more careful about paying on time and sales volumes have fallen.
The banks have had to find other ways of making card businesses pay.
Some banks - Lloyds is one - say they have no miscellaneous charges, but
Midland says it has been charging its customers for more than a year for
some additional services on their cards, including Pounds 5 for duplicate
statements or a copy of a sales voucher and Pounds 10 for a change of
statement date.
Barclays charges less. Duplicate sales vouchers cost Pounds 3 as do copies
of monthly statements. If an account is seriously 'out of order' a charge of
Pounds 7.50 can be made. NatWest makes similar charges. The market seems to
have accepted them without demur.
Apart from Giro and its Atlantic Visa Card offshoot, no banks yet charge
credit card customers for failing to make a payment by the due date or
exceeding the credit limit.
Girobank says: 'We recognise that there are good reasons for late arrival of
payments and we will not apply the Pounds 12 charge for at least the first
five working days after the due date,' says a spokesman. He adds that the
Atlantic Visa card charges only 23.1 per cent a year interest: the lowest
rate in the credit card market.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Companies face a dividend dilemma -
The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS who rely on share dividends for income will be facing this company
reporting season with trepidation. Many companies are expected to cut
dividends or even omit them altogether.
Since analysts expect corporate earnings to have fallen generally in 1991,
companies will be under pressure to cut dividends. Even so, forecasts are
for a small increase across the market. Broker Barclays de Zoete Wedd
suggests a 4 per cent rise from industrial companies as a whole.
This would, roughly, match the rate of inflation, against which investors
look to rising equity dividends to provide a hedge (although, as the chart
shows, there are periods such as the 1970s when this has not happened).
Many companies must decide if they can afford to maintain a dividend,
despite lower profits, in the hope that the economy and their business will
recover in the near future; or if they should conserve much-needed cash and
reduce the pay-out. If after-tax profits are too little for a dividend, then
companies will have to draw on reserves from previous years.
Brokers say the level of dividend cover - the number of times a dividend
could be paid from available earnings - has fallen to around two. That is
lower than in the depths of the recession early in the 1980s.
Even when the economy begins to bounce back, it could take a long time for
dividend cover to be rebuilt. For it to reach 2.5, BZW estimates that three
years of earnings' growth of 12 per cent annually, with no dividend
increases, would be needed. Investors with long memories will recall that
after ICI, the chemicals group, cut its dividend in 1981, it took eight
years to be restored in real terms.
Already, some leading companies have announced reductions. Lonrho cut its
final dividend from 8p to 5p, and Vickers from 6.2p to 2.3p. And, this week,
Royal Insurance passed its final dividend, which had been 14 3/4 p in 1990.
Meanwhile, other companies have not increased the pay-out as much as hoped.
BP, for instance, did not raise its final dividend at all.
In such cases, there is often a double blow for investors - not only the
reduction in income but also a fall in the value of their shares. Royal's
shares fell from 226p on Thursday morning, before its results were
announced, to 183p by last night.
Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, took a different course, changing
from half-yearly to quarterly dividend payments. Although shareholders will
end up getting the same amount in the end - and, in future, it might even be
more convenient to receive dividends quarterly rather than half-yearly - it
might seem in the short term that they are worse off.
It is not all bad news, however. Holders of Midland Bank shares, who had
braced themselves for no final dividend, were pleasantly surprised on
Thursday when the clearing bank paid 1.7p, the same as for 1990. Midland's
shares rose from 239p on Thursday morning to 267p last night.
Vickers, which reported final results on Monday, pleased the stock market
when it did not cut its final dividend by as much as analysts had expected.
On Thursday, Alfred McAlpine, the construction and house-building group,
decided to maintain its final dividend even though it had to dip into
reserves.
As March stretches ahead, though, many companies are likely to reduce final
dividends. Which ones? A clue can be gleaned from the yield column in the
daily share price tables.
Companies with shares offering high yields on the basis of their payment
last year are probable candidates for a dividend cut, since their share
prices had been pushed down in anticipation. Shares in companies such as
construction group Tarmac, insurance giant Guardian Royal Exchange,
Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the conglomerate, and T&amp;N, the motor components
group, are on historic double-figure yields.
As these names show, the worst of the dividend cuts are likely to be in
sectors hit most by the recession, such as building and engineering and the
financial sector. Elsewhere, in such sectors as health and household, or
among consumer goods groups, there are prospects of dividend increases.
A year ago, some of the big fund managers were urging companies to maintain
dividend payments. Now, though, cuts are almost respectable.
Last autumn, the governor of the Bank of England warned companies of the
dangers of paying dividends they could not afford. Many companies must hope
that, with such authoritative backing, their shareholders may forgive them
for taking a prudent stance.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bureaux de Change face new controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry has announced measures to tighten
controls on Bureaux de Change.
Edward Leigh, consumer affairs minister at the DTI, revealed the new
measures in a written reply to a parliamentary question. They mean that:
Bureaux must give full information on commission rates and any other fees,
and give them the same prominence as the exchange rates themselves.
Advertised exchange rates must give full details on the terms on which
transactions are made - if operators buy and sell currency at different
rates, or offer different rates for travellers' cheques, these must be
shown.
Rates must be visible as customers approach the premises.
Leigh also announced that customers should be given receipts setting out the
details of the transactions, and that companies will be required to give a
clear explanation of the basis on which rates will be determined when
currency is ordered for a later date.
These regulations come into force on May 18 this year. However, bureaux will
be given until May 18 next year to display fees and commissions with the
same prominence as exchange rates.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: NI rebate cut in Serps move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has announced the size of the cut in the rebate in National
Insurance payments it is offering to those who opt out of the state
earnings-related pension scheme (Serps). From April next year, the rebate
will be reduced from the present 5.8 per cent to 4.8 per cent of earnings.
The 2 per cent incentive offered to those opting out for the first time will
be cut to 1 per cent.
Last autumn, the government actuary called for a rebate of 4.68 per cent to
ease the state's burden of pension provision by encouraging employees to
take out a personal plan instead. Employees who are not members of a company
pension scheme enjoy a rebate on National Insurance contributions if they
opt out of Serps. Since 1988, more than 4.6m people have done this and gone
into personal plans.
The rebate is calculated as a percentage of those earnings between the lower
and upper National Insurance contribution levels. For the 1991-92 tax year,
these limits are Pounds 2,700 and Pounds 20,280 per annum. The present
rebate is 8.47 per cent; so if you opt out of Serps for this tax year by
April 5, the Department of Social Security will pay a maximum of Pounds
1,490 into a personal pension of your choice. This includes the 2 per cent
incentive. Tony Newton, the social security minister who made the
announcement on Thursday, said he was considering offering higher rebates to
older people and less generous ones to those in their 20s. He proposed an
additional rebate of 1 per cent payable only to those aged 30 and above on
personal pension plans from April 1993.
Flat-rate rebates favour those in their 20s and 30s since they have longer
to invest them - which should result in a larger pension.
Sun Life, the insurance company, yesterday criticised limiting the 1 per
cent additional rebate solely to personal plans and not to final salary and
occupational money purchase schemes, warning that it would result in bias
against these schemes. It recommended that, in general men, over 47 and
women over 40 should not contract out if they were doing so for the first
time.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Buying other people's life policies -
How to .. invest in a second-hand endowment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU want to invest in an endowment policy, why not buy someone else's?
When buying second-hand endowments, you are unlikely to be sold a 'pup.' And
such policies are offering attractive returns - around 14 per cent before
tax.
It sounds baffling, but the market is surprisingly simple. You buy an
existing endowment for a cash sum and pay the premiums until the contract
matures. Then, you receive the maturity payment.
The market has expanded rapidly in recent years. Policies can be bought in
two ways:
From a market-maker. This is the easier way. Lists issued each month by
market-makers set out the available endowments, which are listed by maturity
date and price. You simply look through the list for a policy with a
suitable maturity date and decide if the price is acceptable.
Monthly lists from Beale Dobie, a leading market-maker, show maturity dates
ranging from a few months to more than 10 years ahead.
Market-makers also give information to help you decide if the price is right
and to judge the merits of the investment. This includes the name of the
life company; the original term; sum assured plus attaching bonuses and
premium; the approximate surrender value; the assumed maturity value on the
life company's present bonus rates; the terminal bonus ratio; and the
internal rate of return (IRR) - the before-tax return which the investor
would get, including future premium payments, if this maturity value is
achieved.
One point needs emphasising. You will need to be flexible about the amount
of capital you can invest. This depends on the costs of the contracts
available that meet your requirements. You must order quickly after
receiving the list to beat other investors.
At auction. This is a much more specialist operation. The London-based firm
of Foster &amp; Cranfield has been holding monthly auctions of endowments and
reversions for more than a century. Here, you have to decide how much you
can pay and compete against other interested investors, although the company
will give guidance on a realistic price range. But you have to judge the
likely maturity values and the price worth paying. Most investors assume
that the life company will maintain its present bonus rates, both
reversionary and terminal. But under Lautro's marketing regulations, life
offices are no longer allowed to quote projected maturity values on their
present bonus rates for periods greater than five years, so you will
probably have to do your own calculations.
This is a straightforward exercise if you know the life company's present
bonus rates. You can then build up the amount of bonuses on the contract
year by year until maturity - an exercise that needs only a pocket
calculator.
To work out how much you are prepared to pay, you need to decide on the
minimum acceptable investment return after tax and then, using the estimated
maturity value, perform a complicated discounted cash flow calculation.
Unfortunately, though, bonus rates are not stable at present. There is a big
question mark hanging over the traditional life assurance industry's ability
to continue bonuses at their present level. Some offices have cut them
already and others may not be able to put off the day of reckoning for much
longer, according to analysts. And when the cuts are made, they could be
drastic.
This is of concern to potential investors in second-hand endowments who
could well receive less than they expected on maturity. The question is, how
much less?
This depends on the period before the endowment matures. A change in the
reversionary bonus rate will significantly affect only endowments maturing
in the longer term. But a cut in terminal bonuses will hit all policies.
Take Scottish Life, which reduced its reversionary bonus rates in 1991. The
estimated maturity value of a Scottish Life contract on Beale Dobie's list -
calculated on previous reversionary bonus rates of 13.90 per cent of the sum
assured and 17.20 per cent of attaching bonuses and the same terminal bonus
 -would be Pounds 32,718. This is a difference of around 1 per cent from the
new projected maturity pay-out of Pounds 32,413.
Investors would be far more concerned with a change in the terminal bonus
rate. A cut here could have a bigger impact on the ultimate maturity value
and the consequent investment return. In the above example, if the terminal
bonus rate was cut by about a quarter to 40 per cent, the maturity value
would be reduced by 8.5 per cent to Pounds 29,659 and the rate of return to
around 12 per cent.
Beale Dobie has produced a useful table for clients showing the sensitivity
of the rate of return to reductions in terminal bonus. But remember that the
eventual maturity payout could be less than the anticipated or calculated
figure.
Finally, tax can be payable on maturity. There are two cases to consider:
If it is a qualifying policy, you would be subject to capital gains tax. If
it is bought in joint names of husband and wife, the combined exemption can
be used.
If not, then you are subject to higher-rate tax on the profit, calculated on
the top slicing principle. So, an investor paying basic-rate tax only might
not be liable for tax on lower-sized contracts.
In either case, an investor would be better-off buying a series of smaller
endowments maturing in successive years, than one large endowment.
In theory, the buyer of an endowment should keep in touch with the original
owner of the contract because if that person dies before maturity, the
benefits would be payable to the investor earlier than anticipated. In
practice, the investor can wait until maturity - the death benefits are
lower than the final pay-out.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: BES wizards find cunning new routes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX SHELTERS have reached new levels of fiendish cunning just in time for
the Budget. Business expansion scheme financiers have worked out a route to
limit the 'downside' - and even go some of the way to ensuring an 'upside' -
on trading companies. Until the end of last week, this had been done only
with companies holding rented property.
Last week saw the first such launch: Friendly Stop Inns sponsored by MMI.
This week has brought not the last resort but the Johnson Fry Resort, which
will buy hotels for Resort Hotels; and BESSA Cash Backed, sponsored by Close
Brothers, which will buy standby safety vessels for Sunset Shipping, a North
Sea service company.
The schemes use different routes in their attempts to assure an exit. Close
Brothers' scheme is backed by a deposit held by Sunset Shipping in an
offshore account. If Sunset were to go into liquidation, the sponsors are
confident that BES investors would, at the end of five years, receive the
covenanted Pounds 1.32 for every Pounds 1 spent now. The Johnson Fry scheme
guarantees that, after five years, investors will receive as many shares in
Resort Hotels as could have been bought now with the money invested. This
allows the possibility of significant upside. There are some safeguards to
guard against the shares falling badly over the five years, or Resort Hotels
being taken over.
This week's more conventional offerings include Sun Life Besres VIII Campus,
which will go hunting for universities and housing associations interested
in entering into a 'buy-back' deal; and University of Surrey Residences,
sponsored by Downing Corporate Finance, which has a buy-back guarantee of
Pounds 1.35 after five years for every pre-tax Pounds 1 paid now. More
speculative offers include Wig and Pen, which will raise funds for the Wig
and Pen Club, a members' licensed dining club in The Strand, London. PiP
(Europe), a Hove-based company, is seeking funds for its interim management
practice, which provides managers to perform tasks while companies are
looking for new executives.
A number of the more attractive offers have sold out and Anthony Yadgaroff,
of the Allenbridge Group, suggests people take extra care when choosing a
scheme. The end of the tax year is close but decisions should not be rushed.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Commissions soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU bought a 25-year endowment policy from a tied agent last year, at
premiums of Pounds 50 a month, the chances are that you will end up paying
Pounds 570 in commission. A year previously, an exactly similar policy would
probably have cost Pounds 534 in commission.
This was one of the more startling conclusions from a survey of commissions
published last week by Lautro, the life industry's regulator. It showed that
commissions took a greater share of premiums last year, and that tied agents
tended to get more than independent advisers.
The old maximum commission agreement (MCA), which put caps on the
commissions paid on different life products, ended in December 1989,
although most companies still base their commissions on it. Competition for
distribution outlets then forced the life offices to offer bigger initial
commissions. These increases continued last year although renewal
commissions have remained broadly unchanged, at around 2.5 per cent.
But there are big variations in the levels of commission being paid. For
example, using the same assumptions as above for a Pounds 50-a-month,
25-year endowment, tied agents might have been paid as little as Pounds
435.60 (10 per cent above the old ceiling), or as much as Pounds 641.52 (a
thumping 62 per cent increase).
Insurers have been less generous in their payments to independent advisers.
Thus, if you had bought a similar policy from an IFA, it would on average
have cost Pounds 498 in commission (up from Pounds 486 the previous year).
Total variation is from Pounds 419.76 to Pounds 578.16.
The difference between IFAs and tied agents is more marked on pensions. IFAs
on average received 123 per cent of the MCA level for selling 10-year
pensions last year - exactly the same as in 1990. On 25-year policies, there
was a slight increase from 124 per cent to 126 per cent.
But tied agents received on average 144 per cent of the old rate for 10-year
policies (up from 131 per cent), and 140 per cent (up from 133 per cent) for
25-year pensions.
The upward pressure on commissions is much higher for products which include
an element of life assurance. Put Pounds 1,000 in a unit-linked single
premium bond and you would probably pay Pounds 58 to an appointed agent and
Pounds 52 to an IFA. The old maximum was Pounds 36. If you had put your
Pounds 1,000 into a unit trust, you would probably have paid a tied agent an
average of Pounds 32 (down from Pounds 33 the previous year), while IFAs
would have received Pounds 31. Under the MCA, you would have paid Pounds 30.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The money-makers - Cash unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH unit trusts sound like a contradiction in terms. Unit trusts normally
invest in equities, which carry the risk of a fall in the value of the
investor's capital. But cash unit trusts invest in the money markets, where
money is bought and sold for short periods by institutions.
The value of the trust rises as the interest on the deposits accrues. The
value of the units - and your holding - goes up in proportion. As they can
offer investors a high yield, cash unit trusts are an alternative to bank
and building society savings accounts.
RATES
'The advantage of a cash unit trust for the private investor is to gain
access to money market rates, which can be better than rates of interest
found elsewhere,' says Simon Ballard, marketing director of Morgan Grenfell.
Money market rates change daily but are usually around those of base rates,
now 10.5 per cent. When it is expected interest rates may fall, money market
rates are likely to be slightly below base rates - as is now the case.
Cash unit trusts are relatively new. Two started in 1989 and another eight
the following year. Most of the 34 operating today were launched in 1991 and
the total invested in them is Pounds 230.6m, according to figures from
Finstat.
Fidelity Investments has cornered about a quarter of the market, with its
trust standing at Pounds 58m. The fund invests only in bank deposits. A
credit analysis department selects the least risky banks with no more than
20 per cent invested in a single institution. The minimum investment is
Pounds 1,000 but those who keep Pounds 5,000 in the fund can have a cheque
book (cheques must be for a minimum of Pounds 250).
On Thursday, Fidelity was paying 10.28 per cent gross on Pounds 1,000 and
Morgan Grenfell 10.7 per cent. Daily rates are published in the Financial
Times under the Authorised Unit Trusts section. (The yield figures listed in
the table below indicate the current annualised rate of return from February
figures provided by Micropal).
Most cash unit trusts carry an annual management charge of 0.5 per cent,
which is deducted out of the trust's income. Rates quoted above are net of
this deduction.
There are still a few banks or building societies that offer better rates on
an amount as low as Pounds 1,000: Bradford and Bingley's Direct Premium
postal account, has been paying 10.95 per cent gross on a Pounds 1,000
minimum (but this will fall to 9.95 per cent on Monday). Wimbledon &amp; South
West Finance is paying 10.6 per cent gross (11.03 per cent CAR) on Pounds
1,000 in its High Interest (instant access) cheque account and Nottingham BS
is paying 10.65 per cent on its Post Direct instant access postal account
(minimum deposit Pounds 2,500).
Otherwise, the best available rates are 10 per cent gross on Caledonian
Bank's High Interest current account and Co-Op's Pathfinder account (10.5
per cent CAR). Southdown building society's Supersaver account is paying 9.7
per cent gross. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester pays 10.4 per cent on its London
Share postal account, although the minimum deposit is Pounds 2,500. Most
other accounts are paying well below base rates. Lloyds, with 8.5 per cent
gross on its instant savings account, offers the best rate of the Big Four
on Pounds 1,000. (This is due to drop to 8 per cent on March 2).
Some bank and building society savings accounts will pay rates competitive
with, or better than, those on the money market; but these tend to be on
amounts of at least Pounds 2,500 or on a minimum notice period of 28 days
and more (usually, 90 days). And banks and building societies can offer
accounts which are competitive one day and less so the next - without
investors being told of the change.
Withdrawing your money from a cash unit trust operates similarly to postal
accounts. Fidelity, Morgan Grenfell and Scottish Amicable provide customers
with withdrawal slips which you post, and cheques are sent three or four
days later. Fidelity will, at no extra cost, arrange for a telegraphic
transfer the day after it receives the withdrawal form. If the depositor has
more than Pounds 5,000, he can use the cheque book to settle bills or to pay
money into a current account.
CHARGES
There is no initial charge on most cash unit trusts, compared with the
normal charge on a unit trust is 5-6 per cent. Only 10 managers still retain
a front-end charge on their funds, including Scottish Amicable. Yet, despite
this seeming to be a disadvantage, Scottish Amicable has the second-largest
share of the market, with Pounds 33.6m in its Maximum Income cash unit trust
(minimum investment Pounds 5,000 and Thursday's yield was 9.9 per cent).
The initial charge is 2.5 per cent and there is an 0.5 per cent annual
management charge on top. 'We launched at a time when no one thought of
offering a unit trust without a charge,' says a Scottish Amicable spokesman.
'The whole bid/offer spread was a policy decision to create a unit trust
rather than a fund. But I would not be surprised if the decision were to be
reversed.'
Scottish Amicable created the fund to take advantage of the move to
independent taxation in 1990, when it became possible for a non-taxpaying
spouse to receive income gross. However, the abolition of composite rate tax
has changed the market since then.
Banks and building societies now can pay income gross without the need to
reclaim tax, giving them an advantage over cash unit trusts if their
accountholders are non-taxpayers. Cash unit trusts cannot pay income gross,
although the investor can reclaim the tax in the usual manner.
Investors with cash unit trusts are protected by the investor's compensation
scheme, which provides a maximum of Pounds 48,000.

<TEXT>
AT BICC, the cables and construction group, the impact of recessions in
North America, Australia and the UK was previously softened by the
resilience of the continental cables market. But last year that stronghold
began to weaken and pre-tax profits are expected to have fallen to around
Pounds 100m from (Pounds 183m).
The range of estimates ahead of Wednesday's announcement is quite wide
because of uncertainty about the level of exceptional charges for such
things as property write-downs and reorganisation. Other areas of doubt
include the margin-squeeze at Balfour Beatty, the construction wing, and the
state of the balance sheet.
General Accident, the general and life insurer, reports its 1991 results on
Tuesday. Like Commercial Union and Royal Insurance, GA is expected to post
losses. However, the company's exposure to mortgage indemnity losses, which
contributed heavily to Royal's disastrous performance this week, is limited.
Even so the company's underlying trading performance is weak and losses for
1991 are expected to be around Pounds 160m, compared with Pounds 121m last
year.
GKN, the motor components and industrial services group, is expected to show
on Wednesday pre-tax profits virtually halved from Pounds 172m in 1990 to
between Pounds 85m and Pounds 90m last year. Among the charges is the cost
of job cuts, and that process is expected to continue.
With most of its continental European markets turning down alongside the UK
and US, the few cushioning factors have included its involvement in new
models. GKN is credited with good cash conservation and the dividend is
thought to be safe although uncovered.
Cadbury Schweppes' premium rating among food-processing shares will be put
to the test when it reports full-year results on Wednesday. Though last
year's overall growth in UK confectionery and soft drinks volumes was
unexciting, the company is thought to have benefited from a last-minute
pre-Christmas buying surge and from steady price increases on the drinks
side. Analysts' forecasts range from Pounds 310m to Pounds 316m pre-tax, up
from Pounds 279.6m in 1990.
Ladbroke, the leisure group, is expected to report on Thursday a one-third
fall in pre-tax profits to around Pounds 210m (Pounds 305m). Three of its
four divisions - hotels, betting and retail - will be worse off. Only Texas,
the DIY chain, will be ahead. Property disposal profits and lower interest
charges thanks to its August rights issue, will help offset the weak trading
performance. The full-year dividend will probably show a modest rise from
10.6p to around 11p.
On Tuesday Abbey National, the retail banking group, is expected to announce
pre-tax profits for 1991 between Pounds 610m and Pounds 630m, up from Pounds
582m a year ago. This would make it the second most profitable bank in the
UK, a whisker behind Lloyds (Pounds 645m) but comfortably ahead of Barclays
(Pounds 533m). Provisions against loan losses will be sharply up from last
year's Pounds 55m.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Time to try a tracker fund?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRACKER funds have until now offered the simplest way to lift the 'load' of
unit trust charges, writes John Authers. They do this by removing one of the
biggest expenses - the cost of active fund management. Tracker funds make no
attempt to 'beat' bench-mark indices. Instead, they use complicated
quantitative techniques to mirror the performance of the index as closely as
possible.
In some cases this just means 'replicating' the index by buying holdings in
every share in the index (in the correct proportions). Others carefully
choose a basket of shares which have in the past shown a tendency to track
the index, with occasional adjustments to reflect changes in index
weightings.
Once established, a good part of the management of an index fund can be left
to the discretion of the computer. In the UK, this means that annual
management charges are significantly lower than on other trusts. For
example, Gartmore and James Capel both only charge 0.5 per cent.
Leaders in the field so far include James Capel and Legal &amp; General, both of
which now have strong quantitative teams, and Gartmore.
Initial charges tend to be up with the industry's average - for example,
James Capel charges 5.25 per cent at the front end, while Legal &amp; General
charges 5 per cent. However, Gartmore's front-end load is well below the
average - 3.75 per cent - and its chairman Paul Myners does not rule out
lowering this further if the group's costs can justify it.
Nobody, however, seems to view tracker funds as a route to US-style 'no
load' funds. Rather, they are viewed as an aid to portfolio management -
individuals or institutions can guarantee that a substantial ballast of
their portfolio will mirror the index, and then rely on 'satellite'
investments to add value.
Michael Hayden of L&amp;G says: 'We believe they are building blocks for
independent financial advisers. They are core holdings to give you exposure
to the market as a whole.'
However, a big point in favour of trackers is that mainstream unit trust
performance currently looks dismal. They are trying to beat the indices, but
conspicuously failing to do so. This makes the lower management fees of
index funds look much more appealing.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Lifting the load of unit trust charges
 -A look at the impact of a bold move by Murray Johnstone in cutting its
initial fees for fund management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRESH air of competition was brought into the unit trust market this
week - and investors can reap the benefits. Murray Johnstone has cut the
initial charge on its range of unit trusts from 5 to 1 per cent, which will
bring immediate savings to new investors.
The initial charge is one of two key factors which make up the spread
between bid and offer prices. The other is the cost of dealing in the shares
which the trust owns.
By cutting the initial charge, this spread between bid and offer prices will
be reduced sharply, as the table below shows. This means that a unitholder's
investment will have a smaller hurdle to surmount before he makes a profit.
If charges fall across the industry, returns to investors should increase.
The effect on Murray Johnstone's trusts was seen in a fall in offer prices.
The price of its equity income fund - 83.7p at Tuesday's opening, before the
change - fell immediately to 81.31p. The bid price, however, rose from
78.43p to 78.94p.
This spread looks a lot better than the rest of the industry. On February 1,
the average spread on all non-cash unit trusts was 6 per cent, according to
Finstat. So, an investor who buys into a Murray Johnstone unit trust is
making an average saving of between 1.8 and 4.2 per cent.
The initial charge on a unit trust personal equity plan from Murray
Johnstone will also fall, from 5 to 1.5 per cent.
Murray Johnstone is not being entirely altruistic. It is increasing the
annual management charge on the trusts from 1 to 1.5 per cent as part
compensation for its reduced initial charge. But an annual charge of 1.5 per
cent is not out of line with much of the sector.
Existing Murray Johnstone unitholders might not see the move as entirely
beneficial; they have already paid the 5 per cent initial charge and now
face a rise in annual charges. But they will be offered an extra discount of
0.5 per cent - bringing the initial charge down to 0.5 per cent - on any new
funds in which they invest. They might also expect to benefit if large
numbers of new unitholders are attracted, as growing funds are expected to
perform better than shrinking funds.
The Murray Johnstone initiative certainly is against the industry trend.
Over the past few years charges have tended to rise, not fall, with initial
fees edging up from 5 to 6 per cent and annual fees from 1 to 1.5 per cent.
Lazards already offers funds with no initial charge, but these require a
minimum investment of Pounds 5,000. Some cash trusts also have no initial
charge. But Murray Johnstone is offering its service across a wide range of
funds and on a minimum of just Pounds 500.
In the US, a large number of mutual funds (the equivalent of unit trusts)
have reduced or no initial charges, and are known as 'no-load' or
'low-load.' But the UK industry has not moved in the same direction because
of the difficulty in selling such funds.
Unit trusts are sold mainly through tied agents and independent financial
advisers, who are offered a 3 per cent commission on each deal. The
commission is the main component of the initial charge. Without it, there is
no incentive for advisers to recommend a trust - and that will be the main
barrier to Murray Johnstone making a success of its radical move.
The company is, however, offering a renewal commission of 0.5 per cent to
advisers who keep client money within the group's trusts for a year. This
commission will be paid out of the group's annual management fee and is
designed to encourage long-term investment.
Although Murray Johnstone reported an encouraging reaction from advisers
this week, it may need to rely on those few advisers who charge a fee (see
companion piece), or investors who buy trusts direct. The latter can do so
by ringing 0345-090-933 or by writing to Murray Johnstone for further
information at 7 West Nile Street, Glasgow G2 2PX.
Other fund managers doubtless will claim that they can produce better
investment performance than Murray Johnstone, Thus, their unitholders will
prosper in the long run, despite the higher initial charges. And it is true
that while the three-year performance of Murray's unit trusts (shown in the
table) is not dreadful, neither is it particularly impressive.
Ignoring the cash fund, only two Murray Johnstone funds have a top quartile
(best 25 per cent) sector performance, with one of those being the tiny UK
growth trust. But performance has been improving. Over the (admittedly
short) one-year period, eight out of nine funds have produced above-average
growth for their sectors. And the group's short-term performance should be
given a boost by the reduction in the initial charge.
Over the long term, it could be that those funds which retain a 1 per cent
annual management fee, but a higher initial charge, turn out to be offering
better value. But Murray Johnstone's bold move has to be welcomed by anyone
who wants to see greater competition in the financial services market.

<TEXT>
IT IS possible to reduce the initial charge you pay on unit trusts without
relying solely on the fund management expertise of Murray Johnstone, writes
Philip Coggan.
Investors with substantial sums have long been able to negotiate reduced
charges from companies, and larger IFAs have used financial 'muscle' to get
lower spreads for clients.
A new group of fee-charging advisers is also emerging. Some will advise on
unit trusts as part of an overall package; the price you pay will depend on
the work and the time involved. It is important not to believe that you are
paying 'extra' by writing a separate cheque for a fee; commission also comes
from your pocket, only in a less obvious manner.
Other fee-based advisers are offering execution-only services; for example,
Chamberlain de Broe (071-235-5999) charges a flat fee of Pounds 50 and
Boyton Financial Services (0787-61919) Pounds 60. Such services are cheaper
than paying 3 per cent commission if one is investing more than Pounds
2,000.
Execution-only services are designed for those who have already made their
mind up about unit trust selection. Those who need advice will have to pay
for it; one could argue that a 3 per cent commission is not an unreasonable
charge to pay for good advice.
The snag is whether 'good advice' is what will be received. Efficient market
theory would assume that the average IFA selects trusts with an average
performance. The trick is to select the above average IFA, and that could be
as difficult as selecting an above average unit trust.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eagle Star Life has announced reduced reversionary and terminal bonuses on
its endowment and pension policies. Using the standard industry assumptions
that a policy was started by a 29-year-old man investing Pounds 30 per
month, 10-year pay-outs dropped from Pounds 7,449 to Pounds 6,896, while
25-year maturity values fell from Pounds 62,785 to Pounds 61,910. This is in
line with the industrial trend for 10-year policies to see a much sharper
cut than 25-year contracts.

Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust, the UK's largest trust, this week
announced an 11.6 per cent increase in its final dividend, the 21st annual
increase. Net assets per share rose 21.6 per cent in 1991. The graph shows
how the trust has outperformed the All-Share during much of the 1980s,
thanks in part to a narrowing of the discount to net assets. Since 1965,
Foreign &amp; Colonial's share price has grown 2,133 per cent, while the
All-Share has risen by 470 per cent.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At A Glance): Gloom for building
societies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was not much in the way of good news in figures released by the
building societies association this week. The best was a modest upturn in
net receipts to Pounds 293m in January after two months of net outflows - a
far cry from the Pounds 934m in net receipts in January 1991 and the year's
peak of Pounds 1.3bn in April.
Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said
last month's inflow of money 'owed much to the first anniversary of Tessa
accounts. The underlying flow of savings remains subdued and this pattern
seems set to continue for the foreseeable future.' There was little sign of
improvement in the societies' mortgage business either. Net new lending at
Pounds 2.27bn in January was down from Pounds 2.53bn in December.

YOU KNOW those mornings when you wake up and you just want the world to go
away? Well, Royal Insurance knows all about that - and this week it
announced that it had found a temporary fix.
It has hedged 'a chunky proportion' of one of its UK share portfolios
against the risk of a sharp decline, for example during the election period.
So for those responsible for this part of the Royal's equity portfolio, the
world has suddenly become a place where only good news matters.
For the rest of us, alas, the good and bad come mixed together. And among
this week's bad news was Thursday's announcement from - surprise] - Royal
Insurance that it was passing its final dividend because it had made pre-tax
losses of Pounds 373m in 1991. The share price dropped 16 per cent on
Thursday to 190p. It dropped further on Friday, to close at 183p, down 36p
on the week.
Royal's terrible results lie behind its decision to hedge last autumn. The
balance sheet of its UK general insurance operations (known as Royal UK) has
been badly weakened by losses, particularly on policies that insure building
societies against defaulting mortgage-holders. 'When one's balance sheet is
at these levels, one has to say 'what sort of risks are there that could
make the position worse?'' says David Barker, managing director of Royal
Insurance Asset Management.
One obvious risk is a drop in the stock market, which could affect the value
of the Pounds 400m or so in Royal UK's equity portfolio. This is roughly a
sixth of Royal UK's portfolio - the rest is in cash, short-term
fixed-interest securities or property. 'We took the view that if there was a
risk that a significant bear market would do further damage to the balance
sheet, we should explore ways of protecting ourselves,' says Barker.
The way they came up with was to buy a 'contract of differences' with some
unspecified counterparty, presumably another financial institution. 'Below a
certain figure on the FT-SE,' says Barker, 'they have to pay us money for
every point of difference on the FT-SE scale.'
Royal paid an upfront premium for this contract in the autumn, says Barker,
'when FT-SE was higher than it is today.' FT-SE reached its highest point in
September, when it touched 2667.4. The contract can be traded, and its value
therefore goes up whenever FT-SE moves closer to the magic figure. So Barker
must have had a cheerful December, when the index dropped to a recent low of
2345.4. It closed on Friday at 2562.1, a gain of 19.8 on the week.
Barker fully expects the contract to expire worthless, sometime after the
election, since his view is that the stock market will be appreciably higher
towards the end of the year than it is today. The contract should be
regarded as 'investment reinsurance', he says: 'The chances are we won't get
anything, but that doesn't stop you insuring your car.' So they paid their
money and slept more peacefully at night.
Others enjoying more restful sleep this week were the directors of Midland
Bank, who avoided the dire fate, widely predicted in the City, of passing
their final dividend. Midland managed to pay the same (reduced) final
dividend as in the year before. Its share price rose 21p to 260p. Dividends
were also the subject of much boardroom discussion at Barclays Bank, where
the directors seriously considered cutting the final payout. In the event,
they ate into reserves, and held the dividend.
One encouraging sign was that in the second half of the year, Midland's bad
debt charge fell. So did Barclays', but by a proportionately smaller amount.
Barclays' share price ended Friday at 361p, down 27p on the week. Since the
stock market peaked in September, Barclays has underperformed the
FT-Actuaries All-Share index by 19 per cent; Midland has outperformed it by
7 per cent.
Results of other big companies reporting this week came in more or less in
line with expectations. Before the results season started Warburg Securities
had expected the 22 big companies that have so far reported to show
full-year pre-tax profit declines of 8 per cent, on average, and that's
exactly the figure that they came in at. Nothing to disturb the sleep of the
unhedged investor there.
Anyone who owns shares in Lonrho is probably used to the odd disturbed
night, since the shares have halved in value in four months. This week's
insomnia offering was the discovery that behind the group's poor preliminary
results lay some even less encouraging annual report details: profits,
already down sharply, would have been lower still without the Pounds 33m
gained from disposals of property and the Pounds 27m of capitalised
interest. The shares closed the week at 117p, down 12 1/2 p.
Results aside, the main influence on nocturnal activity these days is the
electoral outlook. The Greek chorus of political pundits, after awarding the
first round of this potential seven-round bout, in January, to the
Conservatives, marked the February round to Labour. The stock market
appeared to regard the slight adjustment of the odds with equanimity; the
economic risks of a possible giveaway Budget were apparently offset by the
political advantages it might offer to the Conservatives. The Bank of
England signalled several times during the week that an interest rate cut
was unlikely before the Budget, now ten days away. The money market appeared
confident that it would come promptly then, however.
All in all, a week that could have offered plenty of reasons for staying in
bed, had passed without too much bad news. Most individual investors -
lacking the Royal's technical expertise in hedging, or its pressing need to
do so - will be happy for the rest of the results season and the electoral
campaign to go the same way.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Seeking value in fields of conflict -
Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VALUE for money should be the consumers' battle cry in the financial
services market of the 1990s. It is a concept that can be applied to many
different financial products.
Take the reduction in unit trust initial charges announced this week by
Murray Johnstone, which we cover in depth on Page III.
With so many companies chasing investors' money, it was perhaps inevitable
that groups would start to compete on price.
Charging systems such as Murray Johnstone's are two-a-cent in the US, where
investors have a wide choice of so-called 'low-load' or 'no-load' funds. In
the UK, there is very little variation in unit trust charging structures.
Indeed, over the past few years, charges have risen while average
performance has been poor; and the two facts may well be connected.
Over the past five years, the average unit trust manager has failed to beat
the indices, inflation or, indeed, the building society. Does it make sense
to pay people to sit in expensive City office blocks when a computer,
programmed to match the index, could be both better and cheaper?
Perhaps there is a case for paying a premium price to companies which can
outperform the index consistently; and for those which cannot beat the index
to charge a lower fee until they can improve their returns. Such a system
would be closer to offering investors value for money.
Indeed, there is a general point here. For years, some of those working in
the City were earning vast salaries. The best and the brightest of the
nation's youth were lured away from industry and into the Square Mile.
The problem has been that, in a free market, the financial services sector
has not been generating the profits to justify such high salaries. The 1987
crash was one body blow; the recession has been the next.
Whatever the reason, the sector's costs are too high. The banks, in
particular, which face bad debt problems on their personal and corporate
loans, are being forced to cut back. (Of course, the lion's share of job
cuts will fall on the modestly-paid branch staff).
But the cost structures of the High Street banks mean that consumers can
obtain better value elsewhere across a range of services.
A good example is the cash unit trust sector described on Page IV; but the
same phenomenon can be seen in credit cards and high-interest cheque
accounts. Inertia is probably the main factor that still binds many
customers to the Big Four.
Value for money is a theme we have also been trying to emphasise in covering
the life assurance sector. Those who maintain their endowment policies to
maturity seem to get good value (although other options may have done
better); and there can be little doubt that those who surrender them in
early years do not.
One of our consistent criticisms of life products is that consumers do not
receive information on their costs and penalties in a form that most people
would understand easily. Without information, it is hard to get value for
money.
How might that information be presented? Perhaps a rough abbreviation of
what the adviser or salesman could say would run as follows.
'I think you need life insurance and a savings scheme. You can bundle them
together in one product called an endowment policy, in which case the
insurance element costs you Pounds x a month and the life element Pounds y.
'Or you can take out term assurance and a unit or investment trust savings
plan at Pounds a and Pounds b a month.
'On past evidence, this is what the average endowment policy with that
premium has been worth if cashed-in after two, five, 10, 15, 20 and 25
years. The average unit and investment trust savings schemes over those same
periods has been worth this much.
'There is a greater element of security in the endowment policy, plus a
steady increase in the amount of life assurance. The unit or investment
trust savings scheme is more flexible and, if personal equity plans
continue, has a more favourable tax position.
'Would you like the security or the flexibility? If you don't think you can
keep up the payments, then the inflexibility of the endowment is a
disadvantage.
'If you are a cautious sort, who is conscientious about meeting commitments,
the endowment will probably be better for you.
'I should tell you that I will receive more income in commission, which
comes out of your pocket, if you buy an endowment rather than the other
policies.'
One could quibble with the details (and no doubt I will get some letters
doing just that), but that might be an approximation of the style and
substance of a 'value for money' piece of advice.
Having said that, I still believe that FT readers will benefit from
approaching an adviser who charges a fee. Such advisers have a commonality
of interests with their clients; the commission system creates potential
conflicts of interest all the time.
No doubt many honest advisers surmount it, but the conflict is there all the
same.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Markets: Dow carried upwards by a tide of cash - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORGET THE economy, corporate profits and election-year politics, the stock
market is being propped up by sheer weight of money.
Share prices have been on a record-breaking spree since New Year because
investors have been pouring money into stocks, creating a pool of buyers
that is supporting prices irrespective of the fundamentals of the market.
Look at the numbers supplied this week by the Investment Company Institute,
the trade group for US mutual funds. In December investors handed over a
record Dollars 7.4bn (Pounds 4.22bn) to stock mutual funds. January was not
far behind, as another Dollars 6.7bn, the second-largest inflow ever, was
put in stock funds. February, by all accounts, could come close to matching
both.
The money managers have not stopped to think about what to do with it all.
They have taken the money and put it straight in the market.
In fact, they have done more than that. The data shows that in January the
funds invested a net Dollars 7.8bn in common stocks. This means that the
professional investment managers invested all the money given to them in
January, plus an additional Dollars 1.1bn from their stock of cash. By the
end of last month, the percentage of assets stock-funds held as cash stood
at 7.9 per cent, the lowest level in eight years.
Superficially, the key factor behind cash flows appears to be interest
rates. The money that has been going into stock funds and the market has
primarily come from assets such as bank certificates of deposit, savings
accounts and short-term money market funds which yield less as interest
rates fall. Interest rates were on a downward path throughout 1991, but the
final straw for yield-sensitive investors appears to have been the Federal
Reserve's one percentage point cut in the discount rate on December 20. This
prompted a big switch into equities by investors unhappy with the low yields
on alternative short-term assets.
Yet the rush into stocks may be about more than just interest rates and
relative returns on financial assets. Some observers believe investors'
new-found appetite for equities may reflect a secular, rather than a
cyclical, trend.
It can be argued that investors are putting money in stocks for the
long-term, and not just punting on interest rates or betting on a short-term
rebound in the economy and corporate earnings. In particular, the baby-boom
generation - people born in the 1950s and 1960s who have careers and
families - may view equities as an important element in their long-term
savings plans.
The financial services industry is certainly keen to encourage such
thinking. A recent spate of television commercials by broker-managers such
as PaineWebber, Dean Witter, and Merrill Lynch, and by traditional fund
groups such as Fidelity, have been aimed at persuading the heads of young
families to prepare for their childrens' future and their own retirement by
investing in long-term stock funds now. Thus, in spite of the well-known
risks of investing in equities, investors are being told that the market
offers long-term protection for savings capital.
There is some evidence to suggest that investors are swallowing this.
According to Strategic Insight, a New York-based mutual fund consultancy, 80
per cent of the money put into stock funds this year has been invested with
just 56 funds, the majority having built their success and reputation
providing investors with a healthy return over the long-term. Another 530
stock funds have suffered net outflows of cash during the same period.
If attitudes to equities are genuinely changing, and more investors settling
in for the long-haul, the market may become less sensitive to the short-term
external influences that disrupts sentiment and feeds volatility.
There was plenty of volatility in the market this week, however, as the Dow
index reached a record high on twice only to fall back sharply the following
day. The uncertainty was created by conflicting economic news.
On Tuesday, the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence fell in
January to the lowest level since 1974. The next day the Commerce department
reported that factor orders for durable goods rose 1.5 per cent in January,
a bigger rise than expected. On Thursday weekly jobless claims showed a rise
in unemployment. Yesterday brought a rise in the University of Michigan's
survey of consumer confidence and an unexpectedly large upward revision in
fourth-quarter GDP growth.
Amid all this confusing data, no wonder more investors seem happy to leave
their money in the market for the long-term.

FT  29 FEB 92 / The Long View: Board room botheration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE ARE conditioned to accept corporate absurdities, but it cannot pass
without comment that this week large companies such as Barclays Bank and
Commercial Union have declared unchanged or even higher dividends in spite
of collapses in their profits, and moreover, slumps that cannot be regarded
as one-off aberrations. The question of corporate governance in Britain
deserves to be raised again.
As it happens, in two or three months' time the subject will be aired in
depth by the Cadbury Committee of the great and the good. In the meantime,
however, I was intrigued by the debate at the National Association of
Pension Funds investment conference this week between Sir Owen Green,
chairman of BTR, and Mike Sandland, investment chief of Norwich Union.
Debates between extremists serve to dramatise issues but not always to
illuminate them. In this case we had an aggressive industrialist, happy to
speak his mind and stand on his record, and a more defensive institutional
investor; Sandland is currently chairman of the Institutional Shareholders'
Committee, a Bank of England-backed pressure group of fund managers, and is
therefore at the focus of investment politics.
It was easy to see what Green wanted: shareholders should leave companies
well alone, perhaps however with the protection of better information to
improve their investment decisions. The argument sounds more convincing when
coming from a successful manager than when given by somebody from, say,
British Aerospace or even Polly Peck.
Sandland's agenda was rather more hidden. His committee has been issuing
recommendations that institutions should start to take their
responsibilities as shareholders more seriously, but many fund managers
remain apathetic, particularly in relation to votes on routine issues. The
ISC has also urged companies to appoint independent non-executive directors,
although there is little evidence that they do a lot of good in practice.
Just as Green's mission appeared to be to increase, or at any rate preserve,
the power of managers, Sandland seemed to be battling to protect the role of
institutional investors. But corporate governance deserves to be debated
from a broader point of view. That pension fund and life insurance fund
managers have got themselves into this position is really quite a recent
phenomenon. In the 1950s two-thirds of company shares were directly held by
private investors and under a fifth by institutions. Today those proportions
are approximately reversed.
The difference as far as corporate governance is concerned is that whereas
small investors can freely sell the shares of companies they no longer like
and can buy others, big fund managers may find themselves locked in. This is
partly because the market is not liquid enough to accommodate the selling
and buying orders without imposing a big price penalty. It is also because
big, semi-permanent shareholders are often expected - rightly or wrongly -
to exercise some kind of proprietorship role.
This problem flared up in the late 1980s when a wave of hostile takeovers
left many company managements feeling exposed and betrayed, and the
investment institutions wilted under the barrage of criticism over their
'short-termism', by which was often meant their inability to understand the
true long-term worth of companies.
As I have said before in this column, such accusations have been in one
important respect misplaced. The big distortion of the capital market at
that time lay in the behaviour of the banks, not that of the investment
institutions. Banks financed acquisitions at ridiculous prices, often twice
the stock market value of companies. The cost of this is now emerging in
bank financial statements, as in this week's near Pounds 2bn annual bad debt
provision by National Westminster. It was quite rational of long-term
institutions to take advantage of this mispricing.
In another respect, however, the beleaguered companies were justified in
pointing up the anomaly that the big institutions had acquired a dominant
position on the shareholder registers and were demanding more information
and recognition, but were themselves bringing little to the party.
Big shareholders were in fact trying to behave just like the little
investors they had replaced. People like Mike Sandland are attempting to
persuade the men from the Pru, the Pearl and the Widows to behave as though
they were responsible proprietors. But their main contribution is in
encouraging companies to pay excessive dividends, which is scarcely how
proprietors ought to behave. It seems to me that the whole approach is
misconceived, and is the consequence of fears in the City of London, not
least at the Bank of England, that a power vacuum is developing that will be
filled by some other economic or political interest group if the
institutional investors fail to wake up.
Inevitably the institutional debate is self-centred: it tends to be about
shareholders' rights rather than how companies could best be governed. The
independent director is promoted as a substitute for the supportive
proprietor: fund managers may come and go from the share register but the
non-exec representatives will remain.
But who are these non-executives, and exactly what are they independent of?
The idea of having compensation sub-committees to determine executive pay
seems to have been a bit of a disaster in practice, because executives of
some companies acting as non-executives in others have simply approved each
others' soaring pay deals. And company bosses like Sir Owen Green naturally
do not want spies and snoopers in the boardroom but committed supporters, or
at any rate people who clearly represent important stakeholders who can
contribute something.
I have no idea what the Cadbury Committee will say, but I hope it will
address the need to broaden the input into company boardrooms and to get the
institutions off the hook of voting obligations which they cannot live up to
but which they are terrified of losing to other interests. Certainly,
British companies do not need boardrooms packed with traditional
non-executive directors who advise that dividends should be paid regardless
of the trading circumstances.

FT  29 FEB 92 / The golden age of rail that never was: Once upon a time the
UK's trains were clean, fast and always ran on time - or did they?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLDEN age of rail, they call it: the days when the servants of the
railways took pride in their work, when glorious steam engines were turned
out for their journeys with paint gleaming and copper burnished brightly,
when courteous porters carried people's bags to their carriages for 6d, and
 -most of all - when you could set your watch by the departures and arrivals
of the trains.
Today, a journey by state-owned British Rail is more likely to be perceived
as an ordeal than a pleasure. Trains and stations are dirty and run down;
employees, where they can be found at all, are surly and unhelpful; the
railways are riddled with inexplicable irritants, such as the closure of
restaurant cars long before the journey's end; and - worst of all - services
are delayed or cancelled, often without explanation.
Now, at last, all this could seemingly change. The Conservatives are about
to go to the country with a manifesto commitment to break up and privatise
British Rail in the lifetime of the next parliament. The details have yet to
be worked out, but prime minister John Major is said to favour splitting BR
up into the old regional companies such as the Great Western and the London
&amp; North Eastern. Whatever method is chosen, it will be sold to voters as the
dawn of a new golden age for rail under private ownership.
And yet . . . the suspicion remains that this is just too good to be true.
Was the last golden age really all it is cracked up to have been? Was it not
the prime minister's favourite author, Trollope, who, as long ago as 1869,
observed in his novel He Knew He Was Right: 'The real disgrace of England is
the railway sandwich'?
Doubts are reinforced by recollections of the frequency with which railways,
then as now, were ridiculed. A recent letter to a UK national newspaper
recalled a pre-war music hall joke about the man who tried to commit suicide
by lying across the tracks of the Southern Railway, only to die of
starvation. And constant fun was had at the expense of the old railway
companies' initials. The LNER (London &amp; North Eastern Railway) was known as
the Late &amp; Never Early; the LMS (London Midland &amp; Scottish) as the 'Elluva
Mess; the S&amp;D (Somerset &amp; Dorset) as the Slow &amp; Dirty; and the MS&amp;L
(Manchester Sheffield &amp; Lincolnshire) as the Money Sunk &amp; Lost.
It would be unfair to draw comparisons with the earliest days of rail - the
days of the 1830s when second and third class passengers travelled
uncomfortably in open wagons, competing for space at the opposite end of the
train from the steam locomotive for fear of an explosion.
But even after the rapid expansion of the network, triggered by the railway
mania of the mid-1840s, history suggests that the intense competition which
resulted did little to promote either technological progress or higher
standards of service for the customer.
One vociferous critic of the Victorian railways was the novelist Charles
Dickens. In Letters (1856), he describes a stop at Peterborough station in
Cambridgeshire: 'The lady in the refreshment room . . . gave me a cup of
tea, as if I were a hyena and she my cruel keeper with a strong dislike to
me. I . . . had a petrified bun of enormous antiquity in miserable
meekness.'
Thus, the creation of the British Rail sandwich long anticipated the
creation of British Rail. But railway catering, although a frequent source
of complaint, was not the only one. Professor Jack Simmons, Britain's
pre-eminent historian of the Victorian railways, tells of many more
weaknesses and absurdities.
In The Railways of Britain, for example, he describes the search for an
effective way of telling passengers which station they had reached. Some
companies put illuminated signs on the platforms, but the practice was not
universal: on the Edinburgh &amp; Glasgow Railway, starlings and parrots were
trained to scream the names of stations. 'This device did not meet with
general favour,' Simmons notes.
More important, standards of passenger accommodation lagged far behind the
available technology. Always with an eye to profit, Victorian railway
companies were loath to fritter away money on luxuries such as heating and
lighting in carriages, still less on refreshment cars or even lavatories. As
a result, big intermediate stations such as Swindon, Preston and York saw
frenzied activity when main-line trains arrived as hundreds disembarked to
seek comfort and relief.
Eventually, long-distance trains did improve as companies began to emulate
higher standards set by the aggressively competitive Midland Railway in the
1870s. But shorter-distance and commuter services remained impervious to
such influences. As Simmons relates in The Victorian Railway: 'Two of the
most notoriously intense competitors in this business, the South Eastern and
the London Chatham &amp; Dover companies, were both also notorious for the
badness of the accommodation they offered; their neighbour, the London
Brighton &amp; South Coast, which competed with them too, was not in this
respect much better.'
Even in first and second class, heating and lighting were rare on commuter
trains before 1900. As for third class passengers, they were probably in too
much pain to notice that such amenities were missing. Trains in those days
were divided into compartments, each intended to seat 10 or 12 people. In
practice, they often held 30. Simmons explains: 'On the Walthamstow (north
London) line, it was accepted that boys travelled in the luggage racks.'
Timekeeping was equally poor. By the late 1880s, members of parliament had
become so angry about poor punctuality that they forced the published
arrival times of all trains at London terminals to be put back in an attempt
to make them more realistic. The worst offenders - then, as now - were
commuter services running into Victoria, Charing Cross and London Bridge
There were many other sources of concern. Geoffrey Body, an author and
former railwayman, records in his book The Railway Era that letters to
newspapers complained of rude employees, cancelled trains, fare anomalies,
and even having to show one's ticket too often (' . . . six times between
Charing Cross and Maidstone . . . '). One letter, headed 'Sixty miles on a
broken spring', protested about the discomfort of a journey from Faversham,
Kent, to Herne Hill, south London. Significantly, the writer of this last
letter went on to say that attempts to halt the train with the communication
cord had proved futile. In The Victorian Railway, Simmons chronicles in
disturbing detail how the companies were reluctant to give safety the
priority it warranted. Cost was the reason, and frequent disasters the
result. One victim was Dickens, who was shaken very badly by an accident
that killed 10 fellow-passengers on the South Eastern Railway on June 9
1865. He never fully recovered, and died five years later to the day.
Surely, though, some good came out of the competition? What about train
speeds? What about those legendary races to the north in which rival
companies vied to see which could get from London to Scotland the fastest?
Alas, reality has become clouded by myth. Yes, there were two bouts of keen
competition on Anglo-Scottish routes, in 1888 and 1895, but they were no
more than stunts: the competition was much too costly to sustain. ('More
haste, less dividend' was the caption to a Punch cartoon of 1888.) After
1895, the companies involved agreed not to undercut a journey time of 8 hr
15 min from London to Edinburgh or Glasgow. This stultifying bar on
competition remained in force till 1932.
Elsewhere, too, competition resulted more often in cartels than improvements
in speeds. One example was Portsmouth, served by two companies using
different routes from London. In spite of the scope for rivalry, the 1913
timetable shows that Portsmouth had the slowest train service of any city in
Britain. Conversely, the fastest trains in the timetable were those running
on the Great Western Railway between London and Bristol - a route on which
there was no competition.
Their manifest shortcomings aside, the Victorian railways did have one
virtue: they made money. Facing little or no competition from other modes of
transport, the larger companies usually managed to pay acceptable dividends
to shareholders. Once the speculative frenzy of the mid-1840s had passed,
railway shares came to be regarded as safe, if unspectacular, investments.
But it was too good to last. Even before the First World War, the railways
had started losing their suburban passengers to electric trams. Then came
the war, during which the railways were put under state control and came
under enormous strain. Afterwards, in 1923, an attempt was made to restore
the railways' prosperity by grouping the 120 independent operators into four
big regional companies: the London Midland &amp; Scottish, the London &amp; North
Eastern, the Great Western and the Southern.
Train-spotters look on the era that followed as the golden age of rail
because they associate it with the last great steam locomotives and crack
express trains such as the Flying Scotsman and the Golden Arrow.
Shareholders, however, might have different memories. In British Railways
1948-73, Professor Terry Gourvish, of the London School of Economics,
records that from 1935 to 1939 the GWR paid an average annual dividend of
2.8 per cent, the LMS 0.85 per cent, the SR 0.65 per cent, and the LNER
nothing. The truth is that any 'golden age', if ever such a thing existed,
had long since passed. Railways no longer enjoyed a monopoly over inland
transport: instead, their profits were being eroded by the rapid growth in
numbers of buses and lorries - and if that were not enough, by the Great
Depression.
Desperately short of cash and prevented by government edict from increasing
fares, the railways lacked the money to invest. Apart from the
electrification of the Southern Railway, improvements to services were
nugatory: railway historian Michael Bonavia records in The Four Great
Railways, for example, that it took almost until the eve of the Second World
War for train speeds to recover their 1914 levels.
Peter Butterfield of University College, Dublin, illustrates the realities
of that era when, in the Journal of Transport History (September 1986), he
writes of the LNER: 'Thanks to a handful of prestige trains - notably, the
high-speed streamliners introduced in 1935 and 1937 - the LNER had managed
to retain a good reputation among the travelling public at very small
capital cost, even though its services in areas like East Anglia were poor
and antiquated and its London services abysmal. 'What was lacking was any
long-term strategy. The management were primarily concerned with immediate
problems: the next bank holiday, the next summer season, efforts to get
replacements for the most hopelessly obsolete rolling stock, saving
candle-ends . . . '
It is an epitaph that could apply to any of the four companies. Their short,
unhappy history came to an end after just 25 years when, crippled by the
strains of the Second World War, they succumbed to nationalisation in 1948.
And yet, the memories linger on - of the days when the guard's van was piled
high with pigeon hampers and refrigerated Eldorado ice-cream containers;
when every horsehair-stuffed seat was topped with a freshly-laundered
antimacassar; when a five-course luncheon could be had in the dining car of
the Flying Scotsman for 3s 6d; and - most of all - when the trains always
ran on time.
Ah, shall we ever see their like again?

The European Court's ruling that Commission decisions should be signed in

alas defunct English legal defence that you cannot be successfully charged

to assume, though, that other EC cartel culprits will now get their fines
quashed. The court tends to back Brussels where it can, so will doubtless be
capable of finding another technicality to uphold the Commission's appeal.

It is perhaps just as well that Mr Donald Gordon, chairman of Capital &amp;
Counties, has been sounding off against open market property valuations for
so long. Complaining that the Pounds 325m valuation on the group's largest
asset, the Thurrock Lakeside shopping centre, is unfair serves at least as
some distraction from yesterday's news that Pounds 130m of shareholders
funds disappeared last year despite a Pounds 100m rights issue in August.
Some would say, though, that the Thurrock Lakeside valuation is generous
given that it implies an initial yield of 4.6 per cent, only reaching 8.3
per cent in 1996 when rents are fully in place.

FT  29 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Any Sids busy brushing up their maths as a prelude to making sense of
British Gas's annual results are wasting their time. The short-term outlook
for the shares will be shaped less by the confusing figures announced on
Thursday than by the forthcoming deal between Gas and the Office of Fair
Trading over the industrial market and the national gas pipeline. Judging by
the pointed silence since early February when the gas regulator issued a
grim warning about the huge remaining scope for monopoly abuse, Gas may yet
walk away with a deal which may make a nonsense of efforts to reduce its
powers. If it does, the blame will lie squarely with the OFT.
The central issue is whether a monopolist should be allowed to manage the
release of a share of its gas supplies to would-be competitors, while at the
same time seeking to keep its profits stable. The opportunity to replace a
monopoly with a cartel aside, logic suggests that if Gas has a halved share
of the industrial market, its profits should fall by the same proportion.
Otherwise, customers will face price rises of more than 50 per cent as new
suppliers demand the same level of return. Implications for industrial users
which presently rely on interruptible gas supplies are obvious.
Any benefit to Sid will probably prove transient, if only because it is hard
to imagine that the OFT would not have to rectify the position in time. The
shares could have an unexpected boost just the same.

FT  29 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyds/Macarthy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was eminently predictable that Lloyds Chemists would resume last year's
stymied attempt to take over Macarthy. After all, the referral to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission of its original paper bid was one of the
Trade Secretary's stranger decisions. If anything, though, the delay has
helped. Lloyds's higher share price means it can make its higher bid at the
cost of less cash. It has found an underwriter for a cash alternative, while
a problem over Macarthy's wholesale drug supplier conveniently dissolved.
More fundamentally, when it bid last August, Lloyds was fresh from the
acquisition of Kingswood and an accompanying Pounds 71m rights issue. The
referral gave it a chance to catch its breath before resuming its relentless
dash for growth.
The proposed shape of the combined group is clear enough. Lloyds will have
60 per cent gearing on net assets of perhaps Pounds 80m, so some smart work
will be required to generate cash and restore the balance sheet to health.
Shareholders have grown used by now to seeing the equity base expand, but
have been kept happy since 1986 by a compound annual growth rate in earnings
of 37 per cent. That may slow, but by normal measures Lloyds' shares are
cheap and the group should easily outperform other retailers for another
year or two. The trick for investors will be in timing a switch should
Lloyds' management show signs of wanting to diversify away from chemists
shops and health foods.

FT  29 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: The dilemma over dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,562.1 (+0.1)
With the FT-SE index despairingly stuck in a narrow 30 point trading range
this week, UK dividend policy predictably held centre stage. The early
evidence from companies, though, is far from conclusive. If anything, the
payouts announced thus far have been a mite more generous than the market
expected, the shock of Royal's decision to pass its final mitigated by
relief that the Vickers cut was less savage than it might have been, and
that Midland's final was held. The mood could change next week, however,
when at least 10 of the 17 major companies reporting their results may cut,
or at best maintain, their final payouts.
It is worth remembering, too, that while most of the attention is focused on
the cutters, there is also scope for disappointment from the more robust
companies, as Williams Holdings and to a lesser extent SmithKline proved
this week. Considerations for the strong are a lower market benchmark, lower
inflation, and the cost of replacing cash removed from the business at a
time when high real interest rates mean capital is expensive.
The question for investors is whether a prospective 5 per cent market yield
provides effective underpinning for equities at current levels. The main
worry, notably in the financials and capital goods sectors, is dividend
cover, which for the market as a whole may drop as low as 1.8 to 1.9 times,
against an average of roughly 2.5 times throughout the 1980s. To put this in
context, it will take at least three years of double digit earnings growth,
and no dividend increases, to restore cover to its former level. The more
positive view is that falling inflation puts equities on a prospective real
yield of 1-1.5 per cent this year - a phenomenon not seen since the
mid-1980s. The trouble is that this will only be reversed by improving
prospects for dividends, or a pick-up in inflation, neither of which looks
imminent.

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TROOPS OF the former Soviet Union were ordered to pull out from the Armenian
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday after they were fired on during
clashes between Azeri and Armenian militants.
Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the Commonwealth of Independent States'
defence minister, announced the decision as fighting worsened in the
disputed territory in spite of efforts to secure a truce.
The enclave is administered by Azerbaijan but largely populated by
Armenians.
The order for the pull-out of the 366th motorised regiment follows the
deaths earlier this week of a handful of soldiers caught in the fighting
between Armenian guerrillas and Azerbaijani forces.
Fighting flared again yesterday in the capital Stepanakert, where the
regiment is based. Azerbaijani and Armenian officials again claimed their
civilian targets were under particularly vicious attack.
Marshal Shaposhnikov, who is also commander-in-chief, has long warned that
he would withdraw troops rather than allow them to become targets of ethnic
conflicts in the former USSR. No dates have been given for the withdrawal.
Troops under fire along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border will also be
withdrawn. Commanders of the Trans-Caucasus military district, which
encompasses Georgia as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan, have been ordered to
rebuff attacks on military installations.
Mr Mikit Kazaryan, spokesman for the Armenian mission in Moscow, said
withdrawal from Nagorno-Karabakh would be 'madness' until the army
recaptured weapons seized from it by Azerbaijani forces. Azeri and Armenian
officials say sophisticated weapons, including combat helicopters, tanks and
armoured personnel carriers, are being used by guerrillas on both sides in
the four-year-old conflict.
Armenian militants attacked the last Azeri stronghold in Nagorno-Karabakh
yesterday, according to Azerbaijan's interior ministry. A ministry spokesman
said residents of the town of Shusha fled as helicopter gunships swooped
down from snow-covered mountains.
'They are still shelling with tanks and heavy artillery. But the helicopters
threw the town into panic,' he said by telephone from Baku, the Azerbaijani
capital. Armenians in the enclave want unification with Armenia, but
Azerbaijan will not give up any territory.

FT  29 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Dow waits for reality to catch up with
hopes - The prospects for US equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may seem an odd statement to make after a week when the Dow Jones
Industrial Average twice reached record highs, but the recent rally in US
stock markets appears to be running out of steam.
In the month from December 20, when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates
to their lowest levels for almost three decades, prompting a stampede into
equities by yield-hungry investors, the Dow Jones gained 11 per cent,
setting a number of new records.
Since mid-January, however, the Dow has gained less than 1 per cent,
oscillating uncomfortably in a 30-point trading range either side of 3,250.
It showed signs of breaking above this range in early trading yesterday,
following Wednesday's record high of 3,283.32.
An all-time high for the Dow can always be relied on to catch the headlines.
But the ability of blue-chip stocks to reach previously unscaled heights
should not distract investors from warning signs that the market rally -
which transformed 1991 from merely a good into an outstanding year for
investors - is looking vulnerable.
Mr Robert Doll, a senior investment manager at the New York-based fund group
Oppenheimer, provides one theory: 'The first, monetary phase of the bull
market, when it reacted to lower interest rates and ignored the real world,
is behind us. We are now in the second phase, when the market becomes
earnings-driven.'
In other words, investors are waiting for reality to catch up with
expectations. The surge in demand for equities late last year was fuelled by
two factors: lower interest rates, which made short-term financial assets
(such as bank certificates of deposit, money market funds and shorter-dated
treasury securities) less attractive to investors; and hopes for a recovery
in the economy and corporate profits by the summer.
Those factors are no longer in play. The fuel from the first - lower
interest rates - has probably run dry, although a distressing fall in
January consumer confidence earlier this week did briefly revive speculation
that the Fed would ease its monetary policy one more time. The consumer
confidence shock aside, the more measured opinion among observers is that
the authorities are satisfied with current policy, and that the chances of
another reduction in short-term interest rates are less than 50 per cent.
Regarding hopes of an imminent recovery in the economy, week ago when a
string of statistics suggested that economic activity had picked up at the
start of the year. Retail sales rose in January for the third month running,
early February car sales showed a bigger-than-expected increase and money
supply had grown at above-target rates since the new year.
The figures were immediately seized upon by the Bush administration as
evidence of a turnround in the country's economic fortunes. The stock
market, however, was less convinced, especially after Thursday's news of a
rise in weekly unemployment claims. It is clear that investors want proof,
and hard proof at that, of an economic recovery before taking another big
plunge into the market.
Waiting for that proof could test the market's patience severely. Mr David
Mullins, vice-chairman of the Fed, provided the best analysis of the current
state of the economy this week when he told a group of business economists
that while there were no signs of a further deterioration in the economy,
there was also 'no convincing evidence of any self-reinforcing process of
recovery'.
The economy is thus stuck in a half-way house: beyond the bottom of the
recession but not yet comfortably in the upswing. Until it moves on,
investors are unlikely to regain their appetite for stocks.
There are two possible saviours for the market's bulls: liquidity, and
politics.
The influence of liquidity on the market in the past few months cannot be
understated. Both institutional and especially individual investors bought
stocks in December and January because they had a lot of cash on their hands
and nowhere particularly attractive to put it after yields on short-term
assets had dropped to historically low levels.
There may also be plenty more cash left outside the market. According to
estimates compiled by the New York analytical firm Birinyi Associates, at
least Dollars 150bn of individual investors' assets remain in short-term
money market funds managed by securities houses. This is just the kind of
money that is likely to switch into equities if interest rates remain low
and, if just a fraction of that total went into the stock market, it would
have a big impact.
Finally, there is the political factor, which in this election year could be
a significant influence on market sentiment. Conventional wisdom is that the
market hates Democrats and likes Republicans.
The early signs of President Bush's electoral vulnerability in the New
Hampshire primary, when the television commentator Mr Patrick Buchanan
picked up almost 40 per cent of the Republican vote, actually gave a boost
to share prices.
The thinking among investors was crafty: the more vulnerable Mr Bush looks,
the more likely he is to pressure the Fed to lower interest rates and
increase his efforts to ensure that a tax-cutting package passes through
Congress. If either happened, the long-awaited recovery might be brought
that much closer.

FT  29 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Investors focus on food
and drug sectors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE NIKKEI gained marginally as investors focused on the pharmaceutical and
food sectors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average edged up 5.11 to 21,338.81, up 0.2 per cent on the week.
Volume fell to 180m shares from 220m as dealers retreated to the sidelines
ahead of the weekend.
Advances led declines by 467 to 466 with 185 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks rose 0.84 to 1,554.49 and in London
trading, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.17 to 1,185.90.
Hopes that a cut in the discount rate by the Bank of Japan would encourage
individuals to shift funds from bank deposits to equities helped market
sentiment.
Institutional investors were seen buying drug-related shares in small lots.
Mochida Pharmaceutical, the most active issue of the day, rose Y400 to
Y3,320. Companies involved in Aids research continued to gain, with Morinaga
Milk Products up Y15 to Y710.
Mr Kaoru Shimura, head of securities management at Sumitomo Life, said
institutions were likely to buy actively if the market showed signs of a
recovery. 'Profits on long-term holdings have already been locked in ahead
of the March book-closing, but we are looking to improve returns on
short-term holdings,' he said.
Some high-technology issues were slack on continued earnings concerns.
Hitachi fell Y10 to Y840 and Toshiba lost Y2 to Y610.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y16,000 to Y712,000 after the finance
ministry said that it was postponing a public sale of the remaining stock
scheduled for the current fiscal year. The issue had risen recently on hopes
of a stock split.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) announced that individual investors remained
net buyers of stock for the second consecutive week. In the week ending
February 21, individuals bought a net Y70.2bn, while institutional investors
remained net sellers for the fourth consecutive week.
The TSE also said that the average daily share volume on the first section
fell to 196m shares in February, the lowest since June 1982, when the daily
average fell to 172m shares.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 14.02 to 22,955.57 in volume of 48.2m shares.
Roundup
THE Pacific Rim was mixed ahead of the weekend, though Hong Kong recorded
its third consecutive record high.
HONG KONG shed early gains on profit-taking and the Hang Seng Index closed
up 33.93 at 4,929.06, a 4 per cent rise on the week. Turnover was HKDollars
4.06bn against HKDollars 3.77bn. In the property sector Cheung Kong rose 30
cents to HKDollars 21.90, while Hongkong Telecom gained 20 cents to
HKDollars 8.40.
KUALA LUMPUR consolidated its recent rise. The composite index rose 4.40 to
605.06, but down 1.7 per cent on the week. Carlsberg put on 30 cents to
MDollars 12.10 after announcing good 1991 results.
SINGAPORE remained cautious ahead of the budget. The Straits Times
Industrial Index closed up 5.52 at 1,477.43 in turnover of SDollars 48m, but
down 2.7 per cent over the week.
SEOUL fell on local reports that the government was making large companies
produce consolidated financial statements. The composite index lost 9.37 to
614.99, down 2.8 per cent on the week, in turnover of Won303.8bn after
Won262.9bn.
TAIWAN rose as investors regained some confidence: the weighted index closed
up 12.47 at 5,031.69, a 1.6 per cent rise on the week. Turnover fell to
TDollars 27.8bn from TDollars 37.5bn.
MANILA was unmoved by good 1991 results from San Miguel and the composite
index fell 17.44 to 1,183.67, but still 2.2 per cent ahead on the week.
Turnover was 140.2m pesos against 174.1m pesos.
AUSTRALIA was pushed lower by industrial stocks. The All Ordinaries Index
fell 9.0 to 1,614.2, 0.4 per cent down on the week. Turnover was ADollars
381.9m. Brambles Industries fell to a 10 month low, closing down 60 cents at
ADollars 16.20, after reporting a 13 per cent decline half-year net profits.
NEW ZEALAND closed weaker, the NZSE-40 down 1.91 at 1,493.21, down 0.4 per
cent on the week. Fletcher Challenge fell 5 cents to NZDollars 3.33.

FT  29 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses ease in
pre-weekend trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR BOURSES traded quietly ahead of the weekend, while Brussels and
Zurich closed at their year's highs, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT eased back after a firm performance this week. Dealers reported
position unwinding ahead of the weekend and Dusseldorf's closure on Monday
for Carnival. The FAZ index, calculated at midsession, showed a small rise
of 0.99 to 709.75 for a gain of 1.9 per cent on the week, while the DAX
index fell 4.77 to 1,745.13, up 1.6 per cent on the week. Turnover fell to
DM6.0bn from DM8.5bn.
Analysts said that under-lying sentiment remained positive. Mr Gary Dugan,
European strategist at Baring Securities, said a visit to the Bundesbank
this week reinforced his favourable stance towards interest rate-sensitive
stocks, such as banks and insurers. He said that German inflation was likely
to peak at 4.6 per cent in March, below previous estimates of 5 per cent,
and fall further by mid-year. Money supply, which grew at an annualised rate
of 9 per cent in January, should also be back within the Bundesbank's 5 1/2
per cent target by mid-year. These factors increased the possibility of an
interest rate cut in the second half, Mr Dugan said.
Klockner-Werke weighed on the steel sector, falling as low as DM116.50 on
Thursday's news that it would pass the dividend on 1990/91 results. Analysts
were surprised that the stock fell so much because the decision had not been
unexpected. The stock closed DM5.90 lower at DM118.90. Thyssen lost DM1.60
to DM232.90 and Preussag slipped DM2.30 to DM384.70.
The car sector gave back some of the week's gains, with Daimler-Benz down
DM4.30 at DM757.50 and BMW DM4 off at DM562.50.
PARIS ended slightly lower as the expiry of monthly options contracts
brought the market off the day's highs. The CAC-40 index went as high as
1,995.59 before closing down 1.74 at 1,983.38, up 1.1 per cent on the week,
in pre-weekend turnover of FFr2.8bn.
Blue chips were mixed. Michelin added another 60 centimes to FFr172 on
volume of 328,150 shares after touching a new 1992 intraday high of FFr173.
Elf rose FFr1.50 to FFr390 with 297,900 shares traded but Total fell for the
second day running, closing FFr5 down at FFr243.
MILAN ended lower on a lack of interest before the weekend. The Comit index
fell 4.47 to 536.03, hardly changed on the week, in turnover estimated near
to Thursday's L95.8bn.
The insurance and banking sectors continued to be weak. Banco di Roma fell
3.5 per cent or L90 to L2,335, while Banco di Santo Spirito dropped 3.4 per
cent or L90 to L2,550 following Wednesday's news of a one-for-one share
exchange. Generali dropped L525 to L30,950 and Ras fell L124 to L22,471. But
Sai rose L535 to L15,700.
AMSTERDAM was generally quiet and the CBS Tendency Index closed unchanged at
126.6, a 0.4 per cent rise on the week. Nedlloyd, the transport group, rose
Fl 2.4 or 3.8 per cent to Fl 64.20 after news that European shipping lines
were to co-operate in an effort to improve freight rates on Far East lines.
Philips remained strong following Thursday's results and closed up Fl 0.80
at Fl 36.40, although down from the day's high of Fl 36.80. KLM showed a
slight improvement after Thursday's announcement that merger talks with
British Airways had failed: it was up Fl 0.40 or 1 per cent to Fl 38.60.
Fokker's results, which showed a 4.3 per cent rise in 1991 net profits, and
the announcement that it would pay a dividend for the first time since 1986,
came after the market had closed. It finished down Fl 0.10 at Fl 31.70.
ZURICH, led higher by UBS reporting a 36 per cent rise in 1991 profits,
recorded a year's high. The SPI Index closed up 6.0 at 1,149.6, a rise of
1.4 per cent over the week. UBS bearers gained SFr80 to SFr3,930. Nestle
bearers lost SFr20 to SFr9,490 on profit-taking.
BRUSSELS followed early gains in Paris and Amsterdam. The Bel-20 index
closed at the year's high, up 4.63 at 1,210.55, a rise of 2.3 per cent on
the week. Turnover was BFr1.15bn. Petrofina gained BFr75 to BFr10,625.
OSLO ended weaker with interest focused on Den Norske Bank after its shares
were briefly suspended on concerns over its capital adequacy. The All-Share
Index closed down 1.97 at 412.31 in turnover of NKr133m, a fall of 0.5 per
cent on the week. DnB finished down NKr0.6 at NKr6.4, having traded at
NKr5.30 prior to its suspension. The bank had reported earlier this month
that 1991 net losses had risen threefold to NKr4.32bn after credit losses
had swelled to NKr5.58bn.
STOCKHOLM took some optimism from expectations that the central bank may
soon cut interest rates. The Affarsvarlden General Index closed up 5.0 at
940.4, a gain of 0.9 per cent on the week. Turnover was SKr445m against
SKr502m.
MADRID also rose on hopes of further interest rate cuts, and a stronger
opening on Wall Street. The general index closed up 1.83 at 266.51, a rise
of 2.9 per cent on the week. Turnover was estimated at some Pta20bn.
ISTANBUL fell as the rising dollar prompted selling by investors wanting to
switch into the currency market. The 75-share market index closed at
3,664.36, down 91.61 on the day and 8.06 per cent lower on the week.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean labour row boosts
copper - Week in the Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COPPER market provided the main bright spot at the London Metal Exchange
this week, with prices climbing to 2 1/2 -month highs.
The rise, which left the cash quotation Pounds 34.25 up at Pounds 1,295.50 a
tonne, got under way on Monday following news of labour problems at the
world's biggest underground copper mine, the Chilean Copper Corporation's
(Codelco's) El Teniente. Output was affected that day as 2,000 of the 9,000
workers downed tools in protest at the sacking last weekend of 150 miners.
There have been no stoppages since then and talks have been held between
management and union leaders. Codelco said these had reached 'positive
agreements', but hardline unions said they had not called off the protest
plan. The possibility of further disruption helped to keep the upward
pressure on copper prices at the LME, although that was partly
counterbalanced towards the end of the week by talk that Russia had reduced
duties on metal exports. London traders said yesterday they had no precise
clarification on this but said it appeared that some revisions had been
made, notably for crude nickel exports. No reductions had been announced for
refined nickel or copper, the traders said, but they thought refined
aluminium from the Krasnoyarsk and Bratsk smelters might have been exempted
from export duty.
Both nickel and aluminium prices fell quite sharply in response. Cash nickel
closed at Dollars 7,665 a tonne, down Dollars 250 on the day and Dollars 305
on the week. Cash aluminium was down Dollars 20 on the day at Dollars
1,298.50 a tonne, but that was still Dollars 3.50 up on the week.
Sentiment in the aluminium market had earlier benefitted from copper's
strength as a continuation of the recent rise lifted the cash price to a
seven-month high of Dollars 1,322.50 on Wednesday. The announcement on
Tuesday of a 20,450-tonne rise in LME warehouse stocks was shrugged off in
the market, but in yesterday's bearish mood a further rise of 7,975 tonnes -
to a record 1,115,050 tonnes - added to the downward pressure, though it was
in line with expectations.
Zinc prices recovered some of their recent losses this week after force
majeure was declared on shipments from Peru's biggest zinc refinery,
Cajamarquilla. Minero Peru, the state company that owns the refinery, said
output was being cut by power rationing. Last year Cajamarquilla produced
93,000 tonnes of zinc.
A further rise was encouraged on Wednesday by talk that Cominco of Canada
planned to cut production at its Trail smelter, where it produces 270,000
tonnes of zinc and 110,000 tonnes of lead annually. The company later denied
the rumours, but that did not halt the price rise. On Thursday Pasminco of
Australian announced that it planned to dispose of its European assets,
highlighting concern about the future of the 210,000 tonnes-a-year Budelco
smelter on the Belgian-Dutch border, which it owns jointly with Billiton,
the mining and metals arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. This helped to
fuel the price rise and cash metal closed yesterday at Dollars 1,185.50 a
tonne, up Dollars 21.50 on the day and Dollars 77 on the week.
A lethargic precious metals market was enlivened in mid-week by confusion
about a development in the manufacture of exhaust-cleaning autocatalysts,
the biggest single user of platinum. Corning, the US group, said it had
developed a catalyst, using extruded powdered ceramics, that could meet the
tough 1997 emission standards set by the Californian government.
Panic selling pushed the platinum price down by nearly Dollars 4 a troy
ounce before Corning made it clear that its invention would be used in
addition to, not instead of, platinum. The market quickly regained its
losses and finished ahead on the day.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange there was no let-up in the misery
of the robusta coffee market. With supplies continuing abundant and demand
slack the May delivery price sank to a 17-year low of Dollars 787 a tonne at
one stage, before ending the week Dollars 21 down on balance at Dollars 818
a tonne. According to a report published this week by ED &amp; F. Man, the
London trade house, coffee prices are likely to fall further before moving
higher in a few months time.
'In all sectors (of the coffee market) the sentiment seems to be that while
prices may recover during the course of the year, it is too dangerous to act
now on the assumption that there will be no short-run downward moves,' it
warned.

FT  29 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEELING of inertia descended on dealings in stock index futures with
little in the way of economic data on which to focus, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened slightly lower than anticipated at 2,569, March initially
slipped back in light selling before buying from independent traders led to
a recovery, the contract going forward to 2,573 by lunchtime.
Improved buying was noted with Wall Street's firm opening, but talk of an
opinion poll to be published this weekend showing a strong lead for the
Labour Party was said to have halted any further advance.
Dealers noted an improved premium of about 3 points in the June contract.
March closed at 2,576, around 7 points above estimated fair value premium of
about 6. Turnover was 3,983 lots.
In traded options, turnover at 25,521 was surprisingly low for an expiry
day. The FT-SE 100 index option was busy at 8,385 contracts.
British Steel was the busiest stock option. It traded 1,727 contracts with
the April 60 calls, together with the April 80 calls, equally active. This
was followed by British Gas which traded 1,415 lots. Amstrad, Midland Bank
and British Aerospace were also active.

FT  29 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Property results blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST property company report of the season left little doubt that the
sector is facing some grim news in the near future. Capital &amp; Counties
revealed a halving of profits to Pounds 27m and a 29 per cent fall in net
asset values at 283p. The shares tumbled on the results, down 14 to 166p, on
a stock 73 per cent owned by Transatlantic Corporation of South Africa.
Capital specialises in out-of-town shopping units and has been particularly
badly hit by the downturn in the retail sector. 'With consumer spending
unlikely to pick up for some time, some retailers will still have to be
offered rent-free units until 1993 at the earliest,' said Mr Ray Jones at
Paribas. He added that the company faced a further fall in profits this
year. Other analysts agreed, with Mr Chris Turner at BZW looking for Pounds
18m profits this year, and Mr Michael Padley at Strauss Turnbull on Pounds
23m.
The results come after a bad week for the sector, with three houses - UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew, County NatWest and Panmure Gordon - issuing negative
reports and selective company downgrades. Falling office rental values,
particularly in central London, remain the chief cause for concern.
However, for some property issues, the bottom may have been reached,
according to UBS which is turning buyer on stocks it was recommending a hold
or sell at the beginning of the week; namely MEPC, Slough Estates and
Hammerson. MEPC tumbled yesterday on a negative trade press report, down 5
at 338p, while Hammerson Ordinary slipped 2 to 467p and Slough was steady at
201p. Great Portland pleased the market with its sale of its stake in Bride
Hall, another property group, the shares rising 6 to 160p.
Wellcome ahead
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome jumped before an announcement by the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) that it had approved the Zovirax herpes drug
for treatment of chicken pox in children.
The shares were marked up sharply at the start of trading with some dealers
offering stock at as much as 1,150p. The shares continued firm following
confirmation of the FDA approval by the company. However, analysts pointed
out that the news had already been included in most profit forecasts and the
enthusiasm dwindled. Wellcome closed 11 up at 1,126p with 1.7m shares
traded.
ICI bounce
Chemicals giant ICI bounced back by 9 to 1,293p as a number of securities
houses reiterated their buy recommendations on the stock in the wake of its
full-year results on Thursday.
Both County NatWest and Hoare Govett were pointing out the company's strong
points to clients, although County's 1992 profit forecast for ICI of Pounds
950m is at the lower end of the analysts' forecasts. Hoare Govett predicts
Pounds 1.04bn. A news report that its breast cancer drug might cause liver
cell damage came too late to affect the shares.
BP uncertain
Shares in BP eased 1 to 266p, on turnover of 15m but managed to shrug off
news that Moody's, the US credit rating agency, may downgrade Dollars 6.2bn
of outstanding long-term debt. Short-term debt of BP's guaranteed
subsidiaries is not under review. The shares were helped by a long-term buy
note from Merrill Lynch.
Moody's view appears more in line with recent warnings from London sources
than with the more optimistic opinions of Wall Street analysts: Goldman
Sachs and Salomon Brothers have also recommended the shares this week. The
debt rating agency yesterday cited concern that BP's earnings will remain
under pressure, which could stress its operating cash flow and result in
increased borrowings to support exploration and development expenditures.
Still suffering from its poorly-received results, Royal Insurance Holdings
continued its downward spiral, the shares losing a further 7 to 183p, on top
of Thursday's fall of 36. Sun Alliance also slipped 7 to 264p, but General
Accident regained some of its previous day's losses, rising 6 to 432p.
Bear raiders were once again in evidence at P&amp;O. The shares tumbled 20 to
366 as market hints resurfaced of problems at Chelsfield, the private
company with which P&amp;O runs the Pall Mall Properties group.
Profit-taking combined with negative sentiment left Tiphook 18 down at 378p.
British Airways gained five to 270p as Lehman Brothers recommended the stock
to both US and UK clients. Turnover at 8.2m included a block of 2.5m done at
267 1/2 and another at 265 1/2 . Among aerospace and engineering stocks,
British Aerospace took centre stage. The shares jumped 9 to 317p boosted by
speculation that the company would soon come into the lucrative Al Yamamah 2
Saudi Arabia defence contract. Turnover reached 5.2m.
Analysts upgrades on Midland Bank, following its well-received figures on
Thursday, helped the shares add 7 to 267p in busy turnover of 8m. Lloyds
Bank basked in favourable comments from most corners of the market, gaining
8 to 413p. A feeling that National Westminster Bank had put the worst behind
it helped it add 3 to 311p. More cautious notes on Barclays, however -
Credit Lyonnais Laing, for example, recommending a switch into NatWest - saw
the shares slip 7 to 368p.
Ranks Hovis lost 5 to 202p after Mr Tim Potter at Smith New Court cut his
1992 profit forecast to Pounds 105m from Pounds 115m, following a
presentation by the company. Worries about the UK bread industry were behind
the downgrading.
Associated British Foods fell 2 to 430p and Hillsdown Holdings gave up 1 to
152p on the referral of Hillsdown's planned acquisition of AB Food's canning
and ambient stored meals division to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Disappointment at Unilever's results have hit the shares this week, but the
price rebounded 7 to 941p, helped by a recommendation from Smith New Court.
A profit downgrading by Kleinwort Benson left food retailer Kwik Save 12
lower at 566p on turnover of 3m shares.
Two trades totalling 5m shares provided most of Whitbread 'A' turnover of
6m. The shares fell 5 to 460p, with Allied-Lyons also losing 5 to 642p.
USM-quoted property company Union Square was the heaviest traded stock with
a recorded turnover of 26m shares. Smith New Court had carried out an agency
cross in 6.6 per cent of the company's shares. The shares closed a halfpenny
better at 4 1/2 p and the company said it would be making an announcement on
Monday.
Lloyds Chemists lost 12 to 327p after announcing that it will make a
recommended offer for chemist Macarthy, valued at Pounds 93.6m, or 337p per
share. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission on Wednesday gave approval for
Lloyds to proceed with an earlier Pounds 79m bid, as well as allowing rival
UniChem to make an offer. Macarthy, which had risen sharply the previous
day, partly on hopes that the Lloyds bid might be worth around 360p, eased 2
to 327p. Unichem gained 2 to 204p.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Appointments: US forests branch out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fountain Forestry, a private company managing some 350,000 acres of trees in
the UK and the US for institutions and wealthy individuals, has made its US
president Bruce Jacobs a director of Fountain Forestry Incorporated, a
division of the group.
Based near Concord, New Hampshire, the 42-year-old American is managing
primarily hardwood forests along the length of the Appalachians, from
Vermont southwards.
With a degree in forestry and a period of research during which he developed
a speciality in hardwoods, Jacobs came to Fountain from International Paper
in 1984 and has been president of the US operations for a year.
As well as looking after some 150,000 acres of land, Jacobs will be
recruiting new investors. A handful of US institutions put forests in their
portfolios, but he will mostly be flying to seminars in the UK and Europe,
selling chunks of US forest that are much cheaper than the UK equivalent
because of prime growing conditions.
Fountain, with others, attained a degree of notoriety in the early 1980s for
its afforestation of a remote corner of Scotland when the 'green
money-machine', operating for wealthy famous names ranging from media to
snooker stars, caused an environmental furore.
Since then there has been 'steady progress in reconciling commercial with
environmental objectives,' says Barry Gamble, managing director of the
group. 'Indeed, our management practices are now championed by conservation
groups in the US.'
Fountain is a management buyout company, in which Charterhouse Development
Capital has a 20 per cent stake. Jacobs is not a shareholder; there are
complications in giving share options to a US-based director.

FT  29 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Calm session as results flow slackens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK market traders rested on their oars yesterday as the pace of company
reporting slowed down at the end of a week which has been dominated by
trading statements from the heavyweights of British finance and industry.
With the latest UK opinion polls expected to report at the weekend,
investors continued to focus on the re-election prospects of Mr John Major's
Conservative government, which are believed to be closely linked to the
contents of the budget speech to be delivered a week on Tuesday.
Government bonds eased by  3/8 or so in continued reaction to the poor UK
trade figures disclosed on Thursday.
Share prices fluctuated even more narrowly than earlier this week before
closing with little change. The final reading of 2,562.1 showed the FT-SE
Index a mere 0.1 up.
Earlier, the Index was down 10.4 when market attendance was hindered by
commuter travel problems prompted by a security alert throughout central
London following a bomb explosion at a main-line railway station.
Also holding stocks back was a narrowing in the premium on the FT-SE March
futures contract, which has often provided a lead for the market over the
past week.
Share prices soon rallied in the absence of significant selling and although
London paid little heed to an early gain of 10 Dow points when Wall Street
opened for the new session, the final picture was stable.
Trading volume, as measured through the Seaq network, which takes in both
retail and intra-market business, dwindled somewhat as the corporate
reporting load lightened; yesterday's 449.7m shares compared with 606.2m on
Thursday when Midland Bank, ICI and British Gas all reported profits.
Retail, or customer-originated, business in equities totalled Pounds 1.2bn
on Thursday, among the highest daily totals for the year so far.
The banking sector, which generally satisfied the market this week with its
dividend and profits announcements, improved yesterday. The exception,
however, was Barclays whose trading statement had disclosed payment from
reserves to help meet the cost of the dividend.
Last night's closing levels left the FT-SE Index with a gain of 19.8 over
the first week of the two week equity trading account. The gain has
reflected optimism for a relatively generous budget, hopefully accompanied
closely by the widely-expected reduction in UK base rates.
However, the market still has to face trading statements from across the
range of British industry.
Retail volume in equities has remained volatile but has increased as the
market has responded favourably to the flow of company results.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Money Markets: UK rates edge up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of a base rate cut were put aside yesterday and rates firmed in the
face of a big shortage of credit on the final trading day of the month.
The Bank of England's opening forecast of Pounds 1.7bn was slightly lower
than market expectations which had ranged as high as Pounds 2bn. The
shortfall was due mainly to more than Pounds 2bn of treasury bills and
maturing assistance.
But the day proved as difficult as expected, largely because only half the
bills due were reckoned to have been renewed. This may have been because
corporates did not need the funds, or because they saw a chance of cheaper
money in the near future.
The effect was that much of the shortage failed to be transferred to the
most accessible places.
In the early round the Bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 590m for resale
to the market at 10 7/16 per cent on March 20. At midday, it purchased
outright Pounds 36m of band 1 treasury bills at 10 3/8 per cent and Pounds
37m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, together with a further Pounds
41m of bills for resale.
The shortfall forecast was raised to Pounds 1.95bn in the afternoon,
however, and the Bank purchased Pounds 736m of band 1 treasury bills and
band 1 and 2 bank bills outright at 10 3/8 per cent, plus Pounds 69m for
resale.
This still left the system Pounds 441m short, for which late assistance
accounted for only Pounds 220m.
Overnight rates went as high as 16 per cent in the afternoon, having earlier
hovered at 11 3/4 -11 1/2 per cent, closing at 13-12 1/2 per cent.
Short rates remained firm, with the one-week rate up to 10 7/8 -10 5/8 ,
very expensive compared with a 10 1/2 per cent base rate. The key
three-month interbank rate was unchanged at 10 3/8 -10 1/4 per cent.
The March short sterling contract dropped as far as 89.76 from a 89.86
start, before coming back slightly to 89.80.
German call money rates were also firmer as liquidity levels fell sharply.
Overnight rates were quoted at 9.55/65 per cent, up from 9.45/55 per cent on
Thursday, but below the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate.
Bundesbank reserves plunged to DM60.0bn on Wednesday from DM75.3bn on
Tuesday, due to the outflow of pension payments. Traders said uncertainty
about when funds would flow back into the system, and when it would be hit
by February employee wage payments, had pushed overnight rates up.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar in volatile trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR settled in the day's mid-range yesterday after a volatile but
ultimately indecisive session.
The markets were presented with mixed US economic indicators. Higher
inventories pushed the fourth quarter US gross domestic product growth up to
a revised 0.8 per cent from 0.3 per cent. But the Chicago Purchasing
Management index showed a seasonally adjusted fall to 48.0 per cent, from
49.2, its lowest since last June.
Mr Michael Feeny, a senior dealer at Sumitomo Bank, said: 'There has been
underlying strength in the dollar during the week, but sentiment has
weakened.' Traders said the dollar was boxed in between well-defended
support and resistance levels at DM1.63 and DM1.66 respectively.
The dollar closed at DM1.6375, against DM1.6440 on Thursday. It had started
the day by testing support at DM1.6300 but recovered to a DM1.6450 high by
mid-session after Mr Hiroshi Yasuda, Japanese deputy finance minister, said
the G7 may not intervene in the market as long as currency movements were
not drastic.
Traders said his comments had come at a particularly sensitive time as the
G7 deputy finance ministers were meeting yesterday and today and currency
policy was believed to be on the agenda.
Intervention by the Bank of Japan alone has tended to be unsuccessful, but
after US treasury undersecretary Mr David Mulford said on Thursday he was
not worried about the level of the dollar, it appeared unlikely the Japanese
would win the assistance of the US in coordinated action.
The dollar still dropped back slightly against the yen, to 129.00/10, from a
start of 129.25/35. In Tokyo, it had closed at 129.33 after quiet trading.
The D-Mark rose slightly against the EMS currencies, after the decline in
the dollar, and held its gains on the Swiss franc despite moves by the Swiss
National Bank to shore up short-term money rates.
It also gained against sterling, largely due to the continued decline of the
peseta. The Spanish currency, stuck at its limits earlier this week, eased
amid talk that more Spanish rate cuts are on the way and that it may soon
enter the ERM's 2.25 per cent band.
The peseta was at 5.77 per cent above its pivot against sterling, down from
5.95 per cent on Thursday, lowering the effective floor for sterling within
the system.
Sterling remained slightly above the floor, prompting some dealers to
suggest that an imminent UK base rate may not yet be out of the question.
It closed at DM2.8778 after a 2.8816 start and 2.8867 close on Wednesday. It
ended little changed against the dollar at Dollars 1.7580, compared with
Dollars 1.7575 on Thursday.

FT  29 FEB 92 / International Company News: TWA reaches agreement with PBGC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANS World Airlines, the bankrupt carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn, has
reached agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the US
federal agency which guarantees the payment of basic pensions, over the
proposed sale of TWA's Travel Channel subsidiary, writes Nikki Tait.
The PBGC had argued the subsidiary was 'jointly and severally' liable for
TWA's pension underfunding, which it puts at Dollars 933m. It claimed the
money should be set aside to meet the pension deficit and should not be
swallowed up by TWA's operating losses.
Under the deal, the PBGC's position is essentially satisfied. Travel Channel
is prohibited from dividending or giving the sale proceeds to TWA and if TWA
seeks to borrow the cash, Travel Channel will have a fully-secured position
and 'a super priority claim' on behalf of its creditors.
Monies involved in the Travel Channel sale are relatively small - although
they are material in the context of TWA's distressed financial condition.
According to documents filed in the bankruptcy court, TWA had an operating
loss of Dollars 37.1m in January and an after-tax loss of Dollars 51.6m. TWA
filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on January 31.
The PBGC is pursuing claims at Continental Airlines, which has been in
bankruptcy since late-1990. The bankrupt airline is seeking to sell Air
Micronesia - in which Continental holds a controlling stake - for Dollars
290m.
But the PBGC argues that the proceeds should be applied to the underfunded
pension plans at Eastern Airlines, now defunct but once the sister carrier
to Continental.

reports

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S finance ministry yesterday moved quickly to counter reports it is
considering erasing the shares of Den norske Bank (DnB), Norway's biggest
bank, and putting it under full state control.
Trading in DnB's shares, bonds and options were suspended on the Oslo bourse
for several hours yesterday after plunging by NKr1.70 to NKr5.30 on concerns
over its capital adequacy. A local news agency had quoted Mr Svein
Aasmundstad, the controversial head of the Banking, Insurance and Securities
Commission (BISC), as saying the government was about to consider writing
down the value of DnB's shares to zero.
In October, Christiania Bank, the second biggest bank, declared its equity
had been wiped out and was delisted from the bourse and taken over by the
state.
Christiania is due to report 1991 figures on March 5, but local media has
speculated that the bank will report net losses of NKr10bn (Dollars 1.56bn).
Last December, Fokus Bank, the third biggest bank, was taken over by the
state and nearly doubled 1991 net losses to NKr2.1bn.
Earlier this month DnB reported 1991 net losses nearly trebled to NKr4.32bn
after credit losses of NKr5.58bn.
However, in December Norwegian finance officials orchestrated a complex
rescue action for DnB, to keep it from falling into the hands of the state
in a deal in which the bank was forced to write down the face value of its
shares to NKr10 from NKr100.
The finance ministry yesterday issued a statement confirming DnB's equity
amounted to 7.7 per cent of risk-weighted balance sheet items following the
state rescue, compared with a legal minimum of 5.6 per cent.
For its part, DnB has no plans to seek extra state funding or change plans
to expand its capital later this year. DnB's A-shares closed NKr0.60 down at
NKr6.40 yesterday.

<TEXT>
THE European Commission has launched a preliminary investigation into
Nestle's FFr13.42bn (Dollars 2.39bn) bid for Perrier, its second probe into
the network of bids and counter-bids involving the French mineral water
group.
On Monday, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner, will decide
whether the Agnelli family's FFr5.6bn agreed bid for Exor, Perrier's
controlling shareholder, raises 'serious doubts' about its effects on
competition in the EC. If it does, the Commission will launch a full
four-month inquiry into the offer, which would freeze the bid.
Both the Agnelli/Exor deal and the proposed Nestle/Perrier merger crossed
the turnover threshold which triggers an automatic investigation. The
process could also be set in motion by the counter-bid for Exor by BSN, the
French food group, and by this week's full bid for Perrier by Exor.

FT  29 FEB 92 / International Company News: Saab-Scania profits tumble to
SKr1.69bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAAB-SCANIA, the Swedish vehicle and aerospace group, suffered a 22 per cent
fall in profits (after financial items) to SKr1.69bn (Dollars 286m) last
year. This compares with profits of SKr2.2bn in 1990.
The group said yesterday it lost SKr1.12bn from its half share in Saab Auto
which it owns jointly with General Motors of the US.
But Mr Lars Kylberg, president and chief executive officer, said the group's
operating units had performed well last year, despite the continuing
recession. Consolidated operating income after depreciation amounted to
SKr1.8bn, only 12 per cent less than in 1990, while consolidated sales rose
slightly to SKr29.3bn from SKr29.0bn.
In his forecast for 1992 Mr Kylberg said he hoped the company would achieve
a better result. 'Despite lower income due to tougher price competition, an
increased proportion of deliveries to lower margin markets outside Europe
and considerably lower income in South America, Scania's profit of SKr2.2bn
stands up well in comparison with other producers,' he said.
There was also an improvement in Saab Aircraft's profit (after financial
items) to SKr200m, from SKr111m in the previous year. It has started a
SKr153m rationalisation programme to reduce costs and it is to be divided
into two parts: one, military aircraft, the other, commercial with the aim
of achieving greater efficiency and market impact.
Investor, Sweden's largest investment company which owns 100 per cent of
Saab-Scania, yesterday reported profits (after financial items) of
SKr1.02bn.
Investor was formed by the merger last November of Investor and Providentia,
the two investment companies that formed the core of the Wallenberg family
industrial empire.
With total assets of SKr79.42bn and a share portfolio valued at SKr21.33bn,
it proposed a 22 per cent increase in its dividend to SKr5.25 a share.

FT  29 FEB 92 / International Company News: Fokker to pay first dividend in
five years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft builder, is to resume paying a dividend for the
first time in five years.
The company said yesterday that the long-awaited move reflected progress
made during 1991 - despite the subdued world aviation market - and the
favourable outlook for the longer term.
Fokker also reported that it had posted net profit of Fl 87m (Dollars 47m)
in 1991, compared with Fl 83m the previous year.
Operating profit increased at a more buoyant rate of 55 per cent to Fl 145m,
but growth in net results was held back by a sharp rise in interest charges
and by a markedly lower contribution to profits from associate companies.
Turnover was up by 19 per cent at Fl 3.8bn.
'Barring unforeseen circumstances, a further improvement of the company's
results is expected in 1992,' Fokker said.
The cash payout to shareholders from 1991 earnings has been fixed at Fl 0.75
per share.
Fokker last paid a dividend out of 1986 results, when shareholders either
received Fl 1.75 in cash or exercised an option to receive the payout in a
mixture of cash and shares.
Dividend payments were halted in 1987 after the Dutch government came to
Fokker's rescue when it ran into difficulties arranging the simultaneous
launch of two new aircraft, the Fokker 50 and 100. The government now holds
32 per cent of Fokker's shares.
The company had originally hoped to pay a dividend on 1990 results but it
postponed resumption of a payout because of the Gulf war and also the
weakness of the dollar.

<TEXT>
ESAB, the world's leading welding equipment producer, has reported a 97 per
cent fall in profits after financial items to SKr9m (Dollars 1.5m) in 1991
and has halved its dividend to SKr3.25.
The sharp earnings fall was blamed on a 7 per cent decline in sales to
SKr6.57bn as well as costs associated with a reduction of the workforce.
Although Esab predicts profitability will improve in 1992 due to
cost-cutting measures, it expects market growth to be slow and only a
marginal increase in sales.
Orders during 1991 fell 9 per cent to SKr6.37bn, reflecting a decline in
industrial production and reduced investments by customers.
Esab noted that demand weakened in all its leading markets, which included
Europe, the US, Brazil and south-east Asia.

FT  29 FEB 92 / International Company News: JAL sees Y8bn loss as sales
decline

<TEXT>
JAPAN Airlines (JAL), Japan's leading international carrier, said yesterday
it expected to post a pre-tax loss of Y8bn (Dollars 61.7m) in the year to
end-March owing to a fall in business travel.
The forecast compares with pre-tax profits of Y24.8bn last year, and a
forecast issued in October of Y14bn.
JAL, in common with most international carriers, has had difficulties
keeping its flights full, but has been unable to cut significantly its high,
fixed running costs. A revival in international travel following the Gulf
war has not materialised on the scale expected, and the company said a
cost-cutting programme would not be enough to offset the decline in sales.
JAL said that as a result of the global recession, international passenger
revenue is expected to drop by 4.6 per cent from last year's total of
Y573.2bn. Total sales for the company are expected to decline from
Y1,118.9bn to Y1,112bn.
International cargo traffic has also dropped as a result of slow business
conditions, with sales expected to decline by Y11.2bn, or 7.2 per cent.
After-tax profits are expected to fall from Y13.71bn a year ago to a loss of
Y4bn. A 5 yen per share dividend will none the less be declared.

FT  29 FEB 92 / International Company News: Buoyant UBS unveils capital
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNION Bank of Switzerland (UBS) has reported consolidated net income of
SFr1.2bn (Dollars 857.1m) for 1991, a 35.6 per cent gain on the depressed
result of the previous year.
The bank, Switzerland's largest and strongest, also unveiled a capital
restructuring, consisting of splits of its registered and bearer shares and
a forced conversion of its participation certificates into bearer shares.
Shareholders are being offered unchanged dividends plus bonus warrants on
terms to be set later.
Mr Robert Studer, president of the executive board, said the 'very
satisfactory' results were attributable mainly to the improvement in UBS
operations outside Switzerland. These contribute about a quarter of the
group's profits.
Net interest income jumped 23.3 per cent to SFr3.3bn, thanks largely to the
sharp decline in dollar interest rates, while profit from trading in
securities and foreign exchange markets soared 44.3 per cent to SFr1.3bn.
Net income from fund management and other services rose 19.6 per cent to
SFr2.7bn.
Cash flow reached SFr3.4bn compared with SFr2.5bn. Depreciation and
provisions were up 29.6 per cent to SFr1.7bn. Consolidated total assets
stood at SFr249.3bn at the end of 1991, only 6.5 per cent higher than a year
earlier, and 2 per cent came from the appreciation of most currencies
against the Swiss franc.
Capital and reserves, including the 1991 net profit, rose 3.8 per cent to
SFr18.4bn at the year end. Mr Studer emphasised the strength of UBS's
balance sheet, perhaps seeking to ease fears it too might face scrutiny from
a credit rating agency. Last month, Moody's removed its triple A rating from
long term bonds of Credit Suisse, Switzerland's third largest bank, and put
those of Swiss Bank Corporation, the second largest, on its watch list.
Mr Studer listed the group's SFr30.5bn in capital, reserves, margin for
subordinated bond issues and accumulated provisions, and concluded: 'Even if
we take into account that a part of the provisions will have to be utilised
in the future for writing off loan losses and for latent taxes, we may with
good conscience consider our capital and reserves as being very strong.'
UBS is the first of many Swiss companies expected to changes in the Swiss
companies law which comes into effect July 1.
Mr Ulrich Grete, executive vice-president, said the main purpose of this was
to bring the price of the shares down to levels that made it easier for
individuals to buy and sell them.
UBS will split both the SFr100 par value registered shares and the SFr500
bearer shares five for one.
Holders of UBS participation certificates (PCs) have been entitled to
exchange them into bearer shares at the rate of one share for every 25 PCs
since 1990.
Mr Grete said the remaining 462,000 PCs would be invalidated as of yesterday
and trading in them would halt on March 27. However, UBS would continue to
buy any offered after that date and exchange them in packets of 25 for
bearer shares.

<TEXT>
SANSUI Electric, the Japanese audio equipment maker acquired by Polly Peck
International, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of Y9.6bn (Dollars 74m), as
the company continued its attempts to restructure manufacturing operations
in Asia.
Sales totalled Y20.5bn, compared with Y16.3bn for a nine-month period in
1990, when the company's financial year was changed. Sales of audio
equipment, which account for about 90 per cent of total sales, were affected
by a downturn in the Japanese and international markets.
The company reported an after-tax loss of Y73.16bn, which it said arose from
costs associated with plant closures. In the previous period, it reported an
after-tax profit of Y413m and it is forecasting a profit of Y500m this year.
For the current year, the company forecasts sales of Y18bn, and a pre-tax
loss of Y3.5bn.

Hungarian venture

<TEXT>
FERRUZZI, the Italian agribusiness group, and Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food
and consumer products manufacturer, are to co-operate in taking over a
Hungarian company which is eastern Europe's largest oilseed producer.
Though no financial details of the deal were published, it is believed to be
worth about Dollars 100m.
That would make it by far the largest foreign acquisition in Hungary's food
and consumer goods industries, which have been the main target of western
investment in the country recently. In a two-stage transaction, Cereol
Holding, a Ferruzzi subsidiary, will acquire almost 90 per cent of the
state-owned Novenyolajipari es Mososzergyarto Vaallalat (NMV), which has
3,000 employees and had sales last year of Dollars 290m.
Cereol will keep NMV's oilseed business and will set up a joint venture with
Unilever to take over the Hungarian company's margarine, soaps and
detergents activities.
The joint venture will be owned 80 per cent by Unilever, which will manage
it, and 20 per cent by Cereol.
According to privatisation agency officials in Budapest, the Hungarian
government was keen to promote competition by separating the two sides of
NMV's operations, while neither Ferruzzi nor Unilever wanted to take over
the whole of the company's business.
NMV crushes about 850,000 tons of domestically grown oilseeds a year. The
takeover marks a further phase in the aggressive east European expansion
strategy of Ferruzzi, which is Europe's largest oil seed producer.
Eridania/Beghin Say, a Ferruzzi subsidiary, last year paid Dollars 40m to
acquire 40 per cent holdings in three Hungarian sugar companies, which
control about 40 per cent of the country's sugar market. These stakes are
due to be increased to 60 per cent.
Unilever said it would add international brands to NMV's margarine business,
the biggest in Hungary.

<TEXT>
ADAM &amp; Co, the privately-owned Edinburgh-based bank which serves high net
worth individuals, went against the trend of the big UK banks by producing
record pre-tax profits of Pounds 722,000 in the six months to December 31
1991, compared with Pounds 221,000 last time.
The bank is to pay its first interim dividend amounting to 1 per cent.
Mr James Laurenson, the managing director, pointed out that 1990 had been
depressed by a Pounds 236,000 loss on sterling futures. 'Even if you add
that Pounds 236,000 back in, the increase in net profit is still 58 per
cent,' he said.
The good result, he said, was because the bank Co was small and 'thus in a
good position to control all its activities.' Net interest income was Pounds
1.8m (Pounds 1.3m) and non-interest income from the bank's services was
Pounds 1.86m (Pounds 1.5m), with non-interest income continuing to account
for more than half operating income.

FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Banks give NHL 90 days' grace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL HOME Loans, the troubled mortgage lender and financial services
group, has won a 90-day breathing space from its banks.
The group spent last week negotiating with four syndicates of banks about
alterations to its borrowing arrangements. It is thought that the talks were
needed to prevent NHL defaulting on a technicality on funding arrangements
set up five years ago. This would have led to a set of cross-defaults
affecting up to Pounds 900m of its funding.
To retrieve the situation, NHL was obliged to obtain waivers by last night
from nearly 100 banks. During the week, Mr Jonathan Perry, the newly
appointed chairman and chief executive, denied that NHL was seeking either a
rescheduling or fresh funds from its banks.
Mr Perry declined to give further details of the negotiations. It was not
clear whether or not NHL would face further funding problems at the end of
the 90-day period.
Last July, a group of 10 banks agreed to put up a Pounds 200m cash life-boat
for NHL after local authorities began pulling deposits out of its banking
subsidiary, National Mortgage Bank, in the wake of the BCCI collapse.
Yesterday Mr Perry said that the group had achieved its first objective and
he would now concentrate on putting NHL on a sound financial footing and
managing the arrears in its Pounds 700m mortgage book.

THE BIG showdown at Great Western Res-ources ended in a big let down.
Despite a string of anonymous faxes to newspapers warning of trouble at the
company's annual meeting, the main character, Mr Daniel Pena, the flamboyant
but ousted former chairman, failed to attend. Instead, he sent his proxy, a
soft spoken lawyer from Richards Butler dressed in a blue suit.
Directors shifted uneasily in their seats as she listed Mr Pena's grievances
and a raft of oblique allegations. Some current directors, she suggested,
had bought shares at a 'fortunate time.' But shareholders seemed happier to
head for some coffee after asking a couple of softball questions.
'At least no one threw anything at us', said Mr Bruce Patterson, a
non-executive director.
Mr Pena is only one of the problems confronting Great Western Resources, the
US-based but London-listed energy company. By its own admission it faces a
'life or death' court action in the US.
Its main customer, a South Carolina utility, has accused it of involvement
in fraud and price fixing and withheld payments. The company denies the
charges strongly. An individual accused by the utility of involvement in the
scheme died of gunshot wounds on February 2.
Its shares collapsed from 240p 18 months ago to 6p in early February. A
heady rally since then, during which several directors bought shares, has
been mirrored by a heavy fall. The share chart now looks like one of the
company's own oil derricks.
Deflecting Mr Pena's allegations was Mr Howard Wolf, who replaced him as
chairman with the tacit backing of the Kuwait Investment Office, the bemused
owner of 32 per cent of the company.
Mr Wolf, a Texan lawyer, answered questions engagingly but refused to be
photographed.
Meanwhile, Mr Pena is threatening his own broadside of writs, claiming
dismissal payments and punitive damages.
Mr Green, a shareholder from Scotland, asked what the company's prospects
looked like. After stumbling for an answer, Mr Wolf admitted that Mr Green's
view was as valid as his own.

paid Pounds 5.95m to buy the Hillsdown Group out of Lionheart, the
restructured UK home improvement, housewares and DIY company, writes Ian
Hamiliton Fazey.
Newell, which paid Pounds 2.5m for a 5 per cent stake last November, is now
Lionheart's largest shareholder with 13.5 per cent and has taken a seat on
the board to advise on strategy.
The Knutsford-based Lionheart was formed from the rescue of Spong by
Hillsdown, ECI and Scimitar in 1989, when Hillsdown paid Pounds 3.4m for an
8.7 per cent stake. Mr Paul Lever was recruited as chairman from Crown
Paints, where he was chief executive.
Mr Lever said yesterday losses had been turned round and the company would
be returning to the dividend list next month.

<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, the consumer electronics group, is taking a 29.5 per cent stake in
Betacom, which designs and distributes telephones, as an investment.
Amstrad will acquire 26.5 per cent from Cannon Street Investments and 3 per
cent from Mr Alan Sugar, its chairman. The price is 18p per share; Mr Sugar
bought his stake last year for 21p.
Telecommunications is an area in which Amstrad is becoming increasingly
interested and the investment provided benefits for both companies,
particularly with respect to product innovation and marketing, Amstrad said.
It has already announced a joint project with GEC Marconi to develop
reasonably priced video telephones for the consumer market. The group did
not, however, rule out the possibility that it may market Betacom's
telephones 'in some regions'.
Betacom, which has marketing strength in Germany, could in turn sell
Amstrad's fax machines'We look upon Amstrad as being a stronger holder of
our shares (than Cannon Street Investments),' said Mr Roger Roland, Betacom
chairman.

FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Falling gold price leaves Cluff lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLUFF RESOURCES, the UK mining company with operations in Zimbabwe, blamed
low gold prices for a 6 per cent fall in 1991 pre-tax profits to Pounds
2.35m.
Earnings per share fell to 1.65p (2.43p) but the board is proposing a
same-again 1p dividend. The results were also affected by Zimbabwe's
temporary restriction on foreign currency in the first half because of the
Gulf war. That delayed the purchase of essential equipment for the Freda
Rebecca mine and as a consequence, total gold output in Zimbabwe fell from
74,675 troy ounces to 67,733 ounces - including 4,638 ounces (6,509 ounces)
from the Royal Family mine.
Mr Algy Cluff, chairman, said Freda Rebecca produced at record levels in
December.
Improved operation efficiencies helped reduce the average cost per ounce
produced last year from Dollars 234 to Dollars 228.
Mr Cluff said the company was in the lower half of world gold production
costs and, if the potential Ayanfuri mine in Ghana went into production -
probably in mid-1993 - 'we should be in the lowest quartile.'
Gold reserves and resources at Freda Rebecca had been raised during the year
by 13 per cent from those at the end of 1990 to 1.18m ounces, he reported.
Analysts described the results as creditable in the circumstances.

losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARCADIAN International, the property development company formed by Mr Robert
Breare and Mr Jeremy Priestley, who built up Parkdale Holdings in the late
1980s, reduced its pre-tax loss from Pounds 2.29m to Pounds 592,000 in the
six months to October 31.
Arcadian, which reversed into Westminster and Country Properties in 1990 and
then raised Pounds 5.5m in a rights issue to buy Smithfield Developments,
has been selling its commercial property portfolio and setting up leisure
developments in France, Spain, Italy and the UK.
It is chaired by Sir Peter Parker, as was Parkdale.
Turnover fell to Pounds 2.41m (Pounds 8.4m) as a result of the disposals.
The operating loss was Pounds 445,000.
Mr Breare said operating costs would be covered once it obtained equity
partners and other funding for its projects, for which it receives
management fees. The main one remaining to be financed was a resort near
Euro Disney, outside Paris.
Net debt currently stood at Pounds 900,000, gearing of about 14 per cent.
This followed a Pounds 2m convertible preference share issue.
Mr Breare said no account had been taken so far of the increased value of
the sites.
Losses per share were 6.7p (16.8p).

FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Capital &amp; Counties shares drop as assets
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Capital &amp; Counties, the property subsidiary of TransAtlantic
Holdings of South Africa, yesterday fell from 180p to 166p when it announced
a 29 per cent fall in net assets during 1991. Increased interest costs
dragged down pre-tax profits from Pounds 53m to Pounds 29m.
Its net assets per share of 283p (400p) at the end of December fell well
short of the 312p forecast with its Pounds 102m rights issue last summer.
The steep decline stemmed from a lower-than-expected valuation of the
Thurrock Lakeside shopping centre, which accounts for 34 per cent of the
total portfolio. Lakeside was valued for the first time at Pounds 325m, some
Pounds 40m less than expected.
Mr Brian Jolly, the newly-appointed managing director, said he was 'a little
surprised' at the valuation, which he ascribed to the weakness of the
economy in the second half of last year and a lengthening of property
yields.
Mr Donald Gordon, chairman, said the Thurrock valuation was not 'a fair
reflection of the real worth of this exceptional asset.' He criticised the
'open market' method of valuation. The fall in pre-tax profits was the
result of a swing in interest from an Pounds 8.2m credit to a Pounds 21.1m
charge. This largely followed the company's 'conservative' decision to stop
capitalising interest on Lakeside four months early, adding an extra Pounds
15m to the interest bill.
CapCo struck a cautious note about this year's prospects, warning that the
completion of its development programme and the termination of interest
capitalisation was 'inevitably and normally bound to cause a diminution of
profit in the short term'.
Operating profits increased by 12 per cent from Pounds 44.8m to Pounds
50.2m. The injection of Pounds 102m equity capital, together with Pounds 64m
from property sales, kept gearing at 75 per cent at the year-end.
Earnings per share fell from 24.4p to 10.6p. The final dividend is 5p,
making a total of 10p (13.2p), as foreshadowed with the rights issue.
Mr Jolly, formerly deputy managing director, took over as managing director
a week ago from Mr Ray Moorman, who wished to take early retirement.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Govett Atlantic Investment Trust yesterday unveiled plans for a
reconstruction following pressure from shareholders to produce proposals to
eliminate the discount to net assets at which the shares have been trading,
writes Philip Coggan, Personal Finance Editor.
The plan is for the trust to be wound up and for the assets to be divided
among two successor funds. Part will transferred into a limited life
investment trust, to be called Govett American Smaller Companies Trust, but
the majority will be transferred into one or more Govett-managed unit
trusts, including a North American fund.
Unit trusts trade at asset value so by selling their units for cash,
investors will be able to realise over 50 per cent of their holdings in
Govett Atlantic at asset value.
Two investment groups, ST Partners and Buchanan Partners, recently
requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting calling on the managers to
produce reconstruction plans. Details of the proposals will be posted to
shareholders by March 12.

FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Lloyds Chemists in Pounds 91m agreed bid
for Macarthy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS Chemists, the retailer which is number two to Boots in the UK market,
yesterday made an agreed Pounds 91m offer for Macarthy, owner of the Savory
&amp; Moore chain and originally the subject of three rival bids.
If Lloyds' bid goes through - and UniChem, the drugs wholesaler, had not yet
ruled itself out of contention - it will end more than nine months of
uncertainty for Macarthy.
Lloyds took less than two days to win over the Macarthy board after the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission on Wednesday cleared the way for both it
and UniChem to bid again.
Macarthy was first, but unsuccessfully, wooed by Grampian Holdings, the
Scottish mini-conglomerate, which put in a bid on May 22 last year when the
target's share price stood at 168p.
Lloyds joined the fray in August with a bid of one new share plus 21p cash
for each Macarthy share, which lapsed on the MMC referral.
The new bid is either a 1-for-1 share offer, valued at 327p a share last
night, or 305p a share in cash. The latter is 22 times Macarthy's 1990-91
earnings per share of 13.8p.
Mr Allen Lloyd, chairman and chief executive, said that after the
MMC-imposed delay it had proved much easier to get underwriting for a cash
offer. Last August 'the biggest criticism of our bid was that it came too
soon after the previous rights issue'. Less than four months earlier it had
raised Pounds 71m in a 1-for-2 issue to pay Pounds 55m for the Kingswood
chemists' and the Holland &amp; Barrett health stores.
The acquisition of Macarthy would involve the company in issuing up to 29.5m
new shares, compared with the present total of 86.5m.
Mr Dick Steele, finance director, said that the pro forma balance sheet for
the enlarged group would show gearing of roughly 60 per cent on net assets
of Pounds 80m. At the June year-end, Lloyds had Pounds 5m cash but
acquisition-related spending totalled nearly Pounds 20m since then -
including Pounds 8m on a 9.9 per cent stake in Macarthy.
The target's net debt stood at nearly Pounds 15m in September, when its net
assets were Pounds 25.1m. Since then outgoings included Pounds 3.1m in
capital spending and Pounds 1.4m dividends. Acquisition costs would include
Pounds 800,000 in severance payments to Macarthy's directors plus office
closure and redundancy bills.
After the acquisition, Lloyds would have 1,280 stores (chemists', drugstores
and health stores) compared with 1,079 now. Macarthy adds 172 chemists' and
29 health stores. In the year to June 30, Lloyds increased its pre-tax
profit by 53 per cent to Pounds 20.8m on sales of Pounds 258m; earnings per
share went up 21 per cent to 20.96p. Macarthy made Pounds 5.31m pre-tax on
sales of Pounds 205.8m in the year to September.
Lloyds' offer has been irrevocably accepted by Govett Strategic Investment
Trust, which owns 16.8 per cent of the shares, giving the bidder a total of
26.7 per cent so far.

BICC, the cables and construction group, is buying one of the leading cable
businesses in what used to be East Germany for DM63m (Pounds 22m).
KWO, which has four factories in the Berlin area, is being bought from the
Treuhand, the government agency responsible for privatising former
state-owned concerns. It makes power cables and metallic and optical
telephone cables.
Last year KWO had turnover of DM310m and it lost DM32m pre-tax. That
excluded 'excess employee costs' of DM70m, which BICC said it was not
assuming. BICC has agreed to a DM80m investment programme over the next two
years.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Perilous niches' (February 26), implies that the Morgan
Motor company manufactures instant antiques. Morgan cars perform their
designed purpose better than cars from the mass producers.
Occam said: 'It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer.' Morgan
applies the dictum very well.
For example, four-wheel steer is achieved by the dynamic characteristics of
the suspension while other manufacturers employ complex linkages, which will
suffer from wear; or, as BMW does, by means of electronic signals from
speedometer, front wheels and steering column operating hydraulic actuators
acting on the suspension.
As a consequence, Morgan will out-brake (even without ABS) and out-corner
other cars, to the good of primary safety.

Sir, In his profile of Chris Patten (February 25), Philip Stephens
inaccurately blames piles of research papers for extracting a 'sizeable
chunk from the Brazilian rain forests'.
This is a common misconception which has been widely adopted. In fact, the
destruction of the Brazilian rain forests is in no way connected with the
production of paper. Tropical hardwoods are unsuitable for paper-making.
Wood pulp which is exported from Brazil comes primarily from eucalyptus
plantations, carefully managed and grown specifically for pulp production.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Dealing with the deficits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIGHTING the general election campaign is, by now, the all-consuming passion
of every UK politician. But none but the most superstitious will be able to
resist the temptation to peer past polling day at the economic challenges
they might face in government. Yet those who dare to raise their heads above
the parapet are in for a nasty shock. Things could hardly get worse than
they have been over the past eighteen months; but the immediate future looks
none too rosy.
For Mr Major and his chancellor the next few weeks of economic news will
provide quite enough gloom. If they can survive the longest recession since
the second world war and win an election with no recovery in sight, they can
probably survive any nasty shock that the post-recession period can throw
up. But Mr Major must still be dreaming of the autumn days when he was able,
briefly, to contemplate an early election.
The recovery promised by the Treasury then has failed to materialise.
Indeed, the economic outlook has, if anything, deteriorated since. Consumers
have suffered a discontented winter, burdened by high real interest rates
and unprecedented debts that are being deflated, not inflated, away. They
have refused to start borrowing and spending again, depressing domestic
output and provoking companies into a second phase of retrenchment and
job-shedding. January's unemployment tally sent shivers down the spines of
nervous southerners and Tory pollsters. But the recent rash of redundancies
 -at Ford, BT and Jaguar to name just three - suggests that February's total
will be similarly bad.
To make matters worse, the world economy has also turned decidedly sour,
depressing exports and making a mockery of the Treasury's forecast of an
export-led recovery. The unexpectedly sharp rise in the trade deficit has
simply added to the air of general economic malaise that currently engulfs
the UK economy. It may have strengthened Mr Major's mis-placed claim that
the world economy is to blame for the absence of recovery. But few are
fooled.
Advance warning
Yet perverse as it may seem, this latest rise in the trade deficit provides
an advance warning of economic problems of a very different hue: it is now
possible to imagine the day when too much, not too little, growth will again
be the bugbear of UK economic policy-makers. When the recovery does come, it
will be consumer spending, not investment or exports, that leads the way.
But the propensity of UK consumers to buy foreign goods, and the seeming
inability of UK manufacturers to compete with them, means that imports will
soak up much of the new demand for manufactured goods. Even at the bottom of
this recession, with import demand at its most depressed, the UK trade
account has remained in deficit. Once growth resumes, the deficit will also
start growing.
Higher unemployment
The UK will be able to finance this deficit by borrowing from abroad, but
the question is at what price. The higher the deficit, the larger the
interest rate differential with Germany within the exchange rate mechanism
that will be needed to reassure nervous foreign investors that they will not
be repayed in devalued pounds. The consequence of higher interest rates
could be yet another cycle of below-trend growth and higher unemployment.
The Institute of Fiscal Studies, for example, estimates that annual growth
will be around 2 1/4 per cent up to 1995, half a percentage point below
trend.
Yet slow growth means deficit problems of a second, fiscal, variety. Lower
than expected growth this year and the likelihood of pre-election tax cuts
mean that whoever wins the election will inherit a budget deficit that
exceeds 4 per cent of gross domestic product in the coming fiscal year. But
the public spending plans announced in last year's autumn statement were
based on a trend growth rate of 3 per cent a year. Below trend growth to
1995, unless accompanied by spending cuts or tax increases, will mean a
fiscal deficit over the economic cycle.
This twin combination of current account and fiscal deficits, familiar both
to the US in the 1980s and to many developing countries, cannot be sustained
for ever. The IMF, if asked, would in all probability recommend fiscal
retrenchment combined with an exchange rate devaluation, neither of which
appear in the manifesto of any British political party. The alternative is
high interest rates, slow growth and rising government indebtedness. None of
which makes attractive dreaming for any party hoping for power. For the
Tories, further tax cuts would appear increasingly irresponsible. For
Labour, re-distribution would have to be matched with higher taxes.
None of this will reduce the politician's appetite for power. For the
victor, the electoral chalice may not be poisoned; but it will be a bitter
draft.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Elephants in their sights: The arguments for lifting the
ivory trade ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Zimbabwean villager had a blunt riposte to the world's 'elefriends'
gathering in Kyoto this weekend, intent on maintaining a ban on ivory trade:
'Elephants eat people's food, and people are dying of hunger.'
The question of whether to lift the ban will be among the most controversial
issues this week at the triennial meeting of the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species (Cites). As a test case for the effectiveness of
trade measures in achieving environmental ends, it will provide important
signals for action in defence of endangered animal and plant species.
Although elephant populations have recovered in some areas, such as
Zimbabwe, since the imposition of a ban on ivory trade in 1989, the species
remains in danger. There is a heated debate over the extent to which the ban
on trade has been responsible for the slim, localised recovery and whether
extending the life of ban will sustain or undermine the future of the
elephant.
The danger facing the elephant is not in dispute. Africa's elephant
population slumped from 1.2m to 600,000 between 1980 and 1988. Total trade
in unworked ivory rose from about 200 tonnes a year in 1950 to about 1,000
tonnes a year in 1980, and remained at this level throughout the 1980s. The
total of ivory exported between 1979 and 1988 accounted for more than
700,000 elephants.
Since the imposition of the trade ban at the last Cites meeting in 1989,
there has been progress. Demand in Europe and the US for ivory has virtually
disappeared, according to customs statistics. Poaching has not been
eradicated, but in certain countries (notably in southern Africa) success
has been such that elephant herds now need to be culled.
But can the trade ban be credited for these successes? And can they be
maintained?
Evidence derived from the ivory trade debate suggests that the ban is
valuable as a source of publicity and has helped to reduce consumer demand
for ivory products. As long as legal ivory cannot be distinguished from
illegal ivory, a total ban also simplifies the international policing
effort. But there are also concerns among conservation groups that success
is only partly due to the ban and that illegal trade channels may expand and
reverse the progress which has been achieved.
Even the Worldwide Fund for Nature, a committed campaigner for maintaining
the ban, concedes in a report published this month: 'These dramatic drops
(in poaching) were brought about through increased law enforcement efforts.'
African governments which are calling for a lifting of the ban base their
case on the need to strike a balance between their rural communities and the
local elephant population. The concern underpinning Zimbabwe's call for a
resumption in trade is that the rising number of elephants, with their
voracious appetites, are threatening the livelihood of the agricultural
community. While they have no economic value, there is no incentive for
villagers to tolerate them. The Zimbabwean government insists, therefore,
that a controlled resumption of trading in ivory would provide villagers
with an incentive to tolerate and protect local elephant populations.
An alternative strategy is to promote Safari tourism. According to research
by Dr Edward Barbier at the London Environmental Economics Centre, the
annual value of ivory exports from Africa amounted to between Dollars 50m
and Dollars 60m in the 1980s: 'Other values of the elephant, such as its
importance to tourism earnings, may be considerably more significant,' he
says.
In a recent study of the economic value of elephants, colleagues at the
Centre pointed out that in Kenya, earnings from viewing elephants came to
about Dollars 25m a year - about 10 times the estimated value of poached
ivory exports from Kenya.
But despite the array of arguments mustered in favour of lifting the ban,
such a policy poses clear dangers. Resumed trading would provide an avenue
for poachers in countries where elephants remain under threat to 'launder'
illegal ivory by mixing it with ivory from legal culls.
Tests can now identify the DNA characteristics of individual pieces of
ivory. It is therefore technically possible to identify poached ivory. Just
how simply or effectively such tests could be administered is another
matter. It is clear that no retail purchaser of ivory could tell the
difference on a shop shelf, so oversight would need to be effective at
source.
Environmentalist groups, such as the Environmental Investigation Agency also
emphasise the practical difficulties of monitoring the ivory at its source.
They argue that corruption in large parts of Africa, and military conflict
in Mozambique and elsewhere, as reasons for doubting whether DNA testing
could be effective in preventing poached ivory from reaching world markets.
Thousands of miles from the arguments in Kyoto, the elephant is unable to
rest easily. Its security will not be guaranteed until demand in end-user
countries has been staunched; until village communities in Africa can see
some economic benefit from preserving this immensely disruptive pachyderm;
and until the corruption and conflict on which poaching thrives have been
brought under control.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Man in the News: The UN's protector of a fragile peace -
Marrack Goulding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Early yesterday morning Mr Marrack Goulding was in a New York hospital. Not,
happily, with gunshot wounds, although it well might have been: three days
earlier he had been fired on by pro-Iranian militiamen in south Lebanon
while inspecting the scene of an Israeli incursion into UN-policed
territory.
Mr Goulding's medical problem is more prosaic, though not unrelated to his
job as UN under secretary-general in charge of peacekeeping. Two months ago
he had what is normally a routine operation to correct Dupuytren's
contraction, a claw-like stiffening of the hand, but he has been in pain
ever since.
'I travelled too soon,' he explains. 'It got infected in the Western Sahara,
and then I had to go straight from there to Yugoslavia and had some rather
bizarre treatment in Zagreb.' Is it getting better? 'Not really. The medical
advice is not to get stressed out . . .'
He gives a hollow laugh. The chance of his being able to follow this advice
is clearly zero. Peacekeeping is in far too much demand these days to allow
any prospect of peace and quiet for the man in charge of it. Mr Goulding has
10 such operations under his command at present, including the
unprecedentedly ambitious task of bringing peace and reconstruction to
Cambodia, which involves supervising both the existing administration and
the election of a new one.
It is now six years since Mr Goulding ('Mig' to his friends) left the
British Foreign Office in mid-career - he was 48 and had been ambassador in
Angola - to join an organisation he then regarded as 'probably terminally
ill'.
He took over from Sir Brian Urquhart, a lifelong UN servant who had built up
the peacekeeping function virtually from scratch, drawing on his experience
in the British army where he served right through the second world war.
Mr Goulding, by contrast, served only three months in the Royal Artillery
before being medically discharged. He has a slightly 'hot-and-bothered'
manner which contrasts with Sir Brian's legendary unflappability.
But his nerve has held under fire, and he has grown into the responsibility.
His talents were rewarded earlier this month when Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali,
the new UN secretary-general (with whom Mr Goulding clearly has an easier
relationship than he did with his predecessor, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar),
kept him on, in charge of an enlarged department, as one of only eight under
secretaries-general where there were 17 before. Three years ago, when Mr
Perez de Cuellar separated peacekeeping from 'peacemaking' (ie: political
diplomacy), Mr Goulding felt slighted and frustrated that his own role was
confined to the former; but now he is quite happy with the division of
labour. 'It would be boring,' he adds, 'if we were back in the bad old days
when there were only five operations and nothing much was happening.' But
now 'new peacekeeping operations are cropping up at the rate of five a
year'.
Even more encouraging is the fact that, unlike in the past, most of these
operations can now be wound up after completing their mission according to a
timetable, instead of getting bogged down and dragging on year after year.
Thus all five of those set up in 1988-89 have now been completed: those that
supervised the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the ceasefire between
Iran and Iraq, the Cuban withdrawal from Angola and the independence of
Namibia, plus the observer group in Central America.
Mr Goulding admits, by contrast, to being 'very uneasy' about Yugoslavia,
which he fears may become 'another Unifil' - the luckless UN force which has
been in south Lebanon since 1978, and has become a target for both sides.
These fears are shared by Mr Boutros-Ghali. But both came to the conclusion
that the dangers if no UN force were sent to Yugoslavia would be even more
grievous.
There are, Mr Goulding explains, two kinds of peacekeeping operations. The
classic type, of which Yugoslavia is an example, is put in 'to create the
conditions in which negotiations can go on', usually by helping maintain the
ceasefire at the end of a war. The newer type, seen in Namibia, Cambodia,
Western Sahara and El Salvador, forms part of a political settlement which
has already been negotiated but requires an impartial third party to oversee
its implementation. In both types of operation, he stresses, it is crucial
that the peacekeeping side be fully informed and consulted by those who
negotiate the terms on which a peacekeeping force is to be sent in. In this
respect he regards the process in El Salvador, where he worked very closely
with his 'peacemaking' colleague Mr Alvaro de Sota, as a model; by contrast,
he describes the arrangements in Western Sahara, negotiated in great secrecy
by Mr Perez de Cuellar's special envoy Mr Issa Diallo (now head of the UN's
Economic Commission for Africa) as 'a disaster'. Similarly, Mr Goulding
feels hopeful that at least the worst pitfalls of Lebanon can be avoided in
Yugoslavia because in the latter case he was able to work very closely with
the special envoy, Mr Cyrus Vance, who negotiated the terms of the UN
force's deployment. Peacekeeping, as Mr Goulding himself puts it, has become
'the flavour of the decade'. Armenia is now calling for a UN force in
Nagorno-Karabakh, and who know which other ex-Soviet republics will soon
make similar demands. This is flattering, but Mr Goulding foresees problems.
One is money: already there is a head-on clash over the cost of the Yugoslav
operation between the Secretariat and the five permanent members of the UN
Security Council which, Mr Goulding says, are 'very reluctant to make
available the money we say it's going to cost'.
In the case of Namibia the Council drastically reduced the size of the force
Mr Goulding had asked for, and he blames this for the deaths of 333 people
when Swapo guerrillas swarmed across the Angolan frontier in April 1989,
straight into the guns of the South African army.
The second problem he sees is the management capacity of the Secretariat
itself, which is already 'stretched to breaking point'. 'Nobody round here
ever gets such a thing as a weekend, or can count on getting home before 10
or 10.30 any evening' - a fact his wife Susan ruefully confirms.
'We need more people, better financial and administrative procedures. We
must have the money available when we need it. At the moment we have no
authority to spend anything. We need reserves.'
But Mr Goulding stresses that he is not complaining about a job which has
'more than lived up to expectations'. His contract has been extended for a
year, but he says he would gladly serve another six.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Electric, the regional electricity company based in Newcastle upon
Tyne, will increase its prices by an average 2.6 per cent from April 1, it
said yesterday.
The increase, well below the forecast rate of inflation, is likely to
satisfy Offer, the industry watchdog which in October warned Northern and
six other companies that it thought they were overcharging customers and
might have to make refunds.
Northern said the increases - 3 per cent for domestic customers, 1.9 per
cent for small commercial and industrial customers and 1.2 per cent for
larger customers - were well below its forecasts for inflation of 4.2 per
cent for the year to October.
Offer said Northern's increases, the first to be announced by a regional
company this year, looked encouraging. However, it will check to ensure
Northern is within the inflation-linked formula regulating price rises.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Smaller businesses send mixed signal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MIXED picture of prospects for small and medium-sized businesses is shown
by three surveys published yesterday.
Business confidence is higher among businesses with a turnover of less than
Pounds 30m than among the country's top 600 corporations, according to
parallel surveys carried out by accountancy firm Kidsons Impey and the
Association of Chartered Treasurers.
This positive view is not mirrored in the latest NatWest quarterly survey of
small businesses, which found continued small-business pessimism about the
outlook for sales and employment levels in the first quarter of this year.
More businesses expected sales to fall than to rise, by a margin of 10
percentage points, while more companies expected job levels to fall, by a
record margin of 17 points.
There were some signs that the recession may have bottomed out, the NatWest
survey of nearly 1,700 businesses reported. More businesses reported lower
sales and lower employment levels in the fourth quarter of last year than
reported increases, but the negative balance was smaller than in the
preceding quarter.
The Kidsons Impey survey of 210 businesses showed 66 per cent of smaller
businesses were optimistic about their immediate prospects, while the
chartered treasurers' survey of 600 big companies found that just 50 per
cent were optimistic about their future.
Smaller companies were more optimistic about prospects for their sector,
with 55 per cent expecting an improvement against just 24 per cent of the
large companies.
The Kidsons Impey survey identified increased consumer demand as the factor
most small and medium-sized businesses viewed as essential for recovery,
while the NatWest survey said low turnover and lack of business were the
most common problem.
NatWest survey: Small Business Research Trust, School of Management, Open
University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA. Pounds 15 (Pounds 45 annual

FT  29 FEB 92 / Clearer issues at Mideast talks: How US-Israel relations
dominate the peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOURTH round of bilateral Middle East peace talks broke for the weekend
yesterday following another week of recrimination and accusations in
Washington, with progress on substance remaining elusive but the immediate
issues and negotiating tactics becoming clearer.
From the moment President George Bush and Mr James Baker, the secretary of
state, decided to launch a new peace initiative in the wake of the Gulf war
it was almost certain that its fate would be decided by the evolution of
relations between Israel and the US, its foremost financial, military and
diplomatic supporter.
Events in Washington this week have underscored how critical the relations
between the two governments have become and how the Israeli public will be
given a decisive role in the peace process at the June 23 general election.
Officials in Washington make little effort to disguise their belief that Mr
Bush and Mr Baker have, in effect, given up on Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's
prime minister. Last Monday offered additional evidence. In the morning Mr
Baker announced that the US would not provide loan guarantees of Dollars
10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) to help settle immigrants from the Soviet Union unless
Israel first stopped building new settlements on the Arab territory it has
occupied since 1967.
Later that day Israel submitted to the Palestinians a plan for an interim
self-governing arrangement in those territories. Without a strongly
restraining American arm, the proposals could have provoked an Arab walkout.
Not only did the plan insist that the Palestinians must accept the right of
unlimited numbers of Jews to live and continue to settle in the West Bank
and Gaza, but was also far more restrictive than Israeli proposals tabled
more than 10 years ago.
It could be interpreted as a hardline negotiating stance, but Mr Zalman
Shoval, Israel's ambassador to Washington, saw fit to describe the scheme as
generous.
The bitter response by Mr Shamir and some of his ministers to the US
announcement on loan guarantees has done nothing to help the Israeli case in
Washington. The famed power of the Jewish lobby has been little in evidence,
the media has been generally supportive of the administration's action and
there is growing fear among friends of Israel that Mr Shamir is in danger of
inflicting lasting damage on a relationship that has done more than any
other to sustain Israel over the past 40 years.
With even the majority of Israelis opposed to new settlements in the
occupied territories, the US administration has no problem in convincing its
own public of the correctness of a policy it has followed for 25 years. Mr
Baker repeats the total US commitment to Israel's security, but argues that
it will not be enhanced by providing loan guarantees of Dollars 10bn in
addition to the Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn that Israel already receives
annually from the US.
It is an argument well received by an American public that is increasingly
critical of US foreign aid levels, especially now the threat of communism
has all but been eliminated. And it is an issue on which, not unexpectedly,
the Arab delegations like to dwell.
While the Palestinians, Syrians, Jordanians and Lebanese have little
tangible to demonstrate from their presence in Washington, they are none the
less broadly playing the game scripted for them by the US. That is: to
remain patient and calm, and to appear reasonable in their demands.
The key issue for them is how long they can keep justifying this attitude
back home where, particularly in the occupied territories, new facts are
being created by Israel every day. But while they remain on board they have
an almost daily opportunity to put to the American public their own case,
which is beginning to sound rather close to the US administration's. For
that reason alone Israel is again demanding that the next round of talks
should be moved out of the US.
But the main unadmitted carrot dangling in front of most people involved in
the negotiations is the possibility that Mr Yitzhak Rabin's Labour Party
might beat the Likud of Mr Shamir in the Israeli elections. Mr Rabin has
promised to stop building settlements in the occupied territories and
favours exchanging some part of that land in return for full peace.
Voting for him can be presented as not only assisting the peace process but
opening the door to the loans needed to settle new immigrants in Israel
proper. It could also transform the atmosphere at the peace talks. But it
would not all be to the Arab advantage. The delegations are working well
together precisely because there is nothing on the table. The moment Israel
makes more interesting proposals will be when latent tensions begin to
surface within and between the Arab partners.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Japan's current account surplus soars in January
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S CURRENT account surplus soared in January to Dollars 3.06bn (Pounds
1.74bn) compared to Dollars 45m a year ago.
The huge increase in the broadest measure of Japan's external balances
resulted from an 8.1 per cent rise in the value of exports, a 5.6 per cent
decline in imports, and a 10.4 per cent decline in Japan's invisible trade
deficit, which includes non-trade items such as insurance and tourism.
Finance Ministry officials, however, said that the rise in the value of
exports was mostly accounted for by the increase in the value of the yen
over the past year. This also depressed the value of imports, as did a drop
in the price of oil compared to a year ago. Average oil import prices were
Dollars 19.02 a barrel, compared to Dollars 28.60 a year ago.
Many economists believe the huge year-on-year increases in Japan's external
surpluses which have been recorded for most of the past year, will begin to
level out in the months ahead. The continued high level of trade and current
account surpluses, however, are likely to prove a continuing source of
friction with Japan's trade partners.
Japan's exports rose to Dollars 23.3bn during the month, while imports fell
to Dollars 17.4bn, leading to a 90 per cent increase in the trade surplus to
Dollars 5.89bn.
Japan also posted a surplus in the long-term capital account of Dollars
3.5bn, compared to a deficit of Dollars 2.88bn a year ago. The surplus
reflected a continuing flow of foreign money into Japan, where foreigners
were net purchasers of Dollars 6.9bn in stocks and bonds. Japanese were net
sellers of Y2.39bn of foreign stocks, although they bought Y7.4bn in foreign
bonds.
Overtime work in Japanese manufacturing companies in January registered the
biggest year-on-year decline in 16 years, the Labour Ministry said
yesterday, in a reflection of the sharp slowdown of the Japanese economy.
Average overtime work in manufacturing companies with more than 30 employees
fell by 17.8 per cent during the month to 14.4 hours. Housing starts fell by
16.4 per cent, the 15th monthly decline running.

THE UN Security Council yesterday launched a peace-keeping and election
monitoring operation for Cambodia, the biggest ever undertaken by the world
body.
Initial estimates put the cost for a 15-month period at Dollars 1.9bn for
15,900 troops and thousands of civilian officials charged with supervising
elections.
However, it may prove possible to reduce costs after Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, the UN secretary general, reviews the situation during a visit to
Cambodia in April. After the Council's unanimous vote, he told members that
current plans were not definitive and there would have to be 'a measure of
flexibility in the conduct of this operation'.
He has asked for Dollars 200m in start-up money without delay in the hope
that the first contingents may be sent soon.

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ORDER intake at west German engineering companies took a sharp turn for the
worse in January, the VDMA manufacturers' association said yesterday.
A 16 per cent slump in export orders and a 2 per cent drop in domestic
demand combined to produce an overall real decline of 9 per cent compared
with the first month of 1991.
The figures suggest a significant worsening of business conditions,
particularly in export markets.
In the three months from November to January, export demand was down 9 per
cent and total orders were just 3 per cent lower than in the comparable
period 12 months earlier.
They also tend to confirm forecasts that growth in domestic output is
stagnating and indicate that expectations of economic recovery in the
engineering and plant industries' main markets in the US, Britain and France
have yet to spur increased capital investment.
Meanwhile, the IG Metall union warned engineering employers of more trouble
to come in pay negotiations due to start next week.
Mr Klaus Zwickel, the union's deputy chairman, announced widespread 'protest
action' in support of a 9.5 per cent pay claim for 4m workers.
The aim, he said, was to 'throw sand into the works' and to prove to the
employers that the union membership would not accept cuts in real wages. It
was prepared for and could afford a long struggle, including strikes, Mr
Zwickel added.
Gesamtmetall, the mechanical and electrical industries' employers' group,
has warned that 'unreasonable' wage settlements this year will lead to
losses of jobs. Its workforce fell 20,000 last year and numbers on
short-time increased four-fold to 131,000 as orders shrank.

</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE US voters hunt desperately for someone to lead them out of the
economic slump, the candidates for both Republican and Democratic
presidential nominations have set about proving that it is easier to attack
what your opponent stands for than to say what you stand for yourself.
Mr Patrick Buchanan, the former Nixon speechwriter who has honed his
invective through years of practice as a pugnacious television commentator,
has lifted his attack on President George Bush an octave higher in an effort
to inflict further damage on the president in a series of southern states.
Mr Buchanan countered a Bush campaign television advertisement challenging
his opposition to the Gulf War with an onslaught on President Bush for
allowing the federal government to finance 'pornographic and blasphemous
art' through the National Endowment for the Arts - long a target for the
Republican right.
His challenge could seriously damage President Bush in the south, with polls
suggesting that he could win 37 per cent of the Republican vote in Georgia
on March 3, matching his score in New Hampshire last week.
Among the Democrats, meanwhile, the campaign has become even more
vindictive, as the current frontrunner, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas,
provides a target for his three main challengers.
All the candidates are desperate for a win in one of the seven states,
including Georgia, Maryland, Colorado and Minnesota, that are to cast their
votes on Tuesday. They hope for a springboard to propel them into four more
ballots next Saturday and the 11-state 'Super Tuesday' on March 10.
Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa both
challenged Mr Clinton's 'electability' because of the allegations of
adultery and draft-dodging that have dogged his campaign.
But it was Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who lost part of his leg in
Vietnam, who led the charge with an assault on Mr Clinton's escape from the
Vietnam war draft.
Two weeks ago, Mr Kerrey said Mr Clinton's draft record should not be a
campaign issue. His campaign advisers have now decided, however, that if
they can damage Mr Clinton enough in Georgia and the South - where he has
been expected to win overwhelmingly - Mr Kerrey will be left as the only
credible nominee.
In this year's campaign the candidates started to build their campaigns so
late that all are short of funds and organisation. Desperate for an early
victory to enable them to raise more money and stay in the race, they now
appear ready to stoop lower than they might initially have hoped.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy grew at an annual rate of 0.8 per cent in the final quarter
of last year, slightly better than financial markets expected, revised
figures from the Commerce Department indicated yesterday.
The figures should provide a boost for the Bush administration, which is
trying to convince the electorate that the recession is over. Initial
estimates indicated growth of only 0.3 per cent at an annual rate in the
fourth quarter.
Real gross domestic product has now grown sluggishly for three quarters
following a sharp contraction in the winter of 1990 to 1991.
Many analysts, however, remain gloomy about the current quarter. In a speech
this week, Mr David Mullins, the vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve, said
he would not be surprised if the economy declined slightly. The Fed and most
private sector analysts expect moderate growth to resume by the middle of
this year.
The Commerce Department said the upward revision to GDP for the fourth
quarter mainly reflected a higher estimate of business inventories and
personal consumption, partially offset by lower net exports.
Yesterday's report, however, still pointed to a very weak economy. In real
terms, personal consumption, business fixed investment and federal
government purchases all declined relative to the third quarter. Overall,
gross domestic purchases declined at an annual rate of 0.3 per cent.
The rise in business inventories at the end of last year, moreover, is seen
as an involuntary reaction to weaker than expected demand. It has prompted
production cuts in the current quarter.
The Fed remains concerned by exceptionally weak consumer confidence - which
fell to a 17-year low this month - and by the failure of long bond yields to
decline in response to cuts in short-term interest rates. Bond yields
influence mortgage rates and hence the pace of housing recovery.
Yesterday's report, however, showed a further moderation in inflationary
pressures. The price index for gross domestic purchases - a broad measure of
inflation - rose 2.3 per cent in the fourth quarter compared with 2.5 per
cent in the third.

<TEXT>
THE European Commission is to appeal against Thursday's unprecedented court
ruling which cast doubt on the validity of the EC executive's internal
decision-making process and quashed fines imposed on 14 chemicals companies
for operating a cartel.
Several large EC groups are examining the judgment by the EC's Court of
First Instance (CFI) to find out whether they, too, have grounds for
challenging fines imposed on them.
The Commission will appeal to the European Court of Justice, the EC's
supreme judicial body. '(The Commission) does not share the lower court's
interpretation of its internal rules,' said a spokesman.
There is still debate among EC lawyers about the scope of the judgment. At
worst, Commission legal experts fear the ruling could undermine past
decisions in all areas of its activity, not just competition, and allow
aggrieved companies to challenge fines going back years. Normally,
complainants have only two months to appeal against a Commission decision.
The Dutch builders' federation, the SPO, had already intended to lodge an
appeal against a fine imposed by the Commission earlier this month for
operating an illegal cartel. Mr Louis van Lennep, the federation's lawyer in
Brussels, said yesterday the SPO was more interested in attacking the
substance of the Commission's decision. But he added: 'We will look at (the
ruling) of course, and if there is mileage in it we will use it.'
Aer Lingus, the Irish airline fined Ecu750,000 (Pounds 525,000) this week
for operating a restrictive ticketing system on the London-Dublin route,
said the judgment sounded 'extremely interesting'. The airline has not yet
decided whether to appeal against Wednesday's Commission decision.
The Commission is particularly concerned about the CFI's suggestion that the
official versions of all its decisions, which can appear in up to nine
languages, should be signed by Mr Jacques Delors, the president, and Mr
David Williamson, the secretary general.
To ease the bureaucratic load, the president and secretary general usually
sign only the minutes of the Commission meeting in which the decision took
place.

THE German parliament is expected to impose conditions on the country's
eventual membership of European economic and monetary union (Emu), when it
ratifies the Maastricht treaties later this year.
Both chambers of parliament, the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, plan to demand
the right to 'take stock' of Emu again in 1996, before moving to a single
currency and monetary union under phase three of the transition. Monetary
officials closely involved in the Emu negotiations say it is planned that
parliament should attach its own resolutions to ratification, to ensure that
a future German government would accept no dilution of the country's
commitment to monetary and price stability.
The parliament would demand a report from the government before the start of
phase three, in either 1997 or 1999, to ensure those resolutions had been
fulfilled.
The officials say there is no question of Germany seeking a back-door way of
opting out of economic and monetary union. The aim is rather to ensure that
the economic convergence criteria for membership, laid down at Maastricht,
are enforced equally strictly throughout the Community.
The move is seen as a way of reassuring a sceptical German public that the
move to a single currency and monetary union is not going to endanger their
national economy. At the same time it would restrict the government's room
for manoeuvre in accepting any dilution of the convergence criteria under
political pressure from other EC member states. That would be welcomed both
in the German Bundesbank and the Ministry of Finance, but not necessarily in
the Chancellor's Office and the Foreign Ministry.
The German parliamentary debate on Maastricht, due to begin about April, is
regarded with growing trepidation by high-level government officials. They
fear that the ratification process could be linked to a whole range of
EC-related grievances, as well as inner-German politics. Most of all they
fear the looming battle between the 16 federal states and the central
government for future control of the EC policy-making process.
Until now, the parliamentary criticism of Maastricht has focused on the
weakness of the treaty on political union as inadequate compensation for
German acceptance of Emu. However the public concern, reflected in opinion
polls and articulated in popular newspapers is now focused more on the loss
of the D-Mark in Emu.
The monetary officials suggest that if other EC members failed to display
sufficient determination in combatting inflation and controlling their
public spending, the German government would be able to refer to the
parliamentary resolutions to persuade them to fall into line. They could
also justify a German decision not to go ahead with the project on the
grounds that aspiring partner countries were not eligible.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Treuhand agrees to Krupp plan for east
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
KRUPP Stahl, one of Germany's leading steel groups, is to buy the Eko Stahl
company in Eisenhuttenstadt, near the Polish border.
The Treuhand, the state privatisation authority responsible for selling east
German assets, agreed late on Thursday to a complex restructuring plan put
forward by Krupp.
It includes building an electric scrap smelter, a hot rolling mill, and
spending DM350m (Pounds 121m) on modernising the existing cold rolling mill.
Total planned investment, including the DM75m purchase price of the concern,
will exceed DM1bn.
However, Krupp also wants government subsidies, which will need approval
from Brussels, for a substantial part of the renovation.
Combining its existing capacity with that of Eko, and Hoesch, which is also
being taken over, Krupp will become the fifth-biggest steel maker in Europe,
with raw steel capacity of around 10m tonnes.
The company, part of the Fried. Krupp group, has agreed to take on Eko's
5,750 workforce, of which around 2,000 are currently employed in
government-funded work creation schemes.
It expects to find permanent jobs for around 2,800 at Eko, and work for
another 1,000 in associated industries in steel tubes, transport and
construction steel processing, which are expected to set up nearby. Before
German unification Eko was East Germany's biggest steel works, employing
11,300.
Mr Jurgen Harnisch, chairman of Krupp Stahl, announcing the deal, said 1991
profits at the company, the only quoted part of the Fried. Krupp group,
would be markedly below the previous year's DM277m after-tax earnings.
Even so, it still expected to pay a dividend. Last year's DM5 pay-out was
the first for 16 years. The company had reacted quickly to deterioration in
the steel market and cost-cutting had saved it more than DM130m over the
year.

<TEXT>
THE European Commission has proposed that EC countries relax controls on
drug prices and introduce more competition to the drugs markets, Reuter
reports from Brussels.
The draft guidelines propose that national governments abandon direct price
controls; require insured patients to pay a significant share of drug costs;
and encourage pharmacists to use the cheapest products.
A Commission official said the text was likely to change after
consultations. The Commission was not yet ready to propose something more
radical, such as an EC-wide pricing system, because that would involve
overhauling national social security systems. Most EC countries try to limit
health care spending by fixing drug prices, either directly or indirectly.
But the Commission says the controls have not reduced costs. 'On the
contrary, they have contributed to making the pharmaceutical market more
rigid, by neutralising competition,' it says in a document explaining its
draft proposals.
The Commission also proposes harmonising package sizes to make it easier for
companies to sell their products internationally.

FT  29 FEB 92 / Hurd attacks opposition proposals for Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HURD, the foreign secretary, yesterday led a Tory offensive against
opposition proposals for constitutional change in Scotland, labelling
Labour's plan for a devolved parliament as 'disingenuous and devious'.
He also attacked the Scottish National party's proposal for an independent
Scotland within the EC.
His remarks came as serious divisions arose among supporters of a devolved
Scottish parliament. In Edinburgh, disagreements emerged over the electoral
system for a Scottish parliament at a public meeting of the Scottish
Constitutional Convention. The convention, composed mainly of Labour and
Liberal Democrat politicians, has been drawing up a blueprint for a Scottish
parliament.
The convention proposes that the parliament would have two members for each
of the 72 Scottish constituencies elected by the first-past-the-post system.
On top of those 144 MPs, between 36 and 50 members would be elected from
party lists, bringing the total number of seats won by each party more
closely into line with the votes cast. This would make a total of between
180 and 194 MPs.
To ensure gender equality, parties would be under statutory obligation to
put up equal numbers of men and women. The additional member system would be
used to enforce the same principle.
Mr Murray Elder, secretary of the Labour party in Scotland, confirmed that
Labour accepted the abandonment of the first-past-the-post system to elect a
minority of members of the Scottish parliament. However, he said, the total
number of MPs being proposed was too big to be workable.
Mr Christopher Mason was one of several Liberal Democrats, including a
number of women, who disagreed with the proposals for gender equality. He
said it was 'a democratic nonsense' that a person who received fewer votes
might be elected in place of someone with more votes because of being the
'wrong' sex.
Mr Hurd, speaking at Renfrew near Glasgow, accused Labour of backing a
devolved parliament in order to take power in Scotland.
It also intended to improve its chances of governing the UK by 'retaining
arrangements at Westminster incompatible with devolution', he said.
It was 'patently absurd and unfair' to 'strip the Westminster parliament of
the right to legislate on most Scottish matters, but then let Scots MPs
determine those same areas of policy for England, Wales and Northern
Ireland'.
As for the SNP's policy of independence in Europe, it was a fantasy that
'Scotland could slide out of the UK and slide simultaneously into the EC as
an equal and independent state'. It would probably have to negotiate entry
into the EC, he said.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Offshore Centres
(8): New hub for financial services emerges - Tim Coone looks at Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN JUST three years, Dublin's International Financial Services Centre (IFSC)
has emerged from a derelict docklands site to be a new European hub for the
management of the financial assets of some of the biggest corporations in
the world.
Since the first, new office block on the 27-acre site opened in 1990,
familiar names associated with diverse manufacturing activities, such as
IBM, Alcan, Volkswagen, Volvo, Grand Metropolitan and Outokumpu, have all
chosen Dublin as a location from which to manage their world-wide corporate
treasury operations.
Others, such as Asea Brown Boverie, BMW, Ericsson and Coca-Cola, have chosen
the IFSC as the hub from which to manage their world-wide insurance needs.
Large corporations such as these, with manufacturing assets and properties
scattered in scores of locations around the world, set up their own
insurance companies through which their subsidiaries then place their
property insurance.
Captive insurance, as it is known, 'has developed well and quite
unexpectedly', according to Mr Brendan Logue, the manager of the financial
services programme at Ireland's Industrial Development Authority (IDA),
which is responsible for the overseas marketing of the IFSC. On the back of
this business, re-insurance operations have also grown rapidly.
Far from being a glass and chrome shell, housing dubious 'brass-plate'
operations often associated with offshore centres, the IFSC now has 140
financial services companies, giving direct employment to 986 people.
One hundred and ninety five projects have been approved, which have made
commitments to employ eventually almost 3,000 people.
Originally the brainchild of Mr Dermot Desmond, a controversial but
forward-looking Irish businessman, the IFSC was conceived as a means of
transforming the derelict docklands area of Dublin into a new European
financial centre, which would complement the growth in new manufacturing
industries that have sprung up across Ireland under the stimulus of the IDA.
Ireland offers many advantages compared with rival centres such as
Luxembourg and the Channel Islands, through lower wage and housing costs, a
skilled and abundant labour force and good communications with other
European business centres.
The IFSC is just a 10-minute walk from Dublin's city centre and a 20
minutes' drive from the airport. The development site has plenty of room for
expansion and is planned to have complementary developments of a 300-bedroom
hotel, a marina, shopping and restaurant facilities and residential
properties.
If a planned development of a Light Rail Transport (LRT) system gets EC
approval and funding this year, much of Dublin's traffic congestion problems
can also be overcome, which is one of the city's few drawbacks for
developers of services-related industries.
One of the key attractions without doubt, though, is a favourable 10 per
cent corporate tax rate for companies that set themselves up in the IFSC,
similar to the rate for manufacturing companies that establish in Ireland.
In 1990, the European Commission approved a five-year extension to 2005 for
the application of this rate to the IFSC, acceding to Ireland's argument
that its peripheral location within the EC and high unemployment rate
justified preferential treatment. Other incentives include 100 per cent
first-year capital allowances for development expenditure by
owner-occupiers, 100 per cent first-year capital allowances on plant and
equipment expenditure, 200 per cent tax deductable rent allowances for
tenanted properties and rates exemptions.
A measure of the IFSC's growth is given by the Revenue Commissioners' latest
figures on corporation tax payments by companies established in the centre.
In 1988, its first year of operation, the IFSC generated IPounds 3.7m in
revenue. By 1990, this had grown to IPounds 48.2m. Figures for 1991 are
expected to be close to IPounds 70m. This would imply profits of some
IPounds 700m generated by the 140 firms so far established. Business
turnover would thus be maybe 10 times greater.
The loss of tax revenues by other EC states has led to the first big row
over the IFSC's privileged status within the EC. The German government,
finding itself pressured by the mounting costs of the country's
reunification, is amending its tax legislation, making corporate profits
subject to the same 56 per cent tax rate regardless of source.
One of the IFSC's attractions has been the possibility for cash-rich firms
to place their surplus cash in investment funds which are then managed in
Dublin by specialist companies. Profits are taxed at the 10 per cent rate
and can be repatriated without further tax liabilities due to Ireland's
double taxation treaties with its EC partners.
Many leading foreign banks, such as Dresdner Bank, Citibank, Chase Manhattan
and Deutsche Bank, have established fund management operations in Dublin.
The head of one such company said the change in legislation could put an end
to the management of German corporate investment funds through Dublin. 'The
big risk for the IFSC is that other countries may follow the German
example,' he said.
Others are not so pessimistic, however. Under the proposed tax changes in
Germany, only if the overseas tax rate is less than half that of Germany's
will the difference have to be paid to the German tax authorities.
Fund managers have the possibility of organising their business managed
through Dublin to generate an overall tax liability of around 30 per cent of
profits, thereby avoiding the full 56 per cent rate in Germany and still
making Dublin attractive.
Failing that, one institutional fund manager pointed out that companies
could challenge the new tax legislation through the German and European
courts, as it would violate the double taxation treaty between Germany and
Ireland and undermines the spirit of the EC legislation which gives the IFSC
its privileged status.
In the debate over the tax changes, one of the problems has been to agree a
definition of what constitutes 'active' as opposed to 'passive' management
of funds in offshore centres. Mr Logue, of the IDA, said: 'We have different
interpretations. For the Germans, corporate fund management must be part of
the overall business. They object to the splitting-off of fund management
activity. Our certification concept is based on movement and business
activity but does not qualify as far as the German legislation is
concerned.'
He said that the proposed changes should not have a big impact on Dublin,
though. 'It is only the corporate fund management business that is most
vulnerable and the additional taxes will be applicable to whatever location
the funds are managed through, putting Dublin at no special disadvantage.'
He said that Dublin's other large areas of business, mainly corporate
treasury management and insurance activities, will not be affected by the
new legislation. 'The worst situation would just be a continuation of the
uncertainty,' he said.
Mr Bernard Hanratty, vice-president of Citibank in Dublin, said that in the
past six months since the German tax debate began 'there has been no
increase in institutional investment management business from the German
companies.'
Nonetheless, like Mr Logue, he believes that the IFSC's long-term future
lies with treasury management, mutual funds and insurance. Dublin's tax
advantages disappear in 13 years' time but he said that this is sufficient
time for institutions to recover their establishment costs of re-locating in
Dublin.
With 550,000 square feet of office space completed at the IFSC, the
government, through its Customs House Docks Authority, is now negotiating
the centre's second stage of development, which includes a museum, an hotel,
retail facilities, housing and further office buildings. Prospective
companies wishing to take advantage of the centre's tax breaks have until
the end of 1994 to obtain certification.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Offshore Centres
(7): Singular breakthrough - Gibraltar has been revamping its facilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GIBRALTAR is looking more like a successful offshore finance centre than
ever before. It has a considerable amount of new office space and markedly
improved telecommunications. More important, it was recently the base for
the largest placement of preference shares on the US market by a non-US
bank.
For the past four years the British Crown Colony on the tip of southern
Spain has been revamping its facilities and promoting itself as a tax
efficient base serving EC banks and corporations. Gibraltar has equipped
itself with digital fibre optics and a high quality development has sprung
up on reclaimed land.
Just as the new offices are being completed so the megadeals appear to have
finally arrived on the Rock.
The US issue launched from Gibraltar last November, which was fully
underwritten and subscribed, raised Dollars 345m, and the capital, in the
form of non-voting shares, ranked as locked-in, high-grade capital, or Tier
one under the Basle Accord. The key feature of the deal was that capital
duty exposure was substantially eliminated by using Gibraltar as its base.
It was a singular breakthrough and there is evidence that similar
significant business will go to Gibraltar instead of, for example, to
Luxembourg. The deal woke up financial directors to the capital-raising
possibilities afforded by the colony.
However, while there is an unquestioned silver lining to Gibraltar's horizon
it is no less evident that the black clouds of the political dispute which
envelops the Rock remain in place.
Spain is pressing for territorial sovereignty over the colony and the
overwhelming re-election of the uncompromising Gibraltarian nationalist Mr
Joe Bossano in January as the Rock's chief minister has brought the dispute
more sharply into focus.
Mr Bossano rejects any cession of sovereignty to Spain and the Spanish
parliament has responded by unanimously carrying a motion which
significantly strengthens the Madrid government's hand in its equally
uncompromising approach to the dispute.
The acrimonious stalemate colouring Gibraltar's future political status
makes it all the more remarkable that the bank which so successfully used
the Rock to raise capital on the US market should have been none other than
the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, BBV, Spain's largest retail bank. BBV owns a
subsidiary on the Rock which holds a B licence and is thus authorised by the
Banking Commission of Gibraltar to conduct offshore business.
BBV had first examined the possibility of launching its issue from
Luxembourg. It opted for Gibraltar, according to well-placed local legal
sources, because the system of non-voting shares is better understood on the
Rock. Shareholders can be disenfranchised under Gibraltar's UK-based Common
Law jurisdiction whereas in general all shares issued in a continental Civil
Law code environment, such as Luxembourg's, must carry voting rights.
Gibraltar's Common Law gives the Rock's substantial population of
specialised lawyers and accountants an obvious edge for certain types of
business. The colony's other obvious attraction is its cost efficiency. This
is true for share issues because under Gibraltar's legislation capital duty
is not paid on the premium, and it is true, also, for bond issues where duty
is capped at Pounds 5,000.
BBV's initiative nevertheless runs counter to a prevailing official view in
Madrid that seeks to pressure Gibraltar, and the UK, by isolating it as much
as possible. There is no enthusiasm whatsoever in Madrid for the
consolidation of Gibraltar as an offshore centre independent from Spain.
Spain's pressure tactics are resisted by the UK which stands by its
commitment to the 20,000-odd Gibraltarians that there can be no change in
the Rock's sovereignty unless it is sanctioned by them.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Offshore Centres
(6): In search of fiscal nomads - The attractions of Andorra, Cyprus,
Madeira, Malta, Monaco, San Marino and Trieste investigated by Paul Ham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL HAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISLANDS and enclaves on the periphery of Europe are falling over themselves
to declare to the world their fiscal neutrality.
Madeira, Malta, Cyprus and even - on the edge of a battlefield - Trieste,
have declared themselves 'open for offshore business'.
These tax havens, or 'offshore financial centres', to use the preferred
euphemism, are especially keen on attracting the wallets of the growing
numbers of 'high net worth' tax exiles, otherwise known as Perpetual
Tourists or Fiscal Nomads.
With the exception of Trieste, which wants to use tax shelters as a way of
providing cheap finance to eastern Europe, and Campione, which is more a
casino, the peripheral havens are targeting their tax-incentives and fiscal
holidays primarily at wealthier investors in Europe.
So far, they have succeeded mainly in luring expatriates from countries on
their doorstep: hence Italian expatriate investors are especially prevalent
in Malta, Portuguese and Spanish in Madeira, and Greek investors in Cyprus,
for the same reasons that British expatriates comprise a large portion of
accountholders in the Channel Islands.
But the smaller offshore centres resent the notion that they may be
categorised merely as 'pet havens' to a particular European country.
Like the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, they want to be 'all things to
all tax avoiders'.
They want to appeal to the American, South-East Asian as well as to the
European investor. The smaller havens want to be seen as finance centres on
the grand, international scale.
Revenue from offshore finance is expected greatly to increase their public
coffers where the sale of Madeira wine, Cypriot olives or Maltese religious
icons have failed to do so. On the eve of Europe's 'Single Market', which is
expected to introduce 'tax sharing' arrangements between member countries,
such offshore centres want to present a saleable service to Europeans
burdened by onerous EC taxes: a highly confidential, tax-free environment
for investment.
Madeira is trying to release itself from the hegemony of Portugal by pushing
for new laws giving it greater autonomy. Indeed, Lisbon is expected to
approve in the next six months a new law granting Madeira the right to allow
the subsidiaries of foreign banks, insurance companies and fund managers to
set up on the island. At present, only branches of foreign companies are
allowed to operate in Madeira.
The change would, according to Leonel Silva, a manager at the Madeira
Development Company, greatly increase Madeira's capacity to accept and
manage offshore investments.
Already, fund managers from the UK and Portugal are 'queuing up' to benefit
from the new rule, Mr Silva said. One is Lloyds Fund Management, which wants
to launch a new Latin American fund from Madeira. Others include Credit
Lyonnais and the leading Portuguese banks, which already have branches on
the island but want to launch fund management operations there. Companies
outside Madeira are chasing the island's indigenous wealth. Recently, Banco
Internacional de Funchal (BANIF) and Midland Montagu reached a joint
agreement to distribute a Luxembourg-based umbrella fund, the Midland
International Circuit Fund, in Portugal and Madeira.
The new ruling will also allow captive insurance companies to set up in
Madeira. The island hopes to become a fresh force in the captive market,
hitherto dominated by Bermuda and Guernsey.
Madeira has four main areas of offshore activity: an offshore financial
centre, primarily for corporate clients (such as banks and insurers); a free
trade zone; an international financial services centre, for services to
wealthy private investors; and an international shipping register.
In the Mediterranean, the two fiercest rivals for the offshore investors'
pocket are Malta and Cyprus. These 'older' fiscal paradises have a keen eye
on European investors and offshore companies, particularly in the UK, Italy,
Germany and Scandinavia. Malta has been known to pursue marketing strategies
to attract a specific clientele; one such campaign succeeded for several
weeks last year in luring two planeloads of Icelandic investors every
fortnight.
Cyprus and Malta strive to outdo each other in providing an offshore
environment which, in fiscal and regulatory terms, balances a laissez-faire
attitude to business behaviour with strict confidentiality and virtual
tax-freedom.
Cypriot tax incentives include: a 4.25 per cent tax on the income of
offshore companies (such 'companies' are more often than not receptacles for
an individual's private assets); total exemption from income tax for local
branches of foreign companies; no withholding tax on dividends; the taxing
of foreign employees in Cyprus at half the standard rate; no capital gains
tax on the sale or transfer of shares in an offshore company; no estate duty
payable on the inheritance of shares in an offshore company; and no import
duty on the purchase of cars, office or household equipment for foreign
employees.
Ralph Shipley, a director of Wardley Cyprus, described Cyprus as 'Europe's
best-kept secret . . . Cyprus always promoted itself as a complete offshore
centre and not as a tax haven.'
The Cyprus parliament is due to introduce two bills this year, the
International Trust Bill, which updates existing legislation on trusts
arranged by non-resident investors in Cyprus; and a Financial Services Bill,
which will give Cyprus the authority to license and supervise financial
services companies. The trust legislation has been described by the Central
Bank of Cyprus as a copy of UK Trustee Law, where incentives depend on the
beneficiary's country of domicile.
The Financial Services Bill will seek to maintain ethical standards of
business practice and outlaw fraudulent operators. The Cypriots are at pains
to emphasise the high standards they are applying. Independent financial
advisers have not been admitted since 1987 without a 'Letter of Comfort'
from an outside guarantor, prepared to underwrite the firm's operations to
protect investors.
After 15 years of wooing foreign investors, Cyprus has attracted 20 offshore
banking units entitled to tax breaks and customer benefits.
Banks, too, are subject to careful vetting; they must be branches or
subsidiaries of 'reputable' firms already in existence in another
jurisdiction, as must any financial company wanting to set up.
Malta, meanwhile, is moving quickly to lure foreign investors away from the
traditional expatriate financial centres.
After the return to power of Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami's government
at the general elections on February 22, the island is resuming the task of
forging the biggest offshore financial services centre in the southern
Mediterranean.
This will involve consolidating its offshore company law and introducing a
new law authorising the practice of investment business on the island.
The latter means allowing Ucits (undertakings for collective investments in
transferable securities - European mutual funds, in short) to be set up in
Malta.
According to a recently published book, Maltese offshore companies (most of
which are individual holding companies) pay no tax if they are
'non-trading'; pay 5 per cent tax if they are 'trading'; pay no death duties
on the inheritance of shares; pay no tax on loan interest or dividends; and
pay reduced income taxes on earnings of non-Maltese employees in Malta.
Malta has regulations: the Offshore Trust Act and the International Business
Activities Act, both of 1988, laid down the basic ground rules of the
offshore centre. They did this by exempting offshore entities from most of
the Common Law domestic tax regime.
Malta also has a regulator: the semi-autonomous Malta International Business
Authority (MIBA) seeks to ensure the smooth running of the offshore centre.
It has moral qualms: again and again Malta's politicians have insisted that
keeping the Catholic island clean and respectable is a primary
consideration.
Edwin Vella, a Maltese tax expert working for the local branch of Price
Waterhouse, said that MIBA in conjunction with the financial services sector
had the obligation of investigating businesses: 'We must know who they are
and why they're setting up here; we have to make sure they're not involved
in drugs and the mafia,' he said.
What Malta greatly wants is more banks. It has only four local operations:
the Mid-Med, the Lombard, the Bank of Valetta and the Investment Finance
Bank.
For some years now Malta has been advertising itself to the international
banking community. A recent 'Executive Summary,'produced by MIBA, promotes
Malta with the unquestionable simplicity necessary to appeal to top
international bankers: 'Wanted] Banking Institutions'.
More than half of Malta's investors are from Italy; the rest are sprinkled
around the world, from the US, Asia, west and east Europe, Scandinavia and
Australia.
'In common they have a desire to keep their affairs secret,' said Mr Vella,
adding cheerfully that a common reason they may put their money into Malta
was 'to avoid tax in their home country - that's the reason for the 700-800
holding companies'. Many of these companies hold royalty payments tax-free
for companies with industrial patents, wealthy artists, writers and sports
stars.
Unlike Malta, Cyprus and Madeira, enclaves such as Andorra, Campione and San
Marino are not trying to promote themselves as fully-fledged offshore
financial centres. They offer 'niche' services, such as property and
residence - or exist purely for leisure sports and gambling.
Monaco is in a slightly different league, offering banking and investment
services to a wealthier clientele of tax exiles; the Monagasque financial
centre is less dependent on fiscal nomads and expatriates than on the
international untaxed ranks of the supremely rich.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Offshore Centres
(4): Eyeing the mainstream - Luxembourg is seeking to diversify services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON GRAY

<TEXT>
FOR TWO decades Luxembourg has built up its financial sector by stealing
into niche markets ignored or disdained elsewhere. Now the emphasis is on
consolidation of a centre offering a broad range of services, one less
vulnerable to economic and regulatory developments beyond its control.
Although Luxembourg's activities remain heavily geared toward private
customer banking and investment funds, the principal engines of growth since
the mid-1980s, the authorities are seeking diversity in fields such as life
insurance and even financial spin-offs from the creation last year of the
landlocked Grand Duchy's commercial shipping register.
In spite of occasional denigration, mostly from outside observers, the
financial sector appears in healthy enough shape. After a poor year in 1990,
the banking sector's profits for last year are expected to show a healthy
rebound.
The sector now comprises 187 banks, some 70 of which have been established
over the past five years. Alongside them have growth up around 900
investment funds, for which the Grand Duchy has now become the leading
European centre.
'If you look at the most recent developments, one can only be satisfied,'
says Pierre Jaans, director-general of the banking sector's regulatory body,
the Luxembourg Monetary Institute (IML).
Not least, he says, the 1991 results will show the fruit of cost-cutting
policies by many banks, with a brake on the hiring of new employees
following several years of breakneck expansion. And as a bonus, Luxembourg's
overheated commercial property market has also cooled off, bringing down
city centre rents by anything up to a third.
Mr Jaans believes that Luxembourg's cost structure now looks much more
competitive in international terms than a year or so ago. 'Once you have
acquired a reputation for being expensive, it is virtually impossible to get
rid of it,' he says. 'It is very important not to cross the threshold.'
But he acknowledges that this is no time for the Grand Duchy's financial
industry to rest on its laurels. With increased competition from new centres
within and outside the European Community and policy change in neighbouring
countries, many of the advantages Luxembourg offers, particularly to the
private investor, are no longer unique.
This reflects to some extent the country's success in staving off pressure
from its EC partners for changes to a structure best known abroad for
banking secrecy (enforced by penalties for violators of up to two years'
imprisonment) and freedom of taxation for non-resident investors.
As a result, the private banking business has drawn fire from neighbouring
countries, especially France and at times Germany, because it not only
attracts savings from those countries but shields them from tax authorities.
The point is a very sore one. Insistent if unconfirmed reports say Paris has
in the past gone as far as to plant spies inside French-owned banks in the
Grand Duchy to report on the dealings of French customers; and that German
tax officials noted the numbers of German-registered cars parked near the
main cluster of banks in the city centre.
In spite of efforts to deflect criticism such as persuading banks to tone
down their advertising abroad, at one point in the late 1980s it looked as
though Luxembourg might have to accept dilution of its secrecy rules, a
paneuropean withholding tax on investment income or both.
The heat now seems to be off. The plan for an EC withholding tax died when
Germany abandoned its own tax, and Mr Jaans does not believe it will be
resuscitated even though the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe has ordered
the German government to reintroduce a withholding tax.
He says: 'Luxembourg has been singled out for its banking secrecy and its
tax-exempt status for non-residents. Now German officials are stressing that
their withholding tax package includes safeguards for the integrity of
banking secrecy in Germany and exempt status for non-residents. I would say
we are in good company.'
Since the debate was at its height in 1988, he says, other countries have
largely given up trying to change Luxembourg's rules in favour of copying
them. For instance, two years ago Belgium cut its own withholding tax from
25 to 10 per cent, seeking to persuade investors to keep their money at home
rather than make the short journey across the border to Luxembourg.
Luxembourg bankers say there has been no real indication that the 'Belgian
dentist', the archetypical private investor, is removing his money from the
Grand Duchy as a result. But it is a sign that other countries which
disdained such business are now doing their best to attract it.
And while Luxembourg has kept enemies of banking secrecy at bay with the
introduction of tough legislation against money laundering and insider
trading, bankers are now wondering whether the result, ironically, has been
to weaken secrecy rather than strengthen it.
A complaint that various banks had breached the secrecy rules was lodged in
January by Franklin Jurado, a Colombian who is on trial in the first
prosecution to be launched under the money laundering legislation. His claim
that the banks approached police investigators with informatIon about his
dealings is supported by evidence given during the trial.
Observers believe that bankers, confronted with the secrecy rules and
legislation making them criminally liable for 'negligent' involvement in
laundering, have concluded it is less risky to err on the side of
disclosure.
The dilemma will be removed by new legislation being prepared by the
government to implement common EC rules; this will free bankers offering
information on suspected money laundering from the strictures of the secrecy
requirements.
What it does leave open to question is the extent to which client
confidentiality will still exist - especially once another draft law
covering fiscal fraud is brought on to the statute book. The proposals,
which distinguish between petty tax evasion and large-scale fraud, were
published more than a year ago but enacting them does not appear to be a
government priority.
Bankers and regulators alike argue that banking secrecy is likely to be
eroded with time come what may, and that this will not be a disaster if
Luxembourg's financial sector can compensate with an enhanced degree of
competitiveness, expertise and customer service.
This has prompted the banks' drive for rationalisation and efficiency as
well as a new emphasis on training. Through its affiliate, the Luxembourg
Institute for Training in Banking, the Luxembourg Bankers' Association aims
to develop a cadre of specialist and generalist professionals capable of
competing with the best abroad.
While Mr Jaans believes that the number of investment funds registered in
Luxembourg is likely to stabilise around the 1,000 mark, he sees the
sector's growing expertise as a marketable asset, arguing that in the future
Luxembourg banks involved in Undertakings for Collective Investment in
Transferable Securities (Ucits) administration could offer services such as
custodianship to funds incorporated under French, Belgian and other
legislations.
And the authorities see a third pillar for the financial industry in the
increasing use of life insurance in the form of savings. With full
cross-border harmonisation still to come, the Luxembourg sector is still at
the fledgling stage, with some 10 companies established (although buyers are
sought for two of them).
All this suggests that Luxembourg may in the future move from the
traditional offshore niche role closer toward the mainstream, and that
competitiveness will be more than ever the watchword.

(3): Legislators update the rules - The Channel Islands' sound regulatory
framework is based on strict licensing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FAITH GLASGOW and PAUL HAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANNEL Islands are fond of pointing out that they turned down the Bank
of Credit and Commerce International's application to open an office.
It was one instance of their regulatory framework not only working, but
actually improving on the regulations in mainland Britain.
They have built up a sound regulatory framework over the past decade, based
on a strict licensing system. John Roper, director general of the Guernsey
Financial Services Commission (FSC), sums it up: 'We control the formation
of all Guernsey companies. Each one has to apply through the advocate's
office.'
A similar system of authorisation applies in Jersey, which updated its
existing legislation last October with the Banking Business (Jersey) Law
1991. This replaces the Depositors and Investors (Prevention of Fraud) Law
of 1967, and has been designed along the lines of the UK's Banking Act 1987
to bring the island into line with international standards.
Guernsey, too, is introducing legislation to update its current banking law.
Unlike Jersey, it is moving away from annual registration, partly because of
the amount of paperwork involved. A draft is expected before the end of this
year.
So far, the Channel Islands have not joined the bandwagon, taking the view
that it is preferable to play host only to top-drawer international
institutions in the first place.
However, Colin Powell, the Jersey government's economic adviser, comments
that 'if deposit protection schemes become a symbol of international
regulatory probity, then the island may well need to follow suit.'
Jersey is also introducing new regulations on companies coming to the
island, with a comprehensive new Company Law being brought into effect at
the end of March.
The legislation provides a framework for both starting up new companies and
dissolving, winding up or amalgamating existing ones; it abolishes the
doctrine of ultra vires, crystallises the responsibilities of directors, and
gives parameters for investigation and inspection of companies.
Trust formation is another area potentially open to abuse by unscrupulous
elements, although the Channel Islands' longstanding tough admission policy
for new businesses has helped in this respect. In order to set up or
administer trusts, a trust licence must be obtained from the authorities,
although there is currently no system of legislation requiring subsequent
monitoring by them once the business is actually in operation.
However, in Jersey, Colin Powell reports that the legislation currently in
the pipeline to regulate the provision of financial services will cover
trust and company administration. The aim will be for a renewable annual
licence to enable a regular check to be made.
Guernsey is also considering extending statutory regulation to 'fiduciaries'
 -a collective term that will embrace trust companies as well as a range of
other institutions managing customers' assets. But it is not looking at the
licensing system favoured by Jersey.
Belts are tightest as a result of the recession among the islands' fund
managers. But 'hard times' is a relative term: total assets under management
in Jersey rose to Pounds 7.3bn in September, from a nadir of Pounds 5.3bn
the previous year.
Guernsey, meanwhile, reports a 2.2 per cent increase in total asset value,
bringing it up to almost Pounds 6bn in September 1991.
Both islands report a move away from retail funds, where new competitors
have emerged in the shape of Dublin and Luxembourg touting their European
access advantages. As Colin Powell admits: 'Those inside Europe do have an
advantage for retail funds .'
That sentiment has been shared by some fund companies. Warburg and Fidelity
took their retail funds to Luxembourg in 1990; Flemings followed suit in
November 1991; Wardley moved the whole management operation over there.
But wholesale emigration has not been a widespread reaction to the challenge
presented by the European market. Some companies are working on joint
ventures to sell through local banks in certain countries such as Spain and
Portugal. And the authorities are themselves making approaches to EC member
states, including Belgium, Spain and Denmark.
A generally encouraging response from the various countries so far means
that it's likely that companies will be able to gain authorisation to market
retail funds direct to the public, on a fund-by-fund basis.
While it has not been an easy market worldwide - David Clifford, of Invesco
MIM, says it is simply harder to get customers to invest in funds - few of
the islands' investment managers are deeply pessimistic.
Jeffery Burton, managing director of Guernsey International Fund Managers,
insists that 'it would be wrong to give an impression of gloom and
despondency.'
Val Goodwin, at Rothschild Asset Management, says that 'it has generally
been the unit trust-driven fund managers who have had the biggest problems.
We have not had the same difficulties, because our money funds have done
very well and even increased in size over the past year (Dollars 1.2bn,
compared with Dollars 1bn in October 1990).'
Guinness Flight, which is also particularly strong on currency expertise,
has had a successful year, too. The director of the Guernsey operation,
Bruce Riley, believes the key in this respect is 'to invest in the markets
you're keen on and in the currency that's performing well.'
The company has been marketing energetically into the Middle and Far East in
particular, and reckons 'there is still a lot of world apart from Europe'.
Mr Riley attributes much of the company's impressive growth (60 per cent
from September 1990 to December 1991 in both of its umbrella funds) to its
marketing drive in these areas. 'All that comes to those who wait is old
age,' he observed bullishly. Following this philosophy, the company has also
linked up with a US-based company which is selling their products to
expatriates in the States.
Geographical specialisation has grown up over the years for many of the
major firms - Kleinwort Benson is strong in southern and eastern Africa, for
example, and Jersey-based Ashburton also has plentiful African contacts;
David Hall, at Coutts in Jersey, highlights Israel as 'a good source of
business'.
But, as Jeffery Burton points out, 'many of us are broadening our areas of
operation around the world.'
One of the most often mentioned regions, in terms of potential, is the Far
East, with an increasing number of Channel Island-base offices or
representatives being established there.
One significant development for the Channel Islands in 1991, with regard to
possible new markets, was the agreement reached with the Japanese
authorities, to the effect that Jersey and Guernsey SIB-recognised funds can
be marketed to Japanese investors in Japan.
This does not mean that the Japanese market will be cracked overnight.
Retail funds especially are expected to take some time to get off the
ground, given the challenge of practicalities such as the language barrier
and the fact that the Japanese public are likely to be largely unfamiliar
with the islands' reputation.

(5): Plenty of space for expansion - Sue Stuart investigates facilities on
the Isle of Man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Isle of Man's financial services sector continues to expand and develop.
It produces more than 30 per cent of the Manx gross national product (GNP)
compared to 21 per cent 10 years ago.
For companies and institutions seeking an offshore base close to the UK the
Isle of Man has a significant advantage - it still has lots of space.
The island's 220 square miles contain only 70,000 people, about half of whom
live in or close to Douglas. There are large tracts of land uninhabited. The
commercial property market is healthy and purpose-built offices in new
developments can be rented for around Pounds 14 per square foot.
No restrictions are placed on the size of businesses and this has led some
institutions and firms to locate there rather than the Channel Islands where
physical expansion is very difficult. But the Manx authorities do closely
examine the quality and reputation of any company wishing to set up. A work
permit is needed for employees moving to the island and for their first five
years residency. The island's scenic beauty, low crime rate and good
education and health services make it a pleasant place to live so businesses
can attract high calibre personnel. The finance sector employs more than
4,000 people, 14 per cent of the island's available workforce.
However, the finance community feels visiting business men or women do not
fare so well. Apart from the Heathrow daily route, air services to the
island are generally considered infrequent and inconveniently timed. Air
fares are also higher than on most UK routes. There is no first class hotel
and though service in hotels and restaurants comes with a smile, seasoned
travellers find it slow and often poor. Another plus for the Isle of Man is
its standards of regulation of financial services. Though most islanders
cringe at the mention of the Savings and Investment Bank crash of 1982,
there is little doubt this disaster created an awareness of the need for
sound regulation and supervision.
In 1983, the Financial Supervision Commission was created. Since its
inception it has doggedly pursued a policy of instituting regulation that
offers the best protection to the investor, while not proving too onerous
for the practitioner.
The FSC's abilities were well proven by the collapse of BCCI, which had a
branch in the island.
In February 1991 the Isle of Man instituted a depositor protection scheme,
little realising how soon after it would be utilised. In the event of a
participating bank's failure each of the other participating banks, at
present 51, is liable to pay to the fund one eighth of 1 per cent of its
deposit liabilities. A minimum payment of Pounds 25,000 and a maximum of
Pounds 250,000 have been set for any one year. When the Bank of England
ordered the closure of BCCI branches the scheme swung into action and is
expected to fund about Pounds 22m over the next three years.
While proud of its regulation and supervision, the island is far from
complacent in its attitude to new business. The decline of tourism and
agriculture as contributors to the GNP means financial services and
manufacturing need to be strengthened to ensure economic viability for the
island. The single European market is not regarded as a threat because the
Manx client base is worldwide.
There are 11 life assurance companies based in the island with products
mostly tailored to meet the needs of expatriates of various nationalities.
Their main markets are the Middle and Far East. But the high net worth
individual and the international investor are now also targeted in a new
range of products. Captive insurance continues to grow and 112 captives are
registered in the Isle of Man. Among these is Northern Shipping Insurance of
Arkhangelsk in Russia, the first captive to come out of the eastern bloc.
Businesses feel the break-up of the Soviet Union will lead to more financial
business coming to the west from that area.
Ship registration is also on the increase. Five years ago there were 76
ships registered in the island and eight marine administration companies.
Now there are 128 ships and 23 companies.
Trust and company formation has always been the backbone of offshore tax
planning and was traditionally handled by lawyers and accountants. As the
volume of work increased banks and other professionals set up specialist
companies to deal with it. There are now 32 trust administration companies
in the island.
The Manx government led the way among offshore jurisdictions when it
announced last year plans to legislate for the regulation of company
formation businesses. It is a complex field involving high levels of
confidentiality and it appears the most likely route taken will be to
license practitioners and apply a code of conduct. A further incentive was
added for fund managers at the end of last year. From April 6, 1992 resident
fund managers will have tax payable on their annual fee income reduced from
20 per cent to 5 per cent. Initially this tax break will extend until 2005.

(1): Outsiders come first in financial markets - An offshore financial
centre must have paradoxical characteristics. It must be respectable but
accommodating. It must be European, but preferably just outside Europe.
Those centres that succeed in the delicate balancing act will prosper
</HEADLINE>

SOMETIMES IT is outsiders, rather than insiders, that can have the edge in
the financial markets.
At the beginning of next year the European Community is scheduled to open
its much-ballyhooed Single Market. One of the most important areas for this
initiative is financial services, the subject of a large number of
directives in banking, insurance, investment and so forth.
But there is a possibility that not only the financial industry within the
EC will benefit from these initiatives. Dotted around the edge of the
community, and to some extent also in pockets within it, are a number of
so-called offshore financial centres. Many of these are hoping that they may
benefit in some way from upheavals in the mainland financial sector.
One of the biggest challenges arises from the possibility that Switzerland,
the most prestigious of all the 'offshore' financial centres within the
European time zone, is likely to move into a closer relationship with the
European Community, and may even become a full member within the foreseeable
future.
Will this mean that Switzerland's key private banking centres of Geneva and
Zurich, along with other EC centres such as Luxembourg and London, will
become buried in Community regulations and infested with tax burdens? If so,
a lot of money will leave in search of more tolerant and discreet
jurisdictions.
Or will the EC's regime be light and flexible? So far, for instance,
Luxembourg has been able to maintain a successful role as the Community's
onshore/offshore centre. It has been able to fight off the threat of a
Community-wide withholding tax. It is far from clear, however, that it will
be able to sustain all its advantages in the long run. Little Luxembourg has
been able to argue that it needs special privileges to offset its lack of
basic economic resources. But the entry of Switzerland to the EC might force
the playing field to be levelled.
Small jurisdictions such as Luxembourg have the advantage of flexibility.
Luxembourg has, for example, managed to grab for itself the position of
focus of the EC-wide mutual funds industry which has been made possible as a
result of an earlier directive on Undertakings for Collective Investment in
Transferable Securities (Ucits).
Although the Grand Duchy has little in the way of tradition as an investment
centre, it has set up an attractive fiscal regime for mutual funds. Bigger
countries such as the UK have much greater resources and experience in the
field, but their tax authorities and regulators are obsessed with domestic
considerations.
Foreign buyers of British mutual funds, or unit trusts as they are called,
must try to recover tax which is deducted at source from dividends. Although
this may theoretically be possible, few such international investors can be
bothered to grapple with Britain's tax bureaucracy. They buy tax-free funds
from Luxembourg or other jurisdictions instead.
Only one other substantial mainland jurisdiction within the EC has seriously
gone after international business. The Irish government has backed the
Dublin International Financial Services Centre, a low tax base for
international financial services companies. It has become a significant
rival to Luxembourg in some areas such as mutual funds and offshore
insurance companies.
Otherwise, Gibraltar and Madeira also count as integral zones of the
European Community, though they are politically subordinate to the UK and
Portugal respectively.
There are bigger offshore centres outside the EC, however.
The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man have a special position established
under a protocol to the Treaty of Rome. For the purposes of their financial
services activities they are outside the Community, although their physical
goods trade is within the common tariff barrier.
At one stage they were concerned at the negative impact the Single Market
might have on them, but now they are developing a positive strategy as
'offshore Europe' centres. Significantly, a strong link is being built up
between Switzerland and Jersey and Guernsey as the Swiss banks hedge their
bets. It is no coincidence that Crossair, the Swiss airline, has recently
increased its flights between Zurich and the Channel Islands to daily
frequency.
If the EC centres become highly constrained by Single Market rules there
could be much more scope for the external centres to attract business. The
Channel Islands are easily reached from many European countries and are
within the European time zone, although they have yet to develop the
multilingual capability which Switzerland provides.
But could the Channel Islands nevertheless be too close for some purposes?
Might they, for instance, come under pressure to disclose confidential
client information to mainland tax authorities? The provocative question is
raised in a far from disinterested manner by offshore bankers in places such
as Bermuda and even parts of the Caribbean.
They have focused much of their attention on the western hemisphere in the
past, but are now floating the idea that places such as Bermuda could be
attractive centres for Europeans who would like their money to be a safe
distance away from Europe.
It depends, of course, on how much the clients have to hide. Offshore
centres have always played down the idea that their clients are corrupt
Third World dictators who have looted their national treasuries or drug
barons trying to launder dirty money. Under pressure from the US
authorities, jurisdictions such as Switzerland have already been forced to
abandon much of their tradition of banking secrecy.
There remains, however, the likelihood that many clients are evading taxes
in their domestic jurisdictions. Belgian dentists do not, it can be assumed,
normally declare their Eurobond interest income to the tax man.
The growth in expatriate employment has also created a big market for the
preservation of wealth in safe, efficient centres where it is secure not
only from tax demands but also from acquisitive ex-wives and feuding
relatives. Offshore financial centres offer confidentiality and privacy
(although whether they can always deliver it is not so clear).
There has always also been a substantial business in offering offshore
services to companies, especially in the creation of complex structures
which enable taxes to be avoided or deferred.
Secrecy privileges may also make it possible for the ownership of corporate
entities to be cloaked in obscurity. This was a notorious feature of the
Robert Maxwell empire, for example, with controlling interests held through
jurisdictions such as Liechtenstein and Gibraltar.
The brass plate industry continues to maintain many offshore lawyers in
comfortable employment. But it is private banking that provides the real
growth element for most offshore centres at present.
New contenders are attempting to break into this lucrative business, and
they may see greater scope if existing centres are increasingly handicapped
by European Community regulations. In the Mediterranean, Malta and Cyprus
are seeking to expand within a market place which could take in parts of the
Middle East as well as southern Europe.
There is also the possibility that offshore-type centres might be created in
parts of eastern Europe. Hungary, for example, has been offering attractive
financial services to international clients.
Offshore centres do not necessarily need the backing of a long tradition -
the Channel Islands themselves have been serious offshore financial centres
for only about 25 years - but they do need political and financial
stability. Clients are scarcely likely to express confidence in a place
threatened by revolution or invasion.
Gibraltar, for example, would have a much greater opportunity for growth if
only the political row with Spain could be patched up. And even
Switzerland's image has been damaged just a little bit in offshore eyes by
the political and economic weaknesses which have undermined the Swiss franc
and have led to the flirtation with the EC by a country which previously has
always been resolutely independent.
An offshore financial centre must have paradoxical characteristics. It must
be respectable but accommodating. It must be European, but preferably just
outside Europe. Those centres that succeed in the delicate balancing act
will prosper.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Offshore Centres
(2): Adapting to modern demands - Ian Rodger compares regulations in
Switzerland and Liechtenstein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER

<TEXT>
FORGET the traditional image of Switzerland as a place where the nervous
rich can hide their money from snooping taxmen or other investigators.
The country's bankers, who manage nearly SFr2,000bn in private fortunes, are
in the midst of significant change to adapt themselves to the demands of a
new legal environment and of a new generation of high net worth customers.
Since last year, Swiss law obliges the country's bankers to know the
beneficial owner of every account they keep and to co-operate with domestic
and foreign authorities in criminal inquiries.
Liechtenstein, the tiny principality wedged between Austria and Switzerland,
still allows customers to hide behind lawyers or other intermediaries. But
the principality has shown in a number of investigations - the most recent
one being the Robert Maxwell case - that it is not willing to conceal
egregious criminality.
Moreover, both the Swiss and Liechtenstein banking communities suspect that
it is only a matter of time before they will have to conform with
pan-European practice, even in terms of sharing information with foreign tax
authorities.
When and if the two join the European Economic Area (EEA), they will have to
comply with the European Community directive prohibiting money laundering,
but both already try hard to steer away drug money. They have fought against
mutual assistance on tax matters and appear to have won a respite, at least
for the time being.
Even if Switzerland and Liechtenstein wanted to remain in splendid
isolation, it is doubtful that they could. The fund management business has
become global in its operations, and the leading Swiss and Liechtenstein
financial institutions all have substantial assets placed in financial
markets throughout the world. These are easy targets, as the US Securities
and Exchange Commission has shown, for pressuring institutions to co-operate
in criminal investigations.
All this does not mean that the Swiss and Liechtenstein private bankers are
about to roll over and die. On the contrary, they are working hard to retain
their competitiveness in an increasingly demanding environment.
Swiss banks are still undoubtedly the world market leaders in the business
of managing the fortunes of the rich. Mr Hans-Dieter Vontobel of Zurich's
Vontobel Bank has calculated on the basis of declared expenses that
Swiss-based banks manage some SFr1,800bn in assets, of which 70 per cent are
foreign owned.
This dominant position was built up through this century mainly as a result
of the country's image as a haven of political and currency stability in a
world frequently racked by wars. The former stiff bank secrecy provisions
enabled the world's rich to escape taxmen, families and various other
plaintiffs who laid claim to part or all of their fortunes.
Today, however, the environment has changed dramatically. The Swiss franc is
no longer obviously more stable than any of a dozen other currencies, and
tax evasion is no longer a prime concern of the new breed of rich.
The typical new clients today are entrepreneurs whose businesses have been
bought by big groups, high earning self-employed professionals or
well-educated young people who have inherited fortunes from less financially
sophisticated parents. 'Most of them can find adequate means of sheltering
themselves from tax in their own countries,' says Eduardo Leemann, senior
vice-president of Bank Julius Baer, one of the top Zurich banks.
Swiss bankers acknowledge that there is still a substantial clientele that
seeks secrecy for any of a number of reasons, but they just have to go
elsewhere. 'We carry out our policy as if there was no banking secrecy at
all,' a Credit Suisse spokesman says.
It is thought that hundreds of millions of dollars have fled Swiss banks for
Liechtenstein in the past two years since the introduction of the law
requiring a banker to know his client. Some may also have gone to Austrian
banks, which still allow anyone to open an anonymous numbered account.
But Swiss bankers say most clients are won and held today mainly on the
basis of fund management performance and service. Thus, they do not see
themselves as competing so much against other well known offshore centres,
such as the Channel Islands, Luxembourg, Gibraltar or the Isle of Man.
Rather, competition is against other banks specialised in private banking,
regardless of where they may be based.
They admit that their main competitive strength at the moment is service.
'The Swiss are absolute market leaders in delivery of fast and error-free
service,' says Mr Jean Pierre Cuoni, chief executive of Coutts &amp; Co, the
Zurich-based international private banking division of Britain's National
Westminster Bank.
Because of their long experience in dealing with a substantially
international clientele, the Swiss banks have staff even at a very junior
level who are comfortable handling transactions involving several
currencies, countries and types of financial instrument.
They also provide ancillary services, such as estate planning and insurance
selection, even helping sort out disputes within rich families. 'We are
stock brokers, portfolio managers, global custodians and private family
advisers,' says Jacques de Saussure, a partner in Geneva's Pictet &amp; Co, the
largest Swiss private bank.
By contrast, the typical branch of a typical German, Austrian, Spanish or
French bank is simply not ready for these demands, Swiss bankers say.
The Swiss also point to what might be called the amenities they offer for
the high net worth clientele. Geneva and Zurich, the two main private
banking centres, both offer excellent shopping, accommodation and medical
treatment facilities, and Switzerland has several delightful resorts where
they can rest and enjoy themselves.
Until recently, the Swiss franc was an important part of this amenity, but
it has lost some of its lustre of late. However, bankers are quick to point
out that its weakness is not an important element in the real business of
managing funds for top performance. 'If I have 25 per cent of even a Swiss
client's assets in Swiss francs, that is already too much,' says Mr Leemann.
Little is known about the international competitiveness of Swiss fund
management because up to now few statistics have been published, but it is
generally thought that it has not been sparkling. Bank Julius Baer will make
audited information on its institutional funds available this year for the
first time, and others will undoubtedly be forced to follow.

FT  28 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS reported a dull session in stock index futures, with disappointing
news from several leading companies taking centre stage, writes Joel Kibazo.
Independent traders sent the March contract forward early in the session,
and it soon recorded an 8-point advance to 2,590.
But a downbeat trading statement accompanying ICI's full-year figures,
together with the disappointing news of the collapse of merger talks between
British Airways and KLM, sent March into retreat.
A poor early Wall Street showing brought out more sellers, but independent
traders moving to cover short positions as March fell to 2,565 led to a
bounce before the close.
March closed at 2,573, down 11 on the previous session and around 3 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Volume reached
5,613 lots.
Turnover in traded options was a reasonable 31,157 contracts. Volume in the
FT-SE 100 index option at 7,429 lots was down ahead of its expiry today, but
satisfactory trading was seen in the stock options.
Tesco was the top stock option, recording a day's total of 1,873 lots. This
was followed by Midland Bank, which traded 1,643 contracts.

FT  28 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Royal hit hard by results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPOSITE insurer Royal Insurance plunged following results described
variously in the market as 'disastrous' and 'appalling'. The decision to
pass the final dividend hit hardest at a share price which dropped 49 at one
stage, although it recovered later to 190p, a final loss of 36 on the day.
Turnover was very heavy at 20m shares.
The group's executives also failed to turn in a convincing performance at
the post-results meeting with analysts. 'They did nothing to remove the
uncertainty surrounding future trading prospects, or to give any guidance on
dividend expectations,' said Mr Steven Bird at County NatWest.
Other analysts complained that the lack of information given at the meeting
meant that putting any value on the stock was extremely difficult.
Improvement in the group's US operations was more than offset by the
worsening situation in the UK insurance business. Many observers believe
that Royal will have to consider the sale or flotation of its life assurance
operation, which made profits of around Pounds 47m and is valued at some
Pounds 540m.
Analysts' forecasts for 1992 are mostly in the range of losses of Pounds
150m to Pounds 200m, with the group edging into profitability by 1993.
Worries about mortgage indemnity losses, borne out by Royal's results,
depressed the other composites. Commercial Union lost 8 to 458p, General
Accident 10 to 426p, Guardian Royal Exchange 9 to 110p, Sun Alliance 13 to
271p and BAT Industries, with its Eagle Star subsidiary, 11 to 649p.
Midland pleases
Surprise and relief greeted Midland Bank's small profit and its decision to
pay a final dividend. The shares gained 21 to 260p in very large turnover of
17m. The bank's cost control measures and the improvement in distributable
reserves pleased the market.
However, questions still remain over the bank's management of bad debts and
the level of provisions. 'I am concerned about the general quality of
Midland's loan portfolio and its judgment on provisions,' said Mr Tim Clarke
at Panmure Gordon. Yield worries were also voiced by a number of observers.
Mr Mike Fesemeyer at Nomura said: 'A current yield of 2.6 per cent puts the
share price under pressure and could threaten the dividend next year.'
For 1992, analysts' forecasts range from Pounds 200m to Pounds 280m, with
recovery in 1993 to the region of Pounds 500m to Pounds 580m.
BA above worst
The share price of British Airways was down 18p at one stage, after it
emerged - and was later confirmed by the company - that merger talks with
KLM, the Dutch airline, had been terminated.
The news led to heavy selling and turnover reached 8m shares by mid-morning.
Bargain hunters, however, came in at the lower levels, and dealers reported
good two-way business by the afternoon, helping the stock to recover some
ground to end 11 off at 265p after heavy volume of 17m.
Light US selling was noted and the American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) fell
by Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 46 3/8 in early trading.
Mr Clive Anderson, at Smith New Court, said: 'The prospects of the KLM deal
added froth to the share price. In the short term, the fundamentals are
encouraging, hence the recovery in the share price. However, in the long
term, there is a prospect of greater competition on the north Atlantic
routes.'
Miss Yasmin Harrison, at James Capel, added: 'It is a good thing that BA can
walk away from a deal it does not feel is right for shareholders.'
ICI results were in line with forecasts but the statement from chairman Sir
Denys Henderson steered analysts away from premature enthusiasm.
Most observers cut their estimates back after the meeting and the range of
profit forecasts widened as a result of diverging views regarding the
chances of a recovery in the global economy. Smith New Court moved its 1992
figure back by Pounds 50m to Pounds 950m but suggested the stock should be
bought on weakness. Nikko came back by Pounds 100m to Pounds 1bn and took a
more negative view on the shares, arguing that their rating, in 1993 terms,
was too demanding for a chemicals stock. ICI fell 23 to 1284p.
British Gas eased  1/2 to 258p as analysts suggested that while the results
were difficult to judge in view of the change in year-end to December from
March, the overall impression was disappointing.
Criticism over its drug pricing weighed on Glaxo again yesterday and the
shares weakened 20 to 774p on hefty turnover of 4.3m, following very busy
dealing in New York overnight where the equivalent of 8.6m shares were
traded.
News that the Danish Office of Fair Trading had asked the European
Commission to look into Glaxo's pricing reached the London market late on
Wednesday afternoon, when marketmakers had only a short time to react.
However, some felt the reaction was overdone. Mr Andrew Porter of Nikko
Securities said: 'In the recent six-month figures only 1 per cent of the
growth was the result of price increases. This is an industry-wide issue and
it is unfair to single Glaxo out.' Nikko is a strong buyer and believes the
shares will touch Pounds 10 by the end of the year.
Fisons moved ahead 9 to 389p on renewed talk that a bid might emerge soon
for the healthcare group. Almost every company with a vague link has been
cited.
Good two-way business in British Telecom saw 13m traded in the partly-paid
shares, the price edging up 1 1/4 to 122 3/4 p. Cable and Wireless rose 10
to 603p as recent buy notes from a couple of brokers and a series of
presentations over the past week by Charterhouse Tilney lifted the stock.
An upbeat trend was maintained by BP, following recent optimistic comments
from New York. The stock put on 2 1/2 to 267p on reduced, but still strong,
turnover of 18m shares.
The depressed construction sector saw a ray of hope in Alfred McAlpine's
forecast that full results for the current financial year will show a modest
improvement over 1991. The shares advanced 12 to 205p in spite of a warning
that the first half is likely to be poor.
The appointment of Mr Tim Howden as chief executive Europe for Albert Fisher
lifted the stock 3 to 65p. Ranks Hovis McDougall, where Mr Howden is
currently managing director, relinquished 7 to 207p.
A buy recommendation for Iceland from BZW pushed the shares up 16 to 454p.
Mr Bill Currie, at BZW, said: 'We think trading is extremely buoyant and the
figures (for 1991) will be good.' BZW is forecasting Pounds 46.5m, against
Pounds 40.35m previously.
Brewer Allied-Lyons gained 4 to 637p in a generally firm sector. Allied has
sold its brandy and distribution interests in Spain to the privately-owned
Pedro Domecq for Pounds 50m.
Full-year results from Courtaulds Textiles pleased the market and the shares
continued recent strength to set an all-time high of 463p, up 19 on turnover
of 1.1m. SG Warburg, the company's broker, increased its 1992 profits
estimate by Pounds 3m to Pounds 48m.
Reappraisal of potential BSkyB profits was said to be behind another strong
performance from Pearson, which rose 6 to 813p, a 2 1/2 -year high. One
analyst argued that, assuming the satellite television channel is floated,
Pearson's 16 per cent stake will translate into some Pounds 400m, which
compares very favourably with the Pounds 107m the publisher invested.
The market once again took a somewhat negative view of the way Williams
Holdings reports its accounts and the shares fell 12 to 313p in spite of
news of full-year figures in line with market forecasts.
The prospect of a better outlook following the current analysts' visit to
British Aerospace lifted the stock 12 to 308p, while a squeeze in Siebe saw
the shares add 14 at 394p.

FT  28 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities recover from brief setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUCCESSFUL defensive session in the UK stock market yesterday saw share
prices hold steady in the face of a substantial widening of the monthly
trade deficit and another round of generally bearish trading announcements
from leading British companies.
Some encouragement was drawn from a maintained dividend payment from Midland
Bank, but both ICI and Royal Insurance fell on their respective results and
the market reacted negatively to the unexpected news that British Airways'
hopes of a merger with KLM, of the Netherlands, have collapsed.
The stock market was jolted at midsession by the announcement that the
monthly current account deficit on UK trade had increased dramatically to
Pounds 794m in January. But a steady performance by sterling and the UK bond
market soothed any fears in equities that the widely expected base rate cut
might be in jeopardy.
The FT-SE Index closed 3.0 down at 2,562.0, having moved erratically between
2,572 and 2,555 during the session. Stock index futures played a less
significant role in the underlying stock market than recently and market
indices were often distorted by movements in the blue chip companies
announcing results yesterday.
Price movements in ICI, Royal Insurance and British Airways represented a
fall of around 2.75 points on the Footsie index, but were partly balanced by
the advance by Midland Bank, worth about 1.1.
Seaq volume increased to 606.1m shares from the 548.6m of the previous
session. The trading focus on ICI, Midland, BP, British Airways and other
stocks favoured by the fund managers was believed to have inflated retail,
or customer, business again yesterday; on Wednesday, retail business in
equities totalled Pounds 972m, a relatively high level.
The advance of 25 Dow points on Wall Street overnight had little effect on a
London market now firmly geared to the prospect of a positive Budget speech
by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, a week on Tuesday,
with a reduction of at least half a point off UK base rates closely linked
to it.
With the electoral prospects of the Conservative government still uncertain,
share prices opened sluggishly before responding favourably to the news that
Midland Bank had beaten market forecasts by reporting a small profit and a
final dividend payment.
However, a gain of seven points, taking the Footsie to the day's peak, was
soon trimmed as investors reacted to a substantial loss at Royal Insurance
and a discouraging trading statement from ICI as it disclosed the expected
fall in annual profits.
Although the retail and consumer-orientated sectors continued to display
optimism for the expected reduction in UK base rates, the wider range of
domestic equities lacked enthusiasm.
Insurance stocks were depressed by Royal's trading figures, while among the
pharmaceuticals, Glaxo lost further ground as Denmark brought the group's
drug prices before the European Commission.
However, with US buyers still sustaining the BP share price in late
dealings, the blue chip international stocks held steady and the London
market was left to await publication of the next poll of political opinion
in the UK, which is expected at the weekend.

FT  28 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falls on profit-taking
and rise in jobless data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US EQUITIES retreated yesterday on sporadic profit-taking and disappointment
about a rise in weekly unemployment claims, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.87 down at 3,269.45, having
spent the day in negative territory, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped
1.49 to 413.86. The Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, however,
bucked the trend. Building on Wednesday's sharp gain, the index added 1.55
at 633.95. Turnover on the New York SE came to 215m shares.
The only economic news of the day was broadly bearish, with the Labor
Department reporting that an extra 7,000 people had filed claims for state
unemployment insurance during the second week of the month. The figures make
it more likely that the February employment report, due out on March 6, will
show a further deterioration in job market conditions.
Warner-Lambert dropped Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 64 3/4 in turnover of 3.8m
shares on news that the US Food and Drug Administration had raised questions
that could delay marketing approval for the company's Lopid SR drug, which
is used to regulate cholesterol.
The ADRs of UK drugs group Glaxo were heavily traded for the second
consecutive day, shedding a further Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 28 1/8 in volume
of 4.4m. Glaxo has been in the news in Europe, after Denmark's Office of
Fair Trading said it was requesting the European Commission to investigate
the company's pricing policies.
Philips jumped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 20 3/8 in busy trading after the
Dutch group turned a big 1990 loss into a healthy profit for 1991.
Trading in Conagra shares was delayed during the morning because of an order
imbalance on the sell side, sparked by news that the stock had been
downgraded by Goldman Sachs. When trading reopened, Conagra fell Dollars 2
5/8 to Dollars 27 7/8 .
Chemical Waste Management put on Dollars 1 to Dollars 20 7/8 after Morgan
Stanley upgraded the stock from a 'hold' to a 'buy', arguing that the
shares, currently trading at a 15 per cent premium to the market, are
undervalued based on earnings projections.
On the over-the-counter market, Vitesse Semiconductor climbed Dollars 3 1/4
to Dollars 20 after the company backed market estimates that its
second-quarter earnings would reach 7 cents a share, a big improvement on
the previous year's quarter.
US Bancorp rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 23 after the regional banking group
agreed to buy 49 branches in northern California and Nevada from BankAmerica
(up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 43 7/8 ) and Security Pacific (Dollars  1/2
firmer at Dollars 36 5/8 ) for Dollars 70m.
Canada
THE Toronto market ended little changed as gains in gold shares countered
losses in the metals and minerals sector. Most other groups were steady.
Analysts said the market was digesting Wednesday's 35-point upturn in the
composite index following the release of the Federal Budget.
The index closed just 3.6 firmer at 3,584.1. Rises led declines by 331 to
235 after volume of 33m shares.
Toronto-Dominion Bank dipped CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 17 after lower
first-quarter earnings.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar drops back from highs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR took a rest from attacking the DM1.66 barrier yesterday, falling
below DM1.64 before floating back towards its starting level.
'It has not been exactly an exciting market,' said one dealer. 'Most
movement has been to bring the dollar down.'
The US unit drifted below DM1.64 at midsession as traders tried to flush out
some of the longer-term fund buyers they believe to be lurking in the
market.
Confidence in the dollar also faltered following disappointing US weekly
first-time jobless claims (up to 459,000 from 452,000 the previous week,
against market expectations of a 2,000 decline) and the news that January
existing home sales fell 1.5 per cent.
In New York, the dollar opened  3/4 pfennig lower than Wednesday's close of
DM1.6458, and a subsequent rally faded to leave a DM1.6355 finish.
The dollar was slightly quieter against the yen, following heavy
profit-taking above Y130 in recent days and repeated threats of intervention
in Japanese quarters. The intervention hype was maintained yesterday with
finance minister Mr Tsutomu Hata saying his country wanted to reconfirm that
the G7 nations still favour a stronger yen. He added that if the G7 deputy
finance ministers meet today, as reported, they will discuss currencies.
In Tokyo, the US currency had been steady to weaker in late trading, closing
at Y129.01/06, compared with a previous close of Y129.20/30. One dealer
called it the 'Tokyo blues - top-heavy and bottom-solid.'
After steady gains in recent days and its climb to Y130 on Wednesday,
dealers said the dollar was now in a corrective consolidation phase. It
moved in a narrow range in Europe to close at Y129.40, compared with Y129.65
on Wednesday. In New York the dollar ended easier at Y129.15.
The D-Mark held steady after overnight weakness in the dollar gave it a
gentle lift, and it closed up slightly against the lira and the French
franc.
Profit-taking took the peseta off its permitted ceiling against sterling,
and it declined to 5.89 per cent above its pivot against sterling, down from
6.19 per cent on Wednesday night.
It moved off its ceiling of Pta180.59, where it has been for most of the
week, to Pta181.00/10. Traders said the Bank of Spain's 25 basis points rate
cut on Tuesday had finally triggered unwinding of long positions, but the
light reprieve was seen as unlikely to change the timetable for a cut in UK
interest rates
The market seemed unconcerned with poor UK trade deficit figures. 'Frankly
they are irrelevant,' one dealer said. 'We are more interested now in
political indicators.'
Sterling performed strongly against the dollar, opening at Dollars 1.7537,
after a previous close of Dollars 1.7450, and climbing to Dollars 1.7642
before a late slip back to Dollars 1.7550. In New York it improved to
Dollars 1.7640. The pound edged up against the D-Mark in London to DM2.8867
from Wednesday's DM2.8854 finish.

FALCONBRIDGE of Canada is to restart the number one smelter at Falconbridge
Dominicana, its ferro-nickel facility in the Dominican Republic, in
mid-March, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. The smelter was closed last
October because of the weak state of the nickel market. Falcondo has an
annual capacity of 32,000 tonnes of ferro-nickel. The closure of the smelter
cut production by half.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Britain's zinc production
industry put up for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK'S zinc production industry, which has a turnover of Pounds 150m and
employs about 850 people, was put up for sale yesterday when Pasminco of
Australia announced it hoped to dispose of its European assets. These
include the Avonmouth smelter in the west of the UK, the only domestic
source and main supplier of refined zinc in Britain. Pasminco recently
completed a Pounds 10m expansion at the smelter, taking its annual capacity
to 105,000 tonnes of zinc and 50,000 tonnes of lead bullion.
Pasminco also owns three companies at Bloxwich in the West Midlands that
make a number of zinc alloy products and take in the Impalloy division,
Europe's leading supplier of zinc protectors for cathodes.
Analysts suggested that Pasminco should have no difficulty selling the UK
assets, which have improved significantly in the past few years, but said
there were substantial question marks over its other European asset - a 50
per cent shareholding in a 200,000-tonnes-a-year zinc refinery at Budel in
the Netherlands.
Budelco, which is jointly owned with Billiton, the mining and metals arm of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group, is one of the world's biggest and most
cost-competitive electrolytic zinc smelters. However, the management has
given itself until the middle of this year to decide whether to invest about
Fl 300m (Pounds 90) on plant to reprocess waste material or to close down.
The smelter will no longer be able to store jarosite, an iron-bearing waste
product from electrolytic smelting, from 1995. More than 600 are employed at
the smelter, on the Belgian-Dutch border, and discussions have been going on
with the Dutch authorities about its future.
Budelco identified a technology for processing the jarosite into an inert
slag suitable for use in the construction industry but said the tight
environmental conditions required by the Dutch authorities would make it
'financially unattractive'.
Pasminco, which was formed in 1988 when North Broken Hill Peko and CRA
pooled their zinc and lead interests, announced it intended to sell its
European assets to reduce debt and to concentrate on its Australian
interests after revealing a net loss of ADollars 118m, including abnormal
and extraordinary losses. Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, is advising
on the divestment programme.
Analysts said there were no obvious buyers for the European assets although
the Marc Rich international commodity trading organisation based in Zug,
Switzerland, might be interested, as well as Japanese groups such as Mitsui,
which already has zinc smelting expertise, and Sumitomo. Germany's
Metallgesellschaft, which seems likely to close its Meggen zinc smelter
soon, was another company mentioned as a possible buyer.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian platinum sales cut
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN PLATINUM sales to the west are likely to fall by more than 40 per
cent this year, from about 950,000 troy ounces in 1991 to about 650,000
ounces, suggests Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at the Williams de Broe
financial services group.
She points out in a special report on the platinum market that the level of
Russian sales constitutes 'one of the most interesting and most sensitive
areas of the whole picture this year'.
Sales from the former Soviet Union - 90 per cent from the Norilsk smelters
in Russia - last year are thought to have been between 900,000 and 1m
ounces. This is separate from the estimated 700,000 ounces that found their
way to Switzerland either on swap (where metal is sold with a promise to buy
it back at an agreed future date and price) or on lease.
Ms O'Connell suggests it is reasonable to assume that the swaps have been
unwound and the metal returned to Russia. In that case, Russia will be able
to supply relatively high contracted sales to Japan this year (about 500,000
ounces) and also sell spot metal 'more or less at will'.
However, it is also reasonable to assume that Norilsk's platinum production
will fall by at least 10 per cent in 1992.
Consequently, 'it seems feasible that the Commonwealth of Independent States
will be able to supply platinum into the west at a higher rate than the
historical average, drawing if necessary on stocks taken back from the
unwinding of swaps.
However, it is questionable whether these higher swap levels can be
continued into 1993.
In her 'most likely case,' Ms O'Connell sees platinum mine production up
from 3.292m ounces last year to 3.529m in 1992 while total supply is
expected to fall slightly, because of lower Russian sales, from 4.467m to
4.449m ounces.
Offtake is forecast to rise from 3.872m to 4.029m ounces, which, after
changes in terminal market stocks, should leave 420,000 ounces (565,000
ounces) for investment.
Ms O'Connell expects platinum's price in 1992 to range between Dollars 330
and Dollars 400 an ounce, with an average of Dollars 365.

FT  28 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Radical rejig for Swiss
capital structures - Ian Rodger on changes in company law aimed at giving
shareholders a fairer deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS the annual round of press conferences by big Swiss companies begins this
week, the focus in many cases will not be so much on the companies' 1991
financial results as on their plans to overhaul their share structures.
This is because of radical revisions in Swiss company law which come into
effect on July 1 and which oblige quoted Swiss companies to be more
transparent about their businesses and to bring their treatment of
shareholders more in line with accepted international practice.
From now on, for example, all groups must present consolidated financial
accounts. Also, fund managers can no longer vote their holdings without
first trying to obtain instructions from their clients.
But the most important changes are to regulations regarding capital
structures. At the moment, big Swiss companies offer bewildering
combinations of registered and bearer shares of sometimes varying nominal
values, some of which are restricted to Swiss nationals, some not. To top it
off, some have participation and/or dividend right certificates as well.
Under the new law, dividend right certificates may not have a nominal value
and can only be issued without charge as a means of remuneration to
founders, directors, shareholders or employees. This rules out the practice
of issuing them to raise capital, as Roche, the pharmaceutical group, has
done on a massive scale.
Participation certificates may still be issued, but the total nominal value
may not be more than twice the the nominal value of the share capital.
Finally, the new law reduces the minimum nominal value for all classes of
shares and participation certificates from SFr100 to SFr10. This is of
particular appeal to the many Swiss companies whose shares are extremely
high priced.
EMS-Chemie, the Zurich fine chemicals group, announced last month it would
split its registered and bearer shares to attract a wider group of
investors. The bearers now cost a whopping SFr5,300 apiece.
Nestle, whose bearer shares trade in the SFr9,300 range, has made no secret
of its intention to do the same, although it has not yet revealed details.
There has been considerable speculation among Swiss equity analysts about
how each company is going to restructure its capital. In some cases, the
restructurings could remove the discounts and premiums now attached to
different classes of securities, and so offer the investor opportunities for
one-off gains.
Darier Hentsch, the Geneva private bank, has published its views recently on
what will happen at some of the biggest companies and banks. It forecasts,
for example, that Union Bank of Switzerland will split its registered and
bearer shares five for one and perhaps force the conversion of the few
remaining participation certificates. In this case Darier recommends buying
the PCs because they are at a discount to the bearer share.
The Roche case is the most complex. The group now has 1.6m voting bearer
shares of SFr100 nominal value and 7m dividend right certificates of no
nominal value or voting rights, but with equal right to dividends. The
simplest solution, to convert DRCs into PCs, is not possible because the
value of PCs would then be more than double the share capital.
However, it is difficult to raise the share capital because a majority of
the shares is held by the controlling Sacher family.
Darier suggests that the company could make a disguised split of the bearer
shares, offering three new shares for each one held and adding in a free DRC
at the rate of one for every eight shares held. The family could then sell
the DRC to finance their participation in the rights, and then the DRCs
could be converted into PCs.
Again, the upshot is likely to be more favourable terms for the DRC holders
than the current discount would imply, according to Darier.
Mr Thierry Hertig of Darier warns, however, that it is difficult to predict
the timing of these changes. Some companies, he says, may make them in two
stages, perhaps announcing a conversion of DRCs or PCs this year and a split
next.

FT  28 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Taiwan's privatisation
programme gathers pace / A report on the progress of the island's plan for
selling off state assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUISETTA MUDIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S sell-off of state assets is to gather pace in the next few months
with the listing of another six public companies and new share issues for
some companies which are already listed.
The island's privatisation programme has progressed haltingly since 1989,
when the ruling Nationalist KMT government's Council for Economic Planning
and Development set up a privatisation task force to develop a master plan
for the sell-offs.
Official estimates of total revenue from the privatisation programme are
around TDollars 1,000bn (USDollars 40bn) by 1996, which the government hopes
to channel into its USDollars 300bn National Development Plan, designed to
improve the island's infrastructure.
Five state enterprises have been listed: China Steel, China Petroleum
Development and three commercial banks. Twelve per cent of China Steel and
21 per cent of China Petroleum Development have been sold by public
subscription and allocated by lottery. Foreigners are not permitted to buy
in the primary market in Taiwan.
Securities analysts say the initial discount of 40 per cent was
unnecessarily wide, as prices have often doubled shortly after issue.
However, some have since fallen back and China Petroleum Development has
recently been around 5 per cent below the original issue price.
The sell off of Yang Ming Shipping started on February 25. Six companies due
to be listed beginning in April are Yang Ming Shipping, Bank of
Communications, Tang Eng Iron Works, Farmers' Bank of China, BES
Engineering, and Taiwan Fire and Marine Insurance.
Another 15 per cent of China Steel will also be offered, including about
USDollars 400m of shares in an international offering underwritten and
co-ordinated by Goldman Sachs of the US. As much as half of this will be
sold in European markets.
Analysts say that although this next stage in the programme could bring an
estimated TDollars 350bn to government coffers, complete government
withdrawal from public companies is being impeded both by labour unions and
politicians.
Companies selected for privatisation are those which are losing the edge in
increasingly competitive industries such as banking, steel and
petrochemicals, they say.
Under the current programme, a maximum of 51 per cent of each company will
be sold off, so as not to saturate capital markets and in order that the
programme should be completed by the year 2000. Although companies with a 49
per cent government stake are technically private, government influence
could and would still be brought to bear.
Mr Chen Po-chih, professor of economics at National Taiwan University, says
a large proportion of shares will be absorbed by employee compensation
deals, and that high remuneration packages for public sector employees and
the political cost to the nationalist Kuomintang government of creating
redundancies are the main contributing factors to the government's cautious
approach.
Mr Chen says that there is a tradition of favour-granting surrounding
state-owned enterprises, and those with vested interests are digging in
their heels.
Other analysts have criticised the government for not moving fast enough to
privatise healthy companies, and for privatising the poor performers too
quickly in order to avoid responsibility for inevitable redundancies.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA Steel's planned Dollars 400m equity offering is likely to be the first
sale of global depositary receipts (GDRs) by a Taiwanese company, opening a
new avenue for international equity investment in the country, writes Simon
London.
GDRs are like the American depositary receipts (ADRs) issued by overseas
companies in the US. Shares underlying the receipts are held by a
depositary, usually a bank, and the GDRs are traded over the counter.
Currently, equity investors in Taiwan must either buy convertible bonds or
invest through one of 16 foreign banks which have been allocated fixed
limits for direct investment by the government.
Both routes have drawbacks. There is no legal mechanism for bonds to be
converted into equity, so buyers are gambling that new regulations allowing
conversion will be introduced before the bonds mature.
Direct investment through approved foreign banks is complex and has not
proved popular. Only Dollars 350m has been invested in this way, against a
total limit of Dollars 750m agreed with the government.
Once the China Steel offering has been launched, other Taiwanese companies
are planning to launch either GDR or convertible bond issues. President
Enterprises, the food company, hopes to make a Dollars 100m GDR issue by the
summer.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Disappointment at trade figures dampens
gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE advances in European government bond markets of the past few days were
consolidated yesterday as overnight news of strong demand for the latest US
five-year auction brought further support to prices from across the
Atlantic.
UK government bonds opened marginally higher, with the benchmark gilt
maturing 2003/07 at 116 25/32 . At that level, the Bank of England's latest
'tap' stock - with a 9 per cent coupon maturing in 2012 - was exhausted,
having first been offered in early February.
The tap has acted as a ceiling at the long end of the market, and analysts
said prices were now free to rise higher - provided the Bank's next tap
issues are in medium-term maturities, as traders expect.
The generally positive mood of the gilts market was dampened, although not
completely doused, by what were widely seen as disappointing trade figures.
A 7.5 per cent fall in exports during January, while imports fell by only 3
per cent, was regarded as poor at this stage of the recession.
By the end of the day, the 2003/07 bond had gained  5/32 of a point on the
day, at 116 15/16 , giving a yield of 9.24 per cent.
AFTER Wednesday's excitement, the US Treasury market settled down yesterday
as dealers and investors set about consolidating the previous day's gains.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  5/32 at 101
19/32 , yielding 7.854 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/32
, yielding 5.342 per cent.
the day was the Labour department's report of a 7,000 increase in the number
of people claiming state unemployment insurance during the second week of
February.
The figure was above analysts' forecasts, but there was little reaction from
the market, although the data did suggest that the February employment
report, due out on March 6, will show evidence of a deterioration in labour
market conditions.
In the credit markets, the Federal Reserve arranged a series of overnight
matched sale agreements in an attempt to drain money from the system and put
upward pressure on the Fed funds rate. By later afternoon Fed funds had
firmed, and were trading at the Fed's desired target for the rate of 4 per
cent.
IN the German government bond market, a sell-off at the shorter end and
further buying in longer-dated bonds brought a steepening of the yield
curve, indicating a new direction after the heavy buying at the shorter end
in recent days.
Analysts said that the move by investors further down the yield curve
indicated growing confidence in the longer-term interest rate picture.
Further indications that the Bundesbank intends to keep short-term
conditions tight added to this feeling, even raising the thought in some
quarters that interest rates could be set to move higher before they start
to fall.
Bund futures eased off late in the day, the March contract on Liffe ending
at 88.34 compared with 88.41 at the open.
THE firmness in the US Treasury market was leapt on with enthusiasm by the
Japanese government bond market yesterday. Having closed at a yield of 5.385
per cent on Wednesday, the benchmark bond No 129 showed a substantial gain
at the opening at 5.35 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE DALLAS-BASED Seven-Up Company, the soft drinks concentrates business,
has filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the rival Coca-Cola
Company, alleging that the latter has been attempting to disrupt Seven-Up's
arrangements with bottlers.
Formally, the suit alleges 'tortuous interference and other unlawful conduct
including certain misrepresentations' by Coca-Cola of bottlers who handle
both companies' products.
The case was filed in the state district court in Dallas on Wednesday. It
seeks unspecified compensatory damages, and punative damages of Dollars
500m. There was no immediate response from Coca-Cola, which ranks number one
in the soft drinks market, to the suit.
Seven-Up's chairman, Mr John Albers, said that the company would make no
further statement regarding the litigation. However, people who had read the
complaint said that it concerned the lemon-lime segment of the soft drinks
market, which Coca-Cola entered in 1960 with its Sprite brand.
In essence, the complaint alleges that Coca-Cola attempted to 'seduce'
bottlers away from Seven-Up, by projecting various 'false and misleading
impressions'. It cites one Texan bottler, for example, which it claims
ceased bottling for Seven-Up in January as a result.

<TEXT>
TORONTO-DOMINION Bank has suffered a 5 per cent drop in first-quarter
earnings, confirming it is no longer the star performer among Canada's big
six banks.
T-D, harder hit by the recession than its main rivals, saw net income fall
to CDollars 115m (USDollars 96.6m) or 35 cents a share, from CDollars 126m
or 38 cents a year earlier.
Return on equity slipped to 8.6 per cent from 9.8 per cent, while return on
average assets fell to 0.68 per cent from 0.72 per cent. On international
business, the return on assets was 0.28 per cent, down from 0.58 per cent a
year earlier.
Loan loss provisions were unchanged at CDollars 120m, but the portfolio of
non-performing loans grew to CDollars 1.73bn from CDollars 1.34bn. A large
chunk of the increase stemmed from business in Australia.
The bank said net interest margin improved as lower interest rates widened
domestic loan spreads.
National Bank of Canada, smallest of the big six, reported first-quarter net
profit of CDollars 49.8m or 32 cents a share, down 9 per cent from CDollars
55.3m, or 36 cents, a year earlier, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The bank attributed the decline to the long recession, continuing high
loan-loss provisions and higher non-interest expenses, partly offset by
declining interest rates and good results from the investment banking and
brokerage subsidiary.
Return on equity was 11.3 per cent, against 13.4 per cent, and return on
average assets 0.53 per cent, compared with 0.60 per cent. Total assets at
January 31 were CDollars 37bn, against CDollars 36bn a year earlier.

FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: California files lawsuit in
Executive Life affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CALIFORNIAN Insurance Commissioner, Mr John Garamendi, yesterday filed a
sweeping lawsuit against numerous former officials of Executive Life, the
large distressed insurer, and of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the defunct
investment bank.
Among those named in the suit are Mr Michael Milken, the former 'junk bond
king' at Drexel who is currently serving a prison sentence for securities
law violations, and Mr Fred Carr, Executive Life's former chairman. The suit
also extends to Deloitte &amp; Touche, Executive Life's accounting firm, and to
three large rating agencies - Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's and AM Best - who
graded Executive Life.
The lawsuit, filed in the Los Angeles' courts, accuses the defendants of
fraud and deceit, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty and
various other actions which, it claims, contributed to the insurance
company's collapse in 1991. It asks the defendants to pay for all losses and
damages suffered as a result of these actions, plus interest, punitive
damages and costs. 'It is expected that total damages could run well into
hundreds of millions of dollars,' claimed Mr Garamendi.
Executive Life, under Mr Carr's management, invested heavily in
Drexel-issued junk bonds, and when the investment bank collapsed, Executive
Life suffered a severe policyholder run. The Californian insurance
department seized the insurer, effectively freezing its business, last
April.
Ironically, the suit comes as many of civil claims and counter-claims filed
in the wake of Drexel's collapse, and directly related to the investment
bank, may be close to resolution. Under a 'global' settlement proposal, Mr
Milken has agreed to contribute another Dollars 500m to a settlement 'pool',
while 200 of his former colleagues would provide Dollars 300m in Drexel
employee partnership interests. The total 'pool' would amount to Dollars
1.3bn.
Details of this settlement are being sent to interested parties. If the
proposal is accepted within time constraints laid down by the Drexel
bankruptcy process, participants could get immunity from any further
Drexel-related lawsuits. It has been suggested Mr Milken's Dollars 500m
represents 80 per cent of his remaining personal wealth - but this does not
include assets belonging to his wife or immediate family.
Few of the defendants have seen the suit. However, with this caveat,
Standard &amp; Poor's said it believed the suit was without merit, while
Deloitte said it knew of 'no legitimate basis for such a complaint'. AM
Best, in a more detailed response, added that allegations of fraud or deceit
which involved intentional actions were denied.

REPSOL, Spain's state-controlled energy group, lifted its post-tax profits
last year by 4 per cent to Pta70.1bn (Dollars 680m) after setting aside
Pta12.6bn for items such as plant closures, writes Tom Burns.
Repsol said the results were good in the light of its decision to adopt
prudent accounting criteria in response to an uncertain international oil
market, the difficulties of the chemical industry and the development of a
liberalised energy market in Spain.
Operating income rose 16 per cent to Pta129bn, despite a fall in earnings
from the group's chemical interests.

FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: JC Penney reports steep decline

<TEXT>
JC PENNEY, the Dallas-based retail group, yesterday reported a sharp drop in
after-tax profits during the final three months of 1991-92. It saw earnings
fall from Dollars 206m to Dollars 37m.
However, the figure was scored after sizeable non-recurring items, which
Penney had already announced would have an impact on results in the three
months to January 25.
Ahead of these charges, the company's profits rose from Dollars 206m to
Dollars 301m.
This improvement at first cheered the market and Penney's shares gained
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 64. But, by close of trade, the shares were off
Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 62 7/8 .
Sales during the final quarter improved by 2.2 per cent to Dollars 5.4bn.
For the year overall, Penney saw sales fall 1 per cent, to Dollars 16.2bn,
and net profits - after the Dollars 695m pre-tax charge - of Dollars 80m.
The previous year's figure was Dollars 577m.
Meanwhile, Woolworth - like Penney - also saw final-quarter figures marred
by restructuring charges.
It reported a net loss for the 13 weeks to January 25 of Dollars 128m,
against net profits of Dollars 149m for the same period a year earlier. The
restructuring charge totalled Dollars 250m at the net level. Woolworth had
warned of the charge, but the shares still eased Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 28
1/2 at close of trade.
Woolworth's sales for the final quarter rose from Dollars 3.06bn to Dollars
3.14bn, while sales for the year were Dollars 9.92bn against Dollars 9.79bn.
The annual net loss, after the charges, was Dollars 166m, against a Dollars
317m profit in 1990-91.

in 'difficult business climate'

<TEXT>
AMERICAN International Group, one of the largest US composite insurers,
yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 1.55bn in 1991, against
Dollars 1.44bn in the previous 12 months.
In the fourth quarter alone, the company made a net profit of Dollars
399.8m, against Dollars 381.9m in the final three months of 1990. The shares
gained Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 87 at close of trade.
The final-quarter result includes net realised capital gains of Dollars
10.3m against Dollars 4m, and the annual figure, Dollars 60.7m against
Dollars 59.5m.
The company acknowledged the business climate had been difficult - pointing
to 'the continued competitive pricing environment in the domestic
property-casualty industry', the US and European recessions, and particular
factors that hit fourth-quarter results.
AIG said that catastrophe losses in the final three months totalled Dollars
47m - against zero a year earlier - while restructuring costs consumed
Dollars 14.5m.
It reorganised its New Hampshire Insurance Company, to concentrate on small
and medium-sized commercial business, which resulted in staff reductions and
branch office closures.
Premiums written during the year overall fell by 1.3 per cent to Dollars
9.15bn, with a 6.6 per cent fall in the final quarter.
Despite this retrenchment, AIG said its main businesses - general insurance,
life and financial services - showed improved operating income.

AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US communications and computer group, is
to buy DATAID, a French software and information services company, for about
Dollars 88m.
DATAID is a supplier in France of professional services, facilities
management and industrial, scientific and technical systems. AT&amp;T said the
French company offered compatible and complementary products and services in
several key areas to its subsidiary AT&amp;T Istel, a leading European
information technology services company which is based in the UK.
The acquisition will be made by a public offering on the Paris stock
exchange, which will have to approve the deal before disclosure of the
financial details.
Mr Pierre Benhamou, chairman and chief executive of DATAID, owns 61 per cent
of its shares and is supporting the offer.
The French company which had revenues of slightly more than Dollars 125m in
1991, employs more than 1,500 people and has offices in France, Belgium and
Luxembourg.
AT&amp;T said that it would continue to be run by its French management, with
AT&amp;T Istel providing support.
Common areas between the two companies include facilities management,
computer integrated manufacturing and also value-added and data services.

FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Attempt to jail Nadir postponed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTEMPT by creditors of Mr Asil Nadir, chairman of Polly Peck
International, to have him jailed for his alleged contempt of court has been
delayed.
The creditors, owed about Pounds 80m, allege that Mr Nadir broke an
undertaking to the court not to dispose of assets.
Yesterday Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, for Mr Nadir, argued that the undertaking
had ended by the time of the alleged breach and that there was therefore no
basis for the creditors' complaint.
Mr Justice Knox rejected that argument but gave Mr Nadir leave to challenge
his decision in the Court of Appeal, resulting in the contempt move being
postponed to a later date.
Earlier the judge had rejected a plea by Mr Scrivener that the contempt case
be heard in camera.
Mr Nadir has been sent for trial at the Old Bailey on 66 charges of theft
and false accounting, involving more than Pounds 100m.

FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: ICI divisional alchemy only partly working
 -Pharmaceuticals produce 52% of trading profits with strong growth in new
drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI's DIVISIONS reported widely differing performances last year. While
pharmaceuticals and paints achieved record profits during 1991, the
performance of the core speciality chemical operations were described by Sir
Denys Henderson, chairman, as poor.
The pharmaceuticals operations increased trading profits by 10 per cent from
Pounds 489m to Pounds 538m on sales of Pounds 1.59bn (Pounds 1.42bn). The
business generated 12 per cent of group turnover and 52 per cent of trading
profits.
Sales growth of ICI's three newest drugs, Zestril, Zoladex and Diprivan,
averaged more than 50 per cent last year, said Mr Ronnie Hampel, ICI's new
chief operating officer. He said the pharmaceuticals performance had been
particularly strong in the US which now accounted for 47 per cent of sales.
About 10 per cent of the US growth had been achieved by increasing volume
and only 2 per cent through price rises.
Sir Denys admitted that worldwide government pressure on pharmaceutical
prices was of concern, but that its effect remained unclear. Spending on
pharmaceutical research and development was Pounds 220m in 1991 and was
likely to rise to Pounds 250m this year.
Trading profits in agrochemicals and seeds grew from Pounds 110m to Pounds
144m in spite of difficult market conditions. The business had continued to
benefit from cost reductions, said Mr Hampel. Turnover remained stable at
Pounds 1.36bn.
The paints business had enjoyed a record year, he said. Trading profits
increased by 9 per cent, from Pounds 108m to Pounds 118m, thanks to cost
reductions and improved margins within the context of weak markets
everywhere except in the Asia-Pacific region. Turnover fell from Pounds
1.64bn to Pounds 1.59bn.
Explosives produced a profit of Pounds 54m (Pounds 50m) in spite of
depressed conditions in the US and European mining and construction
industries, said Mr Hampel.
The core specialties businesses' profits fell 35 per cent to Pounds 35m
(Pounds 54m) on turnover of Pounds 1.27bn (Pounds 1.31bn). Both colours and
surfactants experienced further deterioration in their main markets.
Nevertheless, Quorn, the vegetarian meat substitute, had exceeded its
development targets following its launch in the UK, Belgium and the
Netherlands. The company was looking for partners, possibly in the food
industry, to exploit Quorn on a worldwide basis.
Materials reported increased losses of Pounds 20m (Pounds 10m). Turnover
fell from Pounds 2.14bn to Pounds 2.04bn. Mr Hampel said that was not
acceptable. Rationalisation continued in the fibres and films businesses.
Margins in the fibres business were not strong enough to produce
satisfactory results, he added.
Trading profits at the industrial chemicals operations were down 34 per cent
to Pounds 135m (Pounds 205m) on turnover of Pounds 3.61bn (Pounds 3.79bn).
The company said that reflected reduced sales volumes and margins in the
chemicals and polymers businesses which had been partly off-set by profit
from Tioxide, acquired in December 1990.
The group's 1990 results were restated to reclassify ICI's share of a
provision for the Tioxide Group as an exceptional rather than an
extraordinary item. The company said that was to meet the clarification of
the accounting treatment of restructuring costs issued by the Accounting
Standards Board. It had the effect of reducing 1990 pre-tax profits from
Pounds 977m to Pounds 936m and earnings per share from 87.9p to 82.3p.

FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps Williams rise to Pounds
168m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRITICISM OVER the accounting policies of Williams Holdings, the industrial
conglomerate, overshadowed its announcement of a 42 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits for the year to December 31.
Just over Pounds 40m of the increase to Pounds 168m (Pounds 118m) was due to
last year's acquisition of Yale &amp; Valor, the security products company.
However, average margins of 17 per cent across businesses ranging from
household and building products to engineering and electronics, ensured that
Williams still increased pre-tax profits by Pounds 10m without counting the
contribution from its most recent acquisition.
Sales rose to just over Pounds 1bn (Pounds 833m) although earnings per share
only increased by 5 per cent to 22.8p (21.8p). Yet the shares fell by 12p to
313p mainly because of a debate over its accounting policies.
Following the group's failure to win control of Racal Electronics last
December Williams is treating its 9.98 per cent stake in Racal as a
short-term fixed asset. The Racal shares - which it bought at an average of
55p and which are now trading at 56 1/2 p - are being valued in Williams'
balance sheet at 50p and the associated write-down of Pounds 7m is being
taken as an extraordinary item against reserves rather than profits.
Some analysts argued that since conglomerates are in the business of
acquiring other companies the write-down on the Racal stake should have been
taken above the line. Stockbrokers James Capel also questioned Williams'
decision to take a Pounds 10m write-down on the closure of its Banbury
conservatory manufacturing company as an extraordinary item, arguing that it
would have been more prudent to classify it as an exceptional item.
However, as a discontinued business, Williams said it was right to classify
it as an extraordinary item. In all, extraordinary items came to Pounds
23.3m - which included Pounds 6m of costs arising from its bid for Racal
Electronics.
Mr Brian McGowan, Williams' chief executive, strongly defended his right to
take the write-down on the Racal shares below the line. 'This was a one-off
case, not to be repeated. If we sell the shares and make a profit that will
also not benefit the profit and loss account.'
However, the new accounting rules may force Williams to take any profit it
makes from selling its Racal stake above the line.
Apart from the disappointment of a dividend of 12.35p - only just up on last
year's 12p - the group's management of the businesses, with its attention to
return on sales, was well received by most commentators.

profits tumble by two thirds in 1991 because of heavy loan loss provisions.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 32.1m to Pounds 11.5m as provisions leapt
from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 24.1m.
Mr John Goodfellow, who succeeded the late Mr Terry Adams as chief
executive, said the results had to be regarded as disappointing even if they
might be thought acceptable during a recession.
Total assets were Pounds 2.7bn, up from Pounds 2.2b a year ago, making
Skipton the 14th largest society by asset size.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Exor bid intensifies Perrier battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE BATTLE for control of Perrier intensified yesterday when Exor, the
holding group controlled by Italy's Agnelli family, launched a full bid for
the French mineral water company.
Exor and the Agnellis, who already control 49 per cent of Perrier, are
offering FFr1,475 per share for the remainder. That is the price at which
Nestle, the Swiss food multinational, launched its full hostile bid for
Perrier last month, valuing the whole of the water group at FFr13.42bn
(Pounds 1.36bn).
Unlike the Nestle offer, the Exor bid is unconditional. The Swiss company
and its ally, Banque Indosuez, have by contrast reserved the right to drop
out if they should fail to win acceptances for 50 per cent of Perrier plus
one share.
Mr Gianni Agnelli, chairman of the Fiat group and the man in overall charge
of the Agnelli family investment groups involved in the battle to acquire
Perrier, had earlier indicated that he would offer 2 per cent more than
Nestle for two-thirds of the shares; an option allowed under French takeover
law.
It was not clear last night exactly why Exor decided to table a full bid at
the same price as the Swiss counterbidder.
A day earlier, a Paris appeals court ruled that Exor, which has direct
control of 35 per cent of Perrier, had to launch a bid for the water
company. Exor is the subject of a FFr5.6bn agreed offer from the Agnellis,
who control another 13.8 per cent of Perrier through Saint Louis, a sugar
group.
The ruling was in response to an appeal by the Agnelli camp for an exemption
from French takeover rules obliging an investor or group of investors acting
in concert to launch a bid once they have bought more than third of a
company's shares.
Exor had hoped to be able to offer a lower price, FFr1,235 per share, on the
grounds that this was the price at which Saint Louis had bought its stake in
Perrier last month.
However, it appears that the Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs, the French
stock exchange regulator, decided that Exor must either make a full bid at
Nestle's price, or launch a two-thirds bid at a 2 per cent premium.

It is obviously disappointing that British Airways has not played the orange

merger, the airline alliance could yet have its day. KLM does not have a
credible alternative; BA is unlikely to receive a better proposal and can
bide its time. Competitive pressures might just bring the two together again
a year from now.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Imperial Chemical Industries is a bellwether, then yesterday's results
contain some gloomy news not only for the UK but for the world at large. The
company does not expect a recovery in demand for commodity chemicals till
1993, and then a slow one at that. Though its restructuring programme is
running to plan, there is as yet little visible effect on the bottom line.
That left pharmaceuticals as the star performer. They account for only 13
per cent of turnover but actually produced over half of group operating
profits.
ICI's aggressive restructuring means it is well geared to recovery once the
cycle turns. But the delay justifed yesterday's 2 per cent fall in the
shares. The current year looks difficult, especially since growth in
pharmaceuticals may be slowed by the expiry of the US patent on Tenormin,
the highly successful angina treatment.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Williams Holdings did not so obviously relish its maverick status, it
might have despaired at the 4 per cent share price fall in reaction to
yesterday's 42 per cent increase in pre-tax profits. Its operations, not
least Yale &amp; Valor, generated Pounds 40m cash and showed resilience in
recession. The figures will doubtless appear even more impressive as more
companies report.
It is nevertheless hard to quibble with the market's response. It is not
convinced that Williams has real momentum after the failed bid for Racal. In
addition, the group compounded worries about its attitude to accounting,
notably by the Pounds 7m extraordinary write-down of its 10 per cent Racal
stake. To protect profits thus is at odds with the policy suggested by the
Accounting Standards Board. It also raises questions about what will happen
if and when the stake is eventually sold. Any profit will have to be taken
above the line or Williams will risk another ticking off. Meanwhile, there
is an annual Pounds 7m carrying cost. Equally damaging was the normally
laudable decision to limit the dividend increase in order to re-build cover.
Given that earnings will probably fall this year, the policy suggests a
maintained pay-out.

FT  28 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Midland Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The question one has to ask about Midland is whether the bank that fell
hardest is now the best recovery hope. On an initial reading of yesterday's
results that appears to be the case. Thanks to a Pounds 107m profit in the
second half, Midland has generated the wherewithal to still leave over
Pounds 100m in distributable reserves. Assuming the momentum can be kept up,
the bank should be able to produce a fairly rapid recovery in profits.
Growth at the net level should be even faster because a substantial backlog
of unrelieved Advance Corporation Tax will reduce its tax charge.
The striking thing about the profit swing between the two halves of last
year, however, was that it was almost entirely due to the Pounds 150m fall
in provisions. That does not mean the bank was massaging the charge: its 3.9
per cent ratio of outstanding provisions to lending is high compared with
its competitors. But it does expose a disconcerting failure of trading
profit to improve in the second half compared with the first.
Admittedly the full year figures do show a 28 per cent improvement compared
with 1990, but the second half performance suggests a plateau. Midland has
already pared costs to the bone. There is a limit to how much further it can
go. On its own admission it cannot risk the quality of its service. The
challenge for the new management is thus to keep costs under control while
securing a steady increase in income. Only then will it have pulled off the
full recovery the market appeared to anticipate with yesterday's 9 per cent
surge in the share price.

FT  28 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: A right Royal disaster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,562.0 (-3.0)
The main question for investors after yesterday's bloodbath from Royal is
how to value UK insurance companies. Royal's drastic decision to pass the
final dividend finally removes what was already a faltering yield prop for
its shares. The focus will no doubt switch to net asset values, but judging
by yesterday's panicky market reaction, this is hardly a reliable guide
either. One need only recall what has happened over the last year in the
housebuilding and construction sector - initially drawing comfort from asset
values subsequently undermined by land bank write downs - to understand why.
The ignominy of Royal's situation is rubbed in by the fact that at last
night's closing price the market considers its once proud non-life business
to be virtually worthless. The company's capitalisation of Pounds 920m is
equivalent to what Royal Life might fetch in a float. To be fair, new
management appears to be doing what it can - even purchasing a put option to
protect its frail balance sheet from a collapse in UK equities. But the grim
fact is that there is no way it can shore up all the risks. Nervousness
about Royal's toxic waste exposure in the US may be overdone; the mortgage
guarantee liabilities in the UK, however, remain frighteningly difficult to
predict. It is sobering that Guardian Royal Exchange - with a mere 2-3 per
cent of the market against Royal's 20 per cent share - has already lost more
from mortgage guarantees than it did from the October 1987 storms.
Takeover speculation for both companies will doubtless intensify - but
investors would be foolish to bank on it. It will be a brave purchaser to
take out Royal even at the current depressed price, and there is no evidence
anyway of hostile predators in the wings. The sector's recovery will be slow
and painful; Royal's figures yesterday demonstrate that the ills can be
blamed as much on underpricing and overdistribution at a time of surging
claims inflation, as on the short term consequences of recession.

<TEXT>
THE ROW over Australia's constitutional relationship with the UK appeared to
be developing into an election issue yesterday for Mr Paul Keating, the
prime minister, after he launched a spirited defence of Australian
nationalism and criticised Britain's war record.
Mr Keating, who recently defeated Mr Bob Hawke as Labor party leader, has
come under heavy fire from Australian monarchists and the British tabloid
press who claim he insulted the Queen during her state visit to Australia.
Their wrath was aroused by a speech in which Mr Keating stressed Australia's
independence from Britain, and by his wife's failure to curtsy to the Queen,
who remains Australia's head of state. Mr Keating rounded on his attackers
yesterday by portraying Labor as the patriotic party, and accusing the
opposition Liberal/National party coalition of outmoded nostalgia for
British rule.
To the fury of his critics, and a number of Tory MPs in the UK, Mr Keating
went on to accuse Britain of abandoning Australia to the Imperial Japanese
army in 1942 by failing to defend the Malaysian Peninsula, of abandoning
Singapore and of attempting to prevent the return of Australian troops to
Australia.
The allegations are, in fact, relatively uncontroversial in Australia.
Historians have long believed that Winston Churchill gave the defence of
Burma priority over Australia. However, such a frontal assault by the leader
of a Commonwealth country is likely to have caused the British government to
wince.
A small band of Tory MPs sprang to the defence of the realm. Sir John Stokes
said: 'It is quite untrue to say we deserted Australia in the war. We fought
in Malaya and Singapore and many British servicemen were killed.'
Mr Anthony Beaumont-Dark described Mr Keating's behaviour as 'thoroughly
despicable.'
'He is trying to use the Queen for what he thinks is his political
advantage,' he said.
The Foreign Office was suitably diplomatic. Mr Keating's remarks, it said,
'seem to have been made in a domestic political context and to have been
addressed to the Australian opposition'.
They may be right. Mr Keating's nationalist sabre-rattling could be a potent
vote-winner for Labor if it can depict the conservative coalition as
backward looking and ashamed of Australia's developing multiracial culture.
Fewer than than 60 per cent of Australians now have a family link with the
UK, compared with about 90 per cent just after the Second World War and
nearly 100 per cent in 1901, when the continent's six British colonies
achieved independence as a single federal state.
Mr Keating was careful to say he did not expect Australia to become a
republic during his period in office, although he expected the monarchy to
be abolished 'eventually'.
The small Australian Republican Movement, which has sprung to prominence
since the tabloid attacks began, said it hoped public resentment at British
interference would grow into support for constitutional change.
Senator Chris Schacht, a veteran republican campaigner, said the British
media had given the republican cause its biggest boost 'for years'. The
republicans plan a national convention later this year to draw up detailed
proposals for constitutional change.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Ministers 'kept in dark' on supergun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS were kept in the dark about a large contract to supply explosive
propellant for the Iraqi supergun, a senior civil servant admitted
yesterday.
Mr Nicholas Bevan, an under-secretary at the Ministry of Defence, told MPs
at the Commons trade and industry committee investigating the supergun
affair that Foreign Office officials made overtures to the Belgian
government about the order without any ministerial approval or knowledge.
The MoD was told about the order by Astra, the UK munitions company, which
had discovered the propellants deal on the order books of PRB, a newly
acquired subsidiary, in the autumn of 1989, six months before British
customs officials seized barrel parts for the supergun after an intelligence
tip-off.
Mr Bevan said the Astra information was passed on to the Foreign Office but
no ministers were told about it. 'I saw no reason why ministers should
know,' he said. He added: 'Ministers were not informed. The Foreign Office
decided it was not necessary to inform ministers before approaching the
Belgian government'.
Mr Alan Clark, defence procurement minister, sitting next to Mr Bevan in the
committee, said he only found out about the supergun the following April at
the time of the seizure.
Asked by Mr Jim Cousins, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central, if he
was content that such a sensitive matter should be handled exclusively by
officials, Mr Clark replied: 'Not entirely.'
Mr Cousins pointed out to Mr Bevan that at the time a Belgian aircraft had
already dispatched propellant bound for Iraq. He said: 'You were happy to
leave the matter in the hands of a government that you knew had already used
its own aircraft to ship the propellant on to Iraq?'
Mr Bevan said there had been nothing else that British officials could do
since the export from Belgian did not contravene British law. He said the
decision to make the approach without informing ministers had been taken by
Mr Roger Harding, who at the time was director-general of marketing at the
MoD.
Mr Gerald James, the former chairman of Astra, told the committee at an
earlier session that when the company first acquired PRB and before he made
any approach to government officials, he had been warned by Mr Harding to
disclose any suspicious orders on the PRB books to the MoD.

Local government job of the year. Finance director to 'undertake the

38,361-Pounds 41,268 plus Pounds 978 car allowance etc.
Candidate must have 'the input and vision necessary to lead the authority
through the formidable challenges of the future.' Formidable indeed - the
employer is Comhairle nan Eilean, the Western Isles Council, whose Pounds
23m loss in BCCI cost Donald Macleod, last holder of the post, his job.
The resulting borrowing is likely to cost the 31,500 islanders about Pounds
3.4m a year for 30 years, and this year's poll tax has gone up 470 per cent,
from Pounds 26 to Pounds 122, plus Pounds 58 water charge. The new finance
director's salary is a lot more than most of the islands' crofting
inhabitants make, and even the higher poll tax shouldn't be too much of a

If 3i, Britain's biggest venture capitalist, was advising a customer on how
to manage a successful stock market debut, it would not be counselling it to
replace its chairman, chief executive and finance director only months
before the flotation. This is what companies in trouble do.
However, 3i does not seem to think there is anything unusual in the fact
that it has yet to find a successor to its own chairman, Sir John Cuckney;
and now chief executive David Marlow is retiring early. 3i's chief
executives often retire early it seems, and anyway finance director Ewen
Macpherson, the new ceo, has been with the firm for 22 years and Brian
Larcombe, the new finance director, has been there almost as long. They
should know the ropes.
3i prides itself on its management in depth, but this is part of its
problem. It is a big and rather inbred animal whose managers are not well
known in the City investment community. Tinkering with a trusted management
team at this late stage is risky, particularly given the market's current
nervousness about the unquoted investment trust sector.

Picturesque; but not strictly applicable over here. The American robin is a
quite different bird from the British variety - larger, gaudier, and never
seen on Christmas cards. So if British optimists want to take the Brady

And pessimists must come up with a bird of ill omen. Traditionally, an owl.
But owls on the lawn? Hardly.

If the Bank of England really wanted to give a lead on corporate governance
issues, it could start by shaking up its own court of non-executive
directors. Take Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of non-executive director
pressure group Proned. He has been on the court for 22 years and Warburg's
Sir David Scholey has been a director for more than a decade. Good men as
they are, isn't it about time that they set an example by standing down and
letting someone else have a go? A four year term is long enough.
Meanwhile, Sir Christopher Hogg's appointment to the Court is the clearest
sign to date that he has made it into the ranks of the great and the good.
But he is still only 55 and his non-executive chairmanships of Reuters and
Courtaulds are hardly full-time jobs. Taking on the chairmanship of British
Aerospace would have been a more worthwhile but more demanding task than
accepting an invitation to sit at the Bank of England's Court.

It's a funny old world when South Africa's voters have to prove they are
white in order to vote in the referendum whose aim is to gauge support for
abolishing apartheid.
Those who carry identity documents issued after 1986 - which do not indicate
race - will have to provide other evidence of racial purity. This conjures
up visions of the bad old days of the 'pencil test': if a pencil inserted in
the hair failed to lodge there, a person could usually pass as white. But
race classification experts need not sharpen their pencils this time:
Pretoria will check identity documents against the electoral roll or birth
records to ensure that no non-whites sneak into the polling booths.
Meanwhile, the prospect of the referendum has sent South African whites
around the world scurrying to make sure they will be able to vote - nowhere
more so than in London, the main centre for South African expatriates. The
republic's London embassy reports that on Wednesday alone, no fewer than
1,350 people called in to find out how to vote.
Such is the enthusiasm that there is talk of hiring a jumbojet to ferry
people down to Johannesburg in time for referendum day, March 17. With an
estimated 50,000 to 80,000 South Africans resident in Britain - most of them
expected to vote 'yes' to a continuation of President FW de Klerk's reforms
 -the expatriate vote could be vital if the contest is as close run as some
people expect.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Social Europe: Opting out and cashing in - David Goodhart
assesses the implications for British business of the decision to reject an
extension of EC social provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain will become a paradise for investment,' was the verdict of Mr
Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. His angry reaction to
Britain's decision to 'opt out' of an extension of the European Community's
social and employment policy at December's Maastricht summit is now
approvingly echoed by British ministers.
They believe they have preserved the right of British employers and
employees to conduct their affairs free from centralised, continental
meddling, to the benefit of the UK economy. For Mr Delors, and supporters of
a deepening of the EC's social dimension, Britain is poised to become the
Hong Kong of Europe, its barely protected labour sucking in foreign capital.
This might be an unwelcome development but, to Mr Delors, it is preferable
to the alternative, a social dimension that would be limited to a few health
and safety directives, with the UK blocking attempts to establish a true set
of EC-wide minimum standards at work.
Now, thanks to their UK-free Maastricht 'protocol' agreement, the other 11
member states will, from 1993, be able to sidestep the UK. Should Britain
try to block a measure supported by the other states, they could use the
protocol to introduce reforms. That could mean legislation, covering the 11
only, on matters such as sex equality at work, minimum annual holiday
entitlement, and works councils for consultation with employees.
Whether this would allow the UK to consolidate its position further as the
EC's favoured destination for inward investment from outside the Community
is debatable. US and Japanese investors have, over the past 40 years,
generally preferred the UK for a variety of reasons, not least the English
language and the country's relatively low wage costs, especially compared
with Germany. Although there has been some sign recently of a switch in
Japanese preferences from Britain to Germany, Britain accounted for over 38
per cent of Japanese direct investment in Europe in the four decades to 1990
and for 61 per cent of such investment in 1990 alone.
That the trend in favour of Britain was particularly strong in the 1980s
suggests that the economic conditions which prevailed under the Thatcher
government were an important driving force. Among these was a commitment to
a continued regime of low non-wage labour costs (the social security and
other benefits that must be paid by an employer) and a relatively
unregulated labour market.
By contrast, in most of the continental EC economies, including the poorest
such as Greece and Portugal, the state intervenes widely to set minimum
standards at work - for example minimum wages and maximum hours - and all
have statutory systems for worker consultation.
For this reason many employers in continental Europe have found the EC's
social dimension easier to accept than their UK equivalents. Directives,
such as that on maximum working time, which would require significant
reorganisation in some sectors of UK industry, merely confirm existing
practice in most other EC countries.
Continental European employers, obliged to consult employee representatives
at plant or national level, also find it easier to accept the agreement
between UNICE, the European employers body, and the European Trade Union
Congress, which is included in the Maastricht protocol and allows the
'social partners' the right to amend EC legislation and to produce EC-wide
collective agreements as a substitute for legislation.
Employers differ sharply about the position in which Britain now finds
itself. 'Opt-out is good for smaller businesses and for businesses operating
only in the UK, but UK multinationals with companies in Europe may have to
accept the protocol in part of their business and that could get
complicated,' says Mr Malcolm Greenslade, director of personnel at GrandMet,
the food and drinks group.
Mr Herwig Kressler, personnel manager at Unilever, says he will probably
ignore the 'opt-out' altogether rather than have one set of rules for the UK
and another for other EC countries. Other personnel managers say they would
probably include the UK in low-cost protocol measures such as the works
councils but try to opt out of more costly measures.
The cost of implementing individual directives depends on the sector in
which a company operates and what it already offers its staff. Mr Greenslade
says GrandMet would face no extra cost from several measures, including the
EC's statutory maternity proposals. But having to pay part-time workers the
same, relative to the hours they work, as full-timers (a directive that is
currently shelved) would cost Pounds 4m a year and make it less attractive
to hire part-timers, who now number 16,000 out of a UK workforce of 21,000.
On working hours, Mr Greenslade complains that a 48-hour weekly limit would
force GrandMet's restaurant chains to adopt higher, continental-style,
levels of staffing. The UK chemicals group ICI says it would not welcome
legislation on weekly hours but adds that it lives with it in the rest of
Europe and could live with it here. British Rail, which makes massive
overtime payments, might face an even bigger bill from a 48-hour limit, but
Mr Gareth Hadley, a BR personnel manager, says cutting overtime should be a
goal of all managers and believes the government is wrong to oppose the
directive.
The commonest view of the 'opt-out' among larger UK employers - supported by
UNICE and some members of the CBI - is that it would have been better if the
UK had fought for a diluted version of the 'Social Chapter' under discussion
at Maastricht for all 12 member states. Big business in the UK and in the
rest of the EC believe the 'opt-out' could expose it to tougher social
legislation than is strictly necessary. The UK multinationals add that they
will have no influence over the development of EC social legislation,
perhaps for several years, and will then have to swallow what has been
established without them when the UK 'opts back' at some point in the
future.
Some UK employers blame internal Tory party politics for the outcome at
Maastricht, pointing to the fact that the final, rejected, version of the
Social Chapter included a more precise definition of the catch-all category
'working conditions' and ensured that the UK would retain its veto against
European works councils; the two issues considered the stumbling blocks
prior to Maastricht.
According to UK officials in Brussels Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, was ready to accept that compromise, but Mr Michael Howard, the
employment secretary, and a clutch of Thatcherite junior ministers, would
not. They cited the UNICE-ETUC agreement, with its undertone of
'Euro-corporatism', as the main objection, despite support from most EC
employers' groups.
Some observers say that the UK government is haunted by the memory of the
corporatism of the 1970s and that Britain would still be able to retain many
of its labour market peculiarities and its low wage costs even if it
accepted the protocol.
Moreover, EC countries that celebrate their corporatism, such as Germany and
the Netherlands, seem to manage their economies more successfully despite a
high degree of regulation. Inward investors sometimes prefer a well-trained
workforce to a cheap and flexible one, as Mitsubishi Electric said when it
opted to site its latest plant in Germany, and as the latest hints from Ford
about moving its research centre to Germany indicate.
Mr Howard eloquently defends his vision of European social legislation based
on national tradition, flexibility, and individual choice. He also points to
the UK's superior record on implementing social directives - the UK has
implemented 18 out of 18 - implying that some governments like to talk about
the social dimension but wriggle out of paying the bill.
Britain's health and safety record is especially good, although, arguably,
the UK is trying to export its high standards in that field much as Germany
is said to be trying to do so with social costs in general. And it is health
and safety legislation which the poorer EC countries have the greatest
difficulty paying for.
Mr Howard has allies. Small business in the UK sees nothing but good in the
'opt-out' and larger UK companies like Associated British Ports, which
revolutionised its employee relations in the late 1980s by moving all staff
on to individual contracts, are relieved that the UK will not be subject to
Europe-wide collective agreements with unions. Aspiring EC members such as
the Swiss and some east Europeans have also expressed an interest in
'opt-out'.
Mr Ed Streator, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in London,
says if the UK had agreed even a watered-down Social Chapter at Maastricht
'the perception of US business would have shifted in a negative direction'.
He adds, however, that there is some positive interest in the idea of such a
social charter in the US and it is being discussed in the North America Free
Trade Zone talks.
The debate among employers has plenty of time to run its course. Even if
events unfold as Mr Howard hopes, the protocol and opt out will not take
effect until 1993. There are also reasons for believing that the further
divergence between the UK and its partners will be very slow or even
non-existent.
In the first place, the UK remains bound by existing EC social legislation
and will continue to participate in areas such as health and safety.
Controversial measures currently under discussion, such as that to establish
maximum weekly working time, could still be imposed on the UK outside the
protocol.
There are many areas which remain outside the scope of the protocol
agreement such as pay, the right of union organisation, and the right to
strike, (although they could be taken up by UNICE and ETUC). There are also
directives, such as improving conditions for part-time workers, which
several countries oppose and which are unlikely to succeed even under the
protocol.
Further, with continental European economies growing only slowly over the
next few years, any added burden on employers, however small, will be
carefully scrutinised by the 11. Both the Irish and Spanish governments have
woken up to the possible loss of the UK veto and tried unsuccessfully to
water down the protocol.
German employers also are again becoming alarmed about high labour costs and
will do their best to render the protocol toothless. 'German employers say
that the social dimension is not a bad thing because it forces some of our
own high social costs on to all the others,' says an official at the BDI
employers organisation. But that makes them very unhappy about the UK's
'opt-out'. As the EC's biggest exporter, they also face the most competition
in world markets from the US and Japan.
Like Mr Delors' verdict this seems too sweeping and, in its own terms, too
pessimistic. The Conservatives may have won a political victory on the EC's
social dimension at Maastricht, but for the British economy, is not likely
to prove decisive one way or the other.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Arts: ENO revivals - London Coliseum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the February revivals at English National Opera have, at some time or
another, been connected with anniversaries. The highly-praised Xerxes was
mounted in 1985 to mark 300 years since Handel's birth and now that has been
joined by a revival of Rossini's The Barber of Seville for his bicentenary,
which falls at the weekend.
Unfortunately the latter is not much of a birthday present, especially to a
composer who was a leap-year baby and deserves all the attention he can get.
Both operas were entrusted to producers of known intelligence, but it would
seem that there was nothing in The Barber of Seville on which Jonathan
Miller's rapacious intellectual appetite might feed. The cupboard of ideas
was bare from the beginning and this revival offers only a few crumbs of
interest.
Its main virtues are negative ones. The production has nothing new or
controversial to say about Rossini in general, or this opera in particular,
and it confines itself to the old routines.
Most of the singers have most of the notes, but if there was ever any
Italian brilliance of spirit in which the characters put them across, which
seems unlikely, there is little of it left now.
Where any sense of enjoyment surfaces, it is usually connected with the Dr
Bartolo of Andrew Shore. This singer is well practised at the Italian buffo
roles and his easy assurance in comedy is allied to a welcome feeling for
character, in this case making the usually unsympathetic Bartolo a bit of an
old woman in an endearing way. The loving look that he gives Rosina at the
end, when he knows he has lost her, is really quite touching.
Indeed, it is difficult to see any serious reason as to why she should pass
him up for Peter Bronder's Count Almaviva, whom this production makes a
singularly unattractive, pampered dandy. Eirian James is the pretty Rosina,
dressed up in pink silk and red roses, the very bloom of innocence with not
much hint of the thorns that should lie below the petals; Michael Lewis has
the right brightness of manner for Figaro. But neither quite manages to
raise the spirits. Richard Angas's unsubtle foghorn of a Don Basilio
certainly does not. Jacek Kaspszyk conducts.
There is absolutely no comparison between that lacklustre show and the
scintillating Xerxes which is now nearing its final performances this
season. I caught the production on Monday, by which point two new singers
and a new conductor had joined the cast, and can eagerly recommend the last
couple of showings.
A carefully balanced team has in no way been upset by the newcomers. Louise
Winter makes a fine Xerxes, who sings with a bright, firm mezzo, and treads
neatly along the dividing line between haughty seriousness and absurdity
with which this production so amuses itself; Yvonne Howard was a stirring
Amastris, who rose confidently to her character's outpourings of revenge.
Noel Davis was taking over as conductor and only occasionally lost his
soloists.
Above all, this is an evening when the intelligent approach is fully
vindicated, for Nicholas Hytner's staging is still all of a piece, stylish
to look at, unfailingly clever in what it has to say and the way it says it.
If only Rossini could have been as fortunate.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Arts: Little Village - Hammersmith Odeon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is all too tempting to pass off Little Village as the latest incarnation
of the hapless phenomenon of the supergroup, as if memories of the
Travelling Wilburys and our own dear Notting Hillbillies had not been
sufficient warning in recent years, and the raggletaggle ghosts of Crosby,
Stills and Nash weren't still going through the motions often enough (they
threaten a London date in March) to haunt everyone's dreams. But a line-up
of Ry Cooder, John Hiatt, Nick Lowe and Jim Keltner deserves some kind of
superlative and the closest attention, not least because Little Village is
the first band in which Cooder has been officially enlisted.
Though Keltner is arguably one of the finest drummers in rock, and Lowe's
bass-playing is tight, propulsive and irrepressibly characterful, their
London debut at Hammersmith was dominated by Hiatt's raw-boned, intensely
wrought singing and Cooder's magical guitar work. As their eponymous debut
album (on WEA) predicted, maybe it was all a little too cool and controlled.
The new songs happily rummage through country and folk rock, soul, r and b,
and good old Southern funk. They produce a mixture that does ample justice
to Hiatt's delivery - he is not a singer to let an ounce of meaning or
expressive weight go begging - and which at its most distinctive sounds like
a tight, honest reincarnation of Little Feat, with whom Cooder played as a
guest in the 1970s.
There were moments, though, when everyone seemed a little too well-behaved,
as if the material from the new album, varied as it is, became too
constricting a format for such sparky performers; Keltner, in particular,
seemed restrained, and the music-making rarely took wing. In the end it was
the memories of Cooder one took away - his ability to turn the most basic
guitar solo into something richly strange, his powers to drive a piece of
rhythm and blues as though the style had just been invented; the sheer
imagination and instinctive verve of everything he does. That even
surrounded by all that collective creativity, his version of his own old
'Borderline' should have been the evening's highpoint, suggests that as a
band Little Village have yet to find their personality, even though as a
showcase for Cooder's incomparable talents they amply justify their
existence.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Management: When we were very Young - Lucy Kellaway pays a
visit to the chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless and finds a good deal of image and
rather less substance in the sleek modern interior / My office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Image has always meant a lot to Lord Young. When he was running the
Department of Trade and Industry, everything had to be British. In his study
at home, where old-fashioned family values are foremost, the theme is
traditional. As the chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless, the most important thing
is that the look should be modern.
'This is the office of someone who is looking forward,' he says, in case the
symbolism had not got through. 'A regency-style office means you are looking
backward.'
The main statement of modernity is a desk and matching coffee table with a
top made of limed oak and legs of oddly contrasting Perspex. The angular
black leather sofa and chairs, Venetian blinds and cool grey walls complete
the picture.
As you would expect from a skilful marketing man, Lord Young has got the
tone right: the room is comfortable and light. Even if it is not quite
'utilitarian', as he suggests, it is certainly not ostentatious.
Like the man himself, the office is slick; also like him it is strangely
lacking in presence. There is no clue either from his surrounding or from
his commentary as to how he has risen to the top in both business and
politics.
The only personal touch - and one which points to a sentimental streak
somewhere - is to be found on his computer screen. There Lord Young, who is
a keen photographer, has input a photograph of his granddaughter as a
background to the electronic menu.
Scattered around the room are signs of his previous incarnation. One wall is
covered by political cartoons - showing him doing heroic things like cutting
through red tape - which he says remind him 'of a misspent decade'. The joke
has the flat sound of one that has been often repeated.
Another trophy is a cheap metal plaque celebrating the 'Plain English Award'
won by a booklet called 'Action for Jobs', which he wrote when he was at the
Department of Employment.
A red ministerial box sits on a Perspex side table; inside there are no
secret papers (these are in a mighty locked cabinet by the door) but a large
collection of tangled plugs and wires. These allow Lord Young, who is a more
than competent typist, to connect his laptop computer to the telephone
system anywhere in the world.
On the whole, he seems happy to be back in the comfort of the private
sector, and looks supremely relaxed in his dapper navy suit. He is nowhere
near so busy as before. His new 'leisurely' life as executive chairman
involves working from 9 am to 7 pm in the office and taking papers home with
him.
He is a great one for lunch and dinner dates, and there are few free slots
in his diary for either meal this side of June. He is usually to be found in
private dining rooms at the office or at the Savoy Grill 'getting a rapport
with people, or cementing a relationship'.
In his old Cabinet days he had a private staff of 12 people who made sure
'that I did not waste a second'. Now he gets by with just one secretary, who
he says has worked with him for 17 years.
Her version is slightly different. Margaret, who sits in a smaller more
cluttered room next door, briskly states it is only 16 years that she has
worked for him. 'He always gets it wrong,' she says with the sort of
dismissive tolerance that makes it clear who is boss. Margaret - like
another Margaret in his past - is a capable looking middle-aged aged woman
with highlighted hair, who evidently has considerable sway.
Indeed, the rapport is so good, that he never dictates letters. 'She writes
all my letters,' he says. 'If I wrote them, she'd only re-write them for
me.'
Lord Young - like most managers these days - insists that his door is always
open to any of the other directors who share the sixth floor of the
post-modern Mercury house. 'There are no locks on these doors,' he says.
Instead there are circular peepholes so that anyone can peer through and see
what he is up to.
Back in the private sector, Lord Young no longer scans the papers so
carefully. 'I used to read them all to see if I was being hit over the head.
If I'm being honest - which is a terrible habit - my skin got thinner over
the years.'
Another difference between this job and his old one, he says, is that these
days he is 'more accountable for decisions'.
Shareholders in Cable and Wireless might be pleased he is taking such a keen
interest in the bottom line; the taxpayer might take a different view.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems revise policy on spending
cuts - Defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS yesterday diluted the party's most radical policies for
long-term UK defence spending cuts as Labour sought to turn job losses in
defence-related industries into an election issue.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, launched a revised policy paper
which no longer sets an aspiration of a 50 per cent cut in UK defence
spending by 2000. It calls instead for a comprehensive review of security
needs.
In the short term, defence cuts or orders for new weapons systems already
announced should be halted until after the review, the paper says, but it
still hopes for eventual, 'significant reductions'.
The party suggests, however, that technological advances mean fewer nuclear
warheads are needed on the four new Trident submarines than on the existing
Polaris system. The introduction of tactical air-to-surface missiles (Tasm)
is also rejected.
The party has been vulnerable on defence before, in spite of Mr Ashdown's
widely respected authority built during the Gulf war, because of its
commitment to cuts. The latest document reflects his belief that, although
not top of the election agenda, a sound defence policy is a prerequisite for
a successful campaign.
Meanwhile, Mr Gerald Kaufman, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, said
Labour had no plans for cutting defence spending and promised that a Labour
government would stop job losses from defence-related companies.
Labour would set up a defence diversification agency jointly between the
Department of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Defence.
The agency would have a small budget from within existing defence
expenditure to help companies with re-training and finding new markets.
Labour would use the UK's presidency of the European Community from June to
press for a European defence conversion fund.
Mr Kaufman said: 'The choice is between a Tory party which is responsible
for a quarter of a million and upward job losses in defence industries and a
Labour government which will take positive action, in co-operation with the
defence industries, to deal with this problem and ensure that those skills
are not lost to the nation.'
The prime minister yesterday expressed his admiration for Britain's armed
forces one year after the end of the Gulf war.
But he warned: 'The way in which Saddam Hussein still behaves is
unacceptable to us, unacceptable to the United Nations, unacceptable to the
international community, and we will continue to put pressure on him.'

FT  28 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Average poll tax rise in districts
may be 13.8% - Local Government Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST OVER 100 of the 180 district councils that have set provisional poll
tax rates have recommended levels above the government's target of Pounds
257, although only two have breached the government's criteria for 'capping'
or limiting expenditure.
The Local Government Finance Bill, replacing the community charge with a
banded council tax, cleared its Lords' stages last night and returns to the
Commons for consideration of amendments.
MPs are due to debate the changes under a 'guillotine' timetable next
Wednesday, leaving time for the bill to return to the Lords and go on for
Royal Assent on Friday.
The survey, for today's Local Government Chronicle, shows that the
unweighted average district poll tax for 1992-93 has gone up by 13.8 per
cent - more than three times the rate of inflation.
The numbers include some significant figures for 'other adjustments', which
are mainly to take account of non-collection. The highest of these so far is
Leicester at Pounds 63, while Plymouth's is Pounds 44.53. These may reflect
underestimates of expected collection last year, as well as projected
collection levels for 1992-93.
Among metropolitan boroughs so far, non-collection surcharges are almost all
over Pounds 20, with Manchester the highest at Pounds 69.13 followed by
Rochdale and Tameside both on Pounds 49. No council has yet set a budget
that could see its spending capped.
For London so far, with figures for 17 of the 33 boroughs, the
non-collection surcharges are generally relatively low. Only five are over
Pounds 20.
A Labour survey of provisional poll tax levels in London produced an average
of Pounds 258, though information from some which might set poll taxes above
that is not yet available.
Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, condemned the
'distortions' in the government grant system and said that if every
authority was given the amount of grant per head that Westminster received,
then 355 councils could pay dividends to their poll-tax payers - rising to
Pounds 823 in East Dorset.
He commented that Tory councils so far had produced an average rise of
Pounds 22 (11.1 per cent) while the average for Labour councils was Pounds
15 (5.2 per cent). This reflects to some extent how close councils were to
spending limits for last year.
Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, said Mr Gould's analysis
was 'bogus'.
Though ministers have been encouraged by the relatively low poll taxes so
far in London, for example the Pounds 250 set by Hammersmith and Fulham, in
political terms even this may be a mixed blessing.
Strengthening the capping system means the chances of an election protest
against a high-spending Labour council, such as contributed to Labour's loss
of Walthamstow in 1987, are greatly reduced.
Two counties, Warwickshire and Gloucestershire, have now breached the
government's limits on their budgets, but the process of deciding whether
they should be capped will not end until after the election if that takes
place on April 9.
The impact of county spending can be seen in the figures for the districts,
with Kent seeing some of the highest percentage increases. Some of these
come, however, on bills which were very low last year, though the rises take
them over the highly visible benchmark of Pounds 200.
Environment ministers have already conceded that the target figure will be
overshot as an average, but the government estimates that the excess will be
no more than Pounds 10 to Pounds 15.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, said: 'Our private
polling shows that the government is facing a new electoral backlash over
the poll tax. The bills that will arrive during the general election may
well seal the government's fate.'
But Mrs Gillian Shephard, a Treasury minister, said yesterday that if the
average poll tax was higher than Pounds 257, 'people will know whom to blame
 -it is the councils' responsibility'.
English councils have collected 67 per cent of this year's budgeted poll tax
income according to third-quarter collection figures published by the
Department of the Environment yesterday. Two councils, Brent and Lewisham,
had collected less than half.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major attacks opposition stance on
tax - Prime Minister's Questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME MINISTER stoked up the electioneering atmosphere yesterday by
again warning that Labour would increase taxation, and suggesting that the
Liberal Democrats also were in favour of such a policy.
As expectations of a tax-cutting Budget on March 10 were given further
impetus, Labour backbenchers renewed their charges that the government was
planning to use 'election bribes'.
Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, repeated the charge that Mr Major was on
record as having said that a promise to cut taxes and increase public
expenditure was 'dishonest and absurd'.
To government cheers Mr Major retorted: 'It is quite staggering how
terrified you and your party are of tax cuts - they still think they are
immoral.'
He stressed that Labour MPs had opposed every tax cut introduced by the
Conservatives since 1979, and that they were now threatening to reimpose any
tax cuts introduced in the Budget.
Mr Kinnock said Mr Major was head of a government which had imposed the
biggest tax burden in British history.
Mr Bernard Weatherill, the speaker, rebuked Conservative backbenchers for
what Mr Kinnock described as 'deliberate disruption'.
Persisting with his attack, Mr Kinnock said the prime minister had promised
to increase public expenditure, cut taxes and balance the budget. 'Your
promises do not add up,' he declared.
The prime minister emphasised that Conservative ministers had cut taxes and
raised public expenditure in the 1980s.
'Before you start giving lectures on borrowing get your facts right,' he
told Mr Kinnock.
Mr Major faced a further barrage of criticism from Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader
of the Liberal Democrats, who said industry was burdened with debt and
Britain's trade deficit was at the highest level for a year.
Mr Ashdown called on the prime minister to explain 'why tax cuts, which will
suck in more imports, are right - whereas public investment in the kind of
things Britain needs for the future are wrong'.
Mr Major contrasted Mr Ashdown's view with the policy of the old Liberal
party when it 'trusted people with their own money and believed they could
make their own decisions'.
He urged the whole country to note that 'yet again the Liberal party was
aligning itself, on social and taxation matters, with the Labour party'.
An early increase in consumer demand was envisaged by Mr David Hunt, the
Welsh secretary, opening a debate on Welsh affairs.
Acknowledging that Hoover and Hotpoint had suffered along with others in the
'white goods' sector from the downturn in consumer spending, he said: 'I
very much hope that is a short-term problem.'

FT  28 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Convention to hold hearing in
public - Scottish Devolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Scottish Constitutional Convention, which has drawn up detailed plans
for a Scottish parliament, will today publicly debate one of its most
contentious issues, the system by which the parliament's members will be
elected.
The convention, which includes Labour and the Liberal Democrats but is
boycotted by the Conservatives and the Scottish National Party, has not held
a full-scale meeting since it concluded its outline proposals in late 1990.
Although the convention's executive committee and working groups have since
met regularly, the issue of a devolved Scottish parliament received little
exposure last year.
This may have contributed to the rise in support for outright independence.
An opinion poll last month indicated that 50 per cent of Scots favoured
independence.
Labour is prepared to accept a version of the additional member system for
elections to the parliament under which two MPs would be elected in each of
the 72 Scottish parliamentary constituencies and further members from party
lists. Support for the Scottish National Party stands at 28 per cent, two
points up on last month, according to a System Three poll for The Herald
newspaper in Glasgow.
Labour remains at 38 per cent, the Tories are down one point to 22 per cent
and the Liberal Democrats are at 10 per cent.
The government would face a 'constitutional crisis' if it ignored demands
for devolution, Mr Keith Raffan, Tory MP for Delyn, warned during the
Commons' annual debate on Welsh affairs. He said: 'Devolution is not the
means to sap or repair but the way to safeguard and consolidate unity.'

FT  28 FEB 92 / Targets of pension trustees criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRUSTEES of pension funds should set more demanding targets for their
investment managers, Mr Tim Congdon, economist at discount house Gerrard and
National, said yesterday.
Speaking at the National Association of Pension Funds annual investment
conference in Eastbourne, he criticised trustees for typically expecting
real long-term returns of only 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent, whereas the
economic expectation was for 6 per cent to 6.5 per cent.
'It is not surprising that there has been a tendency for funds to throw up
persistent surpluses,' he said. He was puzzled that companies had failed to
provide inflation-proofed benefits during the 1980s even though investment
returns had been very high.
He was less optimistic about the near future. The ratio of dividends to
gross domestic product was 'somewhat high', he said. The total return from
equity market investment could be expected in the 1990s to be 'somewhat
less' than the historic norm.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, called for the
support of fund managers in implementing accounting reforms.
'There will be a backlash against what we are doing,' he warned, giving as
an example protests by the banks against board proposals on accounting for
the balance-sheet effects of securitisation of loans.
He added that fund managers might value information in company accounts
about staff and training, but companies would be very resistant. 'You will
have to speak up if you want that,' he said.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Government to cut rebate for Serps opt-outs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yester-day announced a cut in the rebate it offers to those
who opt out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme, thus lowering the
age at which holders of private pensions lose out by not rejoining the
government scheme.
Mr Tony Newton, social security minister, said that from April next year the
rate of rebate will be cut to 4.8 per cent of earnings from the current 5.8
per cent. The 2 per cent incentive offered to those opting out for the first
time will be cut to 1 per cent. The government actuary has called for a
rebate of 4.68 per cent.
Mr Newton also said he was considering offering higher rebates to older
people and less generous ones to those in their 20s.
The insurance industry, which provides most private pensions in the UK, has
largely opposed moves to an age-related rebate system, arguing that it would
not provide enough incentive for young people to opt out.
Flat-rate rebates favour those in their 20s and 30s by offering them tax
breaks far in excess of those to be achieved by remaining in Serps. But
according to actuarial calculations, by the time a man is roughly 45 and a
woman is 40 the rebate is no longer sufficient to justify maintaining a
private pension. Actuaries at Legal and General, the UK insurer, said the
new rebates would cut the opt-in ages to 40 for men and 32 for women.
Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, yesterday accused the
government of bribing more people to take out personal pensions.
Speaking in the Commons he said a Labour government would not implement the
proposed age-related rebate of 1 per cent.

FT  28 FEB 92 / The Mood Of Britain: Clearing up after one hell of a party -
Michael Cassell concludes his pre-election trip around the UK. He finds a
sense of optimism in Essex, in contrast to the deep pessimism that persists
in other areas of the country which have lost their past and not found a
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOSS CARS, one of the flashier motor dealers out along the Romford Road,
stands ominously empty. It seems the customers went first, followed in quick
succession by the cars and then the boss.
'We've got more motors to flog than Fergie's got fellas,' claims Trevor
Satoretti, one of the surviving cheeky-chappy dealers kicking their heels on
car lots to the east of central London. 'If you offered a free motor with
every gallon of petrol you still wouldn't shift them,' he says. Trade is
bad, he adds, but declines to put his theory to the test.
Much of the route from the City out through Bow, Stratford, Forest Gate and
Manor Park towards Essex proper, the land of conspicuous consumption, is
lined by unchanging inner-urban neglect.
In spite of appearances the local economy has until recently been thriving.
In places like Chadwell Heath the fortunes of first-generation retailers
have flourished on the strength of fat pay packets and easy credit. Video
super-markets vied for business with satellite television distributors and
camcorder and computer-game specialists.
Beyond Dagenham, with its rows of privatised, customised council homes
boasting satellite dishes and festoon curtains, lie Gidea Park and Harold
Wood.
Here, people like Henry France, an office equipment supplier, have made a
'quick turn' on privatisation share issues and have begun to worry about
inheritance taxes. Driveways are jammed with Mitsubishi Shoguns and Suzuki
Vitaras. 'Some of these houses need car park attendants,' mutters Nesta
Beglan, a cleaning lady heading along The Ridgeway.
The good times rolled in Essex in the 1980s. It became a cliche for base
materialism and the butt of jokes in which the local youth are portrayed as
sex-crazed simpletons loaded with cash. (By way of a printable example -
Essex girl to friend: 'Do you like Chanel No. 5?' Answer: 'No, I only watch
Sky One.')
Lynne Transom is the real thing; a 22-year old Essex girl who lives in
Barking and commutes into the City to work. She says of the jokes: 'Many are
based on the idea we've got above our station, that we're better off but
can't handle it. Talk about a classless society - it's pure snobbery.'
Lynne and her family remain optimistic in spite of the recession. 'Times are
harder, but we haven't done badly at all and want to do better,' she says.
The Greek island of Mykonos, not Leigh-on-Sea, is this year's holiday
destination.
But if the 1980s saw a materialistic binge, the early 1990s brought the
hangover. Mallards, the Ilford jewellers, advertises cash loans against the
diamonds or Rolex watches bought in better times.
'Mrs Thatcher invited everyone to the party, then made them pay for their
own drinks and left them to clear up afterwards,' claims George Wickham, a
former police sergeant from Brentwood. 'We had a brief spell of prosperity,
but I doubt we've made much real progress.' He points to the alienation of
the 'have nots' from the 'haves'.
The plight of those who have temporarily tasted a better life, only to have
their aspirations dashed by the recession, can seem particularly hard. At
Seven Kings, beyond Ilford, the streets are lined with Victorian villas
converted into double-glazed castles. Dozens are for sale.
Roy Ellis, a 30-year-old toolmaker, wants Pounds 67,000 for his
three-bedroomed home close to the station. A former council tenant, he has
no regrets about buying but needs something cheaper to ease the family
budget: 'Buying a home was supposed to be a one-way bet. But loads of owners
here have had to jack it in.'
Ellis is not exaggerating. Mortgage arrears hearings at Ilford County Court
rose by more than three quarters last year, with about half the cases
resulting in repossession.
With nearly 10,000 jobless people on the Ilford register, local job centres
recently had just 64 vacancies. Winston Simms, an unemployed roofer from
Hornchurch, is looking for building work: 'I did well for a bit but I'm
right back where I was seven years ago,' he says. 'Isn't everyone?'
In spite of repossessions and the credit card debts, the answer to that
question for most Essex men and women appears to be 'No'. Working people
here have invariably asserted themselves and live their lives the way they
want; they rarely reminisce about some past golden age. There may be anger,
a feeling of betrayal borne out of a return to relative hardship, but for
most there remains more of a sense of delayed advancement which they expect
to resume.
The optimism is by no means universally shared around the country, and deep
pessimism persists in areas which have lost their past and not found a
future. It is, however, possible at the end of the journey to draw together
some common strands journey which will form the backdrop to the coming
election.
For the majority, most of the 1980s were materially good. Real household
incomes rose by more than a quarter; many people surprised themselves and
bought homes, shares and even timeshares.
The British became sceptical of government's ability to intervene and
prevent industrial decline; coalmines and steelworks were shut, eliciting
human sympathy but invoking a new realism about the value of state-sponsored
rescues.
About 1m more people became self-employed - though not always because they
wanted to.
The British were not weaned off the state; the economic shake-out forced the
many jobless to become directly dependent upon it. And though people may yet
accept the princi-ple of more choice in the public sector, it is to the
state they expect to turn for education, health and public transport.
By the end of the 1980s, deep reservations also persisted about the
legitimate parameters of private enterprise. In the end, higher bills and
higher boardroom salaries helped give privatisation a rather shady
reputation. The 'divided nation' of north against south is not a cliche,
though this recession has temporarily inverted the old order, with the south
faring worst.
The most notable division, however, is not purely geographic but also
economic. Since 1979 the top half of the population raised its income by
four times, the poorer half by only one quarter. The solidarity which bound
those in and out of work in areas of deprivation has also broken down.
Surveys invariably show Britain as a contented nation, but it has the
second-highest divorce rate in Europe, a quarter of all households consist
of a single person and births outside wedlock have more than doubled in 10
years. The family, another political pedestal of the 1980s, is being
redefined.
'Large numbers of people have no one close to them to talk to, but they now
appear more prepared to seek out someone who may help,' says Philip Hills,
branch director of the Samaritans in Colchester, trying to explain the 50
per cent increase in cases on his books. 'Many have done very well for
themselves and their families in recent years. But human hopes and problems
remain basically the same.'
In the 1987 general election, with Thatcherism at its height, Labour made a
play for the nation's social conscience. The argument centred on the case
for lower taxes for some or better public provision for all. The Tories
claimed they could do both.
Five years ago, Labour resoundingly lost the debate and the vote. This time
it is trying the same tack, appealing to the voters' to follow it on to the
higher, more expensive moral ground. Its real challenge is to convince the
voters that, like them, it no longer has hang-ups about wealth-creation and
prosperity and that it can deliver, in a constructive partnership between
state and private enterprise, a better future.
Mr John Major, who must strive to sharpen the contrast in political messages
when most of the differences seem slight, must demonstrate that unpopular
elements of his political bequest have been exorcised. His task is to
promote a kinder, gentler Toryism, capable of looking after those knocked
off the ladder of opportunity, but primarily intent on promoting individual
rights, choices and personal ownership.
If the opinion polls are to be believed, people from the Isle of Skye to the
Isle of Sheppey remain divided on which flag to follow.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Gloom over prospects for property companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS expect the number of property companies going into receivership to
rise, according to a survey carried out by Chesterton Financial, a property
adviser, and Chartered Surveyor Weekly magazine.
Three quarters of the lenders polled expect a higher rate of receiverships
over the next six months, and half of them expect the upward trend to
continue for at least a year.
The survey showed a sharp drop in confidence about the prospects of a quick
recovery. Only four of the 60 lending institutions surveyed expected an
improvement in the market over the next six months. Last July most banks
thought the market had bottomed out.
However, more than half expected it to improve over the year, while only
three thought it would get worse.
Lenders have increased their average bad debt provision by 8.5 per cent.
Provisions against bad debts are likely to be the norm for at least the next
six months. The proportion of borrowers from the 60 lenders who breached
their loan covenants has fallen by more than a fifth to 13.7 per cent.
Lenders remain pessimistic about problem debts, with 40 per cent expecting
more borrowers to break their loan covenants over the next year, contrasting
with 25 per cent who had that expectation last July.
Banks have delayed putting companies into receivership because of the
difficulties of selling into a depressed market. Mr Mike Riley, managing
director of Chesterton Financial, said: 'We expect to see an increased
number of receiverships as the market improves.'
The largest proportion of the banks and financial institutions surveyed was
based in the UK with the others based on the Continent, in Japan and the US.

FT  28 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Birmingham introduces first Tec
trainee charter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRMINGHAM Training and Enterprise Council will be the first of the 82 Tecs
in England and Wales to introduce a trainee charter. This will set out the
rights and obligations of those in training.
Agreement to observe the charter will be a contractual requirement, a Tec
official explained yesterday.
The charter is part of a general effort to raise training standards in the
city. It is also a response to specific complaints from trainees about
standards. This, last year, led Birmingham Tec to cancel contracts with
Acafess and Cobalt UK, two local training companies.
The text of the charter explains that it has been drawn up after talks with
trainees. It specifies that each trainee should have a personal training
plan agreed with the training organisation, the right to continuous
assessment and written details of hours of work, holidays and pay-ments.
Training should be undertaken 'by experienced and qualified staff' in 'a
safe and properly equipped training and working environment'.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Exchange reverses move on trade rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of the London Stock Exchange yesterday approved in principle a
relaxation of its rules on publication of trades, heralding a reduction in
the level of transparency in the stock market.
The decision - part of a three-year plan to overhaul the exchange's markets
 -marks a reversal of the move a year ago to increase transparency by
forcing details of all trades to be published within 90 minutes.
Marketmakers - whose willingness to quote firm prices at which they will buy
or sell stocks lies at the heart of the market - had complained that the
90-minute rule exposed them to loss.
The exchange also agreed to increase trade publication in its international
share market, which has thrived on a lack of disclosure of trade details.
Large trades in both the domestic and the international markets will not be
published, but an hourly indication of trading volumes will be disclosed,
along with next-day prices to show at what levels stocks were traded.
The changes are expected to take effect later this year. They are part of a
move to bring together the UK and the international share markets in London
to create a single European market. Details of the changes will not be
adopted officially until April.
The board also approved a trial of a method of trading shares in smaller
companies, to be handled by 'matching principals', brokers with a monopoly
in the shares of a particular company.

UNION MEMBERS at the BP Chemicals plant at Baglan Bay, West Glamorgan, have
voted by a 3-1 majority against a strike over the company's intention to end
collective bargaining.
The ballot was organised by the TGWU general workers' and the AEU
engineering workers' unions which now fear that the vote may encourage BP
Chemicals to introduce similar measures at its other two main plants at
Grangemouth in Scotland's Central region and Hull.

FT  28 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Tribunal tells port to pay cost of
case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INDUSTRIAL tribunal yesterday took the unusual step of awarding costs
against an employer which had lost an unfair dismissal case, Catherine
Milton writes.
The tribunal ruled in August that the Port of London Authority had unfairly
dismissed 19 dockworkers at Tilbury because they were union activists. The
case lasted 196 days.
Legal experts said that the tribunal must believe the authority had
conducted the case unreasonably, and costs were likely to run into six
figures when they were assessed. The tribunal is expected to issue reasons
today.
The authority is appealing against both the unfair dismissal ruling and a
tribunal order that 12 of the 19 dockworkers should get their jobs back. The
appeal is likely to last another week.

FT  28 FEB 92 / 8,000 Lloyd's Names may face 25% rise in losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER, ANDREW JACK and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES faced by a number of reinsurance syndicates for 1989 could be at
least 25 per cent worse than expected, according to estimates given to Names
at the Lloyd's insurance market.
The figures are contained in a letter written by the Bankside Members agency
to Names whose affairs were formerly managed by the Lime Street underwriting
agencies.
The total losses of five syndicates managed by the Gooda Walker agency, now
in liquidation, amount to more than Pounds 450m, leaving the 8,000 Names -
the individuals whose assets provide the insurance market's capital - with
average losses of more than Pounds 54,000 each. Many Names are members of
more than one of the Gooda Walker syndicates.
Lloyd's as a whole faces its worst-ever results for 1989, and the market's
25,000-plus Names face losses of Pounds 1.35bn - less than 15 per cent of
the market's capital. By contrast, one Gooda Walker syndicate is expected to
suffer losses equivalent to up to 750 per cent of the capital initially
committed by Names.
A Name with an initial commitment of Pounds 10,000 to syndicate 387, which
specialised in stop-loss insurance - offering reinsurance to Names - would
stand to pay Pounds 75,000.
Gooda Walker syndicates are among those specialising in spiral reinsurance,
in which syndicates reinsure each others' exposure to catastrophe loss.
Other spiral syndicates, including those managed by Feltrim, Rose Thomson
Young and Devonshire, also face heavy losses.
Bankside, which is managing Lime Street's affairs, says in a letter to Lime
Street Names: 'We have felt obliged to take a very serious view of the
possible losses which may arise from the (Gooda Walker) syndicates.'
The agent stresses that the figures are estimates and could be revised
before Lloyd's final results for 1989 are published in June.
Meanwhile, the House of Lords yesterday ruled in favour of Lloyd's on a
preliminary issue in the case brought against it by 33 Names who are members
of syndicates managed by the Oakeley Vaughan agency.
The Names allege that negligence by Lloyd's in failing to close the agency
was responsible for their insurance losses of more than Pounds 5m.
Yesterday's ruling means that a preliminary issue of whether Lloyd's owes a
duty of care to Names can be heard on technical grounds and that the court
will not immediately consider the details of the Oakeley Vaughan case
itself.
Lloyd's said: 'We always said the case should be heard in this way.' No date
has yet been set for the hearing.
Also yesterday Lloyd's announced it was launching an investigation into cash
calls made by syndicates managed by Devonshire Underwriting Agencies, in its
seventh review of syndicate losses.
The study will cover calls made on members by Devonshire's syndicates 216
and 833/4 in 1989 and 1990.
The developments come after Mr Ian Hay Davison, deputy chairman and chief
executive of Lloyd's from 1983 to 1986, wrote a letter to The Times arguing
that Lloyd's might not survive to the end of the century unless it undertook
a series of reforms.

Floating an idea: a barge with a plea from the Independent Schools

Mr Clarke pledged to maintain financial support for independent schools if

An Isis report this week shows that more than a third of the scheme's pupils

FT  28 FEB 92 / Securities Institute launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROFESSIONAL body for the securities industry, modelled on institutes in
the accountancy and legal professions, has been launched.
The Securities Institute aims to attract members of the London Stock
Exchange as well as people working in related fields such as investment
analysis, corporate finance and investment management.
The creation of the body is in part a reaction to the Big Bang reforms of
six years ago, when control of the exchange passed from individual
stockbrokers to securities firms. Since then, many brokers have bemoaned the
passing of the old 'club' spirit with the demise of the trading floor.
Mr Graham Ross Russell, chairman of the institute and a former deputy
chairman of the exchange, said he hoped that membership of the body would be
'useful for members' career prospects' and would give clients added
confidence in their advisers.
Unlike other professional bodies, the institute will not play a large role
in regulating its members. Statutory regulation passed under the Financial
Services Act from the exchange to the Securities and Futures Authority
(formerly The Securities Association), and this will remain the main
regulator for the industry.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Exports to rest of EC fall by Pounds 600m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL in Britain's exports to the rest of the EC was largely responsible
for the poor trade figures last month which saw the current account deficit
virtually double.
The deficit in the current account, which covers trade in goods, services
and certain transfer payments, rose from Pounds 409m in December to Pounds
794m in January, the sharpest increase since January last year.
Trade in merchandise goods - the visible trade gap - worsened by Pounds 385m
to Pounds 1.1bn last month against Pounds 709m in December. This was mainly
due to a sharp decline in the value of visible exports which more than
offset weaker January imports. Visible exports fell by 7.3 per cent on the
month compared with a 2.6 per cent fall in imports.
In spite of the recession Britain failed to close its visible trade deficit
last year with imports outstripping exports to leave a deficit of Pounds
10.1bn. Yesterday's figures suggested the gap was widening again.
Exports to the EC - which make up more than half of UK exports - dropped
from Pounds 5.3bn in December to Pounds 4.7bn last month. Much of this could
be attributed to a slowdown in the German economy. Gross national product in
Germany has fallen for three successive quarters.
Sluggishness in north American economies also affected British exports. In
the three months to January exports to the US fell by 8 per cent compared
with the three months to October and by 9.5 per cent compared with the same
period a year ago.
The only area of the world to which Britain exported more last month than in
December was eastern Europe and the former USSR. Exports grew from Pounds
99m in December to Pounds 118m in January.
Overall there was a 7.5 per cent monthly deterioration in the value of
visible and invisible exports and a 1 per cent fall over the three months to
January.
The underlying trend, gauged by looking at the figures on a three monthly
basis, shows that excluding erratics, such as aircraft and precious stones,
the growth in the volume of non-oil exports was outstripped by the growth in
the volume of imports. In the three months to January exports grew by only 1
per cent compared with the previous three months, while imports grew by 2
per cent.
However, the continuing lack of demand in the domestic economy meant that on
the month, imports fell to Pounds 9.4bn compared with Pounds 9.7bn in
December.
Imports were 0.5 per cent lower than in the previous three months, but 0.5
per cent higher than a year earlier.
Cars were worst hit in the exports field. The number exported fell by 12 per
cent in the latest three months compared with the three months to October,
and by 22 per cent on the year.
Exports of chemicals, one of the few buoyant sectors of the economy, rose by
1.5 per cent in the latest three months, compared with the previous three
months, and by 7.5 per cent on the year.
The biggest increase in the quantity of imports was in food, beverages and
tobacco which rose by 8.5 per cent on the three months to October and by 9.5
per cent on the year.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Suspended director of British Coal quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MALCOLM EDWARDS has resigned as commercial director of British Coal after
35 years with the company, he and British Coal announced last night.
Mr Edwards, who warned last week that 80 per cent of pits will close if the
government's energy policy continues, was suspended at the end of last year
after disagreements with other coal chiefs.
No reason was given for the resignation.
A statement issued by Mr Edwards' solicitors and British Coal said the two
sides had negotiated a 'mutually acceptable clean-break settlement and Mr
Edwards will be resigning his position as a member of the board of the
corporation on February 27 1992'.
Neither Mr Edwards nor British Coal would comment on the terms of Mr
Edwards' resignation package. According to industry commentators, Mr
Edwards's stance was becoming increasingly embarrassing for the corporation
and the government.
Mr Edwards has been increasingly vocal in his defence of British Coal, which
the government has earmarked for privatisation. He was re-appointed on a
five-year contract by Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, last year and
has argued he could be dismissed only by Mr Wakeham.
After his suspension last year the corporation had said it lacked
'confidence in his commitment to the company or his ability to negotiate
contracts with the electricity industry'.
A conflict between Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, and Mr Edwards was
exacerbated by the strong and public support for Mr Edwards in the coal and
electricity industries. Critics of Mr Clarke, including the Commons energy
committee, questioned the wisdom of suspending the company's most
experienced negotiator as British Coal faced negotiation of critical
contracts to sell coal to the electricity industry. These contracts will
determine the future size of British Coal.
Mr Michael Clark, energy committee chairman, asked Mr Wakeham to reinstate
Mr Edwards earlier this month.
There has been widespread speculation that Mr Neil Clarke wanted to oust Mr
Edwards in order to pave the way for Mr Wakeham to arrange a deal between
British Coal and the electricity industry which would not be very favourable
to British Coal.
On Monday plans to develop a main coal-importing centre were abandoned,
lifting a substantial threat to the jobs of thousands of miners. The
deep-water terminal at Immingham, on the Humber, had been expected to handle
between 10m and 12m tonnes of imported coal a year.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Car VAT decision overturned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TRIBUNAL on value added tax has overturned a ruling by Customs and Excise
that the cost of cars provided by Co-operative Insurance Society to
employees is liable to the tax.
The tribunal ruled that VAT was not chargeable on the society's car scheme,
which offered employees the choice between a higher salary or a company car.
Customs and Excise has maintained that salary forgone in effect represents a
contribution towards renting the company car for partly private use. Renting
the car for purposes other than the job is a payment liable for VAT.
The society argued that its scheme was not equivalent to charging a cash sum
for the use of company cars but simply an element in the calculation of
salaries.
The society's arrangement is relatively unusual and may not apply directly
to other company car schemes because it offers employees a choice of two
employment contracts. The position for companies offering a single
employment contract with either option remains unclear. Several companies
and tax advisers have been awaiting the outcome to determine the structure
of car schemes.
Mr Mike Ward, society taxation manager, said: 'We are pleased with the
court's judgment, which we believe is fair and clearly argued.'
Customs and Excise said yesterday it had not yet had time to decide whether
to appeal.
The VAT argument is being watched with close interest by business car
operators and vehicle manufacturers.

FT  28 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): London pay blow for civil servants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN by Civil Service unions for higher London weighting allowances
received a setback yesterday when the National Audit Office backed a
government move to replace the rises with a different form of payment.
The NAO, the government's watchdog on the use of public funds, said 'local
pay additions' were a more economical means of addressing local recruitment
and retention problems.
Such additions, already paid to many civil servants, were an effective,
cheap and flexible response to recruitment difficulties, said the NAO.
Last month the two largest Civil Service unions called out their London
members on a one-day strike in a campaign to persuade the government to
increase London weighting for the first time since 1988.
The top London allowance for civil servants is Pounds 1,750 a year compared
with more than Pounds 4,000 paid to some staff by financial services
companies.
The Treasury argues that local additions and other methods of targeting pay
are a more cost-effective way of tackling staff turnover because they need
be paid only where recruitment and retention difficulties require them.
Local additions were introduced in 1988 and are paid to 65,000 civil
servants - more than 10 per cent of the total - at an annual cost of Pounds
32m, of which Pounds 23m goes to London workers. A survey by the NAO of
Department of Trade and Industry clerical grades in six areas showed that
local additions had helped improve recruitment and the department's relative
pay position.
It found a weaker link between local additions and staff retention, however.
'It was clear that many other factors beyond pay influenced people's
decision whether to stay or leave,' the NAO explained. Factors included good
management, job satisfaction and good career prospects.
Unions argue that the system of local additions is under-resourced and is
divisive because it can lead to staff doing the same job in the same area
for different salaries.
The CPSA Civil Service union said yesterday that problems would grow when
the recession ended and competition by employers for workers increased.
Local Pay Additions. National Audit Office. HMSO, Pounds 5.80.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Democratic majority in the US House of Representatives yesterday
rejected a package of measures proposed by President George Bush to boost
economic growth, and passed its own package of tax cuts instead.
The Bush package, announced in the president's State of the Union message a
month ago, would have included a cut in the capital gains tax rate, an
investment tax allowance and tax incentives for first-time home buyers.
But the Democrats attacked President Bush for helping the wealthy, and for
dropping the Dollars 500-per-child increase in personal tax allowances which
the president had promised middle-income families in the same State of the
Union address.
They preferred a package based on a temporary Dollars 200-per-person tax
credit, which would benefit 80 per cent of taxpayers, to be financed by a
new higher band of income tax and a permanent 10 per cent surtax on incomes
over Dollars 1m.
President Bush has promised to veto the Democrats' bill because of this tax
increase, even though their package would also index capital gains to
inflation, an idea backed by many Republicans,
Mr Tom Foley, the House Speaker, said yesterday that he was not convinced
that Mr Bush would carry out this veto threat.
However, the Democrats' bill only narrowly passed the House by 221 votes to
210, well short of the two thirds margin needed to override a presidential
veto.
The Democrats had some difficulty agreeing their package and had to tinker
with the proposals right up to the last minute to ensure its passage.
The US Senate last night confirmed Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal
Reserve for a second four-year term, AP-DJ reports from Washington.

PRESIDENT George Bush and leaders from six Latin American nations yesterday
concluded a two-day drug summit in San Antonio, Texas, by announcing
measures to promote co-operation in their war against drugs, writes Damian
Fraser from San Antonio.
However, the US refused to give any new money to the Latin nations, despite
repeated requests from Peru for more aid. President George Bush said 'we are
dealing in a time of sparse resources. We don't have all the money to spend
on all the programmes we think are worthwhile.'
The seven nations did agree to set up a permanent structure for an annual
meeting to co-ordinate the fight against drugs. They will also seek to curb
the trade in chemicals necessary for the processing of cocaine, and help
each other in spotting and seizing aircraft used for drugs trafficking. They
announced their intention to seek further financial aid from Japan and
Europe to support the campaign.

today. .
The war 'has resulted in an unprecedented disaster for the region, which has
been left with a serious impact on the sea, land and atmosphere that will
take years to heal,' the group concluded. The Meteorological Office in
London has said its studies of the region indicate the damage is not as bad
as first predicted, although long-term effects could take years to emerge.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Budget will be a test of the government's nerve: The risk is
that Finance Minister Singh might prefer fudge and compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR MANMOHAN SINGH, the Indian finance minister, is a man with a reputation
for caving in too easily under pressure.
His strength of nerve will be severely put to the test when he faces
parliament tomorrow to present the nation's budget and during the
acrimonious weeks of debate that will follow as his critics savage the
content.
The budget marks the second wave of liberalisation and economic
restructuring measures since the government launched its reform programme in
July.
For a minority administration - Prime Minister Narasimha Rao is still just
short of a parliamentary majority - this is almost certainly the last chance
it will have to put through a comprehensive package addressed to the issues
of fiscal stabilisation, tariff reduction and overmanning in the public
sector.
The risk is that, under the onslaught he faces, he will prefer to fudge and
compromise rather than accept confrontation.
There are already signs of Dr Singh's readiness to yield. The opposition,
whose attack on the budget is being co-ordinated by the Hindu BJP, the
Janata Dal and the left, received a boost on Wednesday when they forced Dr
Singh to disclose to parliament the terms of a Dollars 500m loan with the
World Bank.
Notwithstanding the government's bold intentions, little progress has been
made over reducing public sector employment or in devising a mechanism to
allow loss-making companies to retrench their workforces or to close.
Mr Singh is expected to announce that the 1991-92 budget deficit has been
brought down to the target of 6.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP)
agreed with the International Monetary Fund.
But, with a shortfall on customs revenues this year, and fertiliser
subsidies and credit to the Soviet Union costing more than expected, Dr
Singh has had to use cosmetics to achieve the desired result.
Some subsidy and other payments due this financial year will be carried over
to the next budget.
At the same time, the BJP, the Janata Dal and the left - bulldozed into
silence last year by the magnitude of the economic crisis facing India -
have rediscovered the joys of populist socialist economics and of hammering
the IMF. With the help of the trade unions, they hope to mobilise public
opinion to counter what they call 'anti-poor' policies.
Worst of all for the government is that many of the ruling Congress party's
members of parliament share the doubts of the left about India's conversion
to market economics and the slashing of subsidies.
The opposition's hope is that this build-up of pressure will force Prime
Minister Rao to abandon Dr Singh or his chief advisers, or force the
government to back down from the more unpopular measures.
Criticism of the government's economic policies has gained momentum because
the economy has performed more poorly than Dr Singh forecast in his budget
last July. Inflation, which he said would come down to 9 per cent by March,
is at 12-13 per cent and has yet to absorb further increases in administered
prices.
Industrial production has slumped from 8 per cent growth last year to below
zero this. The growth in real GDP has dropped from the 4 per cent expected
by Dr Singh in his last budget to 2.5 per cent.
Private forecasting institutes estimate probable real growth for next year
at between 1.6 and 3.9 per cent, meaning that India will for the first time
in 15 years have two consecutive years of such low growth.
The government's strongest card is that none of the political parties wants
an immediate election and is unlikely to push for a vote that could bring
down the government.
Its other strength is that it has plentiful support from the IMF and the
World Bank, which see India as a major test case of their policies and
therefore seem likely to be more generous with funds and more accommodating
in negotiation than they would be with other smaller developing nations.
As agreed with the Bank and the IMF, the budget's main task is to bring down
the fiscal deficit while accelerating structural reform. Unless the deficit
is cut (the target is to reduce it to 5 per cent of GDP in 1992/93 from 6.5
per cent this year), inflation will not fall.
Lower inflation would enable the government to bring down interest rates and
thus ease the recession in industry.
The priority the government is giving to bringing down inflation means that
the bulk of the cut in the deficit will come from cutting expenditure.
Dr Singh is anxious to avoid new taxes that could add to inflation, though
he wants to widen the tax base to bring in rural and urban groups who
currently pay no direct taxes.
The cuts in expenditure will have to come from reductions in subsidies
(particularly fertilisers), curbs on government employment and from reducing
budget support to the public sector. It is over these measures that Dr Singh
will face the toughest opposition.
His task is made more difficult by having to combine fiscal stabilisation
with cuts in tariff duties.
The budget will give the first public signal of how far the government is
ready to go in opening up the economy by reducing protective tariffs, which
in India average more than 110 per cent.
But, as customs duties provide almost 50 per cent of government revenues, Mr
Singh will need to offset tariff cuts by raising excise duties, a move that
will meet fierce opposition from domestic manufacturers.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MONGOLIA said it planned to free nearly all fixed prices next month, an
important step towards a market-style economy that could lead to sharply
higher prices, AP reports from Ulan Bator.
Mr D. Ganbold, deputy prime minister, made the announcement at a meeting of
Mongolia's main donors. The decision will take effect on March 1.
'The prices of rationed goods could rise three, four or five times,' he
said.
Meat, milk, petroleum, cooking oil, rice and sugar are among the products
affected. The prices of flour and some breads will remain controlled until
the autumn harvest is reaped, Mr Ganbold said.
The price liberalisation, the third since January 1991, is likely to add to
inflation, already running at more than 100 per cent a year, according to
central bank calculations.
Representatives of seven donor nations (China, Germany, Japan, Russia, South
Korea, the UK and the US), the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and
the United Nations Development Program heard Mr Ganbold's announcement. They
were in Ulan Bator for a meeting on Mongolia's growing economic crisis.
The Ministry of Trade and Industry asked the donors for an additional
Dollars 450m (Pounds 257.5m) this year to cover critical imports. The
country is already to receive Dollars 168m of aid in imported goods this
year but is expected to deplete those by June.
Analysts said Dollars 450m was far more than the country needs. The National
Development Ministry estimated in its presentation that Mongolia's import
shortfall would total only about Dollars 87m.
The donor representatives asked Mongolian officials to prepare a more
detailed list of priority imports. No new aid was pledged.

FT  28 FEB 92 / World Trade News: US and Mexico face Dollars 24bn boost -
The North American Free Trade Agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SUCCESSFUL North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) would add an annual
Dollars 24bn (Pounds 13.7bn) to trade between the US and Mexico by 1995,
according to a study by the Washington-based Institute for International
Economics. The US would transform a visible trade deficit in 1990 into a
substantial trade surplus.
A total of 609,000 jobs would be created in Mexico. While 112,000 US workers
would be 'dislocated', the creation of 242,000 jobs would give the US a net
gain of 130,000 new jobs, the study suggests.
The study appears at a highly sensitive stage in negotiation of the Nafta. A
series of meetings since January has generated unexpected momentum, raising
hopes that agreement can be reached ahead of US presidential elections.
The study contradicts widely publicised - and politically effective -
predictions by political opponents to President Bush that the Nafta would
lead to job losses in the US due to migration of factories into Mexico.
The study argues that a 'properly crafted' Nafta 'holds the promise of
becoming a landmark agreement': it could demonstrate that a middle-income
nation like Mexico could be successfully joined to two high-income states;
it could 'reinforce and lock in' recent economic reforms in Mexico; it could
'pioneer the meaningful inclusion' of labour and environmental issues into a
trade agreement - something the Uruguay Round of negotiations on world trade
reform has been unable to accommodate.
The study forecasts that if the Nafta is successfully negotiated, Mexico's
exports to the US would rise by Dollars 19.45bn from Dollars 27.2bn in 1989
to Dollars 46.65in 1995.
At the same time US exports to Mexico would surge by Dollars 33.6bn from
Dollars 25.0bn to Dollars 58.6bn. This would transform a US deficit on
visible trade in 1989 of Dollars 2.2bn into a surplus of almost Dollars
12bn.
In the absence of a Nafta, Mexican exports to the US would grow more
modestly to Dollars 38.9bn, while US exports would rise to Dollars 41.85bn,
leading to a visible surplus in the US favour of just under Dollars 3bn.
The net gain in trade attributable to the Nafta would thus be worth Dollars
16.7bn in exports from the US, and Dollars 7.7bn in exports from Mexico. The
deterioration in Mexico's visible trade balance would be fully financed by
inflows of foreign capital, and repatriation of Mexican capital, fuelling 'a
rapid acceleration of Mexican growth' - with real GNP growth averaging 6 per
cent a year - the study predicts.
Mexico's trade with Canada, which stood at a meagre Dollars 1.9bn in 1990,
would expand by 30 per cent by 1995.
The study calls for the Nafta to be compatible with the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
It should avoid any taint of 'Fortress North America' and should include
commitments to 'harmonise up' environmental standards.
Nancy Dunne adds from Washington: Canada would lose about 5,000 jobs from
the three-way pact, according to the study. Its exports to Mexico could grow
about 20 per cent, but its imports could jump as much as 40 per cent.

Italy's public sector deficit in 1991 overshot original budget projections
by 16 per cent and reached L152,000bn (Pounds 70bn), according to Treasury
figures released yesterday, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The budget target
for the deficit was L131,000bn, but this was revised to L141,000bn in the
autumn. The overshoot was widely anticipated, but it makes the 1992 budget
aim of a L128,000bn deficit in an election year even more unlikely.

Several hundred demonstrators, mostly elderly people from the Sudeten lands,

reject the treaty because it fails to settle the claims of Sudeten Germans,
expelled from Czechoslovakia in 1945. They have been campaigning to regain
their former properties, now being auctioned to Czechs in a privatisation

<TEXT>
FINLAND'S centre-right coalition government last night voted in favour of
applying to join the European Community. The Finnish parliament debates the
proposal next month is expected to approve making a formal membership
application on March 18.
A majority of ministers voted in favour of EC membership despite tensions
within the ruling Centre Party over the effect on Finnish agriculture. The
Centre Party traditionally has represented the interests of farmers, many of
whom fear that EC membership would mean cuts in generous state subsidies.
The government warned last night that Finnish agriculture would have to
become more competitive.
Finland, a member of the European Free Trade Association (Efta), hopes to
join Sweden and Austria in parallel entry negotiations.
A report commissioned by parliament predicted that EC membership would boost
economic growth, create 100,000 jobs over the next 10 years and lead to cuts
in taxes and consumer prices. A recent opinion poll showed that 51 per cent
of Finns favour EC membership while 40 per cent are against it.
The opposition Social Democrat Party is in favour of EC membership.
President Mauno Koivisto, who has constitutional responsibility for foreign
policy, backed EC membership in a speech earlier this month.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Nagorno-Karabakh war pauses a few hours
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STEPANAKERT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PEOPLE of Nagorno-Karabakh had only a few hours' respite from heavy
fighting yesterday before both Azerbaijan and Armenia accused each other of
breaking the latest Iranian-brokered truce with new offensives.
Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, the Iranian foreign minister, arrived in the
Azerbaijani capital of Baku on Monday to mediate in the conflict. But the
fighting caused him to abandon plans to visit Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave
inside Azerbaijani territory. Instead, he flew on to Armenia for talks with
the Armenian leadership.
The three-day ceasefire came into effect in the early hours. But soon
afterwards the Armenian authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh accused Azerbaijani
forces of attacking the predominantly Armenian region of Askeran with tanks
and missiles and shelling Stepanakert, capital of the enclave.
In turn, an Azerbaijani presidential spokesman accused Armenian forces of
attacking Agdam, across the border in Azerbaijan, using artillery and
machine-guns, and of renewing their assault on the Azerbaijani village of
Khodzhaly, north of Stepanakert.
Khodzhaly would be the third village the ethnic Armenian troops have
targeted since the beginning of January. The other two, Kerkjan and
Malibeli, were evacuated and set ablaze by the ethnic Armenians, who claimed
they were the source of rocket attacks on Stepanakert.
The Nagorno-Karabakh government declared the enclave an independent republic
last month. Armenia is supporting it with men, food and money. Azerbaijan
rejects the enclave's separatist demands and insists that it can have some
form of autonomy but must stay part of Azerbaijan.
Direct communications with the enclave have been severed for several weeks.
There has been no electricity, heat or running water in Stepanakert since
early January, when Azerbaijan imposed a blockade on Nagorno-Karabakh and
Armenia. The city is living off winter food-stores expected to last another
three months.
Stepanakert's estimated 70,000 residents go underground into bunkers at
night, when wild dogs roam the streets and many of the rocket attacks are
made, so the number of fatalities has been kept relatively low.
Still, there are many casualties and a grim uncertainty suffuses every
conversation as no-one knows whether his home will be intact the next day or
whether a friend may have died.
Both sides concede there appears to be little room for manoeuvre.
'Azerbaijan is not going to recognise our independence, but we are not
willing to come under their dominance again,' said Mr Artur Mkrchian,
Nagorno-Karabakh's 33-year-old president, in a recent interview in
Stepanakert. 'Over the past 70 years, the people of Karabakh have seen with
their own eyes what the Azerbaijanis are capable of.
'Nagorno-Karabakh will become an independent state, or it will become a big
Armenian graveyard.'

FT  28 FEB 92 / Major gives his strongest hint of Budget tax cuts: Tory MPs
say PM 'boxed in' to April poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLEAREST signal yet that the government will use a tax-cutting Budget to
pave the way for an April 9 election was given by Mr John Major yesterday.
Despite the sharpest increase in the current account deficit for a year,
senior ministers privately insisted that the gloomy economic outlook would
not disrupt plans for an April poll.
They also stressed that the government would not be deflected by opinion
polls running against it.
Backbenchers were told to steady their nerves in case opinion polls, due
this weekend, show Labour improving on the most recent findings.
The parties have been running neck and neck but the most recent opinion poll
gave Labour a three-point lead over the Conservatives.
There was ill-disguised annoyance at speculation that Mr Major might want to
reconsider his options in the light of recent poll results and poor economic
indicators, reinforced yesterday by the Pounds 1.1bn January visible trade
deficit.
Dismissing reports of a rethink as 'absolute rubbish', one senior Tory
cabinet minister said: 'We are not going to take decisions on the basis of
two poll results and a couple of nervous backbenchers.'
While no final decision has yet been taken, most Conservative MPs conceded
that the government is now firmly 'boxed in' to an April 9 ballot.
Any postponement would allow Labour to claim that the Tories knew they could
not win and would provoke irritation among the electorate, one MP said. It
was also increasingly clear that uncertainty over the political outlook was
reinforcing the economic downturn by delaying companies' investment
decisions.
Few Tory MPs appear to believe that there is much to be gained by holding
out until the very end of the parliament in June in the hope of better
economic conditions.
In a rowdy Commons, Mr Major employed the clearest language so far to make
clear his backing for a tax-cutting Budget. When Mr Neil Kinnock insisted
that Conservative planned to cut taxes, raise expenditure and balance the
budget were 'dishonest and absurd', the prime minister rounded on his
opponent.
'It is quite staggering how terrified you and your party are of tax cuts,'
he told the Labour leader, adding later that Labour would cripple industry
with a national minimum wage and 'substantial tax increases'.
Mr Major was equally combative with Mr Paddy Ashdown when the Liberal
Democrat leader challenged him to justify tax cuts instead of increasing
public investment. The prime minister said that, in the past, Liberals had
'trusted people with their own money and believed they could make their own
decisions'.
No clear confirmation of the April 9 election date need emerge until two
days after the March 10 Budget, when it is widely assumed the prime minister
will go to Buckingham Palace to seek a dissolution.
Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, is thought likely to proceed with
a conventional business statement next Thursday, outlining normal procedures
to follow the Budget.
Strenuous efforts are under way to complete the passage of three bills
through parliament. Next Wednesday, the Local Government Finance Bill that
replaces the poll tax with the council tax will be completed. Business
managers also hope to finalise legislation setting up a commission to review
the structure of local government and a bill that takes further and higher
education colleges out of the control of local authorities.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Royal Insurance omits dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL INSURANCE, worst hit of the beleaguered UK insurance companies, is to
omit its final dividend after reporting sharply increased losses for 1991.
The group also said yesterday that it had taken steps to protect the value
of its portfolio of UK equity investments in the event of a decline in stock
market values.
Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive, said: 'The key thing is we are in a
recession and coming up to a general election. We simply could not afford
the risk of the market going into free fall.'
Mr David Barker, managing director of asset management, said: 'We are not
bearish about investment prospects but if there is a significant decline it
will have no negative impact on our balance sheet.'
Royal bought a 'put option' last autumn covering a large part of its Pounds
400m portfolio of UK equities. Under this transaction, the option's seller,
who Royal did not name, has agreed to buy the shares from Royal if the FT-SE
100 index falls below an agreed level.
The group's decision to pass its dividend led to a steep fall in the price
of its shares, which fell 16 per cent to 190p. Mr Gamble said Royal had
anticipated a run on its stock but said Midland Bank's decision to maintain
its final dividend had added to the pressure.
The pre-tax losses for the year were Pounds 373m - nearly double those of
1990.
The passed dividend - which had it been maintained at last year's level
would have cost Pounds 96m, including advanced corporation tax - is part of
measures to bolster a balance sheet battered by Pounds 220m of weather
losses in 1990 and more than Pounds 300m of recession-related losses in
1991.
Losses from mortgage indemnity policies - which insure lenders against any
loss of value on the sale of repossessed properties - have climbed due to
the difficulties of the housing market. They are expected to total more than
Pounds 450m between 1991 and 1993.
Royal has also reduced the amount of insurance it writes to improve its
solvency margin - the yardstick measuring net assets as a percentage of
non-life premium income. Total exposures have been cut by 10 per cent in the
past year. Royal has also recouped Pounds 166m from the sale of its Dutch
subsidiary to a European joint venture.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Sharp fall in exports almost doubles deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S exports, one of the few bright spots in the economy since the
recession began, fell sharply in January as world growth continued to
falter.
A 7.5 per cent monthly fall in the value of exports more than offset weaker
import figures, causing the current account deficit almost to double from
Pounds 409m in December to Pounds 794m in January, the largest increase for
a year.
The latest figures added to Tory jitters that the general election would be
fought against a dismal economic background. City analysts said the widening
trade gap at a time of recession pointed to serious structural problems in
the economy and that the fall in exports, if maintained, will further
depress economic growth this year.
Despite pressure from some backbenchers to delay the election until June,
the government looks set to fight an April 9 election after a tax-cutting
budget on March 10.
Yesterday ministers attempted to put a gloss on the figures which were much
worse than City expectations.
Mr David Mellor, chief Secretary to the Treasury, said the three-monthly
figures showed a rise in imports 'and a rise in imports may well in fact be
evidence of an increased level of activity'.
However, the rise was offset by the poor export figures. Stripping out oil
and 'erratic' items such as aircraft and precious stones, the figures showed
that the volume of UK imports exceeded exports in the three months to
January. Imports rose by 2 per cent compared with the previous three-month
period while exports rose by only 1 per cent.
'Import penetration remains very high and points to a sharp deterioration in
the trade balance once the UK economy starts to recover,' said Mr Gerard
Lyons, chief economist at DKB International.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the figures were
'a withering indictment of government policy'.
Exports in January were worth Pounds 8.3bn, compared with almost Pounds 9bn
in December. This was the lowest export figure since February last year.
The deficit in merchandise goods - the visible trade gap - worsened by
Pounds 385m to reach Pounds 1.1bn in January compared with Pounds 709m in
December. Imports in January were worth Pounds 9.4bn, a Pounds 300m fall.
The value of exports to the European Community - which account for more than
half of the UK's overall exports - dropped from Pounds 5.3bn in December to
Pounds 4.7bn in January.

FT  28 FEB 92 / BA and KLM call off talks on merger after five months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERGER TALKS between British Airways and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines collapsed
yesterday after more than five months of intensive bargaining.
Failure of the merger, which would have created the world's fourth largest
carrier, leaves in tatters BA's plans to build a pan-European airline to
rank alongside the US giants.
The much smaller KLM is left without a partner in increasingly deregulated
European skies.
Project Sahara, as the plan was called, failed because the airlines could
not agree on how much they were worth. This was 'an insurmountable obstacle
to reaching an accord', KLM said. A BA executive said: 'People know our
global strategy to expand through alliances but we will only do that at the
right price.'
The news caused dismay on the London and Amsterdam stock exchanges. BA
shares fell 11p, or 4 per cent, to 265p. KLM fell Fl 2.1, more than 5 per
cent, to Fl 38.2.
The airlines were attracted to the idea of a merger by the prospect of
saving between them up to Pounds 500m through combining their central
offices, maintenance and other operations.
For several weeks, however, arguments about whether BA would take at least
70 per cent of the final company, as it wanted, or 60 per cent, as KLM
wanted, have spilled into the public domain.
The plan was kept alive until late on Wednesday when face-to-face meetings
held simultaneously in the Netherlands and the UK failed to resolve the
disagreement.
KLM said yesterday that talks had devised a corporate structure which would
have been approved by European Community competition authorities. Only the
valuation question had remained unresolved.
KLM said it was still interested in international partners but had no
specific plans.
The Dutch government, which owns 38.2 per cent of KLM, insisted that the
airline had acted on its own in ending the talks. The government controls a
supervisory board which can veto decisions made by KLM's main board.
Without a link-up between BA and KLM, the future of heavily indebted
Northwest Airlines of the US, in which KLM has a 20 per cent stake, is
thrown into doubt. Northwest is strong on Pacific routes but weak in Europe.
A three-way tie-up might have helped solve some of its problems.
The collapse of the deal is only the latest in a series of aborted talks
involving European airlines ahead of de-regulation.
Under rules due to apply from 1993, any European airline should be able to
fly anywhere in Europe.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Appointments: BPB arranges succession
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Turner, chief executive of BPB INDUSTRIES since 1978, yesterday
signalled his intention of standing down from the top job at Europe's
biggest plasterboard manufacturer.
John Maxwell, formerly chief executive of financial services company
Provincial Group, joins as finance director, and chief executive designate.
Current finance director Brian Hogben, 63, retires after 18 years in that
job.
Turner, who is 60 next year, said that after an introductory period,
'probably months', he would step down as chief executive but would remain as
chairman.
Maxwell, 47, previously worked for Grand Metropolitan and Rank Xerox.
Peter Sydney-Smith, 39, finance director of British Gypsum, a subsidiary,
will be deputy group finance director, and is expected to take over as
finance director when Maxwell becomes chief executive.
'In some ways it is the end of an era' Turner commented yesterday. ' Brian
Hogben and I have been with the group for more than 30 years. 'But this is
not a sudden move, although it might appear so. It is important for
companies to arrange succession properly and we have been considering this
move for some time.'
BPB has recently been fighting a fierce price war with Lafarge Coppee of
France and Knauf of Germany, and has also suffered with the severe downturn
in UK construction.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Appointments: Albert Fisher picks from Ranks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALBERT FISHER, the acquisitive fresh food company recently fallen from
favour with the City, has hired Timothy Howden, managing director of Ranks
Hovis McDougall, as a main board director and chief executive of the
European operations.
With Stanley Metcalfe as a very active executive chairman of RHM in recent
months, the managing director's sway is seen to have diminished.
However, Albert Fisher's chairman Tony Millar, the entrepreneurial spirit
behind the 1980's expansion, reckons he has secured in Howden ' a first
class hands-on manager who we hope will drive the European business very
hard.' Howden, 54, is a fluent French speaker, and has spent alot of time in
Europe for RHM.
Richard Portergill, who had been in charge of Europe for Albert Fisher,
becomes corporate development director, Europe, staying on the main board.
Millar yesterday denied Portergill had been pushed aside, and suggested that
he was pleased to be released from daily operations. ' He recognises
corporate development is where his talent lies'.
Lenny Pippin, 44, group chief executive of North America, now also comes
onto the Albert Fisher board.
RHM meanwhile is replacing Howden internally, with accountant Paul Coker who
had been deputy managing director. He is characterised as a 'hard numbers'
man in contrast to Howden who has a strong marketing bent.
While the City gave a vague nod of approval to the Howden move - marking
Albert Fisher shares up and RHM slightly down - analysts were uncertain as
to how Howden would fare in the 'thrusting entrepreneurial' atmosphere of
Albert Fisher.

FT  28 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Argentine equities show signs of
maturity - Investors' initial enthusiasm is giving way to a more sober
analysis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's hyperactive stock market is coming of age. After beating the
world's bourses last year with a rise of 370 per cent in dollar terms, the
Buenos Aires Stock Exchange is settling down to a less intense, and more
measured, pace. That does not mean slow, though: so far this year it has
grown by 'only' 15 per cent.
The underlying fundamentals that powered the market in 1991 have not
changed: Argentina's embrace of free market reforms continue to pay off,
with relatively low inflation, economic growth and ordered government
finances. Foreign capital is still flowing in. These factors, combined with
a shortage of investment paper, led to last year's across the board price
increases.
However, the first surge of enthusiasm is giving way to a more sober
analysis. Investors are becoming more discriminating. Regulators are
cracking down on what is still regarded as a 'cowboy' market. Also,
investors' appetite for equities should be sated by a hefty batch of
privatisation issues.
On Monday, the government unleashes an international marketing offensive to
sell its remaining 30 per cent in Telecom Argentina, the country's
second-largest privatised telephone company. The flotation, which should
raise at least Dollars 640m, will inject liquidity into the market and
broaden its investor base.
Telecom - 39 per cent-owned by the French and Italian state telephone
companies - has a seven-year monopoly over services in northern Argentina,
renewable for a further three years. It forecasts a 40 per cent increase in
revenues to Dollars 1.2bn in 1992 and a 130 per cent rise in net profit to
Dollars 120m. Telecom shares should, therefore, imitate the performance of
Argentina's other telephone company, Telefonica de Argentina: its share
price has risen by almost 50 per cent since its flotation in December.
Other privatisation issues are expected to dominate the stock market this
year. The government plans to net about Dollars 6bn by selling seven
companies, which range from the post and telegraph company to big gas and
electricity util-ities. Controlling stakes will probably be sold directly to
the operators, with minority stakes floated on the local and international
equity markets.
Mr Martin Redrado, head of the National Securities Commission, says there is
'real hunger' for stocks in Argentina and doubts that privatisation issues
will swamp the market. Although prices are high, with price/earnings ratios
averaging 20, he says Argentina's market capitalisation of Dollars 18.5bn is
equivalent to 13 per cent of GDP.
Analysts say investors are becoming more demanding. Mr Christopher
Ecclestone, a Buenos Aires equity analyst, says: 'There is some disillusion
that prices may have peaked, but there is still value in second-tier stocks.
People who bought almost anything last year to get exposure to Argentina are
reorganising their portfolios as the economic picture becomes clearer.'
Banking, construction and food shares are popular, but he warns that the
market is still faddish and restless.
Curiously, interest from private companies in raising equity capital remains
muted: only five companies have applied for a listing and just eight
companies which are already listed made rights issues for a total of Dollars
300m in 1991. Privately, stock market officials say that Argentine
businessmen are irrationally afraid of listing, and accuse local investment
banks of not knowing how to structure share issues. Sooner or later,
however, Argentina's capital-starved companies will have to turn to the
equity market to survive.
Meanwhile, Mr Redrado is forcing companies to improve disclosure and adopt
international accounting practices - a move that could reveal some companies
as far less healthy than their present accounts suggest. He also intends to
crack down on widespread market manipulation, by doubling his force of
inspectors to 30. Last week, in an unmistakable warning to the market, the
government suspended two financial companies for alleged tax and trading
offences.

FT  28 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): CAC-40 confounds sceptics as
it pierces 2,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTINENT remained in an optimistic mood yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
PARIS confounded the sceptics as the CAC-40 index broke above the 2,000
mark, albeit briefly, for the first time since July 20, 1990. The index
reached 2,004.18 but then dived to 1,972.77 due to the careless execution of
a medium-sized sell program by a leading domestic broker. Options-related
selling also pushed the market down. The index regained its composure to
close 3.81 higher at 1,985.12 in volume of FFr3.2bn.
Generale des Eaux was one of the day's most active stocks as Ferri put
through a block of 30,000 shares, from domestic to foreign hands. The stock
eased FFr4 to FFr2,253 with 83,940 shares traded.
LVMH was one of the stocks badly hit by the sell program, falling as low as
FFr4,540 before closing down FFr20 at FFr4,600.
UAP, the insurer, was up FFr18 at FFr581 but dealers could find no
particular reasons for the rise, while Total eased FFr4 to FFr248.
FRANKFURT continued to gain on buying by UK fund managers who were nervous
about their underweight position in German equities. The DAX index closed
12.63 higher at 1,749.90, while the FAZ index, calculated at mid-session,
rose 4.47 to 708.76. Turnover rose to DM8.5bn from DM7.6bn.
Dealers expected the market to consolidate at current levels during the
Carnival festivities next week but were confident that the DAX index could
break above 1,800 when trading returned to normal.
Blue-chips were sought after, with Daimler-Benz, which has lagged behind the
market, adding DM11.60 to DM761.80. BMW put on DM8 to DM566.50.
Smaller stocks continued to be active. The retailer Kaufhof added DM9.50 to
DM514.50 after the company surprised the market with the forecast that 1991
group earnings will rise faster than the 22 per cent increase in group sales
last year.
The steel and engineering group Klockner-Werke was 30 pfg better at
DM124.80. After the close it announced that it was passing the dividend on
1990/91 results, due to a sharp drop in earnings. Sector analysts said the
decision came as no surprise.
AMSTERDAM was dominated by Philips' results and the announcement from KLM
that merger talks with British Airways had been called off. The CBS Tendency
Index closed up 0.2 at 126.6.
Philips reported a 1991 net profit of Fl 981m, exceeding analysts forecasts
which had been in the Fl 650m range. There was strong US buying in the
afternoon and the shares finished up Fl 3.20 or nearly 10 per cent, to Fl
35.60.
KLM's announcement took the market by surprise, although one analyst
commented that a merger was beginning to look unlikely as neither side had
seemed prepared to agree on the share structure. The Dutch carrier closed
down Fl 2.10 or 5.2 per cent at Fl 38.20.
MADRID opened strongly after the treasury cut bond yields in its latest
tender, but fell back later. The general index closed at the year's high, up
2.34 at 264.68 in volume estimated at Pta20bn. Repsol, which reported a 3.6
per cent increase in 1991 net profit, gained Pta25 to Pta3,005. Valderrivas,
the construction group, rose Pta560 or 4 per cent to Pta14,400 after
announcing a 10.7 per cent rise in 1991 net profit.
MILAN again failed to hold on to early gains, the Comit index closing 2.24
lower at 540.50. Technical problems on the telematico screen-based trading
system also hindered trading. Turnover was estimated at L110bn after
Wednesday's L112.9bn.
Industrials were firmer with Fiat gaining L15 to L5,146 and Montedison
rising L20 to L1,430.
Selling pressure pushed the food group SME down by L70 to L3,350 on fears
that it would be forced to buy the Standa department store group from Mr
Silvio Berlusconi.
STOCKHOLM rose on overnight gains on Wall Street and the Affarsvarlden
General Index closed up 8.1 at 935.4 in turnover of SKr503m. Astra free
shares, which had risen SKr8 in early trading, fell back on profit-taking to
close up SKr2 at SKr579.
BELGIAN followed Wall Street and Frankfurt higher and the Bel-20 index
closed up 7.93 at 1,205.92. Solvay, the chemical group, rose BFr175 to
BFr12,550, while Petrofina, the oil group, gained BFr75 to BFr10,550.
ZURICH rose in quiet trading although investors remained cautious: the SPI
index rose 1.8 to 1,143.6. Alusuisse bearers fell SFr20 to SFr950 on
profit-taking after recent strong gains. Oerlikon-Buehrle bearers reversed
earlier gains to close down SFr6 at SFr380.
OSLO was lifted by firmer prices for North Sea oil and the all-share index
closed up 5.31 or 1.3 per cent to 414.28 in turnover of some NKr200m. Norsk
Hydro rose NKr1.5 to NKr137.5 helped by the stronger oil prices.
ISTANBUL fell 104 points in early trading before strong buying in the
banking sector and a weaker dollar pushed the index sharply higher: the

FT  28 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses early gain
on index-linked selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE OVERNIGHT rise on Wall Street and higher bond prices lifted share prices
initially, but index-linked selling in the afternoon sent the Nikkei average
down, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei ended 31.07 lower at 21,333.70 after hitting the day's high of
21,376.69 in the morning and low of 20,940.07 in the afternoon.
Volume rose to 220m shares from 200m as some individual investors bought
pharmaceutical and food stocks. Overall rises still led declines by 479 to
451, with 190 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
finished a slight 1.64 up at 1,553.65, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
was 0.06 firmer at 1,186.69.
Traders said that in spite of the retreat by share prices, sentiment
remained firm. 'The market had a lot working against it, but showed
stability,' commented Mr Chris Newton at James Capel.
Sentiment was unaffected by a further batch of negative earnings reports
from companies, the continuing investigation of a political bribery scandal
and reports that the Ministry of Finance is investigating the practice
whereby brokerage houses reshuffle clients' investment losses.
Traders said that technically the Nikkei was oversold: it is 20.9 per cent
below its five-year moving average, the lowest level since 1965 when the
average stood 23.7 per cent below the five-year line.
A call by Mr Shin Kanemaru, vice-president of the leading Liberal Democratic
Party, for a cut in the discount rate gave some optimism to the market. In a
speech given to the Takeshita faction of the LDP, he hinted that if Mr
Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, did not cut rates soon,
the government had the power to fire him.
Companies which had announced new developments in Aids-related drugs or
potential cures for cancer attracted short-term traders. Mochida
Pharmaceutical, the most active issue of the day, surged Y290 to Y2,920 and
Nippon Mining, which was reported to have developed an anti-Aids drug with
Japanese and US researchers, forged ahead Y31 to Y490.
Orix, the leasing company, fell Y130 to Y2,380 on foreign selling. Investors
were discouraged by an estimated 30 per cent decline in pre-tax profits for
the current year to March.
Brokerage houses remained weak on concern about the official investigation
into the practice of helping some clients' accounts by selling off
loss-carrying investments to other investors. Daiwa Securities fell Y21 to
Y930 and Nomura Securities lost Y10 to Y1,480.
In Osaka, the OSE average advanced 134.84 to 22,969.59 in volume of 68.7m
shares.
Roundup
HONG KONG closed at its second consecutive record high, but elsewhere on the
Pacific Rim sentiment was mixed.
HONG KONG took confidence from better than expected results from the
Australian division of Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking, lending weight to
forecasts that the bank was showing signs of recovery. The Hang Seng index
climbed 100.42 or 2.1 per cent to 4,895.13 in turnover of HKDollars 3.7bn,
against HKDollars 2.8bn.
HSBC Holdings, parent company of the bank, was the most active stock and
finished HKDollars 2.50 higher at HKDollars 42.25.
SEOUL ended three days of declines as the composite index closed 2.94 firmer
at 624.36 in turnover of Won262.9bn.
TAIWAN climbed sharply in early trading but turned back later, the weighted
index closing a net 67.72 or 1.4 per cent up at 5,019.22 after turnover of
TDollars 37.5bn.
MANILA lacked specific direction and the composite index gained 7.63 at
1,201.11 in turnover of 174m pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR retreated in the afternoon as profits were taken and the
composite index closed down 2.50 at 600.66 in volume of 42.7m shares.
Berjaya Leisure rose 14 cents to MDollars 2.16 after announcing plans to buy
two island resort firms.
SINGAPORE lost ground in quiet trade, the Straits Times Industrial index
falling 12.51 to 1,471.91 in turnover of SDollars 117.7m.
BANGKOK dropped to its lowest level since last August, the SET index ending
19.79 or 2.5 per cent off at 780.18. Bangkok Land lost Bt13 to Bt189 in
turnover of Bt1.19bn, the largest fall since its listing on February 5.
Bangkok Bank shed Bt4 to Bt704 in active trade.
AUSTRALIA was unmoved by the government's economic statement but fell on
profit-taking. The All Ordinaries index finished down 14.9 at 1,623.2 in
turnover of ADollars 280m.
Brambles Industries, the transport group, slipped 40 cents to ADollars 16.80
after announcing a 13 per cent fall in interim profits, while Comalco, the
aluminium producer, shed 3 cents to ADollars 3.87 on reporting an 85 per
cent drop in annual net profits.
NEW ZEALAND closed easier in moderate volume: the NZSE-40 index dipped 5.76
to 1,495.11. Air New Zealand declined 5 cents to NZDollars 1.77 on news of
further deregulation in air routes between Australia and New Zealand.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Trading in limbo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UNCERTAINTY continued to dog the UK money market yesterday, with trading
quiet and volumes low.
'We are in a sort of limbo period,' said one trader. 'What happens next is
anybody's guess. But the Bank of England is playing with a totally straight
bat, and seems to be saying the 10 1/2 per cent base rate is here to stay.'
Sterling interbank rates firmed slightly, with dealers feeling the UK had
passed up its best chance of a rate cut before the Budget on March 10 when
the Bank of Spain cut its key money market rate on Tuesday by 25 basis
points to 12.40 per cent.
The key three-month interbank rate opened  1/32 higher at 10 5/16-10 1/4 per
cent and later strengthened slightly to 10 3/8-10 1/4 per cent.
The March short sterling contract opened one basis point higher at 89.87,
but later dropped to 89.85.
Overnight rates went as high as 12-10 per cent in the early afternoon before
the market showed any interest, dropping back later to 11 1/4-11 1/8 per
cent, compared with 10 11/16-10 9/16 per cent on Wednesday.
The Bank of England initially forecast a shortfall of around Pounds 1.2bn,
slightly higher than expected, owing largely to treasury bills and maturing
assistance of Pounds 510m, and bills for repurchase by the market worth
Pounds 692m.
The Bank did not operate on the market on the early round, but later revised
its forecast upwards to Pounds 1.3bn, and purchased bills totalling Pounds
203m. These were Pounds 100m of band 1 treasury bills purchased outright at
10 3/8 per cent, and Pounds 23m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent,
together with Pounds 80m for resale to the market in equal amounts on March
17 and 18 at 10 7/16 per cent.
The forecast rose again in the afternoon to Pounds 1.4bn, and the Bank
purchased a further Pounds 841m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent and
Pounds 12m of band 2 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. The Bank provided late
assistance of around Pounds 310m.
German call money rates were steady and traders said sufficient end-month
liquidity meant rates were more likely to ease than to firm. Overnight rates
were at 9.45/55 per cent, unchanged from Wednesday.
In the US, the Federal Reserve drained reserves from the banking system
through overnight matched sale purchase agreements. Federal funds were
trading at 3 7/8 per cent at the Fed's operations time, slightly below the
Fed's presumed 4 per cent target.

FT  28 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: Tax avoidance scheme is effective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FITZWILLIAM (COUNTESS) AND OTHERS v INLAND REVENUE COMMISSIONERS
Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Nourse, Lord Justice Staughton and Sir
Christopher Slade): February 19 1992
STEPS TAKEN in a scheme to avoid capital transfer tax are not preordained
and do not constitute a single composite transaction so as to defeat their
object if there is a real possibility that the scheme may not go through in
that, before entering on one of the steps, a participant seeks separate
legal advice which may result in her putting forward fresh proposals.
The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by the Inland Revenue
from Mr Justice Vinelott's judgment quashing their decision that, by
application of the Ramsay principle, capital transfer tax (CTT) was payable
by virtue of a series of transactions affecting the estate of the 10th and
last Earl Fitzwilliam, who died in 1979.
LORD JUSTICE NOURSE said that by his will the trustees of the Earl's
residuary estate had power for 23 months after his death to appoint capital
or income in favour of beneficiaries including his widow, Lady Fitzwilliam,
and her daughter, Lady Hastings.
At the end of 23 months the trustees were directed to pay the income to Lady
Fitzwilliam during her life, with power to pay capital at their discretion,
with an ultimate trust in favour of Lady Hastings.
The 10th Earl died on September 23 1979 aged 75. Lady Fitzwilliam was 81.
The net value of the estate was just over Pounds 12.4m.
If Lady Fitzwilliam died within 23 months the whole of the residuary estate
would attract 75 per cent CTT on the Earl's death. If she took an interest
in possession, duty would be payable on her death and would not be
significantly less than 75 per cent.
The trustees instructed their solicitors, Currey &amp; Co, to explore all
possible ways of avoiding the prospective liability.
Five successive steps were ultimately taken:
Step 1 - On December 20 1979 the trustees appointed that Pounds 4m be held
in trust for Lady Fitzwilliam absolutely.
Step 2 - On January 7 1980 Lady Fitzwilliam drew a cheque for Pounds 2m,
post-dated January 9, in favour of Lady Hastings. The Pounds 2m was raised
by loan appropriated to Lady Fitzwilliam's Pounds 4m appointment. The
cheque, and a letter signed by Lady Fitzwilliam stating that the Pounds 2m
was a gift free of CTT, were handed to Lady Hastings by Currey on January 9.
Step 3 - On January 14 the trustees appointed that Pounds 3.8m be held upon
trust to pay the income to Lady Fitzwilliam until the earlier of February 15
1980 or her death; subject to one moiety in trust for Lady Hastings
absolutely and the other in trust for Lady Hastings contingently on her
being alive at date of determination of the income interest.
Step 4 - On January 31 Lady Fitzwilliam, in consideration of Pounds 2m,
assigned Lady Hastings her interest in the income of the contingent moiety.
Step 5 - On February 5 Lady Hastings settled Pounds 1,000 on trust to pay
the income thereof to Lady Fitzwilliam until her death or March 15 1980, and
subject thereto, on trust as to both capital and income for Lady Hastings
absolutely. On February 7 Lady Hastings assigned her reversionary interest
in the vested moiety to the trustees to be held by them as an addition to
her settlement.
If Mr Justice Vinelott's decision stood, CTT at a very high rate on assets
worth Pounds 7.8m would have been avoided.
The Ramsay principle was drawn from the House of Lords decisions in Ramsay
(1982) AC 300, Burmah Oil (1982) STC 30, Furniss v Dawson (1984) AC 474 and
Craven v White (1989) AC 398.
In Furniss v Dawson (1984) AC, Lord Brightman said: 'There must be a
preordained series of transactions; or . . . one single composite
transaction.'
The taxpayers' primary argument was that the steps were not preordained and
did not make up a single composite transaction.
In Craven v White Lord Keith said that in ascertaining the legal effect of
the series of transactions, it was relevant to take into account that 'all
the steps in it were contractually agreed in advance or had been determined
on in advance by a guiding will'.
Lord Oliver said the concept of a 'single indivisible composite whole' might
be summed up by asking whether at the material time the whole was already
'cut and dried'.
He said one essential was that when the inserted step was entered into there
should be 'no practical likelihood' that the pre-planned events would not
take place. Lord Jauncey suggested 'no real likelihood' as the appropriate
test.
For many years prior to the Earl's death the partner in Currey who had
looked after his family affairs was Mr D G Bosanquet, assisted since 1970 by
his partner, Mr N R D Powell. By the time of the Earl's death Mr Powell had
taken over responsibility for his affairs generally. He was solely
responsible for all tax planning aspects. Mr Bosanquet continued to look
after Lady Fitzwilliam. From October 18 1979 Mr Powell instructed junior
counsel, Mr Robert Walker.
On about January 14 1980 another partner, Mr N W Smith, agreed to advise
Lady Hastings. On January 18 Mr Smith instructed Mr Mark Herbert of counsel
to advise Lady Hastings.
The Commissioners concluded that the five steps taken to implement the CTT
avoidance scheme satisfied the Ramsay conditions. That could only be
supported if participation of both Lady Fitzwilliam and Lady Hastings was at
the material time 'cut and dried'; or if they were, in Mr Justice Vinelott's
words, 'mere actors in a play reading a prepared script'.
The Commissioners found that Lady Fitzwilliam gave Currey carte blanche to
make all necessary tax arrangements. They said that Lady Hastings, unlike
her mother, had no difficulty understanding the advice given. On one matter
she took an active part in a discussion with Mr Smith on January 22 and
expressed some views of her own.
The Commissioners' findings demonstrated that Lady Hastings had both an
understanding and a will of her own. The inference that her participation
was on January 14 cut and dried, or that it was insupportable that she was a
mere actor in a play reading a prepared script.
It was enough for the taxpayers' purposes that the inference should be
rejected in the case of Lady Hastings alone.
The Crown argued that there was a preordained scheme as from January 3 when
Mr Walker dictated the necessary steps and a timetable for them over the
telephone to Mr Powell.
In the very breath in which he had dictated the steps and the timetable,
counsel had suggested that serious consideration be given to Lady Hastings
being advised by another partner and possibly by separate counsel.
That suggestion was followed within the fortnight. Different proposals might
have been put forward on her side.
None of the tests for preordainment expressed in Craven v White was
satisfied.
There was no 'guiding will'. Lady Hastings's participation was not 'cut and
dried'. It could not have been said that there was no 'practical' or 'real'
likelihood that the scheme would not be completed.
The Commissioners found that Mr Powell's intention to implement the scheme
at each step must be attributed to Lady Hastings.
Mr Powell's 'intention' to implement the scheme was qualified by the
suggestion, apparently acted on by January 14, that Lady Hastings should
receive separate advice, and by a consequential recognition of a real
possibility that the scheme proposed would not go through.
Such a qualification was fatal to application of the Ramsay principle.
Accordingly, on January 14, when step 3 was taken, it was not preordained
that Lady Hastings would participate in steps 4 and 5.
Even as a single composite transaction none of the steps would have produced
the fiscal results for which the Crown contended. The CTT legislation did
not apply to any of the composite transactions contended for by the Crown.
The appeal was dismissed. Their Lordships gave concurring judgments.
For the taxpayers: Robert Walker QC and Mark Herbert (Currey &amp; Co).
For the Crown: Robert Reid QC and Christopher McCall QC (Inland Revenue
solicitor).

FT  28 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK fishermen face stringent
curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government is to introduce a scheme to decommission surplus
fishing boats at the cost of Pounds 25m and to cut Britain's fishing effort
to preserve stocks, writes James Buxton. The scheme is a significant U-turn
for the government, which has repeatedly argued that decommissioning would
be difficult to administer and open to abuse.
The government will pay to remove fishing boats from the fleet over two
years, with the European Community contributing 50 to 70 per cent of the
cost. Fish producers' organisations, which are made up of fishermen, will be
allowed to buy and sell fishing quotas and buy out members who want to leave
the industry.
Under new licensing arrangements, a reduction in capacity will be achieved
when licenses change hands, and licensing is to be extended to boats of
under 10 metres in length. There will be further reductions in the number of
days boats can spend at sea beginning in 1993.
Mr David Curry, fisheries minister, said yesterday: 'You need something of
this toughness if you really are going to tackle the problem of depleted
stocks'.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chips down for UK Potato Board
 -David Blackwell on a scheme that may fall foul of the single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK'S POTATO Marketing Board does not market potatoes. But it does aim to
control the supply of potatoes to the UK market under a system which does
not sit well with the principles of the Single European Market.
Potato growing has not yet been brought within the ambit of the European
Community's common agricultural policy, but the European Commission has to
bring forward a proposal soon to comply with the Single European Act - it
was expected to make an announcement a year ago. All predictions are for a
'light regime', which is highly unlikely to include any kind of quota system
or market support measures.
The PMB is lobbying hard to keep its supply side scheme, which it claims
works in the interests of everyone in the UK potato trade. The great
majority of growers favours the scheme. Amid the general talk of plummeting
incomes at the recent Oxford Farming Conference, one potato grower was
overheard to say that he had just completed his best year ever in farming
after paying Pounds 30,000 in levies to the PMB.
But the Potato Processors Association, whose members purchase about 25 per
cent of the UK crop, is lobbying equally hard against the PMB scheme. The
association says it boosts the costs of its members products - such as
frozen chips and crisps - and makes them less competitive than producers on
the continent.
No-one in the UK can grow potatoes on more than 0.4 hectares (or one acre)
unless they have acquired 'basic area' from the PMB. Any new grower gets 0.5
hectares on application and can build on that or purchase or lease basic
producer. Mr Alasdair Fairbairn, the PMB chief executive, says there is a
'very dynamic market in basic area', both for leasing and purchasing.
Growers with basic area pay a levy of Pounds 85.60 a hectare. If they grow
too few potatoes they lose some of their basic area the following year; they
are entitled to grow excess potatoes, but then must pay ten times the normal
levy.
The 'target area,' which determines the amount of potatoes grown in the UK,
is set about 18 months in advance of the growing season by a joint
consultative committee. The committee comprises grower organisations, unions
and co-ops, and representatives along the supply chain, including merchants,
retailers and consumer organisations. It has an independent chairman.
The committee looks at the requirement of the total market, including
exports, before setting the target area - 154,000 hectares this year.
Mr Fairbairn says that the system means that beyond the farm gate there is a
totally free market in the UK, and points out that there are no restrictions
on imports.
'We have a terrific system. Prices are market driven. The levy itself at
retail level is equal to one-tenth of a penny per lb. This enables us to
fund collective advertising, promotion and research and development.'
The PMB, which had an income of Pounds 13m last year, wants to maintain a
system which it says costs the taxpayer nothing and gives a co-ordinated
approach to the industry.
Critics of the scheme point out that it dates from the 1930s when there was
no potato processing industry. Now a third of potatoes consumed in the UK
are in processed form in a market worth Pounds 1.5bn a year. However, only
25 per cent of the UK crop is processed - the difference is made up by
imports worth up to Pounds 150m a year, according to the PPA.
Potatoes make up about 50 per cent of the cost of frozen chips and
dehydrated products and 25 per cent of the cost of crisps.
Mr Richard Harris, chairman of the PPA, believes UK processors are paying
more for potatoes, putting them at a disadvantage to those in continental
Europe. 'You don't have to be an accountant to know that if half the
production costs are higher it has a heck of an effect on profitability.'
He claims the PMB is exporting both potato acreage and processing capacity,
with consequent effects on the balance of payments. He points out that the
cost of transporting potatoes across the channel is Pounds 30 to Pounds 35 a
tonne, compared with a price of only Pounds 90 a tonne. 'The UK market has
that protection. I don't see the need for this protectionist system.'
The PMB, however, believes the system is leading to greater efficiency in
the UK market. Mr Fairbairn says the number of growers has fallen from
45,000 in 1970 to 17,000 in 1990 as production becomes concentrated in the
hands of serious professional growers who are on the right soil types and
have invested heavily in mechanisation. Yields have also risen steadily, Mr
Fairbairn says.
He thinks the PMB growers would survive in a free-for-all. But there is
overwhelming support to retain the system of collective forecasting and
balancing in order to avoid swings in price that the PMB believes could
damage the heavy per capita consumption of fresh potatoes achieved in the
UK.
The European Commission is apparently still a long way from a decision on
potatoes. While a lightweight regime is generally expected, it is 'not a
foregone conclusion that the PMB will be abolished,' according to one
official.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: MacSharry stresses need for CAP
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S farm policy has to be reformed with or without a settlement in the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Mr Ray MacSharry, the agriculture
commissioner, said yesterday.
Against a background of overproduction, a limited EC budget and declining
farm incomes, reform of the Common Agricultural Policy has become a priority
for the European Commission, Mr MacSharry told the annual Agra Europe
conference on the outlook for European agriculture in London. 'The
negotiations so far have been slow and difficult. But I believe that
ministers are now coming to the view that they can no longer delay decisions
that their farming communities expect, indeed demand of them now.'
He denied that the EC proposals, which would reduce price support for farm
production, would damage 'the so-called commercial sector of agriculture'.
But the EC would also not allow the decline of rural communities in
'situations where there is no viable alternative to agriculture'.
Uncertainty over Gatt had caused hesitation in states that recognised the
need for reform and afforded delay to the less convinced. But Mr MacSharry
was hopeful that a deal would be reached this year. Failure would be very
costly, he said. 'I firmly believe that the future lies in freer trade and
that failure to continually advance on this front creates a serious risk of
a return to protectionist tendencies.'

FT  28 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chile's giant copper mine to
boost production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LA ESCONDIDA, the giant copper mine in the Atacama desert owned by BHP of
Australia, RTZ and a group of Japanese smelters, plans to step up its annual
production by 25 per cent and process the extra 80,000 tonnes into pure
copper cathodes using a revolutionary technique that does not require
smelting.
Mr John Hannah, La Escondida's president, said the open-cast mine would
continue producing copper concentrates, a semi-refined product, to meet
long-term contracts with smelters in Japan and Europe. La Escondida
currently produces the equivalent of 320,000 tonnes of pure copper a year in
the form of concentrates. It is the second-biggest copper mine in the world
after Chuquicamata, also in Chile.
Mr Hannah said the feasibility study for the extra output would be completed
by mid-year. 'If the study shows that the expansion is commercially viable,
construction could start as early as September,' he said at a news
conference in Santiago. La Escondida's expansion plans, which come just 15
months after the mine became operative, will require an investment of
Dollars 200m. It will be financed from the company's cash-flows, Mr Hannah
said.
The company is testing its innovative method to obtain refined copper at a
pilot plant beside Coloso, its loading port just south of Antofagasta. It is
a hydrometallurgical process that dissolves the copper concentrate in a
solution with ammonia. An electric current is then passed through the
solution, which causes the copper to precipitate.
Mr Hannah said the cathode plant was a non-polluting alternative to
conventional smelting and refining. It will also be much cheaper than having
to build a smelter. La Escondida decided to embark on the production of
refined copper, he said, because it was a more marketable commodity than
copper concentrates.
If all goes to plan, the cathode plant could be ready by mid-1994. Mr Hannah
believes it will be the only plant of its kind in the world. La Escondida is
in the process of patenting its new technique.
At the mine itself, located 180 km (110 miles) south-east of Antofagasta,
the capacity of the concentrating plant will have to be expanded to deal
with the extra output. Negotiations are also under way with power generating
companies in northern Chile to ensure the supply of extra electricity for
the cathode plant.
The expansion plans do not come as a surprise. The mine sits on the richest
copper deposit in the world. Its geological reserves of 1.8bn tonnes could
keep it productive well into the 22nd century. The ore is also very rich in
copper, which allows La Escondida to have one of the lowest production costs
in the world.
Management and union leaders at El Teniente, the troubled copper mine owned
by Codelco, the Chilean Copper Corporation, were meeting yesterday in an
attempt to break the impasse over an unpopular redundancy scheme. Work has
returned to normal after Monday's wildcat strikes, but copper workers are
threatening more protest actions unless 100 colleagues who were sacked at
the weekend are reinstated.
Codelco says it needs to shed 800 jobs at El Teniente to reduce overmanning.
It currently employs 9,400 workers at its second-largest division, which
last year produced 278,765 tonnes of copper, about a quarter of Codelco's
total output. The corporation said yesterday that production costs had
almost doubled in six years - it now cost 75 US cents to produce a lb of
copper. El Teniente's future was in jeopardy unless it succeeded in
streamlining the operation now.
Union leaders, meanwhile, have called for an 'emergency congress' of the
Copper Workers Union to discuss the threat of redundancies and a
controversial law that will allow Codelco to sell surplus mining property
and form joint ventures with private mining companies. In the minds of
copper miners, these two issues are linked.

Gold rose on the London bullion market after Comex opened higher as
buy-stops were triggered by local traders. 'It's a typical short covering
rally in a bear market. . . I think the range for the year has been Dollars
348 - Dollars 360 and that says it all really,' one London dealer said. The
market remains wary of the approach of the Islamic month of Ramadan from
March 5, during which period average gold prices have exceeded those of the
preceding month only once in the past seven years, UBS analyst Andy Smith
said. But this time round gold is entering Ramadan at the lowest levels
since 1986. Average prices in the month following Ramadan have usually also
been lower in the past seven years. At the London Metal Exchange copper and
aluminium prices eased back from their highs during late trading amid
reports that Russia had cancelled duties on metal exports. There was no
confirmation, but after the exchange closed a government adviser, speaking
in Moscow, said some Russian companies were receiving tax breaks. At the
close cash copper was Pounds 1,298.75 a tonne, up Pounds 7.25 on the day,
while cash aluminium was down Dollars 4 at Dollars 1,318.50 a tonne. The May
robusta coffee price ended Dollars 11 higher at Dollars 813 a tonne on
short-covering.

FT  28 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Guinness raises Dollars 200m to repay
short-term debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS, the UK drinks and leisure group, yesterday raised Dollars 200m
three-year funding in the international bond market, using the proceeds of
the issue to repay short-term debt.
Lead managed by J. P. Morgan Securities, the 6 1/2 per cent bonds were
re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.85, where the yield spread
over US Treasury bonds was 60 basis points.
Many participants in the deal reported good demand for the bonds at this
level from buyers anticipating an appreciation by the US currency on the
foreign exchange markets.
However, when the deal was allowed to trade freely by the lead manager, the
price of the bonds slipped back to 99.75 and the yield spread widened to
around 65 basis points.
Most of this lost ground was later recovered as unsold paper was mopped up
by firms with better demand, but the softness of the price in the early
stages was seen as hampering the progress of the deal. By the close of
trading the deal was quoted at 99.82 bid.
The payment date on the bonds is April 6, more than five weeks after the
launch date and longer than normal in the Euromarket. This was seen as
deterring some institutional investors from buying the bonds, but may have
helped Guinness achieve a better swap rate and a lower cost of funds. The
proceeds were swapped into floating rate dollars.
Elsewhere, New Brunswick, one of the less frequent visitors to the
international bond market among Canadian provinces, had a mixed reception to
a CDollars 200m 10-year deal launched via Merrill Lynch.
The bonds carry a coupon of 9 1/4 per cent and were re-offered to investors
at a fixed price of 99.86, for a yield 73 basis points more than Canadian
government paper.
The pricing was seen as aggressive by many participants in the deal. Bonds
issued by Ontario, which has a credit rating two notches above New
Brunswick, trade at a yield spread of 74 basis points over government bonds.
Against this, bonds issued by New Brunswick have rarity value and many
participants in the deal anticipated good retail buying for the bonds. The
deal was held at the fixed re-offer price throughout the day.

<TEXT>
THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange's first non-dollar denominated cross rate
contract, on DM/Y futures and futures-options, lifted off smoothly on
Wednesday and gathered pace yester-day.
On the first day of trading, the yen-settled DM/Y contract reached a volume
of 212 futures and 655 options on futures. By mid-morning yesterday in
Chicago, the contract's trading volume was ticking over at 198 futures and
500 options.
Mr Jack Sandner, CME chairman, said at the inauguration of the new
non-dollar cross rates contract: 'We've realised that the dollar is no
longer the centre of the universe.'
Last year, the CME's effort to raise interest in a series of dollar
denominated cross rate products failed. But the new DM/Y cross rate appears
to have a more positive reception. It provides, for example, some arbitrage
opportunities with the cash market D-Mark/yen options offered at the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange.
The CME has also gathered a group of powerful trading houses to act as
market makers under its market incentive programme, which aims to increase
liquidity in fledgling contracts.

SKAUGEN, one of Norway's biggest shipowners, has made a pre-tax loss of
NKr170m (Dollars 26.5m) for 1991, against a profit of NKr68m in 1990. Behind
the reversal was lower chartering rates for ships and weaker markets, the
group said.
Skaugen made an operating loss of NKr95m, compared with a profit of NKr125m.
Gross freight income slipped to NKr2.348bn in 1991 from NKr2.383bn in 1990.
Skaugen said a NKr50m charge was made against 1991 accounts to cover
restructuring. The company reduced its fleet during the year to 52 ships
from 85.
In all, 12 ships were sold last year and another one sold this year. Skaugen
owns 22 ships and operates 30 under contract.
'The result for 1991 is not satisfactory,' said Mr Erik Gloeersen, managing
director. He said 1992 would be a difficult year with lower earnings in
several of the company's ship divisions.
'We expect an improvement in other areas,' he said.

SAN MIGUEL Corporation, the Philippines' largest industrial enterprise,
yesterday reported consolidated net profits for 1991 of 2.81bn pesos
(Dollars 116m), an increase of 57 per cent from the previous year.
Turnover expanded by 22 per cent in value to 53.3bn pesos despite a decline
in sales of many of the beer-and-food company's products.
Sales of beer, which usually account for about 60 per cent of San Miguel's
annual turnover, declined in line with consumer demand in the general
economic slowdown in the country.
Earnings per share rose to 5.20 pesos from 3.32 pesos in 1990. The board of
directors yesterday proposed a 10 per cent dividend, to be presented for
approval at the annual shareholders' meeting on April 21.
The company views 1992 with 'cautious optimism'. Its expansion programme has
put on stream additional capacity in its beer, ice cream and soft drinks
production.
The 1991 profits growth reversed a 26 per cent decline in 1990 owing to a
sharp increase in operating costs, particularly interest payments. The 1991
profits growth rate was also the highest since 1987.
However, non-recurring income contributed substantially to the big rise in
profits. The bulk came from the swap of the company's shares in San Miguel
Brewery in Hong Kong with new shares, corresponding to a 12 per cent
interest, in SHK Hong Kong Industries, which specialises in investing in
leading industrial corporations in Hong Kong and Macao.
The higher profits were also the result of improved margins and operating
efficiency. Since 1990, the company has been undertaking cost-cutting
initiatives, including reducing staff and making prepayments of foreign
currency loans to take advantage of discounts.

REEMTSMA, the privately-owned German tobacco company, is to acquire
Hungary's Debrecen Tobacco Factory, the Hungarian privatisation agency
announced yesterday.
The German concern beat three western rivals to take a stake of almost 85
per cent in Debrecen for an undisclosed sum.
Reemtsma plans to supplement Debrecen's Symphonia brand, whose 35 per cent
market share makes it Hungary's second-ranking cigarette, with some of its
own products, which include the West brand.
The move follows purchases in eastern Germany and Slovenia. It also
completes the privatisation of Hungary's state-owned tobacco industry by
Merrill Lynch, the US brokerage.
In quick succession, British American Tobacco and Philip Morris, the UK and
US tobacco multinationals, recently took control of their Hungarian
licensees' plants.
Merrill Lynch is also involved in the sale of a majority shareholding in
Vegetable Oil Company, one of Hungary's top 10 industrial companies by
sales. Announcement of the buyer is expected next week. It is understood
that the deal would be worth more than Dollars 100m.

THE Austrian futures and options exchange, OTOB, is launching options on

The OTOB said the company's shares would be the sixth in Austria on which
call and put options could be bought or written. They would be launched on

Options are available on the OTOB on Creditanstalt-Bankverein preferred
shares and ordinary shares in EVN, the utility, Lenzing, the textile and
chemical group, OMV, the oil group and Wienerberger, the building group.
The OTOB said it also planned to launch options on the real-time Austrian

second half of the year it would introduce interest futures on a synthetic
Austrian bund government bond.
It said the new market had developed more rapidly than expected since its

<TEXT>
ANGLOVAAL Industries (AVI), the holding company for the industrial interests
of the Anglovaal group, did well to increase earnings by 18 per cent in the
six months to the end of December against the background of very weak
economic conditions.
Turnover rose by 8 per cent to R3.96bn (Dollars 1.38bn), but tighter margins
saw profit before interest and tax restricted to a 3 per cent increase to
R368.1m. A decline in profit attributable to outside shareholders helped
lift earnings by 18 per cent to R121.5m. Earnings per share rose by 17 per
cent to 425 cents.
The results compare favourably with other large industrial groupings to have
reported recently, arguably under easier conditions. The share has enjoyed a
significant upward re-rating in recent months, from a low of R70 last year
to its current level of about R130.
Favourable share ratings formed the basis for AVI and two of its
subsidiaries recently raising R785m through rights issues.
The largest contributions to earnings came from Consol, the packaging and
rubber company, and National Brands, which is involved in branded,
fast-selling consumer goods. Their respective contributions were 27 and 28
per cent.
AVI Diversified Holdings, whose main activities are textiles and
engineering, and Irvin &amp; Johnson, the frozen products group, contributed 21
and 20 per cent respectively.
The only laggard was Grinaker Holdings, the technology, electronics and
construction company, which contributed only 3 per cent to earnings despite
accounting for 25 per cent of group turnover.
The directors expect earnings for the full year to exceed those of the
previous year.

BRIDGESTONE, the Japanese tyre-maker, reported a 15.9 per cent fall in
pre-tax profit to Y76.6bn (Dollars 590m) in the year to end December.
However, the company forecast that much of those earnings would be erased in
its consolidated accounts by the continuing cost of digesting Firestone Tire
and Rubber, its US acquisition of four years ago.
While the company is yet to finalise its consolidated accounts, Bridgestone
indicated that group after-tax profit would total Y7.4bn, a 66 per cent
increase on last year, but well below the parent company's after-tax profit,
which rose 21 per cent to Y62.9bn.
'It is difficult to say how much of that difference is directly related to
restructuring Firestone, but we estimate that there is a net loss of about
Dollars 500m for the overseas operations,' a Bridgestone spokesman said.
The company is hoping that its US subsidiary, Bridgestone/Firestone, will
report a profit this year, but is relying on a recovery in the US economy,
and particularly in the car market, to fuel sales.
Parent sales for the year to end December rose 1.7 per cent to Y736.48bn,
with domestic sales rising 8 per cent to Y551.3bn, despite a downturn in the
Japanese car industry last year, while exports fell 14 per cent to
Y185.18bn.
Tyre sales, which account for 74 per cent of the total, fell 1 per cent, but
sales of diversified products, including industrial rubber, chemicals, and
sporting goods, rose 10 per cent to Y194.38bn.
The company said tougher competition was expected in the coming year, as the
international economy is weak and domestic economic growth has turned down.
It said these conditions would mean that extra emphasis will be needed on
the development of new technology and products.
For the year to end December, the parent is expecting a 2 per cent increase
in sales to Y750bn, and that after-tax earnings will fall to Y40bn.

big losses

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMALCO and Pasminco, two of Australia's biggest mining companies, yesterday
reported big losses caused by falling metal prices and provisions against
falling asset values.
Pasminco shares were also hit by an announcement that North Broken Hill Peko
and CRA each plan to reduce their 40 per cent shareholdings in the company
to 19 per cent.
There was better news for the mining sector from Renison Goldfields, the
world's largest mineral sands producer, which announced a 20 per cent rise
in first-half net profits to ADollars 33m (USDollars 25m), due to higher
production at the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea.
However, Renison said second-half earnings would be 'well below' the first
half because of lower gold grades at Porgera and losses on sales of
stockpiled mineral sands.
Comalco, a 67 per cent subsidiary of CRA, blamed lower aluminium prices for
an 87 per cent fall in net profits to ADollars 21.5m for the year to
December. Sales revenue was down from ADollars 2.1bn to ADollars 2bn.
The company made a net loss of ADollars 72.2m after accounting for a net
extraordinary loss of ADollars 25.7m, comprising a write-off of ADollars
200m against the carrying value of downstream businesses, offset by a
transfer of ADollars 174.3m from the superannuation fund.
Mr Nick Stump, chief executive, said aluminium prices had fallen to their
lowest-ever level in real terms during the period. Prices had risen
recently, but the company was not confident that the improvement could be
sustained.
Mr Stump said Comalco was still considering expansion of its operations at
Bell Bay and Boyne Island in Australia, and Tiwai Point in New Zealand, but
would go ahead only if market conditions and power costs allowed.
Comalco declared a final dividend of 2 cents, fully franked, compared with
10 cents last year. The total dividend is 4 cents, compared with 18 cents in
the previous period.
Pasminco said it lost ADollars 34.2m after tax in the six months to
December, compared with a profit of ADollars 6.4m in the corresponding
period of 1990. Turnover was down from ADollars 877m to ADollars 625m.
It said the loss increased to ADollars 118m after including abnormal losses
of ADollars 2.3m relating to redundancy costs and an extraordinary loss of
ADollars 81.5m relating to a write-down of its Elura mine, which is to be
sold.
Pasminco shares closed 13 cents lower at ADollars 1.41 on the Australian
Stock Exchange. The sale of shares was triggered by North Broken Hill Peko,
which wants to free capital for investment in projects such as its Kanowna
Belle gold mine in Western Australia.
CRA said it had followed North Broken Hill's lead because it did not want to
be forced to consolidate Pasminco in its accounts. The group said it also
wanted to concentrate on its iron ore, coal and aluminium operations.
Pasminco did not declare an interim dividend.
The company was formed in 1988 when North Broken Hill and CRA pooled their
zinc and lead mines, and smelters. CRA is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the
UK.

AMCOR, the Australian paper and packaging group, yesterday reported a 138
per cent rise in net profits to ADollars 190.7m (Dollars 142.8m) for the
first half to December from ADollars 80m a year earlier, Reuter reports from
Melbourne.
Amcor said the result was highly satisfactory given that Australia was in
serious recession. Sales rose to ADollars 2.3bn in the half from ADollars
2.26bn. Earnings per share rose to 22.5 cents from 16.7 cents,and the
dividend is being raised to 14 cents a sharefrom 13 cents.
The profit rise was due to substantial capital spending in recent years,
strict cost control, plant rationalisation and expansion into profitable
overseas operations.
An abnormal gain of ADollars 78.6m was mainly due to the sale of 22.5m Mayne
Nickless shares for ADollars 8.05 a share, which realised a profit for the
group of ADollars 77m.
Amcor said cash-flow for the period was well ahead of last year and it had
about ADollars 200m cash on deposit.
Amcor said it was reaping the benefits of a conservative approach to
offshore expansion and was confident of continued improvement in results
from its overseas subsidiaries.
Although demand was firm in some segments of Amcor's business, particularly
aluminium beverage cans and business papers, sales volumes in most other
product categories showed little change.
Sales for container packaging in Australia, New Zealand and Canada rose 8.1
per cent to ADollars 679m in the half, while sales for fibre packaging rose
14.2 per cent to ADollars 600m.
The company said it expected further good results in the second six months.
'Directors hope to continue the progress made to date and, given no further
deterioration in Australian economic conditions, we expect to achieve
further good results in the January-June period,' it said. 'Should economic
activity expand, Amcor is poised for a period of strong growth worldwide.'

ISCOR, South Africa's largest steel producer, saw earnings drop by 43 per
cent in the six months to the end of December as finance charges compounded
the effect of weak domestic and international markets.
Turnover rose by 15.6 per cent to R4.16bn (Dollars 1.45bn) on the back of a

by 7.2 per cent, exports were up by 20.6 per cent and contributed more than
half of the total, compared with 45 per cent in the same period in 1990.
Income before tax and finance charges declined by 9.6 per cent to R395m, a
function of weaker margins, particularly in the saturated international
market.
The results took a heavy knock, however, from finance charges, which doubled
to R218m from R108m in 1990. Mr Willem van Wyk, managing director, said this
was the result of a substantial increase in borrowings, necessary to
complete important spending projects, on account of lower than expected
revenues from iron and steel sales. Attributable earnings dropped by 43 per
cent to R171m.
Mr van Wyk said finance charges would be lower in future as the capital
expenditure programme was nearly complete.
Looking ahead for the balance of the financial year, Mr Marius de Waal,
chairman, said: 'There are no signs of recovery in the domestic market, and
it is expected that surplus capacity worldwide will continue to depress
dollar prices of steel for at least the balance of 1992.'
He said no improvement in the earnings trend was forecast. Against this
background, the dividend was cut by one-third to 3 cents a share on earnings
down to 9.2 cents from 16.1 cents per share.
Murray and Roberts, the engineering and construction group, lifted
attributable earnings by 29 per cent to R96.2m on a turnover of R2.65bn, in
the six months to the end of December, up from R2.24bn a year earlier.

BRAMBLES Industries, the Australian transport group, yesterday blamed lower
interest rates and economic uncertainty in Europe for a 13.2 per cent drop
in net profits to ADollars 88.7m (USDollars 66.4m) for the six months to
December. Sales were up from ADollars 1.189bn to ADollars 1.197bn.
Mr Gary Pemberton, chief executive, said the group expected a similar result
in the second half, implying full-year earnings of about ADollars 177m,
compared with ADollars 192m in the previous year.
The board declared a fully-franked dividend of 30 cents, up 5 cents on the
previous interim dividend, and announced it would reintroduce a discounted
dividend reinvestment plan for shareholders. Despite the move, Brambles
shares slipped 40 cents to ADollars 16.80 on the Australian Stock Exchange.
Mr Pemberton said the group suffered a fall of ADollars 15m before tax on
interest income from its cash holdings of about ADollars 500m. The trend is
expected to continue in the second half as a result of lower interest rates.
Brambles is also expected to reduce its cash deposits to finance the
USDollars 257m acquisition of Environmental Systems (Ensco), a US waste
management company. The acquisition is due to be completed in mid-March
unless it is halted by a legal challenge from some shareholders.
Mr Pemberton said the acquisition of Ensco would complete Brambles' planned
expansion of its operations to North America.
He said there were 'good grounds for confidence' in the long-term future of
Brambles' other US business, a pallet pool being established in a joint
venture with GKN of the UK.
Mr Pemberton said Brambles had suffered a 'softening' of performance in its
European operations. Trading had suffered from uncertainty in France and the
UK, but newly-acquired fork lift and heavy lift businesses were contributing
to profitability.
Results from its Australian businesses were marginally down on the
comparable period of the previous year, but were 'pleasing in the face of
domestic recession', Mr Pemberton said.

British cable TV expansion

<TEXT>
VIDEOTRON of Canada is seeking a third partner to help carry the growing
cost of its aggressive entry into the British cable TV market.
Mr Andre Chagnon, chairman of Videotron, who moved his communications group
into British cable TV three years ago, said France's Cie Generale des Eaux
was one of the potential investors, though he would give preference to a
British company.
Videotron, under pressure from the recession in its Canadian broadcasting
and cable TV business, owns 63 per cent of the British venture and wants to
reduce its stake to 51 per cent. BCE, which controls Bell Canada and
Northern Telecom, owns 30 per cent.
The British subsidiary, as an initial step, is investing about USDollars
150m in two licence areas in southern England. It will not become
self-supporting for at least another two years, said Mr Chagnon.
Though the investment per subscriber is higher than North America, cable
rates are more generous and British cable companies have the right to sell
telephone services and increase returns in the future.
The UK operation has about 50,000 cable subscribers and the market potential
is estimated at 1m. But to approach such a figure would require several
hundred million dollars more in investment.
National Sea Products, Canada's biggest fisheries company, posted a 1991
loss of CDollars 35.9m (USDollars 30m), or CDollars 1.70 a share, on sales
of CDollars 439m because of poor catches and lower processing volume. It
lost CDollars 2.2m, or 22 cents, on sales of CDollars 461m in 1990.
The company said the outlook for 1992 was uncertain because of the federal
government's plan to cut the northern cod quota from 185,000 tonnes to
120,000 tonnes to protect stocks. Northern cod makes up about one-quarter of
National Sea's annual landings.

<TEXT>
GE CAPITAL, the main financial services arm of General Electric, has
reinforced its expansion in Europe with an agreement in principle to buy the
vehicle leasing and fleet management business of Avis Europe, the car rental
company.
The business being sold is Avis Lease, and GE Capital will acquire the right
to use this name. The operation has assets of around Dollars 900m and some
120,000 vehicles in 14 European countries. GE Capital declined to say how
much it was paying.
Mr Alun Cathcart, chairman of Avis Europe, said its leasing business had
seen significant growth rates over the past five years and was expected to
enjoy similar expansion over the next several years. However, a company of
Avis Europe's size could not handle its likely requirements for future asset
finance.
Avis Europe, the continent's market leader in car rental, is a private
business owned 65 per cent by Lease International Belgium, 26 per cent by
General Motors of the US and 11 per cent by Avis Inc of the US.
GE Capital, the second largest non-bank financial services company in the
US, has been gradually expanding into Europe - primarily the UK - over the
past two years via acquisitions. It has bought private label credit card
businesses from Burton and House of Fraser and a consumer car finance
business from Barclays Bank.
However, this is the first European venture by GE Capital Fleet Services,
the largest corporate fleet management business in North America, with more
than 500,000 vehicles under lease or service management.
Ms Teresa LeGrand, president of GE Capital Fleet Services, said the
combination of the two companies would create the foundation for a global
vehicle leasing network.
Avis Lease employs around 1,000 people and its largest operations are in
Britain, France, Belgium, Italy and Spain. Mr Cathcart said it had a good
record of profits and in recent years had seen fleet growth of 15 to 20 per
cent in some markets.
Avis Europe was floated off from Avis Inc, its US parent, in a public
offering in London in 1986 but was taken private again in 1989.

TANDY, the US electronic products retailer, is to repurchase 12m shares, or
16 per cent of its outstanding shares, through a Dutch auction, AP-DJ
reports.
Shareholders will be invited to tender shares at prices not greater than
Dollars 32 nor less that Dollars 27 a share, and to specify at which price
they wish to tender.
Tandy will purchase 12m shares at a price within that range. The offer will
not be conditional on a minimum number of shares being tendered. The tender
offer will expire March 26 unless extended by Tandy.
The company said proceeds from the recent preferred equity redemption
cumulative stock (Percs) issue would be used to fund the repurchase.
The company said it was making the offer because it believed that, given
Tandy's business, assets and prospects and the current market price of the
shares, the purchase was an attractive investment.

<TEXT>
PWA Corporation, holding company of Canadian Airlines International,
yesterday announced a heavy 1991 loss, bringing the combined deficit of
Canada's two main airlines last year to almost CDollars 400m (USDollars
336m).
Mr Rhys Eyton, PWA's chairman, forecast another difficult year in 1992 and
confirmed outsiders' predictions that a restructuring of the beleaguered
industry was on the cards through rationalisation and alliances with foreign
airlines.
PWA's loss was CDollars 161.7m, or CDollars 3.66 a share, up from a CDollars
14.6m loss, or 60 cents, in 1990. Air Canada last week posted a 1991 loss of
CDollars 218m. The airline's fourth-quarter loss was CDollars 68.7m, up from
CDollars 34.2m a year earlier.
PWA's preferred route has been to find a strong equity partner among the
leading US airlines. The company has been rumoured to be in talks for
American Airlines to acquire a stake of up to 49 per cent.
But Air Canada has lobbied against greater foreign involvement and appears
to favour a merger or some other form of rationalisation involving the two
airlines.
The struggle between the two has intensified recently as each seeks to
ensure it emerges as the undisputed main carrier.
Air Canada has increased capacity on both domestic and international routes.
It has unsuccessfully tried to block a Canadian TV advertisement showing
passengers walking from an Air Canada cabin into a Canadian aircraft.
PWA's operating revenues rose by 4.6 per cent last year to CDollars 2.87bn.
The operating loss was CDollars 90.4m, compared with a 1990 loss of CDollars
11.7m.
Mr Eyton said that the company had yet to see firm evidence of a recovery.

REPSOL, Spain's state-controlled energy group, lifted its post-tax profits
last year by 4 per cent to Pta70.1bn (Dollars 680m) after setting aside
Pta12.6bn for items such as early retirements and plant closures.
The company said that the results were good in the light of its decision to
adopt a prudent accounting criteria.
This decision was in response to an uncertain international oil market, the
difficulties of the chemical industry and the development of a liberalised
energy market in Spain.
Operating income for 1991 increased by 16 per cent to Pta129bn, despite
sharply decreased earnings from the group's chemical interests where income
dropped by Pta24bn in 1990 to Pta1.2bn last year.
The company's policy is to pay out dividends of not less than 40 per cent of
profits and not more than 50 per cent.
It paid out 42 per cent of its 1990 profits, returning Pta95 per share.
It has already paid an interim dividend on 1991 of Pta44 and the final
payout is likely to be decided by Repsol board in April.

PIRELLI, the troubled Italian cables and tyre manufacturer, has decided to
sell for Dollars 140m its 30.4 per cent stake in Condumex, the principal
channel for its Mexican operations, to Grupo Carso, the fast-growing Mexican
industrial group controlled by Mr Carlos Slim.
The sale is part of Pirelli's rationalisation plans to offset losses caused
mainly by its failed bid last year for Continental, the German tyre
manufacturer.
Although Pirelli is reducing fixed investment in Mexico, it has reached a
broad co-operation agreement with Grupo Carso which will assure the Italian
company privileged status as a 'preferred supplier'. Pirelli will become a
long-term supplier of technology and products in the cables sector through
Condumex.
Grupo Carso is now the largest shareholder in Telmex, the recently
privatised national telephone company which is committed to a significant
expansion programme over the coming years.
Ilva, the Italian state steel group, has sold a 5 per cent stake in Siderca,
Argentina's largest seamless steel tube manufacturer. The sale, mainly
placed privately by Morgan Stanley with US and European investors, raised
Dollars 75m.
Ilva retains some 6 per cent in Siderca, the third largest company
capitalised on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
BANK Austria, Austria's largest bank, is pushing through a big top
management reshuffle following heavy losses at the bank's London and New
York branches.
The bank, formed through the merger of Landerbank and Zentralsparkasse last
year, announced on Wednesday that two managing board members, Mr Manfred
Drennig and Mr Konrad Rumpold, would step down immediately, while Mr Herbert
Cordt, former board member, would leave his post as manager of an energy
subsidiary.
Mr Helmut Zilk, Vienna's mayor and chairman of the bank's supervisory board,
said the bank might demand financial restitution from the three men.
Bank Austria has already announced plans for a Sch5bn (Dollars 431m) charge
against 1991 profits, because of losses in the UK and the US.
The takeover of the British leasing company, Sovereign, in 1990 could alone
cost the bank Sch1bn. An internal report contends that Landerbank officials
should have known that Sovereign was effectively bankrupt at the time.
The three managers were responsible for Landerbank's foreign business in the
1980s. The move removes all Landerbank executives from the board and leaves
the management of Bank Austria in the hands of former Zentralsparkasse
personnel.
Other Austrian banks are also facing huge losses from foreign loans made
during the 1980s. Critics say the banks were poorly prepared for this
business and did not apply adequate supervision of their foreign branches.

<TEXT>
WESTDEUTSCHE Landesbank, the German regional public sector bank, yesterday
reported a 16 per cent rise in group operating profits to DM970m (Dollars
588m), helped by favourable interest rate margins and a low increase in
labour costs.
The Dusseldorf-based bank said its balance sheet total expanded by 11 per
cent to DM225bn. Excluding trading in foreign exchange and securities on its
own account, which contributed less to profits than in 1990 - DM143m against
DM166m - partial operating profits were 23 per cent higher at DM827m.
WestLB said its earnings on interest rate business were 15 per cent higher
last year at DM2.1bn, with commission income, affected by the slower
business in securities, 6 per cent higher at DM300m. Labour costs rose by 4
per cent to DM934m, with capital spending 17 per cent higher at DM827m,
including construction work and new computer installations.
Group net profits totalled DM195m, a rise of 56 per cent. The bank used part
of its income to increase its country risk provisions on foreign lending
(including the former Soviet Union).
These now stand at around 70 per cent of the total outstanding.
BIL GT, Liechtenstein's largest financial services group, reported net
income of SFr90.1m (Dollars 60.4m), more than double the SFr40.4m in the
previous year, writes Ian Rodger from Zurich.
The group, formerly known as Bank in Liechtenstein, was transformed into
primarily a fund management group following its acquisition of Britain's GT
Management in late 1989.
At the end of last year, it had SFr33.9bn under management, 19.8 per cent up
on the previous year-end, putting it in the same rank as Switzerland's
largest private banks.
The directors are recommending an increase in the 1991 dividend to SFr13 per
share or participation certificate from SFr12.

<TEXT>
SKF, the world's leading rolling bearing manufacturer, suffered a loss of
SKr221m (Dollars 37.4m) - after financial items - last year. This contrasts
with an impressive profit of SKr1.750bn for 1990.
At the after-tax level the group made a loss of SKr1.17bn in 1991, compared
with a SKr1.04bn net profit. SKF blamed the turnround on its Ovako steel
operations, which ran up a loss of SKr907m.
SKF predicted that while a significant upturn in the economic climate was
not probable for 1922, it expected an income improvement so that the company
would show a positive net financial result.
Group sales fell by 5.3 per cent last year to SKr26.3bn from SKr27.7bn with
a 10 per cent decline in volumes. The dividend is being held at SKr4.25 per
share.
The company announced that its chairman, the 70-year-old Mr Lennart
Johansson is retiring and that his post will be taken by Mr Anders Scharp,
also chairman of Electrolux and Saab-Scania.
SKF said it had cut its workforce by 11 per cent (about 6,000 people) as it
has adjusted its production and inventories since late 1990 to falling
demand for its products.
The reduction in personnel combined with a shortened working week resulted
in about SKr950m in non-recurring charges against income for the year. As
much as SKr250m of that sum related to costs of reducing the labour force by
an extra 2,000 this year.
Last December's division of Ovako between SKF and the Finnish Metra group
would enable SKF to concentrate on ball-bearing steel production and related
special steels and liquidate or sell off other activities outside Ovakos
core business.
It added that Ovako would be fully consolidated in SKF's results from this
year and this would result in an increase of around SKr3.7bn in SKF's
balance sheet.

<TEXT>
REPOLA, the Finnish forestry and engineering group, yesterday reported an
unexpectedly large pre-tax loss of FM1.86bn (Dollars 413m) for 1991 and
halved its dividend to FM0.65.
Repola, which had a profit of FM961m in 1990, predicted results in 1992
would remain poor, although better than in 1991, due to continued market
weakness. Sales declined by 5 per cent to FM22bn, while the operating profit
fell 63 per cent to FM577m.
Repola blamed its deficit mainly on foreign exchange losses of FM584m
stemming from the devaluation of the Finnish markka, as well as
restructuring costs associated with its pulp and shipbuilding operations.
All three of Repola's industrial groups posted losses. The United Paper
Mills unit had a pre-tax loss of FM775, reflecting a sales decrease for
pulp, sawn timber and joinery products.
Rauma, the metals and engineering unit, had a loss of FM609m, while
Rosenlaw, the plastic packaging division, reported a loss of FM73m.
Metsa-Serla, the Finnish forestry group, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss
of FM564m for 1991, against a deficit of FM41m in 1990.
It predicted a smaller loss in 1992 due to the devaluation of the Finnish
markka, cost-cutting measures and lower prices for wood raw materials.

<TEXT>
STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday reported a NKr1.6bn
(Dollars 25m) decline in 1991 pre-tax profit to NKr12.8bn, caused by lower
crude oil prices, losses in petrochemicals and a big fall in refining
profits.
The company said it could give no promise of an early recovery in main
markets.
Net profit for 1991 was boosted to NKr5.4bn from NKr4.3bn in 1990 due to a
non-recurring effect of reforms of Norwegian corporate tax. Without the tax
change, Statoil's net profit would have been NKr4.2bn.
Group operating revenue rose by NKr5.9bn to NKr78.3bn, but operating profit
was cut by NKr2.5bn to NKr13.5bn. Statoil anticipates a NKr1.4bn dividend
payment to the state, down from NKr1.5bn in 1990.
Crude oil production rose by 14m barrels to 138m, helped by strong growth in
output from the Gullfaks and Statfjord fields. Statoil noted the price for
Brent Blend marker crude averaged Dollars 20 a barrel in 1991 against
Dollars 24 a barrel in 1990.
Exploration and production experienced a NKr1.5bn fall in operating profit
to NKr9.3bn, and the natural gas division increased operating profit to
NKr3.6bn from NKr2.9bn, helped by higher gas prices and increased volumes of
transported gas.
Refining and marketing saw operating profit slide to NKr647m from NKr1.2bn,
mainly because of lower crude oil and products prices. Petrochemicals and
plastics, the group's worst performer, slid into an operating loss of NKr17m
from a profit of NKr718m.

NORWAY'S banking industry last year experienced credit losses of NKr19.8bn
(Dollars 3.09bn) in 1991, up from NKr12.3bn in 1990, according to a report
released yesterday by the Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission.
BISC, the country's finance watchdog, said the sharp rise in losses was
caused mainly by the experience of the commercial banks. It said the banks'
volume of non-performing loans rose significantly, particularly those loans
to households, while operating costs also increased sharply due to
write-offs on securities and property portfolios.
The commercial banks experienced combined credit losses of NKr15.4bn in
1991, up from NKr7.9bn in 1990.
The savings banks posted credit losses of NKr4.4bn in 1991, roughly the same
as in 1990.
BISC said the banks' results in 1991 worsened significantly and 15
commercial banks and nine savings banks - comprising the biggest in each
group - posted operating losses last year, against nine of each in 1990. The
commercial banks' operating losses totalled NKr14.56bn in 1991 against
losses of NKr4.72bn, while the savings banks' losses amounted to NKr1.88bn
against NKr1.16bn.

<TEXT>
KAUFHOF, the big German retail group whose activities range from department
stores to catering and travel agencies, achieved a one-third rise in profits
last year, helped by a sharp expansion of business in east Germany.
Mr Jens Odewald, the chief executive, said that Kaufhof's performance in
1991 would justify a 'substantial dividend increase'. No actual profit
figures are provided at this stage. In 1990, net profits rose by 12 per cent
to DM120m (Dollars 72.7m), with the dividend raised by DM2 to DM10.50 on the
ordinary shares and DM11.50 on preference stock.
Turnover last year was 22 per cent higher at DM18bn, with the department
stores showing growth of 18 per cent to DM6.8bn. Excluding the new east
German premises, sales of the store division were 3 per cent higher.
Kaufhalle, the group's stock market listed low-price store chain, achieved
turnover growth of 15 per cent to DM2.7bn; excluding new outlets, the rise
was 2 per cent.
Rapid growth was shown by the specialist outlets in the areas of home
electronics (Media Markt), computers (Vobis), mail order (Friedrich Wenz),
and shoes (Reno).
Because of the group's large-scale move into east Germany, its total labour
force increased by 25 per cent to 58,200 people.
Retail floor space was 15.5 per cent higher at 1.6m square metres. The group
has 831 outlets, including 180 in east Germany and 73 in other countries in
western Europe.
Contrasting with the improved performance of the rest of the group,
Oppermann Versand, a mail-order promotional gifts company, suffered a 9 per
cent fall in sales to DM318m.
This week, a Hamburg court ruled against Kaufhof in its claim for
compensation based on alleged misrepresentation of Oppermann's accounts when
it bought its majority stake from Mr Jurgen Oppermann late in 1989.
Mr Odewald said Kaufhof would appeal against this ruling. The amount claimed
in the Hamburg court was DM170m. Kaufhof began its legal action a year ago
after the acquisition had fallen into the red.

FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: British Gas expansion on target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS said yesterday that it was on target to expand its business
overseas so that its exploration and production division contributed 40 per
cent to its profits by the end of the decade.
'Just our developments in the North Sea alone will propel us to that
target,' said Mr Robert Evans, chairman. 'We are now producing oil and gas
in eight countries overseas and could see more than 40 per cent of our
profits coming from international exploration and production by 2000.'
Mr Howard Dalton, managing director of the exploration division, said he
would have a 29 per cent share of the capital expenditure budget this year
amounting to Pounds 754m. British Gas would spend this on its exploration
efforts in Tunisia, Russia and Argentina, among other countries.
In 1991, exploration and production contributed Pounds 221m to British Gas'
overall after-tax profit of Pounds 1.16bn. Mr Evans said that the group was
ready to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in the oil and gas
sector where share prices were severely depressed by low oil prices.
COMMENT
The City showed little reaction to British Gas's profits for last year and
the shares slipped 1p to 258p. That could be due to the difficulty of making
comparisons between last year and the previous one since the group has
changed its financial accounting year. But the shares are currently more
vulnerable to political or regulatory announcements about the future of
competition in the UK gas business than to small changes in British Gas's
profit levels. The company raised its dividend by 7 per cent to 10.25p for
the nine months from April - giving a notional level of 13.4p for the year
as a whole. British Gas is committed to raising its dividend and, for the
past few years, has increased the pay-out at a rate of 8 to 10 per cent a
year - well above the rate of inflation and the rest of the market. While
there is a great deal of regulatory risk to be taken on when investing in
the shares, the company is set for substantial growth in its international
exploration and production business which is outside the jurisdiction of UK
regulators. It is expected to triple its oil and gas production by 1995
compared with slight increases of about 1 per cent for the leading oil
companies. In addition, although the new domestic pricing formula will bite
into UK profits, Mr Evans is commited to a programme of cost reduction that
aims at minimising its effect. If the government and regulators go ahead
with an oft-threatened break-up of the company, that could also release
significant value for shareholders.

FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Courtaulds Textiles exceeds Pounds 42m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIGHT CONTROLS on working capital helped Courtaulds Textiles boost pre-tax
profits by 5 per cent to Pounds 42.2m in 1991 despite a drop in turnover to
Pounds 922m from Pounds 983.8m a year earlier reflecting the toughness of
trading conditions and disposals in the spinnning business.
The profit increase from Pounds 40.3m in 1990 came in spite of a sharp rise
in exceptional charges relating to closures of Pounds 4.7m, compared with
Pounds 1.3m.
'The slight improvement in UK market conditions last autumn has not come to
much,' said Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive. 'We are not assuming that the
trading environment will become more helpful to us during 1992.'
Net cash inflow before financing slipped to Pounds 38.7m (Pounds 45.7m),
although this was better than some analysts' expectations.
It contributed to net borrowings falling to Pounds 35.6m (Pounds 74.6m)
leaving gearing at the year end of 14.1 per cent (29.6 per cent). The fall
in borrowings helped the interest charge fall from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds
6.3m.
The increased tendency for UK retailers to order shorter runs of more
fashion-oriented items helped reduce working capital. Total capital employed
fell to Pounds 290.6m (Pounds 329.5m) leading to the return on capital
employed rising from 16.1 per cent to 18.3 per cent.
A final dividend of 8.8p lifts the total by 5.7 per cent to 13p.
A continued programme of plant closures in sock and lingerie manufacture,
cut staff by 20 per cent. At the same time, capital spending rose to Pounds
26.4m (Pounds 22.7m).
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 10.4m) covers leaving combed
cotton spinning, the sale of the French acrylic spinning unit and the
closure of two fabric making operations.
COMMENT
Courtaulds Textiles has won the confidence of the City with its effective
financial management. This has been reflected in the outperformance of the
shares. But can the company's resilient performance continue if the
consumers of the world fail to buy more clothes? It can to some extent.
There is still room for margin improvement on the manufacturing side: the
profitability of the money-spinning lace business has set new targets for
the rest of the company. If these are achieved, profits for 1992 could be as
high as Pounds 50m. Some areas of concern remain, however. The
sterling/dollar exchange rate is uncomfortably volatile and the introduction
of a minimum wage, were a Labour government to be elected, could put
pressure on costs. But with gearing having fallen from about 50 per cent to
less than 15 per cent in two years, the company is ready to buy a solid
business in Europe, perhaps spending more than Pounds 100m in the process.
There might be a rights issue, but institutions would be happier with one
call from Courtaulds Textiles than from just about anyone else in the
sector.

FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Christmas comes late at L Ashley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JIM Maxmin, the effusive American chief executive of the Laura Ashley
frocks and fabrics group, was in generous mood yesterday as he toured the
company's stores handing over big cheques to his staff.
Some employees in London received as much as Pounds 1,800 as a bonus for
their work over a three-month period from October to December.
This unaccustomed fit of generosity by a hard-pressed retailer in the middle
of a recession was part of the company's Profit Improvement Plan launched
last year with the purpose of 'incentivising' the staff at 10
underperforming stores.
Mr Maxmin had promised the staff at these stores they could share any
profits uplift they managed to generate.
Each store devised its own promotional strategy and these efforts resulted
in some impressive improvements. The highlights were in Liverpool where
profits were more than doubled and at London's Marble Arch branch where they
climbed by 62 per cent.
Mr Maxmin has engendered a fair degree of scepticism in the City because of
his somewhat eccentric approach.
But he defended himself yesterday: 'A lot of people thought that we were
mad. But we did it and made it work.'
. . . Now for Laura Ashley's other 500 outlets.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREENCORE, the Irish sugar and foods group, held a stormy annual meeting in
Dublin yesterday, the first since its privatisation last April.
A heated debate took place over the re-election of three directors who had
sat on the board of the company before privatisation and during 1988 and
1990,a period in which a series of controversial share deals resulted in a
subsidiary being bought out.
All were re-elected but some small shareholders have been upset by what many
regarded as a cavalier attitude by Mr Bernie Cahill, the chairman.
He caused an uproar yesterday on a motion on directors' fees, which was
clearly defeated by a show of hands; a lengthy ballot had to be then held
and the motion passed.
Costs of the share deal controversy are expected to exceed IPounds 5m, and
reduce pre-tax profits in 1991 by 17 per cent.
A High Court investigation into the affair is imminent.

FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Alfred McAlpine shows modest advance to
Pounds 9.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Alfred McAlpine yesterday jumped 12p to 205p after the
construction, housebuilding and building materials group announced a
marginal increase to Pounds 9.3m in pre-tax profits for the year to
end-October.
Profits in the previous 12 months amounted to Pounds 9.2m. The rise was in
line with forecast made by the group when it announced its Pounds 39m rights
issue last April.
Mr Graeme Odgers, chief executive, said that profits could rise further in
the current year provided that the recent improvement in the group's housing
division was sustained.
He said that the profits improvement stemmed from lower costs, reduced
interest charges as a result of lower borrowings and a reduction in
provisions made against housing land and developments.
Even so, McAlpine was only able to pay a maintained final dividend of 5.8p -
making a a same again total of 10.3p - by raiding reserves.
After all deductions the group incurred a total loss of Pounds 2.3m. This
was struck after an extraordinary provision of Pounds 3.9m, mainly to cover
further losses and write-downs in the concrete block business which is
currently up for sale.
Mr Odgers said that this was a substantial improvement on the previous year
when the group made extraordinary provisions of Pounds 39.5m for a total
loss of Pounds 35.7m.
'We believe that there should be no further provisions. We have reorganised
substantially the business and management of the company and have improved
the balance sheet. Gearing has been been reduced from 60 per cent 18 months
ago to about 5 per cent including off-balance sheet finance.
'Given that the dividend, before extraordinary items, was covered 1.4 times,
on earnings of 14.1p, we felt that we should maintain payments to our
shareholders, particularly after a rights issue,' said Mr Odgers.
A breakdown of profits after interest showed that construction made Pounds
13m against Pounds 13.3m; housebuilding incurred a Pounds 1.2m loss (Pounds
1.9m loss); building materials made a Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 3.2m) profit while
US profits fell from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 2.3m.
COMMENT
The sharp rise in McAlpine's share price recognises the big improvement in
management since Graeme Odgers arrival. He has done all the right things in
reducing borrowings, reorganising and cutting fat from central management
overheads and weeding out poor performing businesses. In the current year
margins on housebuilding will continue to benefit from cheaper land prices
while the switch of Pounds 35m of debt from sterling to dollars will assist
finance costs. On the other hand construction profits are expected to fall
sharply while building materials and US operations will at best remain flat.
If the group makes Pounds 10m this year - which some analysts believe is
optimistic - the shares will be on a multiple of 17 which looks a little
high given that there are better pure housebuilding recovery stocks around.

Increased turnover and profits in its overseas subsidiaries enabled group
turnover and pre-tax profits at Macro 4, the independent software company,
to rise by 9 per cent and 14 per cent respectively in the six months to
December 31. This was in line with the board's expectations, said Mr Terry
Kelly, chairman.
Taxable profits advanced to Pounds 3.83m (Pounds 3.37m) and were struck on
turnover of Pounds 8.83m (Pounds 8.1m). Earnings rose to 11.5p (10.1p
restated) and the interim dividend is lifted to 5.14p (3.825p).
Mr Kelly said that the UK had continued to be 'a cautious and nervous
marketplace against a depressed economic background'. Longer purchase
decision cycles were also noticeable in Scandinavia and Australia.

FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Midland bad debt level confounds City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CORRIDORS of Midland Group's majestic City of London headquarters echoed
to the sound of its bankers touching wood yesterday, as one after another
mused about the likelihood of their bank being on the road to recovery.
The group's 1991 pre-tax profit of Pounds 36m, up from Pounds 11m in the
previous year, was far better than City analysts had been anticipating. The
widespread expectation was that Midland would make a thumping loss and
withhold a dividend payment for the second half of the year.
But Midland paid out a second interim of 1.7p, making 3.4p for the full year
 -though this is sharply down on 1990's 9p.
Indeed the extent of any recovery should not be exaggerated. The dividend
was drawn from reserves in both years, since there were losses per share of
6.2p in 1991, sharply reduced from 24.7p previously.
The principal reason for the turnround was the fall in the second half of
the year in the charge for bad and doubtful debts to Pounds 373m, compared
with Pounds 530m in the first half. The fall was a particular surprise to
analysts, since Midland was thought to have made a loss of about Pounds 60m
on its loans to the Maxwell empire. This decline also bucked the trend at
the other clearing banks.
Bad debt charges consist in part of loans that have been written off,
because the bank has severed a relationship with a customer and there is no
prospect of recovery. However, another element of the charge is a provision
against possible losses on loans where there may be a prospect of some
repayment.
In the latter case, banks and their auditors have to use their judgment
about the magnitude of likely losses. Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief
executive, insisted that the bank was not being too optimistic in reducing
the bad debt charge.
His explanation for the fall was that Midland had made heavy charges in the
second half of 1990 and the first half of 1991 - in other words, he believes
that Midland predicted the likely trend to bad debts earlier and better than
the other banks.
It is difficult to make a meaningful comparison between the bad debt charges
made by different banks, because the statistics they disclose are not
compiled on the same basis. However IBCA, the rating agency, believes that
Midland's charge for bad UK loans in the whole of 1991 may indeed have been
higher, as a percentage of its UK loans, than the other banks, as the
accompanying table shows.
Midland's declining bad debt charge meant that it made a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 107m in the second half of the year, compared with a Pounds 71m loss
in the first half. However, Midland's trading profits before bad debts were
Pounds 468m in the latter half of 1991, down from Pounds 480m in the first
half.
Sir Peter Walters, the bank's chairman, pointed out encouraging trends in
the full-year performance.
Operating expenses, at Pounds 2.38bn, were held at almost exactly the same
level as in 1990, largely because staff numbers were reduced by 4,900, or 9
per cent, over the past 18 months.
Midland also enjoyed 7 per cent growth in net interest income, which was
almost twice as fast as any of its main rivals. Part of the reason was that
over the past two years the bank has adjusted the structure of its borrowing
and lending rates for UK personal customers and small businesses, having for
several years tolerated an interest rate structure less profitable than
those of its rivals.
Growth in service charges, fees and other banking income was up 9.8 per cent
 -significantly slower than at Barclays and NatWest, though twice the rate
of Lloyds' growth.
Bad debts meant that the core UK bank made a loss of Pounds 147m before tax,
up from last year's Pounds 46m. But there was a strong contribution of
Pounds 109m, up from Pounds 79m, from the corporate and investment banking
businesses grouped together in Midland Montagu.
Midland's newest business, First Direct - a branchless bank providing its
services by telephone - now has 200,000 customers. Sir Peter said if the
costs of winning new accounts were excluded, First Direct was now profitable
 -thereby confounding the analysts again.

FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Thomas Cook declines 68% to Pounds 8.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS of Thomas Cook, the travel subsidiary of Midland Bank, fell 68 per
cent to Pounds 8.9m pre-tax for the 1991 year. Turnover rose 6 per cent to
Pounds 429.6m, writes Michael Skapinker.
The results were a sharp contrast to those of other large tour operators -
such as Airtours and Owners Abroad - which recently reported large profit
increases. The operators gained increased market share following the
collapse last year of Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group. Thomas
Cook, however, provided Pounds 2m in exceptional costs resulting from
refunds and alternative holidays offered to ILG customers. The company was
also badly affected by the Gulf war and the downturn in business travel.
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, said many companies had instructed
travelling employees to book cheaper classes of airline tickets. Thomas Cook
also suffered from corporate customers' financial difficulties. A further
Pounds 8m exceptional provision was made against bad debts and travellers'
cheque fraud.
Mr Middleton said the company had continued to expand in continental Europe.
It had invested in new businesses in the Netherlands and Belgium, expanded
operations in Germany and opened its first office in Prague. He added that
the company was interested in buying the 50 per cent stake in Thomas Cook
Travel in the US that was owned by companies associated with the late Mr
Robert Maxwell.

FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Tarmac plans to redeem some Amps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TARMAC, Britain's biggest construction and building materials concern, was
yesterday the latest company to announce plans to redeem some of its auction
market preferred stock (Amps).
The announcement follows the decision by ECC Group, the china clay company,
to redeem Dollars 350m (Pounds 200m) of Amps financed by a rights issue.
Tarmac's credit rating is currently under review by the US agencies and
analysts expect it to fall. Mr Terence Mason, finance director, said that
since the review was announced, dividends set on its Amps through the
regular auctions has risen to as high as 120 per cent of US commercial paper
rates.
With its current single A rating Tarmac's Amps have a maximum dividend of
125 per cent of commercial paper rates, but if its rating fell to BBB the
maximum would be 175 per cent.
Tarmac plans to repay Dollars 150m of the Dollars 300m it issued in October
1990 when it bought out the minority of Lone Star Industries, its US
subsidiary. The group has sufficient unused dollar borrowing facilities to
cover the redemption and will pay lower interest rates on it.
The other Dollars 150m is connected to a long-term swap transaction and will
not be redeemed. Tarmac's shares rose 1p to 119p yesterday.

FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: DTI criticises BOM chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSPECTORS appointed by the Department of Trade and Industry have expressed
'strong disapproval' of some aspects of the conduct of Mr Michael Lucas,
chairman of BOM Holdings, a retailer and property developer that has gone
into liquidation.
Overall, however, they found that Mr Lucas 'worked very hard on behalf of
BOM's shareholders in an honest endeavour to turn BOM once more into a
profitable company.'
The Stock Exchange was criticised for its initial approval of a defective
rights issue circular in December 1988. But the inspectors concluded that
the blame rested principally with TC Coombs, which 'failed in its
responsibility as a sponsoring broker'. The Stock Exchange was 'wholly
justified' in stopping the rights issue three weeks later.
The DTI launched an investigation into BOM in February 1990 after numerous
complaints from shareholders perturbed by the company's failure to produce
accounts for the year to January 1989 and its agreement to sell land at a
price thought to be less than its true market value.
Some shareholders had alleged that Mr Lucas had an undisclosed interest in
the land sale.
The DTI's report dismissed the allegations of fraud and said that the price
agreed for the land was fair. But it criticised a corporate video made by
the company in October 1988 which estimated the value of the land with
planning permission at between Pounds 75m and Pounds 100m.
Mr Lucas was also criticised for not disclosing transactions in BOM shares
in which he was interested.
The controversial sale was not completed and the land was sold at auction by
a mortgagee for Pounds 1.8m in May 1990.
The inspectors said that unless claims against third parties were
successful, shareholders have no prospect of receiving any money for their
shares.

FOREIGN &amp; Colonial Investment Trust has increased its final dividend by 11.6

The investment trust, the UK's largest, said that the increase reflected its
strong revenue position, rather than any confidence in the prospects for
future dividend growth.
'It may well be that in the 1990s, it will prove impossible to increase
dividends and net assets at the same rate as in the 1980s' said Mr John
Sclater, chairman.
In 1991, the trust's net assets per share grew by 21.6 per cent,
outperforming the FT-A All-Share Index.
F&amp;C benefited from its decision to borrow money and invest in the weak
equity markets of 1990.
Net assets per share at end-1991 were 184.5p, compared with 151.7p at
end-1990. Earnings per share were 3.38p (3.29p) and total net assets were
Pounds 969.4m (Pounds 797m).
The final dividend was 2.12p (1.9p), making a total of 3.19p (2.9p), the
21st consecutive annual increase.
At the end of 1991, the trust's portfolio was split in assets terms between;
the UK (41 per cent); US (27 per cent); Japan (9 per cent); Far East (3 per
cent) and Europe (18 per cent).
F&amp;C uses the foreign exchange markets to mismatch its asset and currency
exposure. In currency terms, it had a relatively greater exposure to Japan
and Europe than it had in asset terms.
The trust was the first to introduce a savings scheme and it said it had
passed the 50,000 shareholder mark early this year. Private investors now
own 35 per cent of the company.
Mr Michael Hart, joint manager of the trust, said that he was 'fairly
hopeful about the UK market. It is lowly rated, although the big uncertainty
is the election. If the Conservatives win, everyone will be cheered up and
interest rates will come down.'
Mr Hart was optimistic about Europe which will benefit from an eventual fall
in German interest rates and regarding Japan, he said the position 'looks
pretty terrible on the surface, but we are doing some cautious buying.'

<TEXT>
CABRA ESTATES, the property company which may evict Chelsea Football Club
from its west London ground if it does not pay Pounds 22.85m for the site,
yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 11.3m for the six months to
September 30, compared with Pounds 5.23m.
On turnover reduced to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 25.5m), Cabra made a small
profit, before interest payable of Pounds 3.48m and exceptional charges of
Pounds 8.41m for property write downs.
In addition, a Pounds 10m cut in the value of Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea
play, went straight to the balance sheet.
Cabra said this left a net asset value per share of 17.13p making total
assets of Pounds 16.5m. Net debt, which is on demand, remained at about
Pounds 52m, according to Mr John Duggan, chairman. He said Cabra had the
support of its bankers.
Losses per share, after a Pounds 474,000 tax credit, were 11.34p (5.81p) and
the interim dividend is passed (0.1p).

FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Royal Insurance loss at Pounds 373m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXTENT of the damage inflicted on Royal Insurance by the recession
became clear yesterday when the company reported pre-tax losses of Pounds
373m.
Recession-related underwriting losses of Pounds 545m (Pounds 313m) in the UK
were the most serious black spot, overshadowing reduction in costs and
improvements in underwriting in the group's international operations.
The continuing weakness in the housing market and high levels of mortgage
default in the UK are generating Royal's most serious problems.
Losses from domestic mortgage indemnity policies - which cover lenders
against any losses they might suffer following the sale of a repossessed
property - amounted to Pounds 257m in 1991 (Pounds 10m).
Royal, which has about 20 per cent of the UK market, paid Pounds 66m (Pounds
23m) in actual claims, with the bulk of the losses mainly the result of a
steep increase in provisions against future claims.
This follows a change in accounting procedures last year when the the
company opted to provide for claims as soon as repossessions occur rather
than after the sale of a repossessed property.
The change means that effectively 21 months of claims are included in the
figures for the year. Royal said last year that it had revised its estimates
of future claims a further Pounds 150 to Pounds 200m in 1992 and 1993.
The company has also been hit by a rise in recession-related claims. Despite
an increase in rates on commercial lines business - ranging from between 10
per cent rises on packaged commercial policies to 23 per cent increases for
motor fleet business - underwriting losses in the UK climbed during the
year.
Losses on commercial property insurances rose to Pounds 54m (Pounds 32m),
commercial packages Pounds 17m (Pounds 13m), motor fleets Pounds 39m (Pounds
37m) and marine and aviation Pounds 59m (Pounds 30m).
Bright spots in the UK included - - a fall in the cost of subsidence claims
to Pounds 64m (Pounds 126m)
Outside the UK the overall picture is much brighter. The US subsidiary made
a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3m (Pounds 89m loss), Royal International Pounds
2m (Pounds 13m loss), and Royal Canada increased its profit to Pounds 35m
(Pounds 30m).

FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Emap favourite to buy MBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMAP, the newspaper, magazine and exhibitions group, last night emerged as
favourite to buy Maxwell Business Communications from Price Waterhouse, the
administrator.
The fast-growing group is believed to have entered into detailed
negotiations with PW in advance of an expected announcement.
The 70-strong MBC group, part of Maxwell Communication Corporation,
attracted considerable interest. A number of the bidders were only
interested in part of the group which also includes an interest in
exhibitions.
Emap has made a bid for all of MBC in partnership with Mr Brian Gilbert, a
former chairman of MBC. It is expected that after the deal is complete the
partners will divide up the parts in which they are most interested. Emap
would almost certainly be interested in the exhibitions and in titles such
as Architect's Journal and Media Week.
The bidders included a management buy-out team and Associated Newspapers,
publisher of the Daily Mail.

FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Drayton Cons seeks advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRAYTON Consolidated, an investment trust specialising in unquoted
companies, yesterday said it had sought professional advice on the future of
the trust.
The announcement follows reports that institutional shareholders are seeking
to remove Invesco MIM as managers.
The advisers, County Natwest and Cazenove are to conduct a valuation of the
trust's assets with the assistance of auditors and make recommendations
which could include plans to wind up the trust completely.
However, because the value of many of the smaller unquoted companies has
suffered in the current recession, a full wind-up is not considered likely.
Drayton Consolidated said other options included liquidating part of the
company and passing cash to shareholders. Currently the shares are trading
at a 55 per cent discount to net asset value of about 350p.
The shares, of which 90 per cent are in the hands of institutions, fell
further recently following the trust's announcement that it had written off
nearly Pounds 20m it had invested in Alma Holdings. Alma represented
Drayton's second largest unquoted investment.

FT  28 FEB 92 / British Gas agrees terms with OFT: Company to trim share of
industrial market and form pipeline subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS will announce details of an agreement with the Office of Fair
Trading in the next few days that will lead to the company halving its share
of the industrial gas market by 1995 and splitting off its pipeline and
storage division into a separate subsidiary, the company said yesterday.
The industry retains grave doubts about how British Gas will arrange the
sale of significant amounts of its gas to competitors, as is envisaged by
the OFT.
The first gas sales are due to begin in October. Some observers say that
without adequate regulation the auction may push prices higher in the UK.
The Office of Gas Supply, the industry regulator, has resisted any deal that
would lead to higher prices for domestic and industrial consumers.
British Gas yesterday reported an after-tax profit of Pounds 1.16bn for last
year. That compares with a profit of Pounds 1.21bn in the year from April
1990 to March 1991. Since the company has changed its financial year,
comparisons with previous figures are hard to make.
Mr Robert Evans, British Gas chairman, said yesterday the company gained
280,000 customers in 1991 and installed about 500,000 central heating
systems in spite of the recession.
However, Mr Evans said that the recession had affected some customers'
ability to pay and that outstanding debt from non-paying customers had risen
to Pounds 40m from about Pounds 30m the year before.
During the year, 150,000 additional customers had been forced by financial
difficulties to secure special payment arrangements. The company said that
slightly fewer than 1m households now pay by special arrangement.
The disconnection rate had dropped, Mr Evans said, to 18,000; the lowest
yearly rate recorded by the company.
In April, British Gas will have to work within the confines of a tough new
pricing formula for domestic customers imposed by its regulator. Mr Evans
said there would be no change in prices in April, 'but given another year
with low inflation and prices will be down in real terms'.
Sir James McKinnon, director general of Ofgas, said the fact that British
Gas saw profit from sales of gas to domestic customers rise by about Pounds
100m in 1991 demonstrated that it had been 'high time for a tariff review'.
The rise in domestic profits was offset by a small fall in earnings from the
industrial market, where the company lost about 25 per cent of its market
share to competitors by the end of 1991, bringing its market share down to
about 70 per cent.
Mr Evans said the company's capital expenditure for this year would be
Pounds 2.5bn - a record - most of which will be invested in the UK.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Philips in black but omits dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   EINDHOVEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, swung back into profit in 1991, the
first full year of its far-reaching restructuring efforts, but the company
omitted the dividend for the second year running.
Net profit totalled Fl 981m (Pounds 302m) in 1991 compared with a net loss
of Fl 4.53bn in 1990, when heavy restructuring provisions produced the
biggest corporate loss in Dutch history.
Operating profit, excluding restructuring costs in both years, rose by 35
per cent to Fl 3bn. Mr Jan Timmer, president, said that the increase in
operating profits had been satisfactory but also noted that the company had
faced disappointments and setbacks in its consumer electronics division.
He declined to comment on when Philips would resume dividend payments. He
also warned that increases in turnover and net profit from normal business
operations would be limited in 1992 because an economic revival in many
industrialised countries was not expected before the end of the year.
In particular, there was little prospect of a recovery in the first quarter
of this year in the consumer electronics division, the only core sector
which did not see a profit increase in 1991.
Operating profits in the consumer division, which was severely hit by
continuing recession in leading markets, fell to Fl 1.01bn from Fl 1.50bn in
1990.
However, Mr Timmer sounded a positive note on the impact of the
restructuring programme.
During 1991, Philips divested companies with combined turnover of Fl 2.2bn
and cut 32,800 jobs, in line with forecasts.
'We are not dissatisfied with what we have achieved,' he said, but added
that the company was 'still far removed from where we want to be'.
Redundancies would continue to be necessary, but not to the same degree as
in 1991.
Philips intended to continue disposing of non-core businesses and those
which did not meet performance targets. However, Mr Timmer said he did not
plan to sell entire divisions - such as semi-conductors, communications or
medical technology - or to reduce the group's stake in PolyGram, its 80 per
cent-owned music company.
The sale of Philips' mini-computer activities to Digital of the US helped
account for the sharp rise in operating income in professional products and
systems.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Shake-up helps ICI hold fall to 11%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI, the UK chemicals giant, yesterday confirmed the world economy's gloomy
state when it warned that the commodity chemical cycle might not pick up
until next year and a recovery was likely to be gradual.
The company reported pre-tax profits down 11 per cent from Pounds 936m to
Pounds 843m for the year to December 31. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said
fourth-quarter results were disappointing and full-year figures could not be
viewed as satisfactory. 'In the UK, the signs of an upturn are so faint as
to be virtually invisible,' he said. 'Politicians' crystal balls appear
rather clearer than ours, which are based on demand from customers.'
Sir Denys said there was, as yet, little sign of economic growth resuming in
the leading industrialised countries. The company had not been immune to the
depressed state of key markets, but the impact had been reduced by vigorous
self-help measures, he added.
The company had reduced its head-count by more than 12,000 during 1991, and
more than 20 plants and operating sites had been closed. The ongoing
rationalisation programme had added Pounds 140m to the profit figures, said
Sir Denys. The company had also sold more than 20 businesses, raising more
than Pounds 500m. He expected further disposals this year, although not at
the same rate as 1991.
Group turnover fell from Pounds 12.91bn in 1990 to Pounds 12.49bn last year.
A 4 per cent fall in sales and adverse currency movements had been offset by
increased selling prices and acquisitions.
Trading profits for the last quarter increased 62 per cent from Pounds 121m
to Pounds 193m. One analyst described results at the industrial chemicals
operations as 'shocking', as they fell from a Pounds 61m profit during the
last quarter of 1990 to a Pounds 2m loss for the same period last year.
Sir Denys again attacked electricity pricing in the UK. He said that in
spite of continuous efforts for more than a year, he had been unable to
achieve a satisfactory solution over electricity prices and supply.
The figures for 1990 were restated to meet new accounting procedures.
Earnings per share fell 7.2 per cent from 82.3p to 76.4p. The board declared
a second interim dividend of 34p a share, the same as last year, making a
total 55p for 1991. ICI's shares fell 23p to Pounds 12.84.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Sweden names SSAB as first candidate for sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SSAB, the steel group, is to be the first Swedish state company to be sold
entirely into the private sector under the conservative government's
privatisation programme.
The government is expected to announce the sales of its controlling stake in
SSAB next month. Its programme of planned privatisations covers 35
state-owned or partially-owned companies.
The sale of the government's stake in SSAB - 47.8 per cent of the equity and
60.4 per cent share of voting rights - is expected in the early summer.
SSAB's other main shareholders are Skandia, Wasa and SPP, all Swedish
insurance companies.
Many observers believe SSAB is a highly suitable candidate for early
privatisation. The company went through radical restructuring before its
introduction to the Stockholm bourse in 1989. In that year, it recorded
profits of SKr1.5bn (Pounds 142m) followed by a SKr954m profit in 1990.
The recession hit demand for steel across Europe, with a 15 per cent decline
in Sweden. In spite of this and price-cutting, SSAB is one of the few
European steel makers which made a profit - about SKr200m in 1991.
Steel industry analysts do not rule out a foreign steel company buying the
state's share in SSAB.
One candidate may be British Steel which has been seeking to expand
continental European operations to reduce its reliance on the UK market.
Last November, British Steel signed an agreement with SSAB to form a joint
company to produce electrical steels with the UK company taking 75 per cent.
The other main European candidates would be Usinor Sacilor, the French
state-owned group, and Thyssen, the giant German steel and engineering
combine.
Usinor, however, is consolidating its position after a string of
acquisitions, while Thyssen says its priority is to diversify from steel and
engineering. Another candidate might be Rautaruukki, the Finnish steel
producer.
SSAB's value to other European steel producers might be limited. It is
concentrated on some high value specialist steel markets, and offers limited
opportunities to reap economies of scale through a merger.
Mr Per Westerberg, industry minister, said other Swedish companies to be
privatised soon were LKAB, the mining group, OK Petroleum and the Celsius
industrial group which has a strong defence product portfolio.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Midland ahead in second half: Shares rise as payout
announced. Bad debt charges at Pounds 903m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND Group yesterday bucked the trend of recent bank results by
disclosing a sharp improvement in profits in the second half of 1991.
It confounded City of London analysts' forecasts by paying a dividend,
though it is maintaining the payment at the 1.7p level paid in the latter
half of 1990, when it made a heavy cut. As a result, Midland's share price
rose 21p to 260p, adding Pounds 165m to the value of the bank.
Midland was the last of the big banks to report its results. Although it has
made progress, the scale of its charges to cover the risk of bad debts - at
Pounds 903m - provided final confirmation that 1991 was the worst year since
the 1930s for UK banks.
Collectively the four banks - Midland, National Westminster, Barclays and
Lloyds - have suffered loan losses of Pounds 5.6bn.
Midland's bad debt charge was far lower than analysts had been expecting.
But on one important measure, it suffered worse loan loss problems than
rivals. Its bad debt charge was the biggest of the clearers if measured as a
proportion of its UK loans - though it was the smallest in absolute terms.
Separately, Mr Brian Pearse, the chief executive, responded to City
speculation that it was about to merge with another bank by saying he had no
desire to do such a deal. 'It is not clear what advantages it would bring',
he said.
But he said he had no doubt that rivals would be considering whether to make
a takeover offer for Midland, because Midland's share price was so much
lower than the value of its net assets. He added that he was sure Midland
would be changed beyond recognition in the coming few years, perhaps by
combining with another bank, because he is convinced there are 'too many'
financial institutions in the UK and worldwide.
However, Midland's pre-tax profits grew in 1991 from Pounds 11m to Pounds
36m. The recovery was particularly striking between the two halves of the
year. It made Pounds 107m before tax in the second six months - more than
National Westminster Bank, which is twice its size - having made a Pounds
71m loss in the first half.
The main contributor to the second-half recovery was a decline in the bad
debt charge to Pounds 373m from Pounds 530m.
An analysis of the full-year result highlights other trends described as
encouraging by Midland's chairman, Sir Peter Walters.
Overheads were unchanged, due in large part to a reduction of 4,900 in staff
numbers during the past 18 months. There was also a 7 per cent rise in
interest income, twice as fast as that achieved by any of its rivals.
Sir Peter said he was optimistic that Midland would continue to buck
economic conditions by increasing its income. He added that he expected the
bad debt rate in 1992 to run at the reduced rate experienced in the latter
half of 1991.
One respect in which Midland remains weaker than its English peers is in the
strength of its balance sheet, as measured by its tier 1 or core capital,
which is the internationally accepted measure. Midland's tier 1 capital is
equivalent to 5.5 per cent of its assets, the same ratio as NatWest's and
far higher than many foreign banks.
However, Barclays has a 5.9 per cent ratio and Lloyds has 6.2 per cent. But
Mr Pearse said that he had no desire to raise money through a rights issue.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Russia plans to end price controls on key items
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government yesterday announced politically explosive plans to
remove the remaining price controls on key items ranging from oil to vodka
in the next two months.
The announcement is a bold gamble by the government to push through radical
economic reforms in the face of gathering political opposition, and to
secure early financial assistance from the west.
A draft programme worked out with the International Monetary Fund and
approved by the government yesterday would keep price controls on medicines,
baby food and local services such as rents.
Oil and gas prices will be liberalised when the heating season ends on April
20, but the price of basic consumer items such as vodka, bread, milk,
matches and sugar will be freed by the end of March.
The timing is politically risky given that the price rises will be
introduced just a week before the convening of the Congress of People's
Deputies, Russia's top legislature, whose increasingly discontented members
have the power to sack the government.
To offset such discontent, the government hopes to secure significant
western support by the end of March, when the executive board of the IMF is
expected to give its final seal of approval to the programme that is now
being forwarded to it in Washington.
Although IMF resources will only be available later this year, a positive
response should give Russia access to other western finance - including a
stabilisation fund for the rouble - which have been made conditional on IMF
support.
A debt relief package granted by the Group of Seven leading industrialised
countries to the republics also comes up for renewal at the end of March.
Its extension until the end of this year is conditional upon the
implementation of IMF-approved reforms.
Most Russian retail prices were liberalised on January 2, with devastating
effects for consumers. But the prices of some essential items remained
regulated - albeit at a much higher fixed price - for fear of a consumer
backlash.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister responsible for economic reform,
told yesterday's cabinet meeting that the further liberalisation would help
create a 'normally functioning market mechanism by the end of the year'.

FT  28 FEB 92 / Europe's workers like their jobs but not their pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH workers like their bosses but complain about their pay. Swiss
workers are virtual workaholics while the Spanish are the least enthusiastic
workforce in Europe.
All in all workers in northern Europe enjoy their jobs more than those in
the south, although things have improved in Italy in the past year according
to a survey of workers in eight European countries.
Across Europe, workers think their pay is too low, and no one tells them
what is going on. They think their management is poor but company loyalty
and job satisfaction are high.
The Swiss score top for enthusiasm in 10 of the 12 categories. Workers in
Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium are also more positive about most
aspects of work than those in Italy and Spain.
More than 80 per cent of Swiss believe their jobs are worthwhile, though
they are less satisfied with their pay than the Dutch (53 per cent against
59) and less secure about their jobs than the Italians (68 against 70).
Satisfaction is also high in Germany, although workers there have become
significantly less enthusiastic over the past 12 months, complaining about
lack of consultation, training and benefits.
More than half of Dutch workers believe they are well paid and their only
gripes are about training and job security.
The Confederation of Dutch Industry, which speaks for 80 per cent of
employers, said the explanation might be more mercenary than cultural. 'It
is so easy for Dutch workers to stay at home because of our generous sick
pay and disability benefits.' It said a sixth of the Dutch workforce was
currently in receipt of benefit.
Spanish workers are the least enthusiastic. Two-thirds believe they are
poorly paid. They complain about their management, training and conditions,
but not about their immediate bosses.
The Italians are nearly as dissatisfied as the Spanish overall, and feel
only slightly better organised. They believe their working practices are the
least efficient in Europe, though attitudes have improved over the last 12
months.
British workers like their immediate bosses, colleagues and conditions but
complain about pay, job satisfaction and training, and their company loyalty
rating (67 per cent) is the lowest of the eight countries.
Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: 'I do
agree that our training leaves a lot to be desired. That means workers will
be lower skilled, less well organised and less motivated.'

collapse of the merger talks between British Airways and KLM

It was late on Wednesday night. Executives from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and
British Airways had been meeting separately for hours on either side of the
English Channel in a last-ditch attempt to save the planned merger between
the two airlines.
The negotiators had spent months on an elusive project called 'Sahara'. It
was an attempt to create a formidable airline group with an extensive
international route network into north America and the Far East, served by
one of the world's most modern fleets and fed by two of Europe's biggest
airports, the expanding Schiphol near Amsterdam and London's Heathrow.
The planned merger would have created a European company capable of matching
the scale of US airlines such as Delta, American Airlines and United, which
are increasingly aggressive rivals on transatlantic routes.
For BA there was an added attraction. KLM's minority stake in Northwest
Airlines offered possible access to the US market which it had been denied
by the failure of merger talks with United in 1990.
So why on Wednesday night did the two teams of weary negotiators conclude
that they could go no further? And where does it leave the two airlines?
The talks got off to a good start last September. The two airlines had
already worked closely in an attempt to create a European airline built
around Sabena, the Belgian carrier.
Advisers to both companies said the atmosphere had been good. The main
protagonists, Mr Piet Bouw, KLM's president, and Sir Colin Marshall, BA's
chief executive, struck up a good relationship. A KLM executive said
yesterday: 'Both sides wanted to come to an agreement but it just was not to
be.'
The co-operative atmosphere helped the two companies to devise ways of
overcoming some of the practical obstacles they faced. In January, Mr Bouw
disclosed that KLM was prepared to give up its name for the sake of the
merger. The negotiators believed they had found a solution to one of the
trickiest problems they faced: how the merged airline could retain the
landing rights which airline regulators around the world had granted to the
national airlines separately.
Financial advisers involved in the talks said there had also been common
ground on the main operational issues of how the merged airline should be
run, including the way its marketing and sales forces should be managed,
ticketing systems, aircraft maintenance and joint procurement. These matters
were not mere details. By pulling together the two airlines' operations the
merger held out the prospect of generating huge combined savings - of about
Pounds 100m a year in the first year, rising to perhaps Pounds 500m after
several years.
BA and KLM were buoyed by the track record of earlier Anglo-Dutch mergers,
notably Shell in oil and Unilever in consumer goods. The key to the success
of both these deals was their shareholding structure. Although both Shell
and Unilever are merged groups, they retain separate British and Dutch
national companies. At Shell, the national parent companies are paid
dividends from a joint holding company which manages the company's assets.
Unilever operates a complex profit equalisation agreement which determines
how profits should be shared.
BA and KLM set out to create a profit-sharing structure modelled on
Unilever. The two national companies were to be paid shares of the profits
earned by the merged group. It was in these discussions that the negotiators
hit the insurmountable obstacle which brought the talks to an end.
Various measures were discussed to determine how the profits of the combined
group should be shared. BA's market capitalisation is about Pounds 1.6bn,
three times that of KLM, suggesting a 75 per cent/25 per cent split in
favour of BA. If a profits share-out were based on the capital reserves in
the companies' balance sheets, it would split in BA's favour by 65 per cent
to 35 per cent. Estimates of the two companies' cashflow, their net earnings
combined with the amount they spend upon depreciation, would also suggest a
65/35 split.
However, from the outset KLM made it clear it wanted at least 40 per cent of
the profits from the merged group. It wanted the valuation to take account
of the long-term value of its stake in Northwest in the US even though the
airline's recent losses have helped to depress KLM's share price.
The Dutch airline also wanted the deal to take account of two of its assets
not included in its market capitalisation - its strong position at Schiphol,
and its recent investment in fleet modernisation. In 1989 KLM ordered 36
aircraft worth Fl 5bn (Pounds 1.5bn) which were for delivery up to the
mid-1990s. It calculates that because it has spent so much creating the most
up-to-date fleet in the world after Singapore Airlines, the merged airline
would have to spend less on fleet modernisation.
This valuation was rebutted from BA. An adviser commented: 'BA was vitally
interested in its share price, earnings dilution and its dividend policy.
KLM was not as interested in those issues. The two companies' operating
cultures are very compatible but they live in completely different financial
cultures.'
BA stuck out for a deal to give it at least 70 per cent of the merged group.
The reasons for its insistence are clear from calculations by Mr Mark
Simpson, an airline analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the stockbroker. He
forecasts BA will make net profits of Pounds 289m in 1993 and KLM will earn
about Pounds 100m. Assuming the merger would have generated after-tax
savings of Pounds 80m in its first year, the merged group would have had net
profits of Pounds 469m.
If these profits had been shared out on a 70/30 split in BA's favour, its
earnings would have been enhanced by about 14 per cent, while KLM's would
have risen 41 per cent. If the split had been 65/35, BA would have still got
a marginal profits enhancement of about 6 per cent, with KLM enjoying a 64
per cent leap in profits.
A 65/35 deal might just have been presentable in the City. But a 60/40 split
would have left BA suffering an unacceptable dilution of its earnings.
Despite warnings that a 60/40 deal would not get off the ground with
investors in London and New York, the Dutch persisted. A BA adviser said:
'The Dutch were terribly stubborn. At the start everyone assumed they were
not serious when they said they wanted 40 per cent. But they just would not
budge.'
Dutch politicians' fear of job losses and the loss of identity for the
national flag carrier may have been behind this stance. The Dutch
government, which owns 38 per cent of KLM, insisted the company had acted on
its own. Nevertheless, six of the 11 members of KLM's supervisory board are
government appointees. As the main shareholder in Schiphol airport, the
Dutch government has no desire to see its taxpayers' money used to promote
the profits of a privatised British airline.
What lies in store for the airlines? British Airways is responding
aggressively to the downturn in its market. Its costs are falling fast, with
its workforce cut by 11 per cent this year, wage inflation down to about 4
per cent and fuel costs moderating. In the third quarter it made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 100m compared with just Pounds 20m the year before. When
passenger volumes rise, it should reap significant productivity gains.
BA will continue talking to potential partners in Europe, the Far East and
America. But its financial strength means it is in no rush to do a deal.
As for KLM, it is narrowing its losses and cutting costs. It may start talks
with other European airlines such as SAS, the Scandinavian group. Although
it is regarded in the industry as a high-quality airline, few believe KLM
has a long-term future as an independent force, as the market in Europe is
opened to more competition. A deal with either Air France or Lufthansa seems
unlikely, while a merger with SAS would not provide the size and scale
needed. Mr Philip van den Berg, an analyst at Goldman Sachs in London,
commented: 'KLM is not big enough to survive on its own, it may yet have to
return to BA for support.'
