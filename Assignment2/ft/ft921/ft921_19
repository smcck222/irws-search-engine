JD Wetherspoon, the London pubs operator which yesterday announced first
half pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 432,000 to Pounds 1.01m, is to seek a
Stock Exchange listing towards the end of the year.
It has appointed Kleinwort Benson to float 35 per cent of the company to
raise about Pounds 15m.
Mr Tim Martin, the managing director who founded the company in 1979, said
the flotation would help to accelerate expansion. During the past 13 years,
the company has grown from one free house to an estate of 37 pubs with a
turnover in the six months to January 25 of Pounds 9.6m.

<TEXT>
BANK OF Scotland is investing Pounds 6m in a 45 per cent stake in
Finanziaria Italiana Mutui, which operates in the Italian residential
mortgage market, writes James Buxton.
The move represents the Edinburgh-based bank's first move into mortgage
lending in continental Europe.
FIM is an arm of Sopaf, the Milan-based investment holding company run by Mr
Jody Vender. Sopaf intends to sell a further 10 per cent of FIM to a large
Italian insurance company, believed to be SAI, a company controlled by Mr
Salvatore Ligresti, the Italian entrepreneur.
Bank of Scotland sees the move as part of its policy of finding joint
ventures in Europe where it can add its technological and mangement skills
to local knowledge.
Two Bank of Scotland staff will join FIM and the bank will have three
boardroom seats.

FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Addison seeks Pounds 14.75m to fund AGB
purchase
</HEADLINE>

   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADDISON Consultancy, the market research group, is paying Pounds 14.75m for
the main businesses of AGB Research, part of the collapsed Maxwell private
empire.
The price of the deal was revealed yesterday in a rights issue document
designed to pay for the acquisition which will take Addison from sixth to
top position in UK market research.
Preliminary agreement on the purchase was reached with administrators Arthur
Andersen last month.
Addison, which trades as Taylor Nelson, will raise approximately Pounds
16.3m net from the rights issue which already has the support of more than
53 per cent of its share-holders.
This does not apparently include Lord Hollick's MAI group, which has 24.8
per cent of existing Addison stock. MAI says it intends to sell if the
acquisition is completed.
Under the issue holders of ordinary shares will be offered new shares at 12p
on a 9-for-4 basis.
The rights issue, which is conditional on shareholders' approval, has been
underwritten by Robert Fleming, the merchant bank.
Trading in the shares of the enlarged group is expected to begin on March
13.

FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: WPP wins Dollars 115m Mercedes contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ of North America has signed an advertising deal worth some
Dollars 115m (Pounds 65.7m) with the New York agency Scali McCabe Sloves,
part of the UK-based WPP group.
The deal, by far the largest signed in the US for many months, makes Scali
responsible for all forms of Mercedes' North American advertising, including
direct marketing.
Scali's success provides a much needed fillip for WPP, the world's largest
marketing services agency.
It is also welcome news for Scali. In November 1990 it resigned Volvo's
Dollars 40m account, which it had run for 23 years.
This brought about a sharp fall in WPP's share price, and followed
revelations that one of Scali's Volvo commercials had been rigged: Volvos
had been strengthened before undergoing a test in which trucks were driven
over them.
Negotiations are still proceeding over WPP's disposal of Scali, a move which
was agreed when WPP first acquired the agency in May 1989 as part of its
purchase of the Ogilvy &amp; Mather group.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Lord Donoughue accused on Maxwell stock lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE directors of Mirror Group Newspapers, who were also pension fund
trustees until December 1991, told a Parliamentary Select Committee
yesterday they did not know assets were disappearing from the pension fund.
Mr David Shaw MP asked the trustees if they had been told why Lord Donoughue
resigned in July 1991 from the board of Bishopsgate Investment Management,
the Maxwell-controlled company which managed most of the MGN scheme's
investments. In December 1991, Lord Donoughue said publicly he resigned
after Mr Maxwell refused to tell the trustees about BIM's stock lending. He
said he believed it had been proper but was concerned it was occurring
without his knowledge.
'Would you say that following vigorous exchanges, Robert Maxwell and Lord
Donoughue appear to have come to an understanding that Lord Donoughue should
leave the company in the full knowledge that something was wrong without
blowing the whistle?' Mr Shaw asked Mr Ernest Burrington, a trustee of MGN's
pension fund until Mr Maxwell's death. 'The answer must be yes,' Mr
Burrington replied.
In a letter from his solicitor in December 1991, Lord Donoughue said he
became aware that BIM was lending stock without his knowledge and asked it
to cease. By July, he asked Mr Maxwell to notify all pension fund trustees
of its occurrence. He resigned two weeks later.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Unilever cautious despite rise in profits to Pounds 1.8bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, yesterday
reported a Pounds 10m increase in full-year pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.79bn
after seeing an 8 per cent rise in the fourth-quarter to Pounds 473m.
In spite of the improved final quarter figure, which compares with Pounds
438m a year ago, Sir Michael Angus, chairman, was cautious about immediate
prospects: 'It is difficult to predict the outlook for 1992 at a time when
so many forecasts of recovery appear to have been premature.'
Sir Michael said Unilever had shown resilience in difficult economic
conditions in some of its main markets.
Though volumes on industrial businesses had declined, consumer operations
had continued to grow, thanks in part to rapid introduction of new products.
The Gulf War and turmoil in the Soviet Union had cost the group sales and
profits, while its performance in the US and Britain had been held back by
the persistence of a recession which had proved longer and harsher than
expected.
While economic conditions in the US were not worsening, there was no
evidence they were improving.
Sales rose 2 per cent in the full year to Pounds 23.1bn against Pounds
22.7bn, and 5 per cent in the fourth quarter to Pounds 6.2bn compared with
Pounds 5.9bn. Operating margins during the year fell to 8.6 per cent from 9
per cent, due to currency movements and smaller exceptional gains than in
1990. The group incurred restructuring charges of Pounds 70m during the
year.
Cash flow was strengthened by tighter control over working capital, which
reduced net borrowings during the year to Pounds 1.5bn from Pounds 1.9bn and
cut net interest cost to Pounds 276m from Pounds 328m.
In Europe, full-year operating profit rose to Pounds 1.24bn from Pounds
1.23bn on sales of Pounds 13.7bn against Pounds 13.6bn. In North America,
volumes were static and operating profit fell to Pounds 336m from Pounds
364m on sales of Pounds 4.77bn up from Pounds 4.63bn.
Currency movements led to a drop in operating profits in the rest of the
world to Pounds 420m from Pounds 455m on sales of Pounds 4.6bn compared with
Pounds 4.46bn.
Full-year earnings per share increased 4 per cent to 61.62p (59.52p). The
final dividend is raised to 13.91p (13.3p), bringing the total to 18.94p
(18.16p).

FT  26 FEB 92 / Lonrho may seek early end to VAG deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, may negotiate an early end
to its Volkswagen/Audi import and distribution operations in the UK which
account for more than one-fifth of its worldwide turnover.
The news follows a report last month that the German car-maker had planned
to take control of the business when the existing contract expires at the
end of 1993.
But Lonrho, which is understood to be pessimistic about the future of all
non-Japanese car sales in the UK, believes it may be in its interest to
negotiate an early end to the arrangement.
Seven years ago, the pre-tax profit forecasts for 1990 for the business
operated by VAG, a Lonrho subsidiary, were around Pounds 60m.
However, last year taxable profits fell by 11 per cent to Pounds 20m from
Pounds 22.6m a year earlier.
The alternative now being considered is to negotiate an early end to the
contract this year which could be worth Pounds 160m: assets are valued at
Pounds 100m and compensation for an early cessation of the contract could be
worth another Pounds 60m.
If this happened, Lonrho would be likely to take the extra Pounds 60m above
the line, boosting this year's overall pre-tax profits.
While the extra UK profits would help mitigate this year's problems over
advance corporation tax (ACT), in the long term the loss of the UK business
would be likely to add to them.
Its 1990 accounts show that there was Pounds 79m of unused ACT because the
group does not make sufficient profits to offset fully against ACT.
VAG's pre-tax profits accounted for almost 10 per cent of Lonrho's total
pre-tax profits of Pounds 207m in the year to September 1990.
Mr Charles Pick, conglomerate analyst at Nomura, said: 'The group are
indicating that change may not necessarily be a bad thing if it comes,
especially if VAG's future profits are impaired by the rising market share
of Japanese transplant product in the UK new car market.'
VW, the leading European car-maker, is keen to control distribution in all
five European large volume markets. In recent years it has added ownership
of the Spanish and Italian operations to its control in Germany and France.
However, Lonrho remains adamant that it has not been told that Volkswagen
wants to take control of the business operated by VAG and it may still renew
the contract in 1993.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Humber coal port project scrapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS FOR Britain's largest coal import terminal have been abandoned after a
row between Associated British Ports and PowerGen, one of two electricity
generators involved in the Pounds 150m project.
It was to have been built at Immingham on the Humber. Contracts for its
construction were close to being awarded.
Scheduled to open in 1994, the terminal would have posed a serious threat to
British Coal by allowing generators to replace 10m tonnes a year of the 65m
tonnes of coal now purchased from it annually.
ABP, manager of the project, yesterday blamed cancellation on the refusal of
one generator - understood to be PowerGen - to agree to sign final contracts
this week. The other generator involved in the project is National Power.
Sir Keith Stuart, ABP's chairman, said: 'We finally decided that enough was
enough.'
ABP has had parliamentary permission to develop the site since June 1990 and
still wants to go ahead with the project for other dry goods. 'We have lost
valuable time,' Sir Keith said.
It was claimed yesterday that PowerGen had asked ABP to delay the final
signing of the project until after the general election.
'The Labour party had a go at them and said they would let the terminal rot
if they got in,' a senior coal industry executive said.
'PowerGen is not a big partner in the project, and they were prepared to
hold off till after the election, but ABP forced the pace,' he said.
Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow energy secretary, said the Labour party had made
it clear that the coal terminal would have been 'a white elephant' under a
Labour government.
PowerGen acknowledged it had not welcomed the political attention focused on
the project, especially after it was disclosed last week that the contracts
were about to be signed.
The company stressed, however, that it had not agreed when the final
signature would take place.
'Our negotiations on this deal were ongoing and we believe the action ABP
has taken is precipitous,' the company said.
PowerGen denied it lacked commitment to the terminal project, which it had
itself initiated. National Power said ABP's decision was 'not in accordance
with the company's wishes'.
Both generators will now look at alternative import terminal projects.
ABP will now seek other ways of developing the Immingham site. Because of
lack of capacity at Immingham, many of ABP's existing customers would be
interested in new facilities, ABP said.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Names reassured on Lloyd's probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DISPUTE over the appointment of Sir David Walker to head an inquiry into
alleged malpractices at the Lloyd's insurance market was defused yesterday
at a meeting between Conservative MPs, leading Names and the market
authorities.
Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of an action group of Names - individuals
whose wealth backs underwriting - said he was now convinced of the
independence of Sir David, chairman of the Securities and Investment Board,
who also attended yesterday's meeting.
Sir David's appointment on Friday followed allegations in parliament that
Names working in the market were benefiting at the expense of outside Names.
The Lloyd's Council admitted yesterday that 'some syndicates with a greater
than average participation of external Names are syndicates that have
incurred very substantial losses from catastrophe business'.
This was 'based on a snap-shot at a point in time' and did not 'necessarily
indicate that these syndicate compositions result from improper practice in
the allocation of syndicate capacity'. It was necessary to examine 'how the
composition has developed over time'.
The admission came in a dossier, provided to Names and MPs, drawn up in
response to questions raised by Mr Paul Marland, a Conservative MP who is
also a Lloyd's Name.
Earlier in the week some Names had questioned the appointment of Sir David,
who is also a member of the Lloyd's Council, the market's governing body.
Mr Doll-Steinberg, representing Names on catastrophe reinsurance syndicates
formerly managed by Gooda Walker agency, said he was impressed with Sir
David's forthrightness.
'We had some reservations at the beginning, but having heard him and met
him, whatever reservations we had have been unconditionally withdrawn.'
Together with a delegation of four Conservative MPs, including Sir William
Clark, chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, and three other
Names' leaders, Mr Doll-Steinberg met Sir David and leaders of the Lloyd's
market, including Mr David Coleridge, chairman, and Mr Alan Lord, chief
executive, yesterday.
Names on Gooda Walker, which managed a number of syndicates that have
suffered devastating losses in 1989 and 1990, are among those seeking
injunctions to prevent Lloyd's drawing down from the Names' funds to meet
cash calls.
Sir William said he had received 'categorical assurances' that Sir David's
terms of reference would be 'as wide as anything'.
Sir David would be able to investigate any allegation, he said.

FT  26 FEB 92 / US consumer confidence falls sharply: Blow to campaigning
Bush as Greenspan concedes that figures are 'quite disturbing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US CONSUMER confidence dropped sharply this month to the lowest level since
1974, raising fresh doubts about the outlook for economic recovery. The news
was a blow to President George Bush, who is on the campaign trail trying to
win support from disgruntled middle-income voters.
The Conference Board, a New York-based business consultancy group, said its
widely followed index of confidence fell to 46.3 from a revised 50.2 in
January, the fifth consecutive monthly decline.
Confidence is more than 30 points below the levels recorded during last
summer's stuttering recovery and well under half the level that would
indicate a strong economy.
Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, yesterday repeated his
prediction that the business climate would improve shortly. But testifying
before the Senate banking committee, he was distinctly less upbeat than in
his testimony last week.
The confidence figures were 'quite disturbing', he said. The Fed had to be
'particularly sensitive to signs that the anticipated strengthening in
business activity is not emerging and be prepared to act should the need
arise'.
recovery should not be exaggerated and warned that the incipient recovery
'could peter out, as indeed the much more vigorous recovery of last spring
petered out'.
Senator Donald Riegle, the Democrat chairman of the banking committee,
called for a more aggressive monetary policy, telling Mr Greenspan: 'I think
you are too passive.'
On Wall Street, the confidence figures and Mr Greenspan's more bearish
remarks renewed hopes that the Fed might cut interest rates again.
The long bond was up a third of a point in late trading having surged on
release of the confidence figures. Shares fell on fears of a fresh delay in
recovery, although they finished above the day's lows. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average lost 24.59 at 3,257.83.
The dollar rebounded strongly in late US trading as the currency market
shrugged off the seemingly gloomy data. It closed in New York at DM1.6575
after dropping to DM1.6395 in London. Analysts said the most worrying aspect
of the survey was a sharp decline in a component measuring future
expectations. This fell to 62.2 compared with 68.7 last month and over 100
last summer, suggesting that consumers have become much more pessimistic.
Mr Fabian Linden, for the Conference Board, said the consumer's prime
concern was job security.
Mr Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said the
figures made a cut in interest rates likely, probably after next week's
employment report.

FT  26 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Coal imports
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AB Ports' decision to pull out of the proposed development for coal imports
at its Immingham deep-water facility was a surprisingly blunt reaction to a
request for a delay from PowerGen. Granted, the issue of coal imports has
become a hot political potato. The two electricity generators are in the
throes of negotiations with the government over future contracts with
British Coal, and are doubtless also worried by the possibility that a
Labour government would take a tough line on imports. But it is hard to see
why AB Ports should have called such lucrative proceedings to a pre-emptory
halt when it will presumably have to fund any alternative project itself.
As for what the disappearance of perhaps 10m tonnes of import capacity will
mean for the generators further out, it seems safe to assume that National
Power will now decide to develop a facility in Teesside as well as Bristol
and Hull, while arguably PowerGen had somewhat less need of Immingham in the
first place. If UK coal is a little less expensive compared to imports, so
much the better for British Coal. A deal before the election seems more
likely than ever.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would have been nice for the UK government if yesterday's Spanish rate
cut had created some leeway for sterling in the ERM. In the event, the pound
remained at its floor against the peseta and both currencies slipped against
the D-Mark. If there is to be a UK interest rate cut before the election, it
looks as though the government will simply have to ignore the ERM constraint
and hope the peseta continues to move with sterling.
That is a risky course, which probably explains why the authorities appear
bent on deferring action as long as possible. The danger of delay is that a
poll-conscious market might infer that the government had lost faith in its
ability to win the election. In that case the opportunity to cut might never
materialise.

FT  26 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: NatWest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The starting point for a consideration of National Westminster's results is
scarcely encouraging. Here is a bank effectively paying a maintained
dividend out of capital raised from the market last year. It has only
belatedly got round to tightening up its lending practices despite running
up Pounds 1.9bn in provisions. Operating costs are running well ahead of
inflation. Such a past does not easily lend itself to expectations of a
glowing future.
To be fair, buoyant commission income helped boost operating profits by 20
per cent compared with just 14 per cent at Lloyds. Yet, if earnings do
rebound this year, it will be largely because of falling provisions in the
US, spiced by some Dollars 1bn in tax credits carried forward by a now
profitable National Westminster Bancorp. There will hardly be a repeat of
the Pounds 111m write-back of provisions on problem country debt, however,
or of the Pounds 52m credit from release of provisions by 3i. So the bank
will have to make up some ground just to match 1991's pre-tax profits of
Pounds 110m.
Even assuming NatWest is right to expect some fall in UK provisions this
year - and Lloyds takes a somewhat less sanguine view - earnings are
unlikely to do much more than cover a maintained dividend in 1992. The lack
of profit retention may not matter if loan demand stays weak, but then
backers of the shares as a recovery stock might ask where growth will come
from in the medium term. The bank cannot squeeze extra commission out of its
customers indefinitely.

FT  26 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Unilever
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the benefit of hindsight Unilever's chairman Sir Michael Angus might
have chosen another year in which to unveil valedictory results.
Recessionary scars on both sides of the Atlantic were obviously reflected in
yesterday's 1 per cent pre-tax profits and 4 per cent earnings advance in
calendar 1991. Even so, the 1 per cent underlying volume increase looks a
touch pedestrian set beside Nestle and BSN. No doubt the market's response
in marking Unilever's shares 3 per cent lower was compounded by publication
of one of the gloomiest US consumer confidence indicators since the
mid-1970s.
What really stands out is the company's formidable balance sheet strength.
Net debt was nearly Pounds 3bn in mid-1990, but with the 4P packaging
company proceeds and promised sale of the agricultural businesses, plus a
continuing working capital squeeze, that figure could be not far above
Pounds 1bn by the end of the year. A lower interest bill ought to maintain
the profits momentum in the absence of an upturn. European margins,
meanwhile, already boosted a point or so by the sale of poor performing oil
milling, paper and agricultural merchanting businesses, are set to reach
double figures with the cost-cutting benefits of the single market
programme. Given the huge medium-term potential the shares are well worth
holding for an earnings multiple just 5 per cent higher than the market
average.

ECC's decision to repay the bulk of its US auction market preferred stock
(AMPS) with the proceeds of a Pounds 200m rights issue will do little to
calm jitters in a once fashionable corner of the securities market. It
always seemed imprudent for companies to build a substantial part of their
capital structure on an instrument which relied on a tax concession for its
efficiency; the strategy becomes that much more unwise when the relative
cost of servicing starts to increase. ECC's decision will no doubt revive
discussion about how AMPS are to be treated under revised rules from the
UK's Accountancy Standards Board. Common sense suggests they should be
included as debt for cover purposes in the profit and loss account. The
unfortunate example of Ratners demonstrates that in balance sheet terms they
can more legitimately be counted as equity.
ECC, though, is very far from the Ratners league and investors, encouraged
by a much better than expected profit forecast, shrugged aside the cash call
with a 7p increase in the shares. It may be the new paper will put an end to
the recent outperformance of the shares. But with chief executive Andrew
Teare's touch apparently as sure as ever it would not do to count on it.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Taylor to succeed Lane as Lord Chief Justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Peter Taylor, the Appeal Court judge who led the 1989 inquiry into the
Hillsborough football stadium disaster, is to succeed Lord Lane as Lord
Chief Justice.
Lord Justice Taylor, 61, will take over England's second most senior
judicial office at the end of April when Lord Lane steps down after 12 years
in the job.
Lord Lane, 73, could have remained until his 75th birthday in July 1993, but
'had indicated his wish to retire early', Downing Street said.
Sir Peter inherits a criminal justice system under scrutiny by a Royal
Commission after a series of miscarriages of justice which have undermined
public confidence in the judiciary and the courts.
Speaking at a press conference, he conceded there was widespread public
anxiety about the criminal justice system and said: 'We have all got a job
to do.'
He called for a different approach by police to the investigation of crime
and for greater vigilance on the part of the judiciary. Judges had to
maintain their independence but should be encouraged to be more
'user-friendly'.
Asked about recent controversial awards of libel damages, Lord Justice
Taylor said that juries would continue to make large awards unless the
'toothless Press Complaints Commission' was given wider powers to impose
financial sanctions on newspapers which overstepped the mark.
In recent years Lord Lane has been increasingly dogged by controversy.
He was heavily criticised for his handling of the first appeal of the
Birmingham Six in 1988 when he said 'the longer this hearing has gone on,
the more convinced this court has become that the verdict of the jury was
correct'.
His refusal to apologise to the men when they were finally released in March
last year led more than 100 MPs to sign an early day motion calling for his
resignation.
Lord Justice Taylor had been widely tipped to succeed Lord Lane in spite of
having been an Appeal Court judge for only 3 1/2 years.
He said he thought he had been appointed because he was seen as 'not wholly
out of touch with the mainstream of life in the country'.
His appointment was widely welcomed by the legal profession.
Mr Gareth Williams QC, chairman of the Bar, said: 'It is time for a fresh
start and Lord Justice Taylor is just the man to carry out the essential
task of reform.'

FT  26 FEB 92 / Personal View: Arts funding, too precious to be a political
drama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PALUMBO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President George Bush's removal of Mr John Frohnmayer, chairman of the
National Endowment for the Arts, illustrates what happens when politicians
meddle in art. Mr Frohnmayer's tenure of office demonstrated what has long
been known at the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Endowment's UK
counterpart: namely that artists need freedom to experiment, and that
freedom can be costly and controversial.
The Arts Council spends Pounds 200m annually on the arts under protection of
its royal charter. Its chief executive is accountable to parliament. The
system provides a buffer from political interference.
In an election year in the UK, not surprisingly siren voices have already
been calling for direct ministerial funding of the arts' 'flagships',
including the Royal Opera House and the Royal Shakespeare Company. At
present these organisations receive grants from the Arts Council, whose
experts assess artistic quality - that elusive category  - and their value
for money.
It may be tempting for a new arts minister to short-circuit this process and
send the cheques himself, but the consequences of such a move would be
serious. It would ride roughshod over the 'arm's length' principle of
keeping politicians away from 'artistic' decisions (contrived by Lord
Keynes, the Arts Council's founder and first chairman); and it would store
up significant political fall-out, since the minister would then have to
provide detailed answers in the Commons on questions relating to everything
from Hamlet's father's ghost to the cost of costumes in a production of the
Ring Cycle. Direct funding of the arts remains an unattractive political
option.
This does not mean the arts are politically unimportant. It means a
distinction must be drawn between an effective public policy to support the
arts and the practical means to carry it out.
A recent independent survey for the Arts Council revealed that 71 per cent
of respondents values the arts as a prime contributor to the quality of
life; and 69 per cent supports public investment in the arts. In 1990, 17m
adults regularly attended more than one type of arts event. In the past five
years opera audiences have risen 15 per cent; jazz by 10 per cent. Last year
100m people visited art galleries and museums, far more than attended
football matches. Later this year the Arts Council will unveil its national
arts and media strategy which aims to take account of the changing patterns
of leisure and participation in the arts. The Arts Council will look to a
new government to assist it in carrying out the national strategy.
However, there is another reason why British politicians should pay
attention to the arts: they make money, in fact more money than the UK motor
industry. How?
Arts expenditure: the total estimated spending on the arts in 1990-91 was
Pounds 1.5bn - modest in the context of the UK gross domestic product of
Pounds 547bn. The Pounds 1.5bn provides for libraries, the Arts Council,
military bands, museums and galleries and new arts buildings.
Arts income: according to the Treasury, the arts contributed Pounds 6bn to
the UK balance of payments in 1990. This figure includes the sale of works
of art, publishing, television and film royalties and arts expenditures in
tourism. By contrast, the value of UK vehicle exports in 1990 totalled
Pounds 4bn.
On the basis of this evidence, television news ought to carry stories
nightly about the arts industry, displacing the familiar litanies of Rover.
But this is unlikely.
The 'big issues' in the election will be health, education, defence and
taxation. Scarcely any other issue receives detailed public scrutiny. So
what do the main political parties have to offer the arts?
The Conservatives promise 'an expanding partnership between the state and
the private sector', pointing to the success of the government's business
sponsorship incentive scheme which has produced Pounds 30m annually of
business support. In spite of talk of 'incentives for the successful
development of the arts', no new fiscal measures have yet been mentioned by
the government despite indications that a national lottery might be included
in the manifesto.
Labour has produced arts policy documents, including the crafts, design,
women in the arts and architecture. Its 'big idea' is a new ministry of arts
and media. The Arts Council is to remain. The party also proposes new
statutory responsibilities for local authorities. However, a 'weak'
obligation to support the arts placed upon local councils might produce an
extra Pounds 50m-Pounds 100m bill for the environment secretary. Labour has
also made noises of approval for a national lottery to support the arts,
sports and the environment.
Like Labour, the Liberals promise a single ministry for the arts. They
undertake to provide increased public funding for the arts 'up to the
European Community average', which suggests a quadrupling of the Arts
Council's grant. They also promise to abolish entrance charges to museums
and galleries.
The Scottish National party's policy for the arts is predicated on the
belief that Scotland's national culture is under threat from the dominant
culture of England. The SNP promises a national theatre for Scotland, and
action to safeguard traditional folk arts.
So far so good. One big difference between the forthcoming election and that
of 1987 is that the political parties seem to have taken the arts more
seriously. But the general principle, pace Mr Frohnmayer, is that the arts
are too precious a resource to be the subject of radical party political
differences. What is undoubtedly clear is that the arts will be remembered
long after Ecu and Emu are forgotten.
Lord Palumbo is chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain

No one would have guessed a year ago that Michael Freeman, the solicitor
leading the legal battle against the Lloyd's establishment, would have been
catapulted into the headlines. His eponymous firm is better known for its
commercial law expertise than for its insurance know-how.
However, just over a year ago he was approached by members of the Oakeley
Vaughan syndicate who had become frustrated at the way their case against
the Corporation of Lloyd's was being handled. Not the sort of names to let
their affairs go by default, they decided to abandon the respected City firm
of Elborne Mitchell and head up west to find a tough, commercial lawyer. One
of their number, Sir William Pigott-Brown, had recommended Freeman.
The appointment achieved the desired effect. Pleadings were amended,
evidence redrafted and general consternation created. Perhaps it was natural
that, having no connection with the City, Freeman should develop a
pronounced sympathy for his clients' plight.
His speedy mastery of the inner workings of Lloyd's, coupled with his
successful background in commercial litigation, made it almost inevitable
that he would be leading the crusade when it set off. He has a powerful
mastery of oratory - probably too abrasive a style for a QC, but just the
tonic for spurring depressed and impoverished members of Lloyd's.

Harry Turner has been having a tough time lately and yesterday's events did
nothing to lighten his mood. The Law Lords took only ten minutes to turn
down TSW's judicial review of the loss of its franchise to Westcountry
Television. Turner, TSW's flamboyant managing director, is writing a book on
the ITV franchise fiasco right up to the denouement in the House of Lords.
The unfortunate fellow will also have to confess that he not only lost a
franchise by bidding too high, he was also taken in along the way by the
notorious conman Joe Flynn. Using a variety of false names, Flynn has been
extracting 'expenses' from national newspapers, governments and intelligence
agencies for years.
His recent targets have included investigative journalist Seymour Hersh and
Matthew Evans, chairman of Faber &amp; Faber, over Robert Maxwell's alleged
involvement in the Vanunu affairs.
In the middle of the ITV franchise process Flynn suggested that senior
members of the TSW staff were in cahoots with the opposition and came up
with corroborative evidence in the form of home telephone numbers.
In all, Joe Flynn cost TSW Pounds 4,000 - a drop in the ocean compared with
the lawyers' bills.

Unilever's results may have failed to set the City alight yesterday. But
nothing was going to deter outgoing chairman Sir Michael Angus from
celebrating his last annual press conference in inimitable knockabout style.
First, there was the teasing build-up to a showing of a 'banned' video. It
turned out to be the commercial for 'I Can't Believe It's Not Butter]'. The
vegetable-fat spread's promotion - depicting a truly sickly yuppie couple
getting back together over a cake - was banned from British television
because it fell foul of EC advertising regulations. On reflection, Angus
admitted, viewers had some reason to be glad that the Independent Television
Commission had kept it off their screens.
Then followed a story about his 'stimulating' staircase encounter with a
Swedish model who features in another Unilever campaign. Finally, Angus
regaled everyone with a collection of his favourite limericks before
repairing to the hospitality suite to do battle with a large and sticky
'Magnum' ice cream. It will be interesting to see if he keeps up this sort
of behaviour when he takes over as president of the CBI.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Observer: Filling the Italian job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The selection of a new head of Confindustria, the Italian industrialists'
confederation, has been turned into confusion following the withdrawal of
the candidature of Fiat boss Cesare Romiti.
The 68-year-old Romiti emerged as the unquestionable choice among
Confindustria members to succeed Sergio Pininfarina, who has held this key
job as chief spokesman for the private sector of Italian industry since
1988. But his candidature became a question of conflicting loyalties.
Confindustria needs a prominent industrialist who can deal from a position
of authority both with the government and with the unions. However, Romiti
has also proved himself equally invaluable to Fiat's ruling Agnelli family.
A tough, even authoritarian, manager, he helped steer the group through a
bitter period of industrial strife in the 1970s. Although he has gathered
around him a team of executives in their late 40s, his departure would have
posed a big problem for the Fiat management at a time when the group,
especially the automotive sector, is being squeezed by recession and
increased international competition.
Indeed, the refusal of Gianni Agnelli, the Fiat boss and one of the three
'wise men' selecting the next head of Confindustria, to release him
underlines how much the group has come to depend upon him. This is all the
more so when Gianni Agnelli, 70, is preparing for the succession of his
younger brother, the 57-year-old Umberto.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Capitalist tool in need of sharpening: As former communist
countries look to the IMF to aid their transition to the market, Michael
Prowse examines the role of the fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund has rarely been in greater demand. It is on
the verge of completing membership negotiations with Russia and other former
Soviet republics. Already heavily committed in eastern Europe, it has
emerged as the west's principal instrument for assisting the transition to
capitalism in formerly centrally planned economies.
Most policymakers seem to take the IMF's central role in guiding economic
reform in the former communist countries - as well as in scores of
developing countries - largely for granted. Yet it marks a startling
transition for an institution that was established for a quite different
purpose. The IMF was created at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 to run
an international monetary system based on fixed exchange rates and limited
capital mobility.
The Bretton Woods system disintegrated in the early 1970s creating an
identity crisis for the IMF. At the time, many experts feared that its
influence as a global financial institution would gradually wane. Instead,
the IMF cast about for new roles. It helped recycle oil surpluses in the
1970s and involved itself increasingly with economic reform in developing
countries. In the early 1980s, it was back on centre stage, managing the
Third World debt crisis.
During the 1980s, the IMF was often criticised for excessively austere
policies, especially in heavily indebted Latin American countries. Much of
the criticism has melted away. Indeed, most observers today appear to have
an exaggerated faith in its ability to work economic miracles.
The changing perception of the IMF reflects a shift in world opinion: the
policies of economic liberalism and fiscal responsibility that it has always
championed are now uncontroversial. Indeed, some recent clients have wanted
to 'out-IMF the IMF'. In Czechoslovakia, Mr Vaclav Klaus, the finance
minister, is a more committed disciple of market forces than many IMF
officials. In Latin America, even as recalcitrant a pupil as Argentina is
now proposing a programme of economic reforms that makes the Bush
administration look dirigiste.
But observers argue that the IMF has also shifted ground to meet criticisms.
It talks more about growth and less about balance of payments
'stabilisation'. It seems more aware of the impact of its policies on
poverty, income distribution and the environment.
Mr Moeen Qureshi, until recently head of operations at the World Bank, says
Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director since 1987, deserves much
of the credit for the changes. Mr Camdessus has 'anticipated challenges and
shown a greater capacity for leadership' than any of his recent
predecessors, he says. Under Mr Camdessus's leadership, the IMF has:
Lengthened the duration of economic adjustment programmes and begun to put
more weight on structural reforms;
Recognised the need for special concessional treatment - in effect aid  -
for the poorest countries, especially in Africa;
Taken a more lenient view of countries in arrears, in some cases allowing
the effective rescheduling of fund loans;
Spoken up on sensitive political issues such as excessive military spending
in developing countries.
Mr Qureshi stresses that Mr Camdessus received little support from western
finance ministers when fighting for such changes and often had to overcome
opposition from a conservative old guard within the IMF. He is a 'one-man
band to such an extent that the rest of the staff are often not on the same
wavelength'.
Mr Camdessus's reforms, which built on changes already under way in the
early 1980s, have helped create a more positive image for the IMF. But do
its economic remedies actually work? Mr Jacques Polak, a former senior IMF
official who retains close links with the institution, recently reviewed
academic assessments of IMF performance. He found the evidence was 'not as
conclusive as one would like'.
IMF programmes have tended to improve the balance of payments - which is
hardly surprising given that this is their central aim. But the impact on
inflation and living standards is, at best, uncertain. His review provides
little evidence of a strong positive correlation between IMF programmes and
growth.
Glancing at the IMF's latest annual report points to a similar conclusion.
At the back you will see long lists of developing countries that have had
numerous IMF programmes (the champion is Haiti with 21), yet which still
remain deeply troubled economically. For every Mexico, you can find a dozen
poor performers.
The early results in eastern Europe are equally disappointing. 'The
underlying reality,' says a World Bank official, 'is extremely gloomy.'
Output is down sharply everywhere and there are few signs yet that private
enterprise can fill the gap left by collapsed state enterprises. Poland is
already backing away from the austere policies initially agreed with the
IMF. Czechoslovakia is growing restive. Mr Richard Erb, the IMF's deputy
managing director, concedes that declines in output have been 'a lot bigger
than we expected' but argues that nobody has put forward convincing
alternative policies.
The disappointing results do not imply that IMF policies are necessarily
misguided. Mr Polak suggests that it reflects the failure of countries to
pursue the policies consistently. But the fact that the IMF finds itself in
a long-term relationship of dubious value with many clients indicates
something is wrong. After decades of effort, suggests one former IMF
official, 'a certain cynicism has set in'. He says many officials are not
'success-oriented': they negotiate tough programmes that fail to heed
political realities and then 'wait for them to break down'.
Part of the problem lies in the mismatch between the IMF's responsibilities
and its original charter. It was meant to provide short-term bridging
finance for countries experiencing temporary balance of payments problems.
This led naturally to a focus on policies  - such as devaluation and fiscal
and monetary retrenchment - that would quickly bring demand into line with
an economy's short-run capacity to produce. The more difficult development
challenge of creating the conditions for sustainable growth formed no part
of its remit.
The IMF seems likely to get bogged down in eastern Europe and the former
Soviet republics for many years: the evidence from Latin America and Africa
is that it is rarely possible quickly to stabilise an under-developed
economy and then withdraw. Mr Camdessus seems to relish the prospect of
turning the IMF into a long-term development agency. But some question
whether this is the right goal for an institution whose primary expertise
lies in short-run macroeconomic management.
The irony is that, while the IMF's case load has soared, putting enormous
pressure on its hard-working staff, the rationale for some of its functions
 -and those of the World Bank - may be diminishing. A few blocks east of the
IMF's grand building on 19th Street in Washington, a small group called
Sachs and Associates has opened its doors. The non-profit consultancy, which
is headed by Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, provides
economic advice to Russia and eastern European governments.
In April, another innovative group, the Emerging Markets Corporation (EMC),
will open in Washington. The founders include Mr Qureshi and Mr Donald Roth,
formerly the World Bank's senior financial officer. EMC regards itself as an
entrepreneurial version of the International Finance Corporation, the World
Bank's arm for promoting private sector development. EMC hopes to add value
by locating profitable opportunities for direct and portfolio investment in
developing countries and the formerly centrally planned economies.
Public sector agencies will always have a crucial role in crises such as
mediating between creditors and bankrupt borrowers and in helping the
poorest countries. But flexible groups such as Sachs and Associates and EMC,
rather than the Bretton Woods dinosaurs, could represent the future in
development advice and finance.
What do developing countries need? The answer, first, is a genuine
commitment to reform: signing up for an IMF or Bank programme is not
necessarily evidence of good faith. The other requirements are sound advice
and money. There is little reason to suppose that Mr John Odling-Smee, the
head of the IMF's department for former Soviet republics, can offer better
economic advice than the equally knowledgeable Prof Sachs.
Going one step further, on the IMF's own market principles, it seems
improbable that its 1,200 economists, corralled into bureaucratic
departments, are realising their full potential. Might it make more sense to
split them into autonomous competing groups like the 15-strong Sachs and
Associates? If such groups charged fees, they could be sure their advice was
really welcome. Advisers whose policies worked would gradually gain business
at the expense of the less successful.
As for finance, the US Congress is baulking at providing an extra Dollars
12bn for the IMF's long-promised quota increase. In the medium term, most
resources for investment in former planned economies and the Third World
will be supplied by private capital markets that are larger and more liquid
than envisaged by the IMF's founders. The bulk will probably be direct and
portfolio investment flows. Companies such as EMC could thus become key
conduits for development finance.
At present, the IMF plays a catalytic role. Mr Odling-Smee and Prof Sachs
may endorse identical programmes of reforms but Mr Odling-Smee's signature
is far more valuable, because many lenders and investors lack the confidence
to commit resources without the IMF imprimatur. This suggests a need for a
rating agency of some kind: if Sachs and Associates could win a AAA rating
for a proposed reform programme from an impartial agency, it, too, might be
able to unlock a flood of private sector capital. The advantage of lots of
small independent advisers in place of the hierarchical IMF would be greater
innovation in the design of reform programmes.
For now, the IMF must take a lead role in Russia and elsewhere. But if
independent advisers were to flourish it could focus more closely on the
task Keynes and others originally conceived for it: the running of a world
monetary system. 'My big criticism of the IMF,' says Mr John Williamson, an
economist at the Institute for International Finance, a Washington
think-tank, 'is its lack of work on economic policy co-ordination.'
The proper surveillance of macroeconomic policies in the industrialised
world ought to be next big item on Mr Camdessus's agenda, says Mr Qureshi.
He argues that Japan's big current account surplus and its alleged import
barriers form a classic example of the kind of problem the IMF ought to
tackle. Referring to President George Bush's ill-received recent visit to
Tokyo, he argues that the disinterested Mr Camdessus, rather than a
political leader, should have raised questions about unfair trade practices.
'This would represent a genuine extension of a new world economic order.'
The IMF can play the role for which it was designed only if the leading
industrial countries cede it more power to monitor and co-ordinate exchange
rate and other macroeconomic policies. At present, they are denying it this
crucial responsibility while pushing it ever further into development tasks
for which it is still not fully prepared, despite Mr Camdessus's
innovations.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the spate of Irish lyricism that we have recently had in London from
Dublin, here is a touch of the harder stuff from the north. Ron Hutchinson's
Pygmies in the Ruins, which opened last November at the Lyric Theatre,
Belfast, to praise on this page from Antony Thorncroft, is billed as a
thriller and certainly has elements of suspense; an English audience,
however, might be more interested in what it tells us about the current
state of Northern Ireland. The piece suggests that such is the cumulative,
meaningless violence, a touch of hysteria is setting in.
The central character Washburn, played by Ian McEihinney, is a police
photographer who periodically goes mad because he cannot make sense of what
he is seeing. Whereas the rest of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is either
getting out or looking forward to going on holiday in Florida, Washburn is
obsessed by seeking a pattern in the killings.
Yet there is a twist. This is not a conventional play about modern Ulster.
Instead Hutchinson looks back to the Ireland of 1871 when the industrial
revolution was at its height and Belfast was a thriving, thrusting city, far
outstripping Dublin, which that particular revolution never touched. Belfast
indeed had some claim to be the second city in the empire in terms of
prosperity.
There were unexplained killings then, just as there are unexplained killings
now. Hutchinson juxtaposes the two periods and asks the question, through
Washburn, who are the people of the north? Is the damage inflicted on them
from the outside, or do they do it to themselves?
It is not Hutchinson's fault that he fails to provide the answer. If there
is one, it has eluded everyone else. But it must be clear by now that -
Yugoslavia apart - Northern Ireland is a pretty peculiar place by the
standards of contemporary Europe. That is what the play is about.
The pygmies are the people of modern Belfast scrabbling about in the ruins
of a once great entrepreneurial city. It may have been built partly on
corruption, but at least it had a sense of purpose. 'A thriving, prosperous
Belfast, northern sister to ancient Dublin,' says one of the 19th century
characters, 'is the best hope for an Ireland that will gather in her exiled
sons and daughters . . . Dublin faces England and the past - Belfast faces
the world and the coming century.'
Of the several things that I admire about a far-from-perfect play, one is
the absence of any overt propaganda. This is a distinctive Irish voice
saying something different. There are also no stereotypes, whether gunmen,
priests, poets, revolutionaries or tinkers. Hutchinson suggests that Belfast
is about money; he does not rub it in too much that money is part of the
protestant ethic. Religion tends to be directly confined to recurrent,
rather dismal singing of 'Hills of the North, Rejoice.' 'The hills round
Belfast,' someone says, 'would have made a good place for a crucifixion.'
The chief fault is that the piece is too long and does not know where to
end. It could finish with Washburn killing himself, as he is invited to do,
or, succumbing to hysteria, turning his his gun on any or everyone else.
That is part of the suspense.
In the event, Hutchinson settles for a lyrical ballad spoken by Washburn and
his girl-friend Nuala, played by the aptly named Fiona Victory. It tells the
tale of a man on the Shankill Road who tried to slit his wife's throat, then
hanged himself because he could not bear the blood.
The woman survived and the man died; 'For the razor-blade was Dublin-made,
But the rope was Belfast linen.' In that, as in much of the rest of the
play, there is a touch of Louis MacNeice.
The production, in association with the Lyric Players Theatre, Belfast, is
directed by Eoin O'Callaghan. I found it pretty well faultless.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Putting brakes on the bus
cartel - Leslie Crawford breathes the smog in Santiago / Urban air pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SANTIAGO'S chronic smog obliterates its most stunning landmark. The towering
Andes that once formed the backdrop to the Chilean capital now exist only in
the memories of long-suffering residents and the postcards bought by
tourists.
Although Santiago has no heavy industry to speak of, and its population
(4.5m) is only a fraction of Sao Paulo's or Mexico City's, it nevertheless
rivals these heavyweights for the dubious distinction of being Latin
America's most polluted city.
The reasons for this lie in the capital's untrammelled growth and its dry
climate, but above all in misguided free-market policies which encouraged
the development of the most chaotic, inefficient and costly public transport
system in Latin America.
Chile's former military government lifted controls on bus transport from
1975 onwards until there were no restrictions on routes or fares. Anyone who
owned a bus could drive it wherever they pleased. As a result, there are
more than 14,000 buses trundling through Santiago. Most run half empty,
spewing out diesel fumes and thick clouds of soot from their engines.
Deregulation did not bring about a fall in fares. The lack of alternative
transport allows Santiago's 4,000 bus owners to operate a cartel, which
controls a Dollars 250m-a-year business and rigs prices to mask
inefficiencies.
But to grasp the full extent of Santiago's smog problems, one must add
430,000 other vehicles to Santiago's bus fleet, the dust from 700km of
unpaved roads and wood burning in homes. The amount of particulate matter -
dust, soot, and a choice blend of mutagenic agents - never falls below twice
the accepted international health standards. In winter, when a mass of cold
air traps the smog near ground level, the concentration of breathable
particles can increase five-fold, forcing the closure of schools and
industry. Drivers face restrictions of varying degrees for nine months of
the year.
Hospitals are overwhelmed by the number of patients with respiratory
diseases as soon as the autumn sets in. Their waiting rooms overflow with
children attached to vaporisers - a kind of oxygen mask that unblocks
obstructed lungs. Pneumonia has become the main cause of infant mortality in
Santiago.
The military regime, which stepped down in March 1990, suppressed the
results of medical research on the deteriorating health of its inhabitants.
President Patricio Aylwin's government has made a brave stab at the problem
since taking office less than two years ago. However, its greatest success
so far has been political. After an acrimonious year-long conflict with the
bus owners' cartel, the Ministry of Transport succeeded in forcing the
retirement of the oldest 2,600 buses in circulation with compensation for
their owners.
It also put the city's bus routes to tender in an effort to rationalise
services and ease traffic flow. This was at first boycotted by the cartel,
but its members caved in. The new services, scheduled to begin next month,
were awarded on a point system that gave top marks to operators offering
newer buses and lower fares.
'Putting the bus routes out to tender has effectively broken the cartel
because operators have had to compete on the basis of price and quality,'
says Juan Escudero, a transport systems analyst at Santiago's
Decontamination Commission.
Santiago's police now have the power to carry out spot checks on vehicles
belching out exhaust fumes - and order them off the streets. The government
has forbidden the import of used motors and spare parts, and from September
onwards all imported vehicles will have to come with catalytic converters.
Some of the capital's 1,000 industries are already cleaning up their act,
but the investment so far in reducing toxic emissions remains a paltry
Dollars 18m. The impact of planned tougher legislation remains uncertain
while the government lacks inspectors to enforce it.
Escudero would prefer the onus to rest on self-regulation, and he is toying
with the idea of a 'pollution bourse' where licences permitting specified
amounts of contamination could be traded. This would force industries to
factor their emissions as an economic cost.
If the idea sounds strange, consider some of the other proposals seriously
put forward:
Blowing up mountains to the north and south of the capital to create an air
vent.
Rain-making machines.
Fans to lift the smog.
The proposals reflect, perhaps, how desperate Santiago's inhabitants are to
improve their environment. When the first electric trolley-buses reappeared
last month after 14 years, a trio of old ladies, alighting for the first
time, knelt before the conductor and blessed the bus.
Next week's article will focus on Tokyo.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Paper chase - David Lascelles
examines National Westminster Bank's pioneering green audit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank, the UK's second largest clearing bank, is not the
sort of company that belches smoke into the sky or empties chemical waste
into rivers.
But it does employ close to 100,000 people, run a fleet of 7,000 vehicles,
own 4,000 separate properties, and consume mountains of paper and office
equipment. So it cannot ignore the impact this has on the environment.
Nearly a year and a half ago, NatWest decided to try to assess that impact
and see what it should do about it. In conjunction with Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Deloitte, the accountancy firm, it embarked on an environmental audit of its
entire domestic operations. 'We literally lifted manhole covers and looked
into the drains,' says Hilary Thompson, head of the bank's environmental
management unit.
Although the purpose was partly altruistic (the bank's new chairman, Lord
Alexander, is keen on environmental issues), it was also economic insofar as
NatWest wanted to reduce costs. It was even defensive to the extent that
NatWest wanted to rebut criticism and prove that it was willing to set an
example.
The results of the audit will be published in stages during this year
through to October when the programme should be complete. But already work
on the support services sector, the largest consumer of supplies and
equipment in the bank, and UK retail banking is well advanced, and a picture
is beginning to emerge.
The audit is being conducted by two NatWest managers and the Coopers team.
In the support services area they looked at supplies, property management,
vehicles, information technology, catering and links with suppliers.
Some of these pose obvious questions: how to make buildings more energy
efficient, or vehicles more environmentally friendly, which the bank was
addressing already. NatWest is taking the sort of steps you would expect,
such as raising the quality of its buildings and 'greening' its vehicle
fleet. It is also looking at waste management to ensure that in cleaning out
its rubbish it is not merely shifting the problem somewhere else - a
requirement that will have statutory force in the UK from next April.
A specific problem for banks is paper. NatWest has its own printing
division, and the audit examined ways of raising the level of recycled
paper. But there are limits to what can be done here. One obstacle is an
industry-wide agreement among banks on the quality of paper used in cheques
which prevents them being recycled. This would have to be amended if a lower
quality was to be accepted.
The paper issue also involved examining the policies of paper suppliers to
ensure that they met NatWest's standards and would not cause the bank any
embarrassment.
On the information technology side, the audit checked the energy efficiency
of equipment, and asked questions like, what is it made of, is it
disposable? Experts looked at the software to see whether it could be made
to run more efficiently. A technical unit has also been set up to vet new
equipment.
Thompson declines to discuss the audit's findings in detail at this stage.
But she says that the exercise has been helpful in identifying a wide range
of savings. Overall, the savings possible in support services should amount
to five or six times the cost of achieving them (as opposed to the cost of
the audit itself which Thompson puts in six figures), she believes. Some of
the savings will be large, like the Pounds 750,000 that NatWest expects to
save each year on its new energy-efficient cheque processing centre in Stone
in Staffordshire, right down to the 12 per cent saving on making visiting
cards out of recycled paper.
However, the cost of actually carrying out the changes required by the audit
will be borne by the individual departments concerned on the grounds that
they will be the long-run beneficiaries. This will also drive home to
individual managers the economic message behind environmental awareness.
Getting people to take the exercise seriously is a major part of Thompson's
task. Although the initiative had board approval and is backed by senior
management headed by Derek Wanless, a deputy group chief executive,
institutional inertia and cynicism could still blunt its impact. Thompson
has set up a network of senior sector executives whose job it will be to
ensure that all the recommendations are carried out, and that the audit has
a continuing impact backed by a detailed timetable.
The intention is to have a follow-up audit in about three years' time. 'I
don't want people to see the environment as a separate issue,' she says. 'I
want them to put it in their planning.'
Aside from whatever internal benefits NatWest derives from the exercise, it
also has an external purpose too. NatWest needs to be in a position where it
can speak with some authority on environmental matters to other
organisations and businesses.
This is increasingly relevant as NatWest now has a policy of examining its
business customers' environmental record when making loan decisions. In some
cases its managers even require prospective borrowers to conduct an
environmental audit of their own (at their own expense) before they approve
a loan. This is to protect the bank against exposure to customers whose
creditworthiness could be damaged by some environmental disaster.
NatWest claims to be the leader among the UK clearing banks in appointing an
environmental supremo and conducting its audit. But other big banking
organisations have also begun to make themselves more green.
Barclays, for example, has had an energy efficiency unit operating since
1979, during which time it estimates it has saved the bank Pounds 11m. It is
also trying to extend the use of recycled paper, cut emissions from its cars
and outlaw hardwood furnishings. Lloyds and Midland have also been trying to
make themselves more green, though none has so far sought an audit of its
own.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM defends a 'prudent' rise in PSBR
 -Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday further heightened expectations of substantial tax
cuts in the March 10 Budget by saying Britain was in a better position than
ever before to 'borrow prudently'.
The prime minister's forceful justification of an increased Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) followed Labour accusations that he was
back-tracking on comments last year that extra borrowing would lead to
higher taxes.
However, Downing Street said there was no conflict, arguing that the PSBR
depends on other factors besides tax levels. Mr Major quoted comments he
made when chief secretary to the Treasury in 1987 that it would be right in
a recession to increase borrowing.
A senior Downing Street official said the disciplines of European exchange
rate mechanism membership justified the use of fiscal policy to offset the
deflationary impact of using interest rates to control sterling.
Expectations of substantial tax cuts as the centrepiece of a Tory manifesto
for an April 9 election are now widespread.
Mr Major told the Commons: 'we are now in a better position to borrow
prudently than we have been at any stage in the past - to borrow prudently
and maintain our commitment to a balanced budget in the medium term'.
Mr Major gave his ritual assurance that he could not anticipate the
proposals to be introduced by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
This was brushed aside by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, who predicted
that the additional money borrowed would be used to finance election
'bribes'.
To Labour cheers, he called on the prime minister to explain which taxes
would go up to pay for the 'bribes'.
Mr Kinnock cited a Conservative pamphlet, Transforming Britain, published
last year. In it Mr Major wrote: 'If borrowing takes the strain, taxes - not
just our taxes, but the next generation's too - have to go up to service the
debt. And inflation rises with equally calamitous results.'
Last night, however, Conservative Central Office defended Mr Major's
comments, saying they in fact highlighted 'the point we wish to drive home
about Labour' over the need for sensible tax and spending policies.
Two former Conservative chancellors, Sir Geoffrey Howe and Mr Nigel Lawson,
listened from opposite ends of the Commons chamber as Mr Major recalled how
between them they had reduced the PSBR.
Later, however, Mr Major said that Mr Lawson's decision to cut interest
rates following the 1987 stock exchange crash had been a mistake.
Mr Major also reminded Mr Kinnock that the PSBR of the last Labour
government amounted to 9 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product - Pounds
55bn at current prices.
Mr Chris Smith (Lab Islington South and Finsbury) equated borrowing to buy
votes at a general election to 'fiscal philandering of the worst kind'. The
prime minister countered that the last Labour government had cut taxes in
advance of the 1979 election 'on the back of a huge borrowing requirement'.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: A hidden hand for the opposition -
The role of Labour's backroom planner, Jim Parish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY SHUN the limelight. But even the most glittering frontbench stars would
be lost without them.
Backroom tacticians will play a critical role in communicating the general
election messages of their respective parties. None craves greater anonymity
or has a more important role to play than Labour's Mr Jim Parish.
As the party's chief campaigns officer he will act as all-purpose stage
manager-cum-technician for the scores of set-piece media events before
polling day.
Drawing on one of his favourite slim panatellas he will oversee the design
and erection of the sets, the installation of sound systems and lighting and
the entrances and exits of the dramatis personae.
These skilfully crafted backdrops exert a subtle but profound influence on
how Labour's front-line performers are perceived, particularly by television
viewers.
The political impact of a slogan which catches the popular mood, or
conversely of an unflattering set or technical glitch, could set the tone
for the entire campaign.
A gaunt figure, with a mop of greyish hair and a resemblance to actor James
Coburn, Mr Parish likens his role to that of Lilian Baylis, the stage
manager who 'used to fry eggs and bacon' in the wings of the Old Vic
theatre.
This portrait is supplemented by the comments of two reverential colleagues.
Mr Philip Gould, the party's advertising specialist, says: 'Jim is central
to the improvement in Labour's presentation.
Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour's former communications director now standing for
parliament, says: 'I used to call him my impresario. Jim was one of those
who brought about the transformation of the party's image for which I was
subsequently given much of the credit.'
Colleagues say he can sometimes be 'prickly' in his determination to get
things right. But he is a popular figure with journalists, who appreciate
his convivial manner and knack of telling original jokes.
After an early career encompassing the BBC, West End theatre and British
Olivetti, he joined Labour as a press officer between the two general
elections of 1974. Then, he recalls, the party's notion of publicity was
'for the head of communications to call a meeting and say: 'We have got a
conference coming up in two weeks and we need a slogan - anyone got any
ideas?'.'
It is easy to forget it was only in 1983 that Labour lavished Pounds 7,500
on its very first conference set.
He identifies a number of significant presentational milestones since then.
First, the 1984 campaign for elections to the European Parliament, which was
the first to employ 'publicity techniques that are now taken for granted'.
Then the conception and design of the now ubiquitous Labour rose.
He also highlights the launch of the 1987 general election manifesto at a
plush conference centre. 'The Tories launched their manifesto in Central
Office on the same day. They looked cramped. We looked stylish. We didn't
look back after that.'
Today, Labour's sets are imbued with a classy, uncluttered quality -
off-white decor, off-centre lectern and copious rose-bowls - which is Mr
Parish's hallmark. His chief aim in this is to focus attention on the
speaker and help to 'clarify' the message.
He expects this general election to be the first fully to exploit satellite
communications, with the result that parties will engage in 'hour-to-hour
combat'.
It will also be a race for the early bird, with Labour's morning press
conferences starting at 7.45am sharp.
'It is about trying to grab the issue of the day,' he explains, dismissing
as 'boy scoutish' the Liberal Democrat move to summon the press at 7.15am.

A SHARP contrast between highly urbanised regions and the rest of the UK
will characterise economic growth in the 1990s, replacing the north-south
divide of the previous decade, according to a report published yesterday.
The report, by the Northern Ireland Economic Research Centre and Oxford
Economic Forecasting, predicted lower employment in the more urban regions
(Greater London, west Midlands and north-west England) in 1995 than in 1990,
with the largest fall in Greater London.
Scotland and Northern Ireland would be the slowest growing regions during
the 1990s, while East Anglia would continue to be the most buoyant.
The report said the northern half of the UK would grow at a broadly similar
rate to the southern regions.
The regions expected to lead in employment growth were the south-east
excluding Greater London, East Anglia, the south-west and the east Midlands,
followed by Wales, Yorkshire and Humberside.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Securities dealer pleads guilty to misuse of funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN AUTHORISED securities dealer misused clients' funds to prop up his
business while pretending to carry out their instructions and issuing them
with false contracts notes, Southwark Crown Court was told yesterday.
Mr Andrew Kimmins admitted two charges of fraudulent trading. They stated
that between November 1986 and December 1988 he was knowingly party to the
carrying on of the businesses of Blade Securities and Blade Investments,
both of Brompton Road, London, with intent to defraud creditors. Another 23
charges were left on the court file. He will be sentenced later.
The two companies have been wound up with combined debts of Pounds 2.9m.
Mr James Curtis, prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office, said Mr Kimmins
had obtained Financial Services Act authorisation for Blade Investments from
the Securities Association and the Association of Futures Brokers and
Dealers by making inaccurate declarations about Blade Investments' capital
and funding. He had omitted the fact that it was assuming substantial debts
of Blade Securities, which was insolvent.
Blade Investments traded for eight months before being served with
preventive orders by the regulatory bodies in December 1988.
Mr Curtis said the prosecution accepted that Mr Kimmins had set up the
business honestly and tried to run it as a genuine business venture. His
business practices had, however, been inappropriate and unprofessional.
By the end of 1986 Blade Securities was being run negligently. From mid
1987, when Mr Kimmins had been aware the position was worsening, he had
become reckless in handling existing company obligations and incurring new
ones.
Mr Curtis said: 'In late 1987, when the position was irretrievable and both
companies insolvent, Kimmins resorted to specific acts of misuse of clients'
money or stockholdings, albeit for the purposes of the business.'
The prosecution accepted this had been done in the hope of rescue. No rescue
had come, though Mr Kimmins maintained that well into 1989 he had treated
the rescue proposal as realistic and been led to believe that others did
also.
He had persisted in commercially unsatisfactory settlement practices, caused
clients' holdings to become depleted and incurred heavy bank debts, Mr
Curtis said.
Instead of using clients' money to buy shares, he had applied it for other
purposes, such as security for trading debts, while maintaining the pretence
of having carried out clients' instructions.
Late in 1988 he carried out a series of acts of fraudulent trading in
relation to a Standard Chartered rights issue.

Public Opinion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR has taken a three-point lead over the Tories in the latest opinion
poll, which shows them with 41 per cent to 38 per cent for the government.
The ICM survey, in today's Daily Mail, also indicates that almost half of
those questioned - including just over a quarter of Labour voters - believe
that the recession would end more quickly if the Budget contains tax cuts.
Labour is due to continue its attack on the government's taxation and
borrowing plans at a press conference today.
More worryingly for the Tories, Mr John Major's popularity fell six points
to 36 per cent, while the rating for Mr Neil Kinnock as a potential prime
minister has risen by three points to 24 per cent.
The Tories have slipped three points since last month's ICM poll, which
showed them on 41 per cent - a one point lead over Labour. It is their
lowest ICM rating since July.
The Liberal Democrats' showing has risen to 17 per cent from 13 in January.
The 48 per cent of those saying they believe economic recovery will come
more quickly with tax cuts compares with about one-third who believe
recovery will begin more quickly through government expenditure.
Tax cuts as a way to help the economy are favoured by seven out of ten Tory
voters, 27 per cent of Labour voters and 41 per cent of Liberal Democrats.
Labour is confident that the lead represents a breaking of the deadlock in
the polls, but the Tories can argue that it is still within the three per
cent margin for error.
ICM interviewed 1,557 people in 54 constituencies last Friday and Saturday.

FT  26 FEB 92 / BAe to join forces in helicopter bid: Race for Pounds 700m
MoD order prompts link with Franco-German group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace has agreed to link up with the Franco-German Eurocopter
consortium to bid for the Ministry of Defence's Pounds 700m contract for
about 100 attack helicopters.
The agreement will pit BAe and the Franco-German group against a rival
partnership between Westland, the UK helicopter manufacturer, and McDonnell
Douglas of the US.
It might also lead to broader co-operation between BAe and Eurocopter and
help BAe expand its defence and aerospace interests in the helicopter
business, in which it has had a limited presence.
Eurocopter is the world's second largest helicopter manufacturer after
Sikorsky of the US. It was formed at the beginning of this year when
Aerospatiale of France merged its helicopter activities with those of
Deutsche Aerospace.
Mr Jean Francois Bigay, the Eurocopter chairman, yesterday said the
agreement with BAe was initially to study how the two companies could put
together a joint bid of Eurocopter's Tiger helicopter for the MoD's
requirement of 100 attack helicopters.
The Tiger, which will be supplied to the French and German armed forces,
will be powered by an engine made by a consortium including Rolls-Royce, MTU
of Germany and Turbomeca of France.
The Tiger would be competing against the McDonnell Douglas Apache
helicopter, which would be produced in co-operation with Westland for the UK
requirement.
The MoD is expected to seek official bids for its attack helicopter
requirement by the middle of next year, with a final decision made late next
year or in 1994.
Eurocopter had earlier sought to join forces with Westland, but the
Yeovil-based company decided instead to team up with McDonnell Douglas.
Eurocopter turned to BAe because it needed a UK partner to stand any chance
of winning the MoD contract.
BAe, in partnership with General Electric Company of the UK, last year bid
unsuccessfully to be prime contractor for the Royal Navy's EH101 Merlin
anti-submarine helicopters. The contract went to a partnership between IBM
of the US and Westland.
In spite of this setback BAe has continued to seek to expand into the
military helicopter business through its defence systems and services
division.
A BAe official indicated yesterday that the agreement with Eurocopter 'could
eventually go beyond the bid for the UK contract'.

companies a possible partnership in its 146 regional jet programme. The
three are Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries.
BAe has been seeking industrial partners for its regional jet programme,
which has suffered from the downturn in civil aviation and the acute
financial difficulties of smaller airlines.
BAe executives confirmed yesterday that the company had talked with several
European and Japanese manufacturers but that it was particularly interested
in an alliance with Japan.
A Japanese partnership would boost BAe's presence in the Asia-Pacific civil
aircraft market, which is expected to grow strongly in the next 10 years.
The Japanese companies are interested in a partnership venture with an
established western aerospace manufacturer which would give them access to
the development of a commercial aircraft programme rather than just
sub-contracting work.
Mitsubishi has discussed co-operation in the regional aircraft sector with
Deutsche Aerospace. These talks are understood not to have progressed.
BAe has offered the Japanese manufacturers an opportunity to join its 146
programme, including development of a 100-seat regional airliner.
The European Airbus consortium, in which BAe has a 20 per cent stake, has
also held preliminary talks with the big three Japanese companies. This was
to discuss a possible partnership in the development of a very large Airbus
aircraft programme, involving a 600-seater jumbo airliner towards the end of
the decade.
The Japanese companies have so far been tied to the US Boeing company, the
world's largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft, but their role in
Boeing programmes has involved only sub-contracting work.
BAe and Airbus would offer the Japanese an opportunity to share in the
development of commercial aircraft programmes, something Boeing has been
reluctant to do.
BAe has been seeking a partnership to rationalise its loss-making 146
business as part of its overall restructuring strategy. The UK group has
called for a rationalisation of the regional aircraft industry, where
competition has become intense because of the large number of rival aircraft
programmes.
BAe's link with the Japanese Honda car group in its Rover car subsidiary has
helped increase the UK company's visibility in the Japanese market.
The Japanese companies have also shown interest in BAe's profitable jet
business involving the 125 corporate aircraft family. BAe has made it clear,
however, that it is not considering selling this concern at this stage.

FT  26 FEB 92 / MPs back break-up of rivers authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS for the break-up of the National Rivers Authority, the watchdog on
river pollution, were backed by the influential Commons environment
committee yesterday.
Splitting the NRA, which has existed only two years, is one option being
considered by the government in its moves to form a powerful national agency
embracing most aspects of environmental protection. The NRA wants to keep
its organisation intact and believes that if necessary it should be absorbed
into the new agency as a whole.
The cross-party committee, which has been examining the government's
proposals, believes the NRA's responsibility for pollution control should be
taken away and given to the new body. Sir Hugh Rossi, the committee
chairman, said this would result in a 'lean, mean organisation responsible
for environmental protection'.
The size of the NRA staff is expected to rise to 8,000 this year. The
committee estimates that if pollution control were taken from the NRA it
would be deprived of 14 per cent of its budget and 19 per cent of its staff.
The Conservatives, if returned to power, intend to introduce legislation in
the autumn establishing the new national agency. In addition to all or part
of the NRA, it would incorporate the Pollution Inspectorate.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: White paper on health set for delay
 -News in Brief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLICATION of the planned white paper on preventive health care is to be
delayed until after the election, in an embarrassing setback for the
government, Alison Smith writes.
The emphasis on preventive care was intended to form part of the Tories'
counter-attack to Labour's onslaught over the national health service.
The Treasury, however, is said to have argued that the implications of the
proposals meant that they could not be launched before the Budget.
Ministers were then advised that there would not then be enough time to
publish them as government policy before running into the election campaign,
if - as expected - it begins in mid-March.
The green paper on a 10-year plan to make the UK healthier was published
last June and the consultation period finished at the end of October.
*****
EDUCATION: Labour will abolish England's remaining grammar schools and end
all selection at 11 if it wins the election, Mr Jack Straw, shadow education
secretary, said yesterday.
Mr Straw said grammar and secondary modern schools would be integrated into
'full fledged comprehensive schools.'
He attacked the government's readiness to increase the number of grammar
schools by allowing schools which have opted out of local authority control
to change their status.
*****
CANDIDATES: Labour yesterday selected candidates to fight Liverpool Broad
Green and Coventry South East at the general election in place of MPs Mr
Terry Fields and Mr Dave Nellist, expelled in December for alleged links
with Militant.
Ms Jane Kennedy, a 33-year-old union official, will defend the Liverpool
seat where Mr Fields had a 6,047 majority in 1987. Mr Jim Cunningham will
defend Mr Nellist's 6,653 majority. The expelled MPs have said they will
contest the seats.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Baker initiative on bail offences
attacked - Law and Order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT measures aimed at cracking down on 'bail bandits' who re-offend
before coming to trial met charges of blatant electioneering from opposition
parties yesterday.
Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, argued that a considerable toughening of
the law was necessary to deal with 'the hard core who persistently
re-offend'. Last year some 50,000 out of half a million people granted bail
were convicted of offences while on remand, up from 35,000 five years ago,
he said.
He went on to outline legislation to make offending when on bail a factor to
be taken into account by courts when sentencing, improved means for
identifying likely re-offenders and an Pounds 8m grant to increase the
number of bail hostels.
The timing of the initiative met with scorn from Labour and the Liberal
Democrats. While formally welcoming several of the measures, they said that
a doubling of the crime rate to more than 5m cases a year since 1979 had
demolished the Conservatives' case to be the natural party of law and order.
Mr Baker's Commons statement of the crackdown on bail offenders was widely
seen in Westminster as a bid to upstage Labour's attempt to take the
initiative as the Liberal Democrats also levelled charges of government
complacency.
The rising tide of crime now frequently ranks in the top five issues of
greatest concern to voters, according to opinion polls. Politicians are also
aware that definitive crime figures are due to be published towards the end
of March, when an election campaign is thought almost certain to be under
way.
Leaks have suggested that these could show a 20 per cent rise in crime in
the past year alone - a potentially highly damaging blow to the Tories.
Labour officials said yesterday that private polling has shown they now lead
the Tories by 40 points to 34 when voters are asked which party would be
good or excellent at tackling crime.
Yesterday Mr Hattersley said a Labour government would meet demands from
chief constables for an increase of up to 3,000 in police strength.
Economies within the Home Office, including reducing numbers of remand
prisoners held in police stations, could finance the increase, he claimed.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Blunkett warns of 'shambles' -
Local Government Reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'PIECEMEAL' approach proposed by ministers for re-organising local
government would lead to shambles and a period of blight, Mr David Blunkett,
the opposition local government spokesman, warned yesterday.
Speaking during the final Commons stages of the legislation that sets up a
commission to review local government, Mr Blunkett said an incoming Labour
government would ensure that the review covered the country as a whole
comprehensively, and produced plans - ideally within two years - followed by
a period of consultation.
In this way, he said, people 'would be able to see the pattern of local
government emerging across the country'.
There would then be a single vesting day to avoid a time when staff left
councils which were to be abolished and services began to disintegrate, but
new authorities were not yet in place.
The government's ideologically driven approach, he said, meant that it had
missed the opportunity of consensus and lasting change.
Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, accused Labour of
manufacturing disagreement with the government, and described the bill as
'unusually enlightened'.
He condemned Labour's commitment to a system of unitary authorities rather
than allowing some two-tier local government, describing it as 'devised in
Whitehall, imposed on local people, all at one go in one big bang,
standardised and socialist'.
Responding to pressure from Tory backbenchers, Mr Portillo said the
government would look again at the guidance to the commission.
This should ensure that it reflected the differences between people's
expectations of the localities which should meet their needs and the areas
through which services could be provided efficiently.

FT  26 FEB 92 / The Mood of Britain: Shhh . . . Margaret Roberts slept here
 -From Grantham to Willoughby's farm, Lincolnshire businesses are
questioning rampant entrepreneurialism / Michael Cassell moves on to
Lincolnshire in his pre-election trip around the country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAUL NESBITT doesn't shout about it, but he can arrange for people to sleep
in Mrs Thatcher's bedroom for Pounds 19 a night. 'Some are delighted but
others might be horrified at the prospect. You have to play it carefully,'
he stresses.
Nesbitt owns the corner property at the junction of North Parade and Broad
Street in Grantham, home for Margaret Hilda Roberts during the first,
formative years of her life. He runs the Premier restaurant from the former
grocery shop and offers bed and breakfast above.
He says: 'The Thatcher connection, like the woman herself I suppose, has
been a bit of a mixed blessing. As far as I am concerned, a Tory Pounds 5
note is as good as a Labour Pounds 5 note but some people certainly stayed
away because of her. We've been busier since she lost the job.'
The business community as a whole might share Nesbitt's mixed feelings after
a period in which entrepreneurialism was given its head, only to be reined
back by all the old, familiar problems of recession.
Even so, with 50,000 businesses failing last year, the Tories cling to their
mantle of the party of business. Their corporate supporters may feel badly
let down but many will still find it hard to endorse a Labour party bloated
on prawns in its search for acceptability.
The chatty proprietor of the Premier is not particularly impressed with the
Conservative record as the party of small business. 'They are meant to be on
our side but they have taken decisions which hardly suggest they understand
the pressures we face.' he says.
Paul Hodgkinson, a Lincolnshire businessman on a grander scale, is much more
complimentary. His private property and construction group - chosen by the
Duke and Duchess of York to build their royal ranch-house in Windsor Great
Park - has grown by more than 10 times in as many years.
But he continues to resist the temptation to float Simons Group, his Pounds
120m-turnover business. 'Too many middle-sized companies were lured during
the 1980s into getting a 'get-rich-quick' quote and have been forced to doff
their cap to their share price and to short-termism.'
Such businesses, he suggests, provide the bedrock of economic success in
countries like Japan and Germany but too many in Britain were swallowed up
during a period of 'free-market euphoria'. But as he looks from his window
towards Lincoln cathedral, a medieval monument to an earlier age of
enterprise and wealth, he praises 1980s progress in 'freeing up the entire
thought process which permits business to succeed.
'We were a risk-averse nation but a new generation has been taught to go for
it. Companies will always go bust in a capitalist system but there should be
no stigma attached to it. People should be encouraged to pick themselves up
and start all over again.'
He suggests that, even now, insufficient numbers of people understand that
wealth creation is the principal plank on which everything else depends.
Derek Lee, headmaster of King's School, Grantham - where the young Isaac
Newton carved his name on the windowsill - considers a good education
equally important.
Lee has recently emerged, like Lincolnshire itself, as something of a
pioneer in the changing world of education.
In 1989 his school was one of the first in the country to achieve
grant-maintained status. The first primary and secondary schools to opt out
of local authority control were in the county.
According to Lee there was some initial apprehension among the parents at
the decision, but few subsequent regrets. 'Within eight months of winning
our new status we doubled the funds going directly into the classroom,' he
says.
The decision has given the school a highly prized freedom of action. 'It
must make sense for us to decide our own priorities and allocate resources
accordingly.' Lee expects many others in the publicly funded sector to take
advantage of the sort of freedoms previously reserved for the realms of
private education.
Many teachers on the front line, however, are quick to criticise the drive
to spread grant-maintained status as an irrelevant diversion from the real
challenges facing education.
In the windswept hamlet of Wasps' Nest, to the north of Grantham, Cathy
Ward, a former primary school teacher who now runs adult education classes,
says opting out is 'just another example of the two-tier approach to the
provision of essential public services'.
The change, she says, may well hand greater discretion over spending to
good, middle-class schools but the real issue is the level of resources
itself. 'It's fashionable to say you can't solve problems by throwing money
at them. It would be nice, just once, to give it a try. Let's have less talk
about a revolution in education and more textbooks in the classroom.'
All around in tiny pockets of habitation such as Sotts Hole and Stixwould
another revolution is under way. Striking east across Nocton Fen towards the
'calm and deep peace' of Tennyson's Lincolnshire Wolds, or south-east over
ancient marshlands which once hid Hereward the Wake, lie some of Britain's
richest soils. In such parts 40 well-farmed acres would once provide a good
living for a hard-working family. Not any more, it seems, with real incomes
here and throughout the farming community judged to have fallen to their
lowest in the post-war period.
In one of the most efficient agricultural areas in Europe the notion of
family farming appears to be under threat. Old dynasties have been replaced
by remote, institutional owners employing extensive farming methods across
expanding agricultural empires.
Richard Willoughby, who farms more than 400 acres near Alford, under the
gentle slopes of the Wolds and a few miles from 'bracing' Skegness, is not
an institutional squire. He knows the jokes about Volvo-driving farmers
pleading poverty but says there is real cause for complaint.
He bought his farm with his brother in the mid-1980s but says he would have
been better off remaining as a tenant, given production surpluses, falling
crop prices and escalating interest rates.
He accepts the farm is looking a bit run down and he cannot replace
machinery. Some of his neighbours are packing it in. 'There are more rules
and regulations every year and now farmers are encouraged to let good,
productive acreage lie idle. It's madness. I won't be encouraging my two
sons to follow me into such madness,' he says.
Nigel Lindsay, director of the Community Council of Lincolnshire, a
voluntarily funded organisation which aims to keep alive community life,
says some farmers are pinning hopes of financial salvation on building
houses or golf courses. Village life, he believes, is increasingly under
strain, with jobs on the land disappearing and retiring newcomers dislodging
the locals. badly in the wake of bus deregulation and rail services have
deteriorated. Some places are now effectively cut off,' he says. It is a
claim denied by the county council.
Naome Cottrell, a nursing home worker, is waiting in Sleaford, a neat market
town on the western edge of the fens, for a lift back to Boston, the
700-year-old seaport on The Wash where the docks are now promised a
brighter, privatised future.
She says: 'They say it should bring more jobs into town but it won't make up
for those lost. Anyhow, getting there without a car is bad news. If we are
all so much better off, why do we have to wait longer for everything from
buses to hospital beds? Answer me that.'
The last two articles in Michael Cassell's series will appear later this
week.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Report warns of pressures on charitable trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING CONCERN about pressures facing Britain's charitable sector is shown
in research published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation yesterday.
The report said grant-making charitable trusts - which distribute about
Pounds 650m a year - faced increased demands for funding which might
previously have come from the state.
This, combined with changes in the definition of the proper boundaries of
statutory responsibilities, had led trusts to 'question the relevance and
adequacy of defining their role in terms of doing what the state does not'.
It said the lack of certainty that statutory authorities would provide
continuing funds for projects had led grant-making trusts to question the
wisdom of their traditional roles of pump-priming and encouraging
innovation.
The report listed a range of government policies and related developments
which it said were affecting grant-making trusts. These included forthcoming
changes in the care of the elderly and handicapped in the community;
withdrawal of social security benefits from most of those aged 16 and 17;
the sale of council houses; the introduction of local management of schools;
contracting in the National Health Service; the removal of restrictions on
hospital fund-raising and the shortage of new money for medical research.
The report said trusts would have to redefine their role in a new mixed
economy and examine relationships with the statutory, voluntary and private
sectors.
The managerial consequences of the community care reforms which come into
full effect next year have not been fully understood in local and health
authorities, the Audit Commission said in a report today.
It said any one of the package of changes, aimed at caring for people in the
community rather than in institutions, would 'tax the ingenuity of most
managers'. Taken together, the proposed changes presented a daunting
challenge. There would have to be heavy emphasis on agencies working
together and a considerable investment in training at all levels.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL must be broken up before privatisation if the government is to
avoid the mistakes made in previous flotations, Professor Colin Robinson of
Surrey University said at a conference in London yesterday.
Prof Robinson contradicted a claim by Mr Cecil Parkinson, a former energy
secretary, at the same conference that privatisation had liberalised the
electricity industry.
'There is almost as much government intervention as in the old days,' he
said. National Power and PowerGen, the two privatised generators, were
supposed to be commercial companies but had so much market share that Offer,
the electricity industry watchdog, was having to regulate them closely.
He said the government should aim to create genuine competition in the
domestic coal and electricity industries by breaking up British Coal and by
dismantling National Power and PowerGen.

International Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of the upheavals in the financial services sector during the past
few years, there is no possibility of pushing back the pendulum to where it
was before financial markets were deregulated, Mr Brian Quinn, executive
director of the Bank of England, said yesterday.
Speaking at a Financial Times conference on International Banking in London,
Mr Quinn defended the deregulation of financial services markets in the
1980s. 'It is very clear to me that the users of banking and financial
services have derived very considerable benefits from the liberalisation of
market,' he said.
He warned about the growing costs of maintaining an orderly banking system.
'Banking systems have been stretched to a degree not seen for many years,
and in some countries substantial public financial resources have had to be
devoted to propping up the system.'
Mr Quinn revealed that the Bank and other banking supervisors in the Basle
Committee were examining the criteria for bank authorisation and
communication in the light of recent developments, including the possibility
of requiring banking groups with complex structures to have greater
transparency in their operations.
However, in reply to a question about Bank of Credit and Commerce, Mr Quinn
said he felt it was important not to overreact to the episode.
'BCCI was a unique organisation in my experience. I have never seen anything
like it before or since,' he said.
Mr Quinn appeared to pour cold water on some large building societies' hopes
that they may soon be regulated in the same way as banks.

FT  26 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Apex Trust terms are accepted by
creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Apex Trust, the charity that provides training for
ex-offenders, seemed more assured yesterday after creditors, including the
Department of Employment, accepted terms from court-appointed
administrators.
Apex Trust has been fighting voluntary liquidation since January because of
cashflow shortfalls - after the setting up of Training and Enterprise
Councils (Tecs), which pay training providers in arrears - and muddles over
government payments.
The latter included a demand by the Department of Employment in January for
repayment of Pounds 250,000 which it said it had paid to Apex last year.
The department yesterday effectively wrote off the Pounds 250,000 when it
and other unsecured creditors agreed to terms put to them by Cork Gully, the
joint administrator. Unsecured creditors were owed Pounds 1.5m.
Preferential creditors, including the Inland Revenue and Apex employees,
agreed to accept payments due to them, amounting to about Pounds 300,000, in
four equal instalments starting in April.
The administration period will now extend to the end of March while the
administrators continue to negotiate the necessary funding from the Home
Office and the private sector. Cork Gully declined to say how much was
needed.
The charity had an overdraft of about Pounds 50,000 at the time of the
government demand.
Cork Gully said there was a 'reasonable chance' of Apex surviving. It did
not have money in hand to cover preferential creditors but had a number of
firm pledges of money.

BRITISH GAS yesterday received official permission from the Department of

Sychrava writes.
The field is about 25 miles off the Lancashire coast close to the larger
South Morecambe field. It will produce at a rate of 588m cu ft a day, or
about 5 per cent of UK gas consumption, and is expected to start output in
October 1994.
British Gas has already started work on a new Pounds 295m terminal to handle
the gas, next to its existing terminal at Barrow-in-Furness. The total value
of the project is estimated at just more than Pounds 500m.

FT  26 FEB 92 / A strong defence case for the status quo: Lord Lane's
resignation and the views of his successor, Sir Peter Taylor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Lord Chancellor's department was quick yesterday to play down any
suggestion that Lord Lane's resignation as Lord Chief Justice, 18 months
short of the compulsory retirement age of 75, had anything to do with the
controversy which dogged the last four years of his term in office.
Much of that controversy sprang from his handling of the first appeal by the
Birmingham Six and his pronouncement in January 1988, after a 27-day appeal
hearing, that 'the longer this hearing has gone on, the more convinced this
court has become that the verdict of the jury was correct'. These words
returned to haunt him when the convictions of the Birmingham Six were
finally overturned three years later.
His refusal to apologise to the men or to acknowledge the part the courts
played in keeping them in prison for 16 years for a crime they did not
commit led to calls for his resignation and was widely seen as a major
contributory factor in the loss of public confidence in the criminal justice
system and the judiciary.
Many in the legal profession said that while he had let it be known some
time before that he did not want to carry on until 75, the criticism of his
role in the Birmingham Six case had simply stiffened his resolve to stay.
Now, after the passage of a sufficient period for the two events not to be
inextricably linked in the public's eyes, he has decided to step down.
Frequently portrayed as a reactionary who was fiercely opposed to reform of
the legal profession, Lord Lane was not always so controversial.
At times during his 12 years in office he showed he could be both
progressive and humane in his approach to the development of the law. At the
same time as the Birmingham Six were being released, Lord Lane was in
another court putting to rest the legal fiction that a man cannot rape his
wife.
When he took over from Lord Widgery in 1980 sentencing policy was in a mess
which he is widely credited with having corrected. He introduced sentencing
guidelines for Crown Court judges and, although tough on sex offences and
violent crime, he was strongly in favour of non-custodial sentences for
minor offences.
Sir Peter Taylor, his successor, comes to the job with all the apparent
'liberal' credentials necessary to oversee a difficult period of change in
the criminal justice system.
At a press conference yesterday, however, he mounted a strong defence of the
status quo. Having said that it was too soon for him to make any statements
of intent or pronouncements of policy he proceeded to rule out the need for
any change in the training, working practices or appointment of judges, or
the need for there to be more women and members of the ethnic minorities on
the bench.
He said he was not concerned that newly appointed judges were untrained or
unqualified to do their job. No doubt as time went on there would be more
women and ethnic minority judges, but he did not want 'a proportionally
representative judiciary'.
On sentencing, Sir Peter said the guidelines would be revised from time to
time but 'right now' he could not think of any he wanted to change.
He was opposed to television cameras in the court room. The US experience
proved that only the more sensational trials would be televised. He had no
immediate plans for any change in the role of the Lord Chief Justice, he
said.
Sir Peter said, however, that he shared the public's anxiety about the
recent spate of miscarriages of justice and the length and cost of complex
fraud trials. He acknowledged there was a need to restore public confidence
in the system. To that end he would encourage greater openness by, and
access to, the judi-ciary.
Judges would need to be more vigilant to avoid miscarriages of justice in
the future, but he warned that no system which involved humans could be
infallible.
Sir Peter said he would be reluctant to see the jury abolished in complex
fraud trials but acknowledged that it was one of the options under
consideration. He was opposed to the US system of plea bargaining in fraud
cases although he thought it might be possible to make fraud trials more
manageable by persuading prosecuting authorities to target their case on a
smaller number of charges.
He hoped a great many of these issues would be sorted out by the Royal
Commission on Criminal Justice, which is due to report in the middle of next
year.

FT  26 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Union threat over leaked Ford
relocation proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION leaders at Ford UK yesterday promised 'a major reaction' if the
company goes ahead with a plan to slim down two research and development
centres at Dunton and Aveley in Essex and concentrate R&amp;D work in Germany.
A document leaked to the AEU engineering union talks of shrinking Dunton,
Ford's biggest R&amp;D centre in Europe, and Aveley, as an 'option' which 'does
not represent company policy'.
If the plan did go ahead it would mean transferring to Germany about 1,200
of the 4,000 jobs at the two centres. The AEU believes that it could quickly
lead to the closure of all R&amp;D facilities in the UK and the loss of 12,000
jobs.
Union officials are convinced that even if the company shelves the option
under discussion it will want to shift more R&amp;D work to Germany.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, the AEU's senior Ford official, said: 'Dunton and Aveley
provide core services for Ford. If they are removed, the writing is on the
wall for Ford as a major manufacturer in Britain.'
Ford said the document was part of 'an ongoing study into engineering
activities in Europe'.
The company denied any immediate plans for a major job transfer to Germany,
but pointed out that other big car manufacturers have only one important R&amp;D
centre in Europe.
Merkenich, near Cologne, where most of the Dunton jobs would go, is almost
the same size as Dunton.
Mr Lindsey Halstead, Ford of Europe chairman, recently denied that Dunton
would be closed, pointing out that the company had just invested Pounds 156m
there.

FT  26 FEB 92 / M6 to be widened after plan for private toll rival scrapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has abandoned plans for a privately financed toll motorway
between Manchester and Birmingham. Instead it proposes to widen the existing
M6 motorway from three lanes to four in each direction.
The Transport Department said last night that the decision was taken 'for a
variety of reasons, ranging from environmental to operational'.
The turnaround was criticised by Mr John Prescott, shadow transport
secretary, who said the government's ideological commitment to privately
financed roadbuilding had caused delays to essential road schemes.
Mr Prescott said companies which had been asked to submit preliminary bids
for the motorway 'must now be sceptical about other private road-building
plans'.
The British Road Federation said the revised proposals would not solve the
need for extra motorway capacity between Manchester and Birmingham. If a
private road was not to be built, a public-sector motorway should be
provided in its place. The federation said that, at the very least, the M6
should be widened to five lanes in each direction.
The Transport Department estimated that the extra lanes for the M6 between
junctions 11 and 20 would cost Pounds 450m. The department hoped that the
work will start in 1996 and last two to four years. The road would be
widened by building another two lanes on one side of the existing motorway.
The private road plan attracted four bids last year. Members of the groups
included Balfour Beatty, Tarmac and Trafalgar House from the UK; Italstat,
the Italian toll road operator; Cofiroute, the French toll road operator;
and French contractors GTM International and SOGEA.
The Transport Department yesterday announced that it would seek bids to
build a privately financed motorway to the west of Birmingham. The road
would link with the northern relief road, which is also to be privately
financed, and create an orbital, mostly tolled, road around the city.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Paternoster Square application called in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, environment secretary, yesterday took charge of the
planning application for Paternoster Square, putting another twist into one
of the most controversial planning debates in London.
His decision to call in the application is likely to mean the end of the
neo-classical proposals put forward by Paternoster Associates to replace the
post-war office blocks on the site north of St Paul's Cathedral.
Mr Heseltine's intervention may be controversial in that the proposals were
warmly received by the public. Many critics felt, however, the scheme was
excessively bulky. In December the Corporation of London's planning
committee sent the scheme back to the developers with 22 objections.
Nuclear Electric's application to redevelop Sudbury House, adjacent to the
square, has also been called in by Mr Heseltine.
Mr Heseltine has called on the landowners and the corporation to prepare a
master plan to guide development. 'In my view it is essential that this area
is developed in a coherent way and to the highest possible standards, given
the national importance of the site.'
He added that he would consider the called-in planning applications on their
merits. 'However, they will be judged against the high standards I consider
to be appropriate for this site and the need for the area to be developed
coherently.'

FT  26 FEB 92 / Lords reject TSW appeal on franchise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Independent Television Commission yesterday beat off the last remaining
threat to the ITV franchising process as Television South West lost its
appeal in the Lords.
TSW went to the Law Lords to try to overturn the majority decision of the
Court of Appeal that the commission had not been unfair in rejecting its
Pounds 16.11m bid.
Lord Keith announced the Law Lords' verdict yesterday after a 10-minute
recess at the end of a five-day hearing. The reasons for the decision will
be given in the next few weeks.
Mr Harry Turner, TSW managing director, said: 'It's a tough day but life has
to go on.' He said his priority now was to place as many of his staff as
possible with Westcountry Television, the company that won the franchise
with a bid of Pounds 7.8m.
The Law Lords' decision effectively ends the prospect that the commission's
decisions will be legally challenged by other aggrieved losers.
TV South, which lost its franchise to Meridian Broadcasting, had been
considering going to the European Court if TSW had won its case.
The delay will, however, pose problems for Westcountry, whose main
shareholders include Associated Newspapers, South West Water and Brittany
Ferries.
Because of the litigation the company has not been awarded its licence and
was unable to sign contracts for the building of studios.
One option is to take over TSW and get a Stock Exchange quotation and
operating studios at the same time. Westcountry would not, however, be
interested at yesterday's price of 46p, which values the company at about
Pounds 10m.
If the price of TSW remains at levels that Westcountry considers
unreasonably high the company will simply proceed as quickly as it can.
It is unlikely that Westcountry will be able to offer the full planned
service when it takes over on January 1 next year.
Mr George Russell, commission chairman, said he hoped that 'in the interests
of the viewers in the south-west they (Westcountry) and TSW can work towards
an orderly handover'.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Murray Johnstone slashes entry charge for unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MURRAY JOHNSTONE, the Glasgow-based fund management group, is cutting the
initial charge on its unit trusts from about 5 per cent to 1 per cent in a
move which could spark competition in the retail investment industry,
Phillip Coggan writes.
The unitholder pays the initial charge as part of a spread between the offer
price (at which the investor buys) and the bid price (at which the investor
sells). The greater the spread, the more the fund will have to rise in value
before the investor makes a profit.
By cutting the initial charge the spreads on Murray Johnstone's funds will
average about 2.6 per cent, compared with an average of about 6 per cent for
the sector. In other words, investors backing these funds will have a 'head
start' of more than 3 per cent.
Murray Johnstone is raising its annual charge from 1 per cent to 1.5 per
cent. But this higher level is not unusual.
In the US many mutual funds (the equivalent of unit trusts) have small or
non-existent initial charges. These 'no-load funds' have cornered a big
share of the market.
The problem in establishing such funds in the UK has been distribution. Most
unit trusts are sold through independent financial advisers, who receive a 3
per cent commission which is deducted from the initial charge.
Although Murray Johnstone is offering a renewal commission of 0.5 per cent
to advisers who keep their clients in the trusts for a year, the group may
find they will lack sufficient incentive to recommend its trusts. Murray may
have to rely on direct telephone sales or on fee-charging advisers.
In the last financial year unit trusts have been hard-pushed to compete with
investment trusts, their publicly quoted rivals, and this move may be a sign
of competitive pressures in the industry.
Mr Graeme Farquharson, investment director of Hill Martin, the financial
adviser group, said: 'It is an interesting move and I would not be surprised
if it doesn't prompt other unit trust managers to do it.'

FT  26 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Employment Department to cut 800 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT department charged with the task of getting more people into
jobs is to cut about 800 of its own posts, it was announced yesterday.
The posts in the Training, Enterprise and Education Directorate (Teed), part
of the Department of Employment, will be lost after July following a review.
Five hundred of the jobs will be shed in Teed's nine regional offices, which
administer the Training and Enterprise Councils, and about 300 will go at
the central directorate in Sheffield.
Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said yesterday there was 'every
likelihood' that the cut would be achieved through voluntary measures.
He admitted the figures were significant but said it included 150 personnel
jobs being transferred from the regions to the Employment Service, which is
responsible for initiatives including JobClubs.
The Civil and Public Services Union, which with the NUCPS represents the
majority of civil servants, said it was appalled at the job cuts.
Mr Geoff Lewtas, the union's employment service officer, said: 'They are
particularly bad coming at a time of extremely high unemployment. It bodes
ill for the department's work in ensuring that Tecs succeed and are properly
controlled.'
The Department of Employment is one of the government's biggest departments,
with 57,000 employees. The directorate employs about 4,500 people.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said yesterday he had written to
Mr Howard demanding assurances that the job cuts would not affect training.
The Union of Communication Workers, the main postal union, is set to survive
after delegates at a special conference yesterday cleared the way for vital
structural and strategic reforms.
Delegates voted by more than 2-1 not to reject a new industrial agreement
being demanded by Royal Mail. The conference will consider amendments for
the next three days. Rejection of the agreement could mean financial
collapse for the union.

FT  26 FEB 92 / GEC breakthrough improves prospects for superconductors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK RESEARCHERS have developed a 'high-temperature' superconductor which may
be suitable for large-scale applications such as cables carrying electricity
for hundreds of miles without losing energy.
The discovery at General Electric Company's Hirst Research Centre in
Wembley, north-west London, followed a two-year search using a robot which
made and tested materials with 15,000 different chemical compositions. The
work was part of a collaborative project involving six European companies
under the European Community's Brite-Euram programme.
The original excitement about high-temperature superconductors - ceramic
materials first made in 1986 which lose all electrical resistance at the
temperature of liquid nitrogen ( - 196 deg C) - waned as scientists learnt
more about their disadvantages. Most serious is that they cannot carry the
large currents required for power engineering or to make magnets powerful
enough to lift trains.
They are called 'high temperature' because previously superconductivity was
known only at temperatures close to absolute zero ( - 273 deg C).
GEC says its new material promises to be 'superior to the known
high-temperature superconductors in important respects, especially for
high-current applications'.
Details of the compound, which includes seven chemical elements including
cadmium, lead and copper, will be published later this week in
Superconductor Science and Technology, a specialist journal. The compound
resembles the best superconductors discovered so far, the thallium series,
but without their drawbacks of toxicity and volatility.
Only a few grammes have been made but scientists have established that it is
a stable and reproducible material which becomes superconducting at - 181
deg C.
The next step will be for GEC to transfer the material to the other
participants in the EC project: BICC, ABB, Alcatel Cable, Pirelli Cavi and
Siemens. They will work to develop superconducting cables from it, though
these are unlikely to reach the market for 10 years.
According to an EC estimate, Europe could theoretically save Pounds 2bn a
year on energy losses by replacing its power-transmission system with
superconducting cables cooled by liquid nitrogen.
Another large-scale application is energy storage - electricity can flow
indefinitely around a superconducting coil.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING conservative US senator has called for the resignation of Mr
Nicholas Brady, the Treasury secretary, in a sign of the widening rift in
the Republican party over the Bush administration's economic policy.
Senator Connie Mack of Florida said his constituents, like the voters of New
Hampshire in last week's presidential primary, were suffering as a result of
the recession, and that new leadership was needed.
In a letter to President George Bush, Senator Mack wrote: 'You have been
given bad advice on the economy. It's worse than you have been told. That
fault rests on the shoulders of your economic advisers and the head of that
team is Secretary Brady.
'Mr President, the time has come to ask for Secretary Brady's resignation.'
While much of the conservatives' anger among Republicans in Congress has
been targeted at Mr Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and
Budget, the Treasury has also come in for criticism for its reluctance to
take drastic action to stimulate the economy.
Florida's economy has been hard hit in the current recession, and its
unemployment rate of 8.7 per cent is one of the highest in the US. Although
Senator Mack began his career as a Democrat, he is reckoned to be on the
right wing of the Republican party on economic policy.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Canada to cut taxes and public spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OTTAWA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Canadian government yesterday proposed corporate and personal tax cuts
in a budget aimed at boosting public confidence ahead of the general
election expected to be called by mid-1993.
Saying that he was 'reducing spending in order to cut taxes', Mr Donald
Mazankowski, finance minister, also announced the abolition or streamlining
of 46 public-sector agencies and the complete withdrawal of Canadian combat
troops from Europe over the next three years.
Other measures include a cut from 10 per cent to 5 per cent in the
withholding tax on dividends paid to foreigners, and a radical overhaul of
the system of family allowances which have been part of the Canadian social
security net since 1945.
Mr Mazankowski projected a budget deficit of CDollars 27.5bn (Pounds 13.3bn)
in the year to March 31 1993, down from CDollars 31.4bn. The decline is
largely due to lower interest rates on debt servicing.
Next year's deficit will be well above earlier projections of a CDollars
24bn shortfall, and the government has pushed back its target of eliminating
borrowing requirements by one year, to 1995/96.
According to background documents published by the Finance Department,
Ottawa's deficit will be 4 per cent of GDP this year, compared with 6.8 per
cent in the US. Those positions were roughly reversed as recently as 1985.
The tax rate on manufacturing and processing will drop from 23 per cent to
22 per cent next January, and to 21 per cent in 1994. Capital cost
allowances for manufacturing and processing machinery go up immediately from
25 per cent to 30 per cent.
The surtax on personal taxes will fall from 5 per cent to 4 per cent of
basic tax on July 1 and to 3 per cent next January. In a nod to the
hard-pressed construction and real estate industry, Mr Mazankowski will
temporarily allow a portion of tax-sheltered retirement savings to be used
for buying or building a home.
The budget estimates are based on real GDP growth of 2.7 per cent this year
and 4.5 per cent in 1993. Inflation is expected to remain at 2.2 per cent
this year and next, while interest rates are forecast to continue dropping
for at least the next two years.
Mr Mazankowski expects the tax cuts to be entirely offset this year by
spending restraint, further privatisations and steps to improve tax
compliance. But the measures proposed yesterday will have a net stimulatory
impact of CDollars 730m in 1993/94.
Candidates for privatisation include the Royal Canadian Mint. Ottawa also
plans to abolish the Economic Council of Canada, which is one of the
country's leading economic think-tanks. Cabinet ministers are taking a 5 per
cent pay cut, and members of parliament and senior civil servants will no
longer be allowed to travel first-class.

BRAZIL's initial proposal for the rescheduling of its Dollars 21bn-Dollars
22bn debt with the Paris Club group of creditor governments has been
rejected in the first day of negotiations in Paris, writes Christina Lamb in
Rio de Janeiro. However, Brazilian economy ministry officials yesterday
remained confident that agreement would be reached this week.
The Brazilian negotiating team, led by Mr Francisco Gros, the central bank
governor, was working on a new proposal yesterday after German and Japanese
representatives had refused to accept Brazil's original offer.
The main sticking point is Brazil's insistence on including in the
rescheduling, debt that was rescheduled in the last accord in 1988. Mr Gros
said on Friday that this accord had created an excessive concentration of
repayments over the next two years.
Brazil's original proposal asked for the rescheduling of Dollars 13.5bn over
18 years. This includes Dollars 8.6bn in arrears and Dollars 4.9bn in
payments due over the next two years as a result of the 1988 accord.

FT  26 FEB 92 / US aid budget comes under scrutiny: Israeli loans guarantee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE fate of the US foreign aid budget has become inextricably tied up with
that of Israel's request for Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) of loan guarantees
to help it absorb around 1m new immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
Authorisation for US foreign aid is due to expire at the end of March, but
Senator Patrick Leahy, who chairs the Senate sub-committee overseeing
foreign aid funding, says he will not put forward a new aid bill unless an
agreement could be reached that ties the Israeli loan guarantees to some
sort of freeze on Israeli settlements in the Arab territories it occupied in
the 1967 war.
'If we do not have a solution to the guarantees and settlements issue, then
we don't have a bill - it's as simple as that,' he said yesterday.
When it has fallen out with the US administration in the past, Israel has
often been able to call on support in the Congress to make its views
prevail. Today, locked in an apparently irreconcilable dispute with the
administration, it faces an uphill struggle.
Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, told Congress on Monday he would
accept Dollars 2bn a year of loan guarantees for the five years only if
Israel halted settlement activity, or agreed to deduct from the guarantees
the amount it spent in the occupied terri-tories.
Even Israel's strongest supporters, meanwhile, are not eager to force the
issue. They believe they would probably lose a straight majority vote, and
would certainly be unable to muster enough support to override a
presidential veto.
'It's given that any sort of guarantee arrangement, in order to be sellable
here, would have to be tied to pretty substantive restrictions on
settlements,' said one congressional aide yesterday.
The debate is taking place at a time when there is little enthusiasm either
among congressmen or in the US at large for foreign aid in general.
At the same time, Israel's position in the US public opinion has weakened in
recent years. The Palestinian uprising and Israeli tactics against it have
contributed substantially to this.
A central factor, however, has been President George Bush's public stand
against Israel, particularly in the September press conference when he
called for a four month delay on the loan guarantees and depicted himself as
standing alone against hordes of Israeli lobbyists.
Mr Bush said yesterday that his administration's policy might be risky for
his re-election campaign this year, but that he would not 'shift the foreign
policy of this country because of political expediency.'
In purely electoral terms, however, he and the Republican party have little
to lose, since the Democrats habitually win over 70 per cent of Jewish
votes.
Many members of Congress have concluded, moreover, that they can afford to
oppose the loan guarantees.

MR Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's deputy prime minister, said yesterday Israel
would reject a US ultimatum linking the provision of Dollars 10bn (Pounds
5.7bn) in loan guarantees to a halt on Jewish settlements in the occupied
territories.
He warned that if the Jewish state accepted this ultimatum, it would find
itself under pressure to succumb to further American demands in the future.
'Any government - I hope a responsible government, and Israel is one - will
draw a line and say no. Don't pile on pressure when it comes to human
consideration. We will stand and we will not adopt this draconian choice
between land and people,' Mr Netanyahu told reporters in the first official
reaction to the ultimatum to come out of prime minister Yitzhak Shamir's
office. Mr Shamir himself remained silent.
Ever since it became clear Washington would issue the ultimatum, some
Israeli politicians have said the US may be using the loan guarantees in
order to bring down Mr Shamir's hard-line government.
It is widely believed the Americans would prefer the more dovish Labour
party, which favours a significant slowdown if not a complete halt to
settlement activities, to emerge victorious in the June elections.
Explaining why Israel could not accept the US conditions, Mr Netanyahu said:
'What do we have next? Pressure on relinquishing East Jerusalem? Pressure on
absorbing or receiving in Israel millions of Arab refugees?'
Mr Yitzhak Moda'i, the finance minister, has let it be known that his
ministry is formulating contingency plans for raising money to absorb Soviet
Jews, should the loan guarantee request be rejected. Ministry officials say
these plans include a rapid acceleration of the country's privatisation
programme and an appeal for aid from world Jewry.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Stark choice for white voters: Patti Waldmeir on doomsday
threats in S Africa's referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARE YOU going to vote for a good future, or a good past?
This is the question that over the next three weeks Mr Derek Christophers, a
member of parliament for the ruling National party, will put to thousands of
his constituents in the conservative Johannesburg suburb of Germiston. He
will lunch them, dine them, visit them at home, to plead for their support
in South Africa's March 17 referendum. His message is simple: 'Vote for us,
or vote for war.'
The referendum, the date for which was announced on Monday by President F W
de Klerk, will face South Africa's whites with the biggest political choice
they have ever been asked to make: whether to abandon their 350-year
position of dominance in favour of sharing power with a black majority, or
to fight for racial purity in a homeland which would become an international
pariah.
'All the (opposition) Conservatives can offer people,' says Mr Christophers,
who helped plan the National party's campaign, 'is a good past.' His party's
message that a 'yes' vote would lead to a prosperous and secure future.
As could be expected, the wording of the question favours the ruling party
and is designed to be vague enough to win approval from all but the most
committed white supremacist: 'Do you support continuation of the reform
process which the State President began on 2nd February, 1990, and which is
aimed at a new constitution through negotiation?'
February 2, 1990, was the date on which Mr de Klerk legalised black
political opposition.
On the other hand, the proffered consequences of a 'no' vote are designed to
concentrate the mind: Mr de Klerk would resign and call a general election,
which the Conservatives would win on a pro-apartheid ticket.
Black liberation groups would resume violent struggle, and international
sanctions would be applied with a vengeance. Skilled whites would emigrate,
international lending would stop, and South Africa's future would be bleaker
than ever.
Mr de Klerk is clearly hoping that the NP, liberals and everyone to the left
of the most hard-line racist will turn out to avoid that outcome.
But he knows that his support is based more on fear of the alternative than
positive approval of his policies, which are too vague to inspire much
confidence.
He is, in effect, asking for a blank cheque to negotiate a power-sharing
constitution, which amounts to black rule without black domination. While
few whites - even in the ruling party - really believe he can achieve that,
but the campaign could turn on Mr de Klerk's powers of persuasion as he is
called on to defend his policies in detail for preventing domination.
On the other hand, many whites will not want to pass up their last chance to
keep blacks out of power, knowing they will be given no further opportunity
to stop the reform process. If Mr de Klerk wins, he will implement a new
constitution without seeking ratification.
But the 'no' vote will be diluted by divisions on the right: the ultra-right
Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement) has called for
a boycott, and other radical groups could follow suit.
Moreover, at the national level, every mass circulation daily in the country
will push for a 'yes' vote.
And though the state-controlled South African Broadcasting Corporation will
probably guarantee equal air time for opponents and proponents, its
political bias is likely to show through as clearly now as in the past: the
SABC supports the ruling party.
The Conservatives have a formidable political machine at local level, and
are, according to Mr Christophers, 'all prepared to die for their party.'
Yet, when the Conservatives launched their campaign yesterday with a live
radio broadcast from leader Andries Treurnicht, the effect was far from
scintillating.
The lacklustre Mr Treurnicht referred several times to the possibility of
defeat - he and other top party leaders are understood to have preferred a
boycott, but their caucus insisted on a fight - and with his subdued
delivery and outdated rhetoric he did little to inspire the troops.
Indeed, the urbane and modern Mr de Klerk would win a straight personality
contest hands-down.
But the question facing South Africa's 3m white voters is more elemental
than that: Afrikaners feel their language, their culture, their history are
at risk; other whites fear economic penury.
Mr de Klerk's performance may be more impressive, but Mr Treurnicht's
message - that whites can only survive in a separate homeland loosely
federated to neighbouring black states - strikes a powerful chord.

<TEXT>
THE founder of South Korea's Hyundai group, who has launched a party to
challenge President Roh Tae-woo's government, blamed the government
yesterday for the financial woes of the group's subsidiaries, Reuter reports
from Seoul.
'Hyundai risks defaulting on bills due to the government's persistent credit
control and tax investigation imposed on group subsidiaries,' Mr Chung
Ju-yung, 70, was quoted as saying by a spokesman for his National
Unification Party.
Mr Roh's ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) attacked Mr Chung's statement
as a ploy to win public sympathy before next month's general elections.
'Chung is resorting to blackmail. . . in a bid to fulfil his political
ambition, making an illicit use of Hyundai group,' Mr Park Bum-jin, a DLP
spokesman, said.
Mr Chung initially refused to pay Won136.1bn (Pounds 101.8m) in penalty
taxes but later changed his mind. Since then, domestic banks have frozen
fresh loans to the group, the tax office has launched a second tax
investigation and the Securities Supervisory Board has postponed approval on
Hyundai units' rights issues for the sixth time, Hyundai officials said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE government of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa was greatly embarrassed yesterday by
the return parliamentary appearance of a former prime minister, Mr Zenko
Suzuki, who told of his dealings with a bankrupt leisure club developer and
admitted to receiving Y10m (Pounds 44,600) from an indicted politician for
services rendered.
For the Japanese public, the polite grilling of Mr Suzuki, 81, who retired
as MP two years ago, highlighted the unsavoury, though not illegal, contacts
cultivated by politicians seeking to fund networks of influence in the
ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP).
Opposition parties had demanded that Mr Suzuki and another senior LDP
member, Mr Jun Shiozaki, 76, appear to answer questions about their dealings
with Kyowa Corporation, a now bankrupt property and steel company, and links
to Mr Fumio Abe, an LDP member recently indicted on charges of accepting
Y90m in bribes from Kyowa.
The opposition had delayed the passage of Japan's budget to force the LDP to
produce Mr Suzuki. It was suggested that he could not appear because of
ill-health, but a magazine picture of Mr Suzuki clearly enjoying a round of
golf prompted the ruling party to insist that the elder statesman explain
how he came to be honorary chairman of a never-completed Kyowa leisure club.
Mr Suzuki admitted that Mr Abe, on the announcement of his much cherished
appointment to the cabinet in 1989, had given him a brown envelope, though
the former leader said he was surprised to find that it contained Y10m from
his grateful associate. He suggested that he did not want the money, though
he kept it 'on behalf of' Mr Abe, returning the same amount to him in
November of last year.
Mr Shiozaki expressed similar surprise at receiving Y20m from Kyowa after he
had intervened on the company's behalf to settle a dispute with Marubeni,
the famed trading house.
A stern Mr Suzuki, who led the country from 1980 to 1982, denied allegations
that he had received another Y100m from Kyowa after he had agreed to become
honorary chairman of its planned club. He also said that a widely reported
comment that 'you can't question me, I'm a former prime minister' was
wrongly attributed to him and explained that he attended a Kyowa factory
opening because 'I wanted to visit my grandchildren' in the same district.
The Justice Ministry said yesterday investigations into the Kyowa case had
concluded, and no further charges would be laid. However, the scandal has
shaken Mr Miyazawa, as it has centred on political fund raising by senior
officials within his LDP faction.
Meanwhile, a Japanese court yesterday gave a suspended two and a half year
sentence to Mr Fujio Tashiro, a former member of the opposition Komeito
(Clean Government party), after finding him guilty of accepting a Y10m bribe
from an association of gravel and stone shippers.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Stock losses scandal emerges in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance is examining disclosures that stockbrokers
manipulated losses on client portfolios to help the customers window-dress
their accounts.
The affair could further erode investors' faith in the Japanese stock
market, which was last year hit by scandals involving brokers' links with
gangsters and the payment of compensation to favoured clients. The Nikkei
index rose yesterday by 52 points to 21,025.55, but securities companies'
stocks fell.
The ministry's probe will centre on accounting practices which have brought
significant losses to some brokers, among them Cosmo Securities, a
medium-sized company. Cosmo's chairman and vice-president have resigned to
take responsibility for a Y36bn (Pounds 160m) loss, which has wiped out
about a third of Cosmo's shareholders' capital.
Daiwa Securities, one of the Big Four companies, and Yamatane Securities,
another medium-sized house, have also disclosed similar disputes over
portfolio losses with clients. Daiwa has settled a dispute with Tokyo Land,
a leading real estate group, by paying out Y3.5bn. Yamatane is still
negotiating with two clients over a claim for Y690m.
Brokers say disclosure of similar cases in the next few months is
inevitable, particularly with many companies closing their books at the end
of the financial year in March. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, told
journalists yesterday that following last year's arguments over the payment
of loss compensation it was over-optimistic to think that disputes between
brokers and clients had ended.
The latest disclosures involve brokers transferring loss-making stock
portfolios from one client to another to help the first client window-dress
annual accounts. The second client accepts the portfolio in return for a fee
and a guarantee that the broker will buy back the portfolio.
In the past, such portfolios were transferred from one client to another,
with few hiccups. By using clients with different book-closing dates,
brokers could keep the network going for a long time in the hope that a
recovery in stock prices would eventually pull the offending portfolio out
of the red.
Although such window-dressing is frowned upon by the Finance Ministry,
brokers were under great pressure from clients. In some cases, they may also
have felt obliged to arrange repurchase agreements because of no-loss
guarantees given to the original clients. In other words, brokers
window-dressed client accounts to save their own as as well as the
customers' skins.
However, the transactions seem to have run foul of the revision of the
Securities and Exchange Law, which followed last year's scandals and which
outlawed the practice of brokers' guaranteeing to buy back stock at a
pre-set price. No longer could a broker promise to buy back shares  - even
if the pledge only covered a short period of time when shares were parked
with one client on behalf of the other.
In Cosmo's case, the broker transferred a loss-making portfolio from an
unnamed company to the account of Skylark, a restaurant operator. The
unnamed company refused to take the securities back so Skylark sued Cosmo
and settled for Y36bn compensation.
According to Cosmo, the transactions were the work of an individual employee
who forged papers needed to transfer the losses to Skylark.
Daiwa also said its dispute involved the work of a single employee carrying
out unauthorised transactions.
The disclosures highlight the scale of losses suffered by investors in the
Japanese stock market since shares plunged in early 1990. 'These cases are
the tip of the iceberg,' said Mr Peter Tasker, research manager at the Tokyo
office of Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank. The total capitalisation
of companies listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange has
dropped from Y590,000bn at the end of 1989 to less than Y350,000bn.
For smaller houses, which are operating deeply in the red because of the
slump in stock exchange turnover, heavy portfolio losses may spell the end
of their independent survival.
The Securities Bureau of the Finance Ministry, which in the heyday of the
bull market, staunchly opposed the entry of banks into the securities market
is now changing tack. Seeing banks as potential saviours of loss-bound
broking companies, it is considering raising from 5 per cent to 50 per cent
the maximum stake a bank can hold in a securities company.
Japan's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) has concluded the country's six biggest
corporate groups are becoming less reliant on in-house dealings and their
extensive cross-shareholdings do not lead to exclusionary business
practices, Robert Thomson reports from Tokyo. The findings will be presented
in Washington today to a follow-up meeting for the US-Japan Structural
Impediments Initiative, designed to remove 'structural' barriers to trade
with Japan and cut the US-Japanese trade deficit. The corporate groupings,
or keiretsu, head a list of US concerns about access to the Japanese market;
it is unlikely the FTC report, based on a study of the groups' dealings in
1989, will satisfy Washington.

The US has long claimed jurisdiction over anti-competitive activity outside

FT  26 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Donors set to agree on unused tied aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AID donors are expected this week to agree on how to deal with the tied-aid
overhang (unused credit lines) resulting from the recent ban on using tied
credits for projects in better-off developing countries.
Staff at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
say just four of its 24 members have so far given details of the overhang,
but this should not prevent agreement on 'transition rules' for dealing with
it. They do not yet know how big the overhang is, but have asked member
governments to supply details of unused lines of tied aid by March 15.
Transition rules will vary according to the intention of the creditor
government when bilateral credits were agreed. It is likely credits linked
to specific projects will be given the go-ahead. Credits not assigned will
'expire' if unused after an agreed time.
The OECD has striven to ban the use of aid for commercially viable projects,
and for projects in wealthier developing countries. On February 15, rules
for such a ban came into force, with members able to limit abuse by vetting
each other's aid projects.
It is hoped the ban will let aid funds be channelled to development projects
genuinely unable to attract commercial funding, ensuring aid funds are
additional to, rather than competing against, commercial loans for
potentially profitable projects.
Controversy erupted two weeks before the ban came into force when Spain
launched large lines of export credit to Mexico and Venezuela, countries
that two weeks ago became ineligible for tied-aid funding. These credits
were among the five biggest concessional credits the OECD ever recorded.
They will be included in the overhang, as will all other recently-agreed
credits. All will be subject to transitional arrangements.

FT  26 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Tokyo plans industrial tariff cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN will announce tariff cuts on a range of industrial items in imminent
multilateral negotiations, but has apparently decided not to replace its
rice import ban with a new tariff schedule.
The Japanese proposals, to be presented on March 1 in the Uruguay Round
talks, provide for average industrial tariffs to be cut from 3.6 to 1.9 per
cent, improving on its offer to reduce the level to 2.4 per cent. But the
agriculture ministry insists a concession on rice imports is not needed,
despite a Gatt directive that member nations submit by this weekend a list
of tariffs to replace all bans and other import curbs on food items.
The foreign ministry said yesterday the tariffication of rice imports was
still being discussed, but the government had tacitly agreed rice would be
either left off the list or mentioned, though no tariff figure will be
proposed. Japanese officials admit fresh political scandals have prompted
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to keep the rice import ban. The
popularity rating of Premier Kiichi Miyazawa has dipped over the past few
weeks, and the LDP fears a concession on rice will quicken that decline.
Farm officials say the US and EC have yet to settle their differences over
food trade, and Japan would be foolish to submit a tariff figure for rice at
this stage. They suggest the longer Japan holds out against foreign
pressure, the more the government can argue it defended farmers' interests.
Mr Michio Watanabe, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, has
suggested an initial rice tariff of 700 per cent would successfully limit
the flow of rice imports, but the agriculture ministry argues Japan would
compromise its negotiating position by submitting a figure on March 1.
As for industrial products, Japan will propose tariffs be scrapped on about
1,000 items, including transportation machinery. But the government has yet
to decide on rates for non-ferrous metals, for which the US and EC have
demanded cuts, while the tariff for leather products, important politically,
is likely to be cut from about 60 to 40 per cent.

THE US and Mexico unveiled their long-awaited border environment plan
yesterday, a key component of their strategy to persuade US Congressmen to
support the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
Mr William Reilly, head of the US environmental protection agency, presented
the plan in Los Angeles, claiming: 'Never have two nations developed so
extensive a plan to improve health and environment along their entire
border'. Mexico's environment minister made a simultaneous presentation in
Tijuana, Baja California.
Under the pact, Mexico will spend Dollars 460m (Pounds 262.8m) over three
years (Dollars 147m in 1992) on water treatment and other public works,
doubling the number of environmental inspectors, and toughening regulation
of Mexican-based industries.
The US proposes spending in its 1993 budget Dollars 179m on border
environmental protection, of which Dollars 170m is earmarked for waste-water
treatment. But the fear that the border environment will deteriorate in the
event of Mexican-US free trade has become a focus of opposition to Nafta in
Congress.

<TEXT>
THIRTEEN former Soviet republics yesterday signed a communique demanding
that Vnesheconombank, the Moscow-based conduit for the repayment of hard
currency debt, be removed from Russian jurisdiction. Russia, however, was
pointedly absent from the meeting of prime ministers and their deputies
representing all other former Soviet republics, including the Baltics.
The proposal - another foray in the economic battle between Ukraine and
Russia - would place Vnesheconombank under the control of a new inter-state
council in which all former Soviet republics, including the Baltics but not
Georgia, would have one vote. Vnesheconombank is now governed by an
inter-state council in which Russia has 61 per cent of the vote.
The idea is to be discussed at the Commonwealth of Independent States
meeting on March 20.
A report by Salomon Brothers, the New York-based merchant bankers, warned
yesterday that western commercial banks faced the 'almost certain prospect'
of a moratorium on principal debt repayments by the former Soviet republics
throughout this year. This was because the republics were more preoccupied
with their own domestic problems and were suspicious of Russia's role in
negotiating the debt.
Ukraine's said after yesterday's meeting in Kiev that were control of
Vnesheconombank to change it might be willing to accept collective
responsibility with the other republics for former Soviet debt.
European Community external affairs commissioner Frans Andriessen, in Kiev
yesterday, underlined the pressure on Ukraine by insisting that the EC's
promised Dollars 150m line of credit to Ukraine would remain frozen until
Ukraine assumed 'joint and several' responsibility for the debt.
Under the terms of an inter-republican agreement signed last December,
western official creditors agreed to a temporary moratorium on medium and
long-term official debt. This was followed by a temporary moratorium on
payment of principal to commercial banks. A moratorium on official credits
was extended to the end of 1992.
This agreement, which committed each republic towards contributing a share
of the convertible currency needed to make debt-service payments, was a
precondition for assent by official creditors to an extension of the
principal moratorium for all of this year.
Salomon Brothers say that the agreement is almost impossible to implement,
because:
'there is no way to ensure that each republic will contribute to the
debt-service pool, even if they had access to convertible currency income';
'all the republics, particularly Ukraine, are suspicious of the (banking and
financial) apparatus that appears to be under the control of the Russian
republic'; 'although the G7 (group of industrialised countries) warned the
constituent republics that their specific creditworthiness would be harmed
if the debt is not fully serviced, it is doubtful if the political elite in
many republics are overly concerned with international creditworthiness at a
time when popular discontent with food prices and shortages is the major
concern'.

FT  26 FEB 92 / US says CSCE could use Nato force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATO, which is seeking a new role for itself following the end of the Cold
War, could become the military arm of the recently expanded 48-nation
pan-European security forum, a senior US official suggested yesterday.
'Nobody foresees a military structure for the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe,' Mr John Kornblum, chief US delegate to the CSCE
review conference, which opens in Helsinki next month, said in a satellite
television broadcast linking Washington with five European countries.
'But the US would probably find it useful if Nato was one of the agencies
for providing troops for the CSCE.' Mr Kornblum went out of his way to
counter perceptions that the CSCE - grouping the western allies, members of
the defunct Warsaw Pact and the newly independent republics of the former
Soviet Union - was incapable of taking effective action because of its rule
that decisions should be taken by consensus.
That impression had been fostered by its failure to adopt a decisive role in
solving the Yugoslav crisis. But it should be realised that the new
structure of the CSCE had only just been put in place when the Yugoslav
crisis broke out and that, in any case, the organisation was never intended
to enforce solutions by military means. 'Our first purpose is not crisis
management, but crisis and conflict prevention,' Mr Kornblum said.
Rejecting the idea that there was a duplication of roles between the CSCE
and the new Nato Co-operation Council, created as a link between the North
Atlantic allies, eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics, Mr Kornblum
said the organisations were complementary.
The CSCE, with a much wider membership, provided a broad political
blue-print for dealing with the complex situation created by the
disintegration of Cold War structures. Nato was much more narrowly focused
on security issues and did not cover important areas such as human rights,
confidence-building measures and economic problems.
One of the main tasks of the Helsinki review conference would be to enhance
the CSCE's ability to take concerted action.
A cautious step in this direction had been taken at the recent CSCE
ministerial meeting in Prague, when it was agreed that a single member state
could be overridden if found guilty of 'clear and gross violation' of its
CSCE commitments. But consensus would nevertheless remain the 'cardinal
principle' for decision-making, Mr Kornblum said.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Commission to fine Aer Lingus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FINE on Aer Lingus, the Irish national carrier, for refusing to grant
reciprocal ticketing rights to British Midland, the UK airline, is to be
announced by the European Commission today.
The Brussels competition directorate believes Aer Lingus's move to scrap a
long-standing 'inter-lining' agreement with British Midland in 1989 - just
when the latter started flying to Dublin - constituted an illegal abuse of
the Irish carrier's dominant position on the London-Dublin route.
Inter-lining agreements allow travel agents to issue passengers with a
single ticket permitting them to change airlines on different legs of their
journeys.
Brussels favours such agreements because they give customers more
flexibility and because they make it easier for airlines to pick up
passengers on new routes, encouraging entry into the market.
Last year's withdrawal by British Airways from the London-Dublin route has
helped both Aer Lingus and British Midland since.
Inter-lining agreements are common between EC airlines, but not obligatory.
However, according to the EC competition directorate, in reacting to direct
route competition from British Midland by scrapping the ticketing agreement
it had had with the UK airline since 1964, the Irish carrier was abusing its
dominant position in flights to and from the Irish capital.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Israel demands permanent right of settlement: Confidential
plan for occupied territories dismays Arab delegates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS and LAMIS ANDONI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL has presented the Arab delegations at the Middle East peace talks
with a plan for Palestinian self-rule under which Israelis would have the
right to live and settle in the occupied territories indefinitely.
The hard-line Israeli proposal, understood to have been put forward in
Washington on Monday, falls far short of the arrangements that Israel agreed
to 10 years ago.
Arab delegates said yesterday they were dismayed both by the content and the
tone of the document. They said it indicated that Israel, far from wishing
to allow genuine Palestinian self-rule, was determined to tighten its
control over the occupied territories.
While they recognise that the latest plan is part of a tough Israeli
negotiating stance, some Arab delegates question how much longer they can
remain involved in the Middle East peace process.
Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi said the Israeli ideas were 'an insult
to our intelligence' because they perpetuate the Israeli occupation and
endorse continued Jewish settlements.
She said the Palestinian negotiators would refuse to take up self-rule until
the issues of settlements and human rights in lands the Arabs lost in the
1967 Six-Day War are resolved.
The US has avoided commenting on the details of the negotiations, but Mr
James Baker, the US secretary of state, will take little comfort from the
Israeli proposals.
Mr Baker announced on Monday that Israel would only be granted the Dollars
10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) in loan guarantees it has requested if it agrees to stop
building new settlements in the West Bank, Gaza and Golan Heights.
Under agreements negotiated between Israel, the US and Egypt at Camp David
in 1978, and at subsequent meetings up to mid-1981, it was agreed that the
Palestinians should enjoy 'full autonomy' for a five-year period before the
final status of the territories was negotiated.
Israel also proposed at Camp David to end its military government and
withdraw its forces to specified security zones following free elections for
a self-governing Palestinian authority. The Palestinians were to be given a
large measure of responsibility for managing their own affairs.
In the latest, confidential Israeli proposals outlined to the US and the
Arab delegations, Israel:
Has dropped any suggestion of a redeployment of the army.
Makes no mention of an elected authority.
Insists that it will have sole responsibility for security in all its
aspects.
In addition, Israel stresses that self-rule will apply only to people, not
to land; that all existing links between Israel and the occupied territories
will remain; and that there will be full 'co-operation and co-ordination'
between the interim self-governing authority and the Israeli government.
The Palestinian body would not have any authority over Israelis living in
the occupied territories or for Arabs in east Jerusalem.
The Palestinians and other Arab delegations have demanded the withdrawal of
Israeli forces and the right to self-determination.
In a meeting with Palestinian delegation leaders last week Mr Baker had
urged them to be patient and await his announcement on loan guarantees, to
remain within the peace process and to concentrate on making positive
proposals for self-rule.
Mr Benyamin Netanyahu, a senior aid to Israeli prime minister Yitzak Shamir,
took a combative stance last night to the US demand for a halt to new Jewish
settlements on occupied Arab lands. He warned in a television interview that
Israel would take its case to the American people.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Record loss on UK loans hits NatWest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RECORD LOSSES on UK loans in 1991 led to a collapse in the profits of
National Westminster Bank to their lowest level since 1975.
As a result, the bank plans to cut staff numbers by at least 4,000 this
year, having shed 6,400 jobs last year.
Separately, NatWest faced allegations yesterday that UK customers were being
forced to pay, in the form of higher charges, for the bank's lending
mistakes, because it also disclosed that its income from fees and
commissions last year had risen sharply.
NatWest's pre-tax profits last year dropped by 78 per cent to Pounds 110m
due to a bad debt charge of Pounds 1.99bn, which included losses on UK
lending of Pounds 1.45bn, the biggest ever incurred by a UK bank.
The poor results - which meant that NatWest had to withdraw Pounds 220m from
reserves to pay a maintained dividend of 17.5p a share - represent a sharp
reversal in its fortunes. Only three years ago the bank made pre-tax profits
of Pounds 1.41bn, more than any other UK bank before or since.
Nonetheless, its trading surplus last year rose 20 per cent to a record
Pounds 2.03bn, largely due to a sharp rise in commissions. Lord Alexander,
NatWest chairman, said the bank had pushed up the charges paid by UK
customers and had new computerised monitoring techniques to ensure that an
increased proportion of eligible customers paid their charges.
Ms Jean Eaglesham, of the Consumers Association, said: 'Customers are paying
extra charges to compensate for the bank's lending mistakes.'
Only Lloyds Bank has made a bigger charge than NatWest to cover the risk of
bad debts. However, Lloyds' 1989 charge of Pounds 2.1bn largely reflected
difficulties on loans to less-developed countries rather than loans to UK
customers.
NatWest's bad debt charge meant that its UK financial services division  -
the heart of its business and including its 2,816 branches - incurred a
loss, its first ever, of Pounds 5m.
Lord Alexander said there had been 'some departures from the principles of
sound lending'. However, he said no NatWest executives or managers had lost
their jobs as a direct result of the loan losses.
Mr Tom Frost, who has been group chief executive since 1987 and retires next
year, said it was bad banking practice to sack staff for making bad loans.
Bankers 'would not lend any money at all' if they feared their jobs were on
the line for lending mistakes.
However, the group reduced staff numbers by 6,400 last year largely through
a voluntary redundancy programme. 'I expect to see that trend continue,' Mr
Frost said. 'At least 4,000 jobs will go this year.'
NatWest's losses on loans to the Maxwell empire were much lower than many
had expected, at about Pounds 50m, according to analysts.
The bulk of bad debt charges arose on loans to small and medium-size
businesses and to personal customers.
Lord Alexander said he was hopeful that bad debt charges would fall this
year.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Increased share of premiums for life salesmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICY HOLDERS paid a larger slice of their life assurance premiums to
salesmen last year, according to Lautro, the UK insurance industry's
self-regulatory body.
In a study released yesterday Lautro found that commissions paid to tied
agents, including banks and building societies which sell the products of
one company only, have risen much more than those paid to independent
financial advisers.
In the 18 months since Lautro's last survey, average commissions to tied
agents have risen as a proportion of premiums by 3-6 percentage points,
depending on the product. Those paid to independent advisers have risen an
average of 1-2 percentage points.
More than 90 per cent of firms surveyed said they were also prepared to make
loans to tied agents, typically equal to half the expected commissions paid
in a single year. Twelve per cent make additional cash gifts to tied agents
beyond commission payments.
Mr Michael Pickard, chairman of Royal London Mutual Life and head of the
Association of British Insurers' life council, said the rise in commissions
reflected 'market conditions'.
'Companies want to secure distribution,' he said, explaining that building
societies, with ready access to potential customers, have been able to
command particularly high commission payments.
The Lautro data mean that someone buying a conventional 25-year
mortgage-linked endowment policy, paying monthly premiums of Pounds 50,
yields an average commission of Pounds 570 to a tied agent, up from Pounds
534 in the last survey.
Typically commissions are paid at the outset, although salesmen may have to
fund a portion of them if the policy is terminated soon afterwards.
Thus, a sales agent selling two policies a week, with a fortnight's holiday
a year, could have an annual pre-tax income of up to Pounds 64,152.
Independent advisers averaged Pounds 498 in commission for selling a similar
policy.
A survey last year by the Securities and Investments Board found that up to
44 per cent of insurance and pensions policies sold by tied agents were
terminated within the first two years.
Regulators believe that high termination rates are linked to mis-selling -
the practice of urging consumers to purchase inappropriate policies.
Since industry-wide ceilings on commissions were scrapped at the insistence
of the Office of Fair Trading at the end of December 1989, those earned by
tied agents have risen above the old limits by an average of 47 per cent for
10-year endowment policies and 44 per cent for 25-year policies.
For 10-year pensions the average increase is 44 per cent, and for 25-year
policies the figure is 40 per cent.
The Consumers' Association, said: 'These figures are phenomenally
depressing, but they are not surprising.'

Ambitions widen across the world - Profile: Banco de Santander
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST YEAR Mr Emilio Botin, chairman of Banco de Santander, sold a bank
network in Spain and bought a sizeable stake of a US bank. He told
Santander's annual general meeting this month that he was 'very satisfied'
with the investment.
Santander is not going to disinvest from Spain in order to concentrate on
global banking. The domestic market remains very much the foundation of the
group's business and this was underscored by the opening of 107 Santander
bank branches in Spain last year and by the launching, with considerable
publicity, of innovative mutual fund products.
But 1991's twin developments, on the home and the external fronts, were a
clear indication of widening ambitions; Mr Botin stressed to shareholders
the growing internationalisation of the Santander group.
By the end of last year, 36 per cent of the group's assets were based in a
total of 27 foreign countries. The assets, a combination of subsidiary
banks, finance companies and branches of the parent bank, contributed some
Dollars 200m, or 27 per cent to the group's consolidated profits.
The objective, according to Santander's chairman, is to lift the non-Spanish
contribution to the group's income, from diversified businesses in different
countries, to 33 per cent of the total. With such a target in mind
acquisitions and investment are more likely to be abroad than on the
domestic front in the coming months.
Santander certainly has a treasure chest to draw on should it wish to buy.
It raised its net profits by 17.8 per cent last year to Pta75.1bn (Dollars
777m), increased its Return on Assets (ROA) from 1.30 per cent to 1.36 per
cent, put aside Pta64bn as provisions for reserves, an amount that doubled
the non-recurring profits generated last year, and augmented its BIS capital
adequacy from 10.5 per cent two years ago to 13.2 per cent in 1991.
Last year Santander paid Dollars 220m to acquire 13.5 per cent of First
Fidelity Bancorporation, the 23rd largest financial group in the US, with an
option to increase the equity to 23.4 per cent. It was the first Spanish
bank to step meaningfully into the US market and a subsequent placement of
Dollars 150m preferential share on the American market fuelled expectations
that it was seeking further properties in the US.
Other European banks acquiring US institutions have encountered mixed
fortunes. Mr Botin attributed the success of the First Fidelity venture to
three principles: Santander paid a satisfactory price for its equity, it
limited its capital commitment and it supported a skilled management team
which was already in place. Only two Santander nominees joined the First
Fidelity board and both were senior group executives with long track records
in US banks.
Back at home, Santander sold Banca Jover, a subsidiary based in Catalonia,
to Credit Lyonnais, the French giant which had a year earlier bought another
Santander network, Banco Comercial. The group still owns Banco de Murcia, a
profitable 66-branch network in south-east Spain, and Mr Botin says that 'if
the price is right' he sees no reason why this subsidiary should not be
likewise sold to either domestic or foreign buyers.
No less important to the international profile of Santander group are the
manner in which it has built on its traditional activities in Latin America
and the onset of wholly new business prospects in Europe that result from
the parent bank's now four-year-old alliance with Royal Bank of Scotland.
The group was quick to focus on financial possibilities in Mexico where it
earned goodwill by providing Dollars 100m of financing in the privatisation
of Bancomer, one of the largest privatisations in Latin America.
Last year, Banco Santander de Negocios, the group's merchant bank offshoot,
was awarded the underwriting for the first Pta10bn issue of Matador bonds
for the United Mexican States. There followed a second issue of Matador
bonds for the Interamerican Development Bank at the end of last year and a
third, last month for the Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior de Mexico.
In what is evidently a strategy that the group will pursue in other Latin
American climates, Santander broadened its retail banking activities in
Chile by consolidating its life insurance and leasing subsidiaries and by
setting up Chile's first factoring company.
In Europe the bank's pet project is IBOS, an acronym for Interbank On-line
System. This electronic banking venture, has been developed jointly with the
Royal Bank of Scotland, a bank in which Santander owns a 10 per cent stake
under a cross share agreement, and Mr Botin hails it as the 'most innovative
and efficient (project) of the European Single Market'.
A sophisticated update of an existing real-time banking interconnection
between Santander and the Royal Bank of Scotland, IBOS has already been
introduced into Banco de Comercio e Industria in Portugal and CC-Bank in
Germany which are both jointly owned by Santander and Royal Bank of
Scotland. The plan is to allow access to the system for as many banks as
wish to join the network.

Vision of a grand strategy fades - Talk about a single stock market
continues, but ..
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR ago, the European Community's stock exchanges were at each others'
throats in a thinly disguised squabble over whether or not to co-operate on
developing a single European stock market. That venture - known as Euroquote
 -came to nothing, just as a similar project had been scrapped several years
before.
This year, the diplomats of the Euro-financial world are going about things
rather differently. There have been no grand visionary pronouncements about
the shape of the European market to come, and no public tiffs. But the
talking is going on just the same.
Three things are different this time around. The first results from the
fall-out over the Euroquote debacle. This established that there was no
point in the various exchanges getting together to build a new
price-dissemination system for Europe when plenty of existing systems could
either already do the job, or be developed to do it. Re-inventing the wheel
was not something that the UK and Germany, in particular, wanted to do.
As a result, discussions are unlikely to return to the subject of how to
build a common market infrastructure - at least not until there is agreement
on what the common market should be. That gives any discussions that take
place a more sensible grounding.
The second change has been an apparent cooling of hostilities over the EC's
proposed Investment Services Directive. Initially conceived as a step to
give non-bank investment firms a 'single passport' to operate across the
Community, the ISD had dissolved by last year into a fight over rival market
structures.
One side was driven by the belief that investors are best protected if
trading is centralised on to national exchanges, and trade publication rules
tightened: the other, by the view that free-wheeling, cross-border
professional markets (such as that for Eurobonds) thrive if left to take
care of themselves. That ideological divide (some say it was fuelled by
competitive pressures) now seems less stark than it did.
This is partly because cultural differences between national investment
practices are being eroded. For instance, many continental stockbrokers are
looking forward to the time when they have home-grown pension funds similar
to those in the UK or US. As investment patterns converge, regulations and
market structure will follow.
Another reason is that competition is driving market practice closer, as
national markets copy and (where possible) improve upon the most successful
practices of other European centres. Take France, which has officially been
in the vanguard of the fight to re-regulate markets: its stockbrokers have
recently been agitating for greater deregulation.
already has a thriving deregulated international share market, conducted by
telephone in London and supported by the SEAQ International price quotation
system. Its success seems to indicate that, whatever the regulators rule,
there will always be a demand for a professional market relatively free of
externally-imposed regulations. If the EC outlaws it, then financial centres
such as London say the market will simply move offshore and the EC will be
the loser.
The future of the Investment Services Directive has yet to be resolved. But
the forces at work behind the scenes suggest that tensions over this issue
could gradually ease.
The third change lying behind this year's discussions between European
exchanges is the fact that individual national markets in the EC have moved
ahead with their own market reforms. These have taken two broad forms:
deregulation and automation.
Germany, for instance, has achieved some modest success with its new version
of the Ibis screen-based dealing system. As more business is done on Ibis,
so more banks are prepared to use it. One leading London house reports that
it now does around a quarter of its German share business on Ibis, compared
with 10 per cent a year ago. That reduces the need for Seaq International.
The more developed continental markets become, the more willing their
national market authorities will be to discuss co-operation. This is
because, until now, their relative lack of development has left them feeling
vulnerable to London: none has felt confident negotiating from a position of
weakness.
Discussions about co-operation between national exchanges are already under
way on a number of fronts. Work is in train to bring national listings
requirements closer together to make it easier for companies to be listed
across European markets, for instance. The national markets already pool
statistics.
These developments could be the low-key forerunner to further co-operation.
As Mr Rudiger von Rosen, vice-chairman of the Federation of German Stock
Exchanges, says: 'They might not look as spectacular as Euroquote, but
everyone is glad they are going ahead.'
Reviving Euroquote is 'definitely not a topic that will come up in 1992', he
adds. But if market participants demand extra services, the exchanges say
they are ready and willing to act. That could happen either through
bilateral arrangements (such as the sharing of prices, which already happens
between Paris and Frankfurt) or multilaterally, says Mr von Rosen.
Demand from investors and European companies may yet bring the exchanges
back to the table to discuss a grander strategy. At present, though, it has
yet to happen.

Bond markets still buoyant - A change in the pattern of corporate funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a marked change in the pattern of corporate funding in Europe last
year as companies moved away from large syndicated bank facilities,
favouring instead simple funding raised from investment institutions and
simple bilateral bank loans.
Only Dollars 94.4bn was raised in the European syndicated loans market last
year, down from Dollars 163.3bn in 1990. In part this reflects a fall in
demand for bank finance as many western European economies moved into
recession.
As a provider of stand-by lines of credit, for example, the syndicated
banking market is the natural source of acquisition finance.
As acquisition activity has fallen away, so the number of companies seeking
bid finance has decreased.
But the decline in syndicated lending also stems from pressure on banks
themselves to rebuild margins following the excesses of the 1980s. This has
increased the cost of bank finance, leading companies to examine other
alternatives.
Some correction in pricing was undoubtedly due. At the peak of the
'borrowers' market' in the late 1980s, banks were fighting each other to
participate in blue-chip corporate loans. Margins fell to an impossibly fine
level.
In 1987, BTR, the UK industrial group, secured Pounds 1bn 5-year committed
funding at a margin of 7.5 basis points over the London interbank offered
rate. The margin on similar transactions has since at least doubled, with
fees rising by a similar proportion.
While the number of syndicated credits has fallen sharply, the bond markets
have remained a ready source of finance for large European corporations.
In the international bond market alone, companies, governments and
supranational agencies raised Dollars 230bn last year, up from Dollars 161bn
in 1990 and Dollars 210bn in 1989 - the previous record.
Like the weakness of the loans market, the buoyancy of bond markets is
partly due to cyclical factors: as interest rates have declined in many
economies, investors have been switching funds into bond market investments.
While the cost of bank finance has risen, yield spreads in the bond market
have fallen to attractive levels.
However, the cyclical buoyancy of bond markets also overlays a longer-term
switch by companies in favour of funding provided by investment institutions
such as insurance companies and pension funds.
Problems experienced by large companies, such as News Corporation, in
re-structuring complex banking facilities has underlined that over-reliance
on a single source of finance can be dangerous. The diversification of
funding is being pursued by corporate treasurers across Europe.
However, only the biggest companies can tap the public Eurobond market. Bond
issues usually have to be of a certain size and liquidity - around Dollars
150m equivalent - to attract investors.
One of the biggest challenges for corporate financiers has been to find a
way for smaller companies to tap investment institutions for debt finance.
An increasing number of European companies are raising debt finance in the
US, placing 'tailored' debt securities with institutional investors. The
size of US debt placements has grown: large European companies, such as
Allied Lyons, have raised Dollars 400m from a single placement of bonds.
The potential of the market for European companies is huge. Of the Dollars
160bn new paper placed last year, foreign companies accounted for just 5 per
cent.
UK companies have been most active, not least because UK accounting
conventions are at least adjacent to US rules. However, following aggressive
marketing by US banks keen to drum up business, companies from France,
Holland and Germany are not far behind.
Those UK companies which have tapped the market - such as Pilkington and NFC
 -often use the proceeds to repay bank debt. In an environment where bank
credit is seen as more restricted and less reliable than in the past,
institutional funding has a utility over and above its competitiveness in
terms of cost.
Within Europe, the private placement market has been largely replaced by the
use of medium-term notes. An MTN programme allows companies to issue bonds,
usually of between one year and 30 years' maturity, under a single legal
framework, placing securities denominated in a range of currencies as
pockets of demand are identified. As in a commercial paper programme,
liquidity is provided by a number of dealing banks tied to the programme.
New European medium-term note programmes set up last year amounted to
Dollars 42bn, up from Dollars 31bn in 1990.
It remains to be seen whether European investment institutions will continue
to embrace the MTN market with any enthusiasm. While MTNs offer investors a
supply of assets tailored to match specific balance sheet requirements, the
perceived illiquidity of the instruments has always been seen as a drawback.
These factors mean that most corporations, even the largest, remain reliant
on bank facilities to manage short-term liquidity.
But styles of bank borrowing have changed. Bilateral loans are replacing
complex, syndicated multiple-option facilities. A more diffuse pattern of
funding is now seen as a prudent response to the retrenchment of banks.
BP, the UK-based oil company which is seen as a bellwether of corporate
treasury activity, last year replaced syndicated bank facilities with a
series of bilateral loans, dramatically reducing the number of banks with
which it deals. Other companies are following the same pattern.
Corporate treasurers note that there is an inherent refunding risk in having
Pounds 1bn bank finance falling due on one day. In addition, the largest
companies realise that they have greatest leverage over lenders when
business is concentrated with just a few key institutions. More bank lenders
does not necessarily mean less risk.

Barriers fall across Europe - Progress towards a single insurance market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLOWLY but surely a single European market in insurance is emerging. Over
the past two years several important planks in the European Community's
legislative programme have been put in place, establishing the basis for
genuine cross- border trading. And European insurance companies are adapting
their strategies to take into account the new opportunities as the barriers
between a series of distinctive national markets fall.
The approval in 1988 of the so-called 'second directive' for non-life
insurance opened the way by liberalising the market for commercial risks
insurance, allowing all companies above medium size (with balance sheets of
more than Ecu17m, net turnover of Ecu33m and more than 500 employees) to buy
their policies from insurers established in any member state.
Most countries have now implemented the national legislation needed to bring
the directive into effect and already there has been something of an opening
up. Traditionally fierce competition for the custom of medium-sized
industrial companies in the French, British and German markets has
intensified, for example, and in areas such as credit risk insurance Dutch
and German companies have taken advantage of the new opportunities to attack
the UK market.
Shortly before Christmas last year European Community ministers approved
another significant plank of legislation: the third non-life directive which
extends this more open regime to the domestic market. Householders and
motorists across the Community will eventually be free to buy their
insurance from companies licensed by any one member state.
Most member states have until 1994 or 1995 to implement the new rules
although the weaker industries of Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Greece have
been given longer to adapt and will not need to implement the new rules
until later in the 1990s.
Progress in the life insurance market, where differences in regulatory and
tax regimes makes harmonisation more difficult, has been slower. Here too it
is intended that the ideas of a single licence - that companies registered
in any one member state should be free to sell their products across the
community - should pave the way for a continental market.
At present, under the terms of the second life directive individuals can buy
life policies from companies registered in other member states but must do
so 'on their own initiative'.
Some UK companies, whose endowment plans are attractive in comparison with
many of their European counterparts, have made modest inroads into the
German market for example.
In the short term the Commission believes its planned directives should
benefit companies from countries with less burdensome regulation, such as
the UK. Over the longer term, increased competition is expected to lead to
harmonisation of regulatory frameworks across the Community.
Although differences in national tax treatment mean imperfections will
remain, a further directive - on insurance company accounts - will at least
make the differences more transparent when introduced. Accounting practices
in continental Europe emphasise prudential considerations, allowing
companies to offer the most cautious and conservative interpretation of
their performance than is common in the more open markets of the UK, Ireland
and the Netherlands.
As the market emerges the continent's leading companies are increasingly
accepting the fact that Europe as a whole will eventually represent their
home market.
Two quite separate strategies have emerged. On the one hand the continent's
stronger companies have begun to acquire subsidiaries in those member states
where it has as yet no presence. Other companies have opted to form
alliances - sacrificing a degree of control in order to use capital more
efficiently. Alliances have become popular both because of the increasing
cost of outright acquisition and as a means of defence by some weaker
players.
Allianz of Germany epitomises the first trend. Its drive to acquire
subsidiaries in most European markets was signalled by its unsuccessful bid
for Eagle Star of the UK in 1984. Subsequently, though, Allianz bought the
Cornhill (the UK's 10th largest insurer) in 1986, bought RAS, Italy's number
two, in 1986, and purchased France's Rhin et Moselle in 1989.
French companies have also followed the acquisition route. Groupe des
Assurances Nationales, Assurances Generales de France and the Union des
Assurances de Paris, have all been helped by the encouragement of their
major shareholder - the French government - which has stressed the strategic
importance of expansion. GAN has made two acquisitions in the UK for
example, UAP has built stakes in the UK's Sun Life and Belgium's Royal
Belge. AGF recently acquired a stake in Spain's Union y El Fenix. Victoire,
the privately-owned company, in which the French government has an interest
via a minority stake held by UAP, paid some DM3.85bn to take over Colonia,
Germany's second biggest insurer in 1989.
Victoire/Colonia is at the heart of an impressive network, which also
includes Baltica, in Denmark, Nordstern in Germany and Nieuw Rotterdam in
the Netherlands.
Partially in response to aggressive foreign interest, some companies have
combined forces. The merger of Nationale Nederlande and NMB Postbank in 1991
was mainly motivated by the defensive considerations of two companies that
have a substantial share of their own restricted domestic markets.
Similar considerations influenced Belgium's AG to merge with Amev of the
Netherlands last year.
Last year three medium-sized insurers - Wasa of Sweden, Centraal Beheer of
the Netherlands and Topdanmark of Denmark - agreed to build up a
jointly-owned European holding company into which they would pool all their
subsidiaries outside their home markets. Friends Provident, the UK life
insurer, has subsequently joined the alliance, entitled Eureko.
But perhaps the most important recent development has been the decision by
three leading European companies - Royal Insurance of the UK, Aachener &amp;
Muenchener of Germany and Fondiaria of Italy - to follow the Eureko example.
Royal has been hit by losses and its weakened balance sheet makes it a prime
target for takeover. AMB, Germany's third biggest insurer, faces huge losses
as a result of its acquisition of a loss making bank in 1987 and has been
stalked by the French company AGF. Fondiaria has fewer short-term problems
but has virtually no presence outside its own domestic market.

Scandals mar City's image - Foreign bankers in London criticise legal and
regulatory structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK DE JACQUELOT, London correspondent, Les Echos
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A STRING of scandals
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the collapse of Polly Peck, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
and the Maxwell Empire - could not have come at a worse time for the City of
London.
Just when the City is trying to persuade other European financial centres to
adopt its practices, these frauds have led some financial institutions to
question whether the City is the best model for European markets.
Many foreign banks have suffered heavy losses in their British operations
over the past two years, much of the losses resulting from these corporate
failures.
The reactions of these banks vary according to their national origin and
their individual strategies. Nonetheless, most say that the prestige of
London has been damaged and that they are likely to scale down their
activities. However, a massive exodus is unlikely.
Most foreign banks blame the severe UK recession for the scale of their loan
losses, which in some cases compare in size with those of UK banks. But
others raise questions about the legal and regulatory structure.
Their criticism is not always accurate or fair. But it demonstrates that the
City has developed an image problem.
Foreign banks began to criticise the legal structure just over a year ago,
when the House of Lords ruled that all swap deals - complicated financial
transactions - carried out with local authorities were illegal. Many foreign
banks had been involved in this market and they therefore faced huge losses
as a result of the ruling.
Bitterness persists. 'We thought London was a free market, where innovation
was possible,' says the managing director of one Continental institution.
'Then the Lords decided that deals made openly for years should never have
taken place]'
An American banker makes a similar point: 'Obviously, foreign institutions
are very concerned if financial transactions they have undertaken in good
faith have unexpected legal consequences. We thought we knew the British
legal system pretty well. But now, we have to wonder what will happen when
trying out other inventive types of transactions.'
More recently, UK accounting and auditing standards have become a target of
criticism from overseas bankers who profess astonishment at the way in which
various leading British groups have collapsed. The problem as they see it is
that accounting rules are much more relaxed in the UK than elsewhere making
it easy to overstate profits or assets.
Auditors, who approve the accounts of companies which have later collapsed,
are criticised severely. Some bankers are concerned that accounting firms
may not be sufficiently rigorous when conducting an audit, if, at the same
time, they are offering other services to that company.
The chief executive of an American merchant bank in London makes a separate
complaint: 'There is a difference between the UK and the US in the potential
liability the auditors face if it is shown they did not exert sufficient
diligence in their audit. So, UK auditors are not quite so terrified of
making a mistake'.
The evolution of market regulation since Big Bang is also questioned. Since
Big Bang, says one German banker, new laws have been introduced which have
put business on a legalistic basis which did not previously exist when he
City operated to the code My Word is my Bond
The regulation of the City is thus viewed as being too much and too little.
Too much, according to an American financier, because it is much more
expensive to abide by than in France or Germany, but too little in the
pension funds area, where the lack of regulation was exposed by Mr Robert
Maxwell's plundering of his companies' pension funds.
As for the role of the Bank of England, some foreign banks compliment the
Bank on its efficiency in the territory it covers, but wish it had broader
responsibilities. Continental bankers are occasionally wistful about the
more interventionist policies of their own central banks, which often play a
more active role in preventing large corporate collapses.
Other bankers also regret that there is not a central register of borrowings
in Britain, as there is in all big continental European countries. Such a
register, which records all bank loans to large companies, could have
prevented lending to the Maxwell empire running out of control, since
bankers would have been alerted earlier to the overall size of the debt. A
German banker says: 'If there had been such a register, the Maxwell disaster
would have been impossible.'
Sharp and wide-ranging as these criticisms may be, they should be viewed
cautiously. The anger among foreign bankers is clearly related to the size
of their losses from doing business in the UK.
That prompts the suspicion that by attacking the City's practices, bankers
are trying to excuse their responsibility for making some imprudent loans in
the British market.
Banks also tend to react differently according to their nationality. French
banks are the most vocal critics of London. Part of the explanation might be
that in the 1980s they increased rapidly their exposure in the UK - their
aggregated loans to the Maxwell empire were second only in size to those of
the British banks.
Another factor might be their disillusionment which followed their great
admiration for London and its Big Bang.
German bankers tend to take a softer line and put the emphasis more on the
UK economy: 'As German banks,' says one of them, 'our view is that the UK
environment is missing the solid economic basis we are used to.'
Americans take a more phlegmatic view. 'In the last resort, it's up to the
banks to protect themselves against crooks and to have a better knowledge of
the market,' says the head of an American institution in London, before
adding that Tokyo and New York have problems, too.
Even the most outspoken critics do agree with this last point: the
regulatory and legal structure is not necessarily better elsewhere.
The Foreign Banks Association is talking to the Bank of England about the
possibility of setting up a register of borrowings. Foreign banks had also
been awaiting with great interest the preliminary report, published last
week, of the committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Alexander, the
chairman of National Westminster Bank, set up to investigate possible
pitfalls and loopholes in the UK legal structure for City business.
Nonetheless, some reduction in the scale of foreign banks' activities in the
UK is likely, with foreign institutions becoming more cautious and scaling
down their operations. 'They will have to keep their presence in London, but
they will not expand as they might have done,' says an American banker.
The role of London as an international financial centre, for foreign
exchange or Euromarkets should not be affected but British companies might
find it more difficult to get credits from foreign banks which, two years
ago, were desperate to lend.

Utopian vision is still blurred - The effects of a single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS arguable whether the buying habits of the European consumer will
change fundamentally at midnight on New Year's eve. The formal opening of a
single European market in 1993 seems unlikely to prompt an upsurge in the
number of penny-pinching Danes driving to Portugal to buy cheap fridges, or
cheeseparing Germans flying to Greece for bargain replacement batteries for
their BMWs.
But in the field of investment and financial services, the single market
should make a huge difference: capital should move freely across borders;
banks, insurance companies and securities firms should be able to set up and
trade in any member state. Direct competition across borders should flourish
and the consumer - whether professional or private - should enjoy an
unrivalled choice of cheap insurance policies, banking facilities and
brokers' fees, all available by telephone.
But practical, psychological and legislative obstacles remain before this
Utopian vision can be realised.
First the good news. Legislation to establish a single market in banking
services is all but complete. A series of EC measures - including the
cornerstone second banking directive adopted in 1989 - has made it possible
for banks to hold a single 'passport' after 1992.
In essence, this means banks will be able to operate anywhere in the EC,
either through branches in third countries or by offering cross-border
services, from January 1, 1993. Supervision will be carried out by
regulators in the bank's home country.
Forward-thinking banks have already responded to the challenges thrown up by
the single market with a series of cross-border takeovers and alliances, but
the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) -
Luxembourg-based with branches throughout the EC - has made some observers
anxious about the safety of such financial spiders' webs. Brussels is
backing up the initial thrust of its legislation with further measures aimed
at harmonising specific minimum prudential standards throughout the
Community, including directives on supervision and deposit insurance.
The Commission is also working with missionary zeal on a part of the single
market - payment systems - which was almost forgotten in the rush to create
the single passport. The volume of payments across frontiers is likely to
increase substantially from there are few direct cross-border links between
banks, making transfers and settlements time-consuming and unnecessarily
costly. The Commission expects to put pressure on banks to set up a more
efficient system, perhaps with linked automated clearing houses in each
country, by the end of this year. If they fail, Brussels will legislate in
this area too.
Progress has also been swift in the insurance market. From mid-1994,
non-life insurance policies will be available to consumers from companies
anywhere in the EC, and work is under way to reach agreement on the
equivalent legislation opening up the life assurance market. Two more
insurance directives were adopted at the end of last year, which should
ensure the comparability of insurance company accounts across the Community
and setting up a committee to supervise implementation of EC insurance
legislation.
In theory, the benefits to the consumer should be great. According to a
survey by the main European consumers' association earlier this year, fixed
term life assurance can cost eight times as much in Portugal as it does in
the UK. But the same survey also pointed out the practical and psychological
difficulties facing consumers who want to buy across borders. Linguistic
difficulties, lack of information, inconsistent consumer protection rules
and sheer lack of Euro-enthusiasm on the part of some companies were likely
to hamper the project, said the association.
The biggest disappointment for Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner
responsible for financial services, has been in the securities field,
perhaps the area where the single market's largest consumers - investors and
corporate predators - buy and sell.
The investment services directive, which would allow securities firms to
operate anywhere in the Community, has been a priority item on the agenda of
ministers' meetings since June 1990. For three successive EC presidencies -
Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands - high-level working groups have
thrashed out the issues, but never reached agreement.
The British lead a group of countries pressing for more liberal regulation
of stock markets, particularly in the key area of transparency - that is,
the speed and method by which stock market trades are made public. In the
vanguard of the opposing group is France, which would like there to be tight
control over markets.
Recent developments have kept hopes of an agreement alive - just. Having
been bogged down for months, the related capital adequacy directive - which
would establish common capital standards for European securities operations
 -has begun to gain momentum, nudged along by international agreement
between feuding bank and securities regulators in January. Success with
capital adequacy rules could improve the chances of the investment services
directive. Some national officials in Brussels also believe that the British
camp is beginning to break up, which would make a majority compromise
possible.
But to the disgust of advocates of the directive, the UK itself - led by
corporate affairs minister Mr John Redwood - shows no signs of cracking.
Indeed, Mr Redwood indicated in February that the offending measure might be
dropped from the single market programme during the British presidency,
which begins in July, if an acceptable agreement could not be reached.
It is now almost impossible for EC members to harmonise their securities
markets before the 1993 deadline, but in this as in other areas of financial
services evolution will not come to a halt next year. The demise of the
current investment services directive might not greatly upset the City of
London's market-makers, who would be threatened by a French-style regulatory
system. But Commission officials grimly point out that another presidency
and another commissioner could always table a new investment services
directive at a later date - one which might be even less to the UK's liking.

Investment squeeze likely to continue - Peter Marsh discusses economic
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH

<TEXT>
ECONOMIC prospects for Europe this year look far from rosy. Many individual
countries across the continent face a slowdown in domestic activity, while
there is little hope of strong demand pressures from the US and Japan to
help in any upturn.
With the German Bundesbank looking likely to maintain its high interest-rate
policy until well into 1992, the opportunities may be limited for other
countries linked by the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) to reduce
borrowing costs.
That increases the possibility of a further squeeze on investment and demand
in several European countries, particularly Britain, France and Italy, whose
economies are in or near recession.
But the outlook is not totally gloomy. With President George Bush in the US
anxious to put the domestic economy in good shape prior to his effort to
gain a second term in the elections at the end of this year, the US
administration has been exerting pressure on other leading economies to
loosen policy.
America's message has, it appears, found a sympathetic response in Japan,
which like the US has cut official short-term interest rates in recent
months. As for the Bundesbank - which has statutory authority over borrowing
costs in Germany and sets the tone for monetary policy across Europe - its
hard-line view on interest rates is thought likely to soften during 1992.
That would be the case particularly if signs emerge of reduced inflationary
pressures and growth prospects in Germany itself.
Further ahead, Europe has to worry about two pressing issues. The efforts to
integrate into the continent's trading system the fledgling democracies of
what was the east European communist bloc will be an important theme over
the next few years.
Another big subject is the pace of the move towards European economic and
monetary union (Emu), and what this may mean for the individual nations
concerned. A framework for a single European currency, administered by an
all-powerful European central bank and coming into force around the end of
the century, was established by the European Community nations at the
Maastricht summit in December.
But doubts exist about how many EC countries will be able to meet the tough
targets covering government borrowing and inflation which the summit decided
must govern the eligibility of individual countries wishing to enter Emu.
The strong possibility exists that many nations may find the qualification
procedures for Emu too onerous. For example, long periods of high
unemployment might be required in several countries if they are to meet the
rigorous targets requiring a drop in public sector debt levels and lower
inflation matching the German standards of the 1980s.
There is a big question mark over whether public opinion in some countries
could stomach such unpleasant side effects - whatever the supposed longer
term benefits - in which case the general appetite for Emu could fade away.
As for the near term, the half-percentage point increase in German interest
rates at the end of last year sent tremors through the European economy. The
higher German rates attracted more international funds into the D-Mark, the
core ERM currency, forcing all the other ERM nations except Britain to put
up their own borrowing costs to keep their currencies within permitted
fluctuation bands. There has been little sign recently that the Bundesbank
might feel inclined to cut rates soon.
A 6.35 per cent pay rise agreed by German steelworkers early in February is
widely believed to have been above the limit the German central bank thought
appropriate, given its determination to damp down the inflationary pressures
sparked by reunification. The wage increase for the 130,000-strong workforce
may give the green light to other key groups of German workers to seek
similar rises. That, in turn, will probably strengthen the determination of
the Bundesbank to keep rates high, at least over the next few months, in a
bid to force down the pace of wage increases. But given Germany's traditions
as the bastion of low inflation across Europe, the probability of the
central bank's brinkmanship tactics paying off must be reasonably high,
leaving the way open for a reduction in German rates later in the year.
If nothing else, such a turn of events might stop the German economy
plunging into the kind of sharp slowdown which would be most out of keeping
with what has become one of the main engines of world growth. Many
economists are pencilling in growth in Germany this year of about 2 per
cent, following an expansion of some 3.2 per cent in 1991 and 4.5 per cent
the year before. If the Bundesbank keeps up its high rate policy for too
long, the expansion this year could be still more muted.
Any reduction in German rates would be greeted with a sigh of relief by many
business people and politicians across Europe, as it would enable some
monetary relaxation in several other countries. In Britain, a Conservative
government facing an election later this year badly needs to stimulate an
economy that has shown little sign of recovering from the deep recession of
the past 18 months. Many believe UK output will rise by only about 1.5 per
cent this year, after a fall of 2.5 per cent in 1991. It appears that to
help kick-start growth the government may be considering a more expansionary
fiscal policy, for instance a cut in income tax, which may be announced in
the UK Budget.
Like Britain, France would dearly like the opportunity to cut interest
rates. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development expects
French gross domestic product to rise by a sluggish 2.1 per cent in 1992,
after an increase of just 1.4 per cent in 1991. There is a similar pattern
in Italy which faces muted growth of about 2 per cent this year. It also -
like Belgium and Ireland - faces the giant task over the next few years of
cutting down on its mountain of government borrowing if it is to meet the
criteria on public sector debt set for Emu.
As for western Europe as a whole, Oxford Economic Forecasting, a UK
economics consultancy, is moderately hopeful about 1992, projecting overall
growth of 1.9 per cent across the EC nations as against 1.3 per cent in
1991. It is also reasonably bullish about world trade growth this year,
projecting a 5 per cent increase in export volumes by the 24 industrialised
nations in the OECD bloc. If such an increase takes place, it would be a
significant advance in the relatively meagre exports growth by the OECD last
year of just 1.4 per cent.
One good sign for the economy of the industrialised world as a whole is that
inflationary pressures during 1992 are likely to be modest. Many believe
price rises at the consumer level across the bloc will be restricted to just
over 3 per cent in 1992 compared with 1991, roughly 1 percentage point lower
than the change between last year and 1990. That, in turn, could provide a
good basis for sustained growth later in the decade.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of European finance and investment, Overview (1):
Consolidation not expansion - Self-preservation is the watchword for
financial institutions as they count the cost of the recession and brace
themselves for stiffer competition in the European single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE final countdown to the establishment of a single market in the
European community begins, there is a distinct lack of excitement among many
of Europe's financial and investment companies.
Grandiose plans to expand all over Europe are out of fashion. Even the
strongest and most ambitious financial firms - such as Germany's Deutsche
Bank and the UK's Barclays Bank - are consolidating their existing European
networks rather than aggressively acquiring new operations.
Most financial institutions are tending their gardens. Their preoccupation
in the short term is with preserving core domestic operations, which became
over-extended during the late Eighties and are now suffering the ill-effects
of a widespread recession.
In many cases, their capital resources have been depleted by losses and they
need to enhance their profits to rebuild their balance sheets.
Paradoxically, this preoccupation with domestic markets is a response to
proposals for European political and economic integration. Over the coming
years there will be increasing competition between financial institutions
based in different member countries, which will reduce the ability of these
institutions to make near-monopoly profits from exploiting closed domestic
markets. So, companies are doing their utmost to increase the efficiency of
their home operations to withstand this new competition.
Banks, insurance companies and securities companies are all making severe
cuts in their labour forces. Indeed, rival institutions are carrying out
similar cost-cutting plans dreamed up by a handful of international
management consultancies. There is therefore a growing awareness that
cutting costs is not sufficient. It is a zero sum game if every institution
is doing the same.
Long-term competitive advantage will be won by those which succeed in
improving their management and financial controls, which are often crude
compared to industrial companies' controls.
The background to many banks' long-term problems - notably those in the UK
and France - is that for the past few years they have used the big profits
from their retail operations, serving personal customers, to cross-subsidise
other businesses such as securities trading, lending to companies and a
range of overseas operations.
Because these profits were so big, banks were under little pressure to
'unbundle' the range of corporate and personal services they provided, to
measure precisely how much capital was tied up in particular parts of the
business and thus their profitability.
But the magnitude of these cross-subsidies has become apparent in the wake
of big losses recorded by banks in northern Europe on their lending to
companies, notably property companies.
Substantial loan losses on corporate lending have been a feature of recent
results disclosed by UK, French and Scandinavian banks. Many of these banks
would be in serious difficulties without the bedrock of retail banking
profits. One management issue for banks is how to improve controls over
lending, to ensure they do not lend too much to dubious customers. However,
progress in that respect will not be sufficient to guarantee a prosperous
future for banks, since even retail banking profits are now under threat.
They have traditionally earned big profits by investing the interest-free
deposits of personal customers. But over the past few years, banks -
particularly those in the UK - have begun to pay interest on current or
cheque accounts. This has led to an inexorable decline in the profitability
of high street banking, which is likely to affect banks throughout the EC as
legal barriers to competition are removed.
Technological change will reinforce this squeeze on retail profits.
Branchless banking is already established in the UK, in the form of Midland
Bank's First Direct subsidiary. If individuals become accustomed to doing
much of their banking by telephone or using automated teller machines, then
a bank should be able to expand relatively inexpensively, without acquiring
branches.
The bottom line is that an enduring competitive advantage will be won by
banks which succeed in analysing the costs and profitability of the many
different products and services they provide. They could then use their
capital to back only those businesses whose profitability is adequate.
Lloyds Bank in the UK has already demonstrated the benefits of such a
strategy. In the Eighties, it eschewed low margin international lending and
made no significant investment in securities trading, unlike its UK rivals.
As a result, its value on the stock market is greater than all its domestic
rivals other than Barclays, even though its balance sheet is around half the
size of National Westminster Bank's.
In a similar way, Europe's insurance companies are being forced to
concentrate on improving their core underwriting operations and increasing
their efficiency.
Just as banks subsidised lending to commercial customers with profits from
retail operations, so insurance companies have sustained loss-making
commercial risks business - in which they insure the risks of large
companies - with profits from their personal lines business and income from
their investments.
However, in the past five years competition across the board has increased
substantially, depressing premium levels and increasing underwriting losses.
Medium-sized players such as the French mutual companies and newcomers such
as the UK's Direct Line, a Royal Bank of Scotland subsidiary, have undercut
slower moving market leaders by selling direct to the public and reducing
distribution costs.
A number of companies - such as AGF and Axa of France - are already chasing
the business of Europe's biggest companies aggressively. In addition, the
recently agreed EC 'non-life directives' pave the way for much sharper
pan-European competition.
At the same time the downturn in the equity and property markets means
income from investments and realised capital gains has declined. The fall in
asset values has also damaged the industry's traditionally strong balance
sheets.
So, today there is an increased emphasis on calculating the risk on policies
and setting premiums accordingly.
A separate preoccupation of all financial institutions is to ensure the
fairness of EC rules governing pan-European competition. Many securities
firms, for example, are concerned that a forthcoming capital adequacy
directive, laying down conditions on the strength of balance sheets, will
increase costs unnecessarily - and perhaps give an advantage to banks which
carry out securities trading business in competition with pure securities
firms.
Finally, financial institutions are making plans to remodel their businesses
to take advantage of the expected monetary union in Europe. The most obvious
effect of a single European currency on banks would be to deprive them of
some of their lucrative foreign exchange trading business.
A single currency would be accompanied by a single benchmark price for
investment products throughout the EC in the form of a common base lending
rate. This would bolster the trend, already noted, to pan-European
competition in retail banking and insurance services.
So a common theme for the Nineties is emerging. If expansion was the aim of
most financial institutions in the Eighties, self-preservation is the
watchword of today.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Appointments: Piloting LWT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London Weekend Television yesterday appointed its youngest ever executive
director - 29-year-old Neil Canetty-Clarke.
Canetty-Clarke, who came to the London television company from Morgan
Grenfell Securities, has been appointed deputy director of finance of LWT
(Holdings) and director of finance designate. He will succeed Peter McNally,
group finance director, when he retires at 60 in March 1992.
Canetty-Clarke, an Edinburgh University commerce graduate, joined LWT to
work on the company's capital reorganisation. This process could well make
millionaires out of some of the top people at LWT if the share price clears
a certain threshold. The first hurdle towards that has already been cleared
 -retaining the franchise.
Neil Canetty-Clarke is well qualified for the high life at LWT; he has a
private pilot's licence.

Clydesdale Bank, the Glasgow-based subsidiary of National Australia Bank, is
appointing Charles Love, chief executive of TSB Bank Scotland and head of
branch banking for TSB Bank, to succeed its chief executive Richard
Cole-Hamilton when he retires at the end of this year.
Love, who is 46, has spent his entire career with TSB and has been based in
Edinburgh since early 1990. His job there was recently widened to include
all TSB's retail banking operations, which are run from Birmingham.
Cole-Hamilton, 58, said last July that he would retire by the end of this
year and headhunters were appointed to find a successor both externally and
from inside the bank. He has been chief executive since 1982 and presided
over the bank as it was sold by Midland to NAB in 1987.
Love, a Scot who was born near Edinburgh, will join Clydesdale Bank in a few
weeks' time.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's appointment of William Alexander as managing director of Thames
Water Utilities will enable Mike Hoffman, group chief executive of Thames
Water, to concentrate more on developing the non-utility businesses of the
group. Hoffman previously combined both roles.
Expansion away from the core businesses of water supply and sewage disposal,
which are heavily regulated, has been slow but steady at Thames, the biggest
of the 10 former regional water authorities privatised over two years ago.
It now accounts for annual turnover of over Pounds 250m.
Alexander, 45, was formerly technical director of the utilities. He joined
Thames in 1989 from British Coal where he was head of engineering. The
technical division is responsible for Thames Water's investment programme of
Pounds 400m a year as well as research and development and laboratories.
Two group appointments have also been announced at Thames. Bill Harper,
deputy chairman of the utilities company, has been made group director,
corporate activities. He will have special responsibility for the
environment and relations at corporate level. Richard Marshall becomes group
personnel director.
*****
Richard Abraham, formerly finance director of AMI Healthcare, has been
appointed finance director of BUPA HEALTH SERVICES.

FT  26 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in NatWest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY turnover in National Westminster Bank saw the shares jump 24p in early
trading following the bank's well-received results, which included a near 80
per cent drop in profits and provisions for bad debts of Pounds 1.9bn. The
bad news was nearly all expected, and the more positive aspects - including
a maintained dividend - removed any worries over the need for a rights
issue.
The stock's rise was eroded by profit-taking, leaving a net gain of 5 at
308p after turnover of 17m. Traders said the sellers of the stock were those
who had bought at around the 264p level in mid-January; the buyers, even at
yesterday's high of 327p, were institutional investors as the stock remains
a long-term buy on most analysts' lists.
Nomura analyst Mr Mike Fesemeyer has moved to a short-term hold. He said:
'The results were a mixed bag. On the one hand, the bank is starting to get
costs under control, but it is still not getting the returns on equity it
should.' Goldman Sachs also moved to a short-term hold, shaving its pre-tax
forecasts but seeing the bank as 'now moving in the right direction'.
Panmure Gordon remains a buyer, arguing that 'NatWest's potential for
recovery is enormous', and that the worst in terms of provisions is behind
it. The broker is looking for Pounds 755m of pre-tax profits this year, and
Pounds 1.26bn in 1993, while Goldman Sachs is on Pounds 630m and Pounds
1.175bn respectively and Nomura on Pounds 527m and Pounds 1.1bn.
SmithKline volatile
Pharmaceuticals group SmithKline Beecham saw a volatile performance after
announcing profits and a full-year dividend in line with expectations and a
proposal to split its 'A' shares and Units.
The shares drifted in the morning but were marked up as traders responded to
a headline 17 per cent rise in 1991 profits to Pounds 1bn. However, the
gains were eroded by a weak early Wall Street showing and reversed by an
uneasy reaction to the company's meeting with analysts.
At the meeting, the company pointed out that underlying sales for
pharmaceuticals, which constitute around half of its turnover, had only
risen by 1 per cent. There was also concern that overall growth for this
year would be less than the 15 per cent previously expected.
Analysts left to review their forecasts and the 'A' fell to close a net 13
down at 915p, the low for the day, with 3.3m traded. There was also a
feeling that investors may mow begin to switch from the 'A' shares into the
Units, which represent five shares but ultimately will be brought into line
with the 'A' by the split. The Units gained 25 to 4190p.
Unilever setback
Anglo-Dutch conglomerate Unilever finished 30 lower at 938p on
disappointment with the year's results, particularly by US investors.
Unilever fell in early trading as profits of Pounds 1.792bn, against Pounds
1.782bn last year, came in at the lower end of analysts' forecasts. But Mr
Carl Short at Nomura suggested the performance was better than it looked if
a negative currency impact and exceptional items were stripped out. After a
final dividend of 13.91p the total payout rose 4.3 per cent to 18.94p.
The shares rallied as chairman Sir Michael Angus remained cautious about the
outlook for 1992 but described the latest figures as a good solid
performance. A later slide in the share price followed Wall Street's decline
and also reflected a US move out of defensive stocks, such as Unilever, and
into cyclicals.
Leading property shares were depressed as a large seller of Land Securities
moved into the weak market. Land fell 11 to 440p, Hammerson Ordinary 9 to
468p, MEPC 9 to 348p and British Land 5 to 242p.
International shares were hit by the weak early Wall Street performance.
Glaxo was the most heavily traded stock on the New York exchange during the
first few hours of dealing and fell 20 to 793p, Reuters Holdings lost 9 to
1155p and Rothmans International 'B' shed 6 to 1085p. However, Hanson
continued to receive support from a number of analysts' buy recommendations
and held a gain of 2 1/4 at 215p.
BAT Industries was helped by the announcement that it had signed a letter of
intent to negotiate a joint venture with three cigarette factories in the
Ukraine. The shares were firm at 656p.
Turnover in BP was high at 24m shares, with the price firming a penny to
259p. French oil company Elf-Aquitaine announced it had bought BP's refining
and marketing operations in West Africa and Tunisia for an undisclosed sum.
The deal involves 650 service stations in 12 countries. Shell eased 3 to
442p.
Engineering and quarrying business Starmin was the most heavily traded stock
in the London market as a number of large blocks of shares were dealt. A
spokesman for the company said several long-term shareholders no longer
linked with Starmin had decided to off-load their stakes and these were sold
through the market to institutions at 11p a share. A total of 30m shares
went through the Seaq electronic ticker and the price of the stock closed
unchanged at 13 1/2 p.
ECC gained 7 to 528p after it said it expected improved 1991 profits and an
increased final dividend.
Tiphook forged ahead 19 to 364p as County NatWest and SG Warburg reiterated
their positive stances on the stock. Turnover reached 1.7m shares.
Rolls-Royce ended 2 better at 143p as the market continued to expect the
announcement later this week of an engine offer from Cathay Pacific, the
Hong Kong airline.
Bargain hunters and a reiteration by Kleinwort Benson of its positive stance
on Siebe left the shares 7 up at 577p.
Press reports that Ford is to create a chain of fast-fit garages as a rival
to Kwik Fit weakened the latter's shares by 12 to 188p on 3m turnover.
Electronics group Unitech advanced 7 to 208p after an announcement by its
largest shareholder, Electrowatt, of Switzerland. Electrowatt said it was
considering its position after failing to agree terms for a joint takeover
of Unitech with another large shareholder. Turnover reached 1.1m shares as
the market speculated on which interested parties might enter the fray.
Early strength in ICI was eroded by the market's afternoon fall. The shares
climbed 18 initially with the help of a buy note from County NatWest but
closed a net 3 off at 1314p.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi continued to attract attention, the shares slipping 1/2 to
16 3/4 p on heavy turnover of more than 22m shares. US investment groups FMR
Corp and Fidelity International announced that they had between them taken a
3.05 per cent stake (47.8m shares) in the company.
The renewed interest in advertising companies benefited Gold Greenlees
Trott, which picked up 6 to 220p. Publisher Pearson was 3 firmer at 795p
after touching 800p.
Marketing services group Holmes &amp; Marchant slumped 35 to 25p on announcing
that, as a result of difficult trading conditions, it is unlikely to pay a
final dividend.
In a mainly depressed stores sector, Sears put on 2 to 103p on turnover of
4.6m shares. Boots fell 8 to 459p as US credit rating agency Standard &amp;
Poor's lowered its ratings on the company's debt. Northern-based supermarket
group Wm Morrison firmed 2 to 299p, with BZW predicting that the company
'should easily achieve the fastest profits growth out of any superstore
major'. J. Sainsbury continued to benefit from Monday's recommendation by
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, gaining 1 1/2 to 391 1/2 p.
Bass was a firm feature in a generally weak brewing sector. The company's US
exposure pulled the shares down from the day's high, but they still ended 3
ahead at 560p, supported by a joint venture between Bass's subsidiary Coral
Racing and the Tote to promote off-racecourse pool betting.
Grand Metropolitan reversed an early rise to end a penny off at 947p,
following profits downgradings after the annual meeting. Earlier the shares
touched 961p on news of a proposed two-for-one share split.

FT  26 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers in
arbitrage-related trading

<TEXT>
SHARE prices rose slightly yesterday, as denials by a former prime minister
regarding his involvement in an alleged bribery scandal relieved the market,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average recovered 52.31 at 21,025.55, after a day's low of
20,742.53 and high of 21,093.90. Volume picked up to 160m shares from 130m
in trading dominated by arbitrage-related activity.
In spite of the improvement in the Nikkei, declines led advances by 507 to
370 with 210 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
ended 0.85 easier at 1,535.97, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost
0.77 to 1,172.17.
The market focused on the testimony by Mr Zenko Suzuki, the former prime
minister, before the lower house budget committee. Mr Suzuki denied
allegations that he had played an active role in connection with an alleged
bribery scandal involving Kyowa, the bankrupt steel frame builder and
property developer.
The futures market gained strength in the afternoon after the parliamentary
hearing.
Traders said there were lingering hopes of an early cut in the discount
rate. Mr Kozo Watanabe, minister of international trade and industry, called
for a discount rate reduction. 'The market now looks to the Bank of Japan's
quarterly survey of business sentiment,' commented Mr Shigeru Akiba of UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew.
Brokerage stocks fell on reports that securities companies were helping
investors to window dress their accounts by selling loss-carrying
investments to other clients.
The chairman and vice-president of Cosmo Securities, a second-tier brokerage
house, resigned after Cosmo announced an out-of-court settlement with
Skylark, a restaurant chain, which claimed that it had incurred losses due
to Cosmo's trading practices. Cosmo was untraded due to a lack of buyers and
closed at an offered price of Y540, down Y30, and Daiwa Securities fell Y28
to Y970.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y7,000 to Y708,000 on comments by a
finance ministry official in favour of a stock split. An increase in the
stock's liquidity is likely to make it more attractive.
High-technology issues suffered losses on earnings worries. Fujitsu declined
Y6 to Y715 and Matsushita Electric Industrial dipped Y10 to Y1,340. Oki
Electric Industry initially fell after reports that its non-consolidated
pre-tax profit will fall 95 per cent to Y1bn, but late bargain hunting left
the issue a net Y5 up at Y514.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 92.07 to 22,581.90 in volume of 192.5m
shares. Heavy window dressing by companies and financial institutions
wishing to realise profits ahead of the March fiscal year-end pushed up
activity.
Roundup
THE NEW peak for Wall Street lifted some markets in the Pacific Rim. Bombay
was closed for local elections.
HONG KONG was led higher by selected blue chips ahead of results due in the
next couple of weeks. The Hang Seng index closed 44.58 stronger at 4,760.20
in turnover of HKDollars 1.89bn, against HKDollars 1.6bn.
Results of a land auction boosted the property sector. Henderson Land gained
30 cents to HKDollars 16.10 while New World rose 20 cents to HKDollars
14.30.
China Light and Hong Kong Telecom climbed 40 cents to HKDollars 27 and 10
cents to HKDollars 7.95 respectively.
KUALA LUMPUR finished lower on news that a Dollars 3bn law suit had been
lodged in California against Bank Bumiputra. The composite index fell 8.57
to 602.29 in volume of 46.7m shares, against 65.3m.
The law suit action also affected SINGAPORE, where the Straits Times
Industrial index closed 21.47 down at 1,493.27 in turnover of SDollars
140.5m. Jurong Shipyard recorded the biggest loss of the day, falling 50
cents to SDollars 10.30.
BANGKOK eased on profit-taking in the banking sector: the SET index shed
2.83 to 810.45 in turnover of Bt10.4bn. Bangkok Bank dropped Bt36 to Bt740.
SEOUL declined as rising interest rates depressed sentiment. The composite
index ended 5.66 lower at 632.07 in turnover of Won230.6bn.
Goldstar, the electronics company, retreated Won600 to Won14,100 after
reporting disappointing 1991 net profits. Samsung Electronics dipped Won400
to Won32,000 on poor results forecasts.
TAIWAN was pulled down by profit-taking, the weighted index losing 82.51 or
1.6 per cent to 4,987.73 in turnover of TDollars 42.7bn. Analysts said
investors still lacked confidence in the market, although there was no
underlying bad news.
MANILA was boosted by the rise in the US of Philippine Long Distance
Telephone shares. The composite index put on 26.84 to 1,215.15.
AUSTRALIA closed off an earlier high that was spurred by strong domestic
buying of bank, mining and building stocks ahead of yesterday's economic
statement. The All Ordinaries index gained 12.9 at 1,639.8 in turnover of
ADollars 266.5m.
In the banking sector, National Australia advanced 12 cents to ADollars 7.58
and Commonwealth 14 cents to ADollars 7.44.
NEW ZEALAND saw thin volume, but a strong performance in Telecom, which put
on 6 cents to NZDollars 2.42, helped the market to rise. The NZSE-40 index
added 11.89 at 1,501.43 in NZDollars 14m turnover.

<TEXT>
THE SAO Paulo and Rio de Janeiro stock markets were surprisingly firm
yesterday in spite of news that Brazil's negotiations with the Paris Club of
official creditors had run into difficulties.
The Sao Paulo Bovespa index had risen 1.4 per cent by midday in strong
volume of Cr89.8bn (Dollars 61m), recouping a drop recorded on Monday that
was mostly due to profit-taking. The Rio de Janeiro index showed a 0.9 per
cent increase, following a 0.3 per cent rise on Monday.
Both exchanges experienced strong upswings last week, as the government's
export incentive package, indications of a modest decline in the monthly
rate of inflation, and progress in the debt talks all encouraged investors.
The Bovespa index chalked up a 26.7 per cent increase last week, with daily
turnover rising above Cr100bn.
With the emergence of stumbling blocks in the Paris Club talks and the onset
of Carnival, the traditional holiday beginning on Saturday, many traders
expect the market to slow down this week.
'During the Carnival season, things are always lukewarm,' a broker
commented.

FT  26 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Venezuela takes coup attempt in its
stride - High domestic liquidity has helped the Caracas exchange to recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even an attempted coup earlier this month failed to do any lasting damage to
confidence on the Caracas Stock Exchange.
The stock market was closed during the failed military uprising against the
government of President Carlos Andres Perez on February 4. When trading
resumed on February 6, the Caracas Stock Exchange index fell by more than 9
per cent over the next four trading days. But since then the market has
recovered.
The index closed at 34,142 in nominal terms on February 3, a rise of 16.5
per cent from the end of 1991. Some investors - mostly individuals - sold
shares in the wake of the military uprising, but there was no panic. On
February 24, the index closed at 31,378, an increase of 7 per cent since the
end of December.
However, the stock market has not performed so well in dollar terms, notes
Mr Federico Laffan at the London-based Latin American Securities Limited,
because of the fall in the bolivar against the dollar. The index in dollar
terms closed at 548.6 on February 3, a rise of 15.4 per cent since the end
of December, but ended at 480.1 on Monday, just 1 per cent higher than at
the end of 1991.
Mr Laffan says that while the stock market was not ruffled by the failed
coup, the foreign exchange market tells a different story. The bolivar has
fallen to 65.4 against the dollar from 62.2 just before the uprising as
Venezuelans switched into the safety of the dollar or took their funds out
of the country.
The swift crushing of the coup, the first in Venezuela since the early
1960s, has helped maintain confidence in the stock market.
Moreover, the government has pledged to continue its three-year old economic
reform programme, in spite of its broad unpopularity.
Reforms initiated in 1989 produced a sharp decline in economic growth that
year, and had caused a painful fall in living standards. The programme
generated 5.3 per cent GDP growth in 1990 and an expansion of 9.2 per cent
last year, the highest growth rate in Latin America. But the country still
suffers from inflation, which stood at 30.7 per cent last year.
The Caracas Stock Exchange, which rose 34.3 per cent in dollar terms in 1991
after a huge 555 per cent jump in 1990, continues to attract domestic and
foreign attention, especially in the latter case, from emerging market
funds.
Venezuelan investors - both individual and institutional - have been drawn
to the stock market because of high domestic liquidity, caused by falling
rates on certificates of deposit and other fixed income instruments and
lower US interest rates.
Trading this year has been brisk, even though the exchange offers only a
dozen or so active shares. According to Mr Alex Dalmady, president of a
Caracas advisory firm InvestAnalysis: 'Demand for shares has been growing,
but supply has not. Therefore, prices have inevitably climbed to new
heights. Quick profits are feeding the frenzy.'
Mr Dalmady feels that stock prices are high 'by most yardsticks', with
price/earnings multiples for 15 financials averaging 24 and for the 21
industrial stocks 35 at the end of January.
Share supply has increased in one area, however, as industrial companies
place their shares abroad and at home via American Depositary Receipts
(ADRs) or Shares and Global Deposit Shares (GDSs).
Sivensa, the country's largest private steel maker, was the first Venezuelan
company to enter the ADR market, placing its shares in the US in 1991. Since
then other companies - including Corimon, a diversified industrial group,
and Venepal, a paper producer - have also placed shares abroad.
One sign of continuing investor confidence in Venezuelan equities was the
successful international and domestic placing of 2.6m GDSs by Corimon,
during the abortive uprising. Each GDS is worth 25 Class B Corimon shares.
Foreign listings are also likely to increase. Madosa, Venezuela's leading
producer of domestic appliances, last year became the first foreign company
to be listed on the Caracas Exchange.
The exchange, which recently moved into new headquarters, still continues to
be plagued by problems such as back office bottlenecks and lack of
computerised systems. The market remains relatively small, and a trade of
Dollars 500,000 to Dollars 1m can have a strong effect on prices. Trading in
1991 totalled Dollars 2.3bn, up from Dollars 2.1bn in 1990.

in NY depress bourses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SENIOR BOURSES ran into profit-taking yesterday and an early drop on Wall
Street depressed later-closers, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT consolidated after its recent gains. The DAX index closed
1,722.30, down 6.80, while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, eased
0.29 to 701.69. Volume rose to DM7.3bn from DM6.9bn.
Utilities were in the limelight yesterday. RWE opened at the day's high of
DM398.10 on a buy recommendation from Deutsche Bank but a lack of
follow-through buying left the stock down 10 pfg at DM394.20 at the close.
Veba rose DM2.50 to DM374.20 following excellent results from its trading
subsidiary, Raab Karcher. The stock was also lifted by a buy recommendation
from James Capel.
Elsewhere, the supermarket chain Coop rose DM97 to DM2,200 as the trial
against its former management started. Commerzbank, which will list its
shares in Milan on January 30, eased DM1.50 to DM261.50.
PARIS ran into profit-taking after its recent rally. A weak opening on Wall
Street also weighed on the market. The CAC-40 index came off a high of
1,991.70 to close down 22.99 at 1,953.53. Volume fell to FFr2.7bn from
FFr3.6bn.
Cerus, the French holding company of Mr Carlo de Benedetti, remained active,
adding FFr1.60 to FFr136.10 with 681,400 shares traded. Dealers reported
options-related arbitrage activity.
Blue chips which were heavily bought last week fell back, with Michelin down
FFr4.90 to FFr164.90 and Lafarge losing FFr5.10 to FFr351. But Chargeurs
added FFr16 to FFr1,171 in good volume of 22,925.
AMSTERDAM saw active trade in Unilever after it reported 1991 results in
line with expectations. The stock closed down Fl 5.70 or nearly 3 per cent
at Fl 188.40 on late selling by US investors and reports that US consumer
confidence was at its lowest for 17 years. The CBS Tendency Index closed
down 0.4 at 125.8 in turnover of Fl 770m.
Philips, which reports tomorrow, rose Fl 0.10 to Fl 32.50, while Akzo, whose
1991 results are due today, gained Fl 2.20 to Fl 147.70.
MILAN got further encouragement from Monday's inflation data, though some
analysts said this was not the start of a pre-election rally. The Comit
index rose 4.96 to 545.04 in turnover estimated at L115bn after L91.8bn.
Fiat rose by L182 or 3.7 per cent to L5,050, mainly on short-covering.
Pirelli was volatile as traders spotted an arbitrage opportunity between the
ordinary shares and the rights. The rights jumped L33 to L83 while the
ordinaries rose L75 to L1,200.
Ansaldo Trasporti was temporarily suspended after a big buy order pushed the
stock up by its daily limit of 10 per cent. There have been rumours that
Ansaldo will announce a joint venture with Breda in the railway sector.
Trading resumed at the official fixing, at which the stock rose L90 or 2.5
per cent to L3,630.
MADRID opened strongly on news that the central bank had cut the
intervention rate, but fell on a weaker Wall Street. The general index
closed down 0.81 at 259.54. Iberdrola gained Pta5 to Pta748.
STOCKHOLM closed weaker after results from SE Banken failed to lift
sentiment. The Affarsvarlden General Index closed down 4.1 at 927.2 in
turnover of SKr311m. SE Banken, which reported an expected 30 per cent
decline in 1991 profits, rose SKr2 to SKr45.
ZURICH followed Frankfurt lower. The SPI index closed down 2.6 at 1,136.9.
Sulzer rose on reports that it would allow foreign investors to buy its
registered shares as soon as a stake held by Omni Holding, the collapsed
financial company, has been placed. Sulzer certificates rose SFr9 to SFr548.
BRUSSELS closed down on Wall Street. The Bel-20 index declined 3.25 to
1,193.64 in turnover of BFr990m.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Finnish farmers fear the CAP
will not fit - Robert Taylor examines the problems posed by the prospect of
EC membership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Finnish agriculture looks like the only serious obstacle
standing in the way of successful negotiations to take Finland into
membership of the European Community.
Tomorrow the centre-right coalition cabinet is expected to agree on making a
formal entry application and after a debate and vote in Parliament this will
be forwarded to Brussels by the middle of next month.
But Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, as leader of the rurally-based Centre
party is well aware of the deep anxieties among many Finnish farmers,
especially in the north and central areas of the country, who fear they may
lose their livelihoods if Finland adopts the EC's common agricultural
policy. In fact, his Centre party is split badly over the EC issue.
Concern about agriculture is shared by other politicians. President Mauno
Koivisto in his opening address to the new session of parliament nearly a
fortnight ago drew public attention to the need for Finnish farmers to
receive some special treatment if the country joins the EC. 'It is important
for Finland that rural areas remain settled and agriculture viable,' he told
MPs. He added, however: 'Successful pursuit of these ends may be easier in a
European framework than alone with our own resources'.
'We have to make a big reform in agriculture,' admits Mr Pertti Salolainen,
the trade minister and leader of Finland's Conservative party. 'The aim must
be to maintain self-sufficiency but get rid of export subsidies and
surpluses by moving to a lower level of production. However we will need
quite a long transition period in the EC for our agriculture to adapt,
perhaps at least 10 years.'
Finland's still influential Central Union of Agricultural Producers - the
main lobbying force of the farming community - is already campaigning openly
against the idea of the country's EC membership. 'As the backbone of
thriving rural communities agriculture with forestry is a vital part of
Finnish economic life,' explains Mr Heikki Haavisto, the organisation's
chairman.
It must be admitted that only an estimated 8 per cent of the land surface of
Finland is suitable for arable farming and agriculture accounts for only 3.9
per cent of the country's gross domestic product and 7 per cent of the
workforce - about 170,000 out of 2.5m. But the small size of the sector does
not mean that Finns who do not earn their living from the land are ready to
see agriculture sacrificed as the price for EC membership. Indeed, the
farmers are able to tap a strong sense of nationhood that lies deep in the
Finnish psyche. It is no trivial point that the heroes of Finland's winter
war of 1939-1940 against the Soviet Union were rewarded for their bravery
with portions of land.
'The countryside is an essential part of our national identity and cultural
heritage,' asserts Mr Haavisto. In the words of a recent publication from
Finland's agricultural information centre: 'Finnish national character is
based on a close relationship with the surrounding natural environment and
wilds - some might even say we come from the woods. Ancient folklore
embodied a mythical relationship between the earth and the forest. Finns
live on the borderline between east and west, between field and forest'.
The experience of the second world war, when Finland was forced to fight for
its own survival alone, strengthened belief in the need for food
self-sufficiency and parity in development between the incomes of farmers
and wage earners.
In the far northern parts of the country Finland's farming difficulties are
exarcerbated by low temperatures and an annual growing season of only about
175 days. This has helped to ensure that agriculture is well supported
through an elaborate regime of stringent import quotas, even on fruit like
oranges and bananas that cannot grow in Finland, as well as export subsidies
to bridge the gap between world market prices and domestic producer prices.
The expense of all this for the Finnish taxpayer is considerable.
Agricultural support amounts to over 4 per cent of the country's gross
domestic product and subsidies add up to an estimated FM1,500 (Pounds 190)
per head of population. In 1990 the ratio of the producer subsidy equivalent
to the value of agricultural output was 73 per cent, compared with 78 per
cent in Norway and 77 per cent in Switzerland but an average of only 47 per
cent in the EC. At the same time producer prices in Finland are higher than
almost anywhere else in the world and twice the EC average.
Yet farming is hardly a lucrative business in Finland, which is a country of
small farms. The average size is 14 hectares (34 acres) and nearly 60 per
cent have under 10 hectares of arable land. The farmers, whose average age
is 55, eke out a living almost like an endangered species.
'We simply cannot compete with central European agriculture in the
production and sale of milk, meat and cereals,' admits Mr Aho's chief policy
adviser. 'Finland has too many small farmers in the far north producing too
much,' says Mr Haavisto at the agricultural producers association.
In a free market for farm produce like the EC Finnish farmers would find it
hard to survive as food prices in the country would fall dramatically to EC
levels that are only half those in Finland.
'We agree with the principles and objectives laid down in the Treaty of Rome
on agriculture. That is all we want too. We are not asking for anything new
but an agreement where the common agricultural policy can be implemented in
Finland. Every time a new state has joined the EC the policy has been
adjusted,' argues Mr Aho's adviser.
A recent study of the pros and cons of EC membership for the Finnish economy
commissioned by the government pointed out that agriculture ought to benefit
from the EC's regional support policies and that Spain and Portugal were
able to negotiate adjustment periods in their EC entry terms of 10 years.
Finland will be a net contributor of about FM6bn to the EC budget as an
affluent society with a strong industrial and service base. But the
policy-makers are convinced that Brussels will recognise the special needs
of Finnish agriculture. 'The EC may not be life and death for our farmers
but it will bring major structural changes,' admits Mr Aho's adviser.
Whether Finland is in or out of the EC the country's farming is expected to
contract severely in the 1990s, with the number of farms halving over the
next eight years. At the moment EC membership may seem the biggest threat to
Finnish farmers, but the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's
liberalising Uruguay round looks even more alarming. The country's days of
isolationist self-sufficiency are drawing to a close whatever happens.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway to retain lead in North
Sea oil production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY WILL retain its top position as Europe's biggest crude oil producer
throughout the decade with daily average output peaking in 1994 at a rate of
2.5m barrels, according to a report to be released this week by
Edingurgh-based analyst County NatWest WoodMac.
North Sea production of oil and natural gas liquids is forecast by WoodMac
to average a new record level of about 4.31m barrels a day in 1992. This
will be achieved by a revival in UK output to 1.94m b/d this year from 1.76m
in 1991, a 12 per cent production increase by Norway and an 8 per cent
advance by Denmark.
In January Norwegian production of oil and natural gas liquids surged to a
record level of 2.26m b/d from 2.11m b/d in December.
Last year WoodMac forecast correctly that Norway would overtake Britain as
Europe's biggest producer, with daily average production rising by 13 per
cent to 1.95m barrels, contributing 85 per cent of total north west Europe
area production outside the UK. Norway's advance in 1991 was helped by the
country's share of the Statfjord field increasing, partly because of
reallocation of the field and the payback of overliftings by UK partners. In
addition, oil production from the Oseberg field was boosted to a plateau
level of 450,000 b/d when 23,000 b/d was added by two new satellite fields.
Also contributing to the rise was an intensive development drilling
programme in the Gullfaks field. WoodMac expects oil production from
Gullfaks to rise substantially this year to 400,000 b/d. Oil production from
the Hod field was higher than expected in 1991 and will be maintained at
about 28,000 barrels a day, according to the report.

Budapest exchange

<TEXT>
THE THREE-year-old Budapest Commodity Exchange is shaping up as eastern
Europe's best connected market. This week it signed a memorandum of
understanding for co-operation with the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
third largest US futures exchange and the world's largest energy market.
Budapest already has co-operation agreements with the world's largest two
futures exchanges, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
As part of the latest agreement, Budapest must offer Nymex first refusal on
any energy product venture in Hungary where it is seeking another
participant. The Budapest exchange is planning to launch an oil futures
contract in the last quarter of this year. It already trades grain and
livestock contracts, the traditional products of the CBoT and CME,
respectively.
The Nymex-Budapest agreement also encourages the exchange of information and
the strengthening of economic and trade relations.
Mr Lou Guttman, the Nymex chairman, who was in Budapest for the signing
ceremony, said that the New York exchange was 'very excited about the
limitless opportunities which can develop as free market forces take hold in
this area'.
He said Hungary's political stability and relatively advanced economic
reforms made it possible for the BCE to become the leading bourse of its
kind in central Europe.
The Moscow Commodity Exchange has signed similar agreements with Nymex, the
CBoT and the CME, but many believe that economic chaos in the former Soviet
Union will slow the development of budding exchanges in Russia and other
republics.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC denies Canadian fish charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday strongly denied Canadian suggestions that
overfishing by EC vessels outside its 200-mile limit was a major factor in
the severe depletion of its fish stocks, writes David Gardner in Brussels.
Canada on Monday announced a 35 per cent cut in this year's northern cod
quota to 120,000 tonnes, immediately closing the winter fishery for offshore
trawlers inside Canadian waters.
Canadian officials say Spanish and Portuguese vessels last year took 42,000
tonnes of cod from the so-called 2J3KL area of the Northwest Atlantic
Fisheries Organisation. The EC quota, which it sets unilaterally, was 27,000
tonnes, and only 21,500 tonnes were reported to the community, the officials
claim.
They argue that this has a knock-on effect, exacerbating stock depletion
inside Canadian waters and adding to unemployment in Newfoundland. A
Canadian scientific body last week cut its estimate of the spawning stock
from 1.1m tonnes in December to 780,000 tonnes.
Commission officials argue that even if Canada is correct, it is
'outrageous' to suggest that the EC's extra 15,000 tonnes was responsible.
'The cause of the problem in Canadian waters is overfishing by the Canadian
fleet. . . just as the overfishing in Scottish waters is the result of the
overcapacity of the Scottish fleet,' an official said.
He pointed out that Canadian vessels last year netted only 127,000 tonnes of
their 190,000 tonnes quota, so that this week's reduction was less than it
appeared. The community, he added, was willing to accept 'any measures
Canada suggests to control illegal fishing,' and any proportional reductions
in EC quotas - provided the cuts derive from studies carried out jointly by
EC and Canadian scientists.
Officials in Brussels dismiss Canada's veiled threats to extend its waters
unilaterally as an attempt to deflect government unpopularity towards
alleged foreign predators.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India to become rubber exporter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COCHIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA, THE fourth largest producer of natural rubber but traditionally an
importer, is to become an exporter of the commodity this year.
Faced with an unexpected surplus, the government has authorised growers and
traders to export 14,000 tonnes by the end of March. In addition, the State
Trading Corporation has been given permission to export RMA-5 grade rubber
from its stocks. Exports in 1991-92 are expected to total about 20,000
tonnes.
According to Mr K. Ahmedullah, executive director of Harrisons Malayalam,
the country's largest rubber producer, India should find markets for its
rubber in the West as well as in the East. Substantial devaluation of the
Indian currency and liberal export incentives have made rubber exporting a
practical proposition.
The Indian government took a long time to arrive at the export decision as
the rubber consuming industries, particularly the automotive tyre
manufacturers, which have a strong lobby, were opposed to the idea. But as
the rubber prices stubbornly remained below the 'floor' level even after the
price support operation by STC, the only course left open to the government
to shore up prices was to allow exports.
Mr KJ Joseph, secretary of the Association of Planters of Kerala, says a
sharp fall in the demand growth rate for rubber, specially from the tyre
industry, which is facing severe recession, has coincided with a steep rise
in production. The latest forecast is that rubber production in 1991-92
(April-March) will be 375,000 tonnes, compared with 329,615 tonnes last
year, while consumption is expected to rise from 364,310 tonnes to about
375,000 tonnes.
That would imply a perfect match between production and consumption. But, as
Mr Joseph points out, the problem arose with the current season's opening
stock of 86,000 tonnes and the importing of nearly 10,000 tonnes by private
parties under the open general licence.
Without exports, therefore, the next financial year, starting in April,
would open with a stock equal to three months' requirement, which would
inevitably keep rubber prices at distressingly low levels.
The only way the stock can be brought down is through export. But, according
to Mr EB Unni, spokesman for the United Planters' Association of South
India, export alone is not going to be enough to bring supply and demand
into balance. To sustain the interest of growers in rubber plantations, the
minimum price must be above the cost of production, which has risen to
Rs23.66 (48.8p) a kilogram while the minimum price of the RMA-4 benchmark
grade remains at Rs21.44 a kilogram.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum price see-saws amid
catalyst confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLATINUM'S PRICE plunged and then bounced back again yesterday as confusion
reigned in the market about an announcement by Corning, the US group, that
it had developed an automotive catalyst that could meet the tough 1997
emissions standards fixed by California.
Corning said its catalyst used extruded powdered aluminium and ceramics. As
more than 41 per cent of total platinum demand comes from automotive
catalysts, there was some panic selling of the metal in London and on the
New York Commodity Exchange.
This caused platinum to drop by nearly Dollars 4 a troy ounce to Dollars 354
in London at one stage. However, after Corning clarified its announcement
and pointed out that its technology would be added to catalysts using
platinum, the price rebounded to close in London at Dollars 359.50, up
Dollars 1.75 from Monday's close.
Corning's catalyst 'is not a problem for the market,' said Mr Jeremy
Coombes, analyst at Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing
group. 'This technology will enable platinum catalysts to meet the demanding
Californian regulations.'
Analysts in New York suggested platinum there also felt the impact of an
announcement by the Conference Board, an independent economic research
group, showing its US consumer confidence index at the lowest point for 17
years. 'The (US) economy is not expanding and that is what's hurting
platinum, said Mr William O'Neill, senior futures strategist with Merrill
Lynch.

Fresh selling by speculators and trade houses sent London robusta coffee
prices tumbling to fresh 17-year lows. Dealers held out little hope of
recovery in the near term. Robustas from Africa and Asia have plunged by
about Dollars 270 a tonne since the middle of January, basis the second
position, which closed at Dollars 803 a tonne after hitting a low of Dollars
787. New York arabicas were ahead at midday on short covering. On the LME

20,450-tonne rise in LME stocks and rallying strongly to end at seven-month
highs. Dealers said the market hit the day's lows when news emerged that
Russia's Krasnoyarsk aluminium smelter was continuing exports, after threats
earlier this month to gradually shut the plant. An official said the Russian
government had reduced export taxes. Licences for the export of 60,000
tonnes of metal were believed to have been issued. Copper was underpinned by
the labour unrest at Chile's El Teniente mine and the possibility that
disputes could spread to other Codelco facilities. The zinc market was
supported by the force majeure at Peru's Cajamarquilla and caution ahead of
the Big River labour contract expiry.

FT  26 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexico hopes for market
stability - The country's reform of compulsory savings funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican Congress has approved sweeping reforms to the nation's
compulsory pension and housing funds.
The changes are expected to boost domestic savings by Dollars 1bn in the
first year of operation, and in the longer term could make Mexico's
notoriously volatile capital markets more stable.
The new law, which becomes binding in May, requires employers to pay 2 per
cent of employees' salaries into personal pension funds administered by the
commercial banks, and 5 per cent of salary into personal housing funds
administered by a reformed Infonavit, Mexico's housing agency.
The scheme will run alongside the existing pay-as-you-earn social security
system, under which 7 per cent of a worker's salary is paid into a
government-administered scheme.
The reformed pension fund scheme is likely to prove a bonanza for Mexico's
18 commercial banks, 11 of which have just been privatised, with the
remaining seven on the block.
The banks will administer - and receive commissions for - 10m to 12m new
bank accounts as a result of the initiative. Mexico's central bank reckons
the reforms will raise roughly 3bn pesos (Dollars 1bn) in savings in the
first year.
The pension funds will almost certainly be allowed to be partially invested
in both the debt and equity of private sector companies, according to the
Bank of Mexico, although the exact regulations governing the new law have
yet to be worked out.
Since the pension fund managers will be investing over a 30-year period,
they are likely to buy long-term bonds from Mexican companies, says the
bank. Until now, Mexican companies have been forced to borrow over the short
term, partly because of Mexico's high inflation rate, but also due to the
speculative interest of many Mexican investors.
The effect of the reform on the stock market could be equally great.
At present, says Mr Charles Alexander, of N. M. Rothschild, the investment
bank which has a large representative office in Mexico City, there are no
forced buyers of Mexican domestic shares, as institutions in, say, the US
and the UK, are forced to buy their domestic stock.
As a result, says Mr Alexander, it is often difficult to sell Mexican stocks
since there are few investors willing to buy Mexican equity when the Mexican
stock market falls. The lack of long-term institutional buyers also has
exacerbated the volatility of the bourse.
Under the scheme, all workers will be able, if they wish, to invest their
money in the central bank - where the return will be fixed quarterly at an
annual rate of 2 per cent or more in real terms, depending on the finance
minister's interpretation of market conditions.
Alternatively, workers can place their money in an investment fund offered
by their chosen bank - but which could be insurance companies or
stockbrokerages. Investment funds will face restrictions on how much of the
money can be invested in any given asset class, but investments in equities
and corporate bonds will, it appears, be allowed.
Workers can, if they want, top up their savings beyond the 2 per cent of
their salary. At present, most Mexicans do not have bank accounts, so if
they want to save money they often buy consumer durables, such as cars,
televisions or even bricks. Since workers will now be able to channel
savings into the financial sector, Mexico's low savings rate should
increase.
The reforms of Infonavit are just as radical, since they will turn a
construction agency into a housing bank. As in the past, each employer will
pay 5 per cent of workers' salary into Infonavit. But workers will receive
accounts detailing their credits, curbing under-invoicing by companies that
had been common in the past.
Infonavit will charge interest of 4 per cent in real terms to those
borrowing to buy their homes. After deducting expenses, it will pay an
interest rate to creditors that lets the agency break even. Those not
eligible or able to acquire loans from Infonavit - mainly the relatively
well-off - can draw down their credits at Infonavit after retirement.
The reforms have upset Mexico's labour unions, which will no longer be able
to hand out houses to workers, or receive kickbacks for favours rendered.
Likewise, the business sector, while generally supportive of the changes, is
angry it has to pay out another 2 per cent of wages without any increased
productivity. By contrast, the financial sector, which stands to gain the
most, can barely conceal its glee.
The central bank reckons the additional pension savings will increase the
average worker's pension by 25 per cent - although this would only apply to
employees who had subscribed to the scheme through their working life.

FT  26 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: European pension fund assets
'to double'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN Grenfell, the investment banking subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, is
predicting 50 per cent growth in continental European pension fund assets
over the first five years of the current decade, to Dollars 997bn in 1995
from Dollars 675bn in 1990.
Speaking in Frankfurt at Deutsche Bank's headquarters, Mr Michael Dobson,
chief executive of Morgan Grenfell, said the highlight of this expansion
would be diversification of pension funds into non-domestic investments,
where the total under management was likely to double to Dollars 100bn over
the five-year period from Dollars 48bn.
This growth was likely to be higher than anywhere else in the world except
Japan and was likely to fuel demand for the services of Europe-based fund
managers, Mr Dobson said, arguing that the opportunities would be greater
because approximately 10 per cent of all contracts to manage pension funds
are expected to change hands each year.
He predicted that the whole continental European pension fund market would
follow the trend already set by the US and the UK, with a greater emphasis
on active performance and an increasing tendency for pension funds to be
managed by professionals rather than in-house. At present, 80 per cent of
continental European funds are managed by companies themselves and 20 per
cent by independent professionals, almost the opposite of the picture in the
UK.
In continental Europe, 'passive investments' in bonds and private placements
typically constituted around three-quarters of a pension fund portfolio, Mr
Dobson said, with only 10 per cent in equities and the balance in cash and
property. The likelihood was there would be a move towards the typical UK
portfolio, where over 70 per cent is invested in equities.
Mr Rolf Breuer, Deutsche Bank main board director with responsibility for
the bank's securities activities, said it was a priority for the bank to
increase its fund management activities. At present, the bank is the world's
20th largest fund manager with assets of DM124bn under management.
Deutsche Bank is predicting 9.5 per cent growth per year from 1991 to 1996
in the domestic German pension fund market. The total size of German pension
funds stood at only DM129bn in 1991 compared to DM849bn in the UK, DM993bn
in Japan and DM4131bn in the US.
Morgan Grenfell fund managers are paying marketing visits to many of
Deutsche's German corporate clients.

FT  26 FEB 92 / International Equity Issues: Malaysian offering for overseas
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL investors have the first opportunity to participate in a
primary offering of shares in a Malaysian company next month with the
privatisation of Tenaga Nasional, the country's electric power utility.
The Malaysian government is offering 23 per cent of the company for sale,
raising USDollars 1.3bn from the sale of 685m shares. Around 10 per cent of
the shares will be offered to international investors through an open tender
managed by Baring Brothers, Daiwa and Salomon Brothers which starts on March
2.
The deal will be priced this weekend, and bankers are expecting a minimum
tender price of around MDollars 4.50, with shares offered to domestic
investors at a similar price. However, higher bids are expected as
international investors move to secure a stake in an important part of the
country's economy.
At the minimum tender price the company will be valued at around MDollars
13.5bn, against a total equity market capitalisation of MDollars 150bn.
In 1990, Malaysia Telecom was privatised on the domestic equity market,
although last year the government made a Dollars 190m offering of bonds
exchangeable into shares.
Elsewhere, Instituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the Italian banking
group, today starts presentations to international investors in preparation
for its L1,250bn (Dollars 1.04bn) equity offering.
The deal will increase San Paolo's share capital to L6,250bn, making it
Italy's largest banking group. A consortium of banks led by Mediobanca, the
Milan-based merchant bank, are handling the transaction with separate banks
heading regional syndicates.
The deal will be priced on March 9 and the shares are expected to be offered
at around L12,000 to L14,000.

THE Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's
two largest futures markets, begin tests today on a hand-held electronic
trading card, reports Barbara Durr in Chicago.
The two exchanges have spent some Dollars 6m developing Audit, which
promises to help resolve many of the regulatory issues of trading fraud. It
will replace the time-honoured practice of scribbling on paper cards and
create a tamper-proof trail for each trade.
Traders are known to have mixed feelings about the electronic trading device
partly because they fear they will not be able to work as quickly in fast
moving markets.
Although testing was due to begin last year, development delays forced a
postponement. The first prototype, a touchscreen model from Spectrix, will
be tried in the wheat pit of the CBOT and the D-Mark pit of the CME.

FT  26 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Market subdued despite Halifax Pounds
100m addition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW issue activity remained subdued in the international bond market
yesterday, with volatility in domestic bond markets keeping most issuers and
investors on the side-lines.
Halifax Building Society became the second UK financial institution to raise
capital this week, following a Pounds 100m subordinated debt issue by Abbey
National on Monday.
its outstanding Pounds 150m subordinated debt issue maturing 2014. The new
11 per cent bonds were priced to yield 152 basis points over long-dated UK
government bonds, a pick up of around 10 basis points over the outstanding
issue.
This was generous enough to tempt a range of UK institutional investors into
the deal, which was wholly underwritten by Warburg Securities. The deal
becomes the largest unsecured issue at the long end of the sterling market.
There have been few new long-dated bond issues in the sterling market this
year. Most companies have preferred either to defer new issues until UK
interest rates have fallen again or to lock into current rates at shorter
maturities.
As a result, yield spread of outstanding issues have narrowed in the
secondary market. For example, the outstanding Halifax bonds were trading at
a yield spread of 175 basis points over gilts in early December, against 142
basis points before the new paper was issued yesterday.
The proceeds of the issue count as non-core capital for Halifax,
strengthening its balance sheet and increasing its capacity to lend.
However, it does not have an urgent need for capital. Its total capital
ratio is well in excess of 8 per cent of risk weighted assets, the minimum
ratio required under international banking supervision rules, which building
societies will have to meet next year.
By the close of trading, yesterday's issue was trading at 100.875 bid,
having been re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 100.592, where the
yield spread was 147 basis points over gilts.
Elsewhere, new equity-linked bond offerings by Japanese companies continued
to flow. Syndicate officials expect a stream of new deals in the run up to
the Japanese financial year end on March 31.
Six deals were launched in dollars, D-Marks, Ecu and Swiss francs with the
companies raising Dollars 650m equivalent.
Demand is well below the levels seen at the peak of the financial boom in
Japan, although most of the deals launched yesterday received a reasonable
reception.
For example, Nisshinbo Industries' Ecu100m five-year issue, lead managed by
Nikko Europe, traded up from an issue price of par to stand at 100.40 bid by
the close of trading. Autobacs Seven Company's Dollars 100m five-year issue,
lead managed by Nomura International, traded up to 101 bid, also from an
issue price of par.
Nomura Bank International, the arm of the Japanese securities house
recognised under UK banking legislation as a deposit-taking institution, has
been awarded a top A-1+ credit rating for short-term debt by Standard &amp;
Poor's, the US credit rating agency.

public. The deal, valued at about Dollars 237.5m, includes almost every
licensed broker and sub-broker in Thailand.
'We felt it important to have broad participation by the nation's financial
community,' said Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, Thai chairman and the
head of the air force.
He described the offer of 95m shares at Bt60 (Dollars 2.50) each as 'the
largest public offering involving the largest number of underwriters in the
history of the Stock Exchange of Thailand'.
Managing underwriters are Bangkok First Investment and Trust, Dhana Siam
Finance and Securities, Nava Finance and Securities and Thai Investment and
Securities.
In the first such broadly-based offering in Thailand, Thai is offering 40m
shares to small investors through five commercial banks - Bangkok Bank,
Krung Thai Bank, Siam Commercial Bank, Thai Farmers Bank and Thai Military
Bank.
Mr Kaset said the offer, to be promoted by a series of 'roadshows'
throughout Thailand, would allow the public to participate in a large
blue-chip enterprise, mobilise private capital to support Thai's long-term
growth, help the company's image and develop Thailand's capital markets.
Mr Prachitr Yossundara, chairman of Dhana Siam, said the offer would
contribute significantly to share ownership in the country.

FT  26 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Over half swaps cases settled
out of court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than half of all legal disputes between banks and UK local authorities
over interest swap agreements are now believed to have been been settled,
according to banks involved in the transactions.
After a wave of unannounced, out-of-court settlements in recent months, some
authorities are understood to have completely disentangled themselves from
the mass of legal actions, which last summer stood at about 200. Other
authorities and banks hope substantially to have resolved outstanding claims
by the end of this year.
Settlement of the actions would bring to an end the protracted and often
heated dispute between banks and authorities over the swap agreements, under
which banks stand to lose as much as Pounds 500m. A year ago, the House of
Lords in the UK ruled that authorities were acting outside their powers in
entering swap agreements and so could not make payments to banks under the
agreements.
However, banks have continued to push for restitution - the return of
payments they had made under the agreements. These claims are believed to
amount to 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the banks' losses.
Two settlements announced earlier this week, involving Barclays and Midland,
follow many more confidential settlements in recent months, bankers said.
Midland, for instance, said it had settled many of its claims, and had only
11 outstanding. Citicorp, meanwhile, said it had settled more than
three-quarters of claims.
The London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham - the most active of the
authorities in the swaps market - said it had already settled claims with 29
banks.
According to banks involved in the settlements, local authorities are
generally agreeing to repay principal amounts to banks, but are not paying
the full amount of interest claimed on these amounts, which in some cases
are substantial.
The Barclays and Midland settlements bring to an end two cases which had
been singled out by the High Court as test cases. Four others are due in the
weeks ahead, involving Samuel Montagu, Citicorp, Chemical Bank and the
National Bank of North Carolina.
Opinions are divided among banks over whether this week's arrangements will
prompt out-of-court settlements in these cases too, or whether they would
increase pressure on authorities to go to court to get a firm legal ruling
on which they could act.
The outstanding cases will also determine the liabilities of authorities
which entered swap agreements with each other - according to one banker, an
even larger issue than their liabilities to banks.

AYALA Corporation, a leading Philippine property-based conglomerate, plans
to launch a global depository receipt (GDR) programme worth about Dollars
28m.
The company said it will offer 34m class B common shares as GDRs in March.
The GDRs will be offered in Hong Kong, London and New York. Lead
underwriters for the offering are Salomon Brothers and Baring Brothers.
Ayala is the holding company of one of the Philippines' largest
conglomerates, whose interests span property development, food production,
banking and insurance.
In announcing the GDR programme yesterday, Ayala said its unaudited
consolidated net income for 1991 was about 2.1bn pesos (Dollars 87m).
Ayala Land, the property developer in the group and one of the most actively
traded stocks on the local exchanges, sold 96m of its class B common stock
in July 1991, the main portion of which went to the international market.
Its unaudited net income of 800m pesos for 1991 exceeded by about 26m pesos
projections made during its offering period last year.

as airline price war intensifies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TNT, the Australian transport group, yesterday blamed recession and stiff
competition for a net equity accounted loss of ADollars 46m (Dollars 34.50m)
in the six months to December, compared with a profit of ADollars 49m last
time.
The loss increased to ADollars 51m after taking account of abnormal items,
mainly provisions for diminution in the value of non-current assets and
unrealised foreign currency translation adjustments. Equity-accounted
revenue increased 2.5 per cent to ADollars 2.5bn.
TNT said it had been hit by freight transport problems in Australia and
South America, and heavy losses in the domestic airline operations,
jointly-owned with News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's media group.
Analysts had expected a substantially smaller interim loss following a loss
of ADollars 115,000 in the first three months, but the group appears to have
been badly hit by price-cutting in the Australian aviation market.
Ansett Transport Industries, which operates one of Australia's two main
domestic airlines, contributed a loss of ADollars 25.5m after abnormal
items, compared with a loss of ADollars 7.3m in the earlier period. Morael,
which operates the smaller Eastwest Airlines, contributed a net loss of
ADollars 18m, compared with ADollars 5.3m a year earlier.
The group said it expected an improvement in the results of its wholly-owned
businesses if economic conditions improve as expected in its main markets.
However, the directors warned that the aviation businesses would have a
'difficult' third quarter because of continuing uncertainty in Australia.
Price-cutting pressure eased following the collapse of Compass, a small
independent airline, but is likely to increase if Compass or another small
airline returns to the market, as seems likely. The federal government is
also expected to announce today that Qantas and Air New Zealand are to be
given rights to fly on domestic routes in Australia.
On a positive note, the directors said the flotation of 70.4 per cent of TNT
Freightways, the group's US trucking business, had been completed. The
ADollars 400m proceeds of the flotation will enable TNT to further reduce
debt, which fell from ADollars 3.7bn to ADollars 3.5bn during the period.
Interest expense declined from ADollars 110m to ADollars 98m.
The group also said it expected to complete a joint venture arrangement with
five European post offices during the current quarter.
TNT announced recently it has reached agreement with Federal Express, the US
freight carrier, to co-load express freight on daily transatlantic flights.
Both initiatives are expected to help reduce the costs of TNT's European
express freight network.
TNT said the world recession had reduced revenue growth in most of the
countries in which it operates. Revenue was flat in the UK, and lower in
Australia, Canada and South America.

FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: ABSA offer for Bankorp cut to
R1.2bn
</HEADLINE>

   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABSA, South Africa's largest banking group, has lowered its offer for
Bankorp by R100m (Dollars 34.9m) to R1.2bn following a due-diligence
investigation on the latter, writes Philip Gawith.
Last month, ABSA announced it was to take over Bankorp, the fifth largest
bank, in a deal which would make the enlarged ABSA easily the country's
largest, with assets of over R80bn.
Under the revised offer, ABSA will pay 288.5 cents for each Bankorp share,
compared with the original offer of 312.5 cents. The first offer was made
conditional on the outcome of a due-diligence probe.
The R1.2bn purchase will be funded through the issue of 107.55m new shares
in ABSA at R11.25 each, compared with the original offer of 116.5m shares.
Bankorp shareholders will receive 100 ABSA shares for every 390 Bankorp
shares, compared with 360 previously.
In a related transaction, Sankorp announced - also following a due-diligence
investigation - that it would pay 340 cents per Momentum Life share, instead
of the 359 cents originally announced. This deal was precipitated by ABSA's
takeover of Bankorp.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE leading Japanese electronics groups yesterday announced sharp downward
revisions in profit forecasts for the current year ending March.
Matsushita Electric Industrial, Hitachi, and Oki Electric Industry became
the latest companies to issue warnings of lower earnings due to a worsening
market for semiconductors, computers, communication equipment and consumer
electronics products.
The announcements follow the spate of downward earnings revisions by other
large Japanese companies such as NEC and Fujitsu. Sony, the consumer
electronics and entertainment group, said last week its parent company would
post a full-year operating loss for the first time since it was listed on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1958.
Japanese electronics-makers have suffered from falling semiconductor prices,
especially of the 4 megabyte D-Ram chip. Intensifying competition in the
computer market has squeezed profits from the US and European markets.
In Japan, the stock market slump has prompted financial institutions and
brokers to cut back or postpone investments in computer network systems. The
strength of the yen against the dollar has also contributed to the fall in
profits.
Matsushita said consolidated pre-tax profits for the year to March would
fall 43 per cent from a year ago, to Y340bn (Dollars 2.65bn), 26.6 per cent
lower than it forecast three months ago.
Overall sales were revised downward to a 12 per cent rise to Y7,360bn, down
from a 14 per cent increase, and after-tax profits are expected to decline a
year-on-year 49 per cent to Y130bn.
Matsushita said its financial balance sheet would deteriorate due to a
decline in funds for management due to the squeeze on profits. It expected a
foreign exchange loss of Y60bn, and added that depreciation costs for MCA
would total some Y20bn.
The company also released dismal third-quarter results. Consolidated pre-tax
profits fell 32 per cent to Y125bn on a 12 per cent rise in sales to
Y2,005bn. After-tax profits fell 38 per cent to Y52.4bn.
Hitachi, announcing its second downward revision for the current year,
projected a 37 per cent decline in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y355bn.
The company expected sales to remain flat at Y7,700bn.
Oki Electric Industry said it was hard hit by sluggish demand from banks and
securities houses for its information processing equipment, the company's
main product. Oki said a sharp fall in domestic demand had hurt its
profitability.
The company forecasted a 91.1 per cent drop in consolidated pre-tax profits
to Y2bn, on a 1.4 per cent rise in sales to Y670bn. After-tax profits are
expected to plunge 95 per cent to Y500m.

FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Murdoch takes command at Fox
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT MURDOCH is to assume direct management responsibility for Fox, the
Hollywood studio and television network, following the resignation of Mr
Barry Diller, chairman and chief executive since 1984.
The resignation, which Mr Diller insisted was amicable, caught the US
entertainment industry by surprise.
Mr Diller, 50, one of the leading executives in Hollywood, has successfully
built the Fox Television Network, the fourth US national network and one
that boasts hits such as The Simpsons. He has also created Fox Broadcasting,
which delivers five nights of prime-time programming to 131 US television
stations.
Several entertainment industry insiders expressed scepticism about whether
Mr Murdoch - whose News Corporation interests include newspapers, magazines
and publishing as well as film and television - would actually assume a
hands-on role at Fox.
Although Mr Murdoch has made Los Angeles one of his main residences, running
a Hollywood studio is considered by Wall Street analysts an unlikely role
for the Australian-born tycoon.
Although Mr Diller said he and Mr Murdoch had no disagreements, the
departing chairman did say he had told Mr Murdoch of his desire to own an
equity stake in Fox. This was not possible, Mr Diller said, since Fox was
wholly-owned by News Corporation.
Mr Diller said he had yearned 'to have my own company in whatever shape or
size I am comfortable or capable of creating or acquiring'.
Speculation on Wall Street centred on whether Mr Diller might seek to put
together a company to make a bid to acquire NBC Television from General
Electric.
Another possibility raised by analysts was that Mr Diller might join forces
with Mr David Geffen, the record and film industry mogul, to launch a new
venture. Mr Diller described this as speculation, but added: 'David Geffen
is my friend. Who knows?'
News Corporation does not provide detailed figures for Fox, but the group's
last results showed ADollars 124.38m (USDollars 93.5m) of operating income
from television and ADollars 67.7m from filmed entertainment divisions, in
the six-month period to December 31.
Twentieth Century Fox, the film studio, is expected by analysts to earn
operating income of around USDollars 150m in the financial year to June 30,
while forecasts for Fox TV stations call for operating income of around
USDollars 160m in the same period.
The Fox Broadcasting division is expected to earn between USDollars 40m and
USDollars 50m in the financial year to June.

SUNTORY, the Japanese beverage company, yesterday reported a sharp fall in
earnings for the year to December 1991, writes Emiko Terazono.
Suntory said that non-consolidated results had fallen 24.1 per cent from the
previous year to Y10.9bn due to sluggish sales of its wine and beer
divisions and growing costs for funds procurement.
Overall sales edged up 0.5 per cent to Y800.1bn. Beer sales, accounting for
25.9 per cent of the total while distilled liquor represented 52.3 per cent
of overall sales.

SASOL, the South African synthetic fuel and chemicals producer, overcame
depressed market conditions to lift earnings 14.7 per cent to R533.4m
(Dollars 186.4m) in the six months to the end of December.
Turnover dropped slightly, to R3.96bn from R4bn, as a result of generally
lower prices.
Operating income was 11 per cent down, at R868.8m, reflecting depressed
margins, but this was more than compensated for by lower interest and a
lower effective tax rate. Attributable earnings rose by 14.7 per cent to
R533.4m.
Mr Paul Kruger, managing director, said the synthetic fuel division had
managed to offset cost increases, lower product prices and lower refining
margins by substantially increasing production volumes.
The division will account for about 40 per cent of operating profit in the
current year.
Mr Kruger said the production increase resulted from better operating
efficiencies. The impact of the lower international petroleum product prices
was softened by a weaker rand/dollar exchange rate.
The dividend was lifted to 36.5 cents a share from 32.5 cents.

FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: GM's European operations slip 8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NET profit of the European operations of General Motors, the world's
largest vehicle maker, fell last year by 7.9 per cent to Dollars 1.76bn from
a record Dollars 1.92bn in 1990.
Despite the modest decline, GM was probably still the most profitable of the
big six volume car-makers in Europe last year, with a 7 per cent net profit
margin.
The profits of GM's European operations are a stark contrast to the record
losses suffered by the group in the US last year, which totalled Dollars
7.087bn including a Dollars 1.777bn special restructuring provision.
The European profits provided a partial cushion for the US losses, but could
not prevent the group suffering an overall loss of Dollars 4.5bn, the
largest annual loss ever recorded by a US company.
It is understood the net profits of GM Europe's core Opel/Vauxhall car and
light commercial vehicle operations rose marginally last year to a record
Dollars 1.96bn, despite the launch costs for its new generation Astra small
family car, GM's best-selling car in Europe.
The overall GM Europe profit of Dollars 1.76bn contrasts sharply with the
net loss of Dollars 961m announced earlier this month by Ford, its domestic
rival, for its European operations.
While GM's European profits have totalled more than Dollars 1.75bn in each
of the last four years, Ford has suffered a steep decline from a net profit
of Dollars 1.56bn in 1988, to a net loss of Dollars 961m last year.
Ford's European automotive operations accumulated a net loss of Dollars
1.079bn last year, which was partially offset by a net profit of Dollars
118m achieved by its financial services in Europe.
While GM's core Opel/Vauxhall operations achieved a Dollars 1.96bn net
profit in Europe, the group's overall profit in Europe was reduced to
Dollars 1.76bn by several factors including:
Its share of losses at Saab Automobile, the Swedish car-maker where GM holds
a 50 per cent stake and management control.
Saab Automobile had a loss after financial items of SKr2.243bn (Dollars
375m), compared with a loss of SKr3.25bn a year earlier;
The continuing losses suffered by Group Lotus, the specialist UK sports
car-maker and automotive engineering consultant;
Its share of losses at Avis Europe, the car leasing and rental group;
Reduced profits at its GMAC financial services operations, and losses at the
GM Hughes Electronics subsidiary in Europe.
GM's European turnover rose 3.8 per cent to Dollars 25.36bn from Dollars
24.4bn a year earlier, while its workforce in Europe increased slightly to
128,000 from 127,000 in 1990.
Both GM and Ford claimed record sales volumes in western Europe last year.
GM said its Opel/Vauxhall car sales in western Europe (Opel in continental
Europe and Vauxhall in the UK) rose marginally to a record 1.56m from 1.55m
a year earlier. Ford said its western European car sales totalled 1.58m,
some 2 per cent higher than the previous peak set in 1989.
Most importantly, Opel captured a 17.2 per cent share of last year's booming
German market, with sales in Germany of 717,100.
In the UK, Vauxhall's sales fell 23 per cent to 248,704, while its UK market
share was reduced to 15.6 per cent from 16.1 per cent a year earlier.
Overall in western Europe, GM claimed a record car market share for its
Opel/Vauxhall marques of 11.6 per cent marginally higher than the 11.5 per
cent that was achieved a year earlier.
GM is forecasting sales of 700,000 for its new generation Astra range this
year, with combined sales and new orders of 400,000 since its launch in
mid-October last year.

FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Elf acquires BP refining units
in West Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELF Aquitaine, the acquisition-hungry French oil group, has bought British
Petroleum's refining and marketing businesses in West Africa and Tunisia,
boosting its position in the region.
The deal is the latest in the strategy of Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, Elf's
chairman, to increase its downstream activities across the world and to
reduce Elf's former over-dependence on exploration and production. It
includes more than 650 service stations representing 14 per cent of the
regional market and three refineries in Gabon, the Ivory Coast and Senegal.
The service stations are in 12 countries across West Africa.
This reaffirms Elf's plans to 'reinforce its increasing balance between
production and distribution activities'. Elf is not disclosing the price.
Elf has substantial exploration and production interests in Africa: in
Gabon, Angola, Cameroon, Congo, Niger, Nigeria and Tunisia. It is less
strong in marketing there, with 110 service stations in Nigeria,
representing 5 per cent of that country's market, but it has interests in
refineries in six countries in the region.
Elf approached BP, which agreed to sell as part of its policy of focusing on
what it considers to be strategic markets. BP said yesterday it did not see
the West African assets being built into a core business and had agreed to
sell after an approach by Elf.
Elf said the price was not material; analysts have estimated it at between
Pounds 20m (Dollars 34m) and Pounds 30m.
Over the past year, Elf has acquired refineries and service stations in
Britain, Spain and Germany, where in January it bought Minol, the former
East German service station monopoly. It has actively developed its upstream
activities, having bought 48m tonnes of proven reserves last year, which,
with 41m tonnes of discoveries lifted total reserves 13.6 per cent to 475m
tonnes.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRICITE de France (EdF), the power utility which is western Europe's
largest energy exporter, yesterday reported a steep rise in profits.
Net earnings at EdF rose from FFr100m (Dollars 17.8m) in 1990 to FFr1.9bn
last year, before a FFr500m levy collected by its government owner, on
turnover up by 9.6 per cent from FFr156.5bn to FFr171.4bn.
Mr Pierre Delaporte, president, attributed the improvement to a strong rise
in demand for EdF electricity from Britain and Germany, with a steady rise
in French domestic sales. He expected FFr2bn of profits this year.
There was also a fall in debt charges as EdF used its cash flow to reduce
the huge borrowings accumulated during its ambitious nuclear power station
programme of the past 20 years. Nuclear plant accounted for 77 per cent of
EdF output last year, making France the world's most nuclear dependent
country.
Export sales rose by 18 per cent to FFr12bn, representing 53.4bn kilowatt
hours (kWh) out of total output of 406.5 kWh. Within this, British demand
rose by 42 per cent to 16.8bn kWh, seen as a mark of the disorganisation of
its own electricity industry and making it by far EdF's largest export
customer.
EdF has been criticised for having surplus nuclear capacity. But, the
continuing rise in sales should bring demand in line with capacity by 1996,
said Mr Jean Bergougnoux, managing director.
Debts fell by FFr12bn per cent over the year to FFr214bn and should fall
below FFr200bn by the end of 1992, said Mr Delaporte.

SKANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank, reported a
29.8 per cent fall in operating profits to SKr2.32bn (Dollars 393m) for 1991
after heavy credit losses.
If the credit losses were excluded from the results, SEB said it would have
lifted profits by SKr1.625bn to SKr7.86bn.
SEB's rate of return on equity after tax was 7.6 per cent last year, down
from 11.8 per cent in 1990, while earnings per share dropped to SKr4.50 from
SKr7.61. The dividend for series A and C shares is rising to SKr3.35 from
SKr3,30 within the framework of an unchanged dividend cost to the company of
SKr883m.
Credit losses were SKr4.76bn last year, 1.5 per cent of all loans and a 144
per cent increase over the SKr1.95bn of 1990. Year-end unsettled claims were
SKr5.5bn.

A CONSORTIUM made up of Tractebel, the Belgian energy distributor, and
Total, the French integrated oil and gas company, is negotiating to buy a 49
per cent interest in Noverco, the Quebec natural gas distributor, held by
two Quebec government agencies, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The 49 per cent stake has been for sale for over a year. The two Quebec
agencies, the Caisse de Depot, the public pension plan's investment arm, and
Soquip, the provincial energy agency, bought the Noverco block from a Quebec
entrepreneur for almost CDollars 300m (USDollars 272.7m).
Tractebel and Total may seek a full 50 per cent.

FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: StanChart sets up deal with First
Interstate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD Chartered, the UK banking group, and First Interstate Bancorp of
Los Angeles yesterday announced that they are to join forces in three
business areas by merging some of their operations.
No legal entities are involved and there is no payment by either side.
However, some customers, tangible assets, and banking assets will be
transferred to Standard Chartered.
The two sides have signed a letter of intent, but they will carry out due
diligence investigations and obtain regulatory consents before the deal is
finalised.
Mr Christopher Castleman, executive director financial services at Standard
Chartered, said: 'We regard this as being a very interesting enhancement to
areas of our activity which are directly ones we want to grow with some very
good people from First Interstate who will be joining us.'
He said the deal would complement and reinforce Standard Chartered's
existing core businesses and branch network in the Asia Pacific region.
The transfer from First Interstate will not exceed Pounds 600m and is not
expected to have an adverse affect on its capital strength.
Three business are involved in the deal: First Interstate's trade-related
correspondent banking business, which is dominated by the Asia Pacific
region but includes some Mexican business; corporate finance, principally
some structuring of Mexican paper with Exim bank guarantees and securitised
issues in the US; and a foreign exchange and securities sales and trading
derivatives business.
Mr Castleman said that the new businesses would fit well into existing
operations and were totally in line with the bank's strategy.
Mr Edward Carson, chairman and chief executive officer of First Interstate,
said that the businesses had been consistently profitable. The transfer
would allow it to focus on domestic markets.

FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: London Forfaiting rises by 67% to top
Pounds 15m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON Forfaiting Company, the specialist trade finance house, yesterday
reported a 67 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 15.1m in the
1991 year.
The previous year's profit was Pounds 9.05m.
Mr Jack Wilson, chief executive, said the improvement stemmed from
concentrating on the core forfaiting business while withdrawing from areas
such as project finance and Eurobonds.
Forfaiting is the provision of trade finance through fixed rate loans which
are sold at a discount to investors such as banks.
Trading income increased from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 17.3m and net interest
received increased to 4.96m (Pounds 3.69m).
Earnings per share more than doubled to 11.52p (5.71p).
An increased final dividend of 5p is recommended, making a total for the
year of 7.625p (7.25p).
The company said its Middle East operations, based in Cyprus, increased
profits following the ending of the Gulf war.
The Hong Kong office and Italian subsidiary performed well. It has also
established a representative office in New York.

FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Paint sales lift Kalon to Pounds 9.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUMPER last quarter for paint sales to DIY chains helped Kalon Group raise
pre-tax profit by 57 per cent last year, from Pounds 5.87m to Pounds 9.22m.
The group also benefited from the rapid growth of its sundries range,
including paint stripper and adhesives. In the past two years annual sales
have leapt from Pounds 2m to Pounds 10.6m.
Mr Mike Hennessy, managing director, said most of the products were supplied
in-house, so boosting margins.
The improvement showed through at group operating level, where profit rose
by 40 per cent to Pounds 9.18m (Pounds 6.54m) on sales up 13 per cent to
Pounds 98.5m (Pounds 87m).
Interest turned from a Pounds 665,000 charge to a small income as year-end
cash balances grew to Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 3.1m).
Virtually all the profit came from the decorative division, which made
Pounds 10m pre-tax on sales of Pounds 87.3m.
Prices went up by 10 per cent early in the year, with wage and raw material
inflation only 5 per cent.
Volume growth had flowed through especially in the last quarter as DIY
chains to which Kalon supplies own label products mounted aggressive
promotional campaigns.
In retail paint, the market was flat, but Kalon's volume was 18 per cent up
and it claimed its market share improved from 22 to 27 per cent.
This partly reflected the greater proportion of the market - 36 rather than
31 per cent - taken by the stores' own label paint at the expense of branded
products.
Losses were roughly doubled at three small, problematic divisions:
chemicals, industrial coatings and Spain. Between them the deficit was
Pounds 1.12m on turnover of Pounds 11.4m.
Top management has been changed in all three areas and Mr Hennessy said this
was the year for 'resolving' their future.
Earnings per share rose to 5.28p (3.64p). A final dividend of 1.5p makes a
total of 2.2p (1.5p).
COMMENT
With the DIY enthusiast flushed out of hibernation by the aggressive
marketing of B&amp;Q and Texas Homecare, 1991 was the first year of serious
volume growth since Kalon's in-the-red year in 1987. While the group's
market leadership in own-label paint limits the scope for growth there, the
potential remains strong in sundries and the expanding Leyland trade centre
chain; and the resources are clearly available for acquisitions. All this
makes the tiny loss-making divisions look even more incongruous. The crunch
is coming when they must be either disposed of or expanded to a more viable
size. Nevertheless, damage reduction by the new managers should help profits
this year. With the pre-tax figure forecast to reach at least Pounds 11m,
the prospective multiple of 16 is at a deserved premium to the market. But
after a near tripling of the share price in the past 12 months, further
growth will probably be medium term.

FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Mersey Docks at record Pounds 13m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MERSEY Docks and Harbour Company defied recession in 1991 with pre-tax
profits ahead 22 per cent, from Pounds 10.8m to a record Pounds 13.2m.
Turnover advanced 27 per cent to Pounds 69.5m.
The company, which operates the Port of Liverpool, won new business to push
cargo volume up 7 per cent to a new high of nearly 25m tonnes.
Earnings per share fell to 16.98p (17.92p), but only because the company had
to make provision for tax for the first time after using up allowances from
13 years of losses up to 1984. Earnings would otherwise have been 22p. A
proposed final dividend of 4p lifts the year's total by 1p to 6p.
The company, which returned to the dividend list two years ago after the
government had written off more than Pounds 100m of debts incurred in
restructuring, has increased profits by more than 50 per cent since 1989.
Mr Bill Slater, chairman, said that Liverpool was now able to exploit both
its position as Britain's last large west coast port and the improved
infrastructure of northern England and the Midlands when compared with the
overcrowded south-east.
This made it cheaper to use Liverpool for many cargoes because of lower land
haulage costs and easier access. He predicted that competitive pressures
would force closure of 'a major port' in an arc running from East Anglia to
the Solent during the next five years.
He forecast Liverpool's position would improve further as it developed as a
hub for grouped container traffic.
The company had also developed property in its disused docklands on both the
Liverpool and Birkenhead sides of the Mersey, involving a business park and
conversion of old warehouses into luxury apartments that had sold well.
Property assets were revalued on December 31 at Pounds 119.7m, giving rise
to revaluation surplus of Pounds 69m over their previous 1981 book value.
Mr Slater said the government had still not indicated when it might fulfil
its declared intent to sell its 20 per cent stake.

<TEXT>
The administrators of Polly Peck International, the collapsed fruit and
electronics conglomerate, have renewed their efforts to get the Turkish
Cypriot government to open the company's records on the island to them.
Mr Richard Stone of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the administrator
responsible for corporate finance, arrives in the Turkish-held sector of
Cyprus today for talks with Mr Dervis Eroglu, prime minister of the
internationally-unrecognised Turkish Cypriot administration.
It will be the first time that Mr Stone, who has been trying to get Polly
Peck's assets on the island unlocked since November 1990, has met the
Turkish Cypriot leader.
Last year the adminis-trators obtained a High Court order freezing Pounds
23m of assets held by the Turkish Cypriot Central Bank in London on the
grounds that they appeared to have been improperly transferred from the
company.
There is speculation in London that the order could be dropped if the
Turkish Cypriot authorities open up the accounts to the administrators.

FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Size is strength as customers suffer -
NatWest's ability to beat record bad debt charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank demonstrated yesterday when publishing its 1991
results that it is both one of Britain's strongest businesses and one of its
weakest.
Pre-tax profits fell 78 per cent from Pounds 504m to Pounds 110m due to a
bad debt charge of Pounds 1.99bn, which included the biggest losses ever
incurred by a UK bank on its domestic lending.
However, the group was able to remain in profit because of a sharp increase
in income, excluding bad debt charges. The trading surplus rose 20 per cent
to Pounds 2bn, in large part because of a 28 per cent rise in commission
income.
The strength and the weakness are to some extent two sides of the same coin,
stemming from the sheer size of the organisation. NatWest has for years been
the leading lender to small and medium size businesses, which have been hit
particularly hard by the recession. As a result, it could never hope to
escape from the loan losses afflicting all banks.
But the losses were exacerbated by weak management, as Lord Alexander,
chairman, admitted when saying that there had been 'departures from the
principles of sound lending'. The bank lent too much to too many
insubstantial businesses.
Mr Tom Frost, chief executive, highlighted growth in the loan book at the
end of 1988, when seven years of UK economic growth were drawing to a close,
as a particular mistake.
Improvements in the management of most UK banks lagged behind modernisation
of other industries because banks had been protected from competition till a
decade ago.
Even today, their ostensibly special role within the UK economy means that
the Bank of England still gives them protection from the market disciplines
of being vulnerable to a hostile takeover bid or bankruptcy.
However, NatWest's disproportionate economic power, or oligopolistic
position, was also its salvation last year. Most UK companies, open to
intense competition, found it difficult to increase revenues during the
recessionary conditions of the past year.
But Lord Alexander said that NatWest put in place higher tariff levels and,
with the help of new technology, made sure that an increased number of
eligible customers paid their charges.
As a result, UK branch customers, not including the biggest corporate
customers, paid commissions of Pounds 1.33bn last year, 24 per cent higher
than in the previous year.
The underlying strength of the business was what persuaded the board to
maintain its full-year dividend at 17.5p, even though earnings per share
were significantly lower at 3p, against 13p.
The group is having to withdraw Pounds 220m from reserves to meet the Pounds
285m cost of the dividend.
The balance sheet remains strong compared with many of its international
competitors. The ratio of capital to assets, measured on the new
international basis, known as the Basle convergence ratio, is 9.6 per cent,
well above the 8 per cent minimum set by regulators.
The ratio rose during the year, largely because the bank raised Pounds 466m
of new capital through issues of non-cumulative preference shares and
subordinated debt. There was also a fall in risk-weighted assets, or assets
revalued to take account of their inherent riskiness.
This drop in loans and other assets was no accident, according to Mr Derek
Wanless, a director. He said that all executives had been under instructions
to cut the bank's exposure to low yielding assets.
This emphasis on profitability is symptomatic of Lord Alexander's attempts
to enforce a sweeping cultural change, which has involved a series of senior
personnel changes and a reorganisation of the divisional structure.
'We need to become a business, not a (philanthropic) institution,' he said.
NatWest's shareholders will applaud him. Customers paying higher charges may
not.

FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Addison makes Pounds 14.75m call for AGB
Research acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADDISON Consultancy, the market research group, is paying Pounds 14.75m for
the main businesses of AGB Research, part of the collapsed Maxwell private
empire.
The price of the deal was revealed yesterday in a rights issue document
designed to pay for the acquisition which will take Addison from sixth to
top position in UK market research.
Preliminary agreement on the purchase was reached with administrators Arthur
Andersen last month.
Addison, which trades as Taylor Nelson, will raise approximately Pounds
16.3m net from the rights issue which already has the support of more than
53 per cent of its shareholders.
This does not apparently include Lord Hollick's MAI group, which has 24.8
per cent of existing Addison stock. MAI says it intends to sell if the
acquisition is completed.
Addison is forecasting pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 1.2m for 1992
before taking the acquisition and rights issue into account.
Under the issue holders of ordinary shares will be offered new shares at 12p
on a 9-for-4 basis.
Mr Tony Cowling will continue as chief executive of the enlarged group and
Mr Mike Kirkham and Mr Stephan Buck, both senior AGB executives, will join
the Addison board.
The rights issue, which is conditional on shareholders' approval, has been
underwritten by Robert Fleming, the merchant bank.
Mr Cowling said yesterday that the opportunity to acquire AGB represented a
very significant step forward for Addison.
Trading in the shares of the enlarged group is expected to begin on March
13.

FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: SB breaches the Pounds 1bn barrier with 17%
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE BEECHAM, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and consumer products
group, has broken the Pounds 1bn profits barrier for the first time.
Pre-tax profits increased 17 per cent from Pounds 860m to Pounds 1bn for the
year to December 31 1991.
The group's turnover fell 2 per cent from Pounds 4.76bn to Pounds 4.68bn
following disposals, adverse currency effects, and what Mr Robert Bauman,
chief executive, described as 'tough' trading conditions in the US consumer
market.
Nonetheless, overall revenues from continuing operations rose 4 per cent,
while trading profit increased 13 per cent.
Sales performance of established drugs was mixed: Tagamet, the anti-ulcer
product, fell 2 per cent to Pounds 620m; Dyazide fell 11 per cent to Pounds
148m; Amoxil, an antibiotic, increased 9 per cent to Pounds 243m. The
company was forced to offer Pounds 56m discounts in the US.
Among the newer products, Augmentin increased sales by 24 per cent to Pounds
504m and Seroxat, an anti-depressant, gained 10.7 per cent of the UK market
by value.
Clinical laboratories operations increased sales 13 per cent to Pounds 539m
and profits 24 per cent to Pounds 68m.
The animal health business achieved a 4 per cent increase in sales to Pounds
318m and a 9 per cent rise in trading profits to Pounds 63m.
Sales in the US consumer division fell 9 per cent as customers ran down
their stocks.
Mr Hugh Collum, finance director, announced the company wanted to split its
A and B shares on a 2-for-1 basis to increase liquidity and help smaller
shareholders.
The equity unit is also to be divided to comprise one split B share and a
reduced preferred share to make the A shares and the equity unit more easily
comparable.
The changes will be put to shareholders at the annual meeting in May.
Earnings per share increased 17 per cent from 41p to 48p and earnings per
equity unit from 205p to 240p. A quarterly dividend of 4.15p per A ordinary
share, equivalent to 48.49 cents per equity unit is declared.
COMMENT
SmithKline executives spent much of yesterday patting themselves on the back
for completing a highly successful merger in the space of little more than
two years. Their self-congratulations were justified, but the more difficult
task of generating organic growth remains before them. The most pressing
question is whether the new generation of drugs will be able to compensate
for those reaching or having reached the end of their patents. An increase
in pharmaceuticals sales of only 4 per cent is decidedly sedentary compared
with other companies and the outlook in Japan looks more than tricky with
further hefty price-cuts in the pipeline. On the upside, the stock is likely
to be less vulnerable to a move out of pharmaceutical companies into
cyclicals because of its consumer products division. Hoare Govett maintained
its profits forecast of Pounds 1.14bn for 1992.

JD WETHERSPOON, the London pubs operator which yesterday announced first
half pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 432,000 to Pounds 1.01m, is to seek a
Stock Exchange listing towards the end of the year, writes Philip Rawstorne.
It has appointed Kleinwort Benson to float 35 per cent of the company to
raise about Pounds 15m.
Mr Tim Martin, the managing director who founded the company in 1979, said
the flotation would help to accelerate expansion. During the past 13 years,
the company has grown from one free house to an estate of 37 pubs with a
turnover in the six months to January 25 of Pounds 9.6m.
Many of the pubs have been converted from shops and car showrooms. One was
formerly a bank; another was a chapel. They are run on traditional lines,
offering a wide range of real ales and a music-free environment.
All of the pubs offer one beer at 99p a pint compared with the national
average of 134p. The company has invested Pounds 6m in seven new outlets
during the past six months and plans to open another five pubs in the next
two months.

FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Difficult trading hits Sedgwick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIFFICULT trading conditions in the London insurance market were the main
factor in a fall in pre-exceptional profits at Sedgwick Group, the
international insurance broker.
Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 82.4m, compared with Pounds 90.7m before
an exceptional charge of Pounds 21.4m reduced profits to Pounds 69.3m in
1990.
There was a slight rise in operating income to Pounds 621.9m but the
reduction in interest rates resulted in a fall of Pounds 7.2m in investment
income, while adverse movements in exchange rates depressed profits by a
further Pounds 4.1m.
The US subsidiary performed well for a 23 per cent increase in profit
despite depressed insurance rates and a slight fall in operating income.
However, difficulties in the London insurance market depressed profitability
with the results showing a 7 per cent fall to Pounds 43.6m.
A contraction in capacity at the London reinsurance market led to a 5 per
cent fall in income at EW Payne, the reinsurance broking subsidiary.
The fall in profits at the Lloyd's underwriting agent subsidiary's to Pounds
500,000, compared with Pounds 5.2m, reflected the reduction in commission
paid by Names in 1988, when the Lloyd's market produced its first overall
loss for 20 years.
Earnings per share were 12.8p, compared with 10.4p in 1990. A final dividend
of 8p is proposed for an unchanged total of 12p.
COMMENT
Although falling interest rates and the weakness of the dollar are adversely
affecting profitability, the good news from yesterday's results is that
Sedgwick has costs firmly under control. And with more than 36 per cent of
its income generated in the US, the group is well placed to benefit from the
long awaited turnround in insurance rates there. Unfortunately that prospect
is still somewhat distant judging by the pessimistic views yesterday of
Sedgwick's senior executives. Even so with margins in the group's retail
worldwide operations improving and rates in some sectors of the London
market rising strongly, profits should increase after last year's
disappointing outcome. A pre-tax outcome of Pounds 90m is possible, a
result, which on today's closing price of 212p, puts the share on a
prospective p/e of just over 15, a little less than the average for the
sector.

FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Holmes &amp; Marchant shares fall as dividend
is dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLMES &amp; Marchant, the marketing services group, yesterday surprised the
market by announcing it would not be paying a final dividend, just two
months after the directors had forecast a maintained 3.3p payment.
The board said its bankers were reviewing the group's 'current position and
future plans'. Holmes' share price dropped from 60p to 25p.
In December the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.1m for the year
to end-September. Earnings per share were 7.3p and the directors recommended
the maintained dividend. Combined with the interim dividend of 3.3p, the
proposed dividend was only barely covered by earnings.
The dividend cut comes less than a year after a 1-for-3 rights issue to cut
debt accumulated during a string of ambitious acquisitions.
Since the year-end results' announcement clients had reduced or indicated a
reduction in their marketing budgets for 1992 which would hit cashflow, the
group said. Neither was there any sign of recovery.
The group continued to trade within its banking facilities, Mr Emyr Jones,
finance director, said. Its bank had not put any pressure on the company to
cut the dividend, he said. 'We took a tough decision.'

FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: MGN finance director astonishes MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASTONISHED MPs yesterday questioned Mr Lawrence Guest, chairman of the
Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Fund's investments committee, after he
testified that he did not know the ownership of companies in which the
pension fund held stakes.
Mr Guest, who is also MGN's finance director, said he believed his role was
simply to monitor the returns earned by the pension fund's various
investment managers.
The MPs asked him how the fund had come to invest so heavily in entities
related to Mr Robert Maxwell. Mr Guest, whose investments committee kept no
minutes of its decisions, testified that he did not know the extent of the
pension fund's self-investment until November 1991.
Prior to that, he relied on Bishopsgate Investment Management to provide
valuations of what was in the fund and believed that self investment was no
more than 7 to 8 per cent of the fund.
'I made no specific inquiries into who owned those companies,' Mr Guest told
the Select Committee - sparking titters of disbelief from MPs and audience
alike.
By April 1990, the MGN pension fund accounts showed that over 40 per cent of
all investments were concentrated in 20 companies - over half of which had
some connection with Mr Maxwell or his private interests. Mr Guest conceded
that on one occasion at least, he had received a letter from an MGN
pensioner asking about the unusual pattern of investments, but said he did
not pursue the matter.
Other revealing testimony concerned Lord Donoughue, formerly a director of
BIM. According to a letter from Lord Donoughue's solicitor, he was concerned
about stock lending activities in early 1991 because they were done without
his knowledge. The activities had not ceased by July 1991 and Lord Donoughue
asked that the matter be brought to the attention of the trustees - a
request Mr Maxwell rejected. Two weeks later, Lord Donoughue left the employ
of BIM.
But his departure apparently went unheralded and unrecorded, even to pension
fund trustees to whom he had to report.
Mr Ernest Burrington, then managing director of MGN and a trustee of the
pension fund - and currently its chairman - said he noticed in the autumn
that Lord Donoughue hadn't been around in some time. 'I noticed he was
missing,' Mr Burrington testified. 'It was a little like Argentina before
the junta,' he said - adding that he assumed Lord Donoughue had had a
falling out with Mr Maxwell but didn't want to ask about it.
Mr Burrington testified that he had been about to resign from MGN over the
missing funds and a lease arrangement the company had agreed which he felt
was particularly disadvantageous for shareholders. Mr Burrington said he
later learned that Mr Maxwell had borrowed funds against the lease. He said
that he and Mr Maxwell had exchanged views about the matter at an hotel
during the Labour party conference last autumn and he had offered his
resignation.
Meanwhile, a Scottish printer has emerged as the unsung hero of the Maxwell
pensions saga. Mr Harry Templeton, formerly at the Scottish Sunday Mail,
told how he had been fired from the paper after 18 years service because of
his role as a pension fund trustee.
'Mr Maxwell told me I would sit on the board (of Mirror Group Newspapers
Pension Fund trustees) over his dead body,' said Mr Templeton, a Scottish
printer formerly employed by MGN's Scottish Daily Record.
'That's when I began to suspect he was not to be trusted. Because when I got
on, he lived on.'
Mr Templeton said he repeatedly challenged decisions urged by Mr Maxwell,
going so far as to consult a QC over what actions could be taken to prevent
abuses in the investment of pension funds. He said that Mr Maxwell
repeatedly threatened to wind up the fund if trustees questioned the way it
was being operated.
Mr Templeton was sacked for 'gross industrial misconduct' in 1986 and,
except for a six-month stint that year, has not since worked in the
newspaper business. Mr Templeton said he believed he had been blacklisted
because of his role on the pension fund.
Minutes of MGN pension trustee meetings show that Mr Templeton's appointment
was opposed by Mr Maxwell. Mr Templeton testified that of those trustees
appointed by management, none ever voted against Mr Maxwell. 'Some of them
never even spoke,' he said.

FT  26 FEB 92 / ITT changes image as it seeks riches: Rand Araskog talks to
Martin Dickson and Ian Hargreaves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITT, the US company which more than any other has symbolised the now
unfashionable idea of conglomeracy, may be about to pull a dramatic curtain
down on this era. But then again, just maybe it won't.
What is certain is that ITT's board is yet again considering ways to improve
the lacklustre performance of its shares by making the company more
appealing to investors.
And the options passing through the mind of Mr Rand Araskog, chairman for
the past 11 years, include splitting the business into smaller and more
clearly identifiable pieces.
'We want our company to be more exciting to the investment community than it
is,' Mr Araskog said earlier this month shortly before ITT reported a 15 per
cent drop in 1991 income to Dollars 817m (Pounds 466m). He complains that
its stock, just under Dollars 60, is undervalued by the market yet could
trade at Dollars 80 or more 'if we get a little perception change'.
While carefully unspecific about his plans, he makes plain one theoretical
option is to split off the group's financial services operations, dominated
by the ITT Hartford insurance group, from its manufacturing businesses,
which range from automotive and electronic components to pumps, valves and
paper manufacturing.
ITT's Sheraton hotel group 'could easily be a stand-alone company. Its major
competitors - Marriott, Hilton, Trusthouse Forte - are all independent
companies'.
Certainly, financial services and insurance companies tend to attract lowly
market ratings, which has probably helped to hold down ITT's price/earnings
ratio.
And there are several precedents for such a move.
But in the case of ITT any split-up would be the end of an era.
In the 1970s the company came to symbolise the fashion for conglomeracy as
Mr Harold Geneen, chairman, took it on an acquisition spree far beyond its
roots in telecommunications equipment manufacturing.
His battle cry was 'synergy', his weapon the agreed takeover, and for a
while Wall Street loved it.
When Mr Araskog took over as chairman in 1980 he inherited a company which
was unwieldy, unfocused, heavily in debt and, as Fortune magazine said, 'a
museum of the investment and management ideas of the 1960s'.
He spent much of the 1980s sharply reducing its size and improving its
financial shape by selling off dozens of industrial companies and cutting
fat at the remainder - while fighting off a succession of corporate raiders
keen to carve ITT up completely.
His most dramatic move was the much-lauded sale in 1986 of a majority stake
in ITT's core telecommunications business to CGE of France, which merged it
with its own operations to create Alcatel, the world's largest
telecommunications equipment company.
ITT retains a 30 per cent stake in the company and Mr Araskog, also chairman
of Alcatel, says he has resisted pressures to sell the remaining stake
because of the 'excellent cash flow from Alcatel'.
The net result is a slimmer and financially sounder ITT, whose ambition is
to be a market leader in each of its product areas.
In spite of this, the group remains out of favour on Wall Street and among
institutional investors.
This is partly because of the group's lacklustre profits performance over
the past few years, when it has repeatedly failed to reach its declared goal
of a 15 per cent return on shareholders' equity - in spite of a heavy
programme of buying in its own shares.
Admittedly, many of its businesses are cyclical, and have been hit hard by
the US recession. Last year's Gulf war knocked the hotels business sideways
and the Hartford - well regarded for its conservative management and
fast-growing life business - has had to grapple with a general downturn in
the property/casualty sector.
But in spite of these external factors, some analysts question whether all
its businesses are being run as hard as they might, and wonder about its
strategic focus.
Nor was the group's image helped last year by a row with a leading
institutional investor over the size (estimated at up to Dollars 11m) and
percentage increase (100 per cent) of Mr Araskog's pay package when the
group's financial results were so uninspiring.
In response to these pressures, ITT is introducing a new pay incentive
scheme for 500 senior managers, which emphasises options and ties rewards to
ITT's share price performance and the return on equity of its constituent
businesses.
In the past, earnings per share was the prime yardstick.
The change is popular on Wall Street, where analysts argue that ITT's
managers now have a powerful incentive to improve their financial
performance.
'It may be a reason for management to really shake things up this time,'
says Mr Phua Young, of Wall Street's Lehman Brothers.
Mr Araskog, curiously, downplays the potential impact of the scheme.
'I basically believe most people want to do well. They want to work hard.
They want to be a successful company. I think they expect to get paid, but I
don't think handing candy all over the room does any good.'
Nor does he yet seem committed to radical change in ITT's conglomerate
nature; he is torn, not for the first time, between the big strategic move
and a pragmatic, incremental approach to improving financial performance.
On the one hand, he says until now the board has believed the differing
qualities of the group's component parts add up to a strong whole.
On the other, he acknowledges 'there is very little synergy between the
service companies and manufacturing'.
But with the financial flexibility of ITT's strong balance sheet he does
hold out the possibility of a string of new deals, be they acquisitions or
joint ventures.
Just last week, for example, Sheraton agreed to buy or lease eight hotels
from rival Marriott.
Certainly, Mr Araskog showed canny timing with his string of deals in the
mid-1980s, which the 60-year-old chairman eagerly recalls in some detail
when asked to summarise ITT's strategic shifts in the past decade.
But the question which has hung over ITT since the Alcatel deal remains as
central today as five years ago: can Mr Araskog, together with two
lieutenants fighting to succeed him - Mr Travis Engen on the manufacturing
side and Mr Dale Comey at financial services - grow profits as well as his
company's long record in cutting a deal? The answer should emerge over the
next two years as the US recession ends and the new management pay scheme
goes into effect. But the immediate challenge Mr Araskog perceives is to
boost the share price.
The aim, he says, is 'to make the company more identifiable, and if that
means doing things that are a little bit surprising . . . then I'm prepared
to do that'.

FT  26 FEB 92 / ECC launches Pounds 209m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECC Group, the world's largest supplier of china clay, yesterday announced
plans to raise Pounds 209m from a rights issue. The money is to be used by
ECC to redeem Dollars 350m (Pounds 200m) of US auction market preferred
shares (Amps).
The group is the second British company to announce plans to redeem a large
tranche of Amps. The move will increase nervousness in a controversial
sector of the bond market.
Several large UK companies, some of which are heavily borrowed and have
fallen on hard times due to the recession, have issued Amps. The stock has
been classified as equity although the shares have many characteristics of
debt.
Some of the issues made by UK companies during the late 1980s have run into
trouble recently. Ratner, the UK jewellery retailer, last month announced it
was suspending payments of all preference dividends including those on
Dollars 250m of Amps. Previous auctions of Ratner preferred shares in the US
had failed to attract bidders.
Rank Organisation, the UK leisure group, last March redeemed Dollars 200m of
Amps after its US credit rating was downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's.
Mr Andrew Teare, ECC's chief executive, said yesterday there was no danger
of ECC's credit rating being downgraded. Nevertheless general concern about
the Amps market had pushed dividends above the cost of other forms of US
commercial paper.
'The directors have come to the view that auction preference shares are no
longer a satisfactory long-term source of shareholders' funds and that
permanent ordinary share capital is a more secure platform for further
development of the group.'
The company is offering six of its shares, priced at 415p each, for every 25
already held. They also announced that pre-tax profits for the year to the
end of December were estimated to be Pounds 115.4m, more than 50 per cent
higher than the Pounds 73.3m earned in 1990. Excluding exceptional items the
rise was 7.5 per cent.
The group's share price rose 7p to 528p.
It forecast a final dividend for 1991 of 13.4p making a total of 20p for the
year. This compared with an annualised figure of 19.6p for the previous
year. Earnings per share rose from 15.5p to 32.5p.
Directors expected to at least maintain dividends in the current year.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Letter: Too late to avoid problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir DOUGLAS HAGUE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I hope you will allow me, as a believer in the accuracy of historical
records, to clarify my discussion with Sir Terence Burns, reported by Peter
Marsh (Monday Profile, February 24).
The conversation occurred in June 1987 when my argument was this: first, I
believed that the rate of growth of economic activity in the UK was
unsustainably high; second, that this would lead to serious inflation which
could be corrected only by monetary policy.
Sir Terence took the view that since house prices were not rising
significantly all was reasonably well. To this I replied that unless policy
were changed house prices would begin to rise rapidly but that by then it
would be too late to avoid serious problems. Your readers will be able to
judge which of us was nearer the truth.

Sir, You ask (Observer, February 21) why did I wait a month after the
teletext licence bids were submitted before resigning from the ITN board?
The answer is clear - I didn't] I always disagreed with ITN being involved
in a bid for the teletext licence and made that clear several months ago at
the board of ITN. I also made it clear that, if ITN were involved in a bid,
I would not stay on the board.
Once the bid was submitted I quietly resigned. When the board met last week
they decided to announce my resignation, despite my request to be allowed to
go quietly.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Letter: Circle must be squared on monetarist question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir ALAN WALTERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Samuel Brittan derides and condemns all forms of monetarism
expounded by Patrick Minford, Tim Congdon, myself, and presumably all other
British monetarists ('UK monetarist golden age - alas a myth', February 24).
Fair enough. But what I do not understand is how Mr Brittan can square this
contempt for British monetarism with his great enthusiasm for German
monetarism. The Bundesbank announces monetary targets and, as has been amply
demonstrated over the last six months, it adjusts interest rates and open
market operations to bring the money supply into its target band. Is this
not a monetarist policy as practised by the Bundesbank over the last three
and a half decades?
Indeed so great is Mr Brittan's admiration for German monetary policy that,
since 1985, he has urged that, by joining the ERM, Britain should be subject
to German monetarism. One can appreciate the argument that one can trust the
Bundesbank and perhaps the European Central Bank more than the politicians
who controlled British policy. But embracing German monetary policy does
necessarily imply that one accepts the fundamental relationships between
money, incomes and prices, in short monetarism, that underlies and guides
Bundesbank policy.
We would all benefit if Mr Brittan could explain how this circle is squared.

Sir, So far I have seen no one challenge the thought that the defendants in

steal the clients' money. I am sure I cannot be alone in taking exception to
this. What are bonuses, profit-related pay, commissions, promotions and
capital gains (not to mention a Lord of the Universe reputation) if not
'personal gain'? Not so crude as bags of swag, no doubt, but highly

FT  26 FEB 92 / Letter: Engineering job cuts are those Britain cannot afford
to make
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TIM WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, On Wednesday, February 12 1992, British Aerospace announced 2,350
redundancies - 900 in the regional aircraft company and 1,450 in military
aircraft. Redundancies of that amount are always significant, particularly
in Britain's largest manufacturer and exporter. What was even more
significant, however, was that about 70 per cent were managerial and
technical staff, including about 1,000 professional engineers.
The trend in recent redundancy announcements in high-tech manufacturing is
for white-collar job losses to outnumber those of manual workers. While any
job lost is a tragedy for the employee concerned, the type of jobs now being
cut are those which neither the employer nor the national economy can afford
to lose. It was only a short time ago that companies like BAe, Rolls-Royce,
GEC and British Nuclear Fuels were scouring the universities and
polytechnics of Britain, promising bright, long-term careers for engineering
graduates. Now they are sacking them in large numbers.
It is a well-publicised fact that Britain has a shortage of qualified
engineers; it should not be thought, however, that those displaced will
readily find alternative work. Geographical factors, family, lack of
retraining opportunities and, above all, the UK recession, make it extremely
unlikely that other jobs will be available. It is certain that many of the
new unemployed will be sceptical of Britain's engineering future and will
look for other career paths. Some will drift into casual types of work
merely to have an income.
In towns around the manufacturing sites, Britain may be able to boast some
of the best educated and qualified mini-cab drivers who were previously
professional engineers.
One of the latest absurdities to emanate from Michael Howard, Secretary of
State for Employment, is that employees should be required to repay the cost
of training if they move to another employer. What message would he have for
the highly skilled employees of BAe who have sacrificed time and money to
achieve professional qualifications, only to be dumped into the ever larger
pool of the unemployed?
The government believes that random market forces will resolve the problems
but they cannot and will not. We elect governments to manage the economy.
This government stands on the sidelines wringing its hands and reciting
incantations about worldwide recession, recovery just around the corner and
that it would be worse under Labour. How much worse can it get?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms MARGARET EXLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his rush to dismiss Christopher Lorenz's article on Peter Senge
(Management, February 17), Tony Gill misses the point (Letters, February
21).
What matters is not whether 'organisational learning' is the latest fashion,
but whether as an idea it makes a difference. Peter Senge is not only a
purveyor of systems thinking (an old idea). He also offers some fresh and
practical tools for managers.
Not least is the exploration of their own taken-for-granted mental models -
a revolutionary process if done well. Another is the linkage between systems
thinking and organisational learning.
Operations researchers would have had us believe that systems are
self-correcting, but organisations are only self-correcting if managers
intervene and make sure the learning takes place.
Organisational learning is about accessibility of knowledge. Any readers of
Senge's rather heavy book will have found Christopher Lorenz's plain English
guide a welcome contribution.

direction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER ROWBREY-EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is the common misconception - that information technology should
always be a corporate function in its own right - that is responsible for
most of the marital difficulties of business and IT ('Catalogue grows of IT
woes', February 20). Despite its importance, and increasing relevance to
many companies' activities, IT should generally be subordinate to a business
systems function. Such a department - possessing a sound knowledge of the
business, information systems and the capabilities of IT - is best placed to
formulate IT policies and strategies and to direct IT. In this way a
purpose-built bridge can link the business's needs and the use of IT,
instead of the flimsy constructions which IT managers are often forced to
build.
The UK and many other countries have a wealth of good IT specialists.
Without proper direction - and a forum in which their valuable advice and
ideas can be understood and evaluated - in-house computer systems staff will
seldom be able consistently to deliver the goods.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Foreign Affairs: Iraq's gruesome stalemate - The west must
now formulate clearer and more specific objectives in relation to the Gulf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exactly a year ago, Iraqi forces were in headlong retreat from Kuwait.
Operation Desert Sabre - the coalition ground offensive - was in full and
deadly swing: one of the most rapid and overwhelming military victories in
the history of warfare, ancient or modern.
The US-led, UN-authorised coalition unquestionably won the war. But did it
lose the peace? That is a much harder question. Kuwaiti sovereignty was
restored, yet Kuwait today is by all accounts a broken-backed, acutely
xenophobic society, insecure both in its domestic affairs and in relations
with its neighbours.
Apart from the inevitable reprisals against those accused, justly or
otherwise, of collaboration, whole communities of people who lived in Kuwait
for a generation or more - helping to build and run its ultra-modern
infrastructure in return for a very modest share of its enormous oil
revenues - have been forced to leave. The citizenship laws remain as
restrictive as ever, but the ruling family seems reluctant to concede any
real power even to those who qualify as citizens.
Of the new security arrangements in the region, much talked about before,
during and after the war, there is no sign. Kuwait and the other Gulf states
remain dubious about accepting any long-term military presence of their Arab
'allies', nervous about the growing power of Iran, and desperate for
continued protection from western countries which, for their part, are much
happier to sell arms than to envisage any further involvement of their own
forces.
Above all, President Saddam Hussein remains in power, alternating submission
and deception with provocation and truculence, as the UN struggles to get a
hold on his programmes for manufacturing weapons of mass destruction -
programmes which turn out to have been far more advanced and extensive than
was suspected even a year ago.
The war was fought to liberate Kuwait and to 'restore international peace
and security in the area'. The liberation of Iraq from Ba'athist tyranny was
not an official war aim, although US President George Bush did (on February
15 last year) call on the 'Iraqi people to take matters in their own hands
to force Saddam Hussein the dictator to step aside'. In his mind this was a
means, not an end: a less dangerous (for the coalition forces) and less
destructive route to victory than the direct liberation of Kuwait by a
ground offensive.
But the Iraqi people took it the other way round, seeing the coalition's
victory as a route leading to the overthrow of Mr Saddam's regime. They rose
in revolt too late to be useful from Mr Bush's point of view, and their
expectation of his assistance was cruelly disappointed.
I remain convinced that the insurgents could have won last year's civil war
in Iraq if the US and its allies had given them firm support - even without
the allies committing their own ground forces to a new offensive. They could
have been supplied with food and weapons, plenty of which had been captured
from Iraq during the liberation of Kuwait. They could have been given air
cover, particularly against helicopter attacks (as they were, under the
terms of the ceasefire, against fixed-wing aircraft). And the west could
have pledged support for their proclaimed objective of a united but
democratic and pluralist Iraq, bringing their leaders together and cementing
their new-found unity.
That is disputed in the analysis of the Gulf conflict published by the
International Institute of Strategic Studies*. The rebellions, it points
out, were 'spontaneous, disorganised and poorly armed, and were no match for
the fire-power of the troops loyal to the regime. Also, very early on, the
revolts came to be seen as inherently sectarian and secessionist . . .'
That is true, but it begs the question. Western support would have gone far
to correct this impression, especially if endorsed by Egypt, Saudi Arabia
and Turkey. All three of those countries were on record as wanting to see Mr
Saddam overthrown, and the Turkish president, Mr Turgut Ozal, explicitly
called for a democratic regime in Iraq while publicising his contacts with
Iraqi Kurdish leaders.
Such a combination would have helped to convince the Iraqi officer corps,
drawn predominantly from the Sunni Arab minority, both that Mr Saddam was a
loser and that the successor regime would be a moderate one under western
and Arab tutelage, rather than a sectarian Shi'ite one backed exclusively by
Iran.
Why reheat this long-cold meal now? Because, in one form or another, it
still has to be digested. Today in Downing Street the British prime minister
receives Mr Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic party and,
thanks to the western intervention last spring, one of the two de facto
rulers of northern Iraq - an area from which Mr Saddam has withdrawn his
military forces, but which he is now trying to starve into submission. Mr
Barzani will plead for food supplies to be sent in directly, across the
Turkish and Iranian frontiers. He will also ask Britain to send official
observers to witness elections in Kurdistan.
To refuse such requests would be yet another cynical betrayal of the Kurds,
like that which Mr Barzani's father suffered in 1975 when the US acquiesced
in the Algiers agreement between Iraq and Iran, cutting off the aid that had
encouraged the Kurds to fight.** But to grant them would take Britain close
to supporting a separate Kurdish state, unless it is done as part of a
strategy for liberating Iraq as a whole.
For the fact is that the repression in the south has been, if possible, even
more savage than in the north, and in the south there is no 'safe haven'.
There, too, there is an acute shortage of food and medical supplies, with
epidemics rampant and infant mortality rising steeply, not because food and
medicine are embargoed but because Mr Saddam refuses to sell oil to pay for
them on the terms fixed by the UN Security Council.
Western policy towards Iraq has resulted in a gruesome stalemate, of which
the Iraqi people are the main victims. Recognising this, Mr Bush and his
vice-president, Mr Dan Quayle, have recently pledged that Mr Saddam will not
be allowed to remain in power indefinitely, although without explaining how
they intend to remove him. Meanwhile, the Iraqi opposition is again
gathering itself together, and planning to unite at a congress in Vienna at
the end of March. This time, the west must be much clearer and more specific
about its objectives. It should encourage the proclamation not of a separate
Kurdish state, but of a provisional government for the whole of Iraq, and
should supply that government with weapons and air cover so that it can
gradually expand the area denied to Mr Saddam's forces, until at last those
forces turn against him.

<TEXT>
THE HUMBLING of Rolls-Royce, the luxury motor-car maker, should be a
salutary warning to British manufacturers who wish to nestle in cosy,
upmarket niches. After selling through thick and thin to very rich
consumers, largely sheltered from recessions, the Rolls-Royce has become a
cyclical product. The lesson for Rolls-Royce, part of the Vickers
engineering group, is that even if a product is steeped in history, its
manufacturing needs to be grounded in today.
With Mercedes-Benz pouring huge resources into the development of
increasingly sophisticated cars, in the face of a mounting challenge from
Japanese producers, the luxury car market is becoming increasingly
competitive. Rolls-Royce is implementing changes to working practices, but
too late. Vickers is also looking for an international partner to help
launch a new model range.
This is the path trodden by other UK luxury carmakers, such as Aston Martin
and Jaguar, now owned by Ford, and Lotus, owned by General Motors.
Rolls-Royce may survive without a partner, but as a maker of instant
antiques, rather like the Morgan sports car company. It will become part of
the heritage industry.
If manufacturers occupy small, upmarket niches, the technological ground is
likely to slip from beneath their feet. Hotels and restaurants, shops and
theme parks may trade on heritage and a reputation for old-fashioned
service. But manufacturers need more than the smell of leather and a glint
of burled walnut to retain a reputation for luxury. They need to master
modern manufacturing technologies as well.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Anglo-Irish shutters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALBERT REYNOLDS, the new Irish prime minister, said in his first
international interview that he would like to be remembered as 'the man who
opened up the shutters and let in the light'. He has had a tempestuous
start. News of the Irish courts' refusal to allow an abortion for a
14-year-old girl who had been raped reached the world faster than that of
his own inauguration or the latest atrocities in the north.
The case cannot be blamed on the new administration in Dublin. It is a
reminder, however, that if Ireland wants to live in the modern world - and,
in particular, the European Community - the international spotlight will
sometimes burn the skin.
In a development little noticed outside the Republic, the Irish government
negotiated a protocol to the Maastricht Treaty allowing it to maintain its
own anti-abortion laws, without being over-ruled by the European Court.
Since, in Ireland, Maastricht has to be ratified by referendum, all sorts of
troubles could be in store, including a referendum on Europe that becomes a
referendum on abortion.
That kind of problem over 'subsidiarity' in EC decision-making is familiar
enough to the UK government, to which Mr Reynolds pays his first official
visit as prime minister today. Dealing with Europe is not the only problem
they have in common; there is also the question of Northern Ireland. Given
the imminence of a general election, little new can be expected from the
British.
Constitutional change
Mr Reynolds has already stated his readiness to put articles two and three
of the Irish constitution, which claim the right to legislate for the whole
island of Ireland, on the negotiating table. That is not a huge advance on
previous Irish statements, but he has at least suggested it at the beginning
of his period of office and should be encouraged to build on it. In return
the British government should repeat that while it is opposed to the
unification of Ireland against the wishes of the majority of the people in
the north, it is not opposed to unity in principle. Such was the position
laid down in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, which made the frequency and
relative amiability of Anglo-Irish meetings possible.
The 1985 agreement is a flexible document. It can be amended and adapted as
the parties to it wish. Without it, it is doubtful whether relations between
two fellow members of the European Community would be as harmonious as they
are. But it has not proved so far a basis for solving the Ulster question.
Partly that is because some Unionists still challenge it; partly it is
because it has not stemmed the violence, recently at its worst for many
years. Successive political initiatives, like Mr Peter Brooke's, have been
tried and petered out.
Favourable straws
There are one or two mildly favourable straws in the wind. Part of the
Workers' party in the Republic is renouncing revolutionary links. Mr Gerry
Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, talked at the weekend of a political
rather than a military strategy. In the north there is a new movement,
Initiative 92, seeking solutions across the sectarian divide. None of these
moves represents a decisive, or even a genuinely new stride forward. But
they indicate, yet again, that determination in London and Dublin will not
necessarily go unrewarded.
On the eve of a close-run election campaign, the most helpful development in
London would be for the main political parties to state that they will not
buy votes from Ulster MPs in the event of a hung parliament. A fully
bipartisan approach from Labour and the Conservatives remains, sadly, a
distant prospect, but they could at least protect Ulster from the potential
horrors of Westminster power brokering by the unionists.
It is also time for British politicians to acknowledge that Northern Ireland
is too important to be hived off to a secretary of state. At a time of acute
pressure for constitutional change in Scotland, the debate about modes of
devolution is under way in earnest. Ulster has been allowed to get away too
long with claiming that its problems are uniquely intractable.

<TEXT>
HOW WOULD the readers of this newspaper like to have an elephant in their
garden? What would they feel if they had to live off what that garden
produces? To pose the questions is to answer them. Why then should western
'elefriends' expect Africans to tolerate destructive animals that compete
for valuable resources?
The answer is to make elephants economically valuable. Some argue that the
best way is to permit trade in ivory, the issue that will dominate the
12-day triennial conference of the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (Cites), which will start next Monday in Kyoto.
A total ban has been in place since 1989, following a decade in which
Africa's elephant population slumped from 1.2m to 600,000. The ban seems to
have been successful so far in lowering demand and so reducing poaching.
Zimbabwe, along with South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Malawi, even claims
that culling is needed. These countries want a resumption in trade in ivory
and other elephant products, to generate funds for protection and
preservation.
Arrayed against Zimbabwe are the world's conservationists, who fear an end
to the ban will halt the recovery in elephant numbers. Under their pressure,
many governments have decided to support the ban's prolongation.
The practical argument for the ban is that, without it, there would be
confusion in the market, allowing smugglers greater room for their
activities. The practical argument against it is that it does not make
elephants worth preserving, but only makes them less worth killing.
Moreover, unless final demand has been lowered for good, trade will move
underground.
The case for the ban is not overwhelming. It is, in any case, no more than a
small part of the solution. Elephants need to be made worth preserving. One
way, which would not create the risks attendant upon an open trade in ivory,
is to permit trade in other elephant products. Another is tourism.
Yet another is for the rich to pay Africans directly to preserve endangered
animals. Environmentalists argue as if the preservation of loveable
pachyderms is the only moral issue. It is not. Equally important is whether
well-fed westerners should compel poorer people to adopt their values.
Compensation would be better. The amount they are prepared to pay would be a
good indication of how much they care about elephants.
Imperialism is no better for being green. If the rich want to preserve
elephants, they should put their money where their hearts are.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For its fourth revival at the Royal Opera in John Schlesinger's 1980
production - now directed by Richard Gregson, and sponsored by British Steel
 -Offenbach's not-quite-opera has last June's heroines (Sumi Jo, Anne
Howells and Leontina Vaduva), a new Hoffmann and a new evil genius. Between
them they produce enough sparks to keep the production ticking over, but it
isn't easy work.
Jeffrey Tate conducts in faithful style. A finicky critic might wish that
the Antonia-trio had a more passionate undertow, and for the whole Olympia
act less gentility, more unabashed operetta-attack. Sumi Jo's Olympia
rescues that with aplomb:  she plays (and sings, impeccably) the mechanical
doll with deadpan wit, but not one winsome nudge to remind us that she is
really a clever, lovable artist - something which we could hardly miss.
Anne Howells' Venetian courtesan is too artful and knowing for the flaccid
campery of the old production (a transvestite or two, pre-adolescent boys in
nappies strewing petals), and anyhow not one step of the clumsy action looks
believable. She deserves a more upmarket milieu.
William Dudley's cluttered set seems to have defeated even David Hersey's
efforts to light it evocatively. Tate hustled the Barcarolle, as if fed up
with the languid singalong-status it has acquired over the generations, but
Nemesis struck when the offstage chorus made a premature entry with its
final reprise.
In the last act Dr Miracle's low-budget magicking induces no shudders, and
the all-too-solid apparition of Antonia's Mother (Anne-Marie Owens) is a
plain mistake. Though the want of sympathy for Romantic spookery here is a
real drawback, Miss Vaduva's open-throated Antonia - touchingly vulnerable
not only in persona but in pitch - captures the right feyness. Gregory
Yurisich's Doctor is as ripely flamboyant as his other villainous
incarnations, Councillor Lindorf, Coppelius and Dappertutto; there is an apt
touch of the Alexei Sayles in them all, and some international-class
singing.
In other roles Gwynne Howell, Francis Egerton and John Dobson do their
ever-reliable things without stretching themselves much. For the thankless
part of the student Nathanael (Prologue and Epilogue only) the tenor Lynton
Atkinson finds an unexpectedly sharp character, and Jean Rigby again offers
a robust, subtle Nicklaus/'Muse'.
As for Hoffmann himself, the American Jerry Hadley is not only hopelessly
eager and terrier-like, which suits this besotted anti-hero, but vocally
rather elegant in very creditable French.  From April 1 his role will be
taken over by Neil Shicoff, and Yurisich's quadruple-act by Samuel Ramey.

Are you looking forward to another 10 hours of Inspector Morse? He returns
(8.00) for the first of five hefty murder stories. ITV's discovery that they
could hold a huge audience with two-hour slabs of this middlebrow,
inoffensive, beautifully filmed, rather repetitive, deeply English series
has changed attitudes towards scheduling. Time was when the broadcasters
strained to invent ways of keeping us interested by cunningly building one
appealing programme upon another. Now they simply say 'John - another ten
tons of Morse, please'.
Last week Anita Roddick, rarely off the box for months, was on that awful
interview-yourself series. Today she presents The Day The World Changed
(8.00 BBC2), choosing the day Britain's first department store opened.
Earlier, on The Gloria Hunniford Show Without Wogan (7.00 BBC1), the guests
include Mike McShane and Sandi Toksvig, who are in C4's 'Whose Line Is It
Anyway?' currently starring in a West End play, and about to open in a new
TV comedy.
Timewatch shows the first of a two-part programme on Tito (8.10 BBC2).

Taken as it comes, television seems increasingly like a shoddy street market
where profit via popularity is such a dominant consideration that nothing
else is of any real significance. Have you happened across any children's
television recently? It looks like a penny arcade of repetitively violent
American cartoons, interlarded with chat from youthful presenters who
slavishly ape the style and language of the rougher playgrounds, presumably
to gain 'street cred'. Much of adult television looks embarrassingly
similar, being created, judging from appearances, with just one question in
mind: will it be enjoyed by a tired 16-year old full of lager?
The answer, of course, is to do everything in your power not to take
television as it comes, and this is increasingly easy. For years the trouble
was that when you switched on for a programme you really wanted (or just
before switching off, having seen it) you found yourself trapped into
watching some other rubbish, and when that ended you were lured into yet
more nonsense. Today the video recorder allows you to catch just what you
want, and to watch it whenever you like. True, channel controllers seem
determined not to work to their advertised schedules, but provided you allow
five minutes extra at either end you can normally outwit them and tape the
whole of whatever you want.
For a television critic this system often means finding yourself still stuck
in front of the set at 3.00 in the morning. However, it also means that,
over the last 10 days for instance, even though I have been bored by the
banality of so many new comedies, appalled at the cynical way in which the
Sky Sports satellite channel has exploited its exclusive coverage of the
cricket World Cup (providing only three or four minutes of cricket between
commercial breaks) and depressed by ITV's exhumation of Take Your Pick - all
watched off air in real time - I have also been impressed with the standard
of journalism achieved by a wide variety of programmes which I would
probably never have seen had I not arranged to tape them.
Monday brought Coast Of Dreams, the first of a pair of Channel 4
documentaries about the British colonisation of Spain's Costa del Sol.
According to custom and practice such a programme should tear the lid off a
can of worms to reveal the venality of the host community, the naivety of
the expatriates, and the ghastly reality behind the glossy image of a
retirement paradise. There were touches of all that, but Malcolm
Brinkworth's programme was far more subtle and probed deeper. Without a
reporter or even a voice-over he set up a clever comparison between the
expectations of Kevin and Pam Smith, new arrivals who were just opening the
Swan, and the experiences of Mike and Betti Thompson who have learned the
hard way how to serve 186 plates of roast beef and Yorkshire pud at the Bees
Knees. If the second programme, reporting from the Spanish viewpoint, is
half as revealing it will make a superb pair.
On Tuesdays ITV is currently screening Murder Squad, a 'fly on the wall'
documentary series which provides a stark contrast to all those other
accounts of murder on television, where eccentric detectives, obsessed by
opera or modern poetry, solve labyrinthine mysteries on stunningly beautiful
locations. Murder Squad does not show us the 'truth' (it shows us that even
policewomen have their hair done when they know a television camera crew is
arriving) but it gets 170 degrees closer to it than Marple and Morse. These
murders are in council flats, hairdressers and night clubs. The detectives
are ordinary sounding people, characterised by common sense, routine,
weariness and efficiency. The voice-over is intrusively noticeable,
doubtless indicating the old mistake of choosing an actor, but Robert
Fleming's series gets closer to the mucky and mundane realities of the
average murder (judging from experience as a news reporter) than any other
series I have seen.
Last Wednesday Channel 4 began Letters From St Petersburg, a series of
15-minute programmes made by Kevin Sim, who is staying in the city and
sending his material back for sub-titling. Once the most forbidding place to
make programmes, Russia now seems to have been transformed into the most
accommodating. This opening programme showed us a huge old flat, shared by
15 families, with a whole line of gas stoves in the kitchen, and the
inhabitants holding a typically gregarious new year's party. But Sim found
resentful would-be shoppers who looked back to the notorious siege of the
city as the good old days. Russia's real crisis may be still to come.
Wednesday was also the night that BBC2 screened one of those near perfect
programmes which turn up once in a blue moon, Miss Pym's Day Out in the
'Bookmark' slot. Producer James Runcie had the incomparable Patricia
Routledge playing novelist Barbara Pym, and limited his account of her to a
single day in 1977 when she visited London for the Booker Prize ceremony as
one of the shortlisted authors. She lost, of course, but that was virtually
irrelevant. This 50-minute melange of drama and documentary did not evoke
Pym's books by reference, it exemplified her work by embodying her spirit;
no mean trick when you are operating in such a dramatically different medium
from that of the subject artist.
Last week's episode in the BBC2 series about Spain, Fire In The Blood, which
is going out on Thursdays, was not the best so far. The trick of running in
parallel footage of a football match between Basque and Spanish teams and of
the war between Basque separatists and the rest of Spain was effective
enough. But this series, produced by Alan Bookbinder, is using an on-screen
presenter - Ian Gibson - who does not stop short of indicating his opinion
occasionally (invariably politically correct: women good, men bad, and so
on). Yet this is not a full blown opinion piece, so we get neither a solid
personal view nor a conventional objective report. The sheer strength of the
series is proved by the fact that it survives this and still tells us a
tremendous amount about Spain.
Friday's Arena unfolded the story of David Hampton who, having made a living
in New York by passing himself off as Sidney Poitier's son, is now suing for
millions over a Broadway play which he asserts 'stole' his life story.
Producer Debbie Geller piled irony upon irony to create a programme which
told a weird yarn well and was also wonderfully funny. When Hampton's
victims declined to be interviewed she had actors portray them . . . the
very thing over which Hampton is suing. Her greatest success was to
illustrate vividly the celebrity fixation which grips New York and
presumably explains Hampton's success. His lawyer, although a millionaire,
is desperate to succeed as a singer and readily sang (flat) for Geller's
camera.
Each of these programmes was a powerful piece of journalism, and each used a
distinctive technique. On Sunday came Follow The Money on BBC2 which used
yet another: utterly conventional on-screen Hird, interviews with key
participants, archive footage, and so on. The material was scarcely new,
either: Britain's failure to exploit its inventions such as the jet engine,
penicillin and the CAT scanner. However, producer Richard Belfield combined
it all to devastating effect; you came away furious and desperate because he
made it so clear that we cannot blame just the City, or short-termism, or
silly politicians, or unambitious managements, or neglect of R &amp; D, or
shareholder greed - we have to blame all of them.
With the number, variety and quality of factual programmes on television as
impressive as this, it would be absurd to dismiss the medium as having
succumbed wholly to street market values. However, the odds against
happening across those seven programmes by chance, in the course of casual
viewing, must be immense. The only way to be sure of finding what you want,
and not being side-tracked, is to look at the schedules beforehand and then
programme the video recorder . . . oh yes you can, anyone can, it is one
tenth as difficult as driving a car and merely needs a little practice.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Arts: 'Niagara' and 'Summer Lightning' - Glasgow Citizens
Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the enlargement of its Citizens Theatre from a single theatre into a
complex of three, Glasgow now has an abundance of year-round theatre that
probably no other British city save London can match. The three consecutive
evenings that I spent at the end of last week in its three auditoria were
all absorbing, rich ones. Standards of acting, direction, design were high.
Each play, interestingly chosen, proved rewarding. And the trio add up as a
demonstration of both the great range and accomplishment of the Citz.
I reported on Monday on the new second theatre and its production of Craig
Raine's 1953. The new third theatre, an unclaustrophobic black box, seats
the audience (max. 70) on three sides of the action: which concerns Blondin,
the celebrated 19th-century tightrope-walker, and Carlo, the young man he
once carried on his back on his 15th crossing of Niagara Falls. The play,
Niagara (first performed in 1969 in Peru as El cruce sobre el Niagara), is
by Alonso Alegria (1940- ). Carlo first enters Blondin's life as a know-all
young whippersnapper. He has seen Blondin's every crossing of the Falls;
knows which new show-off tricks actually make the crossing easier; is wise
to tricks that no other spectator notices; knows, as a bystander, more about
the science of tightrope-walking than Blondin does as a practitioner.
What burgeons is akin to love. Critic Carlo cannot conceal, though he
forgets to express, his intense admiration for artist Blondin's heroic
achievements; artist Blondin can only feel grateful for the unparalleled
understanding his every act receives from critic Carlo. More than that,
Carlo is in love with Blondin's potential. He even touches on Blondin's
innermost fantasy; he wants him to train himself to walk on air.
When Blondin refuses to try for the impossible ideal of airwalking, it is
his idea to carry Carlo across the falls on his shoulders. But can Blondin
take such a responsibility on himself? Can Carlo? And yet what they are
aiming at is not peril but a state of happiness. In the play's long final
scene, they make the crossing (in white acrobats' tights, Blondin standing
almost motionless on a strip of ultraviolet light, Carlo perched on his
shoulders); and much of what they say is intensely like love-making talk -
calling each other's names first urgently as they near the point of greatest
danger, then ecstatically as they pass it, and then finally, in a wave of
relief as they near safety and Canada, praising each other effusively.
But this is not a gay play. Out attention may be drawn to the resemblance of
this climactic scene to Tristanic passion, but the two characters are
oblivious to it. And the most stimulating and multi-faceted scenes have
already occurred. Alegria does not try to make us either character loveable
or normal; and this is one of his finest feats. The two performances,
discreetly judged, give the play all the right tension. Daniel Illsey,
though at first a little studied, gives Carlo the right fervent
obsessiveness. Robert David MacDonald, who has translated and directed, also
plays Blondin: a nice blend of the practical man and the visionary.
* * *
Meanwhile across the foyer the first theatre - with that handsome
gold-and-black three-tier auditorium that has served the Citz well for years
 -is presenting Summer Lightning, the classic PG Wodehouse novel adapted and
directed by Giles Havergal. The purist could complain that this is not
really a play, that it retains Wodehouse's brilliant narrative descriptions
('it was that gracious hour of a summer afternoon . . . when Nature seemed
to unbutton its waistcoat and put its feet up') and that most of the delight
it gives its viewers is the same delight they would derive from reading the
novel. He could even cavil that the Efficient Baxter has been eliminated and
the plot correspondingly reduced .
Hard of heart, however, would he be who did not often guffaw here. The
device of having characters not only speak their lines in character but also
provide Wodehouse's narrative comments works comic wonders. Siobhan Stanley
does it with especially hilarious dryness. 'Ah]' she sighs as Millicent
Threepwood, then addresses the audience: 'Millicent looked like something
that might have occurred to Ibsen in one of his less frivolous moments.'
Another effective device is having actors play several roles, sometimes
changing costume in full view of the audience. Stephen MacDonald, who excels
at this, on one occasion switches from the grave butler Beach into the
quavering Lord Emsworth in mid-phrase, while being helped out of his
frock-coat and into a tweed jacket.
It is hard to describe the breathtaking prettiness of Helen Blaxendale as
the chorus-girl Sue Brown. She has, as Nicholas Nickleby once told Newman
Noggs, lips and eyes and hair. (Also cheeks, bones, arms . . . ) And she has
just the amount of energetic freshness which makes you want such
chorus-girls to marry into blue blood and do it some good.

<TEXT>
Hydro-Quebec, the big Canadian hydroelectricity producer, has become one of
the first companies in the world to appear before a self-appointed
international water pollution 'tribunal' to defend itself against its
critics, marking a departure in the public relations war of words between
environmental groups and business.
The Canadian company, the world's fifth largest hydroelectricity producer,
voluntarily stood in the 'dock' in Amsterdam last week to defend itself
against charges of breaching laws and causing serious environmental harm in
pursuit of the large-scale James Bay hydroelectric project in northern
Quebec.
Hydro-Quebec, one of the few corporate 'defendants' to appear in 10 separate
cases heard by the Second International Water Tribunal, was brought to court
by the Cree Indians. After a five-hour hearing, the eight-member jury -
composed of environmental lawyers, writers and scientists - recognised that
Hydro-Quebec and the provincial government had entered into a series of
agreements with the Indians but said they doubted whether 'such a contract
adequately reflects the aspirations of the Crees to self-determination and
control over resources'.
In one other case, representatives of PetroEcuador, the Ecuadorian oil
company, also appeared in Amsterdam. This marks a stark contrast to the the
first international water tribunal in Rotterdam in 1983, when none of the
companies cited in complaints about polluting the Rhine was present.
Jacques Finet, Hydro-Quebec's vice-president for Europe, said his appearance
before the tribunal was designed to get the company's point of view across
to European public opinion. 'We are proud of what we do,' he said. 'We have
nothing to hide.' His accusers, who included the Cree's chief Matthew
Coon-Come, were formidable competitors for media attention. They arrived at
a pre-tribunal canal-side press conference in a traditional Indian canoe.

THE ANTCLIZO (NO 2)
Court of Appeal
(Lord Justice Parker, Lord Justice Stocker and Sir John Megaw):
February 18 1992
A CHARTERED vessel which has completed the prior entry procedure at an
Indian port and has been granted free pratique, is 'entered' at Customs
House and can validly give notice of readiness to discharge, though the
inwards entry register is not yet complete.
The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by the Food
Corporation of India, charterers of the Antclizo, from Mr Justice Hirst's
decision (FT, May 17 1991) upholding an arbitration award in favour of the
shipowners, Antclizo Shipping Corporation. A cross appeal by the owners was
dismissed.
LORD JUSTICE PARKER said that under the terms of a charterparty Antclizo
carried a cargo of wheat from the US to India. Discharge was completed at
Bombay on February 10 1974.
Disputes arose between the parties as to despatch, demurrage and balance of
freight. Arbitrators were appointed in 1975. Arbitration took place in 1990.
The arbitrator held that notice of readiness given at Bombay was valid; and
that there was no cause of action for balance of freight until the date of
his award. Mr Justice Hirst upheld his conclusions.
Clause 34 of the charterparty provided that at port of discharge time was to
count from 24 hours after notice of readiness, 'vessel also having been
entered at Customs House and in free pratique'.
By section 30(1) of the Indian Customs Act 1962 the master had to deliver an
import manifest to the proper officer within 24 hours after arrival at a
customs station, or 'before the arrival of the vessel'.
By section 31(1) he was not to permit unloading until an entry inwards order
had been granted by the proper officer. By section 31(2), no entry inwards
order would be given until the import manifest had been delivered.
According to the Indian Excise and Customs procedural manual, the procedure
at Bombay for entry of vessels and goods had three stages.
The first stage, known as 'prior entry' was that prior to arrival the ship's
agents would lodge an import general manifest, and an entry inwards
application, at Customs House.
The customs clerk would give the vessel a serial rotation number and enter
it in the inward entry register. He would exhibit the vessel's name and
serial number on the Customs notice board, with the reference P/E, which
indicated that prior entry procedure had been completed.
He would provide the agents with a certificate that various formalities had
been completed, and that after submission of the store list and crew
property list, the preventive officer might grant entry inwards.
The second stage arose when the vessel had reached inner anchorage or was in
berth, and was ready to discharge.
If a Customs preventive officer was available he would examine the crew's
property and seal the vessel's bonded property store. Unless his suspicions
were aroused he would endorse the certificate 'inwards entry is granted to
this vessel'. Discharge might then lawfully begin.
At stage three the certificate was taken to the import department at Customs
House. If documents were in order the clerk would fill in the blank columns
in the inward entry register. Regulation 15 of the Customs manual provided
that at that stage 'on receipt of the certificate in the import department
the manifest is admitted finally'.
If a boarding officer was not available when a vessel was ready to discharge
at inner anchorage and Customs had given permission to break bulk in
mid-stream, discharging started at once.
On December 29 1973 the owners' agents completed the prior entry procedure
and obtained Customs permission to discharge at inner anchorage, ie to break
bulk in stream.
On December 30 the vessel anchored at the floating light. She was then an
arrived ship. On December 31 she received free pratique by radio, and gave
notice of readiness. She anchored at inner anchorage at 2030 hours.
On January 1, the agents lodged the required documents with Customs at 1630
and the register was then completed.
Some time between 2030 on December 31 and 1630 on January 1, Customs granted
inwards entry.
The question was whether the vessel was 'entered at the Customs House'
within the meaning of clause 34 of the charterparty, on completion of prior
entry.
Mr Hamilton for the charterers argued that since prior entry did not carry
with it an order permitting inwards entry, only final entry would satisfy
clause 34.
That argument had obvious difficulties.
First, if notice of readiness could not be given until final entry and that
did not take place until after inwards entry had been granted and discharge
commenced, it was unlikely that clause 34 was intended to produce the result
contended for. To provide for a 24 hours' notice of readiness to be given
after discharge had already begun, made no sense at all.
Second, the vessel was physically entered at Customs House when prior entry
was completed.
Third, prior entry was important for importers, who would know they could
proceed and arrange for discharge.
There was no binding authority to compel the court to reach a different
conclusion from that of Mr Justice Hirst and the arbitrator.
Accordingly the vessel was entered at Customs House at the time notice of
readiness was given.
The next question was whether the vessel was ready to discharge when notice
of readiness was given.
The charterers contended she was not ready to discharge until granted
inwards entry.
The arbitrator's case stated that there was no reason why immediately the
ship reached inner anchorage and obtained customs approval of documents she
should not have been allowed to discharge in stream at once; and there was
no reason why she should not have received such approval at once.
In The Delian Spirit (1972) 1 QB 103, in which the absence of free pratique
did not prevent the vessel being ready to load, Mr Justice Donaldson said a
vessel was ready to load 'if she is in such a state of physical readiness
that there is nothing to prevent her being made ready at once if required'.
In the present case as the vessel had already been given permission to
discharge at inner anchorage, she could have been required to discharge and
there would have been no material delay. Either the preventive officer would
have been present and granted inwards entry, or if he was not, discharge
would have commenced.
There was a possibility that if a preventive officer became suspicious there
would have been a delay; or that some accident would occur which would
result in delay.
Those possibilities could not affect the validity of notice of readiness. If
they did, no notice of readiness could ever be given.
The case was covered by The Delian Spirit. Notice of readiness was therefore
valid. The charterers' appeal failed.
The owners cross-appealed against the decision that there was no cause of
action for balance of freight until date of award.
Clause 29 of the charterparty provided for 90 per cent freight to be paid
within seven days of signing bills of lading and 'the balance freight will
be paid after completion of discharge and settlement of demurrage/despatch'.
The owners said the arbitrator had awarded interest on demurrage less
despatch as from December 1 1974, and that the cause of action had accrued
by that date.
On the face of the clause the primary obligation to pay did not arise until
net demurrage/despatch due had been agreed or determined. The owners
accepted they could not succeed except on the McKay v Dick principle ((1881)
6 AppCas 251).
For the principle to apply it had to be shown that the charterers' 'wrong'
prevented settlement.
What prevented settlement was the charterers' contention that they were owed
despatch.
To advance a contention ultimately proved wrong was not a 'wrong'.
The cross-appeal also was dismissed. Their Lordships agreed.

Co)

FT  26 FEB 92 / Jobs: Putting personality tests to the test - Adrian Furnham
considers the attractions of the psychological approach to personnel
selection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After 20 years of ostracism and cynicism, personality and ability testing
has become popular, even mandatory, in many organisations.
A recent survey of The Times 1,000 companies indicated that between a
quarter and a third used psychological tests and that the number was
increasing. However, academic psychologists remain highly sceptical about
the predictive validity of any, or all, personality tests, particularly in
the marketplace of work.
A little of this scepticism - even cynicism - has rubbed off on personnel
and human resources directors but many remain eager to buy and apply such
tests to selection and related organisational issues.
It is not difficult to see why businesspeople are attracted to the idea of
testing. Establishing an accurate, fair and sensitive process of selection
and appraisal is far from easy. Everyone has experienced the awkward, or
inadequate, or lazy, or irresponsible, or inefficient colleague whom
somebody selected and nobody can sack.
As a result some use tests specifically to select out, rather than select in
 -to warn about people who may prove problematic, rather than highlight
potential high-flyers.
It is difficult to obtain all relevant information about people, compare
them with others and make judgments on their future success only by
referring to CVs and interviewing them, so it is no surprise that managers
turn to personality tests which are apparently scientific, seem to provide
useful material on a whole range of personality traits and give normative
data for the population as a whole.
On the other hand, there are those who believe that with sufficient
experience and a modicum of common sense they can easily select the right
person. Tests are not for them. They might argue that just as intelligence
tests do not measure intelligence, so personality tests can hardly measure
something as complex, subtle and varied as personality. After all, people
have one thing in common - they are all different; so some feel it offensive
to reduce people to sets of 16 numbers on a computer-generated profile.
In fact as more and more personality tests come on to the market cynics have
had to rehearse their arguments more frequently. Common objections are:
Many of these tests can be faked. People may lie to put themselves in a good
light and achieve high scores but this does not reflect their real
personality.
Some people do not have sufficient self-insight to report on their own
feelings and behaviour. Some cannot, rather than will not, give accurate
answers about themselves.
Tests are unreliable in that all sorts of temporary factors such as anxiety,
boredom, weariness or ill health can lead people to give different answers
on different occasions. Tests, like the psychologists who invent them, are
unstable.
Most importantly, tests are invalid as they do not measure what they purport
to measure and, equally, the scores do not predict performance in business
over time. Many tests have this Achilles heel and are lamentably short of
robust proof of their validity.
Tests might be able to measure all sort of dimensions of behaviour but not
those crucial to the organisation such as trustworthiness and likelihood of
absenteeism. Buying personality tests is like having a set menu; what many
managers want is the a la carte, where they can select what they want.
People have to be sufficiently literate or articulate to do the tests and be
sufficiently familiar with North American jargon. Many organisations believe
their workforce could not do them properly, it would take up too much time
or would cause embarrassment.
There are no good norms, at least for the populations companies want to
test; comparing them with north American samples, mostly white
undergraduates, is dangerously misleading. That is, there are no benchmark
statistics against which to measure employees.
The tests are unfair and biased in favour of the white middle class so white
males tend to do better or show more attractive profiles and so get
selected. Many tests are the product of middle class, middlebrow,
middle-aged, middle Americans and are not appropriate for those from other
groups.
Interpretation of the tests takes skill, insight and experience which may be
too expensive or not available. In the wrong hands, tests are dangerous
because profiles are given inaccurate or too literal interpretations.
Organisations can become consultant dependent, which is a very expensive
addiction.
Freedom of information legislation may mean that candidates can see and
perhaps challenge the scores themselves, their interpretation or the
decisions made on them. This may lead to extreme embarrassment or, worse,
litigation.
As tests of both ability and personality become well known, people could buy
copies and practice so that they know the correct or most desirable answers.
This happens extensively with US ability testing and results could be seen
to have more to do with preparation and practice than actual ability.
These 11 criticisms are frequently heard. In some instances, and considering
some tests, they are more than justified. They make a useful list with which
to confront a testing enthusiast. But old hands know most of the answers and
can provide impressive statistics on norms, reliability and so on. In
addition to answering the criticisms they may also in fact present a strong
case for testing. Examples are:
Tests provide numeric information which means individuals can more easily be
compared on the same criteria. Different questions are asked of different
candidates during interviews and the answers often forgotten. Testing is an
empirical, scientific operation.
With data-based records a person's development can be traced over time. Test
results in an individual's file can actually demonstrate if, and by how
much, the tests were predictive of later work-related behaviour.
Tests give explicit and specific results on temperament and ability rather
than the vague, ambiguous, coded platitudes so often found in references. A
percentage score - provided of course that it is valid - makes for much
clearer thinking about personal characteristics than terms such as
satisfactory, sufficient or high-flyer.
Tests are fair because they eliminate corruption and stop favouritism or old
boy, masonic or Oxbridge networks from self perpetuating. That is, if a
person does not have the ability or a 'dangerous' profile they will not be
chose irrespective of their other 'assets'.
Tests are comprehensive in that they cover all the basic dimensions of
personality and ability from which other behaviour patterns derive. Most,
but not all, tests tap into the agreed three crucial facets of human
personality which are extraversion, stability, tough-mindedness.
Tests are scientific in that they are soundly empirically based on proven
theoretical foundations - that is, they are reliable, valid and able to
discriminate the good from the mediocre and the average from the bad. Many
have a wealth of studies in their support 'proving' that personality/ability
scores relate to occupational behaviour.
As an academic I like to feel impartial, disinterested and fair when
approaching the topic of testing. This desire for balance (or is it
fence-sitting?) leads me to teach two quite difference courses.
One, A Which? Guide to Testing, is for business people and personnel
officers and is aimed at helping to appreciate which are the discerning,
critical and crucial questions to ask of test salesmen. One motive is to
help them choose, or develop for themselves, the best test for their
particular needs.
The other course, Introductory Psychometrics, is an attempt to persuade my
sometimes cynical, critical and capricious students of the benefits (indeed
necessity) of measuring individual differences and, more importantly, how to
do it properly.
Few people from either group come to the topic without a store of strong
opinions in spite of the fact that their knowledge-base of the pitfalls and
advantages is pretty tabula rasa. Perhaps a Which? report with little black
and red boxes showing strengths and weaknesses is exactly what is required.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Management: Aztec acts swiftly as sky falls in - Training on
Trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Judith Rutherford had barely got her coat off before the bad news broke: 'It
was a complete shock, the worst possible start. But it handed us a massive
challenge.'
In December 1990, only one week into the job as chief executive of Aztec,
London's first operational training and enterprise council, Rutherford was
still preparing a strategy to assist economic growth in the London boroughs
of Kingston, Merton and Wandsworth.
Out of a clear blue sky, British Aerospace fired a devastating broadside
into the heart of the local community. The company announced that it was
leaving Kingston, an aircraft town since 1912 when pioneer aviator Tommy
Sopwith built his prototype 'Camel' there. Generations of Hurricanes,
Hunters, Hawks and Harriers were to follow, until the age of defence cuts
arrived.
The company, which at the time of the announcement directly employed more
than 3,000 people locally in its military aircraft operations and accounted
for one third of local manufacturing jobs, will be gone by the end of this
year. The last Harrier airframe left the factory this month.
With it went around 500 job opportunities a year, numerous skill training
opportunities, more than Pounds 12m of spending power from local people's
pockets and all hopes that the area could avoid the worst effects of the
recession.
'It looked for a while as though most people, apart from the unions, were
just going to sit back quietly and let it happen,' reflects Rutherford.
What was a catastrophe for a relatively old, immensely experienced workforce
at least provided Aztec with the chance to use its initiative and to employ
its untested skills in mobilising a community into action.
Rutherford says she has always seen a broad role for Tecs as brokers, acting
as a catalyst to bring a range of local agencies together to help the
business community fulfil its potential.
Aztec's board of directors, drawn from the business world, did not think it
fit to question the commercial decisions of BAe, which is spending Pounds 2m
to help ease the pain of closure and advise on jobs, retraining and business
start-ups.
But the board was anxious to assess the impact and to consider a strategy
for minimizing the damage.
In the first public-private partnership of its type, Aztec joined forces
with BAe, the three boroughs and other local bodies and set up a task force
to address the issues.
The first results have just emerged in the shape of a report which
identifies the short-term consequences of BAe's departure from Kingston and
which tries to establish its effect on longer-term economic trends in the
area.
The report, which should offer lessons for other companies and communities
faced with similar upheavals, makes a detailed impact analysis of the
closure and considers future uses for the Richmond Road site.
But Aztec also hopes the document's value will be in providing a strategic
framework for a programme of economic development in its area on which
public and private sectors can co-operate.
The authors believe that the creation of a more systematic approach to
monitoring employment changes and economic activity will help the process of
forward planning.
In turn, that should encourage a better targeted approach to business
support, training and other local economic development initiatives. For
Aztec itself, the real challenge is to ensure that it maintains some
momentum.
It intends to keep the task force going, possibly broadening it with the
inclusion of the trade unions and the local chamber of commerce. Together
with the three councils, Aztec is now considering appointing an officer to
trawl for EC funds to help them get on with their job.
Immediate plans involve a further study to identify the prospects for inward
investment and measures to help retrain older workers and relocate
unemployed executives. There will also be courses for women having to return
to work to supplement household incomes.
With the local citizens' advice bureau swamped with requests for help, Aztec
expects to have its own help-line operating in April.
But all the good intentions and strategic objectives in the world run up,
inevitably, against the expenditure restraints of which Tecs now
increasingly complain.
Rutherford admits there is a great deal of frustration over the inability of
TECs to fulfil the valuable role for which they were established, adding:
'We are looking at a cake which will simply not begin to feed everyone'.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Management: Adding up the cost of a give-away budget - Tony
Allen warns finance directors that Norman Lamont may have plans up his
sleeve that would damage their cash flow / Tax checklist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finance directors may have more to fear than look forward to in Norman
Lamont's second Budget, now less than a fortnight away.
Despite the expectations of tax cuts for all, March 10 may not be a
red-letter day for everyone. Here is a checklist of the main items for
finance directors to keep an eye on as they set - or re-set - their own
budgets.
INCOME TAX CHANGES
Income tax is bound to be reduced - either by higher thresholds or lower
rates - and while this is good news for taxpayers, it is not so good for
their employers.
A cut in income tax means a reduction in the amount the employer withholds
from wages. At present, companies can hold on to the tax for up to three
months before paying it to the Inland Revenue, although the average period
is one-and-a-half months.
Any reduction in the amount withheld will reduce the cash flow of companies:
for each Pounds 1m a year of wages, the cost might be Pounds 500 in
additional interest costs.
The same principle holds true for any cut in National Insurance
contributions.
The basic rate of income tax can be important for companies in other ways.
Those which borrow from non-banks are potentially liable to deduct income
tax from interest payments. If the rate of tax falls, so will the amount of
income tax that the borrower has to withhold - another hit on the cash flow.
One positive effect could be for growing businesses, as a lower rate of
income tax will set an equally lower rate of small companies' corporation
tax.
This would not benefit them until 1993 at the earliest, given the minimum
nine-month delay in paying corporation tax. The small companies' rate now
applies to the majority of companies in the UK.
ADVANCE CORPORATION TAX
Companies are required to pay ACT at the rate of income tax on all
dividends. The ACT can be offset against the company's corporation tax, but
with significant limitations. It has been estimated that these cost the UK
corporate sector Pounds 400m a year. Representations on the way that ACT
operates have been made for many years, but with little result.
Any reduction in the rate of income tax will reduce the amount of ACT
payable on future dividends, which must be good news. However, it will also
reduce the amount of the offset in future years unless the rate of
corporation tax is also reduced, of which so far there has been little
indication.
In other words, companies that are already suffering from having surplus ACT
will be less able to relieve the surplus in the future.
Since the accounting rules require surplus ACT to be treated as an
additional tax charge, a reduction in the basic income tax rate will
perversely cause an increase in many companies' tax charge in their
accounts.
INVESTMENT ALLOWANCES
There has been much speculation on whether the Lawson Budget packages of the
early 1980s - which cut the level of tax relief on capital investment -
might be reversed.
The old, first-year allowances, which gave full tax relief in the year of
spend, were said at best to be irrelevant to investment decisions, and at
worst to distort them. Now the Confederation of British Industry and others
are asking that higher levels of allowances are reintroduced.
This could be done in a number of ways. First-year allowances could be
introduced on a higher level of annual relief (currently 25 per cent, on a
reducing balance basis) on capital equipment.
Alternatively, Lamont could set different rates for different types of
investment, as is the case already in the US, Germany and Japan. It is
unlikely that he will consider the lower level of allowances on buildings in
the present climate.
A straight-line basis gives equal relief over, say, four years with a 25 per
cent rate. The reducing balance basis only gives 70 per cent relief over the
same period.
Introducing the straight-line basis would be a very easy change to make and
would eliminate the UK's archaic system of calculating allowances and give
higher relief at a stroke. The changes would only help those who are tax
payers, or have been in the last three years.
Moreover, there is also no new evidence that the decline in investment over
the last couple of years is anything to do with the rate of allowances.
The finance director will not get any early benefit from changes in
allowances, since they will take effect only over a number of years and
accounting rules on deferred taxation may require compensating deferred tax
charges. While cash flow may be a little better next year, the company's
reported profits may show no benefit.
Finally, additional allowances can take a long time to produce any benefit.
If additional reliefs are introduced from April 1 this year for a company
that has an accounts date of March 31, the resulting reduction in tax will
not help its cash flow until 1994. Even the most pessimistic commentators
seem to accept that there should be some improvement in the economy by then.
MONTHLY ACCOUNTING FOR VAT.
In an attempt to forestall the national cash flow implications of the
changes to VAT accounting in Europe in 1993, Customs &amp; Excise announced last
November that the largest UK payers of VAT would be required to pay over
their VAT more quickly, on a monthly basis (from the current quarterly
basis) from this October.
This will advance by an average of 45 days the VAT payments that these
companies currently make. Some of those most affected are appealing to the
courts that Customs is exceeding its statutory authority.
One large group has estimated that the additional internal administration
costs of meeting the proposal may be Pounds 1m. To forestall these problems,
Lamont may feel that he should give the proposals more authority, and
include them in his Budget.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Wide agenda at first meeting -
Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALBERT REYNOLDS has his first meeting as Irish prime minister with Mr
John Major today amid only faintly optimistic signs that Northern Ireland's
political leaders are edging towards restarting 'round-table' negotiations.
Prospects for political progress will be high on Downing Street's agenda.
Both prime ministers are anxious to promote a dialogue between the two
governments to avoid creating a lull in political activity which could
encourage terrorists.
However, little substantive progress appears to have been made towards
resuming the political talks which collapsed last July - a task Mr Major set
the province's four main political leaders when he met them two weeks ago.
Difficulties remain over how to bridge a possible change of British
government.
The four leaders are expected to meet at Westminster tomorrow to discuss
political progress. Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist leader, expressed
hope earlier this week that talks could resume before the general election,
but the likely choice of April 9 for the contest makes a resumption of
formal talks beforehand extremely unlikely.
So far only informal political discussions have been held between Mr James
Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two unionist leaders, Mr John Hume,
leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, and Dr John
Alderdice, leader of the cross-community Alliance party.
The four are expected to meet Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary,
in Belfast on Monday to discuss the province's economy as part of government
efforts to keep some form of dialogue going.
Downing Street said today's topics were 'across the board', and would
include the European Community as well as Northern Ireland. In December Mr
Major agreed to meet every six months with Mr Charles Haughey, the then
Irish prime minister.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major again rejects referendum -
Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday sought to calm the nerves of
Scottish Conservatives by envisaging an increase in their representation at
Westminster after the general election.
His remarks, at prime minister's question time, came in the wake of Monday's
debate on devolution at the Scottish Grand Committee sitting in Edinburgh.
There was derisive laughter from opposition MPs pressing for constitutional
change when he told the Commons that this was one of the factors he had in
mind when promising to 'take stock' of the situation if the government was
given a renewed mandate.
Mrs Margaret Ewing, Scottish Nationalist MP for Moray, underlined her
party's demand for independence by suggesting that the Scottish people
should be given the right to determine their own future through a
referendum.
The prime minister answered: 'Your party seeks isolation for Scotland. I do
not believe that prescription is in the interests of Scotland or in the
interests of the rest of the UK.'
He emphasised that ways of increasing the strength of the union would also
form part of the taking stock exercise.
In a letter to the prime minister, Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow Scottish
secretary, pressed him to recognise, as the Conservatives 'headed for
oblivion' in Scotland, that the status quo was no longer an option.
Mr Dewar stated: 'The Scottish people must be given what they demand - a
parliament in Scotland now.'

FT  26 FEB 92 / Top-of-range private medical plan launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWICH Union Healthcare yesterday launched a top-of-the-range private
medical insurance scheme which will eliminate the need for most clients to
use the National Health Service.
The Premier Care policy will be marketed by Norwich Union for 'people who do
not want to rely on the NHS.'
Treatment for a number of conditions and procedures which are excluded from
many private medical insurance schemes - among them infertility, long-term
renal dialysis and pregnancy - will be covered. It will also pay for
consultations with private GPs and include private dental treatment and eye
tests.
The Premier Care policy will be aimed at individuals willing to pay a
higher-than-average premium to side-step the NHS in most eventualities.
The cost of the new policy will depend on age and medical history, with a
healthy 35-year-old paying about Pounds 1,000 a year. Most pre-existing
conditions will be taken on for a higher premium.

BASS LEISURE, the betting division of the brewing and hotels group, and the
Horse-race Totalisator Board yesterday announced a joint venture to promote
off-course pool betting on horseracing.
One of the main aims of the joint venture, Tote Direct, is to develop a new

designed to produce a winning payout of Pounds 250,000 or more for small
stakes.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Building societies fare badly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING SOCIETIES fared badly on both sides of their business in January
according to figures published yesterday by the Building Societies
Association.
There was little sign of improvement in the societies' mortgage business.
Net new lending was Pounds 2.26bn, down from Pounds 2.53bn in December. Net
advances were up at Pounds 1.35bn from Pounds 1.16bn but this was well below
the Pounds 1.67bn for January last year, when figures were depressed by the
impending Gulf war.
In spite of the very poor showing in the mortgage market, Mr Mark Boleat,
director-general of the BSA, said seasonal factors were largely responsible.
'The recently reported signs of an upturn in housing market activity would
not have shown through in the January figures,' he said. City housing market
analysts described the figures as extremely disappointing, however.
Building societies enjoyed a modest upturn in their savings business in
January after two months in which there were net outflows of savings.
The improved performance in January, when Pounds 293m flowed into the
societies compared with an outflow of Pounds 54m in December, may have been
linked to the first anniversary of Tessa accounts.
The January figure was the highest since June. Mr Boleat said, however, the
underlying flow of savings was subdued and that this pattern seemed set to
continue for the foreseeable future.

<TEXT>
BRAZIL's initial proposal for the rescheduling of its Dollars 21bn-Dollars
22bn debt with the Paris Club group of creditor governments has been
rejected in the first day of negotiations in Paris. However, Brazilian
economy ministry officials yesterday remained confident agreement would be
reached this week.
The Brazilian negotiating team, led by Mr Francisco Gros, the central bank
governor, was working on a new proposal yesterday after German and Japanese
representatives had refused to accept Brazil's original offer.
The main sticking point is Brazil's insistence on including in the
rescheduling, debt that was rescheduled in the last accord in 1988. Mr Gros
said on Friday that this accord had created an excessive concentration of
repayments over the next two years.
Brazil's original proposal asked for the rescheduling of Dollars 13.5bn over
18 years. This includes Dollars 8.6bn in arrears and Dollars 4.9bn in
payments due over the next two years as a result of the 1988 accord. Only in
exceptional circumstances does the Paris Club agree to reschedule already
rescheduled debt and Brazil's non-payment of interest for the last three
years has not endeared it to official creditors.
They complain that they have been receiving worse treatment than the
commercial banks to which Brazil started paying 30 per cent of due interest
last year.
According to Brazilian economy ministry officials, the Germans and Japanese
are insisting that Brazil respect the 1988 accord. The Brazilian team
pointed out that it has not asked for a reduction of the principal and
maintains that it does not have the capacity to pay under the previous
terms. However, creditors believe that Brazilian reserves are now at their
highest levels since the start of the debt crisis.
Despite these differences the negotiations are said to be taking place in a
favourable climate and Brazil has received unexpected support from the
presence of Mr Enrique Iglesias, head of the Inter-American Development
Bank, who has flown to Paris specially to make a personal presentation
backing the government's new stabilisation programme.

A WEEKEND accord aimed at the eventual return of Haiti's ousted President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide has angered right-wingers, touching off a
demonstration by more than 200 of his foes outside the Legislative Palace

The deal, struck in Washington by Mr Aristide and some leading Haitian
lawmakers, appeared in danger of unravelling yesterday, with Mr Aristide
saying further talks were necessary on the fate of the army chief who
overthrew him.
Mr Aristide and prime minister-designate Rene Theodore were also apparently

FT  26 FEB 92 / Caterpillar digs in for bruising fight: Four months on
strike may earn the UAW no more than a Pyrrhic victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE three-month labour dispute between Caterpillar, the world's largest
maker of earth-moving equipment, and the powerful United Auto Workers union
is becoming more and more bruising.
After last week's failure to restart negotiations, the company and the union
have dug in for a protracted battle which observers believe will produce no
real winners. Bets are that the dispute could rival the seven-month strike
of 1982-1983, the longest in UAW history.
The union, which in early November sent out on strike only 2,400 workers,
last week sent out a further 8,400, bringing the total to two-thirds of its
members at Caterpillar. This included the 5,650 workers whom the company had
locked out as a retaliatory step in November but had recalled nine days ago.
The union is determined to win a pattern contract agreement from Caterpillar
comparable with the one that it agreed last year with Deere &amp; Co, another
heavy equipment manufacturer. Pattern agreements, which are designed to
establish contract patterns throughout an industry, are the heart and soul
of the UAW's strength, particularly in relation to the big US car makers.
The three-year Deere agreement, which is broadly in line with the UAW's auto
company contracts, includes a 3 per cent general wage increase in the first
year, 3 per cent lump sum bonuses in the second and third years and job
security and benefits provisions wanted by the union.
Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Illinois, says it must have an agreement that
will allow it to continue to be internationally competitive. Last year,
sales outside the US accounted for Dollars 5.8bn, or 59 per cent, of the
company's Dollars 9.84bn total. It says a pattern agreement would undercut
its long-term viability.
The company, which lost Dollars 404m in 1991, claims that the strike did not
have a significant effect on last year's results but says the dispute is
'seriously clouding the outlook' for this year. A first-quarter loss is now
expected, and, as the spring construction season arrives, the company may
face difficulties in meeting orders despite having built up several months
of inventory before the strike.
The company vows 'to do whatever it takes to keep customers from buying
competitors' products,' and speculation has grown that, if a settlement is
not reached soon, the company may try to employ non-union replacement
workers. This has been fueled by Caterpillar's recent engagement of Vance
International, the private security firm known for its tough tactics in in
recent years involving companies' attempts to break their unions.
Caterpillar says that it hired Vance after receiving threats, and that it
had to take 'steps to protect its people and property.'
Security analysts take a dim view of the possibility of the hiring of
replacement workers. 'If they do that, you'll have a war in Peoria,' said Mr
Tobias Levkovich, a security analyst with Smith Barney Upham.
Labour experts say Caterpillar management is more likely eventually to
concede a pattern agreement and then quietly move as many jobs as possible,
either overseas or to non-union US plants, giving the UAW a Pyrrhic victory.
The union, however, cannot afford to flinch: if a Caterpillar precedent is
set that breaks the tradition of pattern agreements, it could face a demand
from the car makers to re-open negotiations and thereby risk having its
power undermined.
Moreover, this is a delicate time for the UAW leadership, which faces
re-election in June at the union's triennial convention. It will not want to
serve up to its members a defeat in Peoria and bleak prospects in the
nation's car-making capital of Detroit. In an attempt to demonstrate union
might and solidarity, the UAW leadership has called on its own members and
those of other unions to march in Peoria on March 22. The UAW will be hoping
that the march will not prove to be its last big stand.
The Caterpillar-UAW dispute is spilling over ominously into the economy of
Illinois, where the company has its largest operations. The length of the
strike will be a significant element in determining when the state can
emerge from recession, according to Ms Diane Swonk, First Chicago's
economist for the Midwest region. She calculates that as many as 7,000 of
the 17,000 manufacturing jobs lost in the state last year were related to
the strike.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US proposals to allow cross-border pursuit of drug traffickers in Latin
America have been dropped from the draft declaration for the seven-nation
drugs summit convening today in San Antonio, Texas.
Unless revived at the two-day summit, the dropping of the US proposals
represents a victory for the three Andean countries which produce the
overwhelming majority of the world's coca, the leaf from which cocaine is
derived. Peru, Bolivia and Colombia saw the proposals as potential US
threats to their sovereignty.
US-drafted 'talking points' used as the basis for pre-San Antonio
negotiations earlier this month in Quito, had pressed for formation of a
'regional conference and action group' with wide powers of bilateral and
multilateral sanction.
Common jurisdiction over sea and airspace would, under the proposal, have
allowed aircraft or warships of one member country to enter another's
territory in pursuit of drugs traffickers. The Andean Commission of Jurists
said that these rights 'would in fact be exercised by that member with the
means and desire to execute them' - in other words, the US.
All such controversial proposals have been eliminated from the joint
statement, which merely calls for 'mutual co-operation .. with full respect
for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our nations'.
In addition to the US and the three Andean coca producers who met at the
last drugs summit in Cartagena two years ago, the presidents of Mexico and
Ecuador will attend. The Venezuelan president, Mr Carlos Andres Perez, was
also due to attend, although is reported to have changed his plans after
this month's coup attempt.
The draft declaration 'vigorously' reaffirms the Cartagena declaration of
two years ago. It claims advances - some of which are disputed elsewhere -
in reducing production of and demand for coca and areas under cultivation,
in creating alternative development programmes and in dismantling
transnational drugs trafficking organisations and financial networks.
The declaration, however, admits that the Cartagena objectives on coca crop
substitution 'have not been altogether fulfilled'. It expresses hopes that
an 'important new initiative' for training, technical assistance in
marketing and animal and plant health will improve matters.
The Andean countries call for, and the US takes note of, the need for an
'Alternative Development Facility' under the umbrella of an international
financial institution. This would provide short-term financing until
alternative development plans mature.
The heads of state call upon the countries of Europe and Asia, expanding
markets for cocaine, to co-operate in the fight against drugs. But success
in the fight is principally depicted economically, as dependent upon 'strong
economies and innovative economic initiatives'.

<TEXT>
THE European Community will step up economic and political co-operation with
Central America to promote development and human rights, following a meeting
of EC and Central American foreign ministers which ended in Lisbon
yesterday.
Several programmes of economic and technical assistance were agreed,
including Ecu13.8m (Pounds 9.78m) to help improve telecommunications in the
six Central American countries, and a separate Ecu7m for El Salvador to
support small enterprises and projects in areas most affected by the 12-year
civil war.
Assistance to support national reconstruction in El Salvador was also
discussed yesterday in a separate meeting called by Portugal, the current EC
president, with representatives from the Community, the US, Canada, Japan,
other donor countries, and the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
El Salvador's government says it needs around Dollars 1bn to rebuild the
economy following the civil war. The EC has already promised up to Ecu50m.
In Washington yesterday, President Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador said he
expected the US to provide around Dollars 250m in reconstruction aid. The
Bush administration has asked Congress to approve the aid and has promised
to give its full support to moves to help rebuild El Salvador's economy, Mr
Cristiani said.
The announcement came as a surprise to EC officials who reacted with some
irritation. 'It's another example of the US jumping on an initiative without
telling anyone else and claiming leadership,' said one diplomat in Lisbon.
Support for human rights and democracy were dominant concerns among EC
ministers who also agreed to an Ecu1.5m programme for the promotion of human
rights in the region. This will help to provide better training for police
and armed forces, and support human rights initiatives.

FT  26 FEB 92 / India raises rail fares by 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indian government yesterday raised passenger rail fares by about 20 per
cent in a move seen as a foretaste of the austerity budget expected later
this week.
The sharp increase in fares reflects the pressure on the government to cut
the budget deficit through reducing financial support to public sector
units.
The railways, the budget for which was presented to parliament yesterday, is
the largest of the government-owned enterprises.
The increase, which follows a 10-20 per cent increase in rail fares in July,
means that the railways revenue from passenger traffic will rise by 33 per
cent in 1992-93 over the original budget estimates for the current year.
Mr CK Jaffer Sharief, the railways minister, told parliament the cost of
running uneconomic lines had risen more than fivefold from Rs4bn (Pounds
88m) in 1980-81 to Rs22.2bn last year.
In an effort to generate further financial resources, Mr Sharief said that
the railways would seek to lease or sell some of the land it owns in central
cities - beginning with Bombay.
The armed forces, the largest landowners in the country, are to follow a
similar policy as a way of raising funds.
First class fares are to rise by 20 per cent and second class fares by about
17 per cent. Some season tickets will go up by 40-48 per cent.
Mr LK Advani, the leader of the Hindu radical BJP party which until recently
supported the government's liberalisation and restructuring programme,
said the rail minister had 'not just been harsh. He has been cruel. As far
as I recall such a massive hike in railway fares and freight is
unprecedented.'

Indonesia yesterday banned from its waters a Portuguese ship planning to
sail to East Timor to mark an army massacre of civilians, accusing its
sponsors of being troublemakers, Reuter reports from Timor.
The foreign ministry said the planned visit by the Lusitania Expresso, which
left Lisbon last month, was politically motivated to aggravate tension in
East Timor and incite disturbances.
The vessel is due to call at Darwin in north Australia to pick up 100
students and journalists before sailing to the East Timor capital Dili where
it is expected around March 3. Those travelling on the ship intend to lay a
wreath at the cemetery where Indonesian troops killed scores of mourners
last November.
Indonesia annexed East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in 1976 in a move
which remains unrecognised by the United Nations.

<TEXT>
THE founder of South Korea's Hyundai group, who has launched a party to
challenge President Roh Tae-woo's government, blamed the government
yesterday for the financial woes of the group's subsidiaries, Reuter reports
from Seoul.
'Hyundai risks defaulting on bills due to the government's persistent credit
control and tax investigation imposed on group subsidiaries,' Mr Chung
Ju-yung, 70, was quoted as saying by a spokesman for his National
Unification Party.
Mr Roh's ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) attacked Mr Chung's statement
as a ploy to win public sympathy before next month's general elections.
'Chung is resorting to blackmail. . . in a bid to fulfil his political
ambition, making an illicit use of Hyundai group,' Mr Park Bum-jin, a DLP
spokesman, said.
Mr Chung initially refused to pay Won136.1bn (Pounds 101.8m) in penalty
taxes but later changed his mind. Since then, domestic banks have frozen
fresh loans to the group, the tax office has launched a second tax
investigation and the Securities Supervisory Board has postponed approval on
Hyundai units' rights issues for the sixth time, Hyundai officials said.
Daewoo, South Korea's fourth largest business group, said yesterday it was
suspending its plan for the first joint ventures with North Korea.
Disappointed by the outcome of talks between the prime ministers of North
and South last week, Seoul said any economic exchanges would be banned until
North Korea allowed inspection of nuclear facilities.
'We have also decided to put off the plan to send our executives to North
Korea for a feasibility study of the joint venture project,' a Daewoo
spokesman said.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Japan yesterday faced renewed calls for a cut in interest rates
following the publication of a government report acknowledging a further
deterioration in the state of the economy.
The government's Economic Planning Agency dropped the word 'expansion' from
its monthly report to the cabinet for the first time since the economic
upturn in early 1987. Instead of saying that the economy was 'expanding at a
slower pace' - the favourite phrase of recent months - the agency said the
economic slow down was spreading to a wider range of sectors.
The agency's report echoed recent commentaries by private sector economists
who have almost all taken a more pessimistic view of the economy than the
government. For the current financial year, ending next month, economists
expect a growth rate of about 3.5 per cent against the government forecast
of about 3.7 per cent. For next year, private sector predictions mostly
range 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent against a government target of 3.5 per
cent.
Ruling party politicians, with an eye on an election to the Diet's
(parliament's) upper house this summer, would like to see measures to
stimulate growth, including further cuts in interest rates. Mr Kozo
Watanabe, the minister for international trade and industry, yesterday
called for a cut in the official discount rate to follow the last reduction
in December when the ODR was reduced to 4.5 per cent.
The central bank's position is that it is still examining the effects of the
last reduction and of two previous cuts. However, pressure for further
reductions grows almost daily, not least from industrialists anxious about
weakening demand, particularly for capital goods.

<TEXT>
THE Philippine government should take urgent action to stop unlawful
killings by its security forces, according to Amnesty International, the
human rights movement.
In a report published today, it says that at least 550 unarmed people,
including children and elderly people with no connection to the opposition,
have been killed by government or government-backed forces since 1988.
Members of the army, police and officially-backed militia groups and
civilian groups have carried out killings, as well as paramilitary and
vigilante groups working in collusion with security forces or with their
acquiescence.
In addition, hundreds of people have 'disappeared' while in police or
military custody, Amnesty says.
Abuses of human rights reflect the strong influence of the military in
Philippine politics even after the restoration of democracy under President
Corazon Aquino in 1986. The military has been given considerable freedom to
counter armed opposition groups.
Amnesty said the practice of 'red-labelling' - publicly identifying alleged
opponents of the government as subversives - particularly contributed to the
killing.
The Philippines: the killing goes on. Amnesty International. Free.

EC complaints that Poland plans to discriminate in favour of imports from
certain Community car-makers are threatening to delay implementation next
week of a EC-Poland free trade pact, Andrew Hill reports from Brussels.
Member states were supposed to approve the accord at yesterday's meeting of
internal market ministers, but France raised objections to Poland's plan to
divide its quota of duty-free car imports between General Motors, Fiat and
Volkswagen only. EC diplomats will discuss the problem in Brussels today.
Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry and internal market commissioner, said the
legal services of the Commission and Council of Ministers agreed the Polish
action infringed non-discrimination clauses in the accord. A French official
said Paris wanted to ensure the clauses were observed, not take reciprocal
action against Polish car exports to the EC.
The agreement was signed last year, but at the end of last month, the Polish
ministry of foreign economic relations said the quota of 30,000 passenger
cars which could be imported free of duty from the EC would be split between
Fiat, GM and Volkswagen as a reward for their promises of investment with
Polish partners. But Mr Bangemann said member states were unanimous the move
was discriminatory.

<TEXT>
JAPAN's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) has concluded the country's six biggest
corporate groups are becoming less reliant on in-house dealings and their
extensive cross-shareholdings do not lead to exclusionary business
practices, Robert Thomson reports from Tokyo.
The findings will be presented in Washington today to a follow-up meeting
for the US-Japan Structural Impediments Initiative (SII), designed to remove
'structural' barriers to trade with Japan and cut the US-Japanese trade
deficit.
The corporate groupings, or keiretsu, head a list of US concerns about
access to the Japanese market; it is unlikely the FTC report, based on a
study of the groups' dealings in 1989, will satisfy Washington.
The FTC found that the six leading groups, the Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo,
Fuyo, Sanwa and Dai-Ichi Kangyo keiretsu, relied on in-group procurement for
an average of 8.1 per cent of their total procurement, down from 11.7 per
cent in 1981.
But, for certain strategic items, such as computers, the in-house sales
ratio is far higher. The FTC found that groups used an electronics company
in the same family for an average of 33.6 per cent of mainframe computer
purchases, down from 35.6 per cent in 1981.

FT  26 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Jakarta jockeys for a stronger trading
voice - Reform has won Indonesia more credibility in world forums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE BOLDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC policy makers in Indonesia have developed an unnerving habit of
listening in silence to advice from outside, then acting on it just as even
the most friendly critics are starting to despair. Jakarta's successive
trade reforms of recent years are a case in point.
The World Bank and Gatt last year praised Indonesia for its efforts to free
up its trade system but urged it to go further. Jakarta obliged: more cuts
in import tariffs were announced, including those on the heavily-regulated
palm oil industry, where export curbs were lifted.
Indonesia has undertaken a series of trade reforms since the mid-1980s when
plunging oil prices forced it to realise it would have to diversify its
economy to survive. Oil and gas exports could no longer be depended on as
its mainstays; domestic export-oriented industries would have to be
encouraged, and cumbersome monopolies dismantled.
Among the measures aimed at moving away from non-tariff barriers and at
cutting and rationalising existing tariffs was the elimination in 1986 of
import duties on components for re-export. The established system of export
licences was scrapped a year later, and, the next year, non-tariff barriers
were replaced by tariffs on more than 300 import products.
In 1990, tariffs were cut on nearly 2,500 items, including components for
the heavily-regulated pharmaceutical industry. Export controls on
commodities including coffee were abolished, and licensing procedures for
cattle breeding and fishing simplified.
Last June, the government moved closer to its intention of shifting the
tariff ceiling down to about 30 per cent, when it cut import tariffs on more
than 500 products from beef to glass and steel. Non-tariff barriers on a
quarter of the products protected by such barriers were replaced by some
form of direct tariff protection.
'What they have done so far is brave,' says Ms Mary Pangestu, an economist
at the government-backed Centre for Strategic and International Studies. But
like other analysts, she urges further steps, and more transparent planning
reform. 'The key is competitive domestic industry. That must be the goal.'
Perhaps bravest of all, Indonesia sacked its customs staff in 1985 and hired
the Swiss firm Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS) as its agent for
inspecting goods and assessing duties on imports and exports. But some
anomalies still remain, along with areas where vested interests appear to
have held back the government back.
One of these was the 1990 decision to grant a consortium headed by President
Suharto's youngest son the exclusive right to the international and domestic
trade in cloves. Reports reaching Jakarta indicate the setting-up of the
monopoly has resulted in substantial disruption to trade in the 80,000
tonnes of cloves produced annually in Indonesia.
It has also led to a drop in income for farmers who were to be the main
beneficiaries of the new system. The clove cigarette industry, one of
Indonesia's biggest employers and the consumer of nearly all its clove
output, is paying at least three times more for its clove supplies.
Policy on products from Indonesia's tropical forests has also been
questioned. Export of raw logs and raw and semi-processed rattan has been
banned; a prohibitive tax on exports of sawn logs was imposed in 1989. The
measures have attracted criticism, but the government has dug in its heels.
Mr Sudradjad Djiwandono, junior minister for trade, says the bans and taxes
are intended mainly to encourage development of domestic industries.
The World Bank saw things differently. The rattan policy had 'reduced
incomes of farmers in several outer island provinces,' while the sawn timber
taxes had 'driven a number of small sawmills out of business.'
A tendency to use surcharges in compensation for eliminating non-tariff
barriers is widely considered to be inconsistent with Indonesian trade
reform, as is the protection afforded to parts of the motor vehicle industry
and large areas of farm output.
Analysts say the allocation of quotas for the textile industry should be
tidied up and the system made more transparent. Measures to help the
developing economies of Indonesia's outer islands are also called for.
Local-level regulations such as those on the movement of cattle or copra
between provinces are believed to hinder economic activity outside Java.
The Indonesian authorities acknowledge the system is not yet perfect. 'There
are still many things that could be improved,' says Mr Djiwandono, but adds
that the direction is clear.
One of the effects of reform has been to give Indonesia more credibility in
world trade forums such as Gatt, and a stronger voice in what Jakarta sees
as the developing world's fight against the power of western trading blocs.

FT  26 FEB 92 / World Trade News: France, Germany in dispute over Airbus
assembly

THE launch of a new European Airbus 125-seat airliner, the A319, is being
held back by French demands that it should be assembled in France rather
than Germany.
The disagreement over the A319, a shorter derivative of the A320 twin-engine
narrow-body airliner, highlights again the problems of managing the
collaborative Airbus programme between its four partners: Aerospatiale of
France (37.9 per cent), Deutsche Aerospace (37.9 per cent), British
Aerospace (20 per cent) and Casa of Spain (4.2 per cent).
The German and UK partners back the new programme, but Aerospatiale argues
assembly at Hamburg would cut its overall workshare below its 37.9 per cent
stake. Airbuses have traditionally been assembled at Aerospatiale's plant in
Toulouse. But Germany won its bid two years ago to locate at Hamburg all
final assembly and internal fittings of the A321, a stretched derivative of
the A320, due to be delivered to its first customers in 1994.
Assembly of the proposed new A319 at Hamburg, giving Germany final assembly
of a second Airbus aircraft, would tie in with the Airbus supervisory
board's decision to concentrate final assembly and final internal fittings
to customer specification at one site, rather than split between Toulouse
and Hamburg, as before. But Aerospatiale is understood to be opposing
Hamburg assembly of the A319 and urging assembly in Toulouse, which already
assembles the A300/A310 widebody airliners, the A320 and the new A330/A340
long-range widebody jets.
The row risks delaying the launch of the Dollars 300m (Pounds 171.4m)
programme to build the 125-seater aircraft. Airbus was wanting a go-ahead
from its supervisory board to start offering the new aircraft to airline
customers at the end of next month. It has argued the A319 would complete
its family of narrow-body airliners and help it compete more strongly
against its US rivals Boeing and McDonnell Douglas which offer
125-seat-range aircraft. Airbus has dropped the idea of building an even
smaller A320 derivative with 100 seats.

THE UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad VIII) has approved an
institutional reform package designed to revitalise the organisation, Sarita
Kendall reports from Cartagena, Colombia.
The 171 member-nations have been working for change which, many delegates
hope, will influence other UN bodies.
Four new standing committees on commodities, poverty alleviation, economic
co-operation among developing countries and service sectors are to replace
most existing committees. Ad hoc working groups will deal with special
issues related to trade and development, such as investment, privatisation,
trade efficiency, exports and technology.
The declaration, 'The Spirit of Cartagena' agreed by members stressed: 'It
is important to overcome confrontation and foster a climate of genuine
co-operation and solidarity'. Unctad would give priority to problems facing
least developed countries and to the fight against poverty. The conference
showed strong agreement on economic growth policies: market economies, with
trade liberalisation and some privatisation, are almost universally accepted
by developing and industrialised nations.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Aer Lingus faces fine over ticketing move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FINE on Aer Lingus, the Irish national carrier, for refusing to grant
reciprocal ticketing rights to British Midland, the UK airline, is to be
announced by the European Commission today.
The Brussels competition directorate believes that Aer Lingus' move to scrap
a long-standing 'inter-lining' agreement with British Midland in 1989 - just
when the latter started flying to Dublin - constituted an illegal abuse of
the Irish carrier's dominant position on the London-Dublin route.
Inter-lining agreements allow travel agents to issue passengers with a
single ticket allowing them to change airlines on different legs of their
journeys.
Brussels favours such agreements, not only because they give customers more
flexibility but also because, at a time when the Commission is seeking to
liberalise air travel, they make it easier for airlines to pick up
passengers on new routes and thereby encourage entry into the market.
Last year's withdrawal by British Airways from the London-Dublin route has
helped in fact both Aer Lingus and British Midland since. Inter-lining
agreements are common between EC airlines, but not obligatory. However,
according to the EC competition directorate, in reacting to direct route
competition from British Midland by scrapping the ticketing agreement it had
had with the UK airline since 1964, the Irish carrier was abusing its
dominant position in flights to and from the Irish capital.
In an earlier case involving Air Europe, the Commission defended the right
of a smaller airline to an inter-lining arrangement with a bigger carrier.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STALIN'S membership card and Boris Pasternak's pleadings for royalties from
his novel Dr Zhivago went on public display yesterday as Soviet Communist
party archives were thrown open for the first time.
Having rounded up the once-secret files in the heady days following the
abortive coup last August, the Russian government has inaugurated a reading
room around the corner from the ex-central committee building, the party's
former headquarters.
Only a tiny selection of the files was on display, but it was a graphic
illustration of the now outlawed party's far-reaching control over every
detail of Soviet life.
For example, a report written in 1986 by Mr Alexander Yakovlev, the
acknowledged godfather of glasnost, provided the central committee with
details of a meeting with Graham Greene, the British writer. Such reports
were until recently routine practice for any senior party official who had
contacts with foreigners.
The exhibition was also interesting for what it did not show. Documents on
controversial topics such as party finances and support for western
communist parties were not displayed. Indeed, only 30 per cent of the files
are deemed fit for public consumption, in the absence of legislation on
state secrets and the right to privacy.
Mr Rudolf Pikhoya, chairman of the government's archives committee, said his
centre had almost half the 70m Communist party files available in Russia for
the period 1952-91.
He said that all documents from the past 10 years would remain off-bounds
until state experts had determined which should remain classified.
But Mr Pikhoya is expecting soon to receive a number of files from the
personal archives of former president Mikhail Gorbachev. Yesterday's
exhibition featured Mr Gorbachev's membership card from 1952, when he was
studying law at Moscow State university.
Visitors were also treated to a recording of a speech in which the Soviet
leader pledged his undying support to the party whose demise he was unable
to prevent.
'The party's interests are for me no less dear than to those who try to
doubt my allegiance to it,' Mr Gorbachev told the central committee less
than a year ago.
Access to documents will be free of charge for academics, but other visitors
will have to pay a fee, as befits the new free market regime.

FT  26 FEB 92 / CIS states give pledge on arms cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUCCESSOR states to the Soviet Union have promised to agree by the end
of May on a share-out of the weapons cuts to which Moscow committed itself
under the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, a Nato official
said yesterday.
At a meeting with Nato and east European countries in Brussels last Friday,
members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) promised to
re-allocate the weapons reductions in time for a special conference at the
end of May, in the hope that the CFE treaty could come into force by this
summer's Helsinki conference.
The five other members of the defunct Warsaw Pact have ratified the CFE
pact, as have 11 Nato countries; the remaining five Nato members expected to
do so very soon. But it is a tall order for the CIS states to settle their
raging quarrels about redistributing Soviet military resources within the
next three months.
The CFE treaty, setting geographic ceilings on tanks, artillery, combat
aircraft and helicopters, covers the territory of eight CIS members.
However, three of these - Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan - are outside the CIS
joint military command.
The treaty was negotiated on the basis of the old Soviet military districts,
whose boundaries do not coincide with the new CIS borders. It thus allows
Ukraine far more weapons than Russia (west of the Urals), but also splits it
in two, along the dividing line between the old Soviet military districts of
Kiev and Odessa.
Nato officials said yesterday they hoped to get away with only minor
technical adjustments to the treaty, which they said was 'the cornerstone'
of any further arms control, such as the troop reductions being discussed in
Vienna.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Gloom on French economy - but the doom is overdone: If the
recessionary clouds are darker than expected, they are not without a silver
lining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST every time President Francois Mitterrand appears in public, he chides
the French people for their pervasive mood of gloom.
'France has the highest average income in Europe,' he said earlier this
month. 'I want to convince you that the French are as capable as others of
overcoming the crisis. Our economy is in good health.'
Fundamentally the French economy is indeed in good health, and it has
received an approving verdict in the latest report from the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development. But the current gloom about the
economy is justified: revised government figures show that the recession in
France is significantly more severe than was previously forecast.
The Statistical Institute had been counting on gross domestic product growth
of 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, to give overall growth
for 1991 of 1.4 per cent. However, the latest figures show that the economy
was flat in the fourth quarter, and that the final figure for growth in 1991
was barely 1 per cent.
The rising trend of the unemployment figures is an increasing preoccupation
for a government facing the prospect of a severe rebuff in next month's
regional elections, and the near-certainty of defeat in the general
elections a year from now.
During September, October and November the unemployment figures rose
steeply. And though the rate of increase appeared to slow significantly in
December, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate at the turn of the year
was equivalent to 9.8 per cent of the workforce, compared with 9.1 per cent
in 1990.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, recently said: 'We shall avoid 3m
unemployed in 1992.' But figures published yesterday show that unemployment
rose again in January, bringing the total to 2,860,000.
The Labour Ministry yesterday predicted that the number of job-seekers would
decline, in crude terms, in coming months. But the unadjusted unemployment
figures are already up to 2,965,617, only a whisker short of the politically
fateful figure of 3m despite three government-sponsored job creation
packages in less than a year.
If the recession has a silver lining, it is the continued decline in
inflation and a sharp improvement in the trade figures. The 0.1 per cent
increase in the retail price index in December brought the overall increase
for 1991 to 3.1 per cent. This was not just an improvement on the previous
two years (3.4 per cent in 1990 and 3.6 per cent in 1989), but also a better
performance than in most of France's neighbours, including Germany (4.2 per
cent), Netherlands (4.9), Italy (6.5) and Switzerland (5.3).
The improved competitiveness of the French economy has been reflected in a
sharp recovery in the trade figures. Last year the total trade deficit fell
from just under FFr50bn (Pounds 5.09bn) to just over FFr30bn (Pounds
3.05bn). The trade deficit in civil industrial goods fell from nearly
FFr86bn in 1990 to just over FFr49bn in 1991.
France has also made a spectacular turn-around in its trade balance with the
rest of the European Community, from a deficit of FFr39bn in 1990 to a small
surplus of FFr2bn in 1991.
The positive trend in the trade balance was confirmed yesterday with figures
for January, showing a surplus of FFr3.6bn, compared with a deficit of
FFr2.7bn in December.
The recession has, however, blown the government's budgetary strategy off
course. Last year it managed to stay pretty well within its planned spending
limits, but tax receipts collapsed. As a result, the Finance Ministry says
the 1991 budget out-turn will be FFr123bn, compared with a target of
FFr80bn.
The knock-on effect of the tax short-fall is that it is doubtful whether the
government can stay within its 1992 planned budget deficit of FFr90bn. Here
the critical unknown factor is the timing of the recovery.
The most recent forecast by the Statistical Office pointed to an annual
growth rate of 2 per cent during the first half of this year. This was
broadly consistent with the calculations of the OECD, which forecast a rate
of 1.9 per cent in the first half, accelerating to 2.4 per cent in the
second.
However, both these predictions were made in December, before the depth of
the recession was fully known. Moreover, the record suggests that France
needs a growth rate of at least 2 per cent to stabilise unemployment and of
3 per cent to bring it down. It is not surprising, therefore, that the OECD
forecasts unemployment will continue to rise this year, before stabilising
at slightly over 10 per cent; not surprising, but very uncomfortable for a
Socialist government.

Tension rose in Bosnia Hercegovina yesterday after a bomb injured 12 people
and damaged a building housing a Croat cultural centre in the northern town
of Odzaci, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade.
The explosion late on Monday threatened to damage relations between the
Slavic Moslems, Serbs, and Croats who make up the Yugoslav republic's
population, just days before this weekend's referendum on independence.
Moslems, who make up 41 per cent of the 4.4m population, are expected to
vote for independence. Croats - 17 per cent of the population - mostly
support independence although ultra-nationalists want Bosnia to join
Croatia.

FT  26 FEB 92 / German companies see worse to come
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE first time in three years, more German companies expect business
conditions to get worse than to get better.
On the other hand, an overwhelming majority consider that the economic
situation is good, or at least satisfactory. Investment intentions remain
absolutely balanced between companies planning an increase and those
intending to cut back.
These were the key conclusions of the bi-annual survey of business opinion
of the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHT), published yesterday,
which confirmed the growing pessimism in the economy after two remarkable
growth years.
'The economy in Germany is taking a pause for breath,' according to Dr Franz
Schoser, chief executive of the chamber. 'But in spite of a clear weakening,
there are still no symptoms of a recession.' In spite of that, he admitted
that there had been a 'slump' in business confidence.
The survey covers more than 20,000 enterprises in west Germany, and some
4,000 in the east. It concludes that 25 per cent think the economy will get
better, 27 per cent that it will get worse, and 48 per cent that it will
remain much the same. Those figures compare with 40 per cent expecting an
improvement, and only 13 per cent a worsening, one year ago.
Key elements in the grimmer mood include the lack of impulse from exports,
and the fact that the extraordinarily high consumer demand at the time of
German unification is falling back. Another reason for pessimism, the survey
suggests, is the high level of wage demands from trade unions, as well as
rising inflation, high interest rates and increased tax and social security
payments.
There is still a sharp contrast in the expectations of businessmen in the
two halves of the country: in the east, where economic activity collapsed in
the wake of unification, there is a pick up. Forty-six per cent of
enterprises expect an improvement in their economic situation, against 42
per cent expecting no change, and only 12 per cent expecting further
deterioration. The mood is clearly more optimistic among small and
medium-sized enterprises than in the big businesses, Mr Schoser said.
The surprising conclusion is how many businesses in the west still consider
the economic situation 'good': no fewer than 38 per cent, while a further 48
per cent consider it satisfactory, and only 14 per cent poor.
As far as investment plans are concerned, the boom of the past three years
has clearly ended, leaving plans steady, but not falling. The principal
motive for investment is rationalisation, the DIHT says, and not expansion.
Environmental protection is also a growing reason for investment, regardless
of the economic climate.
The survey shows some stark differences between business sectors in their
assessment of the economic climate. Thus only 29 per cent of enterprises in
the investment goods industries think their situation is good (against 51
per cent last year.)
The sharpest slump in mood is in the machine engineering sector, while there
is more optimism in electronic industries, precision engineering, and
optics.
The attitude is more cheerful in consumer goods, food industries, wholesale
and retail trade, transportation, and above all in construction, where there
was the least deterioration. In the building industry, for example, 39 per
cent still saw the situation as 'good', and 53 per cent as 'satisfactory'.

Divisions within the Bundesbank over plans for European economic and
monetary union resurfaced yesterday with an outspoken attack on the
Maastricht treaty by a regional member of the bank's ruling council, writes
Quentin Peel in Bonn.
Mr Wilhelm Nolling, president of the Hamburg state central bank, warned in a
newspaper article that currency union could be 'abortive and premature,'
posing risks for monetary stability in Germany itself.
He singled out a series of 'indispensable' preconditions laid down by the
Bundesbank, and not fulfilled in the Emu agreement. The most important, he
said, was that Emu should not be tied to a rigid timetable, but that
transition to each further phase should depend 'on the fulfilment of
economic pre-conditions laid down clearly in advance.'
As for the economic convergence criteria themselves, and the possibility of
sanctions being imposed on member states for failing to observe them, he
questioned whether they amounted to 'adequate precautions to ensure an
effective budget discipline.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC's internal market commissioner, Mr Martin Bangemann, yesterday warned
Germany's Bundesbank to mind its own business and stop interfering with the
Commission's attempts to establish a barrier-free single market.
The Bundesbank commented in its report last week that completion of the
single market by the January 1, 1993 deadline was not assured.
'I don't deny that there's a certain connection between the success of the
internal market and the possibility of creating a common currency,' said Mr
Bangemann after yesterday's meeting of internal market ministers. But he
added that the Bundesbank should not try to judge what the Commission was
doing: 'Everybody should keep an eye on their own cows,' he said.
Mr Bangemann, Germany's senior commissioner, is himself a stern critic of
member states' sluggishness in implementing single market legislation and
abolishing frontier controls.
At yesterday's meeting he again put pressure on EC countries to accelerate
the removal of internal barriers, although he indicated that there was no
immediate need for a single regulation to sweep away all remaining border
controls on goods. Mr Bangemann said he hoped compromise proposals under
discussion would enable Britain, which is reluctant to lift border-checks on
people, to drop controls.
Mr Bangemann also praised some EC countries for improved implementation of
EC single market directives. For example, Italy - repeatedly criticised by
the Commission for not transforming EC directives into national law quickly
enough - has leapt from bottom of the Community league table to fifth in
less than a month. The back-markers are now the three Benelux countries,
although they argued yesterday that they were about to implement a number of
EC directives.
The third non-life insurance directive, which will enable consumers to buy
non-life insurance policies from companies anywhere in the EC from mid-1994,
was formally agreed by ministers yesterday.
Socialist MEPs, objecting to neglect of the single market's social aspect,
had been blocking the directive in the European Parliament but lifted this
last procedural obstacle two weeks ago.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Banks 'face Soviet debt moratorium': Balance of payments
crisis threatens repayments by republics, Salomon Brothers warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN commercial banks face the 'almost certain prospect' of a moratorium
on principal debt repayments by the former Soviet republics throughout this
year, according to a report by Salomon Brothers, the New York-based merchant
bankers.
This is because the republics are more preoccupied with their own domestic
problems and are suspicious of Russia's role in negotiating the debt.
Even if the political circumstances were more favourable, the report argues
that a moratorium would still be likely because the former Soviet republics
face a balance of payments crisis.
Under the terms of an inter-republican agreement signed last December,
western official creditors agreed to a temporary moratorium on medium and
long-term official debt.
This was followed by a temporary moratorium on payment of principal to
commercial banks. A moratorium on official credits was extended to the end
of 1992.
This agreement, which committed each republic towards contributing a share
of the convertible currency needed to make debt-service payments, was a
precondition for assent by official creditors to an extension of the
principal moratorium for all of this year.
Salomon Brothers say that the agreement is almost impossible to implement,
because:
'there is no way to ensure that each republic will contribute to the
debt-service pool, even if they had access to convertible currency income';
'all the republics, particularly the Ukraine, are suspicious of the (banking
and financial) apparatus that appears to be under the control of the Russian
republic.'
In recent weeks, the Ukraine government has repeatedly stated its opposition
to channeling debt service through a Russian-controlled institution.
'although the G7 (group of industrialised countries) warned the constituent
republics that their specific creditworthiness would be harmed if the debt
is not fully serviced, it is doubtful if the political elite in many
republics are overly concerned with international creditworthiness at a time
when popular discontent with food prices and shortages is the major
concern'.
Apart from political instability and inter-republican disagreements, the
report shows how balance-of-payments crises, caused by the rapid rise in
inflation, budget deficits, and an increase in the money supply, undermined
the worth of the rouble.
'The fundamental source of the Soviet Union's balance-of-payments crisis in
1991 was the rapid rise in both suppressed and open inflation during the
year, and the resulting disappearance of the rouble as a valid medium for
economic transactions,' says the report.
The public's lack of confidence in the rouble led to the internal flight to
hard currency by households - estimated to be between Dollars 5bn and
Dollars 10bn; the capital flight of hard currency abroad, estimated between
15bn and Dollars 40bn; and the hoarding abroad of hard currency by Soviet
enterprises in order to avoid the 40 per cent conversion tax on convertible
currency remissions.
The report argues that it is unlikely that the country's balance-of-payments
problems can be rectified in 1992.

FT  26 FEB 92 / S African Conservatives urged to reject reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa's pro-apartheid Conservative party yesterday urged its
supporters to reject political reform, and vote 'no' in next month's
whites-only referendum.
Mr Andries Treurnicht, the Conservative leader, said the party's leadership
had wished to boycott the poll but rank and file members had outvoted them.
The party met for several hours on Monday night and all day yesterday to
resolve the dispute over participation.
Mr Treurnicht, announcing the start of the 'no' campaign in a radio
broadcast, referred several times to the possibility that the Conservatives
might lose the referendum, an outcome which would have grave political
consequences for the party.
'If we lose, this is not the end of the political war in South Africa,' he
said, adding, 'there is still a white nation that cannot be wished away.'
Asked whether his party expected to win the poll, Mr Treurnicht said only
that victory would be 'difficult, but it is possible'.
The Conservatives cannot count on a united right wing front in the
referendum campaign, which may also explain their reluctance to participate.
Yesterday Mr Eugene Terre Blanche, leader of the largest right wing splinter
group, the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB), or Afrikaner
Resistance Movement, said it would do all in its power to stop South
Africa's 3m whites voting in the poll.
'We cannot allow them to be led to the slaughter like lambs,' said the AWB
leader, who shares Conservative party demands for a return to apartheid and
creation of an all-white state, but supports the violence which the
Conservatives eschew.
He threatened violent resistance, saying blacks, who outnumber whites by
five to one, 'have declared war on your property rights . . . We are going
to have war.'
The referendum is a political gamble by Mr FW de Klerk, the president and
leader of the ruling National party, to marginalise the Conservatives.
He has challenged them to prove that they represent the majority of whites,
but has phrased the referendum question so that all but the most committed
racists will support it - including not only members of his party but also
supporters of the liberal Democratic party.
If they lose, the Conservatives will be left with little constitutional
outlet for their opposition, with only 42 seats in a parliament dominated by
102 National party MPs.
If Mr de Klerk loses the referendum, he will resign and call a general
election, which the Conservatives could expect to win on a pro-apartheid
ticket.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (11): Post-war battle for market share -
Telecommunications
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT'S Ministry of Telecommunications faces a dilemma: should it repair
and update the country's wrecked telecoms network or should it throw the lot
out and start from scratch.
The former would be cheaper and it might be all the network needs. The
latter might be a better long-term bet, particularly as the government gears
up to privatisation in the next few years.
A choice between the two is essentially what is on offer from the two main
protagonists in the post-war battle for market share, Ericsson of Sweden,
and AT&amp;T of the US. The government could take a mix of suppliers, although
dealing with three or four separate operators and systems would require
different spare parts and technical expertise.
Damage to the country's telecoms network was immense. It is likely to cost
the government about Dollars 400m to repair and modernise the network. The
work will take two to three years to complete. Temporary work on the system
has restored domestic and international phone links, but the network is only
'limping along', as one telecoms company puts it.
AT&amp;T moved swiftly into the breach to patch up the system in the early days
after the war. Now it is hoping to build its market share at the expense of
Ericsson, which had just over 90 per cent of the pre-war market.
It is likely that AT&amp;T is looking to supply about a third to a half of the
post-war market. A third big operator, Alcatel, of France, is also a likely
contender for a large chunk of the market.
AT&amp;T has enjoyed only a short relationship with the Telecoms Ministry but it
has built a lot of good will in that time.
It provided a new exchange and international lines via a US satellite within
weeks of the war ending, enabling the first post-war international phone
calls.
Ericsson, on the other hand, has a relationship going back several decades
and the ministry says it has been more than happy with the service.
The company also carried out immediate repairs to exchanges immediately
after the war and its engineers are training Kuwaiti technicians to continue
maintenance of the network.
The Swedish company says that its old electro-mechanical equipment will have
to be fully replaced, but that its second-generation AXE advanced exchanges,
many of which were built in the late 1970s and early 1980s, can be fully
updated.
'There is no point in the Kuwaiti government spending too much money on what
they don't need,' says Mr Rolf Hedenstrom, Ericsson's technical manager in
Kuwait.
AT&amp;T says more radical surgery is necessary and wants to modernise the whole
network virtually from scratch, with AT&amp;T equipment.
Mr Abdul Aziz Al-Ayoub, under-secretary at the Telecoms Ministry, says that
both companies have as good a chance as any when the big contracts come up
for tender.
Some of the contracts to replace or repair 11 of the country's 28 exchanges
have been awarded, but a large part of the government's investment over the
next few years has still to be awarded.
The impetus for modernisation has been driven not only by war damage, but
also by the government's plans for privatisation. It wants to modernise the
network over the next two years before it floats the new company.
This includes conversion to a fully - digitalised system - about half the
network still operates on the old analogue technology.
Among the contracts awarded so far:
GPT of the UK has supplied its System X system in a deal worth about Dollars
6m to replace of one of four transit tandem stations at South Sabahiya. This
connects the south with the rest of the country. GPT is also supplying an
initial 200 pay phones for nearly Dollars 1m.
Alcatel of France has won a Dollars 8.57m contract to supply equipment to
four switching stations. It is also supplying Dollars 4.2m in fibre optics
and a Dollars 4.06m microwave system to link the switching centres.
Sprint, of the US, is supplying value added networks, including electronic
mail and conferencing.
TCIL, the Indian telecoms consultancy, is to repair and replace Dollars 6m
worth of telephones and cables.
Ericsson and AT&amp;T have both swept up various contracts in addition to
immediate repairs and maintenance. Ericsson is going ahead with a pre-war
contract to provide a mobile phones system of up to 30,000 lines.
AT&amp;T has also squeezed into the private market. The company says it is now
supplying 80 per cent of the country's post-war PABX private exchanges to
Kuwaiti hotels and businesses.
The deals so far are small beer against the investment to come and Kuwait's
rival suitors may be just warming up for a long and difficult courtship.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (10): Heroics speed recovery / A report on
the oil industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING the days of soot-laden skies last summer it appeared inconceivable
that Kuwait should not only have extinguished all 727 of its burning oil
wells, but be on target to restore production to pre-war levels by the end
of 1992.
However, as the emirate's rivals-cum-fellows in Opec know only too well,
Kuwait is firmly on course to pumping more than 1.5m barrels a day (b/d) of
oil - its last Opec quota - by the year's end, thanks largely to the
engineering heroics of the international coalition of fire-fighting teams
which doused the last blazing well in early November.
The subsequent restoration of output, which began in June last year, is
accelerating well ahead of a targeted rate of 50,000 b/d a month. Output
next month, says Mr Homoud al Rqobah, the oil minister, will be 710,000b/d,
including the emirate's 150,000 b/d share of output from the joint
Kuwaiti-Saudi Arabian neutral zone, and will hit 920,000 b/d by June.
To some extent, this speedy restoration is possible because, despite the
graphic horror of the blazing wells, oil engineers have discovered that a
good number of Kuwait's total of 1,080 wells are more or less serviceable.
Mr al Rqobah has said that 65 per cent of the Iraqi-detonated wellheads can
be readily repaired, while more than 100 wells survived the Iraqis
completely intact. Present output is being achieved from just over 120
wells. Repairs on up to 60 of the least-damaged wells in the southern Burgan
field, Kuwait's biggest, are taking as little as two-10 days each.
Bechtel, the private US engineering group, is co-ordinating the recovery in
the southern fields as part of its open-ended contract with the Kuwait Oil
Company (KOC), while the Kuwait British Group, a consortium of AMEC, Wimpey
and Taylor Woodrow from the UK, are repairing the pipelines and gathering
stations in the main northern fields.
Some re-drilling has already begun and, again, the Oil Ministry is
optimistic that this will present few problems, particularly given the
friendly geology of the main Burgan and Wafra fields where oil lies close to
the surface beneath uniformly soft rock. Some 28 wells have already been
re-drilled in the southern fields, each taking little more than 12 to 15
days each. Such drilling as will be necessary in the north, where none has
yet begun, is likely to take one or two months per well, given the region's
tougher and more complex geology.
KOC has so far commissioned Santa Fe, the Kuwait-owned engineering group, to
co-ordinate the drilling programme, with a target of 100 new wells sunk by
the end of June and perhaps a further 200 over the next two years.
The government aims to restore output capacity to at least 2m b/d by late
1993, compared with sustainable capacity of 2.5m b/d before the war, and is
hinting that it may consider increasing this capacity eventually towards at
least 3m b/d. However, its present thinking is to hold production at a
ceiling of about 1.6m b/d-1.7m b/d, once it is attained, for six months.
This would enable studies into possible damage to the reservoirs caused by
the well fires. 'We're like a man just recovering from a disease,' says Mr
Rqobah. 'We need time to recover.'
To date only superficial studies into reservoir damage have been conducted,
although oil engineers report that oil pressure in wells already functioning
in the the southern fields is unchanged from pre-war levels.
However, some analysts, including the local Al-Shall economic agency, have
suggested that the race to restore output is drawing damaging amounts of
water into the oil reservoirs - a charge disputed by the Oil Ministry. 'Our
studies show that there is no problem with the reservoirs up to 1.5m b/d or
1.7m b/d; after that we will have to wait and see,' says Mr Rqobah.
Restoring Kuwait's downstream operations, however, appears to be proceeding
with much less urgency and some western diplomats suggest that the necessary
steps to mend the country's refining capacity and revive its petrochemical
ambitions may be hampered by bureaucratic cramp.
Short-listed contractors for the management contract to oversee full repairs
to the country's three refineries - favourites among which are Foster
Wheeler, Fluor Daniel and Brown &amp; Root of the US - have been waiting since
early last Autumn for a final decision, which government officials say is
due any week now. The government is nevertheless expecting to restore
650,000 b/d of refining capacity, from a pre-war ceiling of 730,000 b/d, by
early next year.
Early repairs made under Bechtel's auspices have revived 170,000 b/d of
capacity at Mina Ahmadi and 100,000 b/d at Mina Abdulla - enough to meet
Kuwait's domestic power and petrol needs. Shuaiba, which was severely
damaged by the Iraqis, remains moribund for now.
The government has also, through the state-owned Petroleum Industries
Corporation, suggested it wants to proceed with a pre-war Dollars 2.5bn
project to build a petrochemicals export plant at Shuaiba, with a 750,000
tonnes-a-year ethane cracker. No formal tender for the project, which may be
slightly modified from original proposals, is expected for several months,
however.
The overall cost of Kuwait's oil reconstruction programme, which aside from
its ambitions in defence procurement make up the biggest slice of its total
reconstruction bill, is still the subject of informed guesswork -
particularly since no-one appears able to assess exactly what Bechtel's
clearly lucrative deal with Kuwait will finally amount to.
Mr Rqobah says the oil fires cost Dollars 2bn to extinguish, including the
purchase of Dollars 600m worth of heavy equipment which will be resold in
what amounts to a spectacular boot sale. He has puts the industry's total
reconstruction bill, over the next three years, at Dollars 10bn-Dollars
15bn, although external government and industry observers suggest the final
figure may be little more than Dollars 8bn, including the emirate's
petrochemicals plan.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (9): Lots of uncertainties - Compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADEL OMAR ASEM has got the longest job title in Kuwait. He is probably one
of the country's busiest people.
His desk is awash with paper. His telephone is ringing. He signs another
document and takes a sip of tea. 'I will be more than happy when this is all
over,' he says.
Mr Asem is director-general of the Public Authority for the Assessment of
Compensation for Damages Resulting from Iraqi Aggression. It is called PAC
for short.
The agency was set up in November last year to assemble Kuwait's claim
against Iraq for damage and loss during the war. It is an enormous and
bureaucratic operation that will take about two years to complete.
On February 15, Mr Asem's department sent out 600,000 claim forms. That is
roughly one for every Kuwaiti citizen. Foreign businesses and expatriates
seeking damages must file claims through their embassies or national
authorities.
This first batch of forms in Kuwait represents Phase 1 of the operation. It
covers individual and personal loss and injury. Phase 2, which is scheduled
to start in April or May, covers corporate and government claims.
It is likely to be the biggest ever claim against a single country.
'Kuwait's oil losses alone could amount to Dollars 40bn-Dollars 45bn,' says
Mr Asem. 'Oil is the biggest component, but there has been speculation that
the total could be as high as Dollars 100bn to Dollars 200bn.'
More conservative estimates put the likely total at around Dollars 40bn,
about half of which is accounted for by oil losses. This includes production
lost during and after the Iraqi occupation and the cost of repairs to oil
wells and installations.
Aside from war damage, there was widespread and systematic looting of
private homes and businesses. About 50,000 cars were stolen, the gold souk
(market) in Kuwait City was stripped and an estimated Dollars 360m worth of
gold bars and foreign currency was taken from Kuwait's central bank
Computers went from offices, books from schools, incubators from hospitals
and spare parts from cars and factories.
The reparations process is governed by the United Nations, which will
scrutinise the final claims package. In all, the UN is expecting to receive
2m individual Kuwaiti claims.
Each of Kuwait's government ministries is likely to file a claim. 'Most of
the telecoms stations, switches, satellite equipment and so on were totally
destroyed,' says Mr Asem. 'There isn't a single school that hasn't been
destroyed or looted. Power substations and water facilities, museums,
hospitals and libraries have all been damaged in some way. Business claims
include damage and looting as well as lost earnings and opportunities. Small
businesses suffered greatly.'
Western loss adjustors, financial experts and lawyers are advising PAC on
the claim before it is submitted to the UN, which will make the final demand
against Iraq.
Last year, the Kuwaiti government awarded the lucrative claims management
contract to the US arm of accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick. The firm won
the contract - worth tens of millions of dollars  - against competition from
one of its own affiliates, KPMG Peat Marwick of the UK, which had put
together a consortium bidding for the whole package.
'It caused a bit of a stir on both sides of the Atlantic,' according to a
western observer in Kuwait City. 'It is such a big firm that apparently the
right hand didn't know what the left was doing.'
Legal advisers on the claim are Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton of the
US, and Clifford Chance of London, which was originally part of the UK
consortium.
KPMG's staff of 90 in Kuwait City share offices with PAC, which will employ
about 370 people at the height of the operation.
Firms will be asked to submit new tenders for the second phase covering
corporate and government damages.
The claim is split, under UN guidelines, into six categories: individual
expenses and losses incurred through departure from Kuwait after the
invasion; death and injury; personal and private loss of less than Dollars
100,000; personal and private loss of more than Dollars 100,000; corporate
claims; and government claims. The Kuwaiti authorities, and any other
national governments seeking damages, have 18 months from January this year
to submit their claims, although the UN is likely to be flexible about the
deadline because of the size of the task.
The UN has stipulated that claims made by private individuals should be
processed first because of the scale of personal hardship. In particular,
the Security Council has said that foreign nationals, most of whom lost
everything overnight as they fled Kuwait, should be the first to get money
from the UN's proposed compensation fund.
Putting together the Kuwaiti claim will cost the government about Dollars
50m-Dollars 60m, money it hopes to recoup from the UN fund.
Soon after the war, the Security Council told Baghdhad it would supervise
Iraqi oil sales to ensure that 30 per cent of the revenues went directly
into the war damages fund. Iraq is refusing to accept the UN plan. Even if
Iraq pays into the fund it is likely to be several decades before all claims
are paid.
'We have received assurances from the UN Security Council on the principle
that Iraq, as the aggressor, should be made to pay,' says Mr Asem. 'That
does not mean we can all sleep comfortably. There are still lots of
uncertainties about whether Iraq will pay into the fund.'
But he is sanguine about the outcome. 'This is not simply a matter of
compensation. It is documentation for future generations. It is hard to make
any kind of judgment about whether or not we get all the compensation we
want, but this operation is something for the future.'

FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (8): A lucrative operation - Sheila Jones
joins ordnance clearance experts in the desert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'TREAD in my footsteps. There should be no mines here but I'd rather not
take the risk.'
Paddy Blagden leaves a trail of large footprints in the sand. This is the
southern triangle of Kuwait, about 1,500 sq km of desert stretching from the
outskirts of Kuwait City down to the Saudi border. It is alive with mines,
unexploded bombs and live ammunition.
Mr Blagden is in charge of the British team making safe the second-largest
of Kuwait's six sectors, divided up for clearance after the war.
Iraqi soldiers laid millions of mines across the desert. Crates of live
ammunition are piled up at Iraqi dug-outs alongside anti-aircraft guns.
Unexploded Rockeye bomblets are strewn about. On a southern desert road
about 50km from the Saudi border, a large, silvery bomb is up-ended in the
sand.
So far, only a few priority areas have been cleared: Kuwait City, the
northern beaches and, most importantly, the oilfields.
Kuwait City was littered with grenades and small ammunition. It was cleared
by the allied forces soon after the occupation ended but not before hundreds
of Kuwaitis, including many children, were killed and maimed by the
munitions left behind. It could be another two years before the whole
country is cleared.
It is a lucrative operation for the handful of ordnance companies and the
many subcontractors that have won the clear-up contracts. And it is the
first time such work has been handed over to private companies.
Royal Ordnance, the British Aerospace subsidiary, was awarded the contract
to clear the British sector by the Kuwaiti government last year. The
contract, which also includes part of Kuwait City, the beaches, oilfields
and Failaka island off the north-east coast, is thought to be worth about
Dollars 100m.
The biggest contract - worth about Dollars 200m - was awarded a few months
ago to Conventional Munitions Systems of the US against competition from
three other US companies, UXB, States International and Olin Ordnance. CMS
is still mobilising its team for the US sector and it has yet to start the
clearance.
The British, French and US authorities are responsible for the three most
heavily-mined sectors in central, southern and western Kuwait. The
government has contracted the Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Egyptian
authorities to make safe the three sectors in the north and north-west.
Bangladeshi soldiers are also conducting quality assurance sweeps of areas
that have been cleared.
Royal Ordnance was the first to win a clearance contract and by February
this year it was the only company to have started work.
'We were required to act quickly because of the oilfields,' says Mr Blagden.
'The big priority in Kuwait was to get revenue coming in again. Before any
firefighters were able to get to any burning well head, the access to that
well head had to be cleared. It was an appallingly difficult job.'
The oil wells were ablaze, belching out dense black smoke, fumes and hot oil
droplets. The surrounding desert was a mass of oil lakes and congealed sand.
'It was what I imagine hell to be like.'
The company started work on the oilfields in May and access to all the wells
was cleared in time for the last oil fire to be put out in November. The
contract was the subject of hefty overrun penalties. Royal Ordnance has also
cleared a 27-kilometre stretch of northern beaches down to the port of
Shuaibah. These were fortified with trenches and barbed wire entanglements
strewn with anti-personnel mines.
Royal Ordnance has subcontracted the land reinstatement work, such as
refilling cleared trenches, to Marr-Bell of the US.
Work started this month on the southern triangle which the company is
committed to finishing by the end of June. Here, the Iraqis laid 84 linear
kilometres of mines which stretch out in neat rows as far as the eye can
see. In all, there are about 1m mines to be cleared, a mix of anti-tank
mines and the small, spiked anti-personnel mines known as Bouncing Bettys
(the Valmara V-69. It jumps two feet in the air on impact, then explodes).
Failaka Island was cleared by soldiers from the Royal Engineers under Royal
Ordnance contract last year.
Now deserted and without power and water, the island was used as an Iraqi
military base. It used to be a smart holiday spot for Kuwaiti day trippers.
About 550 families lived there.
Most of Failaka's buildings and installations are badly damaged and looted.
Some are scattered with Iraqi equipment: maps, a radio transmitter and
remnants of military uniforms.
In one house, a recently installed bathroom suite is intact. Toys, books,
clothing, crockery and family photographs are in heaps on the floor.
The only people on the island now are the ordnance and reconstruction
workers.
Virtually all the men working on Kuwait's clearance are ex-military,
employed on short-term contracts. Many are former combat engineers and
explosives experts.
In the past six months, Royal Ordnance has laid off about 100 British
workers and recruited Gurkha engineers at about half the wages.
The company says the lay-offs were partly for commercial reasons. It adds
that all its current workers are qualified for the work they are doing.
It now employs 290 workers, against 440 six months ago.
Mr Steve Macpherson, a Glaswegian in his 30s, is on contract for Passive
Barriers, a UK explosive ordnance disposal company which has been operating
in Kuwait as a subcontractor since April last year.
'I came here mainly for the money,' he says. 'If I stay a full year I should
have about Pounds 30,000 to take home. It'll pay the mortgage.'
Mr Macpherson, a former mines instructor with the British army, has just
finished clearing Failaka harbour, dredging the water for stray bomblets and
hauling out battered pleasure boats.
'I'd rather be sifting this muck than unemployed at home,' he says.
Passive Barriers has picked up 20 or so small contracts, mainly clearing
areas to enable repairs and reconstruction.
It has cleared cable and pipeline areas, water pumping stations, ports,
buildings and private patches of land.
The company had hoped to get one of the large contracts to clear a whole
sector.
'We haven't done as well as I had hoped,' says Mr Brian Ashwell, Passive
Barrier's Kuwait director. 'The contracts have been worth thousands rather
than millions although it has been worth our while being here.'
Even with the clearance operation barely underway, a complicated network of
contractors and subcontractors has sprung up.
Some companies complain of a lack of central control and regulation.
'There should have been a centralised operation and there wasn't,' says Mr
Blagden. 'I think the Kuwaiti MoD decided it would be expensive and was not
really necessary.
'There is relatively little control over the way in which ammunition, in
particular, is removed from Iraqi positions and stored. It's extremely
dangerous.'
There have been several explosions at central munitions dumps (but no deaths
or serious injuries) and there is likely to be growing pressure from
clearance companies for central regulation as more operators start work in
the months ahead.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (7): 'Backstop role' for the west - Defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON

<TEXT>
KUWAIT signed a military co-operation agreement with Britain this month,
similar to a 10-year pact agreed earlier with the US. A deal with France,
the third active western member of the Desert Storm coalition will follow
soon.
None of these agreements - as each government is keen to emphasise -
includes any wording committing the three allies to the automatic defence of
Kuwait in the event of further aggression against the emirate. But that is
not entirely the way Kuwait prefers to interpret these pacts. 'Let's just
say their perception is a bit stronger than ours,' says an official from one
signatory country.
The two deals so far signed, and the French one to follow, are essentially
undertakings to conduct joint manoeuvres with the Kuwaitis, offer increased
training to Kuwaiti forces and co-ordinate arms sales packages. The US pact
also includes provisions to pre-position tanks, armoured personnel carriers
and artillery in Kuwait.
No one is in any doubt that Kuwait, which lacks either strategic depth or
sufficient manpower for a substantial army, would have finally to rely on
western assistance to repel another outright attack. But the western powers
are determined that Kuwait should not read this an excuse not to, first,
steel its own domestic forces and second, to weld itself more effectively
than before the war into a collective Gulf security arrangement.
Kuwait has, in fact, made a priority of rebuilding its armed forces, which
were left depleted, disorganised and demoralised by Iraq's swift invasion. A
full reorganisation of the forces will be made following completion of a
detailed US study to be presented to the Defence Ministry this month.
While details of the reorganisation, and therefore of the the army's
procurement needs, await the results of this study, it is already plain what
will be required of Kuwait's rebuilt force: that it should be able to resist
an aggressor for long enough to allow foreign reinforcements to arrive.
In practice, this would amount to holding out against Iraqi forces - which
remain the likeliest longer-term threat to Kuwait - for two or three days.
'If the army could hold out for seven days, it would be incredible,'
comments one defence analyst.
But even this circumscribed ambition will require substantial work to
achieve. To begin with, Kuwait must somehow find the manpower to fill an
army which before the war boasted 20,000 men under arms, but which has
slumped since to about half this figure following the government's decision
to disbar on grounds of questionable loyalty some 10,000 Bidoun, or
stateless Arabs, who had made up the bedrock of the ground troops.
The Defence Ministry optimistically aims to build a total force of 30,000,
partly by insisting more vigorously than before the war that Kuwaitis
actually perform their formally obligatory 18 months' national service - an
obligation most Kuwaiti males have hitherto managed to circumvent. Although
the government wants an army purely of Kuwaiti citizens - and at least 1,000
Kuwaitis have been recruited since liberation - a small number of Bidoun
are, out of necessity, being readmitted into the force.
As part of the government's professed desire to see its forces armed with
the latest and highest technology, Kuwait's ground forces will almost
certainly purchase either Abrahams M1A2 tanks from the US or the British
Challenger II, but a decision on which or how many is not expected until
later this year. Defence analysts say estimates that Kuwait may purchase 200
tanks are, for now, broad guesses.
Kuwait's airforce has already received three of the 40 F-18 jets ordered
from the US as part of a Dollars 1.6bn order originally made in 1988 to
replace the airforce's dated A4 Skyhawks and Mirage F1 aircraft.
Refurbished bases to accommodate these aircraft will be ready by the end of
this year. Earlier this year, the government awarded US companies contracts
to repair the emirate's two devastated airbases under an overall Dollars 81m
foreign military sales package. Morrison Knudsen Corporation is to rebuild
Ahmed al Jaber base, north of Kuwait City, in a Dollars 24m deal, while
George A Fuller and American International Contractors secured a Dollars
18.5m contract to restore the Al-Salem base, south of the city.
However, while revival of Kuwait's own forces is in train, much less
progress has been made towards securing what western governments insist
Kuwait must see as its second line of defence - its Gulf Co-operation
Council (GCC) allies.
A residual 'Peninsular Shield' force of two brigades, one from Saudi Arabia
and one from a mix of GCC countries, has remained in central and southern
Kuwait since the war. However, this small force falls far short of
representing the sort of Gulf security arrangement which the US and Britain
formally insist their own defence pacts should only 'underpin'.
Since the effective demise of the Damascus Declaration, which aimed after
the war to bond the six GCC states, Syria and Egypt into a joint Arab force,
GCC states have shuttled chiefs of staff around the region in an attempt to
construct some sort of strategic defence structure for the region.
So far, however, this has yielded little more fruit than a string of
studies.
Oman's suggestion of creating a pan-Gulf force of 100,000 remains
technically on the books but suffers from disagreements over command and
control structures - and the potentially fatal question of where the
thinly-populated Gulf states will find that many soldiers.
While Iraq remains strategically crippled and two US aircraft carriers
remain in or around the Gulf just in case, Kuwait and its GCC fellows have
time to mull over details of a joint arrangement.
Continuous US and British military manoeuvres in the Gulf, as part of the
joint military agreements, will also underline what western defence
officials prefer to call their 'backstop role'.
However, the US and Britain, in particular, are pressing Kuwait and the
other Gulf states hard to make a go of collective defence. Both governments
have also made a point of highlighting to Kuwait that whatever the immediate
threat from Iraq, no country in the Gulf should lose sight of the fact that
Iran has quietly been busy re-arming itself for the past year.
Iran's rearming may offer no immediate threat in itself, but as one military
expert puts it: 'In a year or two, no-one will be able to make a single
decision in the Gulf without considering the Iranian reaction.'
Given Iran's distaste for any western military presence in the region,
Britain and the US are seeking to impress on Kuwait that there may be a
longer-term political cost to being too overtly dependent on its western
protectors - not least to those protectors themselves.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (6): Many contracts still to be awarded / A
look at repairs to the electricity and water networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY camels are comfortable without air conditioning in Kuwait. Temperatures
are manageable at this time of year but in the summer, the country bakes.
The scorching heat of August will be the greatest test for the emirate's
patched-up power and water network.
Work so far has barely scratched the surface. Millions of dollars worth of
contracts are still to be awarded to make good the severe damage inflicted
during the seven-month Iraqi occupation. Repairs to the country's power
stations have restored about a third of their pre-war capacity of 7,200MW.
That is enough to meet the current load, but it is still short of the likely
surge in demand over the next six months.
'We have set a target to produce 5,000MW by August 24,' says Mr Ahmed
al-Adsany, minister of electricity and water. 'By then we estimate the peak
load will reach 3,300MW.'
Work on the power stations was especially urgent because they also provided
virtually all the country's domestic and industrial fresh water at combined
desalination plants.
The government says that 98 per cent of the country has been linked to power
and water supplies, although some farming areas in the north are still
without plumbed water. It is likely to be two to three years before the
network is fully up and running.
All six of Kuwait's power stations were damaged during the war. Early
estimates put the full cost of the repair work at about Dollars 1bn. Now the
government says it will have to spend Dollars 5bn on the network over the
next five years, including nearly Dollars 2bn for a new plant at Subiya in
north-east Kuwait.
Mitsubishi of Japan won the Subiya contract before the war but the project
was suspended after the invasion. The company will supply the boilers and
turbines, worth about Dollars 1bn. It is now negotiating with the government
which is trying to hold the company to prices agreed under the 1989
contract. A group of Turkish companies is building the plant's
infrastructure. Work is due to start in 1994.
Much of the post-war work has been to carry out urgent, but temporary,
repairs, and only a handful of the biggest contracts has been awarded.
Scores of western companies are battling for the spoils.
Bristol Babcock, the UK engineering company, has just completed an Dollars
8m contract to repair the control room at Doha West power station, built in
1983. The new control room was scheduled to be switched on today for the
first time since the war, operating initially at a tiny proportion of its
capacity.
The UK company is working on a similar Dollars 10.8m contract to repair the
control room and other items as the adjoining plant at Doha East, which was
built in 1977. Boilers were also badly damaged and most of the fuel tanks
were destroyed. Deutsche Babcock, which supplied the original boilers at the
two plants, won the order for new boilers. The government has reopened
bidding for a Dollars 20-Dollars 25m order for the new fuel tanks after
rejecting initial bids last year. FC Babcock, the group's French subsidiary,
appears to be a likely contender.
One of the biggest single contracts being negotiated is for the replacement
of desalination units at Shuwaikh. Estimates for the work range from Dollars
20m to Dollars 40m. The government says that damage to the power plant,
built in 1954, was so severe that it is not worth repairing. But the
desalination plant was only a few years old. The pre-war capacity of each of
Shuwaikh's three desalination units was 6m gallons of water a day, about a
sixth of the country's daily consumption.
Westinghouse of the US is chasing the Shuwaikh contract along with Hitachi
and Mitsubishi of Japan, Hyundai of South Korea, Alsthom of France and a
handful of smaller western companies. Westinghouse says it will enter a
joint venture with a civil engineering company, possibly Blount of the US,
if it wins the contract.
Temporary repairs have been carried out at two of the other power stations,
but the Shuaiba North plant is still out of action. Shuaiba South and the
al-Zour plant, Kuwait's newest power station, built in 1988, suffered little
damage. The two plants are supplying all Kuwait's current capacity.
Transmission cables to al-Zour have been patched up, along with about
10,000km of cable throughout the country.
Blount carried out temporary repairs to the cable network jointly with
subcontractors, local companies and government workers. Some of the
subcontracted work has gone to Balfour Beatty, on overhead repairs, and BICC
on ground cables.
The repairs have enabled the country to tick over, but the heavy investment
needed to bring the system up to full power has barely started.
The cable network was so extensively damaged that it will cost about Dollars
200m to put right.
Blount has just started work on a Dollars 15m contract to replace high
voltage overhead cables. A string of European, Japanese and US companies are
bidding for the rest of the cable work and for the outstanding contracts to
repair the country's 4,000 substations, about a third of which will have to
be fully replaced.
Several hundred substations have been repaired and equipment replaced by
Westinghouse in partnership with Blount. Trans-electro, of Hungary, which
built many of the original substations, has also carried out much of the
temporary repair work. The full tally of work is likely to reach Dollars
200m.
Power supplies were more severely disrupted than the flow of water. Early
repairs to the distribution system quickly secured enough water to satisfy
demand from the returning population.
Reservoirs, which suffered little damage, are back to pre-war storage levels
of about 2bn gallons.
Current demand of 90m gallons a day will rise to about 130m by the summer.
The two Doha plants and the al-Zour plant are now capable of producing 185m
gallons a day between them. Full capacity will be reached only when the
power stations are restored.
The destruction has at least given the government the impetus to upgrade the
system. Western engineers say the network needed repair anyway because of
poor maintenance over a long period.
The size of the final bill is forcing the government to look at ways of
reducing demand and cutting costs. Mr al-Adsany says the government is
considering a phased reduction of the heavy subsidies it pays on electricity
and water bills. It may also introduce higher peak-level charges.
The timing of such measures might be difficult. The government has promised
public sector pay rises of 25 per cent, but as Mr al-Adsany says: 'What we
give with one hand, we cannot take with the other.'

FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (4): A financial strait-jacket - The
Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN given the crippling effects of the Gulf war, Kuwait is scarcely a place
of slender means. The word 'austerity' need never cross the lips of
policymakers in a country of fewer than 1.5m people sitting on more than
94bn barrels of crude oil.
Nevertheless, the war took an expensive toll. Aside from the direct costs of
paying coalition allies some Dollars 22bn for waging the war, lost oil
revenues, the liquidation of billions of dollars' worth of assiduously
cultivated foreign assets and a reconstruction bill which may top Dollars
20bn, Kuwait's economy was also left in a distraught and disorganised mess.
The inevitable result will be to leave Kuwait's income heavily denuded over
the next few years and its expenses correspondingly inflated.
This year, however, is election year and Kuwait's government is determined
that voters will not fault it at the polls for its generosity. The
government's ability to cushion Kuwaitis, with more limited available means,
will be the policy test of the next year. The wisdom of its doing so rather
than adjusting Kuwaitis to a leaner economy is, however, likely to be a
matter of debate for some few years thereafter.
For the present, the government faces the task of balancing Kuwait's books.
In its provisional budget for 1992, still awaiting formal approval by the
National Council, the government estimates revenues will reach KD870m. Just
over 80 per cent of earnings will come from oil, output of which is likely
to be near pre-war levels of 1.5m barrels a day (b/d) by the year end.
Revenues will be about a third of pre-war income, which also included
earnings of KD1bn from the country's overseas investments, held in the
Reserve Fund for Future Generations which before the war was valued at
Dollars 65bn. However, local economists reckon that at least Dollars 30bn of
this has been liquidated to help cover war costs.
Government expenditure for 1992 is projected at KD6bn, a 67 per cent rise on
the last published budget in 1990, much of it accounted for by a 43 per cent
rise in expected defence spending to KD2.6bn. The resulting deficit is put
at KD5.3bn - although this figure excludes KD2.9bn of 'extraordinary'
war-related spending, including KD2bn of payments to Desert Storm allies and
at least KD500m for consumer debt write-offs after liberation and gratuities
to departing Palestinian civil servants.
The scale of the deficit prompted Kuwait to arrange a Dollars 5.5bn
syndicated loan late last year through J. P. Morgan. Treasury bill and bond
issues will also be used to make up the shortfall, together with drawings on
available reserves.
However, it is the prospect of future deficits which worry some local
economists, who argue that unless the government is far more savage in
cutting its expenditure, the country faces a highly expensive spiral of
accumulating deficits.
According to the Al-Shall economic consultancy in Kuwait, civil service
salary payments alone will consume 49 per cent of likely oil revenues for
1993 - which the consultancy estimates at about KD2.2bn, assuming exports of
1.4m b/d at an average price of Dollars 15 a barrel. Adding the cost of the
government's proposed buy-out of bank debts, that is to say interest payable
on bonds to be issue to the banks, will take this to 65 per cent of
projected revenues. 'Kuwait faces a real and extended deficit for a very
long time to come,' says Mr Jassem al Saddoun, Al Shall's managing director.
Given the high level of recurrent government expenditure, quite apart from
the tally of reconstruction costs, Mr al Saddoun says the government is
ill-placed to afford much in the way of pre-election bounties. Nevertheless,
in addition to the write-off of consumer loans, the government earlier this
month approved a 25 per cent rise in civil service salaries, adding a
further KD285m to its wage bill for 1992.
Behind such decisions lies the government's determination to ensure that
Kuwait's voters, when they tick ballot papers in October, return a tame and
government-friendly National Assembly. 'Economic decisions are, such as they
are, being taken for political rather than economic reasons,' says one
diplomat.
Other observers, including senior bankers and economists, privately voice
concern that they see no sign that the government is looking beyond the
October election to devise any sort of guiding economic policy for the rest
of the decade, beyond pumping as much oil as possible and banking on being
able to repay whatever short-term debts it may incur. 'My main worry is that
nobody is thinking at all,' confides one banker bleakly.
Such critics propose that the government should, for example, open the oil
and financial services sectors to overseas investors to encourage
efficiency, privatise what it can of its infrastructure and spread what it
can of less essential rebuilding costs over a decade rather than over the
next three or four years.
'It's a golden opportunity now to cut the fat and boost only areas where
Kuwait has a comparative advantage,' says one economist. The government is
clearly aware of the financial strait-jacket it will have to wear for the
next few years, and is cautiously looking at ways in which it can cut costs.
The option of raising revenues through income taxes, although some
opposition figures bravely suggest such things in private, is, as in most
other Gulf states, most unappetising.
Instead, the government is more likely to affect what cuts it can in the
high level of subsidies paid on public services. Cooper and Lybrand, for
example, has been commissioned to conduct a study into privatising parts of
the telecommunications industry although no moves on this are expected much
before the middle of 1993. The electricity ministry has also hinted that it
is looking at ways of reducing the huge subsidies on power: the average cost
of a kilowatt of Kuwaiti power is 20 fils, (there are 1,000 fils to the
dinar) towards which the consumer pays only about 2 fils.
In addition, despite the huge rise in overall government expenditure
outlined in the 1992 budget, the government has sought to cut spending in
most ministries by 20 per cent against the budgeted 1990 figure for each
department - although since the 1990 fiscal year was rudely interrupted,
this is a fuzzy target.
But critics of the government argue that such measures are no more than
prudent book-keeping and do not substitute for an overall economic strategy.
In particular, some economists argue, present policies portend a further
fattening of Kuwait's already flabby public sector with little incentive for
private enterprise.
At one level, the government's big pay award to the public sector has
already provided a further disincentive to Kuwaitis, 90 per cent of whom
already work for the government, from entering the private sector.
More crucially, however, the government has effectively dealt two reeling
blows to the private sector - and the Kuwaiti merchant families who run it -
by deciding first to slash the size of the emirate's post-war population
and, second, effectively to abandon all ambitions for Kuwait's non-oil
industrial and manufacturing sector.
The loss of 400,000 Palestinians, most of them long-settled families in
Kuwait, has already had a shattering effect on the market for some Kuwaiti
trade companies and will have a depressing knock-on effect on lending
opportunities for Kuwait's banks.
So far, the government has announced no formal policy towards the industrial
private sector but merchants and bankers are taking it as read that the
government has given up on what before the war had been heavily-supported
attempts to develop local industry. Although this in its way also cuts
government spending - and, some would argue, wasted spending, given the
indifferent performance of the small manufacturing sector before the Iraqi
invasion - it nevertheless closes off yet another part of the
fast-diminishing private sector.
This might not matter were it not for the fact that more than half of
Kuwait's population is under the age of 14 - meaning that the economy will
have to expand somehow to offer these young Kuwaitis jobs. In Mr Saddoun's
view, the result will be not just underemployment, already rife in Kuwait,
but real unemployment.
In the end, however, the government may simply decide that rather than
subsidise the private sector with oil revenues, creating what one local
economist calls 'fake industry', it will simply swell further the ranks of
the public sector. In which case, the only calculation about the Kuwait
economy which matters over the next few years is that for likely world oil
demand.
Starkly put, of course, this is perhaps the only economic calculation in
Kuwait which ever matters.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (5): Living in a short-term world - Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WITHIN a month, Kuwait's banks hope to be reborn. By then, the government
expects to have finalised a bold scheme to clear billions of dinars worth of
bad debts from their books by purchasing them itself in return for an
extraordinary sale of bonds.
The scheme - which is awaiting approval by the National Council, Kuwait's
interim political assembly, as this survey goes to print - would be one of
the biggest single write-offs of bank debt in history. It would also put
Kuwait's banks soundly on their own feet, with wholly clean balance sheets,
for the first time in a decade.
Since the informal Souq al Manakh stock market soared, only to crash, on a
spree of speculative share-buying based on post-dated cheques, residual
debts from the 1982 crisis have rendered all but one of Kuwait's banks
technically insolvent, propped up only by considerable central bank support.
Only the National Bank of Kuwait, Kuwait's biggest bank, has in the past few
years declared soundly-based trading profits.
The new plan would thus be the final chapter in the long and tangled tale of
the Souq al Manakh. It would also clear the banks of all their pre-war
debts, on the grounds that with many borrowers ill-equipped to repay them
due to post-war hardship, these debts too might turn bad.
The plan has a neat, once-and-for-all ring to it. Although the Kuwait
government already had in place the cumbersomely-titled Difficult Credit
Facilities Resettlement Programme to address the Souq al Manakh bad debts,
this had dragged on with mixed success throughout the 1980s. Now the
government has sought to take the extraordinary circumstances offered by the
war finally to grasp and uproot this troublesome nettle. In February, the
entire banking system was effectively on hold pending the scheme's final
approval.
But for a variety of reasons, Kuwaiti banks are awaiting their rebirth with
trepidation. For one thing, although they universally applaud such a
sweeping solution to their long-standing debt problems, they worry that the
plan may falter badly on its details. For another, few bankers are convinced
that post-war Kuwait will offer them a particularly prosperous second
childhood, for the first few years at least.
Although the details of the buy-out plan are still being debated by the
National Council, its outline is clear. The government is proposing to buy a
total of KD5.8bn of debt, 81 per cent of it owed to Kuwait's six main
commercial banks and the remainder to several finance houses, through a
one-off sale of government bonds. These bonds will pay interest at a rate to
be agreed, but which is to reflect the banks' average cost of funds -
expected to be 5-7 per cent, roughly the cost of banks' deposits.
The government will then formally take over the bad debts, KD1.9bn of which
reflects the legacy of Souq al Manakh and KD3.8bn pre-war bank lending -
embracing 6,258 debtors in all.
But while the banks will have the debts off their books, they will still be
expected to administer the rescheduling of these debts. Individual debtors
and companies will have 20 years to repay and a three-year grace-period. At
present, it seems likely that debtors will be expected to pay rates of
interest relative to their ability to pay. These rates will be set after an
evaluation of their assets or cashflow.
But this is where bankers start feeling queasy. Although it makes sense that
the banks' credit departments, which by now have a 10-year-old relationship
with some of the Souq al Manakh debtors, should administer the debts, this
solution also means that the banks will have to maintain the costly and
labour-intensive debt management departments dedicated to these bad debts.
Moreover, since the debts would formally be off their books, the banks have
less incentive to chase up the debts as vigorously as before. 'It's like
asking the banks to collect taxes on the government's behalf,' says one
banker. 'Where's the incentive in that? It only hurts our relationship with
our customers.'
In addition, many bankers argue that the new plan shares a flaw in the
original settlement programme by seeking to tailor interest rates on the
rescheduled debts to the debtor's revealed ability to pay. This, they say,
is an incentive for debtors to hide the full extent of their assets and, in
the case of many of the bigger debtors, to keep their wealth out of the
country altogether.
For these reasons, many bankers and economists would prefer a blanket
rescheduling package whereby all repayed debts remained interest free.
However, there is a widespread conviction among many Kuwaitis that the
biggest part of the outstanding Souq al Manakh debt lies in a small number
of rich and influential hands and that any interest-free rescheduling would
let such debtors off.
With the government intent on courting favour before the October elections,
it is likely to approve, despite the bankers, a plan which would expect
interest payments from the biggest debtors.
In the end, however, any plan may make little actual difference to the
amount of money retrieved. Debtors under the old debt settlement scheme had
little difficulty in creatively accounting their way out of paying interest
on their debts. Moreover, debtors who slithered clear of the old scheme
apparently fear little from the new one. 'The general feeling in the market
is that they won't have to pay anything anyway at the end of the day,' says
one leading Kuwait accountant.
In the end, the scale of debt recovery will be the worry of the government,
the new creditor under the scheme, rather than the banks. But the debt plan
will have further knock-on effects on their ability to resume business as
usual. For one thing, banks will find it difficult to assess the
creditworthiness of any of their clients who are also engaged in the
separate process of having their old debts assessed under the rescheduling
scheme.
Since the rescheduling scheme theoretically has priority on any debtor's
assets, banks will not be able to judge their ability to repay fresh loans
until a scheme for repayment of their old ones is assessed and under way.
Since the rescheduling scheme embraces more than 6,000 debtors, this means
many of the banks' best clients are likely to be included.
'For 1992, most banks are not going to be able to lend much, if anything, to
the private sector,' concludes one bank analyst.
The effect on most banks' return on equity is therefore likely to be sharp
and depressing. Not only will fresh lending be constrained, but the loans
which are to be replaced by government bonds also represent in most cases
40-50 per cent of banks' assets. These will, after the buy-out, give a
return only of the banks' average cost of funds.
But if this will have the effect of crimping banks' earnings, so too, in the
view of most bankers, will the likely economic prospects in Kuwait itself.
Two aspects of post-war Kuwait are particular concerns: the diminution of
Kuwait's population, and its demographic mix.
Bankers point out that the exodus of 400,000 Palestinians essentially
represents the loss of upwards of 100,000 families who kept and maintained
homes in Kuwait.
Although a smaller number of Egyptians and other expatriates have entered
Kuwait since liberation to fill some of the gaps left by this exodus, for
the most part these are bachelors with much more modest spending patterns
and a greater propensity to remit earnings out of the country. Bankers in
Kuwait readily admit that even with a population of 2.2m people before the
Iraqi invasion, the emirate was overbanked. But with as many as 1m fewer
people and much tighter competition for what good business exists, the
banking sector is certain to contract.
Indeed, Kuwait's banks have already slimmed considerably since the war. Most
have opened only half their branches and are operating with about 40 per
cent of their pre-invasion staff level. Few analysts expect banks to expand
much, if at all, beyond these levels for the next year at least. 'Cost
cutting is the Holy Grail just now,' says one Gulf bank official.
The next, and some argue inevitable step, is for there to be fewer banks.
This is the professed ambition of the central bank, which has repeatedly
insisted since liberation that the banks should consider mergers. But talk
of bank mergers predates even bankers' moans about bad Souq al Manakh debts
and so far such talk is little more than speculative gossip.
In the view of most analysts, the issue can be sensibly broached only once
the banks are able to publish balance sheets. No bank has done this since
1989 and none can until implementation of the debt settlement programme.
'There's not a hell of a lot anyone can say about Kuwait's banks until we
have some books to look at,' says one analyst of the Kuwait market.
For now, groups such as Capital Intelligence, the leading Gulf credit rating
agency, are recommending that all Kuwait banks be treated more or less as
sovereign risk until figures are revealed. They are also cautioning foreign
banks seeking to establish relationships with Kuwaiti banks to hold off
until the picture becomes clearer.
Until then, Kuwait's bankers remain condemned to living in the short-term
world they have occupied since they opened their first branches immediately
after liberation: servicing depositors, lending limited and short-term funds
to selected traders, dabbling in foreign exchange markets, processing
letters of credit and, above all, drumming their fingers on the desk waiting
impatiently for what is billed as final approval of the final plan to clear
their bad debts.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (3): Hive of electioneering - Mark
Nicholson examines politics in the emirate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTIONS for a new Kuwaiti National Assembly do not take place for another
eight months, but you would scarcely know it. The emirate is already a hive
of electioneering.
Opposition groups, seeking to revive the momentum they enjoyed immediately
after Kuwait's liberation, hold regular combined meetings attracting more
than 1,000 people.
More than 40 members of the National Council, the interim consultative
assembly reconvened by the Emir last year, have declared their candidature
and some have already enjoyed lusty public exchanges with opposition
figures.
Diwaniyas, Kuwait's unique home-based discussion groups, are more numerous
and politicised than ever. And the government scarcely appears to twitch
without thinking first of the electoral consequences.
In part, the buzz surrounding October's poll manifests political ambitions
pent up since the Emir dissolved the last full National Assembly in 1986 -
and with it selected paragraphs of the country's 1961 constitution - citing
security reasons for suspending a forum which was offering increasingly
bitter and troublesome opposition to the government's policies and some of
its ministers - none of whom the Assembly had powers to appoint.
The excitement also reflects a broad will, most vocally put by opposition
groups, to get to grips with the governance of the new post-war Kuwait. But
as to whether, finally, the war has substantially altered the real issues of
Kuwaiti politics, or the political alignment of its limited electorate,
opinions are mixed, and firm judgments are probably premature.
One certain change since Kuwait's last poll will be the size of the
electorate, which is limited to Kuwaiti males over 21 who can trace family
lineage back to Kuwait City in the 1920s. Due largely to the youthful
profile of Kuwait's population, by October more than 90,000 Kuwaitis will be
on the electoral roll.
This is a rise of 30,000 on the number eligible to vote in the June 1990
election for the interim, and purely consultative, National Council - of
which half of its 75 members were government appointees.
Women and 'second degree Kuwaitis' - Kuwaiti citizens not so tightly defined
by reference to their 1920s forbears - will not vote in the 1992 poll,
although Sheikh Jaber al Sabah, the Emir, has promised to 'study' their
eventual enfranchisement and the next assembly is sure to have this issue
near the top of its agenda.
Campaigning proper cannot start formally until three weeks before the
election date, which remains to be set. From that time, candidates will be
allowed to raise tents outside their homes to entertain election gatherings
 -not the least attractive feature of which are some candidates' efforts to
compete in providing the most lavish cuisine.
The social onus laid on Kuwaiti election meetings is characteristic of the
emirate's brand of 'democracy' which traditionally places heavy stress on
the achievement of consensus - very often through the institution of the
Diwaniya, itself a fundamentally social gathering. Diwaniyas, hosted by and
open to members of the ruling family and ordinary Kuwaitis alike, are a
highly efficient grapevine in what is essentially a cosy, if clannish, city
state.
'We grind and grind, and eventually reach consensus,' says Mr Jasem
Qabazard, a member of the National Council, both of its own decision-making
process and that of Kuwait overall.
Mr Qabazard and other members of the National Council, which is condemned by
the main opposition groups as being unconstitutional, claim this consensual
system is the defining point of Kuwaiti politics - of which the written
constitution is merely a reflection. 'There is an unwritten constitution
that balance should always be maintained among the main families here,' says
Mr Ibrahim Shehabi, another National Council member.
The opposition, particularly the Democratic Forum, a grouping of largely
western-educated leftists and liberals, disputes this strongly, claiming
Kuwait's political structure should flow from the constitution, and that any
political decision made since parts of it were suspended in 1986 is
illegitimate. 'Any government without constitutional control risks becoming
a corrupt government,' says Mr Mohammed al Ghadiri, a Democratic Forum
spokesman.
For the opposition, both secular and Islamic, the National Assembly is the
means by which Kuwaitis can keep the rule of the al-Sabah family
accountable. Although the 50 elected members of the assembly cannot pick
government ministers, 16 of whom also sit on the assembly, it can
constitutionally demand their appearance to justify policies and it has a
limited veto on government legislation.
The strength of the opposition's challenge in the October elections is
difficult to assess - although it is already clear that it will fight
energetically for seats. The Democratic Forum, which declared itself a
political party late last year in defiance of an unwritten prohibition on
such, says it will field 10-15 candidates and expects to win at least five
or more seats.
Of the various Islamic groups, the Sunni fundamentalist Islamic
Constitutional Movement, which wants to see Sharia law enacted in Kuwait,
says it will field 15, while the Islamic Alliance, another Sunni group, will
field a further 10. The main Shia group, the National Islamic Coalition,
says only that it will field 'many' candidates. Shia Moslems comprise some
fifth of Kuwait's population.
The opposition groups will command considerable domestic news coverage, not
least now that the government has formally lifted censorship in local
papers, and there will be much western interest during the campaign. But
many observers suggest that voters will return essentially the same interest
groups which have dominated Kuwait's representative assemblies in the past -
a mix of merchants, Islamic groups, leftists, bedouin and western-style
liberals - and that the conservatism of Kuwait's voters should not be
underestimated. 'In practice,' says one diplomat, 'it will be the same
parish pump politics it has been since the first national assembly in the
1960s.'
Moreover, despite the prominence of opposition spokesmen immediately after
liberation, many observers suggest that the government has gone a long way
towards quieting the vehemence of post-liberation demands for democracy by
realising its promise of holding elections, by not tampering with
constituency boundaries - a trick opposition groups had feared - and,
perhaps most important, by offering most Kuwaitis a good deal of
pre-election largesse.
The government has not only raised the salaries of civil servants - up to 90
per cent of whom are Kuwaitis - by 25 per cent, but it has also written off
all Kuwaitis' pre-war housing and consumer loan debts.
Moreover, some suggest that the preoccupation with achieving consensus in
Kuwait offers the country a political self-righting quality. 'There are
people rocking the boat,' says a western diplomat. 'But when the deck gets
too near the water, people tend to rush over to the other side to balance
it.'
However, the real test of this self-righting will come immediately before
the elections. If opposition groups find themselves able to command large
and raucus gatherings at their campaign tents, some diplomats fear the
government could lose its nerve and call in the security forces - much as it
did during pro-democracy demonstrations in Spring 1990, the last time
Kuwait's political season was in full swing.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (2): Shopping spree curtailed - Trade and
Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRIP a country of its valuables and the chances are it will go on a
shopping spree at the earliest opportunity to restock.
This is what has happened in Kuwait, but the spree has been less than
frenetic. Several factors have prevented the spending boom that western
exporters had hoped for and the government's policy of trying to make Kuwait
truly Kuwaiti, as it sees it, has reduced the population.
About 400,000 Palestinians, many of whom earned relatively high wages in
professional and technical positions, are no longer there. Kuwait's overall
market is barely two-thirds of its pre-war size.
The Kuwaitis and expatriates who have returned since the war have been less
inclined, and less able, to spend than before, mainly because of their
reduced means and reduced creditworthiness.
Individual country's exports to Kuwait are either little changed from
pre-war levels or they are dramatically lower.
US companies have maintained or increased their sales to Kuwait by taking a
bigger slice of a smaller cake. They have lifted sales largely at the
expense of Japanese exporters and, to a lesser extent, the Germans. US sales
have been helped by the Kuwaiti 'thank you' factor since the war. The
government has favoured goods from those countries that took part in the
allied war effort against Iraq, in particular the US.
Certain items have enjoyed a one-off replacement surge, but the rest of the
market is flat. Where sales have boomed, the boom has been shorter and less
intense than exporters had hoped. An immediate post-war jump in sales of
cars, electrical goods and food is levelling off.
Aside from spending still to come on reconstruction, the boom, such as it
was, is petering out.
Restocking in the cars sector was underway within weeks of the Iraqi
departure last February. More than half the country's 560,000 cars, trucks
and buses were stolen or destroyed. Government ministries, shops and offices
were virtually stripped. The Iraqis left with cars, computers, industrial
machinery, food and an array of spare parts.
American exports, dominated by car and truck sales, stood at Dollars 748m up
to September last year and could be close to Dollars 1bn for the whole year,
according to US officials in Kuwait. This compares with sales of about
Dollars 800m in 1989.
By contrast, Japanese exports to Kuwait, mainly cars and electrical goods,
were only a fraction of 1989 sales, at Dollars 180m by October last year.
Sales in 1989 were around Dollars 670m. Japan, whose important trading
partners in the Gulf are Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, has
taken a much lower profile since the war.
German sales, consisting mainly of cars, machinery and electrical goods,
were just over Dollars 93m up to October compared with about Dollars 400m in
1989.
British sales to Kuwait, dominated by machinery and food, were Dollars 180m
for the whole of last year, about 80 per cent of 1989 exports. The main
exporting countries have arranged with export credit guarantee packages,
including Dollars 2bn by the US Ex-im bank (confined to public sector
projects), Dollars 700m by the UK authorities, Dollars 1bn by the Japanese
and Dollars 550m by France.
Kuwait's roads, which were mercifully quiet for a brief period after the
war, are again crammed with foreign cars.
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler of the US are, predictably, selling more
strongly than the big Japanese operators, Nissan and Toyota. US officials
say this is also because American companies were quicker to get started on
spare parts and financing than their rivals.
In addition to US and Japanese models that still dominate the roads, Land
Rovers now occupy a tiny niche - the British manufacturer has sold about 550
since the war ended.
The Al Mulla group, one of Kuwait's big family trading companies, imports a
vast range of goods, including vehicles from Chrysler, Mitsubishi and John
Deere and computers, office equipment, and white goods from IBM, Zenith,
Zanussi, General Electric, Minolta, Groupe Bull and Sharpe.
The group's office equipment section says it has been selling between 40 and
60 machines a month over the past year; sales worth about Dollars 4m. But
demand is slowing across the board. 'Sales peaked by about November, says Mr
Aranasalam Narenthiran, Al Mulla's deputy managing director. 'The market has
not exactly dried up but it is levelling off.'
Showrooms and warehouses are bulging. Agents and their supply companies
abroad had banked on a longer boom and many traders have overstocked as a
result.
'There's nothing we can do except monitor our stocks very carefully to try
to make sure we aren't left with big stocks on our hands and a dead market,'
says the sales manager of one Kuwaiti trading company.
Al-Sayer, Toyota's agent in Kuwait, lost 1,500 new cars and 850 used cars
during the occupation. It was five months before Toyota was shipping enough
cars to meet demand immediately after the war.
Since then, Toyota has shipped in 9,145 cars, but sales have tailed off and
it has sold only 5,800. Annual sales before the war were around 12,000.
Toyota says it is now looking to consolidate sales at between 9,000 and
10,000 a year.
While the big family traders have been able to gain credit, restock and
sell, conditions for the country's thousands of small and medium-sized
businesses, most of them already in debt, have been extremely difficult.
Without the backing of big exporting companies, many have been unable to get
started again and face collapse in the months ahead.
'The difficulty for smaller traders is that they can't get credit from the
banks whereas the larger businesses can,' says Mr Hilal Al Mutairi,
director-general of the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
representing the country's 18,000 businesses. 'We are hoping the government
goes ahead with a proposed programme to buy up all the debts,' says Mr Al
Mutairi. The debts would then be rescheduled over 20 years at low or zero
interest rates. This would enable businesses to negotiate fresh credit with
the banks and restart.
The government is itself burdened with the costs of war and reconstruction
although it may have to come up with some sort of commercial write-off. Any
such package may come too late for the hundreds of businesses that have
missed the shopping spree and are still struggling to reopen.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (1): Foundations of the future - On the
anniversary of Kuwait's liberation, 'Kuwait for the Kuwaitis' sums up what
many Kuwaitis hope will be the most apparent change in the emirate's
post-war character. But a number of Kuwaitis are less sure of the benefits
of removing at a stroke a core component of the country's educated Arab
middle class

A PAIR of bumper stickers on a brand new Chevrolet Caprice outside a Kuwait
hotel sums up much of the sentiment in the emirate a year after liberation.
One reads: 'Kuwait is Free, thank you America]' The other, beneath it,
proclaims: 'Kuwait for the Kuwaitis'.
Not only do the slogans illuminate Kuwait's determination to present a
spirit of post-war assurance; the medium itself says much about how Kuwaitis
have striven to package and contain the memories of their ordeal.
With Kuwait City now spruced up and tidied, the skies cleared of depressing
clouds from the oil fires and the rusting detritus of war visible only on
excursions out of the city, Kuwait has sought to render memories of the war
in uniting, patriotic colours.
Bright, triumphalist murals adorn city walls and a new memorial of a
shattered Iraqi tank, surrounded by the flags of members of the coalition of
couyntries which evicted the Iraqis, sits beside the Information Ministry.
Early tensions between those 200,000 Kuwaitis who endured occupation and the
400,000 who fled have been dissolved in part by a campaign to unite all
Kuwaitis around the yellow flags, fluttering across the city, reminding them
of the 1,053 Kuwaitis who have yet to return from Iraq.
While the past is being taken care of, the foundations of Kuwait's post-war
future are also becoming increasingly clear. The slogan 'Kuwait for the
Kuwaitis' serves as well as any to sum up what the government, and the
greater part of Kuwaitis themselves, hope will be the most apparent change
in the emirate's post-war character.
From the moment of Kuwait's liberation, the government declared its
intention that Kuwaitis, previously a 38 per cent minority in the emirate's
pre-war population of 2.2m, should enjoy a majority in their own country.
Today, thanks essentially to the banishment of up to 400,000 Palestinians
and Jordanians - 'non-preferred nationalities' is the bureaucratic euphemism
 -and a determined policy of having no non-Kuwaiti nationality comprise more
than 10 per cent of the total population, this intention looks likely to
stick.
The policy is not without its costs or its critics. Not only has it shorn
Kuwait of the best of its technical and managerial expatriate workers, it
has also deprived the emirate of nearly 100,000 families who made their home
in Kuwait, and in turn made a living for a large body of Kuwaiti merchants.
But many Kuwaitis, who have always been suspicious of the Palestinians'
political ambitions in the emirate, seem content to pay this price.
'I don't see it as a social cost - more a security gain,' says the Kuwaiti
manager of an engineering company who has lost all but a handful of his best
trained staff.
But a number of Kuwaitis are less sure of the benefits of removing, at a
stroke, a core component of the emirate's educated, Arab middle class and
replacing it largely with bachelor workers. 'The place of expatriates in
this country should be more than just working and sleeping,' says a Kuwaiti
banker.
Moreover, the resulting shortage of middle-management skills in the emirate
implies the need for Kuwaitis to fill jobs they have historically shunned
and, for all the jolt caused by the war, show no signs yet of embracing.
Nevertheless, Kuwait's ambition to curb its population is one of several the
government struggled to achieve before the Iraqi invasion, but which the war
suddenly put within reach. Another is the job of clearing the country's
banks of the billions of dinars of bad debt which has shackled them since
the collapse in 1982 of the rashly speculative Souq al Manakh kerb stock
market.
In the post-war economic hiatus, the government has seized the chance to
propose a massive buy-out of the debt in return for government bonds.
The government also looks set to wash its hands of pre-war subsidies for
non-oil manufacturing industries in the emirate - a trendy and expensive
enterprise undertaken by all Gulf states throughout the 1980s in the name of
economic diversification, but one which in Kuwait was sponsored with mixed
government feeling and met with indifferent success.
As a mark of the post-war shift, the Industrial Bank of Kuwait has stopped
granting concessionary lending - the very reason it was established.
Manufacturing in Kuwait has lain moribund since liberation and appears about
to die.
Kuwait's economy will therefore - at least for the next few years - shrink
with its population and rely more obviously on its oil revenues alone.
These, the oil fires having been quenched with a speed matched by the
industry's recovery in output, should be near pre-war levels by the end of
1992.
'In the final analysis,' says a senior official with National Bank of Kuwait
by way of an economic precis, 'this is a country which can pump 2m barrels
of oil a day. We can rebuild our oil facilities and we know how much that
will cost.'
However, the loss of much of Kuwait's pre-war investment income, with as
much as Dollars 30bn of its 1990 portfolio of about Dollars 65bn in overseas
holdings having been liquidated to pay off war-related costs, means the
emirate will have to watch its domestic expenditure and perhaps borrow more
than the Dollars 5.5bn syndicated international loan signed late last year.
The spectre of rising costs and falling revenues alarms some economists.
'The most important thing now is to stop driving the country towards a
permanent deficit, both internal and external,' warns Mr Jassem al-Saddoun,
a prominent Kuwaiti economist who declares pessimism over the government's
attempts to take full control of the economy.
But the government hopes that fewer expatriates will mean less spending on
public services. Also, the total reconstruction bill, which optimistic
foreign contractors put at Dollars 100bn as the war ended, looks certain to
settle at a far more modest Dollars 20bn. About half of this will be spent
on repairing the oil industry and the greatest part of the remainder will go
towards putting Kuwait's armed forces back on their feet.
Rebuilding apart, the government's economic priorities will otherwise
revolve around spreading what it can afford of Kuwait's oil income as widely
and judiciously as possible - a particular priority in this election year,
but always at the root of most government thinking in the emirate.
'Economic policy here is not so much about creating the right circumstances
for production, more getting the distribution right,' remarks a local
economist.
Dividing up the pie has always been the central feature of Kuwaiti politics
and the war has not changed this. In accomplishing this task, the government
has been careful recently to consult closely with the National Council, the
interim assembly reconvened after liberation by Sheik Jaber al Sabah, the
Emir, as a stop-gap consultative body to tide the country over until the
October's elections to the full National Assembly.
The Emir suspended the National Assembly in 1986 in the face of its strident
opposition to some of his appointed ministers. He created the Council early
in 1990 to head off opposition calls for the Assembly's restitution.
The Council, decried by opposition groups as unconstitutional in the absence
of the full Assembly, is widely seen, not least by some of its own members,
as the government's training school for loyalist candidates in the next
election.
Its 75 members, half of whom are government appointees, will certainly claim
credit for prodding the government into the popular decision to raise
salaries in the civil service, which employs the vast majority of Kuwaitis,
by 25 per cent. Some 42 National Councillors said this month that they would
contest the October poll.
At least as many opposition candidates will stand, representing the familiar
and divergent strands of leftist, liberal and Islamic thinking in Kuwait,
united at least in demanding that the new parliament should exercise a limit
on the exercise of the al-Sabah family's ruling power - a familiar rallying
point which long predates the war.
It is too soon properly to assess the likely strength of this opposition
challenge at elections in eight months' time, for while stern criticism of
the government's indecision and lack of managerial talent is widespread
among Kuwaitis, so, too, is the popularity of much of what the government
has been seen to achieve.
By signing military co-operation pacts with the US and UK, the government
has made Kuwaitis feel more secure than they have done for years. Oil
revenues are reviving apace and the government has wasted no time in putting
a little of this money into most pockets, both through pay rises and by
writing off outstanding consumer loans.
The post-war arrival of 100,000 new cars in the emirate and countless
thousands of brown and white goods testifies to how much Kuwaitis have
enjoyed their re-stocking.
Indeed, the overriding Kuwaiti concern these days appears to be restoring
private and family life. 'Everyone is only concerned with themselves,' says
Mr Jasem Qabazard, a National Council member.' Everyone is preoccupied.'
If the result is to create a strong and pervasive feeling of introspection
and insularity in Kuwait, few Kuwaitis seem worried by that. 'The feeling
is, Allah gave us oil and we will enjoy that in peace,' says one western
diplomat. 'It is a dream of being outside the world.'

FT  26 FEB 92 / Record UK loan losses shrink NatWest results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RECORD losses on UK loans in 1991 led to a collapse in the profits of
National Westminster, the UK clearing bank, to their lowest level since
1975.
As a result, the bank plans to cut staff numbers by at least 4,000 this
year, having shed 6,400 jobs last year.
NatWest's pre-tax profits last year dropped 78 per cent to Pounds 110m
(Dollars 192m) due to a bad debt charge of Pounds 1.99bn, which included
losses on UK lending of Pounds 1.45bn, the biggest ever incurred by a UK
bank.
The poor results - which meant that NatWest had to withdraw Pounds 220m from
reserves to pay a maintained dividend of 17.5p a share - represent a sharp
reversal in its fortunes. Only three years ago it made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1.41bn, more than any other UK bank before or since.
None the less its trading surplus in 1991 rose 20 per cent to a record
Pounds 2.03bn, largely due to a sharp rise in commissions.
NatWest's bad debt charge meant that its UK financial services division  -
the heart of its business and including its 2,816 branches - made a loss, of
Pounds 5m, for the first time.
Lord Alexander, chairman, said that there had been 'some departures from the
principles of sound lending'.
Mr Tom Frost, who has been group chief executive since 1987 and retires next
year, said it was bad banking practice to sack staff for making bad loans.
Bankers 'would not lend any money at all', if they feared their jobs were on
the line for lending mistakes.
NatWest's losses to the Maxwell empire were lower than expected, at Pounds
50m, according to analysts.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Kurds seek long-term UK aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdish Democratic party, arrived in
London yesterday saying he would ask Mr John Major, Britain's prime
minister, to provide long-term development aid to enable Iraqi Kurds to
become self-sufficient.
He said he would also ask Britain to make a commitment to help protect the
Kurds against further Iraqi aggression and to provide observers for
elections to be held in northern Iraq in April.
Mr Barzani, who is to hold talks with Mr Major this afternoon, said the
combined effects of the United Nations embargo against Iraq and Baghdad's
internal blockade of the Kurds threatened to cause a 'social explosion' in
Iraqi Kurdistan. Although he said fighting in northern Iraq had calmed
considerably in recent weeks, Mr Barzani said the embargoes had caused
severe food and fuel shortages.
The Kurdish leader is also hoping Britain, France and the US will extend its
commitment to keep protective forces in Turkey, at present comprising 48
fighter aircraft based at Incirlik airbase, beyond the present mandate which
runs until June. 'As long as there is no political settlement on the ground,
it is vital that there are forces there to give long-term protection to the
Kurds,' he said.
Mr Barzani said Kurdish groups were still seeking a negotiated agreement
with Baghdad over Kurdish autonomy, although talks between Kurdish leaders
and the regime of Mr Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi president, have been frozen
for some months.

<TEXT>
An Opec official questioned the phenomenon of global warming yesterday and
said a proposed EC carbon tax to combat it was a ploy to control world
energy markets, Reuter reports from Cairo. 'We do not know whether global
warming is a certainty or not,' Mr Mohammed al-Sahlawi, head of OPEC's news
agency, told a symposium of economists. 'Is there really a man-made problem,
or is it part of a natural cycle?'
Brussels plans to introduce a tax of Dollars 1 per barrel of oil in 1993 to
fight global warming and curb demand for oil. The tax would rise to Dollars
10 a barrel by the year 2000.

FT  26 FEB 92 / Brussels aid inquiry over Dutch Volvo deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is today expected to launch a state aid
investigation into what it believes are unduly generous terms on which the
Dutch government admitted Mitsubishi of Japan as a shareholder into Volvo of
the Netherlands, write David Buchan in Brussels and Ronald van de Krol in
Amsterdam.
In December, the Dutch government reduced its 70 per cent stake in the local
Volvo car-making operation by selling 33 per cent to Mitsubishi and 3 per
cent to Volvo of Sweden which previously held 30 per cent, putting all three
partners on a par. The government has committed itself to pulling out
altogether by 1998 by selling its one-third stake (at 1991 prices) equally
to the two car-makers.
The government is also understood to be giving soft loans to the two
car-makers' joint venture to replace the '400' series of Volvo with a new
model. Brussels believes the prospects for the venture are too good to
justify any subsidy. Failure of a government to behave like a rational
investor has become a key test Brussels applies to judge whether state 'aid'
is involved.

FT  25 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures lead new advance by shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STOCK market now virt-ually becalmed ahead of the UK Budget on March 10,
and the general election widely expected to follow within a month, was led
higher by the futures market yesterday. Trading volume in shares was modest
and the gain of 17.4 in the FT-SE Index was largely achieved in early deals
when the March contract on the Footsie opened very strongly.
Underlying optimism was sustained by expectations that a further  1/2 point
cut in UK base rates will either precede or swiftly follow Budget day. The
latest UK opinion polls favoured Mr Major's Conservative government, and
there were new hints from political sources that April 9 has been chosen as
election day.
However, the first day of the new equity trading account made an unexciting
start, with traders disinclined to adopt new strategies in a market which
this week faces a heavy list of corporate trading statements, notably from
the banking sector.
Share prices opened lower behind unimpressive performances from equities in
New York and Tokyo, and were also restrained by downward adjustments in a
number of leading stocks to take account of dividend payments.
The trend in equities was abruptly reversed when the stock index futures
opened and the March contract on the Footsie showed a premium of around 38
points over the underlying cash market. The stock market moved ahead and,
although there was little genuine investment activity, the Footsie broke
through the 2,550 mark to gain 20.7 at 2,563.0.
This level proved to be the best of the day, and the stock market merely
trod water for the rest of the trading session. A somewhat uneven opening to
the new session on Wall Street, which was 7.8 up on the Dow Industrial
Average when London closed, gave little incentive to traders in the UK.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,559.7 for an advance on the day
of 17.4 points. Seaq volume slipped lower, recording 440.5m shares traded
compared with 569.5m on Friday.
Traders, however, pointed out that the daily Seaq figures have proved a poor
guide recently to underlying retail, or customer, business in equities.
Friday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.3bn, the highest total for the
month and comfortably inside the margin of profitability for the
London-based securities firms.
The banking and financial stocks, which are prominent in this week's list of
corporate news, closed firmly. Sterling's continued improvement against the
D-Mark buttressed confidence in prospects for reductions in UK base rates.
Retail and consumer stocks, the immediate beneficiaries from lower interest
rates, found buyers.
There was some nervousness, however, ahead of the UK trade figures for
January, which are due on Thursday. Analysts fear that the trade figures
will be disappointing, Kleinwort Benson Securities suggesting an increase in
the monthly current account deficit to around Pounds 450m.
Nomura Research Institute warned that the trade figures, together with the
unemployment data for last month, will draw attention to long term trends
which may eventually undermine the sustainability of sterling's current rate
within the European exchange rate mechanism.

<TEXT>
A LARGE buying order trig-gered a squeeze of stock index futures, leading to
a sharp advance in the March contract on the FT-SE Index, writes Joel
Kibazo.
March opened firmly at 2,550, with traders moving quickly to cover short
overnight positions. An order for 800 contracts, combined with earlier
demand, led to a squeeze by late morning, sending the contract sharply
forward to touch the day's high of 2,587, and pulling the underlying cash
market higher.
Light midsession profit-taking saw the contract drift off, and a further
decline occurred following an easier opening on Wall Street.
March closed at 2,579, up 24 on the previous session and around 13 points
above the estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Turnover was a
healthy 9,040 contracts.
The traded options market remained dull with turnover reaching only 22,419
lots. The FT-SE 100 index option was busy, trading 9,031 contracts.
British Airways was the busiest stock option on 1,318 contracts dealt, with
April 260 calls particularly active. Thames Water had 1,296 contracts
traded, while British Aerospace recorded a total of 1,239 lots transacted.

FT  25 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Investors show caution as Dow
edges to new high
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
ALTHOUGH US stock markets lacked a firm direction yesterday in the absence
of fresh economic news, the Dow blue chip indicator edged ahead to an
all-time high, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.23 at 3,282.42, just
eclipsing last Thursday's record of 3,280.64. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
finished 0.81 firmer at 412.27, but the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter
stocks, still under pressure from profit-taking, slipped 4.82 to 624.93.
Turnover on the New York SE was light at 181m shares.
Although the Dow has reached new highs in recent days, the energy behind the
market's rally from mid-December to mid-January appears to have dissipated.
Investors are now picking their stocks more carefully, sector rotation
remains a dominant theme, and analysts predict that the market will probably
not make further strides until it has evidence of an improvement in
corporate earnings.
Among individual stocks, General Motors dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 37
3/4 after reporting a Dollars 4.5bn loss in the full year of 1991. Although
the losses and the plant closures had been expected, they underlined how
hard the recession has hit the US manufacturing base. Ford and Chrysler
eased in sympathy, by Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 36 7/8 and Dollars  1/8 to
Dollars 16 7/8 respectively.
RJR Nabisco rose early on but ended unchanged at Dollars 10 1/8 in active
trading after the company announced that it had bought back Dollars 1bn of
high-cost debt in a private transaction. This will result in a first-quarter
after-tax charge of about Dollars 160m.
Bank of Boston fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 18 1/4 as investors reacted to
last Friday's news that the banking group had filed to offer 8m common
shares.
Eljer Industries weakened Dollars 1 to Dollars 9 1/8 after the company said
that it would take special reserves, write-offs and adjustments totalling
Dollars 30m in the fourth quarter of the 1991 year.
Texas Instruments eased Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 38 5/8 on news that the
computer chip manufacturer is in talks to buy the rights of Chips &amp;
Technologies' integrated circuits that imitate Intel's 386 microprocessor.
Intel, quoted on Nasdaq, dropped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 65 3/8 .
Elsewhere on the Nasdaq market, Zenith Laboratories jumped Dollars 3 5/8 to
Dollars 23 3/4 on reports that a US district court had ruled that Zenith's
Cefadroxil drug does not infringe a Bristol-Myers Squibb patent.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed a narrowly traded day on an uptick, ending a string of
nine straight sessions of losses. Today's Federal Budget kept traders
cautious, although most said they were expecting no major changes.
The composite index was finally 6.6 firmer at 3,543.2, while advances edged
ahead of declines by 297 to 290 after a volume of 26.7m shares valued at
CDollars 237m.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Rates little changed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK RATES ended the day 'if anything slightly firmer', as one dealer put it,
as the market came to terms with the realisation that there was unlikely to
be a base rate cut before the Budget on March 10.
'I think a lot of people came in this morning with lingering hopes of a
cut,' said the dealer, 'but realised that wasn't likely.'
The key three months interbank rate, which closely shadows base rates, ended
the day unchanged at 10 5/16 -10 1/4 per cent.
Short sterling futures opened two basis points higher at 89.82, but ended at
89.80, unchanged from Friday. This indicates that, although the market may
not be expecting an immediate base rate reduction, one is still anticipated
before the contract falls due on March 18.
The overnight rate swung throughout the day, opening at 10 3/4 -10 5/8 per
cent but falling as low as 9 1/2 per cent by early afternoon. It then firmed
all the way back up to 10 1/2 per cent at the close as several big banks
found themselves short.
The forecast shortfall was originally put at around Pounds 1.4bn, much
higher than expected. The Bank of England acted early to take out most of
the shortage, buying Pounds 750m of Band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent
outright, and Pounds 450m of paper for resale to the market on March 12 and
13 at 10 7/16 per cent.
The shortfall was later revised upwards to Pounds 1.5bn, and the Bank bought
another Pounds 250m of Band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
In spite of the publication of economic data showing that French GDP was
flat in the fourth quarter, the Bank of France left its intervention rate
unchanged at 9.60 per cent at a securities repurchase tender to allocate
funds for injection into the money market today. It accepted bids for
FFr41.8bn in new liquidity, FFr3.1bn less than the FFr44.9bn that will leave
the market today.
German call money rates were unchanged at 9.45/55 per cent as dealers waited
for this week's repurchase transaction.
In the US, the Federal Reserve refrained from open market operations, in
spite of analysts' expectations that it would add reserves to the banking
system.
Federal funds were trading at 4 per cent, up from Friday's 3.90 per cent
average. Traders are awaiting testimony today by Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed
chairman, before the senate banking committee.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar retraces early gains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR retraced early gains yesterday, after touching important
technical barriers against the yen and D-Mark.
The US currency reached a high of DM 1.6647 early in the day, up from a
London opening of DM 1.6610. But it failed to breach the DM 1.6650 barrier,
and fell back to close in London at DM 1.6510. In New York it edged up to
end at DM 1.6525.
Against the yen, the dollar pushed upwards through the important Y 129 level
in Asian trading. The final impetus came from a Dollars 2bn purchase by a
big Japanese player deliberately aimed at breaching the Y 129 level, market
sources said.
The US unit had ended in New York on Friday at Y 128.95. By the London
opening it had reached Y 129.45, but had dropped back to Y 129.15 by the
close. In New York it finished still at Y 129.15.
One influence was a comment to Reuters by a Bank of Japan official that the
dollar might face strong market resistance at around Y 130. Coming after
last week's intervention by Japan, this was seen as a heavy hint of official
opposition to a Y 130 rate. In spite of such comments, the dollar's
weakening was 'largely a technical correction', argued Michael Feeny of
Sumitomo Bank, 'not a panic caused by fears of central bank intervention'.
Market participants had been reminiscing during the day about the last
large-scale concerted intervention a year ago, he said. On that occasion,
central banks failed to hold down the dollar for more than a week or so.
Such recollections now, he added, were 'perhaps a sign that the market is
turning still more bullish'.
Sterling was caught in the dollar backwash, trading at Dollars 1.7350 in the
morning (compared with Friday's Dollars 1.7460) but closing at Dollars
1.7485. Against the D-Mark, the pound rose from Friday's DM 2.8822 and an
opening rate of DM 2.8847 to touch DM 2.8852 before closing at DM 2.8835.
Sterling tracked its floor against the peseta for much of the day, rarely
rising enough above it to encourage hopes of a green light for an easing in
UK interest rates. The market noted weekend comments by Mr Carlos Solchaga,
Spain's economy minister, which pointed out that the room for manoeuvre on
peseta interest rates was limited by the actions of other EMS countries.
Mr Solchaga said: 'It might be possible, if wages are fixed in accord with
inflation goals, to lower rates a little and therefore not have the peseta
near its upper limits, although I fear the currency markets will not easily
let us do it.' He added that if the UK cut interest rates in view of the
coming elections, the effect on Spanish rates might depend on the size of
the British cut. 'If it is a small drop, perhaps we would not need to change
ours.'
Interpretations of these comments varied: London dealers were reading it as
an indication that Spain would be unlikely to cut rates before the UK did.
But share prices in Madrid moved higher in anticipation of an interest rate
cut.

York listing
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community is likely to enter into direct negotiations with the
Securities &amp; Exchange Commission - the US securities regulator - over
removing obstacles to the listing of German and other European companies'
shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
The development follows unsuccessful attempts last year by a number of large
German companies to persuade the SEC to moderate its requirement that all
foreign companies wanting to list their shares in the US should comply with
full listing requirements.
Not a single German company has a listing in the US, chiefly because of an
extreme reluctance to publish figures in line with US Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles as required by the SEC. US accounting rules require
far greater disclosure than the German equivalent and have a tendency to
make reported profits look more generous than in Germany.
German companies, including Daimler-Benz, the big chemicals companies and
some big banks, are believed to have argued with the SEC last year that
their shares ought to be accepted for a listing on a reciprocal basis -
namely that if they have met listing requirements in Germany they ought to
be accepted in the US too.

become chief executive
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Daniel Tully moved a step nearer to taking over the helm at the biggest
securities house in the US yesterday when Merrill Lynch announced he will
take over the additional post of chief executive in May.
The announcement did not surprise Wall Street as in recent years Mr Tully,
currently president and chief operating officer, has played an increasingly
important role in the running of Merrill.
The post of chief executive is filled now by Mr William Schreyer, Merrill
chairman, who has held the post since 1985 but who plans to retire in June
1993. Although Merrill will not confirm it officially, yesterday's decision
makes it almost certain that Mr Tully will succeed Mr Schreyer as chairman.
The two have effectively run Merrill for the past 10 years, and have earned
equal amounts of criticism (for letting costs run wild and profitability
deteriorate during the 1980s) and praise (for cutting costs and improving
profitability in the past three years) during their stint at the top.
Both Mr Schreyer, 64, and Mr Tully, 60, joined Merrill in the early part of
their careers. Mr Tully has been credited with helping the firm build up its
asset management business to such an extent that it now manages Dollars
435bn of client assets.

European market

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN markets continued to wait nervously yesterday on the US government
bond market - and the US dollar - to set a new direction for bond prices. In
the event, no new lead was forthcoming from across the Atlantic, and prices
moved closely in ranges seen at the end of last week.
US Treasury prices weakened later yesterday as dealers and investors traded
cautiously ahead of this week's big auctions of new securities.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down  9/32 at 100 1/4 ,
yielding 8.008 per cent. It was the first time the yield had risen above 8
per cent since last autumn. The two-year note was down  1/32 at 98 31/32 ,
yielding 5.425 per cent.
Concern about the effect of today's sale of a record Dollars 14.25bn of
two-year notes and tomorrow's sale of another record Dollars 9.75bn of
five-year notes stems from the problems the market had in digesting the last
round of new supply. Retail investors were notably shy of the new securities
then, and the market is worried that if dealers are again left holding large
inventories prices could take a big tumble.
Adding to the market's unease yesterday was the feeling that today's
consumer confidence and auto sales figures will show improvement, further
reducing the likelihood of another interest rate cut.
EUROPE, meanwhile, continued to watch and wait for further signs of US
recovery. The most significant piece of news of the day - gross domestic
product figures from France - failed to move longer-dated bonds, although it
gave some support to shorter-dated paper.
The French GDP figures showed a flat picture, contrary to market
expectations of a 0.6 per cent increase. That put GDP growth for the year as
a whole at 1 per cent, well short of the 1.4 per cent predicted by the
French government as recently as last September.
However, hopes of a French interest rate cut were kept in check by the
memories, still fresh, of last autumn. Then, an interest rate cut had to be
reversed when the Bundesbank raised rates just before Christmas, and
market-watchers do not expect the French authorities to make the same
mistake again.
A QUIET day in both Germany and the UK was reflected in little trading on
the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe): 28,000 and
16,000 contracts each in the bund and gilt futures contracts respectively.
Domestic investors are not expected to buy bunds in the short term, at least
not as long as wage rise and strike fears continue to haunt the market.
In the UK, meanwhile, longer-dated gilts remained firm after market weakness
at the end of last week. The benchmark 2003/2007 bond closed up  1/32 point
on the day at 115 29/32 . According to one observer, traders had left
themselves short at the end of last week and helped to keep prices up
yesterday by buying in the face of general market weakness.
JAPANESE government bonds weakened as hopes of an imminent cut in interest
rates seemed to recede. Having opened in Tokyo slightly ahead of Friday,
when the yield on benchmark No 129 closed at 5.345 per cent. During the day,
however, prices slid as hoped-for intervention in the currency market to
support the yen failed to materialise.
Also, a move by the Bank of Japan to keep conditions in the money market
tight raised doubts about whether interest rates will be cut after the next
Tankan survey of industrial confidence, expected at the end of next week.
The No 129, having closed in Tokyo on a yield of 5.385 per cent, slid
further in London trading to close at 5.4 per cent.

THE chairman and vice-president of Cosmo Securities, a Japanese stockbroking
company, are to resign to take responsibility for a Y36bn (Dollars 280m)
loss suffered in a dispute with an investment client.
Cosmo accepted the loss in a court-mediated settlement with Skylark, a
restaurant operator which invested considerable amounts in securities
through Cosmo and other brokers.
The losses arose during the mishandling of complicated transfers of
securities by Cosmo from one client account to another. The transfers are
carried out near client company year-ends to avoid clients booking appraisal
losses.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Bank of Kuwait, the London-based consortium bank, has announced
pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.1m (Dollars 17.7m) for 1991, up from Pounds
5.5m in 1990, and written back Pounds 4.5m out of Pounds 13.5m worth of
provisions made against Kuwaiti and Iraqi exposure in the bank's 1990
accounts.
UBK, jointly owned by 13 Kuwaiti institutions, has taken the write-back and
after-tax profits of Pounds 6.2m into reserves, restoring them to pre-Gulf
war levels of Pounds 21m. UBK made an overall loss in 1990 of Pounds 9.9m
which it charged to reserves.
In addition to provisions against loans in Kuwait and Iraq, the bank
suffered a Pounds 4.4m loss on securities in 1990, largely certificates of
deposit, sold after the Iraqi invasion to increase liquidity.
The bank's overall footings fell in 1991 to Pounds 1.72bn from Pounds 1.96bn
largely as a result of the standstill in the Kuwait interbank market, where
UBK is traditionally highly active with local counterparties.
However, Mr Christopher Keen, general manager, said he expected footings to
recover above Pounds 2bn over this year as the Kuwait market revived. He
said the bank had performed well in its UK and US commercial and mortgage
operations.

MR FRANCIS YEUN, who recently resigned as chief executive of Hang Chong
Investments, the company acquired by Citic Pacific, has re-emerged on the
colony's corporate scene as a substantial shareholder and managing director
of Seapower International.
Mr Yeun, who resigned as chief executive of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
last year to run Hang Chong, has joined members of the consortium
participating in that company's takeover - most notably Mr Li Ka-shing, the
colony's leading financier, Mr Larry Yung, managing director of the
Beijing-controlled Citic Pacific, and Peregrine, the Hong Kong brokerage.
Seapower operates in financial services and the cold storage business. Since
the early 1980s it has been controlled by Mr Choi Sai Leung. He has been
described as a friend of Mr Yeun's and this reason was given as to why the
deal was done at Dollars HK1.60 a share - a 9 per cent discount to the
company's prevailing share price of Dollars HK1.76.
Mr Choi raised HKDollars 140.8m from the sale of 82m shares to Mr Yeun and
others, and immediately subscribed to 48m new shares in Seapower for a cost
of Dollars 77m.
Taking the enlarged capital base into account, a company owned 51 per cent
by Mr Yeun and 49 per cent by Peregrine has acquired a 20 per cent stake in
Seapower. Mr Li will end up with 9.67 per cent and Citic's Mr Yung, 3.6 per
cent.
Mr Choi will retain a 25 per cent stake in the company.

NORDSTROM, the Seattle-based group once seen as a star in the US retail
sector but which has stalled recently, yesterday reported an 11.7 per cent
drop in fourth-quarter profits to Dollars 40.9m after tax.
This compared with Dollars 46.3m seen in the same three-month period, to
end-January, a year earlier, and was scored on sales up by 8.4 per cent at
Dollars 978m.
The final quarter's figures leave Nordstrom with a Dollars 135.8m net profit
for the year, against Dollars 115.8m in the previous 12 months. Earnings at
the pre-tax level were Dollars 217.2m for the year (Dollars 178.3m), and
Dollars 64.1m (Dollars 70.1m) for the quarter.
The fashion speciality retailer conceded that the retail environment had
been difficult, and that the fourth quarter had been weaker than originally
anticipated. It blamed this on December's performance in particular, and
maintained that sales in southern California were proving especially
'challenging'.
The company has 68 stores in nine states at present, biased towards the West
Coast. It expects to open another three 'full-line' stores this year - in
Minnesota, New Jersey and Maryland - and two clearance outlets.

<TEXT>
IN A decision with broad consequences for the computer and semiconductor
industries, a California arbitrator has affirmed Advanced Micro Devices'
rights to continue to manufacture and market its own version of Intel's top
selling product, the 386 microprocessor.
The decision follows a five-year product licensing dispute between two of
the leading US semiconductor manufacturers, focussed upon AMD's claim that
Intel should have transferred its 386 design to AMD under a licensing
agreement between the companies.
The arbitrator ruled that AMD failed to produce products of equivalent
technical value in order to earn the rights to Intel's 386, and said that
Intel should not be forced to transfer the technology. Nonetheless, he ruled
that AMD should have the rights to manufacture and market its own version of
the 386 microprocessor. Intel disputed the licence portion of the decision,
claiming that the arbitrator has acted beyond his powers. AMD had also been
seeking Dollars 2.2 bn in damages from Intel. However, the arbitrator
awarded AMD only Dollars 15m.

MR GEORGE CONRADES, one of International Business Machines' top executives,
will leave the company at the end of the month. He is the second IBM senior
vice-president to announce plans to retire from the company this month.
Mr Conrades' departure follows his recent reassignment to a staff post, in
charge of corporate marketing and services. Previously, he was general
manager of IBM USA.
The move was widely seen as a demotion in the wake of IBM's poor performance
over the past year.
Coming on the heels of the resignation of Mr Michael Armstrong, chairman of
IBM World Trade, Mr Conrades' departure demonstrates the sweeping changes
that are under way within IBM as the company reorganises its operations in
an effort to boost its competitiveness and return to profitability.
A 31-year IBM veteran, who at various times has had charge of most of IBM's
largest product groups, Mr Conrades said a number of significant
opportunities outside IBM have recently been presented to him.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Express, the US charge card company, is, for the first time,
considering cutting the rate it charges some merchants who accept its cards.
It insists, however, the move is likely to affect 'a very small number.'
The company has faced highly-publicised revolts over the past year by some
groups of merchants who complain that it charges them a substantially higher
fee for bills paid with its cards than those levied by rivals Visa and
Mastercard.
Amexco has repeatedly refused to lower its rates, which provide a more
critical element of its income than that of Visa or Mastercard issuers, who
earn much of their profits from cardholders' interest payments.
Mr Harvey Golub, chairman of Amexco's card business, told travel agents in
Florida that the group was considering greater flexibility in its rates for
some merchants in special circumstances, such as those with highly seasonal
businesses.
An Amexco spokeswoman said rates reflected the amount of business a merchant
conducted through the company on an annual basis. This penalised seasonal
businesses, since their charges might be concentrated in just a few months
of the year.
She said any such change would only apply to 'very rare' cases and would
affect a minimal number of merchants using the Amexco card.
Amexco, she added, had no plans to alter its general pricing structure,
which depends on three main factors - a merchants' industry, charge card
volume, and whether the merchant submits charges electronically or by paper.
Nevertheless, the fact that Amexco is prepared to open up this chink in its
pricing structure in the hope of better relations with merchants, underlines
the intense competition it faces in the card industry, and the pressures
facing merchants' profits during a consumer recession.

The two Canadian airlines have been talking and the federal government has

losses and their combined debt load is more than USDollars 4bn.
Mr Harris said there was room for only one main Canadian airline. Air

FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: Murdoch takes command as Fox
chairman resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT MURDOCH is to assume direct management responsibility for Fox, the
Hollywood studio and television network, following the resignation of Mr
Barry Diller, chairman and chief executive since 1984.
The resignation, which Mr Diller yesterday insisted was amicable, still
caught the US entertainment industry by surprise.
Mr Diller, 50, one of the leading executives in Hollywood, has successfully
built the Fox Television Network, the fourth US national network and one
that boasts hits such as The Simpsons. He has also created Fox Broadcasting,
which delivers five nights of prime-time programming to 131 US television
stations.
Several entertainment industry insiders yesterday expressed scepticism about
whether Mr Murdoch - whose News Corporation interests include newspapers,
magazines and publishing as well as film and television - would actu-ally
assume a hands-on role at Fox.
Although Mr Murdoch has made Los Angeles one of his main residences, running
a Hollywood studio is considered by Wall Street analysts an unlikely role
for the Australian-born tycoon.
Although Mr Diller said he and Mr Murdoch had no disagreements, the
departing chairman did say he had told Mr Murdoch of his desire to own an
equity stake in Fox. This was not possible, Mr Diller said, since Fox is
wholly-owned by News Corporation.
Mr Diller said yesterday he had yearned 'to have my own company in whatever
shape or size I am comfortable or capable of creating or acquiring'. He said
he had held no direct talks about a future activity, but termed his decision
to resign 'a positive move'.
Speculation on Wall Street centred on whether Mr Diller might seek to put
together a company to make a bid to acquire NBC Television from General
Electric.
Another possibility raised by analysts was that Mr Diller might join forces
with Mr David Geffen, the record and film industry mogul, to launch a new
venture. Mr Diller described this as speculation, but added: 'David Geffen
is my friend. Who knows?'
News Corporation does not provide detailed figures for Fox, but the group's
last results showed ADollars 124.38m (USDollars 93.5m) of operating income
from television and ADollars 67.7m from filmed entertainment divisions, in
the six-month period to December 31.
Twentieth Century Fox, the film studio, is expected by analysts to earn
operating income of around USDollars 150m in the financial year to June 30,
while forecasts for Fox TV stations call for operating income of around
USDollars 160m in the same period.
The Fox Broadcasting division is expected to earn between USDollars 40m and
USDollars 50m in the financial year to June.

<TEXT>
SAAB Auto has reported a SKr1.39bn (Dollars 232m) loss, after financial
items, for 1991, down from a loss of SKr4.64bn in 1990. Sales rose 2 per
cent to SKr15.01bn, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm.
The final-quarter result was particularly heartening for the company, which
is jointly owned by Saab-Scania and General Motors of the US. This fell to a
loss of SKr134m from a SKr881m deficit last time.
The company said its recovery through 1991 reflected the fruits of a strong
productivity performance and extensive restructuring, including the closure
of Saab's Malmo plant and concentration of Swedish assembly operations at
Trollhattan.
It said it increased its share in important markets despite the impact of
depressed economic conditions on sales. In Sweden, market share rose to 9.6
per cent from 8.5 per cent in 1990. The figure was the highest recorded by
Saab Auto since 1986.

VIAG, the fast-growing German conglomerate, has revealed record sales and
profits for 1991. It said it was confident of further growth despite tough
economic conditions.
Profits after tax rose 20 per cent to DM405m (Dollars 245.4m), matching
company forecasts. Sales, however, fell short of predictions from Mr Georg
Obermeier, finance director, who in December promised a 25 per cent
increase.
Even so, turnover was up 22 per cent at DM23.7bn, thanks mainly to the
effect of acquisitions during the year.
Viag, which was formerly government-owned, has increased sales four-fold
since privatisation started in 1986.
Announcing the provisional 1991 results, the company said acquisitions made
during the year - notably the purchase of packaging group Continental Can
Europe - had helped it offset the effects of weaker performances in
chemicals and divisions supplying the iron and steel industry.
Aluminium sales also fell 10 per cent during the year. However the glass and
energy divisions improved.
The group, which is planning to float off a 49 per cent stake in its VAW
aluminium division, last year increased investment in the business by 53 per
cent to DM487m, fulfilling Mr Obermeier's promise to 'dress up the bride'.
VAW is awaiting monopolies clearance for its agreed bid for Eisenwerke
Bruhl, a motor components supplier.

At the same time as reporting a fall back into losses in the six months to

Ecopetrol, the Colombian state oil group.
First-half losses amounted to IPounds 1.01m (Pounds 934,000) pre-tax,

Losses per share were 0.37p (earnings 0.44p).

FT  25 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Principal Hotels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Principal Hotels Group, the shares of which were suspended last Friday while
the company's financial position was clarified, went into administrative
receivership last night with borrowings of more than Pounds 100m.
Mr Edward Klempka, a partner in Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte's Leeds office,
said: 'The hotels are viable. We will continue to expand until they can be
sold.' A management buy-out, trade sale or even reflotation are possible
options.
The Harrogate-based group has 19 hotels in Britain, two each Denmark and the
Netherlands and one in France.

<TEXT>
DALGETY, the food and agribusiness company, is to sell Modern Maid Food
Products, its US food coatings business, to DCA Food Industries, a US
subsidiary of Allied-Lyons, for Dollars 41m (Pounds 23.4m) cash, writes Guy
de Jonquieres.
Dalgety, which plans to use the proceeds to reduce borrowings, said it had
decided to sell Modern Maid because its food ingredients strategy was to
focus on Europe.
Modern Maid supplies batters, breadcrumbs and speciality coatings to food
processors and sells prepared flour and baking mixes to fast food and
catering outlets. It made a Dollars 4.6m trading profit on sales of Dollars
42m in the year to June and had net assets of Dollars 11.7m.

FT  25 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BZW revises accounting bulletin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of Barclays, the UK
clearing bank, yesterday issued an emasculated version of its circular on
changes in UK accounting policy which created an embarrassing storm of
protest when a draft was first circulated earlier this month.
The bulletin describes the changes in accounting standards currently being
introduced by the Accounting Standards Board, and presents some analysis of
their implications.
An earlier draft, which was never officially released, though details of it
were reported in the press, gave examples of five companies in which
earnings figures would be significantly different if re-drafted under the
new standards.
News of the analysis affected the share price of the companies concerned -
Fisons, P&amp;O, Ladbroke, Cable &amp; Wireless and British Airways.
It is also believed to have generated angry letters and phone calls from
some of these companies, putting BZW under pressure to withdraw its
document.
BZW was at pains yesterday to distance itself from the earlier draft, which
it said had been misinterpreted. Copies of this document have been recalled
and shredded.
However, a copy obtained by the Financial Times, shows that the report says
the companies complied with existing accounting standards, but under the
changes their results would be shown 'in less favourable light'.
In each case, earnings would have been lower using the new standards.
The companies involved claimed when the report was withdrawn that the
analysis contained inaccuracies, although they refused to elaborate.
The new report simply contains some abstract examples of the impact of the
accounting changes, and lists certain characteristics sensitive to the
changes.
These include cash absorption, substantial profits derived from acquisitions
and disposals, large non-recurring costs and significant amounts of
off-balance sheet financing.

FT  25 FEB 92 / GM loss of Dollars 4.5bn sets US record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS yesterday reported a 1991 loss of Dollars 4.5bn, (Pounds
2.57bn) the largest annual loss ever recorded by a US company. It also named
a dozen plants which are to be closed and announced a shake-up of management
structure designed to restore its North American operations to profit.
The loss - below many analysts' expectations, which ranged as high as
Dollars 5bn to Dollars 6bn - included a Dollars 1.8bn after-tax charge,
taken in the fourth quarter, to cover a significant restructuring plan
announced by the company last December.
This involves the closure of 21 plants and a 74,000 reduction in GM's
workforce by the mid-1990s, mainly through attrition and early retirement.
Yesterday GM ended two months of uncertainty by adding 12 new plant names to
the two it previously announced would be closed. They include two car
assembly plants, in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and North Tarrytown, New York,
employing a total of 7,470. An engine plant in Flint, Michigan, employing
4,036 will also be closed.
GM, the world's largest motor manufacturer, has been hit hard by the US
recession, which has sharply cut demand for cars at a time when growing
production in the US by Japanese rivals has created excess demand.
The company said it had a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 2.47bn, or
Dollars 4.25 a share, on sales of Dollars 30.4bn, after the special charge.
This compared with a loss of Dollars 1.6bn, or Dollars 2.89, on revenues of
Dollars 26.4bn in 1990.
Mr Robert Stempel, chairman, said the fourth-quarter Dollars 520m operating
loss represented a significant improvement over the previous four quarters,
and this was due partly to cost-cutting efforts.
'We are committed to substantially resizing GM's North American operations
to achieve full competitiveness as quickly as possible,' Mr Stempel added.
'I expect GM's quarterly earnings to improve into 1992.'
In spite of his remarks, GM shares sunk in trading on Wall Street to close
at Dollars 37 3/4 , down Dollars  5/8 on the day.
The company's Dollars 4.5bn full-year loss broke the US record for annual
red ink set in 1987 by Texaco, the oil company, which reported a Dollars
4.1bn loss.
The GM figures compared with the group's losses of Dollars 2bn in 1990, when
it took a Dollars 2.1bn after-tax charge for plant closings.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Scottish constitutional stance may be reviewed by Tories
says Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR hinted yesterday that the government would review its
opposition to constitutional change for Scotland if the Conservatives won
the general election.
He said in a BBC radio interview recorded during his weekend visit to
Scotland: 'I have come to Scotland to set out the case for maintaining the
union in all its aspects . . . After the election we will take stock. For
the moment that's what I've done, that's all I have done and I'm going no
further.'
In a speech in Glasgow Mr Major urged Scots to reject independence and
devolution, and extolled the virtues of the union of the United Kingdom and
the role of Scotland within it. While only a minority of Scottish Tories
support constitutional change, many believe the party might have to change
its policy if it loses some of its nine Scottish seats in the general
election.
There was no sign of a change of policy from Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish
secretary, when he opened a five-hour debate on Scotland's constitutional
position at the Scottish Grand Committee of Scottish MPs in Edinburgh.
The debate, in the chamber built for the Scottish assembly planned by the
last Labour government, produced few new arguments. It was marked by
acrimony between Labour, which wants a devolved Scottish parliament, and the
Scottish National party, urging independence.
Mr Lang attacked the funding structure for Labour's planned parliament,
saying even if it were assigned all income tax and VAT raised in Scotland,
that was 'less than half of total identifiable public expenditure in
Scotland and less than a third of total government expenditure in Scotland'.
Even if the Scottish parliament, as Labour had said, imposed an extra 3p on
income tax in Scotland, it would only raise 2.5 per cent of government
revenue in Scotland.
In a whole range of ways, he said, 'a Scottish parliament would run amok
among the business and individual taxpayers of Scotland, to fund the
policies that would bring her to her knees'.
Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow Scottish secretary, defended Labour's proposals
for a Scottish parliament. Scots would be 'governed by representatives they
elect and will retain our links with the other countries which make up the
UK'.
Mr Lang, he said, 'always agonises over the impact of a Scottish parliament
on the UK. He never considers the damage being done to Scotland by the
present system'.
Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the SNP, said that a devolved Scottish parliament
would be unstable, as was the status quo. A devolved Scottish parliament
would depend for more than 90 per cent of its income on the discretion of
Westminster.
It would have little say in Scotland's dealing with the EC.

FT  25 FEB 92 / De Klerk sets March 17 for referendum on reforms: S African
president seeks mandate to scrap apartheid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S whites will vote on March 17 to decide whether to replace
apartheid with a negotiated new constitution.
The referendum will determine the future of political reform and of the
country's president, Mr FW de Klerk.
'I have to know that those who gave me a mandate in the first place are
still standing by me,' Mr de Klerk said in a televised address as he
announced the date of the poll and the referendum question.
Voters will be asked: 'Do you support continuation of the reform process
which the state president began on 2nd February, 1990, and which is aimed at
a new constitution through negotiation?'
The president made clear the referendum would be the last chance for whites
to stop the process of reform; no further poll would be held to ratify a
negotiated constitution.
The prospect of such a poll had become a point of contention between
Pretoria and the African National Congress.
The white supremacist Conservative party was meeting last night to decide
whether to boycott the poll, on the grounds that its leaders were not
consulted in drawing up the question and because the government has refused
to count votes by constituency, a method favouring the party.
Conservative supporters would be expected to vote 'no' in the poll, because
their party opposes negotiated power-sharing with blacks.
But the vote will also pit the personality of the charismatic and shrewd Mr
de Klerk against that of the dour Mr Andries Treurnicht, the Conservative
leader.
A Conservative boycott would represent a tacit defeat, and would
substantially reduce the party's influence over white politics.
Recent opinion polls have shown that Mr de Klerk commands majority support
among whites, and the only other large white party, the liberal Democratic
party, has given him its backing.
Daily newspapers have declared their support for Mr de Klerk, and the state
broadcasting media is likely to favour the ruling National party, with its
campaign of 'vote Nationalist or vote war'. Mr de Klerk has said he and his
government will resign if he loses the vote.
Mr de Klerk said yesterday he expected a 'yes' vote from those who wanted a
constitution which would 'eliminate discrimination on the basis of race and
offer all South Africans democratic participation: but also a constitution
which will offer adequate security in respect of the maintenance of
important values, which will be able to protect certain vested rights and
which will prevent any abuse of power effectively'.
Mr de Klerk said his National party would seek ways to protect white rights
in a new constitution through power-sharing and guarantees of property
rights.
The ANC yesterday detailed its proposals for a multiracial interim
government, which contained reassurances for whites frightened of majority
black rule.
Mr Thabo Mbeki, a senior ANC leader, said he believed an agreement could be
reached by April on an interim government.
The ANC envisages an interim government council formed from the 19 parties
and groups attending the talks, known as the Convention for a Democratic
South Africa (Codesa). The council would supervise the security forces and
other key government departments which would temporarily remain under their
present ministers.
A separate, neutral electoral commission would be set up. Universal suffrage
elections for a constituent assembly, based on proportional representation,
should be held within six months of the council being set up and the
assembly should finish its work within nine months. The constituent assembly
would act as an interim parliament.

WALES appears to be following in the footsteps of Scotland and moving
towards increased support for an elected assembly with devolved powers along
the lines advocated by the Labour party.
A poll commissioned by the Western Mail newspaper in conjunction with S4C,
the Welsh fourth TV channel, indicated 47 per cent favoured an elected
assembly with only 31 per cent against and 21 per cent dont-knows.
The poll, which was conducted by NOP, found that the creation of a Scottish
assembly would increase support for devolution for Wales to 61 per cent with
24 per cent against and 14 per cent don't knows. In the 1979 referendum on
devolution, when the vote was four-to-one against an assembly.

FT  25 FEB 92 / North Sea operators face tough new safety measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TOUGH new safety regime, which will take North Sea operators' costs of
improving safety to more than Pounds 1.7bn, were recommended yesterday by
the Health and Safety Commission (HSC), which is part of the Health and
Safety Executive.
The draft regulations flow from the inquiry chaired by Lord Cullen into the
1988 Piper Alpha explosion and fire in which 167 workers died and which
caused the industry to rethink its approach to safety.
The recommendations have been put out for consultation before being
submitted to government. It is expected they will become law next year.
Operators in the North Sea welcomed the document but said they would
question some aspects, including a regulation that could result in operators
having to provide standard temporary safe refuges on unmanned installations.
Lord Cullen in his report recommended technological innovations to improve
safety, such as the installation of emergency shutdown valves. The industry
estimates it has spent more than Pounds 1bn on hardware since the report was
published.
He also urged a revamp in the way safety was managed and called for a move
away from measures taken in the past, where safety regulations would be laid
down in minute detail, to a more flexible regime which left individual
companies to develop their own guidelines.
Under the new draft regulations, which implement 30 of the 106
recommendations set by Lord Cullen, operators will have to submit a 'safety
case', details of how they plan to make the changes, for each installation
by next year. These must then be accepted by the HSC. Other Cullen
guidelines will be incorporated in future HSC regulations.
The HSC estimates that the overall cost of modifying installation will be
about Pounds 1.75bn, most of which has already been spent or committed by
operators. The HSC estimates it will cost companies initially in excess of
Pounds 115m to prepare safety plans for the 230 installations in the North
Sea. Ongoing costs for new installations and updating safety plans have been
estimated at between Pounds 4.5m and Pounds 11m a year.
Trade unions with members offshore welcomed the recommendations. Mr Jimmy
Airlie, Scottish executive member of the AEU, the engineering union, said:
'This report vindicates our long campaign to improve health and safety
offshore. The implementation of these new procedures cannot come soon
enough.'

FT  25 FEB 92 / Philips faces its moment of truth: The company's emphasis on
consumer electronics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Jan Timmer, president of Philips, unveils last year's results on
Thursday, he will highlight the group's shift in emphasis towards consumer
electronics and reveal to what extent it has recovered from the black year
of 1990.
That year, which saw record losses of Fl 4.24bn (Pounds 1.3bn), prompted an
ambitious restructuring: non-core businesses have been disposed of and the
company's technological strengths have been brought to bear on new consumer
products. This week's news is expected to show that, while the company made
a small profit last year, the revival has largely been the result of
cost-cutting rather than success in new products, many of which are still in
the planning stage.
The group's assessment of how it fared in its year of reckoning is of
interest not only to investors worried about its financial health. As one of
the few remaining diversified European electrical and electronics companies,
Philips is a champion of a cause - the maintenance of an independent
European capability in electronic technologies.
As such, its ability to turn its financial fortunes around will have
consequences extending far beyond the boundaries of the group's home town of
Eindhoven, in the Netherlands. It will also show whether Europe will be able
to maintain electronics concerns that can compete globally.
A year ago, Mr Timmer made a resounding pronouncement about shaking the
group back into competitiveness and returning it to long-term profitability.
In the first nine months of 1991, 24,200 jobs - about 9 per cent of the
total - were cut. Changes in top management, including the replacement of
the head of the consumer electronics division, have been implemented.
The aim of his corporate strategy, as gleaned by the divestments and
investments he has made since becoming president nearly two years ago, has
been to bolster the predominance of consumer electronics in the group's
businesses.
Last year, Philips disposed of its loss-making information systems division;
sold off its remaining stake in Whirlpool International, its white goods
business; and pulled out of its telecommunications joint venture with AT&amp;T.
The moves were welcomed as indicating a new-found willingness to take tough
decisions.
The picture that emerges is of a group in which the technology-driven
strategy that made Philips, the great innovator, a loser on the high street,
is being replaced by a more market-driven initiative.
The central element of this strategy, the focus on consumer electronics, is
hardly surprising. The division represents nearly half the group's revenues,
accounting for 45 per cent of total revenues of Fl 55.8bn in 1990.
What is new, however, is the greater emphasis on software, such as music
recordings and videos, and expansion of the group's distribution network.
This strategy clearly emerges in Mr Timmer's most eye-catching investments.
This month, he agreed to spend Dollars 175m on a 25 per cent stake in
Whittle Communications, the US media company - a step towards a 33 per cent
holding. Philips sees Whittle as a vehicle for promoting one of its latest
products, Compact Disc-Interactive (CD-I), a CD player which, when hooked to
a television set, allows the viewer to combine sound, image and graphics.
Whittle already enjoys unusual access to US schoolchildren - a prime
potential market for CD-I's educational applications - through its 12-minute
news programme called Channel One, which it beams to nearly 9,000 US high
schools (partly with the help of Philips equipment) every day.
The US investment is part of Philips' wider efforts to ensure not only that
consumers have the necessary software to run on their Philips hardware, but
also that the company will be in a position to control the outlets for that
software.
To this end, Mr Timmer has concentrated the group's relatively scarce
resources in building up a network of interests in the video-rental business
in continental Europe, the UK and the US. This emphasis has been
controversial, partly because Philips was itself making losses in video
rental and was forced to rescue Super Club, the loss-making Belgian chain in
which it had a stake.
But this web of interests in video rental will give it access to thousands
of 'software' outlets in north America and north-west Europe, which it hopes
to use to promote new "hardware' like CD-I.
Philips increasingly sees software as a valuable activity in its own right,
both as a source of dependable profits and a counter-weight to consumer
hardware price wars.
Although Philips does not break down profits by product group, its 80 per
cent stake in PolyGram, the London-based music company, has in recent years
been a main source of profits in consumer products.
It now evidently assumes that having influence over the software played on
its video-cassette recorders and televisions will be equally lucrative: it
frequently cites 1989 figures from the US showing that consumers spent
Dollars 9.5bn on video software that year, Dollars 500m more than they spent
on TV sets.
But while Philips's new market-driven strategy marks a bold departure, the
impact has yet to be felt on the company's profits. The group's performance
in 1991, its centenary year, is expected to show that, while Mr Timmer and
his management team have made some progress, there is still a long way to
go. Recession in many of its principal markets and the difficulties in
changing attitudes in the company's large bureaucracy have slowed the
benefits of restructuring.
An unexpectedly strong swing back into profitability in the first three
quarters of last year has raised hopes. A loss of Fl 2.2bn in the third
quarter of 1990, for example, was transformed into profits of Fl 188m in the
same period in 1991.
But a careful scrutiny of the numbers indicates that the improvement is due
largely to the benefits of having taken out a big slice of costs in the form
of staff cuts. The costs of the restructuring were taken as provisions
against profits in 1990 - an important factor in the group's losses that
year.
More worrying, profits in the consumer electronics division, which comprise
more than 40 per cent of group revenue, have been slipping steadily
throughout the year as increased competition in a recessionary environment
has eaten into margins.
In spite of the cost reductions achieved so far, the group is still highly
indebted and financing costs last year are expected to be as high as 50 per
cent of operating profits.
This level of financing costs is crippling at a time when new products, such
as CD-I and high definition television, still require large investments.
HDTV investment is likely to cost several hundred million guilders.
Unless financing costs can be brought down, they will have a lasting impact
not only on profitability over the next few years but also on the company's
ability to stay ahead in product innovation, says Mr Peter Knox, electronics
analyst at stockbroker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
With shareholders increasingly vocal in their criticism of Philips'
management, the company can no longer afford to take such a long-term view
of its investment in product development, admits one Philips official.
The combination of the group's financial pressures and the need to placate
shareholders means that Mr Timmer will need to perform a careful balancing
act when he declares the company's dividend policy in two days' time.
If analysts are right and Philips fixes the 1991 dividend at about Fl 0.50
compared with its last pay-out of Fl 2 in 1989, the message to staff and to
investors will be clear: some progress has been made but a lot needs to be
done.
The real test will come in the next two to three years. This will be 'own-up
time' for the group, as one spokesman for the company puts it. During the
period, at least one of the technologies that Philips has been pouring money
into - DCC, wide screen TV and CD-I - must reap profits.
Unless the group can deliver in that time, Philips could return to the gloom
of 1990. It would then have to face a much more radical shake-up than Mr
Timmer's current exercise.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Letter: More a grande dame than a woman down at heel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr HELENE SEPPAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Rogaly, in his column 'Beurre Heseltine' (February 21), describes
Mrs Margaret Thatcher as 'She who regarded herself as the sole bonne femme'.
I cannot believe this to be true. Une bonne femme denotes a total lack of
sophistication, namely a woman down at heel and rather vulgar.
Mrs Thatcher may well have seen herself as the sole grande dame as she
assumed the airs of an absolutist monarch. I suggest that He who regards
himself as un homme du monde should first check his French.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Arts heritage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'NATIONAL heritage in danger' is a moving cry. But is it a convincing one?
True, Hans Holbein's Portrait of a Lady with a Pet Squirrel and a Starling
is on the auction block and Canova's three luscious lovelies are threatened
by a fate worse than death. Like the Badminton Cabinet, Constable's The
Lock, Van Dyck's First Duke of Hamilton and many others, these works may
leave British shores.
Yet what have these works - some by great masters, some by lesser ones; one
English, the rest continental; some by artists who worked in England, others
by artists who did not - in common? Why are they all part of the British
'national heritage'?
The answer to that question is simply possession. The work might have been
unknown to the public and be British in nothing bar ownership, but it was
there. Possession may be nine-tenths of the law, but must any work of art of
foremost importance stay there forever? By the same logic, foreign
masterpieces should not have been exported to the UK in the first place.
Works of art by British artists belong more obviously to the 'national
heritage', but should works by Turner or Constable not be seen and enjoyed
around the world? And do those who want works by national artists to stay in
the UK accept that works of Italian, Spanish, Dutch or German masters
should, for the very same reason, have stayed in their native lands?
Trade in works of art has allowed the British to accumulate stores of
artistic wealth greatly in excess of the value of its own output. But the
wealth that made that possible has now departed. That is not a reason for
forcing owners of great treasures to supply national collections on the
cheap. It is a good reason for accepting that the people of other nations
are also entitled to acquire the cultural artefacts that are among the
principal blessings of wealth.
Unless 'national heritage' means mere possession, it is an empty phrase.
Works of art are the heritage of mankind. What is more, if exported, they
will not be 'lost'. They will, on the contrary, be gained by others no less
deserving and usually far worse endowed.
If the UK values these works as much as those who are panting to acquire
them, it should pay the market price. If it does not, let them go to others
who will appreciate them no less and seem to want them even more.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Arts: A double enigma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The progress of the period instrument ensembles of the baroque, starting
from Bach and Handel, moving inexorably forwards to Mozart, until they felt
confident enough even to make the occasional foray into Schumann,
Mendlessohn and Brahms, was among the most important features of musical
life in the 1980s. But their advance may be about to be halted.
Last week a new period romantic orchestra took the stage for the first time,
setting its standard flying over the music of the turn of the century, where
it intends to stake out its ground. Taking the name of the New Queen's Hall
Orchestra after Henry Wood's orchestra founded in 1895, it uses gut strings
and narrowbore brass instruments, while promising period style generally - a
feature easily assimilated from 78rpm recordings.
This first concert, at St John's Smith Square on Friday, featured the
strings alone, although wind and brass sections were due to join them at
another event out of London the next night. The programme consisted of four
favourite pieces for string orchestra, which should have made for a
pleasurable but uncontroversial evening; and so the mixed feelings that it
generated came as all the greater surprise.
Doubts and dissatisfaction mingled here with a very real fascination as to
what the performances were trying to tell us. The sound, at least, was
marvellous: a blend of rich sonorities, the higher strings sweeter than
usual, the lower warmly resonant, far removed from the string sound of
today's orchestras and thereby justifying the enterprise. But that surely
does not mean that the playing also has to be as uniformly sluggish and
cumbersome as it was here.
Of the four pieces, under the direction of James Judd, Vaughan Williams's
Fantasia on a theme of Thomas Tallis easily worked the best, thanks to the
combination of the orchestra's tone colours and the spacious acoustic of St
John's. Neither Dvorak's nor Elgar's Serenades for strings had much
vitality, while Tchaikovsky's limped along with barely any passion at all.
Was it the conductor, the players, the instruments, or a lack of rehearsal
time?
Difficult to say, although the names of the musicians printed in the
programme suggest that this is an ensemble with some very experienced
members, and one would not normally have expected from them the infelicities
of ensemble and tuning that marred these performances. Perhaps orchestras,
especially new 'old' ones, are just not born in a day. The New Queen's Hall
Orchestra has shown it is more than a gimmick and one at least looks forward
to its next appearance with genuine interest.
* * *
The following night another enigma was set to be challenged at an all-Elgar
programme at the Royal Festival Hall. There has long been speculation about
the so-called 'hidden' theme that Elgar claimed lies behind the Enigma
Variations and one recent claimant to be the answer was tried out in public
before a performance of the work on Saturday.
This solution, proposed by Joseph Cooper and seconded by Dr Jerrold Northrop
Moore, the Elgar scholar, suggests that Elgar's main theme is in fact a
re-working of part of the slow movement of Mozart's 'Prague' Symphony. The
theme bears some of the same notes and similarities in rhythm, while Elgar's
love for the music of Mozart and his use of it in his early days as an
exemplar towards composing large-scale musical structures are duly noted.
Whether this is enough, however, to add up to Elgar's description of the
hidden theme as 'another and larger theme' going through and over the whole
set of variations seems highly questionable. As with the premises of the New
Queen's Hall Orchestra concert, what we were being offered here was merely
one possible answer to the enigma, for which in this case there is no
documentary explanation.
This time the performances, by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under
Charles Mackerras, were according to late 20th-century standards, both as to
style and execution. Good playing generally, with all the brilliance of
sound and ensemble that a top orchestra today can easily muster. It would
certainly be a shame if the qualities that make Mackerras's Elgar so
enjoyable - its vitality, clarity and quickness of response - were to become
a thing of the past. Elgar's own recordings suggest there is no reason why
they should.

FT  25 FEB 92 / The Mood of Britain: It's a nightmare on Acacia Avenue but
boom time in Medomsley Road - Michael Cassell finds continued problems in
north-east England on the second stage of his pre-election trip around
Britain / Tyneside's Meadow Well estate gives the lie to any claims of
universal progress and well-being in modern Britain. It defies those who
profess to seek remedies for the most intractable social and economic
problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE STREET names conjure up images of suburban, south-east gentility. But
Dorking, Didcot and Tonbridge Avenues represent the worst kind of
neighbourhood nightmare.
Barrack-style terraces of council homes, some boarded up and others
burned-out, line the roads at the heart of North Tyneside's Meadow Well
estate. Riots here in the autumn brought public uproar and unwelcome
notoriety.
'Nothing's changed round here. Nothing likely to,' muses Pat Moore, who
cruises the area in a battered flat-bed truck touting for scrap.
He laughs through tombstone-sized teeth at a torrent of abuse accusing him
of taking anything that is not bolted down. On Tyneside, even sets of
temporary traffic lights go missing, kidnapped for use in DIY discos.
Moore considers himself lucky not to live on the Meadow Well. He hails from
nearby Wallsend, where they launched the Mauretania, the ocean-going liner,
fitted out in a luxury unimaginable to its builders. Now, the town is famed
as the birthplace of Sting, the pop singer with an inspirational
rags-to-riches life story; these days he prefers London's leafy Highgate.
Many might suppose that the 'rags-to-riches' order has been reversed in
north-east England, once dubbed the cradle of 'carboniferous capitalism',
but more recently regarded as a state-dependent province populated by
Margaret Thatcher's 'moaning minnies'.
While it is not at all representative of a region struggling to break free
from its past, the Meadow Well - christened by some hopeful soul unburdened
by a sense of irony - reeks of despair and decay. It gives the lie to any
claims of universal progress and well-being in modern Britain. It defies
those who profess to seek remedies for the most intractable social and
economic problems.
Only the foolhardy would inquire here about the benefits recent years have
brought. On the Meadow Well nearly every home needs jobs and the only
benefits come in a book stamped Department of Social Security. The welfare
state is thriving here.
At the other end of Newcastle upon Tyne lies further deprivation. In the
city's West End, tyre tracks burned into the road trace the exploits of
daredevil delinquents. Nearly a quarter of children live with only one
parent and a similar proportion plays daily truant from school; half of
those aged under 24 are out of work.
With his wife the only breadwinner, Rakesh Chopra watches over the washing
and two noisy children in Westgate Hill Launderette off the Elswick Road. 'I
worked very hard but the factory moved away,' he says. 'They said I could
go, but there was not a home, so we have to stay.' Rakesh Chopra, it seems,
could not get on his bike.
Things look brighter just across the Tyne in Gateshead. JB Priestley
remarked that if anyone ever made money in Gateshead they had been careful
not to spend it there. Now, however, there is the MetroCentre, a vast
shopping shrine which has become a cliche for Geordie self-confidence,
luring bargain-hunters from as far afield as Oslo and Reykjavik.
But in spite of the deep and continuing antipathy in the region towards
Thatcher's values, the former prime minister made her mark. The north-east
was, reluctantly perhaps, gradually remoulded during her years in power.
Joe Mills, regional secretary of the TGWU general workers' union, recalls:
'She came up here and made it clear we'd get nowt for nowt. She said she
owed us nothing and if we wanted things to improve we'd have to damn well
fight for it.'
Mills, a board member of the Tyne and Wear Urban Development Corporation,
claims the fight was well under way before Thatcher's handbag swung into
town, but he acknowledges the region was stung into renewed action by her
attitude.
Mills' dual role neatly reflects the progress which has been made to unite
parties which traditionally stood on opposite sides of almost any argument.
Critics of the new partnership are angered by a perceived betrayal of old
allegiances. Promotional slogans such as 'the great north', aimed at the
rising number of inward investors, often elicit sneering cynicism. Most
people, however, welcome increasing co-operation between industry, councils
and regeneration agencies to replace the shipyards, coal mines and
heavy-engineering factories.
John Ward, regional director of Barclays Bank, says: 'There has been an
incredible change in attitudes in the last 10 years. The begging bowl
approach has gone. There is real partnership now, with business talking to
Labour-controlled councils displaying a refreshing pragmatism. Everyone is
pulling in the same direction and the enterprise culture has rubbed off.'
Professor Peter Taylor of Newcastle University reckons most people in
north-east England spent half the 1980s believing Thatcherism was inherently
evil and would just go away.
'Everyone waited for Labour to come back and put things right with
large-scale state solutions,' he says. 'But the agenda has changed and now
they are trying to get things done for themselves.'
John Tomaney, from the city's centre for urban and regional development
studies, sees a waning solidarity within the working class between those in
employment and those without jobs: 'They all used to stick together and help
each other out but now those in work are gradually distancing themselves
from the others.'
John Lee, a steelworker for 35 years whose skills were scrapped along with
the Consett works more than a decade ago, sees it happening all around him.
'My neighbour wasn't young when the plant shut and he has been out of a job
ever since. Many things have been pulled down, but they have not been
replaced by the training programmes and cash needed to rebuild jobs and
lives.'
He admits that, in the good old bad old days, unions and management spent
most of their energies fighting each other and needed their heads banging
together. But he still claims Consett did not need to close.
For some, new opportunities arose out of misfortune. Lee now works as a
probation officer in Consett, where the clinging red dust from the steel
works finally lifted to reveal a new generation of biotechnology companies,
plastics manufacturers and food processing specialists; for special steels
now read Phileas Fogg tortilla chips, produced by Derwent Valley Foods of
Medomsley Road.
The victims of some closures have tried to make it on their own, using
redundancy cash and enterprise allowance funds to run fish and chip shops or
sub-post offices. For some the gamble was regarded more as a last resort
than a confident, new beginning. Many would-be entrepreneurs quickly fail.
Not all, however. Six years ago, a redundant Robin Edgell set up a small
laundry service supplying companies around Durham. He has no regrets: 'I'm
not much better off and work twice as hard but I love being my own boss.'
Edgell says he used to vote Labour but now they are 'too quick to give with
one hand and take back with the other'. He adds: 'They talk as though
reasonable people won't mind paying a bit more tax. I'm sorry but I want to
pay less.'
Edgell would next like to try supplying the new industrial giants such as
Nissan at Washington. At the gates of the car manufacturing fortress,
workers decline to talk about employers with alien names and attitudes:
'Can't slag them off any more. They take it too personally.'
Further south, away from the land of the rising sun and the single-union
deal, lies Sacriston, a dismal, hilltop village where coalmining started in
1350 and ended in 1985. An old pit wheel stands in the town centre as a
reminder of things past.
Ian Tressler, a young storeman who wants to live in London, says Japanese
employers would be very welcome locally: 'We'll get karaoke down the pub and
make them feel at home. If they bring jobs with them, they'll never have to
buy their own pint.'
The rest of the articles in Michael Cassell's series will appear throughout
this week.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Honda picks 136 'local' suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONDA has appointed 136 European and two US component manufacturers to
supply parts for its new car range to be built at its nearly completed
Pounds 300m factory at Swindon, Wiltshire.
UK suppliers have, as expected, gained the majority of the European supply
contracts for the Synchro range which it will start building in October. The
cars will have 60 per cent 'local' or European content at the start of
production, rising to a scheduled 80 per cent by mid 1994.
The 89 UK-based suppliers include most of the industry's biggest names. BBA
subsidiary Automotive Products is to supply clutch assemblies; five Lucas
Automotive divisions are to supply parts ranging from brake systems to
wiring harnesses; Hardy Spicer is to supply driveshafts; Unipart
subsidiaries Premier Exhausts and Oxford Automotive Components exhaust
systems, catalytic converters and fuel tanks.
Honda told a Swindon meeting of the suppliers that it will spend Pounds 500m
with them annually when the plant reaches its target output of 100,000 cars
a year in the mid 1990s. This figure is based on the output of Synchro and
the replacement for Honda's Concerto model, currently built by its Rover
Group partner at Longbridge.
The sourcing of both models exclusively from Swindon, and indications from
Honda that company spending on European components could rise to Pounds
600m-Pounds 800m, has increased expectations that Honda will move to
substantially higher output levels at Swindon from the late 1990s. The
Concerto's replacement is due to go into production by 1995.
Honda said yesterday that initial Synchro output would be left-hand drive
for Continental markets, with right-hand drive versions for the UK not
becoming available until May 1993. The first cars will go on sale in Germany
in January.
The plant, which occupies a 360-acre site a few miles from Swindon, is
expected to produce about 30,000 cars next year. Of the non-UK nominated
suppliers, 19 are from France, including the Valeo group; 13 from Germany;
four from Italy; two each from Spain, Belgium, Ireland and Austria; and one
each from Portugal, Denmark and Sweden.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics (Campaign Profile): Preacher turned
party propagandist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRIS PATTEN is a thoroughly nice man who has become a thoroughly nasty
politician.
A year ago, the Conservative party chairman chose the now-defunct Marxism
Today as the vehicle for his vision of moderate post-Thatcherite
Conservatism. Now he spends his time shining a torch on ageing reds under
Labour beds.
His enemies (and it is only recently that the numbers in the Labour party
have outstripped those on the Tory right) declare that a once affable,
intelligently irreverent approach to politics has been subsumed in tawdry
ambition.
Friends (and there are still plenty) talk of a purely temporary
transformation. No chairman fighting the toughest general election since
1974 could avoid getting his hands dirty. 'It's a bloody awful job and I
can't imagine he is enjoying it,' says a soulmate. But if Chris (as everyone
calls him) returns to an appropriately senior cabinet post after the
election, the old, tolerant, intellectualism will reassert itself.
Mr Major's appointment of the 47-year-old MP for Bath to the chairmanship of
the party infuriated the dispossessed right of his party.
Here was the author of The Tory Case - the sharpest critique of Thatcherism
produced from her own side during the 1980s - charged with winning for Mr
Major the fourth election victory which she had been so cruelly denied.
Within weeks, Mr Patten was living up to their worst fears - providing a
political rhetoric which distanced the prime minister from his predecessor
and, horror of horrors, cuddling up to German Christian Democracy.
That, though, was back in the days when it seemed that, with a new leader
and a softer focus, the Conservatives had to wait only for the tide of
economic recovery to carry them back to power. Now they have a real fight on
their hands. To win they must discredit the Labour alternative. To
opposition cries of 'hypocrite' Mr Patten has deserted the high ground of
political philosophy for the mud of negative campaigning.
The serious thinker now turns out the sort of racy propaganda that can
embarrass even his clients at the Tory tabloids. Early most mornings, he can
be found hosting a ministerial press conference from behind a long, shocking
blue platform at Conservative central office. Bleary-eyed journalists look
on slightly bemused as the party chairman charts the horrors which await
them under Labour.
There is the 'tax bombshell' which would rob every family of at least Pounds
1,000 a year of their income and then raid their savings. There are the
handcuffs which lock Mr Neil Kinnock to his union paymasters. Then there are
the secret CND sympathisers who would leave Britain defenceless in the face
of whatever has replaced the Soviet threat.
We do not have to take Mr Patten's word for it. Every charge is documented
minutely in a torrent of research papers which might have extracted a
sizeable chunk from the Brazilian rain forest which he is so committed to
saving.
Opposition leaders are quoted to show how frequently they have changed their
minds, underpinning the theme: 'You can't trust Labour.' It is slick and
professional. It looks as if it has cost an awful lot of money.
Chris makes no excuses for the campaign, designed by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in a
style that can best be described as late 1970s brutalist. Nor can Labour
claim that the charges are more extravagant than their own - Mr Major does
not want to privatise the National Health Service, for example.
Mr Patten's central assertion is that for all its slick public relations
respectability, Labour's instincts remain rooted in the discredited statism
which the rest of the world has abandoned.
His aim is to get across to the voters the fundamental 'dishonesty' of a
strategy which promises to shower money on public services yet put up the
taxes of only a wealthy minority.
The sums do not add up. It is entirely legitimate to question a commitment
to the 'market' if at nearly every mention it is qualified by the word
'failure'.
Then there are the unions and the left. Mr Norman Willis and Mr Tony Benn
might seem harmless eccentrics as long as the Conservatives are in
government. But they would extract their dues if Labour scraped into power.
The sub-text is obvious. Mr Major has proved himself an honest, open and
consistent leader. You see what you get. Mr Kinnock is shifty, opportunist.
He could easily change his mind again.
All this, of course, has to be conveyed to the voters in easily-digestible
'sound-bites' which cannot avoid occasional hyperbole. So Mr Patten, best
known for the elegant erudition with which he writes and lectures, has
adapted his linguistic talents to the cause of abusive alliteration.
He still gives the occasional serious speech. One came a few months ago in
the shape of a sermon on 'Politics and the Kingdom of God' delivered from a
Cambridge pulpit. He has not, it seems, changed his basic political outlook.
Labour's 'hat-trick of horrors' was replaced by a considered defence of the
'socially responsible market economy'. His conclusion explained why some
around the cabinet table still describe him as a 'bit of a leftie'. The
market could not be an end in itself. It was not certain to produce
'socially favourable consequences'. It had to be constrained. A sense of
community was necessary to inject fairness into economic relationships.
There were concepts not easily 'priced'.
Such sentiments should be reflected in the Tory manifesto. Mr Patten has a
central role in drafting Mr Major's alternative to the conviction politics
of his predecessor. The final product will sit much more easily alongside
The Tory Case than any of the manifestos he wrote for Mrs Thatcher.
Back at the morning press conferences, the occasional wry smile reinforces
the suspicion that Mr Patten does indeed prefer the pulpit to the central
office platform, political philosophy to propaganda. 'He may be behaving
like Norman Tebbit but he hasn't become him,' offers a friend.
For now, though, he has chosen to worship at the temple of Essex Man. It
causes some of his friends discomfort. One observes sadly that it is rather
as if the Pope (of whose church Mr Patten remains a devout member) were
caught pulling the wings from a fly.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Main parties steady at 40% - Public
opinion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEK'S public opinion polls have done little to change the overall
standing of the two main parties, which have been running roughly neck and
neck since the autumn.
In spite of the frenetic public relations skirmishing of recent weeks, both
the Conservatives and Labour remain locked together with just under 40 per
cent of the vote.
Neither party seems able to break this barrier and consolidate a position
where they can entertain realistic hopes of winning an overall majority of
seats.
Indeed, the FT's weighted average of the last nine opinion polls shows them
rocking back slightly from last week, as the Liberal Democrats apparently
continue to benefit from Mr Paddy Ashdown's admission that he had an affair
with his former secretary.
The Tories will now be setting more store than ever by the opportunity for
setting the agenda afforded by a tax-cutting Budget. Mr Neil Kinnock, the
Labour leader, must be hoping that the grim state of the economy sways more
support his way.
On their present performance, the FT's computer gives the Conservatives 312
seats (against 326 needed for an overall majority), Labour 296 and the
Liberal Democrats 18. In the current parliament, the Conservatives have 367
seats, Labour 230 and the Liberal Democrats 22.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Use of controversial fuel forecast to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURNING of orimulsion, the bitumen-based fuel described by Mr Frank Dobson,
shadow energy secretary, as 'front-runner for the title of filthiest fuel in
the world', could increase twentyfold by 1995.
The forecast of 10m tonnes being burned each year compared with the 500,000
tonnes now burned provoked fierce criticism from environmental groups.
Responding to the announcement by BP Bitor, sole supplier of the fuel in
Europe, Mr Simon Roberts, energy campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said:
'Orimulsion is filth from start to finish.'
BP Bitor yesterday defended the fuel, which became notorious last August
after an accident at Richborough power station, Kent, left cars corroded by
'acid smuts', a kind of acid rain.
Dr Manuel De Oliveira, BP Bitor's chief executive, dismissed claims that the
fuel was dirty as 'absurdly untrue'.
He said Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution had proved that the accident
at Richborough could equally well have happened with oil or coal.
He said orimulsion would not make power stations dirtier as they would still
have to meet European emission targets. The fuel contained more sulphur than
most coal or oil, but emitted little dust and heavy metal and was less
likely to cause acid smuts than other fuels.
BP Bitor has contracts to supply 5.5m tonnes of orimulsion, including 1.5m
tonnes for the electricity generator PowerGen, which burns the fuel at
Richborough and at Ince in Cheshire. Another 4m tonnes will go to National
Power if the generator wins consent to burn orimulsion at its Pembroke
station in Dyfed, Wales.
BP Bitor expected sales to reach 7m to 10m tonnes by the end of the century.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Baker pledges police reforms - Law
and order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Tories would enter the election committed to more effective local
policing through re-organisation within police forces, Mr Kenneth Baker, the
home secretary, promised yesterday as the Tories sought to broaden the
canvas of issues on which they claim Labour cannot be trusted.
Mr Baker said that the manifesto would include a move to 'sector policing'
in which smaller command units are under the control of a local chiefs of
police who would stay in the post for longer than at present.
He said the change, which has been pioneered in Surrey, would be 'as major a
change as my education reforms and the health reforms are'.
'We are concerned with the effectiveness of the police,' he said,
emphasising the Citizen's Charter proposals for forces to publish
performance standards in areas such as response times to emergency calls,
and a greater role for lay people in the police inspectorate.
Law and order has come to the fore as an election issue over the past few
days, with Labour re-launching its policies last Friday and renewing its
attack on the Tories over the record crime figures at a press conference
today.
'The Labour party remains soft-headed and flabby on an issue which requires
toughness and no compromise,' Mr Baker insisted.
Mr Roy Hattersley, shadow home secretary, said Mr Baker wanted to talk about
'imagined shortcomings of the Labour party because he is terrified of
discussing the 13-year record of failure, the doubling of recorded crime
from 2.5m to over 5m'.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour attacks Tory hopes for tax
reductions - Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday sought to keep the political spotlight on the Tories' hopes
for tax cuts in the Budget by reaffirming its determination that any extra
borrowing should be for investment.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said a Labour
government would split Britain's national accounts into current and capital
components. This would make clear how borrowings were being used.
Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, reinforced the conviction of most MPs that
April 9 has been set as the general election date. He said on BBC
television: 'There is a great deal of electioneering going on and I expect
the country wants to bring it to a head.'
Although Mrs Beckett did not say how borrowing would increase or fall under
Labour, she said that to allow the public sector borrowing requirement as a
share of gross domestic product to rise as high as 5 per cent 'would be very
much pushing our luck'.
She condemned as 'extra-ordinarily irresponsible' suggestions by some Tories
that it would be prudent to increase the PSBR to pay for tax cuts in the
March 10 Budget. Such a move would be 'political chicanery of a high order'.
Her comments underlined Labour determination at least to match the Tories'
claims to financial caution and to respect rules on financial deficits -
agreed at the European Community summit in Maastricht - while accepting that
higher borrowing is inevitable in a recession.
Meanwhile, following attacks over the weekend by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour
leader, Downing Street redefined a claim by Mr John Major last week that the
British economy had grown faster than that of any other European country
between 1981 and 1991.
A senior official said that, according to OECD figures, the UK's growth rate
had been higher than that of other 'major' EC countries, except Spain, from
1980 to 1990.
However, smaller EC countries with a higher growth rate over the same period
were Portugal, Ireland and Luxembourg.
Mrs Beckett warned that Tories may be 'massaging expectations' about the
Budget so that a PSBR forecast of below Pounds 30bn would be regarded as
cautious.
Under Labour's plans for the national accounts it would be clear whether
increases in PSBR were used for capital expenditure. Excess spending over
revenue on the current account would be corrected over the economic cycle.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, launched a further attack at a
Westminster press conference on the government's unemployment record. A
Labour adaption of the 1979 Conservative jobless queue poster 'Labour isn't
working' read 'Majorism isn't working'.
Mr Blair said comparative figures showed that the south-east of England had
the fastest rising unemployment of any region of Europe and that the UK had
suffered 'far and away the sharpest fall' in employment of any EC country.
A Labour study, based on job losses reported in newspapers, suggested that
UK job losses have exceeded 56,000 since the beginning of the year.

ENERGY: The 12 regional electricity companies will be expected to meet their
obligation to buy the most economic fuel available in future purchases, be
it coal, gas or something else, Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, assured
MPs yesterday.
His remarks - in response to a question from Mr Geoffrey Lofthouse, the
Labour MP for Pontefract and Castleford - followed last week's comments on
the competitiveness of many new gas-fired power stations by Mr Malcolm
Edwards, British Coal's commercial director, who is expected to leave the
company shortly.
The regional electricity companies had been anxious to back independent
generation projects in order to gain bargaining power with National Power
and PowerGen, the two big generators, Mr Edwards has said.
Meanwhile, the government appointed management consultants Ernst &amp; Young to
examine the feasibility of moving the Department of Energy's Petroleum and
Engineering Directorate to Aberdeen.
*****
PUBLIC INFORMATION: Mr John Major is to make a commitment to greater
openness in Whitehall one of the planks of the Citizen's Charter proposals
in the Tory manifesto.
Downing Street said yesterday that Mr Major was particularly interested in
seeing how information which could help the public judge whether they were
getting a better service could be made more available. He was not, however,
attracted to a freedom of information act, which he believed, could have
'perverse effects'.
The prime minister is said to be ready to look at the application of the
'30-year rule' governing official papers.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Commons renews terrorism measure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN incoming Labour government would seek an all-party consensus on new
anti-terrorist legislation, Mr Roy Hattersley, shadow home secretary, told
the Commons last night, Ivor Owen writes.
Before the Commons voted on renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism
(Temporary Provisions) Act Mr Kenneth Baker, dubbed 'the cheapest home
secretary of this century' by Mr Hattersley, confirmed that the Conservative
party would seek to make Labour's 'softness' on terrorism a central election
issue.
The home secretary suggested that Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, should
overrule Mr Hattersley on whose initiative the opposition had embarked on
the 'irresponsible' course of voting against extending the terrorism act.
Mr Baker emphasised that it was the last Labour government that introduced
the act, under which suspects can be detained for up to seven days for
questioning, or deported from mainland Britain.
Mr Hattersley said a Labour government would establish a judicial tribunal
to determine whether the period a suspect could be detained should be
extended from 48 hours to seven days.
Labour would also retain the provisions under which the IRA and other
terrorist groups could be proscribed, Mr Hattersley said.
Renewal of the act for a further period was approved by a government
majority of 185 (300-115).

FT  25 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Clark confirms he will step down -
Defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN CLARK, the colourful and controversial defence procurement minister,
yesterday announced that he will leave the Commons at the coming general
election.
His decision, after 18 years as a Tory MP, was revealed to his Plymouth
Sutton constituency association at the weekend. Mr Clark commented
yesterday: 'It was a difficult decision to make. And there were a whole
range of different considerations.'
When told that his agent had said he was leaving for personal reasons, Mr
Clark reacted with characteristic abruptness: 'I never said that. 'Personal
reasons' usually means there has been a scandal and I can assure you there
is nothing of that.'
At Westminster, most Conservative colleagues concluded that the wealthy
63-year-old minister has decided to retire to pursue his other interests,
including his work as a historian.
Political opponents claim, however, that his 4,013 majority over the Liberal
Democrats in Sutton has made the seat substantially less secure. At council
elections in May last year, there was criticism among local Tories of his
attention to the constituency and complaints that he had inadequately
defended the Devonport dockyard.
The Old Etonian son of Lord (Kenneth) Clark, the art historian, has long
proved one of the most outspoken, entertaining and quirky figures on the
Tory benches.
This year alone his aristocratic manner has been demonstrated in a court
appearance on speeding charges and contradicted by a magisterial attack on
bloodsports in the pages of The Guardian.
Since moving to his present post from the Department of Trade and Industry
in 1989, he has never been far from controversy. His cavalier manner has
sometimes outraged senior military commanders and his relations with Mr Tom
King, the defence secretary, are said to have been difficult.
His closeness to Mrs Margaret Thatcher strengthened his initial role at the
defence ministry, where his proposals for armed forces cuts set the tone for
the Options for Change review begun in 1990 - although the final reductions
were less drastic than Mr Clark's would have been.
In the midst of the military build-up in the Gulf, he again embarrassed
colleagues by challenging the usefulness of Nato and of keeping US forces in
Europe. On another occasion he accused European allies of 'running to the
cellars' while the US and Britain faced up to Iraq.
As MP for Plymouth Sutton, he appeared to pre-empt decisions on the future
of naval bases with reassurances on prospects for Plymouth's Devonport
facilities.
He was pursued by controversy over his role at the DTI in promoting British
exports to Iraq, although he denied 'giving a nod and wink' to exporters to
evade restrictions on arms sales.
A new Conservative candidate for the seat is expected to be selected within
three weeks.

THE GOVERNMENT yesterday began a series of briefings for Northern Ireland's
political leaders intended to fill the vacuum in the province's politics
until formal 'round-table' negotiations can start.
Mr Brian Mawhinney, Northern Ireland minister, opened the discussions in
Belfast on economic and social issues. The talks were promised last month
when the Northern Ireland Office wound up attempts to start political
negotiations until after the British general election.
Subsequently Mr John Major, the prime minister, reopened the political
initiative, calling on Unionists and nationalists to find ways of overcoming
obstacles to formal talks.
Mr Major will meet Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, in London
tomorrow.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Birmingham joins talks on grants for council estates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of the Environment has started negotiations with Birmingham
City Council over a Pounds 100m grant to improve accommodation and living
standards on the troubled Castle Vale council estate. The estate has the
largest concentration of high-rise blocks in the city.
The grant would be made through a Housing Action Trust (HAT), a government
method of taking control of a rundown estate away from a local authority,
with the approval of the tenants, at least while it is being renovated.
Negotiations are also taking place with the councils of Liverpool and the
London boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Brent to set up HATs. These talks
provide evidence of the changing political atmosphere between the
Conservative government and Labour local authorities.
Some Labour councils are also applying for City Challenge funds for urban
regeneration, showing a greater readiness to work with the government.
During the Thatcher years, the government's attempts from 1988 onwards to
organise HATs in the London boroughs of Lambeth, Southwark and Tower
Hamlets, and in Leeds, Sandwell in West Midlands, and Sunderland all
foundered.
Councillor Stan Austin, chairman of Birmingham's housing committee, said his
authority became interested in HATs when the government changed the rules
for their application. Instead of remaining permanently outside local
authority control, tenants on an estate where there is a HAT may now select,
by ballot, their new landlord after a HAT has completed its work.
Mr Austin said: 'The DoE is prepared to talk in terms of Pounds 100m over
five years. You can do a lot with that kind of money.' Other means of
raising money for housing improvements, such as the government's Estate
Action programme, would mean council borrowing.
Under existing policy the government reserves HAT funds for council estates
where expenditure on housing improvement is outside the capacity of the
local authority. Two have been agreed in the past year: one in north Hull,
where spending will be Pounds 50m over up to seven years and another in
Waltham Forest, north-east London, where spending will be Pounds 170m over
eight years.
About 11,000 people live in Castle Vale in north-east Birmingham. The estate
was built in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Much of the construction is
poured concrete, which has caused damp and cold. The underfloor heating
system could lead to bills of Pounds 500 a quarter, said Mr Austin.

FT  25 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): BT under pressure on childcare
provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY three fifths of mothers and 13 per cent of fathers working for BT,
the telecommunications company, do not apply for promotion because of the
demands of childcare, according to a union survey.
BT Union, the co-ordinating body for the four unions which negotiate with
BT, said the results demonstrated the need for BT to assist staff with
childcare costs. It called on the company to act in line with commitments
made in October at the launch of Opportunity 2000, the business-backed
initiative to improve the situation of women at work.
Mr Tony Young, general-secretary of the NCU communications union, said the
survey sought 'to bring these facts out into the open and put pressure on BT
to do more than just say they are an equal opportunities employer'.
BT - which employs 220,000 staff, 28 per cent of whom are women - welcomed
the survey as a contribution to the debate on attracting, retaining and
developing women in the workforce. It said direct payments to staff with
children would be unfair. Provision would be expensive and unlikely to suit
all cases.
Ms Beverley McGowan, assistant secretary of STE, the managers' union, said
the survey showed men were taking childcare seriously. 'We found that aspect
of the results both surprising and heartening,' she said.
The survey found 61 per cent of fathers and 80 per cent of mothers would use
a workplace nursery and 65 per cent of fathers and 87 per cent of mothers a
holiday playscheme. BT Union set the weekly cost of childcare at Pounds 50
per child and said it did not expect BT to bear the full costs.
More than 2,500 staff responded to the survey.

FT  25 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): HMSO services face disruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERVICES PROVIDED by Her Majesty's Stationery Office face disruption after
three out of four unions representing non-industrial workers voted for
industrial action over pay.
Members of the NUCPS and CPSA Civil Service unions and the GMPU print union
voted for industrial action short of a strike over an offer which the unions
say is worth 3.5 per cent in a year.
Members are to be instructed by their leaders to refuse overtime work and to
work to rule.
The three unions are also considering a series of selective strikes by key
groups of workers. One possibility is that they will call for strike votes
among workers at Hansard, which publishes parliamentary debates.
Apart from printing services, HMSO provides stationery and furniture for
some government departments.
The dispute is significant because HMSO is the first, and so far only,
government agency to introduce a pay system outside national bargaining
structures in the Civil Service.
The government wants other agencies, and possibly entire Civil Service
departments, to follow the HMSO example.
Mr Graeme Watt, NUCPS national officer, said that even without strikes, the
overtime ban and work to rule would slow the work of HMSO, causing delays
for the public and government departments.
Members of the IPMS Civil Service union voted to accept the offer which
would mean deferring a pay rise for three months from last October, when the
settlement was due, and receiving a 4.7 per cent increase for the rest of
the pay year.
Its leaders will nonetheless press for an increase, on the grounds that the
184 to 163 vote to accept the deal showed that there was considerable
hostility to it.
In other ballots the NUCPS produced a 198 to 173 vote for action and the
CPSA voted by 250 to 94 for action.
The 4.7 per cent offer compares with increases of at least 6.5 per cent won
last year by civil servants covered by national pay bargaining arrangements.
HMSO pointed out that most of the 2,000 non-industrial civil servants would
win performance-pay rises of 5 per cent from April, in addition to the 4.7
per cent rise. It said anything above 4.7 per cent would have jeopardised
its ability to meet last year's profit target of Pounds 4m, set in
discussions with the Treasury.
HMSO has refused the unions' request for arbitration. Mr Eddie Spence, CPSA
national officer, said the options were a fight or a fair deal.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Second rejection for ITV proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Independent Television Commission has rejected ITV's proposals for a new
national network for the second time.
The members of the commission, who were expected to approve the new
networking arrangements, decided to seek more detailed information from the
ITV companies.
The decision means further delay to a network system, led by a central
scheduler or director, which is supposed to be in place by January when the
new 10-year franchises start.
The 1990 Broadcasting Act required the creation of a fairer ITV network with
proper access for independent production companies and the smaller ITV
companies. In the past the large ITV companies have been accused of dividing
up the network for their own programmes.
The arrangements have to be approved by the ITC and then examined by the
Office of Fair Trading to ensure that they are open and fair.
The ITC rejection of the revised proposals does not seem to involve central
points of principle. All the signs are that the ITV companies have conceded
that independent producers should have a direct right of access to the
central scheduler. The programmes would, however, be made through a
sponsoring ITV company as the legal broadcaster.
The ITC members want to see the details of the terms of trade and contracts
that would govern relations between ITV companies and independent producers.
It is not clear whether ITV has worked out its networking proposals in that
detail yet.
Mr Charles Denton, president of Pact, the independent producers group, has
been demanding a fair, competitive and open market in programme production.

FT  25 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Teachers signal support for Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEACHERS INTEND to vote overwhelmingly against the Conservatives in the
coming general election, according to a Gallup poll published yesterday.
The poll, of 507 state-sector teachers in England and Wales conducted
earlier this month, shows 48 per cent proposing to vote Labour, 22 per cent
Liberal Democrat and 17 per cent Conservative while 10 per cent did not
know.
Conservative support slumped to 13 per cent in the north of England but even
in the south the Tories trailed the Liberal Democrats by four percentage
points at 21 per cent.
The poll, commissioned by the NASUWT teachers' union, was conducted shortly
before the government announced a generous 7.5 per cent teachers pay
increase for next year. Most teachers (87 per cent) support the decision to
establish a review body. It is unclear whether its findings have helped
endear the government to teachers.
Voting intentions were broadly similar among primary and secondary teachers.
The Conservatives were third-placed even among head teachers.
The government slipped further still on the question 'Which party has the
best education policies?'. Responses were: Labour 43 per cent, Liberal
Democrat 12 per cent, Conservative 8 per cent, none 23 per cent, don't know
13 per cent.
The poll reflects a steady decline in teacher support for the Conservatives
since 1979, if it is compared with surveys commissioned by the Times
Educational Supplement immediately before the last three elections.
Of secondary teachers, the proportions intending to vote Tory in the earlier
surveys were 45 per cent in 1979, 39 per cent in 1983 and 24 per cent in
1987.
The poll also showed firm support for teacher unions. In all, 84 per cent of
teachers said unions still had an effective role to play.

FT  25 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Health union votes for Nalgo merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGES IN the National Health Service's management style have prompted a
4,500-strong health workers' union to end more than 70 years of independence
and join the Nalgo public service union.
The Association of National Health Service Officers said the decision had
been made partly because of pressure from managers to break up national
bargaining in the NHS. This meant more union negotiators were needed.
Mr Roy Paterson, the association's general secretary, said another factor
was that changes in NHS management style had increased the number of members
facing disciplinary problems and needing union representation.
In addition, lay officials were finding it increasingly difficult to obtain
management permission for time off work.
Mr Paterson said the union had only three full-time staff, and members
needed the greater resources that joining Nalgo would provide.
The association's decision, approved by 79 per cent of voters in a
membership ballot, highlights the trend to a smaller number of larger
unions.
Many observers believe there will be four or five super-unions by the end of
the century and these will increasingly act as a home for smaller
organisations which would otherwise struggle to survive.
The association's vote comes after a year in which Nalgo has already
increased its membership by 15,000 to 760,000, against a trend of membership
decline in other unions. It provides a fillip for Nalgo leadership as it
prepares for a meeting of activists next week to discuss its plan to create
Britain's largest union - with 1.4m members  - by merging with the Nupe and
Cohse public service unions.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, Nalgo general secretary, said yesterday he was confident
a special conference of more than 1,500 union members next week would reject
attempts by some branches to stop the merger.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Banks' veto dooms planned share register venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROPOSED joint venture between UK banks to handle some aspects of share
registration appeared to have collapsed last night as two leading clearers
rejected the idea.
A bank that promoted the idea, National Westminster, claims it would lead to
lower costs for listed companies and make share ownership simpler for
private individuals.
The proposal, for a central bureau in the City to hold details of private
investors' shareholdings, would involve company registrars pooling their
existing services. To work, it needs the support of at least the three
biggest registrars.
However, yesterday both Lloyds and Barclays, which together control about 50
per cent of the registration market, rejected the idea.
In a statement, Lloyds said it had written to the Stock Exchange, which has
formally floated the idea, declining to take it further. The exchange had
been seeking support for a Pounds 250,000 feasibility study, to be
undertaken by the Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte management consultancy.
Lloyds rejected the idea vigorously, saying it had 'serious reservations'
about the proposals. The bank - the largest of the UK's registrars - said it
already had advanced computer systems and did not need to involve itself in
a joint venture. It also disputed claims that a central bureau would improve
the service or reduce costs for investors and listed companies. 'We believe
joint ventures are inherently inefficient and anti-competitive,' it said.
Barclays also cast doubt on the desirability of a joint venture, given
unsuccessful attempts at such arrangements in the City in the past. It said
that the idea, though it had attractions, had come too late in the
development of Taurus, the exchange's planned paperless settlement system.
Mr John Lamb, the NatWest assistant general manager who had promoted the
idea, said: 'Obviously it is disappointing if the two banks appear not to be
keen on investigating the idea.' He added that the exchange and ProShare,
the new association to promote wider share ownership, supported the idea,
but accepted that without the support of Barclays and Lloyds it had little
chance of success.
If developed, a bureau would hold most shareholder details centrally,
leading to greater economies of scale and hence lower fees for companies,
according to the scheme's supporters. Private investors would also be able
to receive a single, consolidated statement of all their shareholdings.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Chamber reports a fall in exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING exports from Merseyside, Cheshire and north Wales slipped back
during the winter after a surge in the autumn, according to the latest
economic and manpower survey by Liverpool Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Continuing good exports by 102 service companies masked weak and variable
performances among the 105 manufacturers in the survey. This kept the
exports balance figure - the difference between those reporting increases
and declines - positive at 13 percentage points. The autumn balance was 23
points.
The decline in domestic sales continued, with a balance of minus 7 points.
This compares with minus 10 in the autumn and minus 31 six months ago,
prompting the chamber to say that the rate of decline may have slowed.
Orders from the UK showed a balance of minus 4 points, supporting this view.
The survey showed companies with more than 500 employees suffering most.
Only 10 per cent of these increased sales at home.
Workforce reductions continued. However, although the balance figure from
quarter to quarter was unchanged at minus 9 points, 53 per cent kept numbers
stable compared with 49 per cent in the autumn. The balance in the summer
was minus 18 points, with 43 per cent stable.
Confidence indicators remained high. Only 10 per cent expected turnover to
fall this year and only 18 per cent forecast lower profits.
There was some weakening of optimism - a drop of 8 points to 54 per cent
expecting increased turnover, but a fall of only 3 points to 47 per cent who
forecast profit improvement.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Large pension fund pools show disappointing results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE PENSION fund pools performed particularly badly last year, according
to Caps, the pension fund performance measurement service.
Three of the four largest fund managers - Scottish Widows, Scottish Amicable
and Provident Mutual - were below the lower-quartile average of 14.5 per
cent. Returns on their discretionary pension funds, representing pools of
small pension funds totalling up to Pounds 1bn, were 13.8 per cent, 11.6 per
cent and 13.9 per cent respectively.
The worst performer was Provident Life, yielding 8.8 per cent. Provident
Capitol and Scottish Amicable were second and third from the bottom.
In the five years to December National Provident, Guardian Royal Exchange
and Scottish Provident turned in the poorest performances. They had returns
of 7.1 per cent, 7 per cent and 5.8 per cent respectively.
The top performer last year was Lloyds Investment Managers, which earned a
20.5 per cent return on assets. Baillie Gifford and Eagle Star were second
and third, with returns of 20.3 per cent and 19.9 per cent respectively.
Over five years, the top performers were Britannia Life, Lloyds Investment
Managers and National Mutual Life.
The funds in each pool include property, fixed income and overseas
investments. The survey does not identify clients it just names the fund
manager. Pools typically contain funds of small pension funds with no more
than Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m in assets. The survey covers 80 separate
investment institutions managing total assets of more than Pounds 20bn.
According to Caps the average pooled pension fund returned 17.4 per cent -
well above the 7.5 per cent rise in average earnings and the 4.5 per cent
rise in retail prices.
The best-performing sectors last year were the North American market, which
returned 34.1 per cent, and the Pacific Basin excluding Japan with 30.1 per
cent.

BRITISH Midland Airways, the UK's second-biggest scheduled airline, has
carried out its threat to cut domestic services in favour of international
routes.
It is ending flights between London's Heathrow Airport and Liverpool at the
end of March. It will use the freed landing slots at Heathrow to run six
flights a day to Brussels.
British Midland, 25 per cent owned by Scandinavian Airline System,
threatened in December to end the flights as part of its campaign to be

THE GOVERNMENT is to subsidise a home savings scheme for armed forces
personnel, David White writes.
The scheme, designed to provide benefits similar to the tax relief
homeowners receive on mortgage interest, was announced by Mr Tom King,
defence secretary, in a package of housing and resettlement measures.
Mr King said the measures went 'a long way' to overcoming the disadvantages
faced by personnel because of having to move around.
Service people who are not homeowners and who save between Pounds 50 and
Pounds 200 a month for at least five years will be entitled to an extra
Pounds 1 for every Pounds 3 of savings and interest in order to buy a house
or flat at the end of the period.
Those personnel being made redundant are to be allowed to keep their married
quarters at market rent as long as the premises are not needed.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Clowes audit inquiry reopened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INVESTIGATION into the auditors of Barlow Clowes, the disgraced fund
management company which was closed by the Department of Trade and Industry
in 1988, has been reopened by the accountants' professional body.
The Joint Disciplinary Scheme (JDS) of the institutes of chartered
accountants in England, Wales and Scotland and the Association of Certified
Accountants confirmed yesterday that it had recommenced investigations into
the involvement of Spicer &amp; Pegler and Touche Ross as auditors to the
company.
The two firms, which merged in 1990, could be fined substantial sums and
ordered to pay inquiry costs - believed to total more than Pounds 1m already
 -if the inquiry finds against them.
The move comes after the 112-day Barlow Clowes trial ended earlier this
month. Mr Peter Clowes, the company's founder, was jailed for 10 years for
theft and fraud.
A committee established by the JDS to investigate the case began work in
January 1989 but was suspended in July last year following a request from
the Serious Fraud Office. The SFO is believed to have argued that continuing
the investigations before the trial could have interfered with the course of
justice.
The JDS inquiry was already well-advanced and it is believed that the costs
incurred to date make it the most expensive investigation yet undertaken. No
decision is expected from the committee before next year. The committee
comprises two accountants and a judge, with the assistance of an accountancy
firm.
The JDS examines questions against accountants and accountancy firms only
where allegations are complex and raise matters of substantial public
concern.
Last week it fined Arthur Young, now part of Ernst &amp; Young, Pounds 100,000
and Pounds 40,000 costs for its role as auditor to Milbury, the collapsed
house-building group controlled by Mr Jim Raper.
The only other case it is considering at present is against Arthur Young as
auditor to Alexander Howden and Minet, the insurance companies. Both
companies were criticised in a 1990 DTI report for the diversion of
reinsurance funds.
Most investigations are handled internally by the disciplinary committees of
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the other
professional bodies.
Touche Ross said yesterday: 'We believe it is absolutely inappropriate for
us to comment on matters in this case at the moment.'

FT  25 FEB 92 / Tax advisers urged to take tougher line with clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX ADVISERS should refuse to submit tax returns on behalf of clients who
cannot explain why information has been withheld, and should consider
ceasing to do any work for them, two professional bodies recommended
yesterday.
Advisers are also urged to highlight any items in a client's returns to the
Inland Revenue where they have doubts about the tax treatment.
The advice comes in guidelines published by the Institute of Taxation and
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The guidance
comes after four years of discussion with the Revenue and are based on the
experiences of the institutes' members.
Mr Philip Hardman of Grant Thornton, one of the accountants involved in
drawing up the guidelines, said: 'If you are in any doubt about the tax
treatment you should give the Revenue full information and not mislead them.
The best advice is to give them full information and not to bury an item.'
The guidelines will become particularly appropriate next year when the
Revenue introduces a 'pay and file' corporate tax system similar to that
used in the US. There the onus is on companies to declare all tax for which
they believe they are liable.
The institutes have sought legal counsel suggesting that when this level of
disclosure takes place and the tax returns are approved by the Revenue, the
case cannot be re-opened at a later date. The Revenue argues that it retains
this right in certain instances.
The guidelines say there is no legal obligation to disclose information, but
advisers should use their professional judgment where there is doubt. They
add that normal client confidentiality may be overruled where there is a
public duty to disclose information.

Blvd, Milton Keynes MK9 2HL. Free.
SIX Labour MPs headed by Mr Austin Mitchell, member for Great Grimsby, are
demanding independent regulation of the auditing industry, David Owen
writes. They cite the sector's lack of confidence 'in the light of the
rising tide of financial scandals'.
Their early-day motion deplores 'the fact that where auditors should act to
protect and warn the public and shareholders, too many have been drawn into
a collusive relationship with directors by their desire to sell non-auditing
services to firms'.

<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court agreed yesterday to decide whether accounting firms can
be sued under federal racketeering laws if the firms falsify a client's
financial statements, Bloomberg reports from Washington.
The judges agreed to hear arguments in a case involving a farm co-operative
that filed for bankruptcy in 1984. After entering bankruptcy proceedings,
the co-op's trustee and investors sued Arthur Young &amp; Co, the co-op's
auditor, alleging that the firm misrepresented the financial condition of
the co-op to its board of directors.
The investors sued under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act (Rico), designed to be used against organised crime. The Court of
Appeals dismissed the suit ruling that Arthur Young's preparation of
financial statements did not mean the firm was involved in the co-op's
fraudulent affairs. The Supreme Court is to review the decision.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Kerrey and Harkin pin hopes on South Dakota
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE focus of the US presidential primaries shifts to South Dakota today
where the two midwestern Democrats - Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Tom
Harkin of Iowa - are engaged in a duel which could kill off their campaigns.
After finishing third and fourth respectively in the New Hampshire primary
last Tuesday, each senator must show significant strength in his regional
home base if he is to raise enough money to stay in the race.
The most recent polls have Mr Kerrey leading the field. However, these were
taken before a contentious debate on Sunday night gave many Dakotans their
first in-depth look at the national front-runners, Governor Bill Clinton of
Arkansas and former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts.
Mr Tsongas stumbled on Sunday in the Maine caucuses. What should have been
an easy victory, after his win in New Hampshire, ended in a close race with
former Governor Jerry Brown of California. Mr Brown turned Mr Tsongas's
support for nuclear power into a campaign issue and exposed vulnerability in
the pro-business candidate.
These early races have little to do with collecting supporting delegates for
the party's convention. They are skirmishes, demonstrating a candidate's
electability, and the name of the game is to create sufficient momentum to
carry him into the larger races in the south on March 10, then Michigan,
Illinois and New York.
Mr Harkin, a 'prairie populist' with strong union and farm group support,
ought to win in South Dakota if he can win anywhere. But he was badly
wounded by his poor showing in New Hampshire.
Mr Kerrey, an extraordinarily popular figure in neighbouring Nebraska, a war
hero who calls for a restructuring of government and 'fundamental change' in
US domestic policies, has sought to demonstrate a grasp of rural issues.
With a victory in South Dakota, he could sell himself as an appealing
candidate if the front-runners falter.
But the voters could move towards Mr Clinton, a 'farm state governor' who
turned in a smooth debate performance on Sunday. Mr Tsongas made much of his
wife's South Dakota origins and promised to appoint an agriculture secretary
who 'will be committed to preserving the family farm'.
On the Republican side, the White House has yet to recover its equilibrium
after President George Bush's weak win over right-wing commentator Mr
Patrick Buchanan in New Hampshire. Their biggest return match is slated for
Georgia next Tuesday.
The president's strategists have been torn over how to handle Mr Buchanan,
but are seeking to placate party conservatives. Last week Mr Bush fired the
controversial chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, long a demand
of the Republican right.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Victory still eludes the drugs warriors: The background to
this week's summit in San Antonio on narcotics
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NARCOTICS have replaced communism as the new enemy of the US in Latin
America. But neither President George Bush, nor the heads of state of the
Latin American countries whom he meets at a drugs summit tomorrow in San
Antonio, Texas, can claim much success in the war.
It has been two years since the last such summit, in Cartagena, Colombia. In
addition to the presidents of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia who then met
President Bush, their counterparts in Mexico and Ecuador will attend the
two-day meeting.
There has been the occasional victory since Cartagena when the US stepped up
its promised aid and its military presence in the drug-producing states.
Drug seizures have risen significantly and some of the leading drugs
traffickers, such as the bosses of the Medelln cocaine cartel, are behind
bars.
However, the flow has not been stemmed and, if anything, has increased. The
drugs traffickers have found new export routes, production has shifted from
one place to another, new markets have been found as cocaine consumption has
risen in Europe, and the drugs barons have diversified into other illicit
products such as heroin.
Fighting an election at home, Mr Bush will seek to create an impression that
he is being tough on the drugs problem. However, in some Latin countries,
there is considerable scepticism about the likely outcome of the talks,
which one US official has called a step towards an 'international anti-drugs
cartel'.
The US has been pressing for measures that will improve the ability of the
authorities to crack down on the production, processing and transport of
narcotics. Such measures, allowing, for example, increased cross-border 'hot
pursuit' of traffickers, are being resisted by Andean countries seeing
threats to their own sovereignty.
Mexico is likely to support Andean resistance against an overbearing US
military role in the region. Mr Ignacio Morales Lechuga, Mexico's
attorney-general, said last week that Mexico would not participate in a
multinational anti-drug force. Mexican officials have said they will oppose
any co-operation that infringes their national sovereignty, and will support
other countries that take a similar position.
Nevertheless, the Mexicans will push hard for creation of a regional
intelligence information system, that would help in the capture of drugs.
About half all US cocaine imports pass through Mexico. Mexico also produces
about a third of the heroin and 70 per cent of the marijuana entering the
US.
For their part, against increasing US scepticism, the Andean countries want
more emphasis on alternative development, such as finding crop substitutes
for the coca bush.
A UN official based in Latin America commented: 'We are letting countries
like Bolivia think they can have their cake and eat it. It is getting
Dollars 700m a year in drug- related assistance while cocaine production is
increasing.'
Some drugs experts point out that the incentives for countries such as
Bolivia to end drugs production are slight: if they succeed, aid flows will
cease and the prospects increase for unrest among farmers deprived of a
living and a military deprived of the equipment financed by drugs aid.
According to a report in the Mexican government newspaper El Nacional, some
90 per cent of the US proposals for the summit focus on repressive tools -
such as military co-operation, police surveillance and control of chemicals
used in refining of drugs. Only 10 per cent suggest alternative programmes,
such as crop substitution, economic aid and reducing US demand.
Mr Bernard Aronson, responsible for Latin American affairs at the US State
Department, said last week that alternative development was only realistic
if interdiction were successful and lead to a reduction in demand and a fall
in prices. He also said alternative development could not be applied in an
isolated manner in producing countries.
Coca growers in Peru, which produces 60 per cent of world coca, have
protested that, since signing an accord last May with the US, nothing has
been done to help substitute crops.
No inroads on coca production in Peru have been made. Coca acreage is
increasing: a well-placed source in Lima estimates it is between 240,000 and
280,000 hectares. Official US figures are unreliable because they are
'politically manipulated,' he says. This means the Americans are turning a
blind eye to some 70,000 newly-discovered hectares in the Maranon and
Quillabamba valleys.
Efforts to crack down elsewhere have transformed Bolivia in the last five
years from a humble producer of leaf to the world's second largest cocaine
producer and turned Brazil (which produces only cannabis but smuggles
everything) into a major route to Europe.
The near impossible task of policing such areas is not helped by police
involvement in the narcotics trade. One US Drug Enforcement Agency official
said 'the biggest problem in Brazil is the police.' In Peru, Mr Hernando de
Soto who resigned last month as a drugs adviser to President Alberto
Fujimori, said: 'Drugs are regularly dispatched from places under the
state's control'.
In Colombia, the promise that they would not be extradited secured the
surrender of the leaders of the big Medelln cocaine cartel. But there have
been few signs that this has reduced cocaine traffic. Meanwhile, large areas
of the mountains are cultivating a new menace: poppies yielding heroin,
whose street price in the US is 10 times that of cocaine.
In a gesture apparently aimed at the summit, the Colombian government has
announced it will begin spraying the poppies with the herbicide, glysophate.
Latin American governments have regarded consumption as somebody else's
problem and have said the US must do more to try to curb demand. However
narcotics in Latin America is increasingly becoming an internal problem with
cocaine-derived crack replacing glue sniffing as the latest addiction among
children in poor areas across the continent.

FT  25 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Call for end to German software 'piracy'
</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US computer software publishers have petitioned Mrs Carla Hills, US trade
representative, to take action to curtail 'pervasive piracy' of software
programs in Germany, Louise Kehoe reports from San Francisco. According to a
US software industry group, illegal copying of software programs in Germany
cost the world-wide software industry nearly Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.08bn)
in 1990.
'Stopping piracy in Germany is the highest trade priority for the US
software industry, and we call on the US government to help our cause by
obtaining a commitment from the German government to solve this problem,'
said Mr Robert Holleyman, managing director of the Business Software
Alliance (BSA), a trade group whose members include the largest US software
companies.
The industry asked Mrs Hills to place Germany on a 'priority watch list'
under Section 301 of US trade law, which requires the government to take
action to resolve the complaint and provides for imposition of trade
sanctions.
Piracy in Germany cost the US software industry an estimated Dollars 721m in
1990, the industry group said. The German government has failed to enforce
copyright laws against individuals and companies that use copied software,
it claims.
Industry executives say the problem stems from rampant software copying in
the former East Germany. Rapid growth of market demand in Germany since
unification is being met by illegal software that is fast achieving a deeper
market penetration than legitimate products, the US group contends.
'Illegal practices of this scale are inexcusable in a country such as
Germany where the economy and business culture are among the most advanced
in the world,' Mr Holleyman said. 'We call on the German government to
implement the EC's directive for the legal protection of software. . .
Further, we call on the US government to address this problem with Germany
as one of our nation's top trade priorities in 1992.'
The group also cites Italy, Taiwan, Thailand, Poland and South Korea as
countries that have failed to implement protection of software copyrights.

<TEXT>
THE US International Trade Commission has issued an exclusion order banning
import of semiconductor devices made outside the country by five American
companies whose products were found to infringe a patent held by Texas
Instruments (TI), Louise Kehoe reports from San Francisco.
The exclusion order now goes to President Bush for review and signing. It
would prevent the companies importing and selling any integrated circuit or
circuit board product that uses TI's patented technology. But the ITC order
is not expected to have any material effect on the five companies.
They are Analog Devices, Cypress Semiconductor, Integrated Device
Technology, LSI Logic and VLSI Technology. The companies say they no longer
use the technology in TI's complaint. The impact of the exclusion order is
significantly diminished by an earlier ITC ruling narrowing TI's patent
claims, enabling the companies to circumvent TI's patents.
The technology in question is the process whereby electronic chips are
encapsulated in plastic packages. TI holds patents on the most commonly used
method called 'bottom gating' where plastic is injected into a mould cavity
underneath the chip. But since the TI complaint was filed 18 months ago, all
five have converted to an alternative approach which the ITC ruled is not
covered by TI's patent.

CRUCIAL talks on the proposed North American free trade agreement (Nafta) in
Dallas last week have done little to resolve uncertainty clouding the
treaty, as negotiators refused to say where, if any, significant
breakthroughs were made, Damian Fraser reports from Mexico City.
Presidents Carlos Salinas de Gortari and George Bush will meet in San
Antonio this week, where they will discuss progress over the talks and
perhaps give their negotiators authority to make key concessions.
The Mexican government, according to various Mexican press reports, is still
being pressured to make further concessions in agriculture, energy,

textiles, cars, a disputes mechanism and anti-dumping rules.
The US trade representative's office said negotiators would report to their

McDONNELL DOUGLAS of the US and British Aerospace have agreed to develop and
produce a new strike fighter-aircraft, Daniel Green reports.
It will be capable of short take-off and vertical landing like the Harrier
jet which is also produced under an agreement between the two companies. The
new project is independent from the Harrier.
McDonnell Douglas said yesterday technical demonstrations should be made by
1999 and it should be operational between 2005 and 2010. The initial
programme would be to define the aircraft's capabilities and what missions
it would be asked to undertake. This could lead to manufacture of a
demonstration aircraft, in turn used to test new propulsion and
manufacturing techniques.
The deal depends on approval from the US government. It needs to give the
go-ahead to the required transfer of technology. McDonnell Douglas makes the
Harrier under licence from British Aerospace, but has improved its
performance and specification for US military use.

THE US has set June as the deadline for resolving issues over North Korean
nuclear weapons development and forcing the isolated communist nation to
open to inspections, officials said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Seoul.
It is the first time a specific deadline has been mentioned. It comes amid
growing concerns that North Korea is purposely stalling inspections of its
nuclear facilities to gain crucial time for arms development or to move
facilities.
Mr Douglas Paal, a US national security adviser, met South Korean officials
in Seoul yesterday . He was said to have expressed dissatisfaction on the
lack of progress in nuclear talks between North and South Korea and urged
the Seoul government to exercise caution in inter-Korean relations until
nuclear worries were resolved.
North Korea is due to attend United Nations-backed talks in Seoul this week
on building a big industrial complex near the North's border with Russia and
China.
It will be the first North Korean government delegation to visit South Korea
for an international meeting. In the past, North Koreans travelled to the
south only for inter-Korea talks.
The two-day meeting called by the United Nations Development Programme
starts on Thursday. It will focus on development of the Tuman River area.
South and North Korea, China and Mongolia have been invited to participate.
Russia and Japan will be present as observers.
The UNDP proposed last year that the 10,000 sq km delta should be developed
as a industrial zone with tax incentives offered to foreign investments.
A management committee was formed to work out final development plans by
July 1993. Officials estimate that some Dollars 30bn will be put into the
project over 20 years.

<TEXT>
THE Hong Kong government is planning to boost its spending by 16 per cent in
nominal terms in the 1992-93 fiscal year which starts on April 1.
Mr K. Y. Yeung, secretary for the treasury, said the spending plans of the
government were based on an inflation assumption for the year of about 11
per cent and real economic growth of around 5 per cent.
Mr Hamish MacLeod, the colony's financial secretary, will present his first
budget on March 4, when he will detail the government's tax plans and its
view of the colony's economic prospects in the year ahead.
The spending plans show a more than doubling in capital works and investment
to HKDollars 11.1bn (Pounds 806m) from HKDollars 4.8bn.
A large part of the increase represents expenditures for the colony's new
airport and development of its ports.
Current spending in the colony, 70 per cent of which is absorbed by the
wages and salaries of employees in government service, is set to rise by
15.3 per cent to HKDollars 84.6bn (Pounds 6.15bn) from an estimated outturn
for 1991-92 of HKDollars 73.8bn.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S department and chain stores reported modest sales growth of 1.6 per
cent and 2 per cent respectively in January, compared with the same month
last year, suggesting that consumer demand remains relatively strong in
spite of the general slowing of economic growth.
The Japan Department Stores' Association said that sales growth was curbed
by a continuing fall in demand for items such as paintings and precious
metals, sales of which surged during the expansion of the so-called economic
'bubble' in the late 1980s.
Total sales remained above last year's level even though workers' end-year
bonuses fell, while overtime in December was 16.1 per cent lower than a year
earlier, reflecting a reduction in production output in a range of
industries, including the electronics and car sectors.
Department stores' sales of personal articles rose 5 per cent, while
foodstuff sales were 4.3 per cent higher and clothing 1.5 per cent higher.
But sales of household articles were flat and those of sundry goods fell by
4 per cent. The association attributed slow clothing sales to the warm
winter.

FT  25 FEB 92 / First ladies address the plight of rural female poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 70 women drawn from royalty and the ranks of presidential or prime
ministerial consorts have descended on Geneva for a two-day summit intended
to ensure a better deal for the world's 565m rural female poor.
The aim is to persuade governments at the highest level to reorientate
development programmes in favour of women, to reflect their important role
in food production. Women produce more than half of all food grown in
developing countries, and an estimated 70 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa.
'If we could increase the productivity of rural women by 15 per cent, we
could wipe out the food deficit in Africa,' says Mr Idriss Jazairy,
president of the United Nations International Fund for Agricultural
Development (Ifad), which is organising the summit.
'Unless we can promote the role of women, the goal of eliminating hunger
cannot be achieved.' Increased food production and higher rural incomes
contribute in their turn to national growth.
Mr Jazairy sees the summit, which has been initiated by six Third World
'first ladies' under the patronage of Queen Fabiola of Belgium, as providing
a much-needed jolt to international awareness.
Mr Jazairy, a former Algerian diplomat, says Ifad projects have already
demonstrated the 'bankability' of aiding women in agricultural development.
But with projects worth Dollars 375m (Pounds 123m) a year scattered around
the world, the small Rome-based agency has little financial leverage to
persuade governments to change the emphasis of national development
programmes. However, by definition, 'first ladies' have influence at the
highest levels.
According to Ifad, women account for nearly 60 per cent of the Third World's
rural poor, and their numbers have jumped by half in the past 20 years.
In developing countries as a whole (excluding India and China) one in five
households has a female head, yet women are consistently denied access to
land, agricultural inputs and credit.
Population growth, environmental degradation and socio-economic pressures
will force increasing numbers of women into poverty in the coming years,
Ifad predicts, and the total could reach 700m by the end of the decade. To
stop things getting worse would cost as little as Dollars 750m a year, the
agency says.
This message should appeal to hard-headed donor countries. But few 'first
ladies' from the first world have come to Geneva. Mrs Norma Major is
represented by a low-ranking official in the UK's Geneva diplomatic mission.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Indian president warns parliament on high inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN President R. Venkataraman yesterday opened parliament with a warning
of the dangers of high levels of inflation in the country.
His speech to the two houses was seen as setting the scene for a budget in
which the main emphasis will be on cutting government expenditure as a way
of reducing the fiscal deficit and inflation. The government is keen to
avoid adding substantially to the tax burden for fear this will further
exacerbate pressure on prices.
Describing inflation as 'a matter of grave concern,' Mr Venkataraman said
that 'once the fiscal deficit is reduced and brought under control,
inflation can be expected to come down to reasonable levels'.
The budget, due to be delivered on Saturday by Dr Manmohan Singh, finance
minister, will mark the second wave of the government's liberalisation and
economic restructuring programme launched by the new Congress party
government in July. It will show how radical the government is prepared to
be over reducing protective tariffs, cutting government expenditure and in
tackling overmanning in the public sector.
But room for manoeuvre has been reduced by continuing high inflation and the
industrial production slump, raising fears that reform could become ensnared
in Latin American-style stagflation.
Inflation has dropped to 12 per cent from a 16 per cent annualised rate in
August - but remains well above the 9 per cent for financial 1991-1992 that
the finance minister had forecast. Industrial production has also tumbled
more sharply than expected, with zero or negative growth now forecast this
year, against an 8 per cent rise last year.
Dr Deepak Nayyar, former chief economic adviser who resigned after policy
disagreements with the finance minister, warned at the weekend of the risks
of stagflation from unsustainably high levels of inflation and of the
deficit on the external account. He called for a slowdown in structural
reforms until greater macroeconomic balance had been achieved.
The government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, nonetheless faces
the budget session in a politically stronger position than six months ago.
The 12 seats Congress won in last week's elections in Punjab give it close
to a majority in the parliament.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA'S current account deficit hit a record Dollars 8.83bn last year,
provisional Bank of Korea figures showed yesterday, and economists said the
shortfall would worsen this year, Reuter reports from Seoul.
The 1991 deficit outstripped the previous record of Dollars 5.32bn set in
1980 and compared with a 1990 deficit of Dollars 2.18bn, the central bank
said.
Economists predicted that the shortfall in the current account, which
measures trade and international transactions in invisible goods and
services, would widen to between Dollars 9bn and Dollars 10bn this year.
Mr Park Jeong-ryong, central bank economist said: 'The deficit is not
expected to show signs of dramatic recovery this year and over the next year
as our exports face difficulties.
'We have to compete with China and south-east Asian countries on price while
our product quality and technology seems to be far behind that of advanced
nations.'
South Korea, which enjoyed multi-million dollar trade surpluses in the late
1980s, has been hit by soaring imports and lagging exports.
It has also suffered from the effects of economic recession in some of its
main markets and a loss of price competitiveness.
A domestic construction boom, excessive consumption and politically
motivated government policies aggravated the deficit, economists said.
The trade deficit, which makes up about 90 per cent of the current account,
ballooned to Dollars 9.66bn on a customs-cleared basis in 1991 from Dollars
4.82bn a year earlier.
The central bank figures showed trade deficits widening with South Korea's
two main partners, the US and Japan.
The chronic deficit with Japan soared to a record Dollars 8.76bn against
Dollars 361m.
South Korea, which had enjoyed a decade of trade surplus with the US, posted
a deficit of Dollars 335.1m from a surplus of Dollars 240.2m in 1990. It was
the first deficit since 1981.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Asia greets Burma human rights abuses with deafening
silence: Latest atrocities by the military junta have failed to spur
neighbouring countries into action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INVISIBLE, inaudible 'Asian way' of dealing with human rights abuses in
Burma is being severely tested by the latest flood of refugees into
neighbouring countries, following a series of army offensives and reported
atrocities against ethnic minorities by the Burmese military junta.
Worst affected have been the Moslems of Arakan in western Burma. In the past
two months about 100,000 of them have fled into Bangladesh with tales of
forced labour, torture, rape and killings at the hands of Burmese soldiers.
And the exodus is continuing.
Yesterday the United Nations World Food Programme said it was granting
Dollars 1.9m in emergency supplies to help Bangladesh cope with the influx
which it estimated at 1,200 refugees a day. Last week the UN High Commission
for Refugees allocated Dollars 1m in emergency funds for the refugees.
Bangladesh said yesterday that thousands of the migrants were on the verge
of starvation because relief efforts were inadequate. Speaking before the
latest UN announcement, one official described food and medical help
received so far as 'only a drop in the vast sea of needs'.
Other ethnic groups and guerrilla armies on Burma's frontiers have suffered,
too, as has the Buddhist majority in whose name the Burmese State Law and
Order Restoration Council (Slorc) claims to be fighting.
Most Asian governments have greeted the actions of the Slorc junta - which
is detaining Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and refuses to give
way to the government-in-waiting elected in 1990 - with a deafening silence.
Amid the growing international outcry over events in Burma, Mr Goh Chok
Tong, Singapore's prime minister, took pains to defend the regional policy
of 'constructive engagement' with Burma during the summit of the Association
of South East Asian Nations (Asean) at the end of last month.
Mr Goh urged his audience of journalists to understand the 'culture of
Asean', which, he explained, involved private discussions rather than
European-style public efforts to change the world. 'We do not interfere,' he
said. 'We just have our bilateral contacts.'
Human-rights activists complain that those contacts include selling arms to
Burma and stripping the country of natural resources such as gems, teak and
fish, while ignoring the plight of the Burmese.
Western companies have also been criticised for dealing with Burma,
esp-ecially in oil exploration, but western governments have roundly
condemned the Burmese authorities.
A loose alliance of Burmese opposition groups based in the beleaguered town
of Manerplaw on the Thai border is now hoping to persuade Asian governments
that they need to take a firm line against Burma in the interests of
regional security, however unmoved they may be by human rights abuses.
Bangladesh has appealed for international help in handling the refugees. At
least one Bangladeshi soldier has been killed by Burmese troops.
Thailand - another destination for refugees - has already seen
confrontations this year between its border patrols and the Burmese army.
The Thai press has criticised both the Burmese and Thai governments over
human rights in Burma, and Thai Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun said
bluntly last month: 'I don't like what's happening in Burma.'
A small number of refugees have also fled to Nagaland State in India, whose
government has been one of the few in Asia to take a strong moral stand
against the actions of the Burmese authorities.
Burma's opposition will nevertheless find it difficult to persuade Asia to
isolate the junta. China, Burma's principal arms supplier, appears to be
unimpressed by the pleas of the Burmese people.
Thailand is ambivalent. The foreign ministry is sensitive to western
criticism on the issue of Burma and the government as a whole is anxious to
keep the country's borders secure, but the military is notorious for its
profitable part in stripping Burma of its teak trees.
Burmese rebel groups, however, believe that the Thais are reluctant to allow
the Burmese army to overrun Manerplaw, which is controlled by the Karen
National Union with the assistance of monks, students and politicians from
Rangoon.
Opponents of the junta want the UN to take a much stronger line on Burma (so
far there has been only a mild resolution passed by consensus in the General
Assembly), even if they recognise that the UN is unlikely to recognise the
Manerplaw-based elected government.
They also want economic sanctions imposed on Burma, and in this area they
believe that western countries are no less guilty than Burma's silent Asian
neighbours and Japan.
'Without economic sanctions, the Slorc can get cash to buy arms,' says Mr
Hla Phay, spokesman in Bangkok for the National League for Democracy, the
party which won the Burmese elections but which was excluded from power.
Asian and western governments, however, doubt the effectiveness of
sanctions. As Mr Anand said: 'Burma is not now ready to listen to anybody.'

FT  25 FEB 92 / Unemployment could reach 6m, says minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT in the Russian federation could rise to 6m unless the
government can encourage rapid expansion of the small and medium-sized
private enterprise sector, Professor Alexander Shokhin, the labour minister
and deputy prime minister of the federation, said in London yesterday.
Mr Shokhin, attending a conference organised by Britain's Employment
Department, said unem ployment could be held to 2m if a systematic programme
of public works, self-employment, and privatisation of retail outlets was
speeded up. The official unemployment level is around 500,000.
However, Mr Shokhin said the Russian government was facing many obstacles
towards implementation of the reforms.
In particular, he said, communist party apparatchiks at the local level
continued to wield considerable power. 'The gap between the federal
structures and the local level is very wide. We can issue any number of
decrees, but it is very difficult to implement them on the local level,' Mr
Shokhin said. He also targeted the layers of bureaucracy in the ministries,
as well as the plethora of committees under parliamentary control, which
continue to delay implementation of the reforms.
'It is very difficult to translate ideas and laws into reality. There are
many decision-making bodies, even at the centre. We spend a lot of our time
going from one body to the other,' he explained.
Nevertheless, the minister is cautiously optimistic about what has been
achieved since January when the first reforms, including price
liberalisation, were introduced.
Soft credits by banks to enterprises have been reduced; the central bank now
identifies with the Russian government's tight monetary policies; and a
timetable, geared to introducing land reform and property rights, should be
ready by April.
'And that is when we want to officially join the International Monetary
Fund,' said Mr Shokhin.

Hungary recorded its healthiest ever balance of payments in 1991, according
to official figures released yesterday, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest.
Capital inflow surged 156 per cent to Dollars 1.46bn (Pounds 830m) on a wave
of foreign investment in privatisations and greenfield developments, the
National Bank of Hungary said. Hungary claims to have attracted 50-60 per
cent of investment in east Europe.
The current account balance also improved in 1991, showing a record Dollars
267m surplus which comfortably surpassed the Dollars 1.2bn deficit agreed
with the International Monetary Fund.
Better than expected capital and current account flows helped the central
bank to nearly quadruple hard-currency reserves from Dollars 1.1bn to
Dollars 4bn over the course of 1991.
The balance of payments is a point of light amid the gloom of recession.
Official figures put industrial production down 19 per cent in 1991 and
gross domestic production down 7-9 per cent.

A SLIGHT improvement in business confidence and economic activity in east
Germany was reported yesterday, but not enough to allay widespread concern
about the slow pace of new private investment, and rising unemployment wage
pressures.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl joined the fray with a new plea for east German
workers to restrain their pay demands to avoid exacerbating the traumatic
restructuring process of east German industry in which tens of thousands
stand to lose their jobs.
He was backed by the German employers' association, which called for new
wage deals to be put on ice, for fear that soaring wage costs would deter
investors.
The unions, on the other hand, called on the government to put pressure on
more big industrial concerns to invest in manufacturing in addition to the
service sector.
The state of the east German economy, where unemployment rose last month by
306,000 to 1.34m with the ending of special subsidies for short-time
working, was the subject of continuing concern at a top-level meeting of
business, trade union and government leaders in the Chancellor's office
yesterday.
The greatest worry is on the fate of more than 6,000 former state
enterprises still on the books of the Treuhand privatisation agency, which
must decide to restructure them or close them down if it cannot find private
purchasers.
Mr Kohl reserved his strongest words for the wage pressures coming from the
workers themselves, warning that a 20 per cent pay increase would add DM10bn
(Pounds 3.4bn) to the annual budget of the Treuhand - at the expense of the
whole restructuring effort.
The Treuhand had to do its job within a limited budget, and he urged both
employers and unions to hold back in their pay deals.
At the same time, he agreed that conflicting property claims and poor
administration were also causing big problems for would-be investors.
Meanwhile, the Ifo economic institute in Munich reported a continued very
slight improvement in eastern business confidence, although actual levels of
activity remain massively depressed.
One third of east German enterprises expected improvement, mainly in
exports. However, four out of five cited important handicaps to output
growth, dominated by marketing problems caused by the wrong product mix,
excessive prices, or inadequate quality. Financing was the second largest
problem area. For the first time in living memory, employees at Commerzbank
in Frankfurt had a choice of only one meal at lunchtime yesterday, writes
David Waller. That was possibly the most tangible evidence of the first
banking strike in Germany since the war, and the first strike in Germany's
current wage round.
Yesterday's strike followed the failure of negotiations with employers last
week. The unions are demanding a pay rise of 10.5 per cent and shorter
working hours. The employers have imposed a flat 5 per cent.

MALTA'S ruling Nationalist Party of Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami
yesterday declared itself the winner of the country's general election,
Reuter reports.
A government spokesman said the Nationalists won 51 per cent of Saturday's
vote against 47 per cent for the Labour party, giving them an expected
three-seat majority. Full results are expected today. Previously Mr Fenech
Adami had a single-seat majority.

FT  25 FEB 92 / EC retreat on energy tax likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is unlikely to press the case for an energy tax
aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions unless the US and Japan show
signs of following the same route, because of the effect on European
competitiveness.
Brussels had planned to deal with this through exemptions to
energy-intensive industries such as chemicals, until the EC's main trading
partners accepted the need for fiscal weapons to curb global warming.
The Commission is still considering options which might allow the EC to
press ahead alone. But Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, environment commissioner, has
acknowledged that 'conditionality (introduction of the tax only if the US
and Japan took similar measures) in this case is likely to be
indispensable.'
The test will come at June's 'earth summit' in Rio de Janeiro, by when the
Commission hopes to have the conditional backing of the Twelve for the
planned tax. This is a mixed levy on energy and fossil fuels, starting at
Dollars 3 a barrel in 1993 and rising to Dollars 10 in the year 2000, by
when the EC has undertaken to reduce CO emissions to 1990 levels.
accepted German plans for a single EC law which would sweep away all
internal frontier controls in the Community at a stroke will get tentative
backing from the Commission at a ministers' meeting in Brussels today,
writes Andrew Hill.
At the moment, member states are proceeding on a case-by-case basis.

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER sharp fall in Russia's industrial production is inevitable but
action will be taken to stimulate sectors which decline by more than 50 per
cent over the next few months, the Russian government said yesterday.
Mr Andrei Nechayev, head of the newly recreated Economics Ministry, forecast
that output would fall 'significantly' in the next two months as a result of
the government's tight monetary and credit policy. The first sector likely
to experience a slump was agricultural machinery, but taxation and other
financial benefits would be deployed to help.
The minister also announced plans to free the domestic price of oil and gas
at the end of April as part of the effort to stabilise prices. The step will
deal a further blow to industry accustomed to cheap energy.
The state-controlled domestic price of oil is Rbs350 a tonne. The price of
coal is also to be freed on April 15, although the price of coking coal,
crucial to the metallurgy industry, is to remain fixed.
Pleading for restraint on the part of workers to help avoid hyperinflation,
Mr Nechayev said that the government's agreement under duress to increase
the pay of coalminers in the northern Voruta region was a dangerous
precedent which could spark a chain reaction and torpedo the government's
whole reform programme. He said prices this month had risen 10-12 per cent
compared to last February.
The Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs produced figures
showing that industrial output in the whole of the former Soviet Union had
fallen 17 per cent in January.
Although the defence industry is being cut, the 27 per cent fall in steel
production for January will hurt other industries such as agricultural
machinery. Coal output was down 10 per cent and oil 12 per cent.
Professor Yeveny Yasin, the industrialists' prominent economist, warned that
production in the next two months could fall to half last year's level. He
said the decline was partly because of the disruption of traditional
supplies between enterprises, and partly because of tight credit.
Russia, the only one of the former Soviet republics to have made debt
payments, is refusing to attend debt talks organised by the Ukrainians in
Kiev today. Russian officials said they were irritated by Ukraine's failure
to send a high-level official to a meeting on the more than Dollars 60bn
debt in Moscow yesterday, as well as by the fact it had not taken part in
previous debt meetings.
Ukraine, which wants to pay its share separately and rejects a memorandum
undertaking joint and several responsibility for the debt, joined the
meeting in Moscow, but did not adhere to any of its conclusions.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Spanish keep eye on UK rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SLIGHT easing in money-market interest rates in Madrid late last week has
generated strong speculation in the Spanish capital that the Bank of Spain
will trim its official intervention rate at a regular bill auction today.
Bank of Spain officials declined to comment on rumours that they might
reduce the intervention rate, now at 12.65 per cent. But senior Spanish
officials have hinted for the past two weeks that they might be prepared to
cut rates if the UK, in an effort to stimulate the British economy ahead of
a general election, were to do likewise.
The peseta and sterling currently mark the ceiling and floor respectively of
the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism and their rates of
exchange are obliged to remain within 6 per cent of each other.
In a newspaper interview at the weekend Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance
minister, conceded that Spain might have to follow a UK cut.
'The impact (of a UK cut) on Spanish rates will depend on how deep it is. If
the UK cut is small we may not have to cut ours,' he said.
There was no indication last night in London of an imminent cut in UK base
rates, now at 10.5 per cent.
Inflation is likely to continue rising in Spain for most of the first
quarter, and most Spanish analysts insist that there are, at present, no
pressing domestic reasons for easing monetary policy.
But Mr Solchaga also noted that the apparent slowing in wage rises this year
would provide some relief for the authorities in case they are forced to cut
rates today.
The recent strength of the US dollar has also weakened the D-Mark against
the Spanish currency, which would allow a rate cut in Madrid to be easily
accommodated in the markets.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOARE GOVETT, the UK stockbroker owned by the US bank Security Pacific,
yesterday ended two years of speculation about its future by announcing that
ABN Amro Bank of the Netherlands had agreed to be its new parent.
The proposed takeover of Hoare Govett's European operations, including its
large client list of British blue chip companies, marks the Dutch group's
most energetic push into European investment banking since it was formed in
1990 by the merger of ABN and Amro.
The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Security Pacific will recover
most of its capital of about Pounds 70m tied up in stockbroking.
Even after the sale of Hoare Govett's remaining Asian businesses, Security
Pacific is still likely to have lost more than half of its total investment
of some Pounds 100m. It bought control of Hoare Govett in December 1984, and
took full ownership in 1987.
Security Pacific's results for the fourth quarter of 1991 included a Dollars
65m (Pounds 37m) writedown on its investment in the broker in anticipation
of a sale.
Since Security Pacific merged with Bank of America last October and the two
Californian banks decided that UK stockbroking had no place in their future,
Hoare Govett has courted half-a-dozen potential backers. However, serious
talks with ABN Amro did not begin until last month.
One obstacle had been the desire of Hoare Govett's management to preserve a
role in the firm's direction.
Mr Peter Meinertzhagen, chairman, said yesterday that the deal had the full
support of management and that the broking firm would operate independently
within ABN Amro.
'We expect the relationship to work very well - they're only an hour away,'
he added.
Last month Hoare Govett cut 60 staff from its workforce of 440, seen by
other stockbrokers as a necessary step for a deal.
ABN Amro decided not to buy Hoare Govett's Asian operations because the
group already has a presence in Asia. The Asian businesses, which employ
several hundred people, are now searching separately for potential backers.
At the time of Hoare Govett's unsuccessful management buy-out in late 1990,
they were estimated to be worth half the European businesses.
ABN Amro already has banking and broking operations in France through
majority stakes in Neuflize Schlumberger Mallet and Massonaud Fontenay, in
Holland under in its own name and through the Pierson Heldring &amp; Pierson
investment bank, and under its own name in Germany and Switzerland.

FT  25 FEB 92 / US rift with Israel deepens: Threat to Dollars 10bn loan
guarantees unless settlements are halted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US risked a serious rift with Israel yesterday by refusing to provide
Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6bn) in loan guarantees unless the Jewish state stops
building settlements in Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war.
The tough US attitude was spelled out publicly for the first time by Mr
James Baker, secretary of state, only minutes after peace negotiations
between Arab and Israeli delegations resumed at the State Department.
Israeli settlements had already become a key issue at the negotiations. The
Arabs had threatened to walk out if the US guaranteed loans which Israel
wants to help house immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
This is the worst setback Israel has suffered in its relations with the US
for many years and could have an impact on the Israeli general election on
June 23.
Israel indicated it would refuse to back down on settlements, but appeared
at pains to find some reassurance for the US.
'We will not capitulate on settlements nor on the loan guarantees,' an
Israeli diplomat in Washington said. 'I think a compromise can be reached in
a manner which does not violate US policy.'
Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, said the loan guarantees were not yet
lost and he hoped they could be won with 'joint effort'. Urging calm, Mr
Yitzhak Modai, the finance minister, said on Israeli television: 'I would
suggest that we don't lose control.'
The US has been at odds with Israel over the issue for months. President
George Bush created a furore last autumn when he insisted on a 120-day delay
in Congressional consideration of the loan guarantee request, in spite of
heavy lobbying by US Jewish organisations.
Earlier this month Israeli ministers had expressed confidence that the US
would agree to their request, although they complained bitterly that the US
was constantly shifting its ground in talks about it.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister, has always insisted that
settlements would continue to be built. Just before Mr Baker's announcement,
he accused the US of siding with Arabs and said: 'We cannot under any
circumstances go along with the principle that Jews have no right to live in
this or that part of the Land of Israel.'
Mr Baker, testifying yesterday before the House of Representatives foreign
aid appropriations committee, said he was offering Israel a choice.
It could stop building settlements and get loan guarantees of up to Dollars
2bn a year for the next five years. Alternatively, a deal could be struck to
let Israel complete settlement work under way on, say, January 1, with the
cost of completion deducted from the amount the US would guarantee.
Mr Baker also made clear he was not referring just to house building when he
talked about 'settlement activity'. He also meant clearing land and putting
in infrastructure. Mr Baker said if Israel agreed to the terms, the US would
insist on monitoring the agreement every 12 months to ensure the terms were
adhered to. Israel initially asked for a single agreement to cover five
years.
Mr Faisal al-Husseini, leader of the Palestinian delegation to the peace
talks, had said on Sunday the whole process would be in danger of collapse
without a clear signal from Washington on the loan guarantees.
The Palestinians did not take part in the multilateral peace negotiations in
Moscow earlier this month, which were also boycotted by Syria and Lebanon.
The arrival of all the delegations in Washington this week suggested they
anticipated a more forceful US position. Mr Husseini said if Israel got the
loan guarantees 'Washington would be destroying the peace process with its
own hands'.
Other Arab delegates pointed out that the US decision would not affect more
than Dollars 3bn a year in civil and military aid that Israel already got
from the US. They said US moves to reduce this amount would be the next
logical step if Israel continued building settlements.
Mr Baker stressed during his testimony that the US retained its total and
absolute commitment to the security of Israel.
But the US is also reported to have urged Israel last week to withdraw its
armoured forces from southern Lebanon.
The Arab delegations are demanding that Israel concede the principle of
withdrawing from occupied territories in return for a comprehensive peace as
set out in UN Resolutions 242 and 338.
Israel has said so far that it has nothing to offer beyond peace.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Dispute over Lloyd's inquiry head
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH DISAGREEMENT over Lloyd's looks set to surface today when a group of
loss-making Names confronts Mr David Coleridge, the chairman, over the
handling of alleged malpractices at the insurance market.
The Names - individuals whose personal assets provide the insurance market's
capital - are particularly concerned about the appointment of Sir David
Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, the investment
watchdog, to oversee investigations.
Some Names who will meet Mr Coleridge today plan to question Sir David's
independence. Sir David is a member of the Lloyd's governing council.
'There is a suspicion he won't do anything to embarrass his friends in the
club,' Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Names Action
Group, said yesterday. 'We want to know what the terms of reference are.'
He stressed that his stance should not be interpreted as a personal attack
on Sir David.
This prospective skirmish coincides with the gathering momentum behind the
legal battle between Lloyd's and some of those Names worst affected by the
market's recent losses.
Lloyd's is now in open dispute with several hundred Names who, like Mr
Doll-Steinberg, are members of lossmaking catastrophe reinsurance
syndicates. This follows the decision of Lloyd's to defend a legal action
being brought by Names against the agents who handle their affairs.
The Names are seeking injunctions to prevent Lloyd's from drawing down
deposits that Names placed with their agents when they joined Lloyd's. They
allege the cash calls are legally 'improper'.
The solicitors acting on behalf of Names, Michael Freeman, now expect the
total number of plaintiffs in the action to be over 600. Mr Michael Freeman
said yesterday that the decision of Lloyd's to enter the proceedings 'had
caused a mass of writs from people who otherwise would never have been part
of this action'.
Sir William Clark, the chairman of the Conservative bank bench finance
committee, who leads today's delegation of MPs and Names, said: 'My concern
is that anything that affects the City and any adverse criticism of Lloyd's
would be disastrous for the City generally.'
Mr Doll-Steinberg's remarks followed a meeting of MPs and Names convened at
Westminster yesterday by Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City affairs
spokeswoman, with the aim of keeping the pressure on Lloyd's and improving
co-ordination between the various Lloyd's action groups.
On Friday, the agents agreed to give temporary undertakings to freeze Names'
deposits until the outcome of court hearings fixed for about March 26 was
known.
The Names provided cross undertakings which mean that if their action
ultimately fails they must pay compensation to Lloyd's for any financial
loss suffered.
Lloyd's warned yesterday that these amounts could be substantial since they
would include the 'financing costs of raising money other than by the usual
procedures'.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Airbus is ordered to alter A320 cockpit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government yesterday ordered Airbus Industrie, the European
aircraft consortium, to make changes to the cockpit design of the A320, the
aircraft which crashed in eastern France last month, killing 87.
The instruction, from Mr Paul Quiles, the transport minister, which followed
publication of the independent investigators' preliminary report into the
crash, will be seized upon by critics of one of the most technically
advanced aircraft in the air. They claim that the computerised controls can
confuse pilots and leave them unprepared for emergencies.
The report said changing the cockpit layout could cut the chances of pilot
error. Airbus Industrie immediately set up a team to examine possible
changes, while both Lufthansa, the German airline which has more A320s than
any other carrier, and British Airways said they would study the report's
findings.
The report did not identify the cause of the crash. This should be in the
final version which could take another year to produce.
The investigators made three recommendations: to review the layout of the
descent controls; to make all passenger aircraft carry alarms to alert
pilots when they are approaching the ground; and to review the placing of
the aircraft's emergency radio beacon.
Specifically, there was concern that displays might make it easy to confuse
an instruction by the pilot to the aircraft to descend at a set angle with
one to descend to a set height.
Mr Alain Monnier, head of the inquiry panel, said: 'Among the scenarios we
are studying is a confusion, undetected by the crew, between the two modes
of descent.' He added this 'does not mean that the commission of inquiry has
decided on the most likely scenario or scenarios of this accident'.
Mr Quiles asked the French civil aviation authority to ensure that all
French airlines installed ground proximity alarms - currently not obligatory
in France - by June. Air Inter, the domestic airline operating the A320, had
intended to install such systems by the summer. The minister's instructions
were welcomed by the SNPL national pilots' union.
The crash happened when an A320 operated by Air Inter, the French domestic
airline, hit a mountain ridge on a night approach to Strasbourg airport, in
eastern France.
The A320's radio beacon, which was carried in its nose, was accordingly
smashed on impact, and rescuers took four hours to find the aircraft.

FT  25 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: US still buyers of Saatchi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ADVERTISING agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi continued to attract unusually large
interest on the back of encouraging press reports about the general state of
the industry in the US.
More than 35m Saatchi shares were traded yesterday, and the price firmed a
halfpenny to 17 1/4 p. Since last Wednesday more than 130m shares have been
traded which, taking into consideration the double counting in recorded
turnovers, represents over 4 per cent of the company's share capital.
Observers are confident that the interest is motivated solely by optimism
for economic and industry recovery, rather than by stakebuilding, although
one analyst argued that buyers may be prematurely optimistic. 'There is
light at the end of the tunnel, but it is an extremely long tunnel,' the
analyst commented.
Vickers volatile
There was volatile trading in Vickers shares as the market responded to the
company's full-year figures. The stock fell 10 initially on the loss of
Pounds 12.4m, compared with a profit of Pounds 96.5m last year; the loss was
slightly larger than analysts' forecasts. Sentiment was further weakened by
a lack of news on the full or part disposal of the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars
subsidiary.
The decline was halted after the analysts' meeting and the shares bounced as
the market showed appreciation of the 6p dividend payment, which was at the
top of the range of forecasts, as well as the probability of further tank
orders, and the better cash flow position than had been expected.
The shares ended 7 ahead on balance at 169p on turnover of 2.1m. Mr Clive
Forrestier-Walker at Charterhouse Tilney said: 'This is a very positive
result, despite the continuing weakness in the Rolls-Royce business.' He
forecast 1992 profits of Pounds 37m.
Hanson saw heavy two-way business and closed a  1/4 firmer at 212 3/4 p with
9.7m shares traded. The buyers, who principally came from the US and
appeared to be following a recent push by Goldman Sachs, were given added
incentive yesterday with the publication of a weighty piece of research from
County NatWest's conglomerates team, which looks at the company's long-term
strategy. It argues that in spite of the low rating, negative feelings about
the group are already discounted, that Hanson will receive great benefit
from economic recovery and that any downside is protected by a large and
safe yield.
Food retailers were boosted by positive comments from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
and James Capel. Argyll moved ahead 9 to 327p, J. Sainsbury 11 to 391p and
Tesco 9 to 260p.
Guinness rose 18 to 594p on lack of stock and strong demand. Grand
Metropolitan climbed 5 to 949p before today's annual meeting. Allied-Lyons,
up 8 at 594p, is to buy Modern Maid Products, a US food coating concern,
from Dalgety for Pounds 23m.
Brewers were generally firm, including Bass, up 9 at 557p on turnover of
2.7m. After a visit to Bass on Friday, BZW said it was very happy with a
profits forecast of Pounds 580m for the year to September 1992 and
reiterated its buy recommendation.
Leisure group Ladbroke continued to attract attention ahead of its results,
due in two weeks, gaining 4 to 229p in moderate turnover of 2.2m.
Rank Organisation, which went ex the dividend yesterday, surprised some
observers by shaking off last week's dip in its price, the shares firming 8
to 665p. Forte rose 1 to 231p.
Euro Disney again celebrated its inclusion, in three weeks time, to the CAC
40 index in Paris, the shares gaining 18 to 1573p.
Power generators PowerGen and National Power were firmer with the market,
and also in reflection of a long-term buy note from SG Warburg. PowerGen put
on 6 to 228p and National Power 6 to 219p.
The improved political climate for the Conservatives sent water shares
higher. Northumbrian Water added 5 at 391p, Severn Trent 6 at 341p and
Thames Water 7 at 378p.
Renewed optimism over the economic and political outlook, combined with
positive reflection from last week's figures from Lloyds Bank, boosted the
banking sector. NatWest, which reports today, advanced 11 to 303p as fears
over a rights issue receded. Analyst Mr Steven Thorn at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
said Lloyds' capital ratio figures were significantly better than had been
expected, and the market is hoping NatWest will follow suit.
Barclays, which was unaffected by yesterday's Swaps court ruling, rose on
the general sentiment in the sector by 11 to 398p.
Support ahead off the full-year results, which are due today, helped
SmithKline Beecham units to improve 15 to 4150p, although the 'A' shares
were flat at 928p.
ICI appreciated 22 to 1317p ahead of full-year results expected on Thursday.
The stock was also said to have received some support from a strategic note
by Credit Lyonnais Laing.
Glaxo, which went ex a 6p dividend yesterday, declined 6 to 813p, with some
UK doubts still lingering from last week's results. Also, Merck, the US
company which Glaxo tends to follow, had fallen by Dollars 1 in the previous
session on Wall Street.
Turnover in BP increased sharply after Wall Street opened. The shares
started quietly in London at the day's low of 255p, but finished only 1/2
off at 258p following good US buying. Volume was little more than 5m shares
in the early afternoon, but 18m by the close. Both BP and Shell went
ex-dividend yesterday, with Shell losing 3 to 445p.
Speculation in the weekend press that British Aerospace was to hive off its
business jet and property operations, a move which could raise Pounds 650m
for the company, helped the shares remain firm as the company made a 16.1p
dividend payment. The stock finished 6 up at 300p.
Bargain hunters continued in Tiphook, helping the shares end 33 ahead at
345p on healthy turnover of 2.7m.
Initial disappointment at NFC's first-quarter results released on Sunday
gave rise to early selling and the shares closed 9 lower at 230p.
Hopes of an economic recovery over the past year have been largely shadowed
by the banks sector, as it has tried to move out of recession. A year ago,
the sector received a boost from the leading banks' results, which were
better than expected. A tight UK Budget and pessimistic economic outlook
pulled the sector down through the early summer, but it rallied on recovery
hopes in July and August. These had receded by September and the banks index
fell away. Since then, political uncertainty ahead of the general election,
with worries over dividends and provisions, have prompted volatility.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Appointments: Hodge Mark 3
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Julian Hodge, the 87-year-old Welsh financier, has long since retired
from active duty but his name lives on at the Julian Hodge Bank where his
son, Julian, is strengthening the management team.
Richard Mathias, aged 43, has been recruited from Midland Bank to fill the
new post of deputy general manager. Richard Cave, managing director of the
bank and one of Sir Julian's longest-serving lieutenants, says that the new
appointment reflects the bank's commitment to South Wales generally and
Cardiff in particular. 'It is most appropriate that in addition to many
years experience in banking, Mathias was born and bred a Welshman and is
Welsh-speaking,' says Cave.
The Julian Hodge Bank is the Hodge family's latest attempt to establish a
significant Welsh financial institution. Sir Julian, who started life as a
railway clerk and sold insurance door-to-door in the evenings, disposed of
his first venture - the Hodge Group - to Standard Chartered in the mid-1970s
and sat on the new owner's board for some years. His second banking
initiative - the Commercial Bank of Wales - was bought by Bank of Scotland
in 1986.
Compared with earlier Hodge banks, the family-owned Julian Hodge Bank is a
modest affair with assets of Pounds 84m, shareholders' funds of Pounds 38m
and pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.5m a year. It specialises in lending to
commercial and industrial customers and operates out of a single office in
Cardiff's Windsor Place.
*****
David Clifton, md of CRODA INTERNATIONAL's universal division, is appointed
to the main board. Stan Cressey, md of Croda's speciality chemicals sector,
is to retire at the end of March.
*****
Michael Schuetzendorf has been appointed operations director Hilton
International London.
*****
David Dewhurst is appointed group finance director of STRONG &amp; FISHER; he
moves from the head office of Hillsdown Holdings which is a majority
shareholder of Strong &amp; Fisher.
*****
David Pearce has been appointed chairman and chief executive of KING &amp;
SHAXSON HOLDINGS following the death of William D'Abbans; David Mason is
appointed company secretary in place of David Jarrett who remains a managing
director.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Appointments: Welsh Water plugged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Holes in the senior management at Welsh Water created by the surprise
departure of managing director David Jeffrey at the end of last year have
now been plugged. Paul Twamley, a partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte for
the past 11 years, has been hired as finance director, replacing Graham
Hawker, who was promoted to fill Jeffrey's spot in January.
Twamley, who has worked in Wales all his life, and for 28 years as a
chartered accountant, specialised latterly in corporate finance, with
geographic responsibilities for the West of England as well as Wales. He was
also the audit partner for Welsh Water until two years ago.
When Coopers merged with Deloitte's, the terms of the deal meant that it was
the senior partner of Deloitte's who secured the top position in the merged
entity. Twamley had been senior partner at Coopers.
He acknowledges that one of the most important aspects of the job - managing
relations with the City - will represent a new departure for him. But Graham
Hawker, he says, is well versed in that department and will be hand-holding
'until the City feels it can deal with me'.
*****
Perhaps with an eye to local sensitivities, Britain's biggest bank has
decided put a Welshman in charge of the biggest part of its Welsh business.
Gareth George, 42, is taking over as Barclays Bank's regional director for
South Wales on June 1.
Having joined the bank in 1971, he is now moving from Birmingham to Cardiff
 -very much a return home. He was born and brought up in the Rhondda valley
and went to Cardiff University.
As a 'fanatical' rugger man he welcomes the chance to be among sympathetic
colleagues for a change; at Birmingham, where he has been personal sector
director for the past five years, he was the butt of all the anti-Welsh
jokes every time Wales lost. Like many successful clearing bankers, George
has done more than his fair share of charitable work and became national
president of the Round Table at 39.
George is replacing Englishman, Grant Walshe, who is retiring on reaching
60. Having been brought in from Bristol, Walshe is regarded as having done a
good job nursing the bank's business in a local economy which has been hit
hard by the problems in farming and traditional heavy industries.
He quickly established himself in Cardiff business-life where no function is
complete without his bonhomie and booming voice. He is staying on in the
city among his bridge friends. 'I bring a civilising English touch,' he
says.

FT  25 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: France and Mexico gain from buoyant US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Significant movements in second-line markets were disguised by a muted
global equity performance last week. According to the FT-Actuaries World
indices, the world index rose just 0.2 per cent in local currency terms.
France was the week's biggest gainer, advancing 4.5 per cent and returning
to levels seen just before Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. The market
accelerated during the week in big volume as foreign and domestic investors
aggressively bought stocks with exposure to cyclical industries and to the
US economy, ahead of the close of the February account on Friday.
Analysts attribute the bourse's bullish mood to Wall Street, which reached a
record high on Thursday, the stronger dollar, and to the sheer weight of
money as international investors switched funds out of Germany and into
France.
The market has also been encouraged by positive comments on the economy from
the finance minister and by signs that the government is committed to
improving the stock market's fortunes by creating personal equity plans and
further privatisations. There is a general belief among analysts that French
equities have further to run.
Mexico followed France with a 3.6 per cent rise in local terms, also buoyed
by Wall Street, the prospect of lower interest rates, and foreign buying
pressure. News on Friday that foreigners will be allowed to buy financial
shares is expected to keep the market strong in the near term.
Hopes of cheaper money produced a 3 per cent gain in Malaysia, where cuts in
deposit rates by local banks undermined efforts by the central bank to keep
interbank rates above 8 per cent.
Malaysia was also lifted by speculative buying in the gaming sector. Tanjong
was heavily bought on reports that its controlling shareholder planned to
develop Kuala Lumpur's race course into a 'city within a city'.
By contrast, South Africa was the week's worst performer, losing 4.2 per
cent in the wake of the government's defeat in a local by-election and
President FW de Klerk's announcement of a referendum on his reform
programme. Lower gold prices, which took 7 per cent off the local market's
all-gold index, were also to blame.
One analyst says the market is unlikely to recover from the weight of rights
issues currently under way until well into the next quarter. Some R6.7bn
(Dollars 2.4bn), a large sum for the South African market, has already been
raised in cash calls so far this year.
South African equities are also depressed by the effects of the worst
drought in decades, which is likely to slow economic growth to 1.5 per cent,
down from previous forecasts of 2 per cent, and reduce the trade surplus
this year. A downturn in consumer spending is a further weight on the
market.
The week's second worst performer was Norway, which fell 3.6 per cent,
depressed by weaker oil prices following the Opec meeting and by a record
net loss in 1991 from Norsk Hydro, the market leader.

FT  25 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): CAC-40 nears 2,000 at start of
new account
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTINENT started the week in a positive mood, though trading became
increasingly technical, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS rose for the sixth consecutive day as the new account opened, but it
came off the day's high on afternoon profit-taking. Dealers reported that a
large US sell program hit the market just before the close. The CAC-40 index
reached 1,993.44 at midday but closed at 1,976.52, up 14.15. Volume eased to
FFr3.6bn from FFr4.3bn.
Dealers were divided about the CAC-40's chances of rising above 2,000 this
week. The CAC-40 was last above 2,000 on July 20, 1990. Some were worried
that the bourse was running out of steam and that there would not be enough
volume to push the index through this chart resistance point.
Euro Disney rose another FFr1.70 to FFr154.70 with 775,900 shares following
last week's news that it would replace Perrier in the Cac-40.
Cerus, the French holding company of the Italian entrepreneur Mr Carlo de
Benedetti, added FFr5.20 to FFr134.50 on rumours that a third party wanted a
10 per cent stake. Hachette and Matra advanced FFr13.50 and FFr5
respectively to FFr166 and FFr180 as investors searched for laggards.
FRANKFURT overcame a hesitant start and ended at another 18-month high.
Dealers cautioned that the market was becoming too technical and had lost
touch with fundamentals, such as the slowing economy and the increased cost
pressure on earnings. The DAX index closed 11.47 higher at 1,729.10, while
the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, rose 5.32 to 701.98. Volume fell to
DM6.9bn from DM8.6bn.
Viag rose DM6.30 to DM379.80 after reporting an expected 20.5 per cent rise
in 1991 profit. The mechanical engineering sector was also firmer with
Preussag up DM4.80 to DM381.80 and Linde DM14 higher at DM817.
MILAN was encouraged by good February inflation data and prices continued to
firm in the after-market. The Comit index rose 3.51 to 540.08 in turnover
estimated at L80bn after L84.5bn.
Eridania, which is about to come under the control of its French subsidiary
Beghin-Say, saw its ordinary shares rise L266 or 4 per cent to L6,900, while
its saving shares added L215 or 4.3 per cent to L5,240. Dealers said these
gains reflected late demand on Friday and that volume was light.
Cementir fell another L16 to L2,495 as the stock's speculative premium
evaporated. The stock has lost 10 per cent since last Thursday, when it
became clear that Caltagirone, Cementir's new majority shareholder, would
not buy out minority shareholders.
MADRID rose on speculation that the central bank would cut interest rates
today. The general index gained 1.40 to 260.35 in turnover estimated at
Pta12bn. Telefonica reversed some of last week's losses to end up Pta40 or
3.6 per cent to Pta1,135.
AMSTERDAM consolidated after Friday's rally, as 1991 results due from
Unilever today and Philips on Thursday kept activity low. The CBS Tendency
Index edged up 0.1 to 126.2. KLM fell 40 cents to Fl 40.10 in active trading
following weekend reports that merger talks with BA had reached a critical
stage. Royal Dutch recovered from last week's poor results, moving up Fl 1.6
to Fl 143.40. Akzo, which reports 1991 results tomorrow, gained Fl 1.20 to
Fl 145.50.
BRUSSELS rose to a 10-month high following a cut in the central bank's
seven-day advances rate. The Bel-20 index gained 14.35, or 1.2 per cent, to
1,196.89 in turnover of BFr1.25bn.
CBR, the cement group, put on BFr400 to BFr8,750.0 on speculation that SGB
might sell its 43 per cent stake.
ZURICH closed firmer, though uncertainty over the direction of German and US
interest rates made investors cautious. The all-share SPI index rose 5.8 to
1,139.5, having earlier reached a high of 1,140.1.
STOCKHOLM ended mixed in quiet trade, the Affarsvarlden General Index down
0.3 to 931.3. Astra free B-shares, having risen as high as SKr577, finished
up SKr5 at SKr570. Ericsson free B's lost early gains and closed unchanged
at SKr113.
HELSINKI waited for results from Repola and Nokia, due later in the week.
The HEX index put on 7.9 to 935.9 in turnover of FM34.5m.
ISTANBUL fell to a three-month low, the 75-share index closing down 381.62
or 9.6 per cent to 3,603.89.

FT  25 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Kuwait delays bourse reopening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE reopening of Kuwait's stock exchange, closed since the Iraqi invasion in
August 1990, has been delayed until the government finalises an ambitious
plan to write off all banking debt in the emirate, writes Mark Nicholson,
Middle East Correspondent.
Exchange officials indicated in January that the market, which had an annual
turnover of around Dollars 3bn before the Gulf war, might open next month.
However, they now say that they are still awaiting financial reports from
the 56 listed companies - which cannot be prepared until the debt plan is
approved.
Details of the buy-out are still being discussed by the National Council,
Kuwait's interim assembly, and approval is expected by the end of March. The
government is proposing to buy KD5.84bn (Dollars 20bn) of debts from the
banks and finance houses in return for a special sale of government bonds.
Some KD1.9bn of the debt is a residue from the 1982 collapse of the informal
Souq al Manakh stock market, the remainder being debts outstanding to banks
before the Gulf war.
Once the debt scheme is approved, bourse officials say the market could
reopen within weeks.

THE NIKKEI average fell below 21,000 as worries ahead of testimonies by a
leading politician concerning a political bribery scandal, scheduled for
today, and the dollar's rebound against the yen discouraged investors,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index finished 318.57 down at 20,973.24 after opening at the day's high
of 21,286.70 and hitting the day's low of 20,890.37 just before the close.
Turnover shrank to 130m shares from Friday's 200m, the lowest so far this
year. Declines overwhelmed advances by 639 to 287, with 188 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 14.84 at
1,536.82, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.90 to 1,172.72.
News that Mr Zenko Suzuki, the former prime minister, will testify in
today's parliamentary session regarding his involvement in a political
bribery scandal prompted light selling.
Hopes of a cut in the discount rate, which had buoyed share prices last
week, also receded, and rumours of a rise in the capital gains tax sent
jitters through the market. Pessimism about the expiry of March futures
contracts also prevailed.
Concern about corporate earnings depressed the high-technology sector.
Nippondenso, a car air-conditioner maker with close ties with Toyota,
weakened Y60 to Y1,260 on reports of record low sales and pre-tax profits
for the current year to March.
Companies predicting that they would fall into the red in the current year
lost ground. Victor of Japan fell Y50 to Y1,110 and Ricoh Y13 to Y550.
Tokio Marine and Fire dipped Y20 to Y1,060 on reports that claims for
typhoon damages would erode its earnings.
Speculative issues were among the few gainers of the day, on short-term
buying. Clarion rose Y40 to Y1,230 and Nippon Carbon Y80 to Y1,920.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 5.19 to 22,673.97 in volume of 181.9m
shares. Traders attributed 95 per cent of the activity to cross-trading
ahead of the March book closing. Companies with connections to the Sumitomo
group were briskly traded. Sanyo Electric, the day's busiest issue, held at
Y493 and Sumitomo Chemical was flat at Y435.
Roundup
AUSTRALIA recorded its highest close for more than a month, while the rest
of the Pacific Rim was mixed.
AUSTRALIA rose on optimism about tomorrow's economic statement. The All
Ordinaries index gained 5.5 to 1,627.0 in turnover of ADollars 208m, against
ADollars 235m.
CRA climbed 16 cents to ADollars 13.98: analysts said a weaker Australian
dollar and hopes of an upturn in commodity prices was boosting the mining
sector. Commonwealth Bank put on 7 cents to ADollars 7.30 after the
government said it did not plan to sell any of its 70 per cent holding.
HONG KONG slipped more than 30 points in the first hour of trading before
rallying slightly. The Hang Seng index ended 20.85 off at 4,175.62 in
turnover of HKDollars 1.6bn, down from HKDollars 2.1bn. Wharf Holdings
retreated 30 cents to HKDollars 12.40 on rumours of an offer of Wharf
warrants by Hong Kong Realty.
SEOUL eased as investors grew cautious ahead of the general election on
March 24. The composite index shed 3.23 to 637.73 in 18.69m shares.
TAIWAN's weighted index, up 60 points initially, finished a net 4.56 down at
5,070.24 in turnover of TDollars 59bn. Reports that the central bank planned
to remove its ban on foreign equity investment lifted financial stocks.
NEW ZEALAND fell as forestry stocks declined. The NZSE-40 index receded
10.14 to 1,489.55 in turnover of NZDollars 19m. Fletcher Challenge shed 6

FT  25 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: South American problems lift
copper and zinc prices

<TEXT>
COPPER AND Zinc prices rose strongly on the London Metal Exchange yesterday
following news of wildcat strikes in Chile and supply problems in Peru.
Analysts thought prices of both metals were likely to continue rising in the
next few days. Copper for delivery in three months, which yesterday reached
Dollars 2,237 a tonne, its highest level for two and a half months, could
jump by another Dollars 100 a tonne, driven up by technical factors, they
said.
In Chile the world's biggest underground copper mine, El Teniente, owned by
the Chilean Copper Corporation, was hit by a protest against the weekend
sacking of 150 miners.
About 2,000 of El Teniente's 9,500 employees downed tools for an hour to
demand the their colleagues' reinstatement. The stoppage affected production
at the mine, the crushing and concentrating plant, and at the Caletones
smelter.
Union leaders were due to meet today to consider further action. The
protests were sparked by Codelco's attempts to impose a voluntary redundancy
scheme to reduce overmanning. The state-owned company says it wants to shed
800 workers at El Teniente by mid-year.
But Mr Jose Donoso, a union leader at the mine, said Codelco was victimising
miners who had been ill in the past. 'Workers are being forced to take the
redundancy package. The scheme is not voluntary at all,' he said.
El Teniente's refined copper output in 1991 totalled 278,765 tonnes, about
25 per cent of Codelco's total. The mine was also hit by pay strikes last
year. Production has declined in recent years because of the exhaustion of
reserves and rock bursts that have closed down important sections of the
underground tunnels.
Meanwhile, Peru's biggest zinc refinery, Minero Peru's Cajamarquilla,
declared force majeure on metal shipments. It said output was being cut by
power rationing. Cajamarquilla raised production last year to 93,000 tonnes
of zinc from 60,964 tonnes in 1990 when Minero Peru suffered a two-month
strike and frequent electricity cuts. Power supply problems are caused
mainly by attacks on electricity pylons by the Shining Path, an extreme
left-wing guerrilla group.
On the LME zinc for immediate delivery closed last night at Dollars 1,120 a
tonne, up Dollars 11.50, while three-month metal was Dollars 1,139.50 a
tonne, up Dollars 12. Copper ended Pounds 16.25 up at Pounds 1,277.50 a
tonne for spot metal while three-months metal was Pounds 13.50 ahead at
Pounds 1,298.75 a tonne. Analysts suggested that copper's reaction to
potential supply problems was reasonable in that stocks were low and falling
on both the LME and the New York Commodity Exchange. However, zinc stocks
were likely to go on rising.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: A pleasant surprise for NZ wool
growers - An upturn in sales and prices that has lifted the gloom in the
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE HAS been a sharp and unexpected turnround in the fortunes of New
Zealand's wool farmers. Wool fetched the highest prices at auction for 18
months last week, thanks to a shortfall in supply, a rise in overseas demand
and a sharply lower Kiwi dollar.
The market indicator was 494 cents (153p) - 25 per cent up from early last
month. Each sale has seen another sharp rise, and this is beginning to worry
exporters, who feel this trend, if it continues, will frighten off buyers.
At recent sales buyers from all main markets, Western Europe, the Middle
East, Asia and the Far East, were active and the market was supported by
locally-based exporters who had entered into contracts some time ago and now
had to fulfil them.
The indicator was set at 391 cents on December 5 and rose to 428 on January
23, 450 cents on February 5 to 462 cents on February 15 and 494 cents on
February 20. That was the highest price since August 1990, when farmers
received price support payments from the wool board. Last week's sale was
the first occassion since then that farmers had received more than the
Dollars 4.85 a kilogram that the board guaranteed.
The sustained rise in prices has taken the industry by surprise: in November
it was widely predicted by industry analysts that the indicator would slip
back to 370 when the bulk of the crossbred clip came on the market.
By historic standards, however, wool is still inexpensive, especially in
overseas currency terms, given the 15 per cent devaluation of the New
Zealand dollar over the past 18 months and the much higher prices of the
mid-1980s. The Wool Board analysts say that the recent rise may still not be
sufficient to halt the drift of farmers out of sheep and into beef
production, where returns are better. Even with the latest rise, the average
sheep farm will still only earn an average NZDollars 24,000, out of which
they have to pay tax, make debt repayments and provide for operational
drawings.
But the industry is encouraged that international customers are paying as
much as they are for the clip, which is being bolstered by the sale this
season of 150,000 bales from the Wool Board stockpile. So far this season
the board has sold 82,000 bales, leaving its holdings at 476,000 bales,
which it intends to dispose of over the next three years.
The forced sale follows the board's decision last January no longer to
attempt to support the market, and to make an orderly withdrawal. This means
that international buyers must be found for all the wool New Zealand can
produce this season, plus a share of the stockpile. Pessimists believed this
would pose severe price difficulties, especially when the bulk of the
crossbred wool, which makes up about 70 per cent of all New Zealand
production, became available from November. The industry is heartened by the
strong demand, with export sales up 31 per cent in the first half of the
season, although on an annual basis the increase is 17 per cent.
Several unexpected factors boosted demand. One was a substantial drop in the
value of the New Zealand dollar, which has fallen 4 per cent against a trade
weighted basket of currencies from early December, on top of a 10 per cent
devaluation in 1990. This has made quality New Zealand wools
price-competitive against synthetics.
Another factor is a change in shearing patterns. Because of the low returns
many farmers appear to be shearing every 12 months instead of eight months
previously. This is being reflected by smaller than expected offerings at
most recent auctions, forcing buyers to pay more.
Also China has re-entered the market with vigour. Its purchases so far this
season are up 290 per cent. The Chinese are buying for their own
consumption, especially hand knitting wools, which are sold in 500 gram
hanks to peasants who knit cardigans and jerseys for the cold winters.
The Chinese are major buyers of lambs' and medium wools, and prices for
these types have been very firm. However the Wool Board believes that the
Chinese demand may not be sustained, as there are fears that the strong
domestic recovery may falter. So far this season they have bought 25,600
clean tonnes, about a quarter of all exports.
Demand from India for crossbred wool, used in carpet making, which accounts
for the bulk of New Zealand production, picked up sharply this month. This
followed the New Delhi government's decision to waive the 150 per cent
import licence fee for this type of wool in a bid to encourage carpet
exports. The imposition of this tax, originally at 200 per cent, had hit
sales of New Zealand wools to India badly.
Last season India bought 16,000 tonnes of wool, making it New Zealand's
fourth largest customer. In the first six months of this season it bought
only 4,000 tonnes, because of the import fee, but exporters believe the
Indians will continue to buy large quantities over the remainder of the
season as they attempt to rebuild stocks. It is expected that they will buy
a total 12,000 tonnes this season.
An unexpectedly strong demand has come from Nepal, which is finding keen
buyers for its hand-knitted carpets in western Europe, particularly Germany.
Turkey, which is mounting an export drive partly based on machine-made
carpets, has also increased its purchases sharply.
Exports to the Commonwealth of Independent States have been minimal in
recent months because of political and foreign currency problems. In the
early part of the season former Soviet republics bought 4,000 tonnes under a
credit arrangement that is now exhausted.
The Soviet Union for many years was one of New Zealand's biggest wool
customers, but the New Zealand Wool Board's research group manager, Roger
Buchanan says that significant shipments to the CIS are unlikely in the
short term, and the sales of about 27,000 tonnes a year to the former Soviet
territories were a 'thing of the past'.
Wool exports to Belgium rose by 43 per cent and to Germany by 33 per cent,
although the total shipped to Europe this season is expected to be unchanged
because of deep recession in other European Community countries, which
cutting demand for carpets. Exports to the UK, for example, fell 22 per
cent.
The US bought 15 per cent more but Japan 14 per cent less, although both are
expected to increase purchases in the second half of the season.
Wool Board figures show exports for the first half of the season totalled
109,500 clean tonnes, up from 83,600 for the same period last season. The
value of exports rose 9 per cent to NZDollars 538m, up from NZDollars 491m.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada announces fishing cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA IS imposing a partial ban on foreign fishing inside its 200-mile zone
and may restart its controversial offshore seal hunt as part of a package of
measures aimed at reviving the north-west Atlantic cod fishery.
Mr John Crosbie, fisheries minister, yesterday announced a 35 per cent cut
in the 1992 northern cod quota to 120,000 tonnes, including a 50 per cent
reduction in the first half of this year to 25,000 tonnes. He said the
cutback would have the effect of bringing to an immediate end the winter
fishing season for foreign trawlers. He also announced a ban on cod
harvesting by foreign trawlers during future peak spawning periods.
A diplomatic and scientific mission will meet European Commission officials
in Brussels this week to express concern at the continued heavy fishing by
Portuguese and Spanish trawlers outside the 200-mile limit.
The measures, which are expected to lead to further fish-plant closures in
Newfoundland and other Atlantic provinces, follow a sudden drop in fish
stocks in the north-west Atlantic. A Canadian scientific advisory council
recently slashed its estimate of the northern cod stock from 1.1m tonnes to
780,000 tonnes. Stocks of more mature fish - an indicator of spawning
potential - have plummeted by more than half.
The drop in fish stocks is partly blamed on a jump in the east coast seal
population since environmental protests led to a halt in the seal hunt by
large offshore vessels in 1987. Measures to curtail the rise in the seal
population have up to now been discouraged by fears that protests would be
directed against markets for Canadian fish. But Mr Crosbie said yesterday
that the fishing industry is unanimous in its advice that ''notwithstanding
the concern with respect to markets, measures should now be taken to start
bringing the seal population under control'. The government plans to consult
the fishing and sealing industry to determine the best ways of doing this.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC beef exports surge but
stocks still grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community overtook Australia as the world's largest beef
exporter last year, as overseas deliveries surged by nearly a half. But in
spite of the sharp rise in exports, EC beef intervention stocks ended the
year at record levels, according to estimates by the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
In its latest annual report on international meat markets, Gatt says that
only a sharp increase in import demand by the former Soviet Union averted a
big drop in beef prices last year. As it was, prices were sluggish as global
output continued to exceed consumption, a situation exacerbated by large
supplies of poultry, pork and lamb at increasingly competitive prices.
To achieve a sustained firming of beef prices major suppliers will need to
align output to relatively slow growth or even declines in consumption in
the medium term, the report says. Otherwise world beef markets may be faced
with another oversupply crisis in the next few years.
The 27 signatories (including the EC) to Gatt's Arrangement on Bovine Meat,
a voluntary code to promote trade, account for about 90 per cent of world
beef exports and close to 60 per cent of global beef production and
consumption.
Their exports of beef increased by nearly 5 per cent in 1991 to an estimated
4.36m tonnes, carcass weight equivalent. EC beef exports jumped by 48 per
cent to 1.16m tonnes, while Australian shipments, reflecting lower sales to
Japan, fell 15 per cent to 1m tonnes. Brazil and the US also increased beef
exports by 44 per cent and 15 per cent respectively.
The EC's export surge resulted mainly from a 100,000-tonne sale to Brazil
and the sending of an estimated 250,000 tonnes to the Commonwealth of
Independent States. In November 1991, the EC concluded a beef-for-oil barter
deal with the CIS involving 100,000 tonnes of French beef, to be delivered
in 1992.
Soviet beef purchases, accounting for more than 10 per cent of the world
beef trade last year, helped the EC to avoid a surplus crisis. Even so, in
December 1991, EC beef intervention stocks had reached an estimated record
903,000 tonnes.
Another saving factor noted by Gatt was the virtual disappearance last year
of most central and eastern European countries from the beef export scene.
Their beef production has fallen sharply because of the collapse of exports
to the former Soviet market as well as domestic economic and political
upheaval.
Global beef imports rose by about 3.5 per cent in 1991, the report says,
despite lower purchases by Japan and the US. Washington imposed 'voluntary'
export restraint agreements on Australia and New Zealand in November 1991
after a surge of beef imports earlier in the year.
In 1992 Gatt expects world beef exports to shrink by perhaps 1.6 per cent,
as slow economic growth continues to dampen demand in industrialised
countries. It also sees further reductions in meat output, consumption and
trade in eastern Europe over the next two to three years, while the
situation in the CIS 'is, at this stage, unpredictable'. Despite higher
demand in the Middle East and some North African and Asian markets, 'it is
doubtful whether other developing countries will be in a position to import
increased quantities of beef', the report says.
World beef output is expected to decline this year by 0.7 per cent after a
2.5 per cent rise in 1991. In the longer term Gatt notes a trend to slower
growth of cattle herds in an increasing number of countries due to genetic
developments and improved cattle feeding and finishing techniques. These are
likely to result in shorter cattle herd cycles in coming years, the report
says.

competition. Bright liquoring east Africans ruled firm to dearer. Good
mediums were irregular but unchanged on balance while other medium varieties
closed 4-6p higher. Dust grades were again a strong feature and often much
dearer. Offshore: continued good demand with prices firm at last rates and
3-5p up for selected lines. The highest price realised was 168p for a Rwanda
pf. 1. Quotations: quality 150p, good medium 110p, medium 94p, low medium

Gold closed below Dollars 350 a troy ounce on the London bullion market in
lethargic trading dominated by technical factors. The morning fix of Dollars
349 marked a five-month low, but the market recovered a little ground on
bargain hunting and short covering. The April contract on Comex had
recovered by midday from a lifetime low of Dollars 350.20 struck shortly
after the opening. On the LME aluminium rose on the back of the copper
market, but three-month metal met resistance around Dollars 1,340 a tonne.
Dealers are expecting another increase in stocks today. London robusta
coffee prices closed down sharply while New York arabicas well down at
midday after the ICO indicator hit a 17-year low of 54.57 cents a lb. New
York traders said there was little fresh fundamental influence in the market
and prices remained weighed by abundant supply and an absence of strong
demand. May scored a low of 67.20 cents a lb. 'The picture is bleak. There's
a burdensome supply for the near-term and we've got a lot of new crop,' said
one analyst. Robustas have fallen by about Dollars 100 a tonne since
mid-January. 'With the state of the market at the moment we can see it
declining further,' a London dealer said.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa pact talks to start in
April
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD COCOA markets were unimpressed yesterday by the decision of the
International Cocoa Organisation to go ahead with negotiations in Geneva in
April for a new agreement, complete with economic clauses.
The ICCO Council announced late on Friday that it would ask the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development to convene a meeting from April
21 to May 1. However, after a week of talks the ICCO was unable to agree on
the exact form of economic measures a new agreement would employ to support
the market, which has declined to historic lows in real terms since its
buffer stock scheme was frozen in February 1988.
Most of last week the producers were hanging on to the idea of using export
quotas; consumers were adamant that only a withholding scheme should be
considered. The compromise wording of the ICCO statement said that the new
agreement 'should be built upon production policy and supply management.'
A scheme for withholding 120,000 tonnes of cocoa was included in the 1986
cocoa agreement on which any new agreement will be based. However, several
moves to implement the withholding scheme once the ICCO buffer stock reached
the maximum permitted 250,000 tonnes came to naught.
Potential stumbling blocks for a new agreement include the debt of Dollars
145m still owed to the buffer stock by producers, and the fact that the US,
the biggest cocoa consumer, does not belong to the organisation.
Yesterday London's May cocoa contract touched a six-month low of Pounds 684
a tonne in early trading before closing at Pounds 691, down Pounds 1 on the
day.

THE Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa) plans to bring administrative charges
against two brokerages suspected of price manipulation, according to Mr
Alvaro August Vidigal, Bovespa president, Reuter reports from Sao Paulo.
If a Bovespa administrative council rules that the two brokerages, Banco
Garantia and Talarico, are guilty, they could be fined and suspended from
operating in the market for up to 90 days, Mr Vidigal said. 'We already have
enough evidence that these two firms attempted to manipulate the market.'
Mr Vidigal said the exchange would be in charge of the administrative
prosecution, but if the brokerages were found guilty the case could be
passed to police for criminal prosecution.
'If the fraud is confirmed, we will also take the case to the CVM (the
Brazilian Securities Exchange Commission) and to the Public Ministry,' Mr
Vidigal said. If the case were to reach the Public Ministry, directors and
traders from the companies involved might be criminally prosecuted.

FT  25 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: All change for Stockholm
bourse - The proposal to end the exchange's monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S centre-right coalition government has just announced it intends to
abolish the securities trading monopoly held by the Stockholm bourse by the
beginning of next year at the latest.
A draft bill to be presented to parliament proposes the reform of the
existing system of securities trading by allowing the creation of
alternative markets to compete with the traditional stock exchange.
Mr Bo Lundgren, the tax minister responsible for the bourse, said the change
was aimed at improving the functioning of the market by ensuring optimal use
of resources in the reallocation of savings into profitable industrial
investments.
The government plans to make two kinds of authorisation available in Sweden
for trading in securities. The first would be the familiar one for the
operation of the stock exchange. The Stockholm bourse is to be transformed
into a limited liability company and the bourse's members and issuers will
be free to subscribe for shares in the new company.
The second form of authorisation will cover what the Swedish government
calls 'recognised markets'. These would be less regulated and comprehensive
and more flexible than the normal stock exchange and burdened with fewer
legal obligations with an avoidance of cumbersome registration procedures.
Access to the 'recognised markets' will be open not only to those already
eligible for bourse membership but also others not authorised, such as
insurance companies, mutual funds, industrial enterprises and portfolio
managers, as long as they are deemed to have sufficient capital strength and
are considered suitable to operate in trading.
The legislation says each 'recognised market' would determine the conditions
applicable to its trading such as the required amount of shares distributed,
the minimum size of a company and the kind of information obligation
required of the companies listed in the market.
The Stockholm bourse is not opposed in principle to the end of its monopoly
but it does object to any change that might damage its own activities
through losing lucrative business to other markets.
'We strongly support free competition and we are happy to compete but we
want to do so on a level playing field,' explains Mr Leif Vindervag, the
head of research at the bourse. 'What we fear is that the recognised markets
might offer a cheaper way of trading which could cream away many large
companies.
'After all, we have comprehensive obligations to all listed companies, and
must provide a similar service to small as well as large enterprises.'
Mr Lundgren argues the proposed changes are required to adapt Sweden's stock
exchange legislation to international standards and particularly to the
relevant European Community rules, though the Stockholm bourse questions
whether this is the real reason for the reform.
The end of the monopoly is a crucial ingredient in the Swedish government's
wider free market strategy, designed to encourage a greater volume of
securities trading in Sweden and stimulate more liquidity in the market.
Last December a 0.5 per cent turnover tax on share dealing was abolished, a
move that has already brought back trading that went to London and other
foreign markets.
The government recently signalled its intention to end the restricted share
system and ensure that, from next January, all shares are freely available
for purchase by foreigners and Swedes alike, rather than the 30 per cent as
at present.
This spring the first of Sweden's large privatisations will take place and
this is also expected to stimulate considerable bourse interest.
Mr Vindervag estimates that those reforms could improve business turnover on
the Stockholm bourse by more than 50 per cent this year.
The bourse is more worried at the moment about the attractions for trading
in Swedish securities in markets outside Sweden, rather than with any future
competitive challenge within the country's own borders.
Mr Bengt Ryden, the bourse head, plans to visit London next month to bang
the drum for the Stockholm exchange to foreign investors.

FT  25 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Deals at attractive prices whet
investors' appetites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG demand for a Dollars 400m offering for the Republic of Austria and a
Pounds 100m issue of subordinated debt by Abbey National yesterday showed
that, even in rather lacklustre market conditions, investors' appetites can
still be tempted by attractively-priced deals issued by strong credits.
The inventory of unsold paper left over from last month's deluge of
aggressively-priced dollar deals has not yet been cleared, but is being
passed over in favour of attractively priced sovereign paper.
Yield spreads of some top quality paper have continued to narrow. In
particular, the World Bank's Dollars 1.5bn 10-year global issue is now
yielding two basis points less than the comparable US Treasury.
Consequently, Austria's 10-year deal, priced to yield 25 basis points above
the comparable Treasury, appeared attractive, even against deals which have
performed poorly, like Credit Local's 10-year issue currently trading at 27
basis points over the 10-year Treasury.
The recent dip in supply of dollar paper may persist due to the relative
lack of swap opportunities, although demand for paper is improving, as
investors take a more positive view on the dollar.
The Austrian deal had an unusual triple-currency swap structure: the
interest payments are swapped into D-Marks while principal will be repaid in
Swiss francs and yen.
In the sterling sector, Abbey National successfully raised Pounds 100m of
subordinated debt, which will count as lower-tier two under Basle capital
adequacy guidelines. Abbey holds a high proportion of tier one capital, due
to the substantial amount of equity raised when the bank was floated in
1989, but is seeking to build up its tier two capital in order to make more
efficient use of its equity, an official said.
The deal met strong demand, especially from UK fund managers who focused on
the attractive 90 basis point spread for a double A-rated credit, rather
than the subordinated status of the debt.
By the end of the day, the deal was offered at a spread of 88 basis points
above the 10-year gilt. The reception of the issue was not marred by
confusion on Friday, when J. P. Morgan began to syndicate the deal, under
the misapprehension that the mandate had been awarded to Morgan to launch
the deal at a spread of 95 basis points above the gilt.
Dealers said the positive reception also reflected the generally bullish
sentiment pervading the sterling bond market. Continental European as well
as UK demand remained firm as investors focus on the likelihood of lower
interest rates.
'The market is not factoring in the possibility of a Labour victory' in the
forthcoming UK elections, according to one trader. However, swap spreads are
unattractive, so the supply of new issues is likely to be limited. The Abbey
National deal was swapped into floating-rate sterling.
In the Ecu sector, the Council of Europe added an Ecu135m tranche to its
outstanding Ecu365m two-year deal.

<TEXT>
BANK AUSTRIA, formed by the merger Landerbank and Zentralsparkasse last
year, is to take a Sch5bn charge against 1991 earnings because of losses at
Landerbank.
Austria's largest bank said a deficit of at least Sch1bn arose through the
acquisition of Sovereign, a British leasing company, in 1990. The losses are
expected to depress the bank's 1991 partial operating profit by 10 per cent
from Landerbank's and Zentralsparkasse's combined 1990 profit of Sch2.25bn.
Mr Helmut Zilk, Vienna's mayor who also acts as Bank Austria's supervisory
board chairman, said he may initiate legal procedures against some of the
managing board members of former Landerbank.

listing
</HEADLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community is likely to enter into direct negotiations with the
Securities &amp; Exchange Commission - the US securities regulator - over
removing obstacles to the listing of German and other European companies'
shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
The development follows unsuccessful attempts last year by a number of large
German companies to persuade the SEC to moderate its requirement that all
foreign companies wanting to list their shares in the US should comply with
full listing requirements.
The likelihood of EC involvement emerged yesterday after a meeting in
Frankfurt of officials from Germany's stock exchanges, the New York Stock
Exchange, the Bundesbank and German government ministries.
Not a single German company has a listing in the US, chiefly because of an
extreme reluctance to publish figures in line with US Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles as required by the SEC. US accounting rules require
far greater disclosure than the German equivalent and have a tendency to
make reported profits look more generous than in Germany.
German companies, including Daimler-Benz, the big chemicals companies and
some big banks, are believed to have argued with the SEC last year that
their shares ought to be accepted for a listing on a reciprocal basis -
namely that if they have met listing requirements in Germany they ought to
be accepted in the US too.
The arguments carried no weight with the SEC and negotiations stalled.
However, German companies are eager to have access to US equity market -
partly to be able to raise finance there, partly for prestige reasons. The
NYSE for its part is keen to have German companies.
Yesterday's statement from the Federation of German Stock Exchanges said the
question of listing requirements was a problem which had a fundamental
bearing on relations between the US and the whole of Europe, and for that
reason, negotiations should be handled at an EC level.

FT  25 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Most swaps cases settled out
of court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF the legal actions singled out to act as lead cases between banks and
UK local authorities over interest rate swap agreements have been settled
out of court, it was announced yesterday.
Barclays and Midland banks said they had each settled two claims from local
authorities, although the sizes of the settlements were undisclosed.
The High Court determined last July on six lead cases between banks and
local authorities to save the courts from being inundated with claims
relating to the transactions involving 80 banks, 130 councils and some
Dollars 500m.
The cases resulted from the House of Lords ruling early last year that local
authorities were acting outside their powers when entering swap agreements.
This left open to banks only the opportunity to take action for restitution,
to recover sums paid out to authorities under the agreements. These payments
are estimated to amount to only around 20 per cent of banks' total losses.
Barclays said it had settled two restitution claims against Hammersmith and
Fulham, which had been due to come to court in February. The bank, which had
already written off Pounds 41m against local authority swap deals, said its
claim against the authority had been for Pounds 656,000 plus interest, but
refused to disclose the size of the settlement.
Midland has settled two claims against Birmingham City Council. The cases
had been due to start yesterday.
The settlements are believed to be the first since last July, when the lead
cases were decided on. Before that, several banks had reached settlements
with local authorities.
In two of the earlier settlements, Ogwr Borough Council in South Wales paid
Citicorp Investment Bank more than Pounds 1m, and Hammersmith and Fulham
settled with one of the banks involved.
The swaps involved councils exchanging their interest obligations, normally
from fixed to floating rate, in the expectation that rates would fall.

FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: Omron fights to retain
competitive edge - A Japanese company which is sharply cutting capital
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yoshio Tateishi, the president of Omron, the world's largest maker of
switches and relays, sees the current downturn in the Japanese economy as a
harbinger of a decade of slow growth in the country's manufacturing
industry.
But Mr Tateishi is not unduly worried about the prospect. He believes that
even though Omron and other Japanese engineering companies face a more
difficult time in the 1990s, they will retain their competitive edge in
world markets. Growth will come from the further development of the Japanese
economy and from export demand in east Asia.
Omron is anything but immune to the effects of the downturn, which has had a
particularly severe effect on the company's life blood - orders for factory
plant and equipment. Omron warned last week of a likely 54 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits to Y20bn (Dollars 156.3m) in the year to the end of March.
It has cut capital spending from a planned Y70bn to Y50bn this year and
plans further reductions in the year from April. In its concern for falling
profit margins, Omron is reducing its product range by cutting customers'
detailed options.
To make matters worse, independent forecasts for the outlook for capital
spending are universally gloomy - Nippon Credit Bank among others predicts a
decline in investment in the year from April - the first in 15 years.
Nevertheless, Mr Tateishi sees no reason to panic. He believes Omron has
deep-seated commercial and technological advantages which will not be eroded
in even a severe cyclical downturn. He does not share the gloom of some
other Japanese industrialists who have compared the current slowdown with
the recession Japan suffered after the 1974 oil shock.
'The financial bubble of the 1980s has collapsed and capital investment is
falling. A cycle of business expansion has come to an end,' said Mr Tateishi
in a recent interview. 'Up to 1990 sales in our industry grew at an annual
rate of 10 to 15 per cent. I expect annual growth will be 5 to 10 per cent a
year for the rest of the century.'
Japanese companies are scrapping or postponing plans for investment in
increasing capacity. But, says Mr Tateishi, they will continue to invest in
labour-saving equipment, in pollution control, in plant to improve working
conditions and in technological innovation. Moreover, sales to south-east
Asia will grow at more than 10 per cent a year, as the economies in the
region continue expanding faster than the industrialised world.
Omron's fortunes are founded on its leadership in a narrowly-defined but
widely-used technology. Founded in 1948 by Mr Tateishi's father, Mr Kazuma
Tateishi, the company started by supply switches and relays to manufacturing
industry and diversified into sensors, timers and programmable controllers -
all pieces of equipment which link machines in a factory. Its share of the
Japanese market in sensors is 52 per cent, in relays 68 per cent and in
switches 70 per cent.
In recent years it has applied the technology to office automation (modems
and image scanners), medical equipment and banks' automatic teller machines.
But industrial equipment accounts for two-thirds of its turnover which will
total an estimated Y480bn in the year to March.
Mr Tateishi says the company has stayed ahead of rivals through
technological innovation. Employees are encouraged to be innovative and to
foster their 'venture spirit', that is to try new ideas.
The commitment to innovation thrives at Omron's biggest factory at Kusatsu,
near Kyoto, in western Japan, which contains some of the company's most
advanced production made to such accurate specifications that dust would
harm their operation so they are assembled in dust-free 'clean rooms', like
microchips.
Mr Yoshiharu Ukai, a manager, says that 10 years ago the limit for errors in
measurements was 20 to 30 microns. Today it is just 2 microns. In the past,
switches were adjusted after they were made to ensure that they operated at
exactly the right speed. This was now impossible since they were too small.
The products have to be right first time, says Mr Ukai.
The managers at Kusatsu acknowledge that there is no single part of the
manufacturing process which is unique to Omron. The group's edge over its
rivals lies in securing small advantages and making constant improvements.
'There are so many things we can do,' says Mr Ukai, who dreams of the day
Omron will successfully put a relay and a microprocessor in the same silicon
chip.
Mr Tateishi says that this commitment to constant improvements distinguishes
Japanese companies from foreign rivals. 'There is a high level of
consciousness in Japan of the need for technological innovation in
manufacturing.'
Even though Kusatsu is a show-case plant, it has not been spared the effects
of the current slowdown. One out of four lines making relays was shut down
during a recent visit, because, said Mr Ukai, of a 'slight slowing in
orders'.
Mr Tateishi says industry is adjusting to the end of the financial bubble
economy of the late 1980s, in which capital investment was fuelled by a flow
of ultra-cheap credit. Companies, including Omron, face some short-term
difficulties. But in the long-term, Japanese industry will keep investing,
says Mr Tateishi.
'This is a huge market, so I don't think we will run out of work. Rather,
labour shortages are our main problem.'
In the view of industry analysts, Mr Tateishi may be under-estimating the
severity of the present downturn in the Japanese machinery industry. But
they acknowledge that the company's dominant position in its chosen markets,
leaves it well-placed to survive.

ADVERTISING revenue of the New Zealand, Australia and US publications of
Wellington-based Independent Newspapers (INL) was hit by recession, leading
to a 9.7 per cent fall in first-half net profits to NZDollars 16.4m
(USDollars 8.9m).
Mr Alan Burnet, chairman, said the result was satisfactory considering the
depressed economic conditions in the countries where the group owns
newspapers. INL is 51 per cent owned by News Corporation, the media group
controlled by Mr Rupert Murdoch.
Advertising revenues fell 7.1 per cent in New Zealand and 10.7 per cent in
Australia compared with the same period of 1990.
Mr Burnet said the group experienced some recovery, especially in its South
Island New Zealand newspapers. Interest costs would fall for the year after
NZDollars 14.24m of debt was repaid.
The closure of the loss-making Auckland Star during the period, plus static
newspaper prices was expected to mean that the full-year result would show
considerable improvement. Satisfactory results were achieved by Gordon and
Gotch, the subsidiary which is the largest newspaper and magazine
distributor in Australasia.
Circulation of the paid newspapers had been stable, with the Christchurch
Press and the Waikato Times showing significant gains. Sales rose 14.9 per
cent to NZDollars 471.39m from NZDollars 410.3m.
Pre-tax profits fell 8.6 per cent to NZDollars 26.11m. Tax took NZDollars
9.83m against NZDollars 10.37m. A maintained 7 cents a share dividend was
declared.

The company, which assembles most of its motors in other Asian countries,
lifted sales for the year 15.3 per cent to Y69.6bn, with demand strong for
both its completed motors and motor parts. Overseas production bases enabled
it to avoid the cost increases experienced by other Japanese exporters
because of last year's appreciation of the yen.

TWO leading Japanese pharmaceuticals groups reported increased
non-consolidated earnings for the year to December. Both companies saw rises
in sales and profits from the previous year due to new drug developments.
Chugai Pharmaceutical's pre-tax profits rose 11.9 per cent to Y10.5bn
(Dollars 81.6m) after a sluggish performance in the previous year, as
profits fell sharply in 1990 due to a slump in sales of the group's
anti-cancer agents. While sales of its mainstay drugs remain subdued,
Chugai's remedy for renal anemia helped push sales of blood and body fluids
up 69 per cent to Y22.8bn.
For the full year to December, Chugai expects a 13.2 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Y12bn on an 8.8 per cent rise in sales to Y145bn.
Green Cross, the plasma derivatives maker which was found importing
uncertified blood products in 1988, saw pre-tax profits rise 4.6 per cent to
Y4.7bn on a 5.8 per cent increase in sales to Y77bn. Net profits rose 69.5
per cent to Y2.2bn.
The company's profits were squeezed the previous year due to sluggish demand
for its blood preparations.
For the current year, Green Cross expects pre-tax profits to remain flat at
Y4.8bn on a 3.9 per cent rise in sales to Y80bn.

HEAVY writedowns pushed Petro-Canada, the partially-privatised Canadian
energy group, to a record CDollars 598m (USDollars 502.5m) loss in its first
year as a publicly-traded company.
The Calgary-based group suffered an operating loss last year of CDollars
143m, compared with earnings of CDollars 176m in 1990. However, the 1991
bottom line was further dented by writedowns totalling CDollars 455m.
The writedowns stem mainly from the restructuring of the fuel products
division, including the planned closure of about 1,000 service stations.
Petro-Canada also cut the carrying value of its shareholding in Syncrude,
the oilsands plant in northern Alberta, by CDollars 95m after tax. Cash-flow
slumped to CDollars 292m from CDollars 621m.
The bulk of the operating loss was suffered by the products division, mainly
because of an inability to recover the high cost of crude oil held in
inventory at the beginning of the year. The problem was exacerbated by weak
demand and fiercely competitive pricing.
The federal government sold 20 per cent of its stake in Petrocan to the
public last July. The shares have been trading at CDollars 10.13,
substantially below the CDollars 13 issue price.

takes new twist

THE SEARCH for a successor to Mr Lee Iacocca as chairman of Chrysler took an
unexpected twist yesterday when Mr Steve Miller, vice-chairman and one of
several candidates for the top job, announced he was leaving the automobile
company.
Mr Miller, 50, is to join the small but distinguished New York investment
bank of James D. Wolfensohn as a senior partner. The firm's other seven
partners include the eponymous Mr Wolfensohn and Mr Paul Volcker, former
chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Mr Iacocca, who is to retire at the end of 1992, said Mr Miller was one of
several candidates under consideration for his job.
However, industry analysts had not viewed Mr Miller as a particular
favourite for the post since his expertise is mainly on the financial side,
rather than in making cars.
The other main internal candidate is thought to be Mr Robert Lutz, the
president of the company and head of its automobile manufacturing
operations, although there have been reports of friction between him and Mr
Iacocca.
This has led to speculation that the company may look outside for a
successor, perhaps considering Mr Gerald Greenwald, who was favourite to
succeed Mr Iacocca before leaving Chrysler in 1990.
He is now a managing director of Dillon, Read, the Wall Street investment
bank. Mr Miller became chief financial officer of Chrysler in 1981 - in the
midst of its brush with bankruptcy - and worked with Mr Wolfensohn and Mr
Volcker during the company's financial restructuring.
He said yesterday: 'It was not an easy decision to leave Chrysler. But the
essential work to position the company for the 1990s has been completed: a
new array of products, a lean cost structure, and a revitalised balance
sheet. I felt it was time for a new challenge.'
Chrysler, like other car manufacturers, has been facing a severe financial
squeeze because of the US recession and is banking on new product
introductions later this year to solidify its market share. It has yet to
name a replacement for Mr Miller.

THE RELENTLESS refinancing at RJR Nabsico, the US tobacco and food group
which was the subject of a record Dollars 25bn leveraged buy-out in 1989,
continued yesterday when the company bought in Dollars 1bn worth of
debenture stock, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
Funds to finance the purchase of the debenture stock came from RJR's
newly-negotiated bank facilities. Essentially, the company is replacing the
high-cost debenture debt with cheaper bank loans.
Last year, the company shed its 'highly leveraged transaction' status. This
is a technical banking definition, but by moving out of this category, RJR
was able to win access to more attractive bank funds.
The purchase of debenture stock covers Dollars 750m principal of
subordinated discount debentures due 2001, Dollars 165m principal of 15 per
cent payment-in-kind subordinated debentures due 2001, and Dollars 85m
principal of 13.5 per cent subordinated debentures due 2001.

<TEXT>
BANK of America plans to sell 183 branches and divest itself of Dollars
7.3bn of deposits in five states in order to meet anti-trust concerns over
the forthcoming Dollars 4.5bn merger with Security Pacific.
The planned divestitures, which are in line with previous indications, are
designed to conform to guidelines that the bank has discussed with federal
and state bank regulators as well as the Department of Justice.
Some 10,000 employees are expected to be made redundant as part of the
merger of the two banks, which have a combined pre-merger workforce of
91,400.
Mr John Wilson, chief economist of Bank of America, told a Senate
sub-committee yesterday that the planned divestitures would reduce the
post-merger deposit concentration of the combined bank to less than 30 per
cent of total deposits of commercial banks, mutual savings banks, savings
institutions and credit unions in the five states - California, Washington,
Arizona, Oregon and Nevada.
The merger, which is expected to go ahead in the next few weeks, has run
into problems in Washington and Arizona, where state legislative panels have
proposed laws that would limit to 30 per cent the total deposits the Bank of
America-Security Pacific group could hold.
Bank of America argued yesterday that following the sale of 69 branches and
Dollars 2.5bn of deposits in Washington, its share of total deposits in the
state would be 26.1 per cent. The level in Arizona would be 24.8 per cent
after the divestiture of 45 branches and Dollars 2.2bn of deposits in the
state.
The planned merger will create the largest banking group on the west coast
and the second biggest US bank in asset terms, with about Dollars 185bn of
assets. The combined branch network, prior to the divestiture of 183
branches, would be 2,332.

A LEADING family shareholder of Exor, the French holding group which
controls Perrier, yesterday rejected a FFr6bn (Dollars 1.07bn) counter-bid
from BSN, the food group.
Mrs Corinne Mentzelopoulos, of the Franco-Greek family which made a fortune
from the Felix Potin grocery chain, announced she would not tender her Exor
shares to BSN's offer, made last Friday.
Mrs Mentzelopoulos owns just over 14 per cent of Exor and is allied with
Ifint, the Agnelli family holding company which has made an agreed bid for
Exor and holds another 39.84 per cent of the shares.
Separately, Nestle, the Swiss food group, is making a hostile bid for
Perrier itself.
The announcement confirms that BSN's bid for Exor has no chance of success,
a fact which comes as no surprise to any of the parties in the convoluted
three-month battle.
BSN has made clear that the real purpose of its bid is to put pressure on
the Agnellis to negotiate a solution, in which BSN would take over Volvic,
one of Perrier's brands; Nestle would take the rest of Perrier; and in which
the Agnellis would be offered a dignified and profitable exit.

CREDITANSTALT, Austria's second largest bank, is taking a major stake in a
Slovenian bank, its first significant foothold in the region.
Creditanstalt's chairman, Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, said the bank wanted to
buy at least 55 per cent in Ljubljana-based Nova Banka. Slovenian press
reports said the deal would be worth Ecu37.8m (Dollars 30.7m).
Creditanstalt's acquisition of Nova Banka is the first investment of a
foreign bank in Slovenia since the republic broke away from Yugoslavia last
summer. The move highlights Slovenia's growing dependence on Austria for
economic and financial support. The country has a population of only 2m and
few monetary reserves to back its new currency.
Mr Schmidt-Chiari said the transaction was part of his bank's strategy to
expand in the former communist countries bordering Austria. It already
operates branches or joint ventures in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland.
Two-year-old Nova Banka is one of Slovenia's leading experts in foreign
trade financing. The bank, with assets of about Ecu15m and 50 employees, was
the first in Slovenia to issue shares to the public.
Creditanstalt said it would buy the interest by financing an increase in
paid-in capital.

<TEXT>
RENOWN, the leading Japanese clothing-maker which recently acquired
Aquascutum of the UK, reported a pre-tax loss of Y8.2bn (Dollars 64.06m) for
the year to end-December, compared with a profit of Y6.3bn in the previous
term. It blamed the downturn on inclement weather and a weak stock market.
The company, which was counting on an upturn in Japanese stock prices to
help cover the Aquascutum purchase, made in August 1990, now hopes a
marketing campaign for the brand will help lift its sales later this year.
Overall sales last year fell 1.5 per cent to Y228.18bn, with declines in
most clothing lines, including a 4.5 per cent fall in outerwear and a 10.9
per cent decrease in baby wear.
Renown said clothing sales in Japan generally had been affected by a series
of typhoons during the summer and an unusually warm winter.
The company, which had a reputation for its success at zaitech, or financial
engineering, reported a loss of Y237m on the cancellation of its tokkin, or
specified money trusts. The value of these trusts was eroded by the weak
Tokyo stock prices over the past year.
Renown also reported an appraisal loss of Y10.42bn on securities holdings,
but it recorded a Y29.79bn profit on property sales during the period.
In the past, many Japanese companies have relied on playing the stock market
to improve profits and raise funds for capital expenditure.
However, companies that invested heavily in stocks during the late 1980s are
now tempted to realise losses in expectation of enduring weakness in the
Tokyo market.
Renown is hoping a marketing campaign to lift the profile of Aquascutum
products will result in healthier sales in Japan. Instead of relying on its
regular sales staff, the company will send sales managers to retail stores
to encourage the shops to stock the brand.

ROUSSEL-UCLAF, the French pharmaceutical company owned by Hoechst of
Germany, has reported 1991 net profits little changed at FFr598m (Dollars
106.78m).
Originally Roussel, in which Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals group,
retains a minority stake, had expected profits to fall by about 8 per cent.
However, the final quarter was more buoyant than anticipated, and the group
managed to produce a slight increase in profits from the FFr597m in 1990.
Roussel's turnover rose 9.9 per cent to FFr14.3bn in 1991, from FFr13bn the
previous year. The company benefited from the introduction of several
'winter' products - for flu and chest problems - towards the end of 1990.
The fastest growing area of Roussel last year was the small chemicals
division, which saw sales increase by 25 per cent. Pharmaceuticals mustered
more modest growth of 9.2 per cent, and agri-veterinary products were ahead
7.1 per cent.
Roussel made provisions of FFr150m during the year to pay for the
restructuring of its operations. The group closed a number of production
plants in Europe, and also consolidated part of its French interests on one
site at Romainville in Seine-Saint-Denis.

FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: Calmly observing a share price
slide - Telefonica's feelings on investor nervousness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a company that saw some 12 per cent of its stock market value vaporise
in heavy selling in Madrid and New York during three days last week,
Telefonica, Spain's state-controlled telecommunications monopoly, is a model
of corporate serenity.
Investors had reacted badly to the announcement that the transfer of
Telefonica's in-house pension scheme to the national social security system
was going to cost the group Pta19.4bn (Dollars 194m) this year.
But, says an official, 'that was natural. We can easily make up that amount,
but any market learning that a company is going to incur extra costs of
Dollars 190m is going to react badly'.
The news knocked Pta140 off Telefonica's shares in Madrid, although by
yesterday the share price had begun to recover slowly. With cash-flow
running at around Pta450bn a year, a one-off addition to Telefonica's costs
of Pta19.4bn is clearly not the end of the world.
Nevertheless, the company may have got itself into an uncomfortable
position, particularly among foreign investors. The pension fund move was
the latest in a series of irritations which began last summer when Mr
Candido Velazquez, Telefonica's chairman, sparked a sharp increase in the
company's share price by announcing it had decided to begin linking
dividends to profits. This brought to an end the tradition by which the
company paid a dividend of 11 per cent over the stock's nominal value.
The stock market took this to imply an almost certain 1991 dividend
increase. But while the company did, indeed, report a 6.7 per cent rise in
net profits to Pta80bn for the year, the dividend did not move.
Investors in Madrid and New York were plainly disappointed. The added impact
of the pension fund move - which has been hanging over the company for some
time - has not helped. Basically, Telefonica is having to transfer its
underfunded pensions scheme to the social security system and borrow Pta55bn
from the system to pay back the difference.
The Pta55bn, however, applies only to retirees already drawing pensions. An
estimated Pta135bn will be owed to active workers over the next 25 years,
which could cost the company about 1 per cent a year in interest to the
social security.
And because Telefonica's own scheme promises workers a premium over the
social security, the company may have to create an additional external
scheme worth an estimated Pta75bn and finance it through borrowings.
Nevertheless, the timing of Telefonica's pensions announcement may be
political. The Spanish state's 32 per cent shareholding in the company
ensures Telefonica a sympathetic ear as it begins negotiations with the
government on 1992 tariff increases. Last year it won an average 6.7 per
cent. Even a 5 per cent rise this year could generate an extra Pta40bn in
income.
Telefonica will also install 500,000 new lines this year, and is still
negotiating the disposal, forced upon it by the European Commission
following the merger last year of Alcatel and Telettra, of stakes in Alcatel
and Telettra's Spanish operations. These represent Telefonica's biggest
industrial shareholdings.
Along with management determination to find new savings and extra
productivity this year to compensate for the pension transfer costs, income
from these asset sales should comfortably see Telefonica over the
difficulties that emerged last week.

FT  25 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 45.5m flotation for CSI's building
side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANNON STREET Investments yesterday announced the Pounds 45.5m flotation of
its Avonside building arm in a move which will halve its borrowings.
The mini-conglomerate, valued at less than Pounds 30m after its shares
collapsed last year following a profits warning, will receive all of the
flotation proceeds. The money is being raised half by the placing of shares,
completed yesterday, and half from the offer for sale of shares to the
public at 106p.
Mr Robin Binks, chief executive, said: 'The sale will enable us to produce a
better balance sheet. While we will still have gearing of about 100 per
cent, it will be against a conservative and prudently stated balance sheet.'
CSI last month had borrowings of Pounds 97m.
Although the group's shares rose 4p to close at 26p yesterday, commentators
questioned the wisdom of selling a housebuilding company at a time when the
property market was experiencing one its worst downturns.
Mr Robert Donald, an analyst at County NatWest, said: 'For any company to
float a housebuilding business this side of the election must either be
bearish about housing post-election or very keen for cash. This is not the
best time to sell this type of business.'
Mr Christopher Glynn, non-executive chairman of Avonside, concurred that it
was a bad time to sell a housebuilding business but a great time to buy. 'If
it was not for the blow-out we have had in the sector, we would not have to
float at this price.'
Avonside, which has been profitable over the past five years, operates in
the north of England, North Wales and Scotland. Mr Glynn said that unit
sales and house prices in these areas were expected to remain static,
although he had glimpsed evidence of a slight upturn, particularly in North
Wales.
Three quarters of Avonside's land was surveyed before the decision to float.
In the light of the valuation Mr Glynn said that the group was confident
that there would be no need for any write-down in the value of its land.
In 1991 Avonside's turnover increased to Pounds 51.2m (Pounds 45.7m) while
profits before tax and exceptionals were Pounds 8m (Pounds 7.9m). Only one
third of the sales were related to housebuilding; the rest came from
building services such as plumbing and heating.
The pro forma balance sheet for last year shows net assets of Pounds 21.4m
and net cash.

FT  25 FEB 92 / UK Company News: The man from Del Monte, he say 'Float my
fruit' - Roland Rudd talks to Leon Allen about his planned Pounds 450m
flotation of the canned food company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEL MONTE is about to be floated on the London Stock Exchange. The question
is, which Del Monte? Five different companies use the brand name.
The one in question is Del Monte Foods International, which is preparing for
a Pounds 450m flotation.
Mr Leon Allen, chairman, says brand recognition is so high in Europe that
whenever he goes through passport control customs officials cannot resist
the quip: 'So you're the man from Del Monte'.
As it happens, he is. The four other Del Monte companies are not. But the
retail investor, who will be asked to stump up for shares in Del Monte
Foods, could be forgiven for being a little confused.
So first the history.
In February 1989 RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco group which
exclusively owned the Del Monte name, was bought by the US buy-out
specialists, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for Dollars 25bn (Pounds 14.2bn).
KKR broke up Del Monte into two parts: fresh fruit and produce.
It sold the fresh fruit to Polly Peck International in September 1989 for
Dollars 875m.
And in January 1990 it sold Del Monte's produce business to a private US
consortium led by Merrill Lynch for Dollars 1.54bn. The US consortium named
its Del Monte business the Del Monte Corporation.
What followed can only be described as the proliferation of the Del Monte
name. Since the Merrill Lynch-led consortium had mainly financed its
acquisition through debt it was keen to divest itself of much of its
newly-acquired business.
The Del Monte Corporation immediately sold the rights to its name in the Far
East to Kikkoman Corporation of Japan for Dollars 110m.
In March 1990 DMC sold the Hawaiian Punch fruit drinks brand to Proctor and
Gamble for Dollars 150m - but without giving the man from Del Monte another
corporate face. Proctor and Gamble was only interested in the Hawaiian Punch
and did not want the Del Monte brand name to market the fruit drinks.
DMC's European juice and tinned fruit business was next to go, as a
management buy-out backed by Charterhouse, the UK merchant bank, for Dollars
375m in May 1990.
It is this company which is about to be floated on the London Stock
Exchange, and which has exclusive rights to the man from Del Monte dressed
in his cream suit and panama hat.
Mr Allen's Del Monte Foods International has expanded throughout Europe and
developed a worldwide business which operates in 35 countries.
A joint venture between DMFI, DMC and Kikkoman's Del Monte Far East gave
life to one last Del Monte company called Del Monte's Philippines Inc
(DMPI).
But the only confusion Mr Allen has been concerned about is between his
company and Polly Peck International's Del Monte fresh fruit.
Last year DMFI took full page adverts in national newspapers under the
slogan: 'The man from Del Monte he say Oi.' The message was that the man
from Del Monte, producing 'delicious canned fruit', was fed up with being
confused with Polly Peck's fresh fruit business.
He could get angry again if the Polly Peck administrators realise their
ambition of floating the fresh fruit businesses in the US later this year.
Del Monte Corporation in the US was sufficiently irritated by what it saw as
Polly Peck International's attempts to make the confusion worse that last
year to sue PPI Del Monte Tropical Fruit Company for breach of contract,
unfair competition and infringement of Del Monte's trademark rights.
Mr Allen has never threatened such drastic action.
But he has to contend with the possibility that a mistake by any of the
companies using the Del Monte name could harm his brand in Europe - though
he believes the threat of such contagion is small, given that the various
Del Monte companies operate in different geographical markets. 'I do not
believe there is much of a danger that we will be affected by what Del Monte
does in the US' he says.
But he nonetheless regards the Del Monte brand as his company's most
valuable asset. He led the buy-out for the reason that 'properties like the
Del Monte brand' do not become available very often.
He cites the results of the company's market research: when a sample of
consumers in the UK, Belgium. the Netherlands and Switzerland were asked to
list any food brand names they could think of, three quarters mentioned Del
Monte, a very high recognition rate. More than half of those polled in
DMFI's other main European countries recognised its brand name.
The brand strength is sustained by unusually high expenditure on television
advertising and marketing. Marketing costs were Pounds 9m in 1989, the year
before the buy-out, and have risen to Pounds 24m this year.
As a result, DMFI is the number one or two leading canned fruit and beverage
brand in 12 European countries. About 90 per cent of its goods are market
leaders.
'We believe our track record speaks for itself. We have a story to tell that
investors are going to understand.'
The strategy appears to have paid dividends. While other big buy-outs of the
last few years have struggled to hit their financial targets, DMFI's profits
have risen rapidly. In the year to November 1991, its pre-tax profits rose
24 per cent to Pounds 36.5m.
The company is not making any forecast for the year ending November 1992.
But it is likely to exceed 1991's profits, which is why Mr Allen is hopeful
that while there might be more than one company with his brand name, retail

Hewitt Group, a manufacturer of industrial ceramics and refractories, lifted

1991.
Continued enhancement of profit margins - ahead from 9.3 to 9.9 per cent -
was achieved against a backdrop of severe price cutting in all markets.
Turnover fell from Pounds 8m to Pounds 7.41m.
Earnings per share were 11.4p (10.9p) and the dividend is again 2.5p, with a
1.5p final.

<TEXT>
MR YAACOV Nimrodi, an Israeli arms dealer, has bought Maariv, Israel's
second largest daily newspaper, from Arthur Andersen, administrator of the
late Mr Robert Maxwell's assets in Israel.
Mr Nimrodi fought off competition from Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian press
magnate who was the other serious contender for the paper.
Mr Black's Hollinger group, whose holdings include the Daily Telegraph and
the Australian Fairfax newspaper chain, already owns the Jerusalem Post,
Israel's English-language daily.
The offer is being made through Israel Land Development, in which Mr Nimrodi
holds a majority stake. It has signed an agreement to buy 87 per cent of the
Maariv Modiin Publishing House for Dollars 14.5m (Pounds 8.2m).
The offer is being made in tandem with Mr Shimon Cheifetz, Maariv's managing
director, who already has 8 per cent of the company's shares. Aside from the
newspaper, Maariv Modiin's subsidiaries include a video company, a printing
house, a woman's magazine and cable television.
Mr Nimrodi's son, Ofer, managing-director of Israel Land Development, said
the newspaper's editorial board would continue to enjoy 'absolute
independence and freedom of the press'.
Maariv Modiin is understood to carry debt of about Dollars 30m and is said
to require a capital injection in addition to the buying price. A survey
published this week by the Israel Advertisers Association showed that
Maariv's circulation had declined in 1991.
Mr Maxwell was the first foreigner to buy an Israeli newspaper. His plans
for Maariv to capture part of the market held by Yediot Aharonot, Israel's
largest daily, were never fulfilled.

A dispute has arisen over whether Mirror Group Newspapers has paid all the
rent due on its Holborn headquarters, the High Court heard yesterday, writes
Raymond Hughes.
Mr Jeffery Onions, counsel for the administrative receivers of Robert
Maxwell Estates, co-lessor of the Mirror building and other properties
leased to Maxwell Communication Corporation, said some but not all of the
rent due had been paid after service earlier this month of a notice under
the 1908 Law of Distress Amendment Act.
The next quarterly rent was due on March 24. If payment was not received RME
would return to court to seek leave to start proceedings for possession of
the Mirror building.

The news-stand consumer magazines range from Wedding and Home and Practical
Householders to The Gardener and Rock Power.
Mr Martin Makey of ECI will be chairman of HHL and Mr Terry Humphreys will
be chief executive. Mr Humphreys said yesterday that by completing the
buy-out the team had been able to protect creditors, clients, readers and
staff. The staff numbers about 300.
Bids, including an MBO, are now being considered for Maxwell Business

FT  25 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Banks take 9.9% stake in Aitch restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AITCH HOLDINGS, the clothing manufacturer and importer, has agreed a
financial restructuring with its bankers and new loans from the Industrial
Development Board for Northern Ireland.
Reporting a Pounds 6.9m pre-tax loss in the year to November 30, Mr Michael
Green, chief executive, said the group was 'viable going forward' as a
result of the restructuring and the repositioning of the shirts business in
Northern Ireland.
The restructuring leaves the new board and the group's bankers with nearly
17 per cent and 9.9 per cent respectively of the company.
Cahoots, a menswear importer, has been sold for Pounds 247,000 cash. Mr
Harry Rogers, who reversed Aitch into Munton Group in 1988, has left the
board and paid Pounds 681,000 for Naughty Clothing, which designs, sources
and imports ladies clothes.
In the year to November 30 they incurred a loss after all charges of Pounds
1.2m. Aitch said that the sales would release the substantial working
capital.
The group will concentrate on developing its shirt and ladies leisurewear
businesses.
Some Pounds 5.3m of the group's overdraft has been converted into a
three-year loan and the IDB of Northern Ireland has put up Pounds 500,000 of
new money.
The group made an Pounds 8.87m write-off of goodwill as part of a Pounds
10.16m extraordinary charge. As a result, the company will be seeking a
reduction of capital.
Turnover for the year was Pounds 36.5m, of which Pounds 19.7m related to
continuing activities generating a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.08m. Total
losses per share were 10.03p.

FT  25 FEB 92 / UK Company News: European side limits fall at Low &amp; Bonar to
4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW &amp; BONAR yesterday announced a slight fall in profits and a maintained
dividend, as UK and North American operations were affected by recession.
The Dundee-based packaging and plastics company reported a 4 per cent fall
in pre-tax profits to Pounds 24.3m for the year to November 30.
Turnover dipped to Pounds 307.7m (Pounds 310.9m).
Mr Roland Jarvis, managing director, said that most divisions performed well
in the second half. Cost-cutting, still underway, and investment in capacity
should allow 'reasonable' profits growth this year, he said.
Operations in continental Europe, started in 1985, lifted profits and
margins. The Continent accounted for 32 per cent of total operating profits,
up from 27.8 per cent last time. European margins improved to 11.2 per cent
(10.8 per cent) and both Germany and Belgium remained strong.
Directors are recommending a final dividend of 6.4p for an unchanged total
of 9.1p.
Earnings per share fell to 18.82p (19.71p), partly reflecting a higher tax
charge.
In the UK, operating profits from packaging fell slightly to Pounds 7.5m
(Pounds 7.9m), due to declines in the retail bag market. But specialist
materials, which includes Flotex floor coverings, maintained operating
profits at Pounds 3.7m.
The company is looking at three acquisitions on the Continent.
Net borrowings have fallen to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 14.3m) while gearing has
dropped to 10.2 per cent.
The shares yesterday rose 8p to 259p.
COMMENT
These are respectable figures from Low &amp; Bonar, which is coping with
recession through cost-cutting and improved margins. The company's forecast
of a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax profits this year assumes no increase
in sales, which augurs well for when the economic upturn arrives in the US
and the UK. But after rising nearly 30 per cent in the last 12 months,
partly in sympathy with the rest of the sector, the shares are no longer
cheap. James Capel, the stockbroker, has increased its forecast for this
year to Pounds 26.5m pre-tax, putting the shares on a prospective multiple
of 12.8. Given the company's history of false dawns, investors would be
forgiven for waiting for another set of results before giving it the
re-rating it believes it deserves.

FT  25 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Principal Hotels goes into administration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRINCIPAL Hotels Group, the shares of which were suspended last Friday while
the company's financial position was clarified, went into administrative
receivership last night with borrowings of more than Pounds 100m.
The Harrogate-based group has 19 hotels in Britain, two each Denmark and the
Netherlands and one in France. Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountants,
will carry on running the group to try and sell it. About 1,000 jobs are
involved.
Mr Edward Klempka, a partner in Coopers' Leeds office, said: 'The hotels are
viable. We will continue to expand until they can be sold.' A management
buy-out, trade sale or even reflotation are possible options.
Hotels include the Norbreck Castle in Blackpool, the Palace in Copenhagen
and the Douglas in Aberdeen. The group was formed in 1988 as a hotels and
financial services operation, but sold the latter in 1989. It borrowed
heavily to refurbish old hotels on prominent sites and became over-geared.
The recession hit bookings and the vital conference trade, pushing losses
for the 16 months to last October to more than Pounds 10m. In January,
Principal postponed interest payments on its 11 per cent convertible
unsecured loan stock pending restructuring.

FT  25 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Unlicensed but determined to thrill -
Thames TV is planning its new future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN five months after the fateful fax that ended Thames Television's
life within the ITV network the future of the company is beginning to take
shape.
Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames, outbid by Carlton Communications
in the competitive tenders for new franchises, estimates that the new Thames
will employ 235 people. That compares with an historic high of 2,600 and a
total of 1,400 at the end of last year.
The phased pattern of redundancies is continuing and by the time Thames
hands over to Carlton Television at the end of this year what was the
largest ITV company will have shrunk to having fewer than 500 staff.
'One thousand two hundred men and women are losing their livelihoods on a
poker play. Long-established and experienced teams are being broken up for
ever,' was how Mr Dunn described the process last week at a Financial Times
conference. It was the first time the Thames chief executive had spoken
publicly since the day the franchise was lost.
As people leave and departments are closed, or reduced to a skeleton staff,
Thames has also cut its output of regional programming to the minimum
allowed and been given a substantial cut by the rest of ITV in this year's
network expenditure.
For staff every day brings a new 'salami' cut in services. Yesterday's memo
was about a reduction in the department that deals with viewer
correspondence.
The in-house music library has closed and the newspaper cuttings department
now only cuts the tabloid newspapers not the broadsheets.
'We expect to be strongly cash positive in 1992 and 1993 as the cost base
reduces radically, working capital unwinds and asset disposals are made,'
said Mr Dunn, adding that the interests of shareholders would come first.
The company is 58-per cent owned by Thorn EMI, the music and rentals group.
Although a wide range of options for the future are still being considered
the preferred route forward is as an independent producer selling programmes
to the ITV network, while remaining a publicly quoted company.
An ITV sub-committee, which includes Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive of London
Weekend Television and chairman of the ITV Association, is negotiating to
buy Thames programmes. The package being talked about includes programmes
such as The Bill, This Is Your Life, Minder, Strike It Lucky, Des O'Connor
and Wish You Were Here?
The negotiations are centring on price and the length of contract. Thames is
trying to hold out for two-year deals.
Thames is also discussing a number of new programme ideas with the BBC and
drawing up plans to exploit a 10,000 programme library.
It is also looking for 15 per cent stakes in a number of ITV companies or
competing channels to help to build up secondary markets for its programmes.
Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act 15 per cent investments are the maximum
allowed to independents if they want to retain access to the 25 per cent
quota set aside for independent production on UK television.
Only if the independent production route is blocked is Thames likely to dust
down Plan B - using the Astra satellite system to launch a 24-hours a day
channel as early as the end of this year.
Another possibility is taking part in a bid for the new Channel 5 and also
broadcasting the channel on satellite. But Mr Dunn is still extremely
cautious about Channel 5.
'I still find it difficult to decide whether it is an opportunity or a
threat' is how he described it.
The Dunn blueprint envisages a UK production staff for Thames, including its
Euston Films subsidiary, of only 40 by the middle of next year. A further 35
will work in international programme distribution. Together they will make
up the core of the new business.
Some 50 staff are expected to survive, after 80 redundancies at Cosgrove
Hall, the Thames cartoon production company now making a Noddy cartoon
series for the BBC.
In the US there will be 50 jobs at Reeves Entertainment, the American
acquisition.
'With production based in London, New York and Hollywood we aim to be a
natural highway for co-production finance, especially between the United
States and Europe,' Mr Dunn hoped. The Thames group management to look after
investments in SES, the Astra satellite company, Independent Television
News, Oracle, the teletext company and Childrens Channel will number less
than 20.
A further 40 will service Teddington Studios which will offer its facilities
to both the independent production sector and the BBC.
'It will either market its services successfully enough to recover its costs
or this aspect of our operations will close,' warned Mr Dunn.
The same could probably said of all of Thames operations after 1993 in the
harsh world of commercial television without a broadcasting licence.

The Merseyside fraud squad is investigating Alan Paul, the hairdressing and

Papers are being evaluated by the Crown Prosecution Service, but police have
refused to discuss details of the investigation. Questions were raised ahead
of the receivership about Alan Paul's financing arrangements for its
franchises. Franchisees also claimed their accounts were mismanaged.
Alan Paul was a high profile company which claimed to be recession proof
when it came to the USM in 1989. It was hit by a failed rights issue,
profits warnings and boardroom rows.

of future profits.
Earnings per share increased by 14 per cent to 53.1 cents. An increased

FT  25 FEB 92 / Steetley in court action on Gobitta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEETLEY, the UK building materials group fighting a Pounds 600m hostile
bid, is taking legal action against the Gobitta family which in 1990 sold
its Paris aggregates business to Steetley for Pounds 92m.
The valuation of the Gobitta business has been raised as a key issue in
Steetley's defence against the bid from Redland, a rival British group.
Mr Richard Miles, Steetley's chief executive, said last night that action
against the Gobitta family was over warranties and guarantees affecting
options to acquire land acquired by Steetley as part of the purchase.
He said that Steetley wanted further information about who owned the title
to some of these sites. He said: 'It would appear that some of the land
thought to have been in the original contract may not be there.'
Mr Miles stressed that Steetley generally had been pleased with the purchase
of Gobitta which had given the British group a base in the important Paris
market. He said that so far the group had paid only half the purchase price.
The next instalment was not due until this summer.
He said Steetley would provide a full valuation of all its businesses at the
appropriate time.
News of the legal action over Gobitta was disclosed yesterday by Redland
which said that it had obtained a copy of a letter sent to British
solicitors Linklaters and Paines by Mr Jean-Francois Gohier, legal manager
of Garon, the Steetley subsidiary in France which carried out the Gobitta
deal.
The letter sent on January 28 this year accompanied copies of annexes to the
Gobitta purchase agreement which had been requested by the British Takeover
Panel. It refers to claims against the family over guarantee agreements but
does not give details of the claims.
Redland previously has said that the Pounds 92m price paid by Steetley for
Gobitta substantially over-valued the business.
It says that at the time of the acquisition Gobitta had received planning
permission to extract only about 40m tonnes of the 150m tonnes of sand,
gravel and limestone reserves it controlled.
According to Redland, this had not been revealed to British analysts when
the purchase was announced. Steetley said that full details were available
in the French contract but that there had been 'an error of translation'
which omitted these details in the British version.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE VALUE of listed invest-ments owned by Olympia &amp; York, the property
developer owned by Canada's Reichmann family, has tumbled by 44 per cent in
the past two years, according to estimates by Dominion Bond Rating Service
of Toronto.
DBRS cites the drop in share values as one of several concerns about O&amp;Y's
creditworthiness. Others include the slump in the North American property
market, the financial problems of London's Canary Wharf, which is being
developed by O&amp;Y, and the general difficulty of obtaining bank financing for
projects.
The rating agency said in reports published yesterday it had lowered the
credit ratings on several securities guaranteed by O&amp;Y, including a
commercial paper programme, a CDollars 100m (Pounds 48.5m) issue of secured
debentures, and a bond issue secured by First Canadian Place, O&amp;Y's flagship
building in downtown Toronto. It confirmed the ratings on three other O&amp;Y
buildings in Toronto, Calgary and Ottawa.
O&amp;Y is a private company and DBRS compiled its reports without access to the
parent company's financial statements or cash flow data. A DBRS official
said the agency had been provided with some unpublished information, such as
rentals, vacancy levels and cash flows on buildings.
DBRS said it was concerned about rising office vacancy rates in New York and
Toronto, where 71 per cent of O&amp;Y's space is concentrated. The vacancy rate
in O&amp;Y buildings averages only about 10 per cent, but is concentrated in
relatively few buildings.
On the other hand, the agency notes that only about 23 per cent of O&amp;Y's
North American leases, measured by square footage, fall due before 1996,
with only 5 per cent expiring this year. Most of its buildings are prime
properties in choice locations.
O&amp;Y has already committed USDollars 3bn to Canary Wharf, but DBRS says that
Dollars 850m must still be found.
Canary Wharf is now starting to generate cash flow, but with the project
only about 60 per cent leased and many tenants offered costly up-front
inducements, DBRS concludes that the cash flow 'is not large'.
The value of O&amp;Y's stock portfolio has sunk to an estimated CDollars 3.9bn
from CDollars 5.3bn a year ago and CDollars 6.6bn in 1990.
According to DBRS, O&amp;Y's dividend income slipped to CDollars 209m last year
from CDollars 234m in 1990.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Vickers to cut final dividend after setback: Deficit reaches
Pounds 12.4m after sales halve at Rolls-Royce - Shares rise 7p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VICKERS, the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and Challenger tanks group, yesterday
cut its final dividend after incurring a loss of Pounds 12.4m before tax in
1991, down from a pre-tax profit of Pounds 96.5m.
The loss stemmed from Rolls-Royce where sales halved in 1991. However, the
dividend reduction was not as severe as some feared and the shares rose 7p
to 169p. Sir David Plastow, chairman and chief executive, described the cut
as 'prudent'.
The group is one of the first to report in the current results season and
its action will be noted by other companies who must decide whether to
reduce the payment to shareholders.
Vickers held its interim dividend at 3.7p, but warned last September that
the final might be cut if there was no improvement at Rolls-Royce. The
proposed final is 2.3p, down from 6.2p, to give a total of 6p, a fall of
39.4 per cent from 9.9p.
Analysts feared that the final dividend might be cut to 1p. They now expect
the new pay-out level to be sustainable. The 6p net dividend gives a gross
yield on the shares of 4.7 per cent at yesterday's closing price.
Group sales fell 16.2 per cent to Pounds 652.2m. The automotive division,
which includes Rolls-Royce, incurred a trading loss of Pounds 17.3m compared
with a profit of Pounds 41.2m, and also accounted for the bulk of a Pounds
34.4m exceptional charge relating to redundancy and rationalisation costs.
Aside from Rolls-Royce, Vickers's other divisions maintained trading profits
in aggregate. Defence and aerospace activities fell to Pounds 15.8m from
Pounds 18.1m. Last year Vickers won an order from the UK government for
Challenger 2 tanks which Sir David said would start to make profits in 1993,
and could lead to export orders. The defence order book is now Pounds 800m
against Pounds 200m a year ago.
After tax and the Pounds 16.2m cost of the dividend the retained loss was
Pounds 25.5m, against a profit of Pounds 38.4m. The balance sheet had net
debt at the year-end of Pounds 54.7m (against net cash of Pounds 11.5m last
time), 22.4 per cent of shareholders' funds. This gearing was lower than the

FT  25 FEB 92 / Time runs out on the road to survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse into loss of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars has come as an unpleasant
development at the end of the career of Sir David Plastow, chairman and
chief executive of Vickers.
Sir David retires at the end of May, and time is running out for him to put
in place a strategy to ensure the survival into the next century of one of
the world's most exclusive car marques.
Vickers' Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary suffered an alarming Pounds 90m
slide in its fortunes last year as losses of around Pounds 60m replaced a
profit of some Pounds 30m in 1990.
Now if the price is right Rolls-Royce is for sale, although there may be no
buyers about, at least at the price acceptable to Vickers.
BMW, the German executive and luxury carmaker, has been at the centre of
most speculation with City analysts insisting that Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim,
BMW chairman, visited the Rolls-Royce plant two weeks ago.
However, BMW countered yesterday with the apparently unequivocal statement:
'We deny that any negotiations are being conducted about BMW taking any sort
of shareholding, either minority or majority in Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.'
The Vickers board repeated yesterday that it was continuing 'to review the
options for the future of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars in the best interests of
shareholders'.
Sir David, insisted that in discussions to date 'we are not in the mode of a
100 per cent sale,' but he added that 'we cannot delete any option'.
Vickers faces a cruel dilemma. It cannot allow a distress sale in
mid-recession of a business that has produced consistent profits for two
decades. On the other hand it is being pulled into overall loss by a
business that needs an investment of more than Pounds 200m during the next
six years to develop a new product range.
The urgent review of the car business is bitter medicine for the Vickers
chairman. Sir David never dreamed the fortunes of the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars
business could fluctuate so wildly.
Almost with an air of disbelief at the scale of the losses, he insisted
yesterday that the car operations had 'averaged a 30-35 per cent return on
capital through the 1980s. It has a solid business record. It is not a flaky
business'.
Trading conditions for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, which includes the Bentley
marque, were 'the most difficult we have ever experienced,' he said.
Exceptional restructuring measures cost close to Pounds 35m with trading
losses amounting to Pounds 25m.
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars lost half its market in the face of the deep
recession in its two main markets, the US and the UK.
Sales worldwide fell 48.3 per cent to 1,723 - the lowest since 1968 - from
the record 3,333 in 1990. Sales in the UK halved to 513 from 1,007, while
sales in the US fell 65.2 per cent to 400 from 1,149 in 1990 and 1,216 in
1989.
Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers managing director, who is to take over as chief
executive in May, said the cost base at Rolls-Royce had been reduced by
Pounds 30m a year, lowering the break-even production level to around 2,000
cars a year.
Fixed costs have been reduced by 20 per cent and variable costs by 50 per
cent. The UK workforce was cut by more than a third last year to just over
3,100.
The recession allowed a new labour agreement to be pushed through finally
removing many restrictive practices that disappeared elsewhere in the motor
industry years ago. Team working has finally come to Crewe. The seven trades
unions at the site are to act as 'a single union', and the number of union
representatives has been cut from 110 to 40.
Cars are still only being produced three days a week, however, with two days
a week being devoted to training in new working practices.

FT  25 FEB 92 / A Roller is still the choice of chairmen, says poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN a greener and more frugal world, is the Rolls-Royce an endangered
species? Despite yesterday's grim sales figures for 1991, Rolls-Royce Motors
argues that its extremely expensive and rather old-fashioned vehicles still
have a future and it seems many UK company chairmen agree.
A straw poll published yesterday found that those who have traditionally
been chauffeured behind the Spirit of Ecstasy mascot intend to continue. No
one admitted to trading down on grounds of cost, while loyalty to the marque
and all it stands for remains high.
The majority of company chairmen remain loyal to their chosen make of car,
whatever it is, and most still buy British, many of them opting for Jaguar
or Daimler. Sir John Quinton of Barclays Bank is a long-term Jaguar driver
and Lord King of British Airways chooses Daimlers.
The big change enforced by the recession is that people are forced to
postpone trading-in an older model of Rolls for a new one. However given the
car's reputation for reliability, this is not generally regarded as a great
hardship.
Of the 116,000 cars produced since the company was founded in 1904, more
than 60 per cent are still on the road. A spokesman for Vickers,
Rolls-Royce's parent company said: 'They are the most ecologically sound car
you can buy.'
A Rolls-Royce spokesman said: 'Unlike volume carmakers we can keep in close
touch with our customers and there is a great loyalty, but because of the
recession now is not the time to be changing their cars. However, we feel
there is a pent-up demand out there and this will come through in sales once
the recession is over.'
An area where demand for Rolls-Royce cars may have dropped is in the luxury
chauffeur-driven business.
Camelot Barthropp, a subsidiary of the Savoy hotel group used to run five
Rolls-Royce Spirits, but now has only two. 'In the changing market Rolls are
no longer as popular as they were. People prefer Jaguars, Mercedes,
something a little smaller,' a company spokesman said.
Rolls-Royce is still a significant government choice to carry the ambassador
in more important postings like Washington, Moscow, Paris, Bonn and Tokyo.
Embassies with less prestige use Range Rovers, Jaguars and Rovers.
Recent reports have suggested that embassy Rolls were being sold off as a
cost-cutting measure, but a Foreign Office spokesman said that cars that had
been sold had been replaced.
'There has been no change in the number of Rolls-Royce vehicles in recent
years,' he said, but did not rule out reductions in the medium term.
Rolls-Royce blames the recession and the luxury car tax in the US, which has
hit foreign imports badly, for its current problems . It believes the top
models of Mercedes and BMW have been hit as badly by the two factors.

FT  25 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Severn Trent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The renewed weakness in Shanks &amp; McEwan's shares yesterday was a reminder
that the waste management sector will struggle to regain its premium rating
of old. It is perhaps instructive, then, to recall that many of the
privatised water companies, notably Severn Trent and Wessex, have high hopes
for the waste business as a source of non-regulated earnings.
Severn Trent paid Pounds 212m last May to buy Biffa from BET, an acquisition
which was always going to dilute its earnings in the short term, but which
appeared justified by its long-term promise. At the time of the interim
results seven months later, it acknowledged that Biffa was not doing as well
as expected. The subsequent further deterioration in its markets has almost
certainly again deferred the date when it will make a return. Judging by the
waste sector's recent experience, it is unlikely that Biffa will make much
more than Pounds 10m pre-tax this year: it could make significantly less.
Take off a reasonable Pounds 25m estimate for financing costs, and it looks
as if Severn Trent will suffer a Pounds 15m hit this financial year,
equivalent to earnings dilution of 6 per cent. There will be further
dilution in 1992-93.
While it is probably too early to judge the long-term case for
diversification into the waste business, it would seem reasonable for
investors at least to question Severn Trent's judgment. The question is
whether its shares will have to yield more than their prospective 7.7 per
cent as a result.

FT  25 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: NFC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's 4 per cent fall in NFC's shares was an appropriately modest
reaction to the gloomy company statement over the weekend. After all, the
dividend could yet be increased by 15 per cent this year and still be twice
covered. If pre-tax profits come in at the top end of the board's guess, the
group will not be very far from meeting earlier expectations. The shares
continue to yield a fifth less than the market average, so NFC's status as
one of the market's favourites in these recessionary times is barely
diminished. With its solid balance sheet and exposure to volume-sensitive
businesses, it is as set to benefit from economic recovery as it was last
year, during which the shares doubled in value. Investors will probably be
hanging on for the ride.
It was perhaps more curious that the market appeared rather sanguine about
the rest of the transport sector. If NFC is struggling, the likes of P&amp;O,
Ocean Group and Transport Development Group are doubtless finding life
somewhat tougher.

FT  25 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Cazenove
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoare Govett's deal with ABN Amro is welcome in one parochial respect. It
secures the future of a house that offers an alternative to Cazenove for
companies who prefer something other than the typical integrated merchant
banking operation. The problem with Cazenove, as its recent spat with
Steetley shows, is that its client list is simply too long. Companies need a
good broker more than ever at the time of a bid, but the chances are that if
one side is on the Cazenove list, so is the other. That was true not only of
BTR and Hawker Siddeley, but also of Ultramar and Lasmo. It is also the
reason for Cazenove's weekend untimely resignation as Steetley's adviser in
its defence against Redland.
Cazenove's practice is to stand down from both sides when there is a
conflict of interest on a bid, but to complete any business in hand. So
Steetley could reasonably have questioned where Cazenove would stand as
regards its Redland defence if its joint venture with Tarmac, another
Cazenove client, fell through. The unusual circumstances imposed a duty to
make absolutely sure Steetley knew the score. Cazenove's failure to do so
suggests a disturbing lack of circumspection in managing its multiple
relationships.

FT  25 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Hoare/ABN Amro
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At last the uncertainty is over for Hoare Govett. In ABN Amro it has found a
parent with ample financial muscle which promises to allow it considerable
independence. There is scope for links between Hoare Govett and the stock
broking businesses already owned by the Dutch bank in Amsterdam, Paris, and
Madrid. Less clear is how the purchase fits into ABN Amro's wider strategy.
Buying a share of the over-broked UK equity market is not necessarily the
most sensible proposition, even for a bank determined to diversify outside
its home market. But perhaps ABN Amro found Hoare Govett so affordable it
did not need to think very hard - on the most generous of assumptions it is
paying less than 2 per cent of group equity.
More likely, however, the purchase is part of a larger strategy for the UK
which will eventually mean other acquisitions. Hoare's management may yet
have to fight for its independence as the empire grows.

FT  25 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Vickers cuts it fine
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,559.7 (+17.4)
The market's reaction to Vickers' results confirms the market's unhealthy
preoccupation with dividends. Vickers' shares were marked up by over 4 per
cent on the strength of a smaller than expected dividend cut. Last week,
Shell's were marked down because its dividend increase did not quite match
inflation: British Aerospace's rose on relief that its dividend was
maintained.
Admittedly the reaction to both British Aerospace and Vickers suggests the
market has discounted a lot of bad news on dividends, so the downside risk
from here could be limited.
But the problem with the dividend obsession is twofold. Companies are
encouraged to pay too much because they are worried about the market's
immediate reaction. The market is tempted to value shares on short-run
dividend performance rather than underlying earnings prospects.
While there are still several questions over British Aerospace's future,
Vickers' case is less moot. Gearing is low, and the defence business is
doing well thanks to the Challenger order. But there is no real prospect of
an end to the slump in demand for Rolls-Royce cars. Nor has Vickers yet
found a partner to share Rolls-Royce development costs. Doubtless that will
continue to detract from the recovery prospects of the shares.

Sir, Why do we British, as a nation, have such an urge to indulge in
nostalgia when we try to improve our future? Moves by political parties to
create national networks of technology centres are welcome, but must we name
them after Faraday or Newton? ('Parties agree on technology plans', February
20).
Cannot inspiration be gained from the excitement and challenge of the future
without looking to names from the past? We must look forward or our fortunes

FT  25 FEB 92 / Letter: Lloyd's must be resolved without bitterness, abuse
and rancour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TOM BENYON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the wake of your article, 'Multiple damages on Lloyd's' (February
19), I wish to correct an impression that I have been promoting
'allegations. . . which must be treated with considerable caution'. I have
striven not to say things that were either gratuitously damaging or spread
rumours which seemed to be travelling quite fast enough without my help.
And, in any event, there are enough problems for my membership to cope with
without me having to invent more. Inter alia, I have not alleged that
malpractice is rife. Nor have I said that I thought Lloyd's faced a solvency
crisis.
On numerous occasions last week I was asked my views on these matters and I
have either refused to comment or I have denied the rumour that the
questioner hoped to confirm. Then I was repeatedly asked whether I was
calling for Mr Coleridge's resignation. I said that I thought he was doing
well in dreadful circumstances and what good would his resignation do
anyway? Then I was asked if I thought that self regulation should give way
to outside regulation? I said that I thought the present governance should
change but outside regulation might make matters even worse.
None of my replies was printed or broadcast.
Perhaps those who are sought by the media to comment would reflect that
competent soldiers always seek to ensure that the bits they shell do not
land back on to their own heads. And that explosions, flashes and smoke
presently generated might present a pretty spectacle for a time but the
reality is they obscure the real battleground.
We need quietly to settle down and work out what we are going to do about
the fact that 100 per cent of the losses have descended on to 25 per cent of
the membership. In such quantity, they face possible ruin now and certain
ruin in the next three years.
The fact these losses have fallen on those Names appears to be arbitrary.
Often, sufferers were not told of the risks attendant on the spiral
syndicates, nor could they tell a good agent from the not so good. They
trusted too much. This is seen by everyone (except the 75 per cent of the
membership who share cheques for around Pounds 500m) as manifestly unfair
and the engine for the current hysteria.
But mutualisation has already started in the Warrilow and Outhwaite
settlements. It must continue without bitterness, abuse and rancour and
without the process being towed endlessly through the courts and the media.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Letter: Finance - the common ground between management
disciplines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ARTHUR FORREST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There is some truth in Mr Willis' reply (Letters, February 20) to the
suggestion by Mr Akio Morita, chairman of Sony, that accountants should not
lead industry.
As with all generalisations, examples can be found to prove the point, but
neither Mr Willis nor Mr Morita can deny that the only real common ground
between disciplines in any business, whether in engineering or not, is
finance.
Relations with the workforce are not entirely influenced by money but the
level of the pay packet will always be an inescapable factor. How is a
company to afford competitive pay if it ignores the economics of its
products and markets?
A similar question arises over investment in the development of new
products. It is not enough to let ideas from the grass roots be turned into
products without considering the common ground of money where today's
investment is tomorrow's profit. Not many businesses will prosper without
these and other financial disciplines.
Certainly, vision and leadership in business is an essential ingredient for
success in the UK as well as in Japan and some accountants at the helm of
British industry lack such skills and could be criticised for detachment and
'short termism'.
However, the FT's report (February 20) of losses at Sony suggests the
emphasis on technology in management may not offer a foolproof solution
either.
Perhaps Mr Morita is wishing now he had a better balance between finance and
other skills in his boardroom.
